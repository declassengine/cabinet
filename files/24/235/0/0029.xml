THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1932.SECRET.                                               Copy No.   4?O.P.  429 (32).CABINET.THE  LANE-FOX  BACON  REPORT   AND   LONG-TERM                AGRICULTURAL  POLICY. Memorandum by the Minister of A gricidture and Fisheries, the President of the     Board of Trade and the Secretaries of State concerned with A gricidture in     Scotland and Northern Ireland.     1.   THE  Cabinet decided (Cabinet  55 (32),  Conclusion  8) that  before determining their policy in regard to the Report of the Lane-Fox Reorganisation Commission, they desired to see the draft heads of  a Bill setting out the Minister of Agricultui&apos;e&apos;s proposals.     2.   As the Cabinet are aware, discussions have taken place between the Board of Trade  and the Ministry of Agriculture  and Fisheries with a view to seeing how far proposals on the lines of the Lane-Fox recommendations could be reconciled with the need for arriving at favourable  understandings with those Continental countries with which the United Kingdom has entered, or is about to enter, into commercial negotiations.     3.   As a result of these discussions, it appears possible to say that these two objectives can, in practice, be harmonized.  The question is discussed in the accompanying inter-Departmental report (Appendix  B), which, as modified by the  Minister of  Agriculture&apos;s reservations, has now  been accepted by  the Ministers concerned, namely, the President of the Board  of Trade, the  Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.     4.  It has now become a matter of urgency for  the Cabinet to reach decisions on  questions of  principle.   Commercial negotiations have  been opened with Scandinavian countries, and it is necessary that  our negotiators should have the outlines of the Government policy in mind.  United Kingdom  farmers and curers also await a Government  announcement before starting the large amount of preparatory work which is necessary if the arrangements are to operate from the 1st  July next.     5.  The general question of regulation  of imports as  an integral part of the Governments agricultural  policy  has  been further discussed  between  the Departments immediately concerned, and we  are agreed that such regulation is justified      (i) where it appears to be essential for the effective working of a scheme for          reorganizing a branch of the agricultural industry (as in the case of          bacon), and     (ii) where it is necessary to avert an economic crisis (as at the present moment          in the case of meat).     6.  We are also agreed that it is necessary to  take corresponding power toregulate the home output.   This  is  recommended, as regards bacon, for example, in the Lane-Fox report.  The precise form which this power  should take in  thecase of Northern Ireland will require further consideration.  It may be foundnecessary to  empower   the  Government  of Northern Ireland to  regulate  thequantity  of Northern Irish  produce that may be sold in Great Britain.

    7.  We think that any legislation on these lines should include a provisionfor the appointment of a standing Committee to watch over the working of supplyregulation, to help in the elaboration of a  continuous  policy  and to adviseMinisters as to the best method of carrying it out.    8.  Heads of a Bill embodying these proposals have been drawn up and are circulated herewith (Appendix A).  We ask that the Cabinet should indicate its-provisional approval so  that Parliamentary Counsel may proceed with thepreparation of a draft Bill on these  lines for submission  to the Home AffairsCommittee.   The  Bill would  enable steps to  be  taken to carry out the  baconproposals.    9.  We also ask  that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should beauthorised to make, at  an early date,  an announcement that  the government accept the recommendations of the Lane-Fox Commission in principle, i.e., thatthey are prepared to take whatever steps are necessary  to establish a reorganisedbacon industry on  a firm footing, to provide for its expansion within reasonable limits, and to regulate imports,  by arrangement or otherwise, so far as may berequisite for the purpose.

APPENDIX A.DRAFT HEADS OF  A  BILL  TO AMEND  THE AGRICULTURAL MARKETING  ACT,    1931,  AND   TO   PROVIDE  FOR   REGULATING   THE   IMPORTATION  OF    AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS INTO THE  UNITED  KINGDOM.        I. Power to Regulate Importation of Agricultural Products.    1.  THE  Board of Trade may, by order, regulate the, importation of any agricultural product :     (a)  Where, after consultation with the Agricultural Ministers and with the          Market Supply Committee, it appears necessary to do so in order to          secure the efficient operation of a scheme, under the Agricultural          Marketing  Act,  1931,  and  corresponding legislation in Northern          Ireland, for regulating the marketing of an agricultural product;    (6)  where, after the  like consultation, it appears to  the  Board that  an          emergency has arisen affecting the economic stability of any branch          of the agricultural industry.    2.  Any Order made under this Section may contain such provisions as appear to the Board, after consultation as aforesaid, to be necessary for securingthe efficient operation of the scheme of regulation contained in the Order.    3.  Any Order made under (a) of  this Section may continue in force not-withstanding the revocation of the relevant marketing scheme provided that theAgricultural Ministers are satisfied that adequate measures are being taken tomaintain efficiency.   II. Power to Regtdate the Sale of Agricultural Products produced in the                             United Kingdom.    1.  The Agricultural Ministers, acting jointly, may, after consultation withthe Board of Trade and with the Market Supply Committee, by Order, regulate the quantity of any agricultural product produced in the  United Kingdom thatmay. be sold or offered for  sale therein, being a  regulated product within themeaning of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931, and a product of which imports are regulated by an Order under Section I above.    2.  Any Order made under this section may contain such provisions as appearto the Agricultural Ministers, after consultation as aforesaid, to  be necessary forsecuring the efficient operation of the scheme of regulation contained in the Order.              III.-Appointment  of Market Supply Committee.    1.  The Board of Trade, in consultation with the Agricultural Ministers,may constitute a committee, referred to as the Market Supply Committee, for thepurpose of affording advice and assistance in connection with the discharge oftheir functions under this Act, and, in particular, for making recommendations,from time to time, to secure the efficient operation of any scheme of regulation,contained in any Order made under this Act, as affecting the  quantity of  any agricultural product  that may  be imported into the  United Kingdom or thequantity of any such product produced in the United Kingdom that may be soldtherein.    2.  The Committee to consist  of a Chairman and not more than four othermembers.    3.  Provision to be made  for remuneration, etc., as in Section  16 of theAgricultural Marketing Act, 1931.       [7974]                                                     B  2
                IV. Power to constitute Development Boards.   \l.  Any two or more  boards operating under  the Agricultural MarketingAct, 1931, or under similar legislation in Northern Ireland, may submit a schemeto&apos; the  Minister (being the  Agricultural Minister or  Ministers  concerned)providing for the constitution of a Development Board to perform functions and services of common interest to the boards submitting the scheme.    2.  A Development Board to  consist of three persons  nominated by  theMinister, one of whom shall be Chairman, and of such other  persons as may be elected by the constituting boards in accordance with the provisions of the scheme.    3.  The scheme to set  out the functions, powers and duties of the Develop-ment  Board and provide  for the expenses of the Board being borne by  theconstituting boards In the proportion and manner provided in  the scheme.V. Orders to be Laid  before Parliament and Require Affirmative Resolution.    1.  Any Order may be varied by a subsequent Order and  shall cease to haveeffect  on the expiration of a period of 28 days from the  date on which it wasmade,  unless it has  been approved  by  resolution  passed by each  House ofParliament, but without prejudice to anything previously done  thereunder orto the making of a new  Order.,    2.  In reckoning a  period of 28  days.as aforesaid, no account to be  taken of any time during which Parliament  is dissolved  or prorogued, or during whichthe Commons House is  adjourned for more than  4  days.                             VI. Definition.    &quot;Agricultural Product&quot; has  the  same meaning as in the  agricultural marketing  Act,  1931.  VII. Miscellaneoxis Amendments of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931.    Apart from a number  of minor amendments which experience has  shown tobe desirable or which are necessary to carry out the  Lane-Fox scheme, there willbe one. major amendment (pressed for by the Treasury) to provide that the costof Reorganization Commissions constituted under the Act may be recoverablefrom marketing boards subsequently set up; it is proposed  to extend this amend-ment,  at the request of the industry, to provide for preliminary expenses incurred by promoters of  schemes, being recoverable in like manner.    Ministry of  A griculture and Fisheries,             December 9, 1932.APPENDIX  B.    INTER-DEPARTMENTAL REPORT ON THE BACON PROPOSALS AS AFFECTING                       NEGOTIATIONS WITH DENMARK.         Reservations by the  Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.   . I AM.prepared to agree to the proposals  outlined in the accompanyingReport subject to the following two reservations:     1.  The joint report provides  for a starting figure of 2 million cwt. for the          home quota on the 1st July, 1933, and for the Lane-Fox progression to          start-on the 1st January, 1934;  this will give a possible home quota          by  the end of 1935  of  approximately double our present output, say,          3-^  million cwt.  This arrangement is reasonable, but, with conditions
      as they are just now, there is a risk that the volume of home supplies      offered for contracts may exceed 2 million cwt. next summer.  It would      be politically very difficult to turn pigs away from  British bacon      factories at so early  a date in the working  of  the  scheme. ( I  am      prepared provisionally to accept the figure of 2 million cwt., but I think      it should be made clear that if this figure is to be used in discussions      with the Danes, it should only be as an estimate.  If by any chance the      starting-point of  the home quota has to be higher than. 2 million cwt.,      I am, however, prepared to support an arrangement to secure that the      home quota will not exceed during the three-year period of the Danish      Agreement  the figure of approximately S-% million cwt. suggested in      the joint report.2.  The Government  must retain an  overriding  emergency  power, in  the      interests of  all suppliers to the market, to deal with imports if prices      fail to respond to the initial quota arrangements or if an acute price      fall should  develop at any time subsequently.  We are handling an      entirely new situation  in an entirely new  way and we must keep  our      arrangements reasonably flexible while we gain experience.                                           (Initialled)       W. E. E.December 8, 1932.INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  REPORT  ON  THE  BACON  PROPOSALS        AS AFFECTING  NEGOTIATIONS  WITH DENMARK.    1.   We are  asked to advise on the question how the essential proposals ofthe Lane-Fox Reorganisation Commission for Pigs and Pig Products can best be reconciled with the necessity, in the course of the forthcoming negotiations,of coming to a definite understanding with  Denmark in  regard to her futureexports of bacon to this country.Commission^ Proposals.    2.   The essence of the Commission^ scheme is that a minimum price (basedon the cost of feeding-stuffs) for the supply of bacon pigs under yearly contracts should be fixed by negotiation between the Pigs Marketing Board and the BaconMarketing Board,  and that  the supply which will be forthcoming at this priceshould be protected; with the proviso that the supply shall not be allowed toincrease at a greater rate than 10 per cent, every four months.  The method ofprotection proposed is a limitation of imports and the extent of the limitationproposed is  such as will reduce the total supplies of  bacon  and hams to theaverage of the years 1925-30, i.e., 10,670,000  cwts., as compared  with 13,308,000cwts. in the abnormal year 1931.  In other words, it is estimated that a reductionof imports of this order will be necessary to maintain wholesale prices at a level which will enable the bacon factories to pay a remunerative price for pigs.  Thescheme is to come  into force on the 1st July, 1933, for a preliminary period of six months, and  the quotas of home production and imports will be  fixed there-after for each calendar year.Position of Denmark.    3.   From the point of view7 of our negotiations with Denmark, half of whoseexports to this country consist of bacon (in 1930 bacon represented  27 million,out of a total of  54  million retained imports into the United Kingdom  from denmark),  it is  desirable to give  some definite limits  below  which exports ofbacon will not be reduced (by Government action) for a stated period.    It has already been decided that agreements to be made with foreign countriesin respect of tariffs should be of a limited duration and the period suggested isthree years.  It  may be assumed, therefore, that the  agreements with denmark and Sweden, two of the countries with which negotiations are about to commence,should run for a period of three years as from, approximately, the 1st January,1933.    The figures of the Lane-Fox scheme are necessarily to some degree speculative,even for the immediate future.   It-cannot be  certainly, known, what the minimum
Gpig price, or the corresponding wholesale bacon price will be, what reduction oftotal supplies will be necessary to maintain them, and what the increase of home production and consequent reduction of imports will be.   We have, however, madewhat appear to us the most reasonable assumptions as to the probable position inthe next three years.    Home output has already been stimulated by the prospect of some regulationof imports, and it does not appear safe to assume that the contracts to be offeredon the  1st July next will represent a rate of production less than 2 million cwts.a year, or that it would be fair to fix a lower limit.  We assume this rate of home production  for the last half of  1933 increasing  thereafter  by  the  proposedmaximum of 10 per cent, every four  months.    The Lane-Fox  proposal is that the import  quota, i.e.,  the balance (afterdeduction of the  home production) of the  estimated total supply of 10,670,000cwts., should be based on the rate of  home production in the first four months ofeach year; any increase in the rest of the year is to take care of itself.    On these assumptions the home output  and the permissible imports of bacon and ham in the period 1933-35 would be as follows:  	Home Output.	Import.	Percentage of i931 retained Imports.	Percentages of Average retained Imports, 1925-30.1933 (2nd half) 1934 .. .. 1935	&apos;000 cwts. 1,000 2.200 2,928	&apos;000 cwts. 4,335 8,470 7,742	75 (annual 73-3 G7-0	97-2 rate) 95-0 86-8    .4.  The total import quota of bacon and ham must, of course, be distributedamongst the various countries from which our supplies have been drawn, and thenatural course would be to make each country&apos;s quota a proportion of the totalimports from that country  during a specified  basic period.   This period neednot coincide with the period 1925-1930 inclusive, which has been taken by theLane-Fox Commission as the basis  for calculating the  total United Kingdomconsumption; indeed, it might be inequitable to base the allocation of quotas upona period which omitted the last two years.    On the whole it seems desirable that the basic period should end at the latestpracticable date before the  recent restriction of imports, and that it should bean integral number of ye&quot;ars, in order to eliminate the effect of seasonal fluctua-tions, which may differ in different countries.   To adopt the year 1932 would beopen to the objection that the beginning of the  period would be a date very  soon after the date on which the United Kingdom  went off the gold standard, andmight, therefore, be unfair  to countries which  have remained on gold.   On theother hand,  to take too long a period would be manifestly unfair to countries whose trade with us in bacon has developed during recent years.  On the whole,therefore, it would seem that the most suitable basic period for this  purpose  isthe period of two years ended the 31st October, 1932, that month being the lastcomplete month  before the  enforcement  of the recent emergency  restriction.This would give  Denmark a quota of 62-3 per cent, of all imports.    The fact that for the purposes of the recent emergency restriction of baconimports the quotas allotted to the different countries were based on the quantitiesimported during the three months August, September, October 1932, need hardly be taken into account, as that was only a  restriction for a short period, and was naturally based  on the position at the moment.  It was made clear at the  time that the arrangement was not in any sense to be  taken as a precedent in theallocation of quotas ;for any longer period.  -  5.  Assuming that permanent bacon  quotas are allotted on the basis of thetwo years ended  &apos;tjhe 31st October, 1932, it would  appear possible (subject, however,to, what is said below as regards Canada) to  guarantee to  Denmark that herexportsi,ofbacon to\this country will not  be  reduced  to  a  quantity less than&apos;4,823,000&apos; cwts, iii any of the next three years! provided that the requirements ofthe scheme as to quality, &amp;c&apos;., are&apos; satisfied.  This reduction; which is a reductionof 34-3. per cent, on, Denmark&apos;^ exports in  1931; may appear to be substantial,but;weare&apos;;informepl that&apos; its practical effect \yill be &quot;minimized ,by the fact that
Denmark is on the downgrade of the pig cycle.   The Danish Pig Census ofJuly 1932 already discloses a fall of 22 per cent, in the number of breeding sows,and the Ministry of Agriculture and  Fisheries are of opinion that in the normal course the output of bacon and hams would decrease in the near future by some20-25 per cent., with a probable further decrease to follow.  It is, in  fact,  hotimprobable that Denmark will  recognise that an attempt to stabilise supplies and prices in the United Kingdom market is likely to do her more good than harm.This at any rate is a point of view  upon which we think our negotiators mayfairly lay stress.  It is not so  much that we want to curtail Denmark&apos;s exportsto us in the next year or  so (they will decline in any case) as that we want toprevent them from expanding again to their previous totals.    6.   The value to British trade of a favourable arrangement with Denmarkwould be considerable.  The balance of trade between the two countries  in recentyears has been heavily in favour of Denmark.  In 1930 United Kingdom retained imports from Denmark wrere   53-6 million  and exports to Denmark   10-million, and this proportion is fairly typical.  The principal British exports toDenmark are coal, textiles, and iron and  steel manufactures.   The UnitedKingdom share in the Danish  market for coal fell from 96-6 per cent, in 1924to 43-5 per cent, in 1931, and one of our  objects in the forthcoming  trade negotiations will be a return to the 1924 proportions.  It is understood that the danish Government and the other coal purchasing interests concerned are alreadyfavourably  disposed in  principle towards this object,  and, at  the latter&apos;invitation, a United Kingdom  coal trade delegation is visiting Copenhagen withthe object of dispelling any doubt as to the capacity of the United  Kingdom tosupply classes of coal suitable  for the Danish requirements.    On the other hand, the value of our market to Denmark is so great (over two-thirds of her total exports  having come here in the first nine months of 1932)that  she may reasonably be asked to make considerable concessions for an assured,if reduced, share of our import  trade.Policy beyond Three-Year Period.    7.  There is a further consideration likely to influence the Danes.    TheLane-Fox Report, which they will have studied with attention, might be read asforeshadowing an indefinite expansion of our pig production at the rate  of 10 percent, every four months until our importations cease altogether.  We suggest thatthe Government should give no guarantee that the Lane-Fox policy of expansionwill be carried beyond the year 1935.  We further suggest that the Danes mightbe assured  (again on the  assumption that they are reasonable)  that any stepsinvolving a further increase of our pig production and a further contraction ofimports would only be taken after full discussion with the chief suppliers to. our market: this, however, raises  a large question of policy, which Ministers stillwish to consider.    The problem of regulating  bacon  supplies  does  not appear  to  us  to beessentially different from that of beef and mutton  supplies, and must, in the end,we suggest,  be dealt with on  similar lines.   Special difficulties in the case ofbacon are :  (1)  The multiplicity of sources of supply and lack of organisation;(2) the phenomenon of the Pig Cycle; and (3) our liability to Canada; but thepossibilities of a voluntary arrangement,  to which  the  Commission  refer inparagraph  13 of their Report, should be fully explored.Canadian Position.    8.  In the above  calculation, Dominion  imports have not been separatelyconsidered.   Importations from the Irish Free State in 1931 were 2-6  per cent.of the total.  In 1928 the proportion was as high as 5-8 per cent.   For present purposes we have assumed that the Irish Free State will have her 1931 proportionof the total importation.    The uncertain factor which  is liable to  upset  the whole calculation is  theundertaking in the Ottawa Agreement  with Canada &quot; that in any legislation which they  [United Kingdom]  may submit  to  Parliament for regulating  thesupplies of bacon and hams from all  sources into the United Kingdom provision will be made for free entry of  Canadian bacon and hams of good quality up to amaximum of 2,500,000 cwts. per annum.&quot;    The importation from Canada in 1931 was 122,000 cwts. or 1  per cent, ofthe total.  In 1925 it was 1,455,000 cwts. or 16-2 per cent, of the total, and  has
obeen declining steadily since.  We consider that the Canadian Government shouldbe asked at once to furnish at the earliest possible date estimates of the quantitiesthey propose to send to the United Kingdom  in 1933, and  (so far as  possible)in the two succeeding years, and a telegram putting this enquiry is being sent.     If Canada insists on being able to claim 1\ million cwts.  in each of the threeyears, there are three alternatives :      (1) to reduce overseas supplies (including presumably supplies from  other           British territories) proportionately.   This has the great disadvantage           of laying  the  Danish import open  to  a possible   reduction of           1,540,000 cwts. (i.e., 62-3 per cent,  of the maximum Canadian quota           less the imports from  Canada in  1931).   It  is  inevitable  that the           Danes would regard such a reduction,  which would  be a  further           reduction of 21 per cent, of their imports in 1931, with the greatest           resentment, and if the reduction has to be imposed it is very unlikely           that we shall reach a satisfactory agreement with Denmark;     (2) to place  the reduction  on  overseas supplies and home supplies  propor-           tionately.   This would  involve an  additional  reduction of  Danish           imports in 1931 of 17 per cent., and a reduction of 12-5 per cent, in           our own  average output in 1925-1930  (If million cwts.).   In this           event  we  should have to face the combined hostility of overseas and           domestic suppliers.  As the justification of  the legislation which will           be required  to enforce the quota system is that it will lead to an           increased home production, this alternative seems  to be an impossible           one;     (3)  to take no account of the possible  Canadian import.  The effect of this           alternative  would be completely to  upset the stability  of the bacon           market and undermine the basis of the whole scheme, and it is one           which neither Danish nor home producers could contemplate.    At the moment, the only possibility open seems to be to  await, the  reply ofthe Canadian Government, and to hope  that by negotiation  with them and the danes a not unreasonable working scheme may be evolved.    We  have ascertained that the Scottish  Office  and the  Department ofAgriculture in Northern Ireland are  in agreement with our  views.                       (Initialled)       A. W. S.
