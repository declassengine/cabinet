Summary of Reports made to the Board of Trade              Advisory Council in connection, with their meeting, on              Novemher 10th. 1932 (supplemented in some cases with                        information from other sources).  &quot;              Employment -  Instead of an increase in unemployment         which generally speaking, occurs in October, there was a         decline this year, and on October 24th, - when 2,747,000         persons were on the registers of Smployment Exchanges in Great         Britain - the number of persons unemployed was 111,000 less         than on September 26th.  Of this decrease 57,000 were men,         39,000 were women and 15,000 were juveniles.  In Scotland,         the Northern Divisions of England and the Midlands Division         the decreases were 6,000, 75,000 and 45 ,000&quot;&apos;respectively;         on the other hand in Wales, in London and in the Southern         Districts of England there was an aggregate increase of         15,000.  There were 246,000 more insured workers in         employment on October 24th than on September 26th, but         51,000 less than in October 1931.  About half the increase         since September 26th was due to the resumption of work upon         the termination of the dispute in the manufacturing section         of the cotton industry.  The improvement was mainly in coal-         mining, the cotton, woollen, worsted, jute and hosiery         industries, general engineering and motor industries;         seasonal declines continued in the building industries, public         works contracting, the distributive trades and in the hotel,         boarding house, road transport and shipping services.              Overseas Trade -  The Overseas Trade of the United         Kingdom (imports, domestic exports and re-exports) showed a         substantial seasonal increase in October over  that of         September;  all the principal classes of goods - viz. food,         drink and tobacco; raw materials; and manufactured articles         shared in the general  increase.  The excess of imports over                                       -1-
exports of merchandise in October amounted to  26.7 millions,which was  1.6 millions greater than in the previous month, and 15.9 millions less than in October 1931.  For the period January-October imports were  121.0 millions, domestic experts  23.7millions a;id re-exports  10.8 millions less than in thecorresponding period of 1931, while the excess of imports overexports was reduced by  86.5 millions ti*  236,7 millions.     Rail and Road Traffic- For the four weeks ended 30th OctoberRailway revenue decreased by  1,141,000 - or 9,6 per cent, -compared with the corresponding period of last year.  The rate ofdecrease was not so pronounced as for the month of September when,compared with September 1931, the decline was 11.1 per cent.  Theimprovement was shared by all classes of traffic;  passenger traffic reoeipts oontinued to show the smallest percentage ofdecrease, i,e. 4.1 for the month of October, and 6,8 for the43 weeks ended 30th October ** the comparison being in each case with the corresponding periods of 1931,     Hew registrations of motor cycles and of other motor vehicles in September increased by 159 and 2,860 (or 64 per cent, and 25.per cent) respectively, compared with September 1931.     Goal-mining -  The average number of persons employed in theindustry for the 13 weeks ended October 22nd was 776,200 comparedwith 824,200 for the corresponding period of 1931.  The averageoutput for the same 13 weeks was 3,749,000 tons or 9 per cent.less than in the corresponding period of last year.  The demandfor coal for inland consumption showed no signs of increasing.Exports during the 10 months ended 30th October amounted to32,419,000 tons compared with 35,580,000 tons in the correspondingperiod of last year.  The quantities shipped to most of the Ghiefmarkets declined, but there were increased exports to Finland,the Soandanavian oountries and Canada.  The exports of anthracitein January-October 1932 were 380,000 tons in excess of similarexports lti the corresponding period of last year.                             -2-
     Iron  and Steel - The virtual cessation of imports of pigiron into  the United Kingdom was attributed to the tariff and the depreciation of sterling, hut whilst there was an increasedactivity on the North East Coast and a few export orders were obtained for pig iron, there was no improvement in the market inScotland.   Tinplates and galvanized sheets were in somewhatbetter demand, principally for export;  the competition in the overseas markets for finished steel was, however, very severe.A further  order for steel plates for Russia was reported.   Theposition of heavy steel makers in South Wales was unsatisfactory.     Shi-shipping end Shipbuilding - The general position was practically unchanged;  although a few of the modern large boats were put into commission in anticipation of the shipment of thenew wheat  crops from Argentine and Australia, there was littlevariation  in the aggregate of laid-up tonnage.   The freight index&apos;figure, which advanced to 81.46 in September, fell to 79.49 inOctober.   Contracts for 3 small steamers for the coasting trade were pieced during the month.     Machine Tools - There were indications of a slightimprovement in the home demand for machine tools.   The value ofimports of machine tools declined from  1,217,000 in the 10 months ended 3lst October, 1931, to  775,000 in the  corresponding periodof 1932;   on the other hand, comparing the same periods of 1931 and1932, exports of similar tools Of British manufacture increased from  1,470,000 to  2,675,000.     Electrical Industry - There was no marked change in theproportion of productive capacity occupied during October.   Theindex of home orders received for heavy plant declined from 60 inSeptember to 58 in October;   the index for exports, which hasregistered an almost continuous decline since August 1931,  rose from 66 in September to 67 in October.   The  amount ofelectricity generated by authorised undertakings during the ten months ended 31st October increased by 535 million units, or                                 -3f
nearly 7 per- cent., compared -with the corresponding periodof last year.     Motor Industry - The improvement in the home trade  whichwas noticeable during August and September continued  throughoutOctober, the demand being more pronounced for cars of low horsepower;  the competition from imported cars was not serious;exports continued to expand and showed signs of covering a widerfit/Id.   The recent exhibition at Olympia which attracted agreater number of Continental visitors then usual was regardedas a  success from the business point of view.     Cotton - The settlement of the dispute in the weavingsection of the industry was followed by a marked improvement inactivity, and sales continued to expand up to the middle ofOctober;  subsequently there was a reaction, followed by adecline in production, but the general situation was  regarded as more hopeful than it had been for some time.   There  was also a fairly general improvement in the cotton industries abroad,particularly in Europe and the United States.   Exports of piecegoods from Japan reached a record figure of 208 million square yards in August - a figure which exceeded British exports forthe first time since September 1931.   The exports of cotton piece goods of United Kingdom manufacture in the period January-October were valued at  36,796,000, compared with  31,568,000,and  54,919,000 in the corresponding periods of 1931  and 1930respectively.     Wool - wool sold freely in the primary markets.    Comparedwith September (and also with October 193l) employment inOctober 1932 showed a decided improvement in all the  principaldepartments and districts of the woollen and worsted industries.The increase in m&amp;ehinery activity was at a  rate that was somewhat higher than that which normally occurs at this seasonof the year.    Compared with the corresponding period of lastyear  the value of exports of woollen and worsted manufactures(apart from wool tops) declined during January-October;   the                              &apos;  -4-
exports of wool tops of United Kingdom manufacture increased inthe same periods from  1,610,000 to  2,460,000.    From the pointof view of the woollen and worsted industries the results of the ottawa Agreements were regarded as somewhat disappointing.     Silk and Artificial Silk - Throwsters in the silk industry were well occupied and there was a good demand for twists for thehosiery trade;  a slightly improved demand was also apparentfrom manufacturers.   Foreign competition was still severe,The spun silk trade continued in a depressed condition.    Therewas a  hopeful tone in the reports relating to the trade inhosier^, scarves, knitted outerwear, &amp;c   In the making-upsection prices were at a low level and the hulk of the business was from large retailers who were buying steadily in regularguantitles.   The export trade showed no improvement.     Other Industries. - The building industry was very quiet andnot so good as last month;  there were no signs of improvement.In the chemical industry there was a general improvement in thehome trade;  the concessions secured by the Ottawa agreements were regarded as substantial and likely to be of immediatebenefit;  the procedure agreed in regard to Tariff Boards willprobably be of  considerable value for obtaining adjustments of duties.   In the boot and shoe industry the general state oftrade was disappointing although some firms reported a slight increase in orders.   For September the estimated production was833,000 dozen pairs compared with 854,000 dozen pairs inSeptember 1931.   In the motor tyre trade there was considerableactivity in the home market, except for motor cycle tyres;  the improved demand for tyres for pedal cycles continued.     The Wheat Situation - The world market was dominated bythe surplus of wheat which was available in Canada and in theUnited States;  average prices during the past month have fallenat Liverpool, Chicago and Winnipeg by about 2/-, 4/10 and 2/6per quarter respectively.    Production was lower in 1932 than
1931 in Russia, Poland and the Danubian oountriesj   generouscrops were harvested in Western Europe, particularly in France,Germany, Italy and Spain.   In Australia the new crop was ofgood quality and the yield satisfactory.   Since 1st August,Canada was the chief exporting country;  shipments from Russiashowed a great deorease oompared with 1931, imports into theUnited Kingdom from that country deolining from 23.8 millionowts. in the 10 months ended October 1931, to 3.1 million owts.in the corresponding period of 1932.                                                                   I     Retail  Prices - In October the money value of sales inGreat Britain was 303 per oent. less than in October of lastyear;  the peroentage reduotion for the period February -October compared with the corresponding period of 1931 was 4*7.The cost value of stocks at the end of October was 6o9 per cent.less than in   October 1951.   In the United States and Germanyretail sales deolined by 23 per oent. and 20.3 per cent.respectively in the period January to September oompared withthe corresponding period of 195It     Finance - During October the banking situation was virtuallyunohanged;  the volume of deposits continued to increase andthere was little demand for advances for the purposes ofindustry and business.   The average rate for October at whichTreasury Bills were allotted  was 14s.9d. per cent, comparedwith ail average of lls.ld. per cent, for September.  during october there was a partial re-opening of the issue market.Sterling exchange moved adversely to this country during thelatter part of the month, the rate on New York falling at onetime to 3c28*   The exchange restrictions in force in many countries continued to be barriers to the improvement andresuir.pt3.on of international trade.     Canadian Trade - In September the volume of business showedlittle change but there was a alight advance in the general levelof commodity prices compared with the previous month.  The minin;:
                                                        -       c:industry was more active than in August;  the index for manufacturing industries declined, however, from 75*5 in august to 74.? in September.   The index figure for employment rose from 86 on 1st September to 8o.7 on 1st October:  the increasein the number of employed was mainly in vegetable food andtextile manufactures and In the retail trad.e.     Australian Trade - Trade, during the 3 months July to september, was as follows (in Australian currency) - TotalImports  19,191,000;  Total Exports  19,016,000;  thecorresponding figures for 1931 were  13,462,000 and  18,007,000respectively.   Shipments of flour, butter, eggs and egg pulpfrom 1st July to the end of October showed substantial increases,whilst wheat and meat showed decreases compared with thecorresponding period of the previous year.  Bank clearings inSydney for the 10 months ended October declined by  190,527,000and in Melbourne by  27,S24,000, compared with the correspondingperiod of 1831.     South American Trade - The continuance of exchange restrictions and the low prices obtainable for produoe were thechief hindrances to any appreciable expansion of export trade.In Brazil the  Federal Government assumed responsibility forcurrency issued by the revolutionaries;  the export of coffeewas resumed at the port of Santas and commercial affairs were approaching normality.   Business conditions generally were difficult in all the Republics.     Indian Trade - The general trade position was fairly satisfactory;  the figures for September showed that the seasonalrecovery which normally occurs In October or November commencedrather earlier than usual.   The balance of trade in favour ofIndia during each of the 5 months May to September was (in croresof rupees) one, two, three, three, seven and a half.  Prices were fairly steady;  the index numbers of wholesale prices in Calcutta.for the same five months were 89, 86, 87, 91 and 91 respectively.                          -7-
