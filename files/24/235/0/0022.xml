              FIFTH  REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, November 1932.                         I. Recent developments.    THE phase of the economic crisis which we have now reached is one  ofpeculiar interest.  In mid-summer there began an upward movement in wholesale prices, and a recovery on the principal stock markets of the world, which attaineda strength and exhibited for some time a persistence comparing very favourably with the short-lived recoveries which had  previously interrupted  from time totime the deepening of the present  depression.   This movement gave rise to a widespread hope that the corner had at last been definitely turned,  a hope whichderived support from various other factors. The stocks of many of the principalcommodities  had ceased  to increase some time  previously.   The  underlyingfinancial and  monetary conditions requisite for recovery had been created both inthe United States, as the result of the reflation activities of the Federal Reservebanks and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and in Great Britain as theresult  of  the conversion  scheme.  The Lausanne  agreement encouraged  the expectation of a final settlement of the troublesome problems of reparations and war debts.  The improvement  in the commodity markets and stock markets was accompanied  accordingly  by a decided strengthening of business  and financialconfidence throughout the world, and by something like a wave of optimism inthe United States.    2.  In so far as this optimism extended to  Great Britain, it had largelyevaporated in recent weeks.  The recovery of commodity prices has as yet failedto stimulate any material  increase in the volume of industrial activity, nor are there  any indications that such an increase is likely in the near  future.   Thedecline in the  volume   of international trade  continues  quite  unchecked.Meanwhile prices have undergone a substantial set-back both  in the commoditymarkets and  the stock markets.  The international outlook has again becomeclouded, and there are renewed misgivings on many matters, including that of the stability  of  the sterling exchange.   For  the  time  being  such  industrialimprovement  as has  occurred is overshadowed by anxiety over the debt settlement.    3.  Before attempting to appraise the main drift of the tendencies which areat work, it will be desirable to set out the relevant facts in greater detail.Commodity prices reached their  lowest  level, both  in this  country  and in theUnited States during June. Their  subsequent course is set out in  the followingtable:                                  TABLE 1.                             Commodity prices.

November 16 ...It will be observed that  a great part of the rise in prices which  took place inJuly, August and the beginning of September has now disappeared.   In theUnited States the Irving Fisher index, which showed a rise of 6 per cent, onthe 7th  September as compared with the 29th June, is  now only 1-5 per cent.above the  latter  level.   In  Great Britain  the corresponding  increases, asshown by the Economist complete  index, are 10 per cent, and 6-5 per cent.,the difference being  largely due to the depreciation  which has taken place inthe value of sterling.   i&quot;t must be remembered that neither  of  these  indicesfaithfully reflect  the movement of  wholesale prices in the countries  concerned.United Kingdom.

The most accurate indices, namely, the Board of Trade index in this country, and the-Bureau of Labour index in the United States, show considerably smaller movements. Although these price movements were most apparent in the more speculative commodities they were of a. general character, both at the time when price indices were rising, and during the recent -fall. In view of the speculative attention which they excited, it is perhaps desirable to give a brief outline of the prices of wheat and cotton during the last five months., ....

It will be observed that whereas the fall in the price of commodities was reflected in a fall in the value of both classes of American shares, in Great Britain, fixedinterest  bearing  shares continued  to  advance  until  November, when  theyunderwent  a  substantial set-back.  From the point of view of this country thefall in American fixed interest shares, at a time when the sterling exchange is farfrom strong, is a most unwelcome development.     5.  In the United States September saw a rise in all the major indices ofbusiness activity greater than was to be expected from the normal  autumn move-ment.  For example, the Federal Reserve Board index of production showed anincrease after allowing for seasonal factors from 58 in July to 60 in August, and again to 66 in September.  Similarly, the index of factory employment rose from58 - 3 in July to 58 - 8 in August and to 60 - 3 in September.  The present indications are that the improvement suggested by these figures continued up to the  middle-of October, but  that more  recently there  has not been much further advance.We may quote, for example, the weekly index of business activity published by theNew York Times, which runs as follows : Week	November.

There have also been some slight indications of improvement in certain European countries.  In France, for example, the index of industrial production rose from 92 in July to 93 in August, and both in September and in October there has been a reduction in the numbers registered as unemployed.   In Germany there has been a progressive reduction in the numbers registered as unemployed from 6,128,429 in February to 5,223,810 in August.  This reduction is in part seasonal, and in part due to stricter administrative measures.   It may be observed that the improvement has not been reflected in the percentage of unemployed published by trade  unions.   In  September  the  number of  registered  unemployed  again increased, though only by approximately 40,000.    7.   The German situation  is complicated by the steps recently taken by the government to  alleviate the depression, which we think it desirable to  describe briefly.  The essence of the  scheme is that the government should assist industry in part  by a remission of  taxation,  in part by a  direct subsidy calculated in accordance with the increase in employment effected by individual firms  over the level prevailing during the months June, July and August of 1932.  As, however, the government has  no ready money with which to  make remissions of taxation or to pay subsidies, the scheme is to be financed  by the issue of certificates, which will be accepted  in  the years 1934 to 1938  at  their face  value plus interest at 4 per cent, (simple) in payment of taxes then falling due.   These certificates are to be dealt in on the Stock Exchange, and are to  be acceptable security for bank overdrafts.   In effect the government  is mortgaging  its future revenue in an attempt  to bring  about  an immediate  improvement of trade.   The scheme is obviously not without its dangers, prominent among which is the possibility that it may entail a depreciation  of the mark, or more probably difficulties in meeting payments in respect of interest on foreign debts.  In view of the precariousnessof the German foreign exchange position if the scheme is successful in its avowed object of bringing about an improvement in internaltrade, the increase in imports which, in view of Germany&apos;s present lack of raw materials,  this would entail, might have serious repercussions.    8.  In Great Britain, the trend of  the unemployment figures has continued upwards until October.  The total number registered as unemployed rose from 2,747,000 in June to 2,812,000 in July, and to 2,860,000 in August.   In September the figure  was virtually unchanged  at  2,858,000, but fell back to 2,747,000 in
October.  The improvement in October was most marked in Lancashire,  where,however, employment was influenced by abnormal causes, both in September, when there was a  stoppage in  progress in the manufacturing  section of the cottonindustry,  and in October, when the spinning section was threatened with a stoppage.  It may  have been partly due to the expectation  of  an impendingstoppage of work in the cotton industry.  But the other chief industrial regionsalso showed  a decided improvement,  in contrast to the south of England, wherethere has been  a  slight  further increase in  the  numbers  unemployed.  Ininterpreting  these  figures of  unemployment,  it must be remembered  that  thenumbers of new entrants into industry has shown a considerable decline duringthe last two years.   In part this is probably due to the fact that some of those whowould normally have joined the ranks of the  insured population have, owing to thedifficulties experienced in obtaining work during the present  depression, remainedoutside it.  For this reason,  and on account of changes in administration,  the published figures of  unemployment may  understate not  only  the volume ofunemployment existing at  any time, but also the extent to which it has increased in recent months. We give in the following table figures showing  the changes inthe volume of employment  which have taken place in the last few months.

It must be remembered, of course, that thetotal numbers of the employable population are still tending to increase.    9.   Meanwhile,  as  stated  above,  the volume  of international trade  hascontinued to decline steadily.  The value and volume of British exports for thelast quarter has continued to decline.

These figures suggest that while the value of world trade has been reduced toabout one-third of that in 1929, the present volume of world trade is about half ofthat  in 1929.   This,  however, probably  exaggerates  the  decline  in volume.We give the United States Bureau of Labour index of prices, as it is perhaps.the best available.   But no index of internal  wholesale prices is likely to reflectaccurately changes in the prices of goods traded between nations.  It is probablethat  the actual fall  in the latter is greater than that shown  in  the Bureau ofLabour index.     11.  The general course of production  during the last twelve months at home-and abroad is given in the  following table.

                 II. An appreciation of the present position.     12.  The general impression which we draw from  the  above survey  is as follows:  In recent months there has been a general strengthening of internal financial  positions.    The  acute  sense of  financial crisis,  the  widespread apprehension that an unlimited  series of catastrophic  and  sensational bank- ruptcies might lie ahead, the uneasy feeling that no firm ground was to be found anywhere in the financial world, have largely disappeared, and it seems probable that, in the majority of countries, they have disappeared for good.  We regard it as probable, that is to say,  that, so far as financial confidence is  concerned, the worst  point of the crisis has been  passed, and we should be surprised if, for example, the prices of the better  class American bonds,  though they are ruling very weak at present, were to fall again to so low a level as that of midsummer.     13.  This strengthening of internal financial confidence is, so far as it goes, a helpful factor to trade, and its influence on trade activity is likely to be important in proportion to the acuteness of the  previously existing financial distrust.  In the United States, accordingly, where financial panic has been especially marked, and where  production has undergone an exceptionally severe decline during the past twelve months, it is possible that the improvement of the financial tone will suffice to bring about an appreciable increase m the volume of business activity.     14.  Other  forces are, however,  at  work  adverse  to  any  early trade improvement, and in  Great  Britain  these forces seem to possess a strength likely for some time to outweigh the beneficial effects of the improvement in the financial sphere. The chief of these forces is  the steady increase of the obstacles placed in the way of international trade.  The trend of trade restrictions, including tariffs, import prohibitions and exchange controls, is still prevailingly upwards,  and, so long as this trend continues, it appears inevitable that the  volume of international trade will continue to decline.     15.  There  is, moreover,  another  feature  of  the  situation of  which it  is necessary  to take account in attempting to assess the outlook for British trade. During the past twelve months, the uncertainties of the British tariff position, the fact that we had imposed tariffs  up to a certain point,  and  might,  but equally might  not, impose more drastic trade obstacles, have led to our being accorded exceptionally favourable treatment in certain markets.  In Denmark, for example, the system  of exchange control  has been so administered as to  stimulate the purchase of British goods.  The result has been that our exports to Denmark have actually increased during the present year.  During the first nine months of this year, although our trade with all  foreign countries decreased  from  163,129,000 to  147,621,000, trade with Denmark, in spite of a fall in values, and in spite of a general restriction of  Danish imports (from 1,024,200,000 Kr. to 805,500,000 Kr.). increased  from  6,254,000  to  7,009,000.   In  the  light of present tendencies, however, this improvement  must be regarded as somewhat precarious.     16.  It must further be remembered that  the depreciation of sterling has conferred on our export trade during the past year the advantage of an  improved competitive position,  an advantage which is subject to a process  of constant attrition, as our competitors adjust themselves to the position  either by reducing- their costs of production, or (as in the case  of Japan) depreciating their own currencies.  While, accordingly, during the past year we  have suffered much lessthan our proportionate share of the general decline in the volume of world trade, it is not unlikely  that we may suffer more  than our proportionate share of a further deterioration  of world trade in the next twelve months.     17.  Thus, although there are some signs of improvement in a number of industries, especially  in the north, we are unable to take a very optimistic  view of the  prospects  of  British trade and employment as a whole.    Despite the improvement in the financial outlook, the position remains  essentially as we stated it in the following passage in our third report, dated the 25th May, 1932 :          &quot; It is improbable, if world conditions continue  to deteriorate, that we     can retain for long even the limited good fortune that we have enjoyed during     the past eight  months, which is  largely   attributable  to  a sudden and       [7858]                                                     c 2
    essentially precarious improvement in our competitive power.    A world    recovery is thus in  our  judgment an  essential  condition  of  any lasting    improvement of British trade.&quot;We discussed the international problem at length in our fourth report, and madesuggestions there as to  the lines on which  in our judgment a solution should be attempted.    18.  At the best, however, no speedy improvement in the international spherecan be expected.   We turn, therefore, in the present report to consider certain aspects of the internal economic position of Great Britain.    19.  For some months after  the suspension of gold payments last year, therestoration of confidence in sterling was naturally the leading preoccupation ofBritish monetary and financial policy.  The distrust of the British position whichdrove us off the gold standard continued for a considerable period, and it was not until early this year, that the outward movement of foreign balances was reversed.The prospects of budgetary equilibrium in the coming year played an integral part in the restoration of  confidence in sterling at the end of 1931.    20.  The present situation, however, is materially different from that which existed twelve  months ago.  World confidence in the essential soundness of theposition of  Great  Britain has been  restored, and though it is doubtless still necessary  to avoid any measures which would be  calculated to alarm businessopinion either  in  Great Britain or abroad,  there  is no longer  any substantialreason to  fear  that our economic equilibrium  may be deranged by  unreasoningwaves of foreign distrust.  It is true that sterling has at the moment entered ona phase of weakness which we expect to continue for a little time to come.   Thepresent weakness is, however, an essentially different phenomenon from that which prevailed a year ago.    21.  The present position of sterling is, in our judgment, dominated by theuncertain situation which  exists  as  we  write  in regard  to war debts, andparticularly  in regard to the instalment of the British debt to the United states which  falls  to be  paid in  December.  If, for example, it  were shortly  to be announced that an arrangement had been  made between the  United States and her debtors providing for a suspension of the December  payments, pending apermanent revision of the debt settlements, we should expect to see a substantialrecovery of  sterling for this reason alone.   If, on the other hand, it were to be announced that the British Government had decided to pay the December instal-ment  since no  amicable arrangement  could be made for suspension, a furtherdecline in sterling would be very probable.  It is difficult to assess the consequences of a postponement of payment on  the responsibility of  Great Britain.  But  weare decidedly of the opinion that to acquiesce in a refusal of postponement bythe United  States  would  be injurious, on  a balance of considerations economicand political, both to the immediate economic prospects of this country  and ofthe world as a whole and also to an ultimate satisfactory settlement of the debtquestion.  Whilst the obvious  reasons for satisfying our bond to the letter arecogent, we believe that,  in present circumstances and in view of the whole historyof the matter,  financial circles in the United States would regard a sustainedobjection on our part to pay with sympathy and even with welcome; while publicopinion in this country, outside financial circles, may well develop,  according tothe character of the negotiations, into sharing European opinion and regardingpayment on the 15th December as an act of weakness rather than of strength.    22.  Apart from this dominating influence, the present weakness of sterlingis attributable  partly to the normal seasonal tendency and partly to  the effects ofthe conversion scheme.  The low rate of interest which has been established inLondon as  the result  of  the  conversion scheme has naturally  given  rise to atendency on the part of some investors to purchase securities in other markets,particularly in New York, where more attractive yields can be obtained.   this tendency is one which we anticipated in our  fourth report in commenting on  the conversion scheme, and it has not as yet assumed dimensions any larger than it then seemed natural to  expect.  It must necessarily be a matter of doubt whetherit&apos; will be possible for  long to maintain rates of interest as low as those now established  in  London.   But a moderate further  fall in the  exchanges, coupled with a moderate fall in  the prices of British securities, would probably suffice
i 0s)1 to reverse the capital movement.  There is, therefore, no danger to-day, in our judgment, that sterling might undergo a cumulative and uncontrolled decline.    23.  In this connection, we think it well to comment on one matter which may otherwise give rise to uneasiness in  the near future.    We  think it not unlikely that when the  computations of the British balance of payments for  1932 are comjDleted, the  results,  though showing considerable improvement on  those for 1931, will, none the less, leave a substantial adverse balance.   For although the improvement in the present year in the commodity balance of trade may be com- mensurate with the adverse balance of payments for 1931, we must reckon with aconsiderable  further decline in our  invisible receipts  under such headings as foreign investment income and shipping freights.   It is important, therefore, to appreciate that there is no such close  and simple relation between the British balance of trade  and the strength of sterling in the exchange markets that iscommonly supposed.  In so far as Britain develops an adverse  balance of trade as the result of imports from countries like India,  Australia and New Zealand,it is probable that no immediate strain is  cast on the sterling exchanges.   It istrue that such imports tend to make sterling weaker relatively to such currenciesas the-Indian rupee or the Australian pound, i.e., they strengthen these currenciesrelatively  to sterling;  but this is not what is ordinarily meant by a  weakness of sterling.   On  the contrary, a strengthening  of the Indian rupee or theAustralian pound  would make for  a strengthening of the British financial system as a whole.   What we  ordinarily have in mind  in  considering the strength orweakness of sterling is the exchange value of the pound in terms  of gold standardcurrencies, notably the dollar and the franc.  Upon  this the British balance ofpayments  has only a comparatively  slight bearing :  a more important factoris the balance  of  payments between France, the United States and  countriesassociated with them on the one hand, and the rest of the world on  the  other.While it is very difficult to give precise  figures, it is fairly clear that the balanceof payments of the gold standard  countries has deteriorated steadily during thecourse of the present depression.
                   III. Trade activity and financial policy.     24.   To sum up our observations on sterling : we think that the future course of the exchanges must be regarded as a matter of great uncertainty, so long as the question of the December debt payment to the United States remains unsettled. But there is nothing in the exchange position to give grounds for any fundamental uneasiness.  No sufficient reason remains for permitting exchange considerations to dominate our internal financial policy.   Indeed,  in the stage which we have now reached, minor modifications of our internal financial policy, which are not calculated to prejudice the psychological situation, would not exert any important influence on the exchanges.     25.   On the other hand, our financial policy may exert in various ways an important influence on the state of trade activity.   v7e think, therefore, that the- time has come when certain aspects of our financial policy should  be reviewed in the light of their bearing on the trade situation to-day.     26.  The financial policy adopted  last year in  response  to the widespread distrust of the British position had three main aspects, which it is important from the standpoint of our present argument to distinguish from one another.   In the first place, it entailed the principle of a balanced budget, i.e.,  the raising of revenue sufficient to defray all government  expenditure, and  the  application of this principle to include expenditure on items such as unemployment benefit, and roads, which  our previous financial arrangements  had permitted  to be met by borrowing.   Secondly, it entailed a curtailment of programmes of  public works,. undertaken by the  municipalities but stimulated and subsidised by the central government,  the expenditure on which is met by borrowing,  but which throws a  burden  on  the  local  and  national  budgets of  future years.   Thirdly,  it entailed reductions in current expenditure, cuts in unemployment benefit, in  the pay of teachers, police, the fighting services, &amp;c, designed to diminish the amount of taxation which it is necessary to raise in order to cover expenditure.    27.  The last of these features of our present financial policy gives rise to no question relevant to the activity of trade.  In so far as the state pays out smaller sums by way of wages, salaries and benefits,  but, on the other hand, takes away correspondingly smaller sums from the public by way  of taxation, there is no net reduction in the aggregate  purchasing power of the community,  and no clear presumption  that trade will be affected on balance  in one  direction rather than the other,  provided that those who are relieved are as ready, and as able, to spend as those who  suffer the cuts. The other two features of our financial policy raise, however, different considerations.                              (a) Public works.    28.  The curtailment  of public works  programmes  which  are normally financed by means of loan involves a diminution in the sums paid out by  public authorities without  any corresponding diminution in the sums extracted from  the public in the form of taxation.   Except,  therefore, in so far as it  stimulates  the undertaking of capital enterprises by ordinary industry, the curtailment of public works  programmes  serves to diminish the aggregate purchasing power of  the community, and has an influence prejudicial to trade activity.  It  is possible that the curtailment of  public  works programmes during the  last year may have contributed something to the establishment of the lower interest rates Avhich now prevail, and, theoretically no doubt, lower interest rates should tend to encourage capital expenditure by  industrial firms and by the  public generally.   Thisencouragement by  itself,  however, is insufficient under  present conditions to stimulate capital expenditure on any considerable scale.  Business men can hardly be expected to venture substantial sums  of money on new plant merely because they can borrow the money for the purpose cheaply, so  long as trade conditions are as unprofitable  as they are to-day.  Until, therefore, some  means is found of increasing  the volume of purchases by the consuming public, industry is unlikely to be stimulated to capital expenditure on any appreciable scale by lower interest rates.   Moreover,  even if  this difficulty  could be  overcome,  the amount which industry would be likely to expend on fixed capital would probably be of amuch smaller magnitude than  that involved  in the  reduction of  public  worksprogrammes.
     29.  Moreover, even if it be allowed that the curtailment of public works has played an appreciable part in the past year in establishing lower rates of interest,its utility for this purpose must now be regarded as exhausted.  We have already established a disparity between the rates of interest prevailing  in  London  andthose prevailing in other centres  at least as great as we can hope to sustain.  Inthese circumstances, we cannot hope to push the  rate of interest still lower bycurtailing public works programmes still further.  Conversely, there is no reasonto suppose that a relaxation of the  policy of  slowing down public works would react materially  on  interest rates at the present time.   Thus, under  present-conditions, there are no compensating advantages to trade and employment to set against the disadvantages of the policy of curtailment.     30.  The question of public works raises, however, other issues of a contro-versial character.  In so far as  they are not financially remunerative they throw a burden on the future budgets of the state and the  local authorities.  Throughoutthe post-war period the policy  of pushing forward public works schemes in theinterests of  employment has been pursued  on so  large a scale that the annualburden which falls to-day on  the national  and local budgets in respect  of thepublic works of preceding years is already substantial.  Widespread misgivingshave accordingly been aroused  as to the financial  soundness of a practice whichthus  entails  a  cumulative   increase in  budgetary burdens;  and  many  localauthorities, which include those districts in which  unemployment  is most serious,are to-day in a financial position  in which they cannot prudently afford to incurfurther liabilities for  the future.  Moreover, the large amount  of  public work that has  been done in the post-war period has necessarily  served to diminish the opportunities  remaining  for  schemes  possessing  a high degree  of financialremunerativeness or  quasi-commercial utility.  We differ among ourselves as tothe precise weight which should be attached to these considerations at the present justice.     31.  We are agreed that a  point has now been reached when it is undesirable to discourage,  on general financial grounds,  local authorities whose financialsecurity  is not  in question from undertaking work which they themselves desireto undertake without any subsidy from the Exchequer.  We are further  agreedthat it is undesirable under present conditions to seek to hold up the completionof public works on which a large amount of money has already been spent,  andthe ultimate completion of which is clearly desirable.  Work that  must,  in anycase, be done one day should not be slowed down now.  We regard it as important that these principles  should be  observed, particularly in view  of the  reports which we understand will shortly be published, urging fresh economy in  local expenditure.   Apart from  works undertaken by public  authorities, there are various schemes of industrial development, such as railway electrification and thehydrogenation  of coal, which  raise some question of government  assistance force  -operation. The fall in  the rate of interest should make an important difference to the economic  feasibility  of  such  projects,  and we are of opinion that  it isdesirable that they should now be re-examined with this point in mind.   where such schemes approximate to the  character of economic propositions, we  regard it as desirable  that they should be pressed forward.                         (b) Budgetary  equilibrium.     32.  We pass to the first of the three aspects of our present financial policy,that, namely,   of the  balanced budget.   The question  is one of  considerable-delicacy  in view of the history  of the past few years. The impression arising in1931 from the publication of the May report of an  enormous and rapidly-growingbudget deficit was an important  contributory cause of the distrust of sterling^The psychological conventions that go  to make up general  confidence are stillattached to the maintenance of the principle  of budgetary equilibrium, without reference to underlying economic issues  involved.     33.  There are, however,  good  grounds in our judgment for reconsideringthe  manner  in  which this principle  has been  applied.   The  revenue  andexpenditure of  the modern state account for so large a proportion of the national income that the  balance between  what  the  state draws in on the one hand andpays out on the other is necessarily an important  factor  in determining the
aggregate purchasing power of the consuming public.  For the state to draw inmore than has been customary by means of taxation, and to pay out less than hasbeen customary in expenditure, is necessarily a deflationary influence, adverse totrade activity; and, though considerations of confidence may at  times compelrecourse to such a policy, it should not be carried further in a time  of depressionthan considerations of confidence really justify.                    (c)  Unemployment insurance finance.    34.  A very  important item in our present public expenditure is unemploy-ment benefit.  It would be natural  to expect, as one of the advantages of havingplaced unemployment relief on an insurance basis, with  a fund separate fromthe ordinary Exchequer, that the fluctuations of unemployment expenditure wouldprovide an automatic and legitimate corrective to the ups and downs of trade.If,  as  was  the original  idea, the  unemployment insurance  fund accumulatedreserves in years when unemployment was comparatively low, and dissipated themin years when it was exceptionally  high, a useful set-off would be provided to thedecline in purchasing-power arising from a depression, which would help, whenother influences were favourable, to promote recovery. Unfortunately, the historyof the unemployment insurance fund has been such that it has tended to produce the opposite result.  Under the influence of over-optimistic ideas as to the future course of unemployment, its finances were so arranged that its expenditure tended to exceed its revenue during the years of good world trade.    When the worlddepression  began, accordingly,  the unemployment insurance  fund, so far from having accumulated reserves, was already loaded with a substantial debt.  In theearly phases of the depression; this debt grew rapidly, and eventually exceeded 100 millions.  The spectacle of  this  growing debt contributed largely to theimpression of radical financial unsoundness which  prevailed in the summer of1931.  Accordingly, an  integral   feature of the financial policy  subsequentlypursued was the  cessation  of borrowing by the  unemployment insurance  fund.Thus, we are now endeavouring to defray out of current revenue at the bottom of a depression of unprecedented severity the whole expenditure on relieving avolume of unemployment which now approaches 3 millions.  Expenditure on suchessentially  capital purposes as  new road construction and the building of newEmployment Exchanges is  also being defrayed out of revenue, an arrangement which entails the  postponement under present financial conditions of work whichis urgently required.  At the same time, the national budget includes a substantialprovision for the sinking fund.    35.  This is to go further than in our judgment is required by considerations.of sound finance or by considerations of maintaining confidence.  No  other countryattempts to-day  to balance its budget in the same strict sense  that we  areattempting.  Every other country makes provision for borrowing to meet various forms of expenditure which are regarded as abnormal.  Whatever  the course ofemployment  in the immediate future  may prove  to be, it  may  be taken as-reasonably  certain that unemployment  will fall in due course to a substancially lower level than prevails to-day, and we  ought not, in our judgment, to be deterredby the past history of  unjustifiably optimistic estimates  to refrain from acting-on this assumption. The present difficulties of the world are aggravated in various ways by the disposition of governments  of many countries, in their anxiety toavoid the repetition of past and proven mistakes, to rush in to no  less seriousmistakes of  an opposite character.   To  insist under  present conditions  oncontinuing to defray from current  taxation the whole of our expenditure on ourpresent unemployment, would be an excess of austerity, for which  past excessesof extravagance provide no adequate justification.    36.  An opportunity for reconsidering our  financial policy in this respectarises in view of the  publication of the report of the Royal Commission  onUnemployment Insurance,  and of the reconstruction of the insurance system which will  presumably follow.  We think it desirable that an  integral feature ofany such reconstruction should be to secure a balancing of revenue and expenditureon the basis  of an unemployment figure high by the standards of  the past,  butsubstantially lower than that prevailing to-day, and to permit a  renewal of borrowing  for excess expenditure during the remainder of the depression.   Wedo not believe that the adoption of such  a policy would serve to weaken confidence:
in the soundness of our national finances, while, on the other hand, it would beof material assistance to the trade position.   Views very  similar to these are expressed by Mr. Henry Clay in a note appended by him to the report of the RoyalCommission.                            (d)  The sinking fund.    37.  For similar reasons, we are of opinion that it is inexpedient to maintain a substantial sinking fund in the budget at the present time.  The sinking fundmeans that the state is abstracting more than it is spending from the incomes ofthe public; and this  serves necessarily  to  check the volume  of consumption and consequently of trade activity.  In this way it may serve rather to weakenthan to strengthen confidence. We are satisfied that if by suspending the sinkingfund, in whole or in part, it became possible to reduce taxation in the next budget,the psychological, as well as the directly economic, results would be advantageous,particularly if the reduction took a form calculated to encourage development and enterprise.   The  rise in  the price of government  securities has  entailed an automatic suspension of the contractual sinking fund requirements, which Avouldsupply additional  justification for a modification  of sinking fund policy.   Thecase for such a modification becomes still stronger, if  a renewal of borrowing forthe unemployment insurance  fund is regarded as impracticable.  We think it is-also desirable that arrangements should be made to permit borrowing for purposesof a  capital character  so that urgently needed work  which would be helpful  tothe industrial situation should not be postponed merely on account of  budgetaryexigencies.                         (e)  Concluding  observations.    38.  In making the above suggestions, we are affected  by the consideration that,  in order to secure a trade improvement, it is  important that as many  aspossible of  the  influences  on which trade activity depends should be workingsimultaneously in  the direction of recovery.  It is of little use, for example, forthe state to endeavour to stimulate trade by public works or  in other ways, if the prevailing monetary conditions  are such as to necessitate a restricted  volume  of credit.  Conversely, easy  money conditions  are  apt  to be  ineffective if  otherinfluences such as the  state of business confidence or the financial policy of thestate  are adverse to trade activity.  We have now reached a stage when many  ofthe conditions on which  recovery  depends have been established; easy moneyconditions prevail in the chief financial centres, the essentials of internal financialconfidence have been restored, the supplies of stocks in the  principal commoditymarkets are consistent with recovery.  The most important condition which is stilllacking is an easing of the difficulties of international trade and an improvementin the sphere  of international financial relations.   But so far as Great britain is concerned, we are of opinion  that some modification  of  our  present  internalfinancial policy will also be required.[7858]n
                          IY. Private  spending.    39.  A further question seems to  us worthy  of consideration in thisconnection.   The actions of the members of the public in their capacity  asconsumers represent a factor of great importance.  It is only when the consumingpublic begins  to increase its purchases that we can  hope  for  a genuine traderecovery.  With this consideration  in mind,  appeals have often been addressedto the public for &apos;&apos; wise spending &apos;&apos; in the interests of trade and employment. Thediscussion which such appeals are arousing in the press at the present moment isan indication of the influence which they might exert if they were cast in a formand backed by an authority which carried  conviction.  At present they encountercertain obvious resistances in the minds of  the great majority of  people,  who withdiminished incomes and a fear that their  incomes may be diminished further inthe near future, cannot  reconcile the idea of spending  freely  on miscellaneousitems of current expenditure with deep-seated feelings of wise conduct.    40.  It is possible, however, that such appeals might be given a  form and a direction which would overcome  this difficulty.  It is possible, for example, thata considerable response might be secured if the appeals were concentrated  on expenditure of a durable nature,  such as,  for example, domestic equipment andthe reconditioning of property.  The question of an organised national appeal for expenditure of a character calculated to be of enduring benefit to the individualsundertaking it, and accompanied if  possible by arrangements with the industrieschiefly concerned for specially reduced prices, seems to us worthy of examination.Possible  lines on which  such an appeal  might  be based are elaborated in  anindependent memorandum which has been submitted  to  us and which  we think of sufficient interest to attach as  an appendix to our  report.  Inasmuch  as suchan appeal would  require a considerable period of preparation, we suggest thatthe possibility is one which might advantageously be explored without delay.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     November 22, 1932.
APPENDIX.             Unemployment and consumers&apos; capital expenditure.    FROM  time to  time  during the last year appeals have been made to the-public for &quot;wise spending&quot; in the interest of trade  and employment.  Theseappeals doubtless exert  a  useful influence, but  their effect cannot be very greatso long as they are couched in general terms.    2.  Appeals of  this character  encounter certain obvious resistances in the minds of the great majority of people.  In the first place, most people have eitheralready had their incomes diminished or fear  that they may be diminished inthe near future.   Traditional prudence enjoins in these circumstances a retrench-ment rather than an expansion of current personal expenditure, and the majorityof people, even if they could be  intellectually convinced that it was in the publicinterest that the public should spend more freely  than usual, would none theless feel  that  in  their particular case it was not the right  thing to do.   Butit is difficult to  secure genuine acceptance for such a proposition in  the mind&apos;of the ordinary  man.  He may listen to arguments that increased spending is what  is needed,  and may  not be able to find an answer to them.   He may evengo so  far as to give some sort of verbal assent, but he will not be really convinced.He will retain a feeling that the course suggested is in conflict with  the wisdom of the ages, and must be  fundamentally wrong.  Deep down everyone believes that thrift is a virtue, not only for the individual,  but for the community as awhole, and no-one really believes deep clown that a short road out of difficult timescan be found merely by  throwing thrift to the winds.  No appeal which impliesa denial of  the  value of thrift can carry real conviction or  secure  an effectiveresponse.    3.  None  the less,  it remains true  that  the  maintenance  of consumers&quot;demand is essential if trade and employment are not to deteriorate further, andthat it is only if the improvement in commodity prices is followed by increasedpurchases by the consuming public that we can hope  for a genuine trade recovery.It is further true that the British public are in a mood of unusual readiness to respond  to a patriotic call.  This  is shown by the impression produced by the&apos;&apos; Buy British &quot; campaign a year ago, by the manner in which well-to-do personslast winter obeyed the exhortation to abstain from foreign holidays,  and  more recently  by the response to the conversion appeal.  The nation-wide appeal for public-spirited action is in these days an instrument  of great potential power.    4.  The question arises, therefore, whether appeals for wise spending  couldbe given a form and a direction which would reconcile them with  deep-seatedfeelings  of wise conduct.  It is suggested that this  might be done if the appealswere  concentrated on expenditure  of a capital nature.  It  is one thing for an individual, with a diminished income and an uncertain future,  to spend moneyfreely on miscellaneous items of current expenditure.   By so doing, he will beapt to form tastes  which he may  not be able  to continue to gratify, or habitswhich it is always difficult to break.  In so far as it is  a question of encouraging the members of his  family to spend freely, the risk  of stimulating inappropriatetastes and habits will appear even greater.  It is another thing to lay out a sumof money, in the spirit of investment, on a purpose which  wall be of enduringbenefit, and which  may even,  perhaps, make possible  a diminution of annual expenditure in future years.  There are many forms of individual  expenditure which are essentially analogous to  the putting in by an industrial firm of more efficient  machinery  or  labour-saving plant.  That is the  type  of individualexpenditure which  on economic grounds it  is most  desirable to encourage now,and  it  is the  type of  expenditure  which, it  is suggested,  prudent-mindedindividuals  could most readily be induced to undertake in response to a patrioticappeal.    5.   The most promising example of this type of expenditure is domesticequipment.   It  is common knowledge that in the United States, where incomesare normally higher than  here, but where domestic  service is scarce,  the running of a  house has  been simplified by  the introduction of  all sorts of labour-saving       [7858]                                                       E
appliances.   Similar appliances are being introduced in Great Britain, but verygradually.   The progressive extension of their use represents a virtually certaindevelopment of the next ten years.  It would  greatly assist our recovery fromthe present depression  if this development could be speeded up.   In  the last decade it used to be argued with reference to public works that  it was desirableto press forward  in a period of abnormal unemployment with those works whichwould probably be undertaken in any case over the next ten years.  The argumentwas sound in principle, though it was applied at a time when trade, as  we nowsee. was not abnormally bad, with the unfortunate result that  the possibilitiesof anticipating genuinely needed public  works have  been largely exhausted.Exactly the same argument holds good of the capital outlay of individuals : thepossibilities under this head have not been exhausted, and there  can be no doubt.as to the reality of the present depression.    6.  The domestic  improvements which it would  be appropriate  for theindividual to adopt would depend, of course, upon his income and his  scale ofliving.   Persons  of considerable means might instal central heating and servicelifts,  equip  their  bedrooms  with wash-basins  with  running water,  or  buyrefrigerators.  Persons of smaller means might replace old-fashioned  kitchenranges with ideal boilers and gas or electric cooking, replace old-fashioned grateswith slow-combustion grates,  and purchase such appliances as vacuum-cleaners,washing-machines and electric irons.  These examples could easily be multiplied.The point which  it is important to appreciate is that in almost every household,above the lowest  ranges of income, there will be some domestic improvement, notyet introduced,  but  representing a perfectly  appropriate expenditure, some improvement which would  fairly be justified  as a  measure of true economy.Vacuum-cleaners, for example, are not&quot; as yet possessed by nearly all who mightadvantageously possess  them; and, going still  further down in the income-scale,the same probably holds true of such an old-fashioned domestic appliance as the-sewing-machine.    7.  Apart from  the introduction of new  improvements, there is in manyhouseholds  a strong case  of maintaining existing capital assets in proper-condition.   Many house-owners, for example, would be well advised to paint andpoint the outsides of their  houses, and to effect many  repairs which they haveneglected too long.    8.   It  is  suggested, therefore,  that there  are great  possibilities in an authoritative appeal to  the  public to improve the equipment of their homes.  Ifsuch an appeal  were organised  by  the government, with the aid  of intensivepublicity, and if the co-operation of persons of good-will and influence throughoutthe community were enlisted,  a widespread  and  substantial  response wouldprobably be  secured.   The  concentration  of the  appeal on domestic equipment would ensure an active discussion of the subject  in every household.   Largenumbers of people would probably be able  to gratify their  natural desire to &apos;* do their  bit &quot; by introducing improvements  which they had  vaguely  contemplatedmaking for some  time past.    9.   It might further be desirable that the appeal should be accompanied by special arrangements for financial facilities for those who would like to respond,but who could not do so out of income.  Many  of the appliances in question canalready be obtained on  the hire purchase system, but it might be possible and desirable to enlist the co-operation of the building societies and banks, who might agree to make advances to customers, with whom they had already  had dealings,for expenditure on domestic equipment up to a moderate sum.     10.   In connection  with  the appeal,  arrangements might be made  with theindustries which would be likely to be most directly benefited.   If the publicresponse to  the  appeal  were very large,  there is  a possibility that the manu-facturers of certain commodities might be almost overwhelmed by  the increased demand for their  products,  and might be tempted to take advantage of  thesituation by raising  their  selling prices.   It should be  possible  to safeguard against  this danger by obtaining  assurances from the  manufacturers mostconcerned that they would not raise their prices.  In some cases, indeed,  it mightbe possible to  secure offers of specially reduced prices for a limited period  inconsideration of the prospective increase in the volume of sales.
    11.  The suggested appeal would represent an entirely appropriate develop-ment  in  the technique of the economic organisation  of  the modern democraticcommunity.  A great amount of attention has been given in recent years to theorganisation of production.   The state steps in increasingly to urge this or that industry to rationalise  itself  and  to  adjust its  productive capacity to theconditions  of  demand.  No similar attention has  as  yet  been paid to theorganisation of consiunption.   None the less, it is the consumer who determinesthe amount that can profitably be  produced by each particular industry, and solong as we retain a money economy, it is the consumer who will continue todetermine this.   The consumer cannot be coerced, but he can be led.   Indeed,the vast expenditure on modern  advertising  is  a testimony  to the  fact thatindividuals are far more easily influenced in their capacity as consumers than intheir  capacity  as producers.  Hitherto  we have  left  the  influencing of theconsumer entirely to private  enterprise interested  in  the  sale of  particularproducts.  This means that public policy is  failing to use one of  the maininstruments that lie ready to its hand for securing a balanced national economy.The time has come when some of the attention hitherto given to the organisation^f production might profitably be given to the direction of consumption.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     November 14, 1932.o
