A difference exists as to  the  provision to be made in the  Indian Constitutionagainst commercial  discrimination,  and  it  is  now  necessary  for  me  to  ask mycolleagues for  a Cabinet decision, as  the matter  will  come up for  discussion inthe Indian  Round Table  Conference  almost  immediately.   After  discussion  hadtaken place in the Cabinet India Committee the case was- considered  by the Inter-Departmental  Committee  on  Inter-Imperial Relations, whose Report I attach.   Thetwo alternative clauses are set out in  the Report and the opposing views are urged inthe two Memoranda attached to  the  Report, the first of which  represents the viewof the Colonial Office, Dominions  Office, Foreign Office and Board  of Trade, and thesecond the view of myself, my Department, Sir Claud Schuster and Sir Maurice Gwyer.   The Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial  Relations was discussed in the Cabinet India Committee on Thursda.y, the 1st  December, when theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs presented  his views and  those  of theDepartments associated  with him in this matter.  On that occasion the  Secretary ofState for  War made the suggestion that a compromise might  be sought  on thefollowing lines, namely, that no  British  subject shall be subjected in India to any form of  discrimination so long as no discrimination of any hind is enforced  againstIndian subjects of His Majesty in that part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions  in which suchBritish subject is domiciled.  This  suggestion has  since been  examined  by the experts, who take the vieAv that it might not be impossible to find some trivial instanceof Indians being ineligible in this country for some particular appointment or  activitywhich could be used to destroy  the protection which  it is so necessary to secure forBritish concerns in  India.  They advise, therefore, that  the  risk of  adopting thissuggestion is too great, and I fear that their advice must be accepted.   In that  case, we have, as far as I  can  see. no option but to make a direct choice between the two alternative clauses set out in the Report  of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on Inter-Imperial  Relations,  and I strongly press upon the considerationof my colleagues  the arguments  set  forth in  the second  memorandum  attached tothe Report.  We  shall, of course, have in any case  to provide against commercialdiscrimination  in the  Indian Constitution.  But in the application of any provision that we make a great deal will  depend upon whether  or not we  secure a measure ofIndian consent and approval for it.  If it is enacted against the weight of indian opinion, it is likely to engender friction which will diminish the value of the protectionprovided.   For alternative (2)  we hope to secure a  substantial measure of Indiansupport;  but  I feel sure that  there  will  be  unanimous Indian opposition to alter-native (1).  The material interests which we have to protect in India  are of enormous.value and importance.   It is my considered opinion that if we accept the proposal ofthe Foreign Office, the Dominions Office, the  Colonial  Office  and  the  Board of Trade,we shall  be gravely prejudicing the immense  substance of British trade  in India for a constitutional  theory that, however  much we may  wish  to  support  it in  normal circumstances, will in this case  undoubtedly prejudice  the whole of politically-mindedIndia against us.   I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will  accept  the contentions set out in thesecond of the two memoranda.9th December 1932.S. H.1510    60  12.32
Eeport of the Inter-Departmental  Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations  on certain     questions raised in connection with the Treatment of British Subjects in India.   The Committee was asked to consider certain questions  raised by the proposedwording of a draft which had been prepared for examination in connection  with theconsideration of a  new Constitution for India.   The clause, which was in alternative form, is as follows :                                  Alternative  (1).       No British subject to be subjected by any Federal or Provincial law to any     (disability or) discrimination which would not by  law be  imposed upon,  or     enforced against, an Indian subject of His  Majesty in that part of His Majesty&apos;s     Dominions in  which such British subject is domiciled in  respect of the holding of     property, movable or immovable, the carrying  on  of any profession,  trade or     business in or with British India or in respect of entry into, residence or travel     in any part of British India.                                 Alternative  (2).       No British subject domiciled in the United Kingdom (and no European British     subject domiciled in India) to be subjected by any Federal or Provincial law  to     any (disability or) discrimination which would not by law be imposed  upon or     enforced against an Indian subject  of His  Majesty  in the  United Kingdom in     respect of the holding  of property, movable  or  immovable, the  carrying on of     any profession, trade or business in or with British India, or in respect  of  entry     into, residence or travel in any part of British India.   The Committee  agreed,  on  examination of the  position  as  explained  bySir C. Schuster, Sir M. Gwyer and  Sir L. Kershaw, that  there were  in the  present case facts  which rendered it impossible to recommend the retentiou of the establishedprinciple,  in connection with  commercial treaties with  foreign countries, that thereshould be no discrimination between  different  classes of British subjects, in spite ofthe difficulty which they all admitted this would be likely to cause in connection withthe maintenance of this principle in future  in  regard to commercial treaties.  TheCommittee was unable, however, to reach agreement as to the manner in which suchdiscrimination might  be accepted.   The Dominions Office and  Colonial Office repre-sentatives were prepared to accept the clause in the shape of  alternative (1) but  were unwilling  to accept alternative (2).   Sir Claud Schuster, Sir Maurice Gwyer, and the representatives of the India  Officepressed for the acceptance  of alternative (2),  and took  the  view that there was no possibility of securing acceptance for alternative (1).   It was agreed  that the  conflicting views should  be set  out  in the form of two memoranda.  The views of the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office, which areendorsed  generally by the  Foreign  Office and the Board of  Trade, are set out  in memorandum I attached, and  the opposing views are  set out in Memorandum II.                                       Signed on behalf of  the Committee,     FOREIGN OFFICE,                                         GEORGE  MOUNSEY.   11th November  1932.                              MEMORANDUM I.   1. At  past Imperial Conferences when questions connected with the negotiation of treaties have been under discussion, representatives of the United Kingdom have laid  great stress  upon the principle of co-operation between  the  Members of theBritish Commonwealth, with  its corollary that any  Member of the  Commonwealth.in negotiating a  treaty should do its  utmost  to study,  not only its own interests,but  those of all the  other Members, and this  principle may be  regarded as havingbeen accepted  by the representatives of  most of the Dominions.   This principle wasreaffirmed at the Imperial Conference of 1930  in  the following terms (see Cmd. 3717of 1930, page 28) :-       ;&apos; Any of His  Majesty&apos;s Governments conducting negotiations should inform     the other Governments of His Majesty in case they should be interested and give     them the opportunity of  expressing their views,  if they think that their interests     may be affected.&quot;   Literally, this refers  to  negotiations with foreign  coxmtries, but the  principle would seem equally applicable to cases such as  the present.
                                                                                  1 Vfl                                                                                  - a v/                                        y   2. The principle was further developed in  an unpublished Memorandum in which.the Dominions other than  the Irish bYee State concurred.  This Memorandum dealsexpressly with  the inclusion of  all British subjects wherever domiciled when treatyrights  are  being secured.   Admittedly, the  question of a provision in the indian constitution of  the nature now under consideration  does not come within the letter&apos;ofthe recommendations of the Imperial Conferences  relating to  the negotiation of atreaty with a foreign country, but  there  seems little doubt that some, at anj- rate, ofthe Dominions would feel that, in a matter which is within the control of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United  Kingdom, a similar principle to that just described shouldbe followed  and that they would  regard it as inconsistent with such a principle  andthe whole spirit of the Imperial Conference resolutions if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United  Kingdom, while taking steps  to secure benefits in India for Britishsubjects domiciled  in the United  Kingdom, on condition of reciprocal treatment forIndians in  the United Kingdom, were  to make no  endeavour at all to  secure corre-sponding benefits for British subjects domiciled in  the Dominions.   If His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were to rest content  with  attempting to obtain no more than the secondform  of alternative  clause, which refers only to British  subjects domiciled  in  theUnited  Kingdom  and  excludes  any  mention  of  British  subjects  domiciled inthe Dominions, their action would, it is  thought, be justly open  to criticism on this ground, especially as Canada has  recently given practical effect to the principle inthe important  treaty concluded  with  the Dinted  States as to the St. Lawrence, whererights are secured for all British ships and not merely for Canadian vessels.   3. It may be argued  that in practice the  second alternative would  impose no serious  disability on the Dominions, since it leaves  it open to any Dominion Goveru-ment to negotiate with India a similar arrangement  on behalf of its &quot;nationals&quot; and accordingly that there is in effect no practical  difference between the two alternatives.There would be one difference in principle in  that the provision relating  to the UnitedKingdom would have the sanction of an Act of Parliament.   Moreover, the suggestionthat Dominions could  negotiate their  own arrangements  would  hardly dispel  theappearance of neglect of the interests of the Dominions to which the adoption of  this alternative might give rise.  Further, a  Dominion Government might contend that ifthis  argument is sound. His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the  United Kingdom mightthemselves  have pursued the same policy with regard to British subjects domiciled inthe United  Kingdom.   4. Further, if this  second alternative is  adopted, there is  no guarantee that a dominion by separate negotiation  will be able to secure the same rights as are securedto the  United Kingdom under  the clause, since it is more than  probable  that india would insist, in return for granting such rights, on some further concession on thepart  of the Dominion concerned, e.g.  in regard  to franchise rights which are not-covered by this clause in either of its two forms.    5. It is true that the first alternative (and indeed the second  alternative also)  does not in terms provide for strict  reciprocity, since, while providing that,  if any part of the  Empire in fact accords  certain benefits to Indians, India is bouud  to accord corresponding treatment to British subjects  domiciled in  that part of the Empire,  it does not ensure  that  if  India, in fact, accords certain  benefits to British subjects domiciled  in  a particular part of the  Empire, that part of the Empire is bound to accord corresponding  treatment to  Indians.  It  should  be  pointed  out  in  this connection that India, like other  parts of  the British Empire, has in fact, benefited in the  past from partially reciprocal  clauses in commercial treaties concluded by the United Kingdom of precisely this kind. Moreover,  if the partially reciprocal character of the provision is objectionable,  tho objection  applies just   as  strongly  to the alternative version No. 2.    C. Further, the  limitation involved in the first alternative cannot be regarded as unreasonable  in itself, seeing  that  the clause  in terms provides that the treatment accorded in India to any British subject is to be dependent on the treatment accorded to Indians in  the part  of  the Empire  in which that British subject is domiciled, and should therefore meet  the desire  of India to retaliate against Dominions or Colonies which restrict the rights of Indians.     7.  In the circumstances it would uppear that, if the second alternative is adopted, -there may  well be strong  criticisms on  the part of Dominions and that  good  grounds
can  be urged  for suck  criticisms.&apos;  The  disadvantages of  such  a  position  are-twofold :        (.1) It is most desirable that any new regime in India  should be  instituted, as     far as possible, with the frill support and goodwill of the Dominions, especially in     view of the influence which iu future the Dominions might be able to bring to bear     upon relations between Great Britain  and India.  From this  point  of view, it is     important  not to antagonise  the Dominions by any procedure  which might be     regarded  as establishing  a special regime as between  this country and India     from which they themselves would be  excluded.       (2) It is very desirable, from the point  of view of the United Kingdom, that     Dominion  Governments,  in any negotiations which they may conduct, should     observe the principle already  referred  to of securing benefits  for other members     of the Commonwealth and not only for themselves (see, for example, paragraph 1     as  to the  recent Canadian action),  it will  be very difficult for IIis Majesty&apos;s   .  Government iu the United Kingdom to press this  course upon the Dominions if     Dominion Governments can point to  a case where, in a matter  under the control     of His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the United Kingdom, it has not, been followed.   S. Further, from a general point of view, there is little doubt that, notwithstanding the difference  in kind between the two cases, what  is done in the case of India in thismatter of personal rights  in  commerce will  be regarded as a precedent by foreigncountries who may in future negotiate commercial treaties with this country.  While,therefore, it is agreed, as  stated  above, that  in the present  case it is impossible to-insist on the principle that  there  should be no discrimination at all between Britishsubjects, it is most important, from the point of view of reactions on foreign countries,not  to depart further from the principle  than can  possibly be  avoided,  and thisfurnishes a strong argument for adopting the first,  rather than the second, alternative.   9. The second alternative  involves a clear sub-division of British  subjects intocategories.  The first alternative, though  in  effect differentiating  between differentcategories, in  form draws no  such &quot;distinction, but makes the discrimination dependon the law of the part of the Empire to which a British subject belongs.   10. The  position of the Colonies requires further  consideration.   It should not be overlooked that His Majesty&apos;s  Government are  in a position of direct responsibility inrelatiou to the interests of British  subjects  domiciled in the Colonies, Protectorates and mandated Territories.  While obviously  these interests arc  inconsiderable  in com-parison with the United Kingdom interests involved, there are nevertheless importantColonial trading interests in  India, and it is  urged that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould not be discharging their responsibilities if  no steps were taken to protect suchinterests.   1.1. For  such purposes  the United Kingdom and the Dependencies  are  normallyregarded as a political  unit within, the British Commonwealth, and it. is  important that nothing  should  be done  unnecessarily to imply a  disregard  for this  essentialunity.   In  particular, it  may  be pointed out that  while,  in  the last  resort, theDominions might  be left to make their own  terms with India,  any negotiations with india  in  relation  to any Dependency would have  to  be conducted by  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in  the  United Kingdom.   If  therefore no steps are  taken  at the  outsetto link the  interests of the Dependencies with those of the United  Kingdom, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would  have placed  itself in an incomparably weaker positionin which to  conduct any further negotiations on behalf of any of the Dependencies.   12. In connection with the  observations in paragraph S above as to the probable effect on any future negotiations with foreign countries  of a geographical  differen-negotiation between British subjects,  attention is  drawn  to paragraphs 21 and  22 of aMemorandum  (10  (B)  (30)  15) prepared for  the last Imperial Conference.   It  was there pointed out that the effect,  of admitting that, Dominion British  subjects  mightbe excluded from  the  negotiations would inevitably complicate the discussions inrelation  to Colonial British subjects.   If  a clause wc-re  now inserted  in the indian constitution conferring rights  only  on British subjects domiciled  in the  UnitedKingdom it would increase the difficulty, vis-a-vis foreign countries, of maintaining that for such purposes  the United Kingdom  and the  Dependencies  constitute  anindivisible political entity.
    13.  it  is therefore  urged by the Colonial Office that, if it is  found necessary to recede from the provision embodied in  the first alternative, every effort should at any rate  be made  to  induce India to agree not to discriminate against British subjects domiciled  in Colonies, Protectorates and  mandated territories in which Indians enjoy corresponding  benefits.                               MEMORANDUM II.    1. Admittedly  the clause, whichever of the two alternative forms be adopted, will operate as a restriction of  powers already possessed  by the  Indian Legislature.  It should therefore be drafted  so as to  effect  the minimum amount of  restriction agreed to be uece-^sary in practice.   For all practical purposes it is only the commercial and financial interests  of the United Kingdom which require  protection.  These interests are of enormous importance and their protection is vital to this country, whereas the Dominion and  Colonial interests involved are, in comparison, negligible.    2. The justification for seeking, in derogation of the rights of the Indian Legisla- ture,  a special  protection for persons domiciled in the United  Kingdom is to be found in the intimate partnership which exists, and must for many years continue to exist, between India  and the United Kingdom, a partnership of a special and exceptional kind which has no counterpart in the case of any  Dominion.  The British commercial community in  India is not  a foreign element in that  country, but part of the body politic.  The Calcutta Chamber of Commerce, for example, is a constituency returning members to the Indian Legislature.   .&quot;). The clause is based upon the agreed report  on the subject  by the  Round  Table Conference.  All  the discussions which preceded the agreement were based upon reciprocity between India and the United Kingdom alone.   4. No Indian would cousider any scheme, reciprocal or otherwise, which  purported to secure privileges to the Dominions who have sought to impose  restrictions against Indians in the past.   5. The  Commercial Treaty  analogy is   fallacious.   The  Indian   settlement is exclusively a  matter for  India and  the United Kingdom, and the Dominions  have always disclaimed  any responsibility for Indian affairs.   There is still a  certain unity in the British Commonwealth in the sphere of foreign policy, and the United Kingdom may property be regarded as having a measure  of responsibility in  securing for the Dominions treaty  rights on the  same  basis  as for the United  Kingdom; but the responsibility of the United  Kingdom in the Indian  sphere is sole and undivided.   6. The Foreign Office argument that the  unity of  British  nationality, which in the sphere of foreign policy  it is  essential to maintain, would be imperilled  by the clause, goes too far.   The principle that every Dominion has the right to discriminate between different classes of  British  subjects is recognised by section 26 of the  British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, and more than one Dominion does,  in fact, so discriminate.  &quot; British Indian subjects of His Majesty &quot; are already recognised in Imperial Statutes as a separate category of British subjects.  An arrangement between the United Kingdom and  India for  a special purpose can afford  to no foreign country a sound basis for impeaching the principle for which the  Foreign  Office contend.    7. The clause,  if extended to  the Dominions, would make the Indian Legislature pro tanto subservient to the Dominion Legislatures, who would thus enjoj&apos;  a measure of control  over Indian  legislation without any  corresponding responsibility towards cither India or the United Kingdom.   8. The new Indian constitution  is a first  step  by the Indian Government towards the acquisition of Dominion status, but in no Dominion constitution  is  there  any provision against  discrimination  so far as British subjects generally are concerned. It would be intolerable to impose upon India  an obligation  to accept  provisions to which no  Dominion would for a moment submit in its own case.    There  is nothing in the clause  preventing Dominions from negotiating with the future Indian Governmentfor the purpose of  securing  advantages  for persons  domiciled in the Dominion.   Inthat case, however, the Indian Government will be able to negotiate with a  free bandand on an equal footing with the  Dominion concerned, which would not be  the case if the clause were extended  to  the  Dominions.  This position is strictly in  harmony with the principles underlying the Statute of Westminster.1510B
