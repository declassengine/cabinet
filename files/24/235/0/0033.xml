Copy Mo.__b_&quot;-                        CABINET.                            RUSSIAN  TIMBER.          Memorandum by  the President  of the  Board  of Trade.       I.  I circulate herewith, for the information of  my  colleagues,    a  note summarizing the discussions  which have  been talcing  place    in connexion with a proposed contract for  the  purchase  for next    season by  a  group of  some  170 firms in  this  country  known  as    Timber Distributors Limited, of  a hulk  quantity  of soft-wood    from  Russia.       2,  It  will be seen that the  Canadian Government  have already    (on November 15th) addressed representations to  His  Majesty&apos;s    Government in the United Kingdom drawing attention to the    proposed contract and stating that  if their  information is    accurate,  they will be compelled to appeal for action under    Article  21 of the Agreement concluded with Canada at Ottawa.    Attention was drawn by the Canadian High Commissioner in this    connexion to the  apprehension felt  by the  delegation of British    Columbia timber merchants  and manufacturers  who  were at the  time    visiting this country.       So  It will be seen from the  note that  efforts have  &quot;been  made,    encouraged by my  Department, to  secure  the conclusion of a    contract for the  bulk purchase by  importers  here of  British    Columbia timber.   Investigations in regard to  the possibility of    improving the prospects  for timber  from Eastern  Canada are  still    proceeding,  though it is not possible to say with what  likelihood    of success.       4.  The attempt, so far as British Columbia was concerned,  *    failed,  mainly on tne question of  price.  The  British Columbia    &quot;Oelegation recognized, however,  that there were  other difficulties
such as the serious obstacle presented by the permanent freighthandicap under which British Columbia timber suffers (amountingto a difference of  3 per standard as compared with the freightrate for timber from Northern Europe)e  In addition^ UnitedKingdom users state that they have found British Columbian timoerto be unsuitable in certain respectso  Other difficulties are referred to in the note attached,.   5o  The contract with Russia contemplated until quite recentlyby Timber Distributors Limited was for 450,000 standards, with provision for a marginal increase (or decrease) of 10 per cent.,Le. a maximum of 495,000 standards, any such increase not to heexercised until after August 1st, 1953, and then only? if themarket justified it0  Prom an oral statement &quot;by one of therepresentatives of the syndicate, such increase is to be inrespect of firm sales only.  The prices fixed were in no caselower, and on the bulk of the goods were 7/6dD per standardhigher than the closing prices of 1952.  In addition, the timberis subject to a duty of 10 per cento  The contract was also to contain a &quot;fall and rise&quot; clause whereby the Russians undertook to reimburse the syndicate to an agreed sum per standard of timbershould Swedish and Finnish timber be offered at prices below thosefixed in the Russian contract, and similarly would be entitled toraise the contract prices should there be a general rise inmarket priceso   6o - As a result of the discussions at the Boarqf-wf Trade, thesyndicate have again approached the Russians, and it is nowproposed, in consideration for an increase in the price of thetotal contract of  30,000 (of which  10,000 is to be accountedfor by reduction in the commission the syndicate is to receive)to agree to a minimum of 395,000 standards and a maximum.of435,000 standards.   7.  The arguments advanced in justification of the contractitself and of its size, not only by the syndicate but by the timber Trade. Federation (v/ith whom discussions on the subject of                                -2-
   the proposed contract have been talcing place concurrently with   those with the syndicate) merit serious consideration; they are   set out in the attached note.      8.  It will he necessary presently to decide the attitude to   be adopted towards the request for action under Article 21 of the   Ottawa United Kingdom-Canada Agreement, which we may expect to   receive from the Canadian Government, and of which we have already   received warning in the telegram referred to in paragraph 2 above.      9c  A decision to veto the contract for Russian timber, or to   insist on its drastic reduction, would be regarded by the Soviet   Government as an unfriendly act and would doubtless be the signal   for another outburst of propaganda-  No such action could in any   event be taken before April 17th of next year without violating   the terras *f the Anglo-Soviet Temporary Commercial Agreement of   1930 which does not expire till then.  Any suggestion now that   action of this kind was likely would of course prejudice the   negotiations which are to begin this week for the conclusion of   a new trade agreement with Russia.      10.  It is not of course necessary at this stage to take any   action in regard to the proposed contract.  The syndicate icnow   that any contract they may conclude may be nullified if His   Majesty&apos;s Government are ooliged to prohibit the importation of   the timber and that no rights can be established in virtue of   such a contract.  So long as the present Agreement with Russia   remains in force, it is not possible for us to discriminate in   the way indicated by the Canadian Government.  Moreover, we must   clearly not show our hand until we know how the forthcoming   negotiations are going to shape.  The threat of the exclusion of   Russian timber will be a bargaining counter which we cannot afford   to throw away.

.L :J i)                          APPENDIX.                       RUSSIAN  TIM2ER.     1. It was clear at Ottawa that the Canadian Governmentattaohed  considerable importance to securing a restriction,if not the prohibition, of the entry of Russian timber intothis market.   At times it looked as if there would be no agreement at all If His Majesty&apos;s Government did not satisfy the Canadian requests in this respect.   The result ofprotracted negotiations was the inclusion of Article 21 in theUnited Kingdom-Canadian Agreement, bo which effect is givenby Section 5 of the Ottawa Agreements Act.  The position isthat if at any time the Board of Trade are satisfied that anypreferences granted in fulfilment of the Agreement with Canadaare likely to be &quot;frustrated In whole or in part by reasonof the creation or maintenance, directly or  indirectly, ofprices&quot; for any particular class of commodities through Stateaction on the part of any foreign Government, the Board ofTrade may by Order prohibit the importation into the UnitedKingdom of such commodities produced in that foreign countryfor such time as may be necessary  to make effective and tomaintain such preferences.     2. Following upon the Ottawa Conference and theagreement then reached with Canada, a deputation from theBritish Columbian timber  trade  visited this country lastmonth with a view to seeing how their  trade with this marketmight be extended.  Their visit was largely inspired by theeffect which the recently imposed  United  States tariff has ha-&quot;on  the ImportB of British Columbian timber into the UnitedStates.   The Delegation represented the  Associated TimberExporters of British Columbia,  who, it was claimed, couldspeak for 90a/o of the timber interests  of  the province.  The                            -1-
                                                         1 tf&apos;1?                                                         - \y iDelegation have been studying the United Kingdom market and its needs, specifications, etc, and ib is hoped that asa result of their efforts it will be possible to extend theuse of British Columbian timber here.   In this connection,the statement made by the First Commissioner of Works In theHouse of Commons on 6th December in regard to the use ofcertain Canadian soft woods for major building contracts forwhich tenders are submitted to the Office of Works afterMay, 1933, is of Interest.     3. The export of British Columbian timber to thiscountry has been slowly oxpanding  in recent years and during 1932 it is estimated that about 50,000 standards willbe absorbed.   The timber falls  into two  classes - (a)  the better grade, which sells without  difficulty on Its merits and (b) the commoner grades (generally known as &quot;carcassing&quot;timber) which are competitive with timber from northern europe, including Russia,   The  British Columbian timberexporters, in common with  the exporters of other countries,find it essential to market a quantity of the second gradetimber along with the first grade  timber  if  their trade isto be conducted  on an economic and profitable basis.     4.   The question of a bulk  contract  between the UnitedKingdom importers and the British  Columbian  exporters  was raised and at  the request of  the British  Columbia delegationdiscussions took place  at  the Board of Trade between  the  two parties with a view  to  seeing whether  some arrangement ofthis kind could  not be  reached.    The  British Columbiandelegation said  that  they wished to increase their export of the  seoond grade timber to 75,000  standards  in 1933.   Theexport of this grade  of timber for the current year will amount  to some 12,000  to 15,000  standards.   After a very  full discussion of  the  situation  the  proposed  contre,ct failed,mainly on the  question  of prioe, although the representativesof  the United  Kingdom importers  also made it clear  that their customers In  this  country had a  distinct  preference for theNorth  European timber,  to  which  they were aooustoraed.   They
also argued that they could nob be expeoted to absorb sosudden and so great an increase in the supply of a compara-tively new timber.   The British Columbia delegation reoognisedthat British Columbian timber suffers a permanent handicapin that it has to bear a very much higher freight than the timber from Northern Europe.  At the present time the freightrate from British Columbia per standard of timber is about three times higher than the rate from the 3altic - about 4.10.0 as against about  1.10.    or a difference of  3. 0. 0per standard.   There i3 also the exchange difficulty, and thefurther difficulty that the 3ritish Columbian timber is not normally cut to suit United Kingdom specifications and that to cut it to those speoifioations involves an increase in thepripe.  Also labour costs in British Columbia are high.  Itwill be appreciated that all these factors constitute a veryserious obstaole to the marketing in this country of acomparatively new  timber.     5. The Timber Trade Federation who were representingthe importers Informed the British Columbian delegates thatthey were prepared, however, to uxplore  the ground further.They suggested that there had not been time to  set before theimporters a detailed scheme.  The British Columbia delegationshowed, however, little desire for this further exploration,alleging that six weeks&apos; examination of  the market had satisfiedthem that the low prices prevailing here In this market andtheir own freight handicap presented an  insurmountable obstacle.They  preferred, it would seem, to rely  on other factors toincrease the sale  of their  timber - such as, doubtless, actionin pursuance of Article 21 of the Ottawa Agreement with Canada.     6.  while the British Columbian delegation was here atelegram was addressed by the Canadian Government to theCanadian High Commissioner and its terms coramunicated by the
 latter  to  the Secretary of State for  the Dominione, drawing attention  to the contract for the purchase of Russian timber  which was believed to be under consideration &quot;at a price which appeared to contravene the provisions of Article 21 of the  United Kingdom-Canada Agreement.&quot;   The telegram stated  that the situation was serious and concluded by saying  that if the informstion submitted to the Canadian Government was true they would be compelled to appeal to the Brinish Government to take action under Article 21.   7.   Ouch a contract was in no sense a new departure; for several years post syndicates of  United Kingdom importers  have entered into such contracts with the Russians.  The importers contend strongly that this is the only way,  as past events have proved, to frustrate the Russian tactics of selling dear at the beginning of the season  and then suddenly letting loose later in the season, with disastrous effects on the market, a l?rge surplus  of timber at very low prices.  They argue chat if the market is to ue projected, from onslaughts of this kind the only practicable method ie to contract with the Russians to buy  at  a fixed price a quantity of timber for the year, which mui:t not be exceeded.   8.  The syndicates which has been  negotiating for thebulk purchase of Ruooian timber this  year is TimberDistributors,  Limited,  which includes some 170 firms.   It is the  same Company which has handled the contract for the present year.   The Directors of the Company,  with whom the matter has been diecuused,  have furnished the following figures showing the statistical position of the imports ofRussian sawn softwood during the past two years.                            -4-

As against the import required in 1933 to equal thequantity absorbed in 1932 viz. 611,500 standards, as shownIn the preceding paragraph, the contract originally proposed for the forthcoming yoar was for 450,000 standardswith a provision for a 10% increase (or decrease) anyinorease to be subjeot to the market justifying It and,it would also appear, in respeot only of firm sales.     10.  Timber Distrihutors, Limited, argue that stocksbeing so much less than in previous years, and thecapaoity of the market to absorb the same quantity of timber from Russia as that imported last year being,therefore, greater, they had no oase on oommeroial grounds for contracting for a lower quantity from Russia for next season.   Again, they could not convince the Russians that,If a smaller quantity were oontraoted for, the amount thusfreed would not be taken by Sweden and Finland, and not bygNVB..  &quot;Unsold Stook&quot; means stook in the hands of the  syndicate *  Stocks may have been sold by the oyndioate and  yet still be in the hands of the importers, who buy from  the syndicate.
Canada.   The syndicate pointed out that in any event,in the absence of&apos; a contract, the Russians will resume their selling of an unknown quantity of timber to individualsas best they can, and that the iincertainty as to the amountof timber the Russians  propose to sond here and as to theprice at which it would be sold would have the most disastrousresults on. the stability of the market.     11.  The proposed contract was also to contain a&quot;fall and rise&quot; clause in virtue of which the russians would undertake to reimburse the syndicate to an agreedsum per standard of timber should Swedish and Finnish timberbe offered at prices below those fixed in the Russian contract.The &quot;rise&quot; olause would enable the Russians to raise their prices should there be a general rise in market prices.     12.  The British Columbian Delegation viewed the proposedRussian contract with extreme disfavour.&quot; They contended that it was a deadweight on  the market, and that it didnot give the other suppliers (British Columbia included) afair chance.  In reply to the contention of the UnitedKingdom importers that the bulk contract with Russia was calculated to stabilise pricest the British ColumbianDelegation contended that it f ixod an unduly low e,nduneconomic level and forced  other suppliers to competefieroely for the balance of  the market on even moreuneconomic prices.     13.  This being the position, the Board of Trade,concurrently with  the discussions referred to above for abulk contract for British Columbian timber, arrangeddiscussions with the Directors of Timber Distributors,Limited, and  the representatives of the Timber TradeFederation, both separately  and collectively, regardingthe Russian contract.
  4 (J   14. The attention of the Syndicate and the jj&quot;ederationwas specifically drawn to Article 21 and it was made clearthat the Canadian Government had already drawn attention tothe proposed contract and would probaoly address officialrepresentations to the United Kingdom Government  to take action under that Article should a contract of the sizecontemplated be signed with Russia.   They were furtherwarned that no rights could be established in virtue of sucha contract if one were concluded and if the United KingdomGovernment found it necessary to put Article 21 into operation.At a meeting, held on December 1st, the Parliamentary Secretaryfor the Department of Overseas Trade repeated these warningsand advised the syndicate to reconsider the position and totake no definite ste^ until they had discussed the situationagain in the light of that consideration.   15. At a subsequent meeting on December 5th, the directors of timber Distributors, Limited reported that they had againgone very carefully into the situation and had had furtherprolonged discussions both a7aongst themselves and withthe Russians.   As a result of these negotiations it had beenagreed to modify the terms 03: the proposed contract so asto provide for a minimum quantity of 395,000 standards anda maximum quantity of 435,000 standards.   Apparently underthe proposed contract the Russians would have  the option to ship up to 435,000 standards and, therefore, thedifference between this proposal and the previous proposals!was that the quantity of timber to be  supplied in 1033 was reduced from 450,000 standards which,  with the 105a increaseclause, might have been 495,000 statidards, to 435,000standards.   It  was pointed out to  the syndicate  that  thiswould be regarded as a mere reduction  of 15,000 standards,
on the quantity contracted for in 1932 (see paragraph 9), anathat the objections to the original contract (the particulars of which had become known) would not he likely to he greatlydiminished.  The syndicate made it clear, however, that, taking into account the stocks of unsold Russian timber now in theirh^nds (12,000 standards as compared with 74,000 standards ayear ago) the proposed contract leaves &amp; gap of 77,000 standardsavailable for timber from Canada.  They added that this was thefurthest to which they could persuade the Russians to go andth t they felt that on commercial grounds they had no case forinsisting upon a lower quantity.  The market here had readilyabsorbed this year more than 500,000 standards of Russiantimber and the stocks at present in the hands of importerswere practically exhausted.  They further stated that theyhad only been able to secure the agieement with the russians to this reduced quantity by themselves agreeing to an increasein price.   16.  The revised draft contract contains the &quot;fall and rise&quot;clause.  The prices fixed are for the most part higher thanthose ruling at the opening of the 1932 season.  Prices fellduring the present year owing to undercutting by the Swedesand Finns and the fall clause accordingly came into operation.Some of the prices in the contract originally proposed for next season were lower than those for the opening of the 1932season but the enhanced price which has hod to be agreed upon for the purpose of modifying the contract has resulted in theseprices nov being either the same or higher than the opening19o2 prices.  In one or two casas-prices are still a -littlelower than these opening prices.  In the contract for thepresent season a reduction in price was allowed for in respectof late shipments.  This induction is not to apply in the newcontract with the result that there is an advance of 17s. 6d.per standard on certain red wood as compared with the closingprices for 1932.  At least half the entire contract for 1933                             -3-
will consist of this kind of wood.  Similarly, the prices for white wood, which comprises about one-fifth of the total quantity, is increased by, on the average, 11/- per standard.   17.  It is evident that further discussion with the directors of Timber Distributors, Limited is not likely tocarry the matter any further.  The syndicate realise that anycontract they may conclude is subject to nullification by theoperation of Article 21.  They know that a telegram has beenreceived by the Canadian Government drawing attention to theproposed contract and further that, following upon the breakdown of the negotiations between the British ColumbianDelegation and the United Kingdom importers, the Premier ofBritish Columbia was reported in the Press to have telegraphedto Mr. Bennett asking him to take up with the United Kingdomthe question of unfair  competition.  They realise, too, theCanadian Government will doubtless argue that a contract for anamount only 15,000 standards less in 1953 is   inconsistent withthe Ottawa Agreement, and further that the fixing of a price for about one-third of this country^ timber imports must in theCanadian view&apos;3argely determine the price for the whole market,the market being thus depressed  in advance, because Russianprices can afford to &apos;.;be low on  account of the State monopoly.  . 18o  It should be added that, while the discussions with canadian interests have hitherto centred around BritishColumbian  timber, because of the presence of  the delegation in the country,  that Province is by no means  the only source of canadian timber.  There is also  the  timber of  the MaritimeProvinces  and  the Ottawa Valley.  The trade in timber betweenthe Maritime Provinces  and  this  country in recent years has  notbeen  very  large because the  Canadians have mainly concentrated ontheir wood pulp  industry and the United States markets.   However,the  contraction  in  the  wood  pulp industry, coupled with  the  newUnited  States  tariff, has  turned the minds of the Canadiantimber  growers again to this marketo  The difficulty  is  that
fthe Canadian timber industry in the Maritime Provincesdoes not seem to he organised, hut enquiries are &quot;beingmade to see whether it might &quot;be possible to arrange for some kind of bulk purchase of this timber.  The MaritimeProvinces are free of some of the handicaps with which theBritish Columbian industry is faced and in particular theredoes not exist so serious a freight differential as thatwhich exists in the case of British Columbia,   19o  With regard to the Ottawa Valley, the Board of Tradeare in touch with one of the principal British firms havingbusiness connections with that part of Canada and it ishoped that in the near future it will be possible to exploreand elucidate the position.
