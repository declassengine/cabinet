Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1932.SECRET.                                               Copy No.   9CP. 414  (32).                                CABINET.LAND  SETTLEMENT.                NOTE BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    I CIRCULATE herewith  a note prepared in the Treasury on the second report  of  the  Unemplovment  Committee  dealing  with  Land  Settlement(U.C. (32) 28-also CP. 406 (32)).                                   ^    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,         November 29,  1932.UNEMPLOYMENT  COMMITTEE.     Land Settlement.    1.  The Report of the Cabinet Unemployment Committee on Land Settle-ment recommends the setting up by legislation of a new independent Commission.on Public Utility Company lines, to raise money (with State guarantee) in orderto provide a &quot; minimxim &quot;  of  1,000 small holdings next year, and  2,500 a year for the following four years, for unemployed and employed persons (who are tobe lent working capital where necessary) at, it is stated, a gross capital cost ofabout  1&quot;, including training  costs, per 1,000 holdings, or (say) a  total cost of all  to   12m (in order to allow  for admittedly higher costs  in  Scotland),  aconsiderable proportion of  which would be irrecoverable.   Until the necessary legislation is passed, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries are to go ahead with  inteisim  schemes for 1,000  holdings  under the  Land  Utilisation  Act.Further, County  Councils are  to continue indefinitely with their normal SmallHoldings work for persons with capital,  and are to be subsidised by the State, as now, to the extent of 75 per cent, of the net loss; and in Scotland the Departmentof Agriculture for Scotland are to  continue to do similar work, which now costs the State some  125,000 a year.    2.  On the basis of what is, in effect, a State loan for the purpose,  withsinking funds running  for varying periods up  to 40 years for buildings  and80 years for land, the Committee state the net cost in England and Wales of the&quot; minimum &quot; programme of 11,000 holdings proposed at:     (1)  Recurrent (excess of payments over receipts)                     First 12 years      &quot;...       ...      ...    123,253 a year           Next 28&apos;  ,,         ...       ...      ...     95,599  ,,    (2)  Non-recurrent payments, irrecoverable            Other than training ...       ...       ...   1,166,000 lump sum           Training  (on the assumption  that only               -^-rd of the men would  be  trained)    256,666 1,422,666[7920]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
     The Committee express the view that the,State can justifiably undertake theirrecoverable, non-recurrent expenditure at (2), &quot; in that a saving to public fundsmay be anticipated in the increase of  employment that would result and in thepermanent removal of the settlers from the sphere of Unemployment insurance and Public Relief.&quot;  They add that the capital (though not the annual) cost ofthe scheme stated above, would be reduced if existing Government land were used and some of the settlers provided  the whole or part  of their working capital;but  per contra  that  the  costs in  Scotland  will  be  higher than  stated  above(paragaphs 28 and 29 suggest that the  expenditure on land and buildings will be over 45 per cent, higher in Scotland).     3.  Even on the case as stated,  this expensive  proposal  clearly  is not aremunerative scheme, acceptable as such to the Government, within the terms ofrecent declarations  of public policy. But the weakness of the scheme from thispoint of view has not been fully stated, and  the following considerations mustbe urged, in  addition,  against it :-     (1) The direct net financial out-turn would probably be much more unfavour-able than that suggested.     (a) There would be little chance of securing a real net saving either by theuser of Government land  or by selecting  as  settlers  unemployed persons withcapital available; and in  so  far as holdings  were given instead to employed persons with capital, the possibility of effecting a resulting saving on unemploy:ment insurance or relief would be made more  remote.     (b) Scottish costs would, admittedly, be much higher than those in the table.     (c) The  dead loss on initial  advances of working capital,  which is put inthe detailed  estimate at  only 10  per cent., has, it is.understood, in past  casesbeen as high as  50  per cent., and might, even with all care in selection, be verymuch higher than 10 per cent, under  the  proposed scheme.     (d) Moreover, the statement  of loss on working capital  excludes the laterannual loss  in respect of the fresh issues of working capital  which would berequired from time to time on the occurrence  of vacancies; and, similarly, theexpenditure on maintenance allowances, removals, local supervision, administra-tion and training would  to some  extent be continuing, annual expenditure andnot non-recurrent as stated. .     (e) It is doubtful whether as much as 3 per cent, oh the  capital  could beobtained in  rents from men with short training and without  the incentive of having their own capital to work  for, and  whether  the men would be  self-supporting (and therefore without  insurance or relief) as soon  as expected.     (/) The estimate of capital expenditure is a &quot; cut&quot; estimate, especially forholdings for employed persons, and might under pressure for improvement, provefar too low.     (g) Finally,  the loan charges  for  most of the Capital expenditure, on  thebasis, adopted &quot;in the  report, might be continuing for many  years after  the cessation  of  Widespread  unemployment in this cduritry, and Would  have  to berecalculated,  for safety, over a very short period.     It is clear, therefore, that the scheme is likely to be much more unremunerativethan the printed figure would suggest.     (2) Account must also be taken of the indirect, results which would follow from acceptance of such  a scheme at a time when there is constant pressure onthe Government  for further  economies, and when the world is watching to see whether the existing policy of retrenchment, in this country is to be maintained.The postponement of land settlement expenditure was one of last year&apos;s &quot; white paper &quot; economies, and  the reversal  of  the  decision would  be  a dangerous precedent. The  scheme would also operate for  the first time the expensive  LandUtilisation Act,  which contains other costly  items  and  has,  so  far, Been in abeyance; and a  decision to operate the  Act would be contrary to  i^he recdmmenda-tion of the Local Authorities&apos; Expenditure Committee, published! last week, thatthe Act should be repealed forthwith.   The scheme is also open to  objection ascreating an awkward precedent (new,  save in  the case of post-war  schemes forex-Servibe men)  for advancing Jarge amounts of working capital to employed, aswell as unemployed, persons without resources, and as duplicating to some extent the existing  small-Holdings work of County  Councils, and setting up a secondsmall-holdings staff in various parts of the country.
                                     3     (3) Finally, as the proposed loan would, in effect, be a State loan (despite thetransparent device of Creating a  special Corporation, to borrow with  Stateguarantee and  to  spend  the money without proper administrative control), thescheme would  negative  the declared policy of  the  Government that  Stateexpenditure which is not fully remunerative must be met out of current revenue and not borrowed.  The results of such a reversal of policy would be damaging tothe national credit, here and abroad. The scheme could, therefore, only be financedout  of revenue;  and  as the net  cost would  approximate to  1&apos;&quot; next  yearand  in each of the succeeding 4 years over  2m a year, the programme  couldnot, in present ch^cumstances, be financed, even if the other objections referred toabove did not exist, without an increase of budgetary expenditure which could notat present be contemplated.
