Q[lIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIO MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.                                                                   4 4 secret.                                                      OOPY NO.,P. 403 (32)CABINET.        Commercial Negotiations with Foreign Countries.               Position of the Fishing Industry.      Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     Negotiations for Trade Agreements with the scandinavian countries have now started.   My aim in these negotiationswill be to secure three principal objects: (l) arrangementsfor inoreased uae of British ooal by the various Scandinavianindustries, (2) security for the maintenance of what ingeneral are comparatively low rates of duty for other BritishexportB of importance, and (3) in a limited number of casesaotual reductions of duty whore rates higher than the usuallevel are imposed on important lines of British trade.     In order to achieve this we shall oertainly be askedto give undertakings limiting the duty levied on the principalScandinavian products, and in certain oases to agree toreduce duties below those which as the result of the recommenda-tlons of the Import Duties Advisory Committee have been imposed on particular manufactures that interest Scandinavia.It is impossible to say in advance how far we ought to beready to go in this direction.  We shall have in eaoh case to balance advantages against disadvantages.  We 3hould obviouslyseek to come to such an arrangement as would not merelysafeguard our existing position in the Scandinavian marketsbut would enable us to show that the prospect of increasing our trade in these markets exceeds any risk of losses to our home trade as a result of the admission of inoreaaedquantities of goods from Scandinavia.   The objects of ourpresent Tariff Policy are, I take it, twofold, the reductionof the previous visible adverse balance of trade and the                             -1-
                                                         1 nIncrease of employment In the United Kingdom. - Consequentlyour negotiations should also have a twofold aim, i.e. weshould aim at inoreaaing our exports by an amount greaterthan any inorease of Imports that may result from any relaxation of our tariffs, and at ensuring that any 103sof employment resulting from such relaxation will be morethan counterbalanced by an increase of employment in ourexporting trr.de s, more especially, in the particular oase of scandinavia, by an inorease of employment in our coal mines.     Th^ point, however, to which I wish to oall special.attention is that, as in all tariff negotiations, we cannot expect to secure these results without having to make some concessions which will not be welcomed by some of theindustries affected.   If, for example, in order to arriveat a satisfactory agreement, it becomes necessary to reducethe protection now afforded to a particular Industry, weshall certainly have to face complaints, and it will ofcourse be a poor consolation to that industry to be told that other  interests will have gained more than they 3tandto lose.   Unless we aro ready to face such a situationall attempts to negotiate a tariff bargain might as wellbe abandoned at the start.     A particular oase has in fact already arisen.  Manyof my colleagues must recently have become aware of a growingagitation amongst the trawl fishermen of thi3 country against any steps being taken in  the forthcoming negotiations with might withhold from the fishing Industry advantagesfor which they ask  under our Tariffs.  The presentposition is that the trawl fishermen applied some time agoto tho Import Duties Advisory Committee for an  inorease ofthe existing duty of 10 per cent, on the importation of fresh fish.  The Committee have recently informed them thatthe Oommittee are not at present prepared  to recommend any
increase of duty on fish, but that  they will be preparedto ronew their consideration of the matter early next year.&quot;The fishermen are accordingly naturally anxious that nothingwe may do in the forthcoming negotiations may prejudice their future position.   It happens, however, that the importsof fish from three of the Scandinavian countries, Norway,Denmark and Iceland, with which negotiations have been, or  -are about to be, instituted, are  considerable, and we are aware that an undertaking to  maintain the existing 10 percent, duty on such fish  (we are precluded by the ottawa agreements from reducing the duty below 10 per cent.) will certainly be pressed for.   I cannot, of course, say atpresent what emphasis will be laid  on thi3 particular question, but it is obvious that  it is one of severalrequests of this  kind which we shall have to consider.Thus requests will no doubt be made to reduce the existingduties upon paper and to stabilise  or reduce the existingduties on timber products.   I may  mention that in the caseof  timber the interests  concerned in this country havealready made an application  to the  Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee for increased  protection, an application which has,however, not yet been considered  in detail.     Of course while I feel  it necessary  to ask for authority to discuss any proposals  affecting Britishindustries which the Scandinavian countries may put forward,I should not propose to  commit the  Government until I  amin  a position to present a oomplete picture of  the advantages and possible disadvantages which  might result from  theconclusion of any particular agreement.
