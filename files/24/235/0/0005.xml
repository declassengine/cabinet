THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1932.SECRET.Copy  No.9CP.  405  (32).CABINET.ANGLO-SOVIET RELATIONS.     IN the absence of the  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I think it necessary to raise the following matter for consideration by my colleagues, with reference to the memorandum OP. 154 (32) on the question of Soviet propaganda, which he  submitted to the Cabinet on the 7th May last.     2.  Lord  Denbigh gave notice on the 9th November that he would move the following resolution in the House of Lords on the 15th November :          &quot; To call the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the telegram in     the  Times of  the 8th  November  from  their  Riga correspondent, and to     the instructions  issued from Moscow  to Communist organisations abroad,     stating that:              &quot; The world&apos;s masses are now about to enter the second revolutionary         phase that  of revolutions and wars;             &quot; That universal war is now inevitable and not far distant; and             &quot; Taking credit for the action in the British section in organising         strikes and disorders-in Manchester, London,  Liverpool and Glasgow;         and             &quot; In taking over the leadership of the unemployed;         &quot;And to ask His Majesty&apos;s Government  what steps they now propose     to take with a  view  to meeting this open declaration of war and  revolution     in this country;  and whether  they  continue  to give the same amount of     diplomatic immunity to the Soviet Mission in London.&quot;     3.  As no confirmation of the telegram in question was then available a telegram (a copy of which is Annex 1), was sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow, in a non-confidential code,  requesting a telegraphic report on the matter. Sir E. Ovey&apos;s reply  (a copy of which is Annex 2), arrived on the 12th November, and showed that the  document in question was  a summary  of  a speech by Manuilski, a member  of  the Presidium of the Communist International, to  the &quot;Committee of Action&quot; of the Moscow branch of  the All-Union Communist party, on the results of the twelfth plenary  session  of the International, the text of which had appeared in the Moscow Pravda of the 2nd November.    4.  Speeches of this nature are not uncommon at the meetings of Communistorganisations;  and  though  this speech showed  more clearly  than is  usual  theconnexion between  the Soviet  Government  and  the  Communist International.particularly in the mention  of Stalin by  name, I would not have proposed that special notice  should be taken of it, had it remained an isolated phenomenon.Meanwhile, however, four telegrams  (Annexes 3, 4, 5, 6), have been received fromSir E. Ovey, which put an entirely new complexion on the question.    5.  It will be  seen  from these documents that the Izvestiya, the officialorgan of the Central  Executive Committee of the Soviet Government,  accusesHis Majesty&apos;s  Government  of forging evidence against the Soviet  Governmentin order  to justify  the denunciation of the Trade Agreement,  that the SovietGovernment have so far refused satisfaction to Sir E. Ovey&apos;s representations6615  [7889]B
2on the subject, and that he has every reason to believe that the articles containing the accusations were prepared in the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs at Moscowas a result of the interception of a diplomatic telegram.    6.  I feel sure that my colleagues will  agree  with me in  thinking  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government cannot ignore  this action or contemplate the  conduct  ofany negotiations with  the  Soviet  Government until  they have obtained bothsatisfaction on  this matter  and some assurance of a  change  in  the general attitude of the Soviet authorities.  I therefore submit that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should be authorised to speak to the Soviet Ambassador  inLondon, and, if necessary, to instruct Sir E. Ovey to speak at Moscow, in thefollowing sense :         Various matters  of difficulty and complexity, particularly in relation to    trade between  the  Soviet  Union  and  this country, will shortly arise for    discussion  between the  two Governments.   If the Soviet Government wish    these matters to be discussed in the usual manner as between Governments in    friendly relations, they must         (a) take steps  to ensure that no further  remarks of  the kind  made  by               Manuilski are made in future  (they will probably  maintain,  as               usual, that they are not responsible for the  Communist Inter-               national, but they have in the past put some check on its activities               in answer to representations from His Majesty&apos;s Government);               and        (b) apologise  for the  language of  the  Izvestiya,  which  was  quite               unprovoked, since,  as  was  clear from the  telegram  (see para-               graph 3), at the time of its publication His Majesty&apos;s Government               had taken no  action  beyond  calling for  a report on  a  press               allegation.    7.  It should further be firmly pointed out to the Soviet Government that future indulgence in these malevolent  tactics, as described in paragraph 5 above.would only  result in confusing the issue between commercial negotiations and propaganda, and thereby  rendering the former, which should be treated on their merits, impossible of conclusion.    8.  The above suggestions are  subject to discussion with my colleagues; but some such action seems urgently required, as Sir E. Ovey has asked for immediateinstructions, and, though Lord Denbigh has agreed to postpone his resolution,the statements  in the Izvestiya, which have now been reproduced in the british press, can hardly fail to provoke further agitation in Parliament and among thepublic.    9.  In Sir E. Ovey&apos;s  opinion, the time has come to inform the Soviet Govern-ment  that this  campaign  is not only insupportable, but can only do them harm,and that  they must  either stop it or state clearly that  they believe all  the assurances given by members of His Majesty&apos;s Government and by his Excellencyhimself are so much bluff.  In his view, it is obviously essential to make a strong protest, to be accompanied by one final and  categorical assurance that the policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government is to promote trade relations on a permanent and stable basis, and by a request that the Soviet Government  state clearly in their reply what their policy towards us really is.    10.   I  share this view, and suggest, for my  colleagues&apos; consideration, that action  in this  sense  be authorised  in addition to  the other  proposals  inparagraphs 6 and 7 above.

ANNEX 1.                   Sir John Simon to Sir E. Ovey (Moscow).(No. 76.)  R.                      Foreign Office, November 9, 1932, 540 P.M.    &quot; TIMES &quot; of 8th November reports from Riga issue of survey of Cominternactivities abroad, addressed to Communist organisations in Moscow, referring toStalin&apos;s personal leadership of movement, to its success in promoting disorder inEngland, and to prospect of civil war in  India.    Matter  will he raised in Parliament on 15th  November.  Please report ondocument by telegram in time  for debate, showing particularly whether it containsmore  than  usual  evidence  of  connexion  between  Comintern  and  SovietGovernment.                                 ANNEX 2.       Sir E. Ovey to Sir John Simon. -(Received November 12, 9 A.M.)                                               Moscow, November 11, 1932.(No. 199.)   R.                                   (November 11, 11-26 P.M.)    YOUR telegram No. 76.    Document in question appears to be an abridged text of speech by  Manuilskito Committee of Action of Moscow branch of  All-Union Communist party, onresults of 12th plenary  session of Comintern, which occupied nearly  two wholepages of &quot;&apos; Pravda &quot; of 2nd November.    Official  complicity  of official  Soviet Government in Comintern activity isnowhere mentioned in the speech, but the fact of &apos;&apos;  existence  of Union of soviet socialist Republics   as a State is quoted as influencing collapse of capitalism.and elsewhere toiling masses are said to be approaching new phase of  revolutionand war,  &quot; not  unarmed, but  having  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  aspowerful bastion of  world  revolution.&quot;  As regards association of Stalin  inManuilski&apos;s  speech with Comintern activity, &quot;the Comintern,&quot; Manuilski  says.&quot; has the firm leadership of his (Lenin&apos;s) best collaborator, Stalin.&quot;  (Applause.)&quot; Confidence  of  world proletariat  in the new  phase of revolution and war isStalin&apos;s  contribution to history.&quot;  (Literally,  &quot;historic  service of Stalin.&quot;)&quot; Under  his  leadership  workers of all  the  world go forward to the  victoriousstruggle,&quot; &amp;c.   The speech ends:  &quot;Hail to the world  revolution! Hail to itsleader, Comrade Stalin !    As regards relationship between Comintern and A.U.C.P., Manuilski states:&quot; We, members of A.U.CP., are faced by important question of why  revolutionis held back  in capitalistic countries.&quot; Manuilski refers  later to &quot; our  party &quot; inGermany.  There  is nothing new in this identity,  which is illustrated  by  well-known existence of  &quot;delegation of A.U.C.P. to Comintern.&quot;  The  latterdelegation is mentioned  by Manuilski as voicing general opinion of A.U.C.P. inurging support of German Communist party.    In other respects contents of speech  are  officially  material of  Cominternreport,  and  brief  references  to  British Empire  are  numerous  in  reviewingsuccesses of  Communist movement.  Activity  of  Communist  party of  GreatBritain in miners&apos; and spinners&apos;  strikes, its campaign  in-support of &quot;indian national Revolutionary  and Workers&apos; Movement &quot;  is lauded, while successes of&quot;unemployed organisation, led by Communists,&quot;  counting  &quot; 50,000  men  withmembership cards,&quot; is  recorded.  In India &quot;English terrorism&quot; is mentioned,and &quot; change from civil  disobedience to outbreak of civil  war in the near  future &quot;is predicted, as indicated in your telegram.   In paragraph of  speech dealing-with Communist movements in military forces,  and mainly dealing with France.Invergordon  incident is  referred to as &quot; of very great importance.&quot;    These references to the success of Communist  propaganda refer  to activity of National  Communist parties,  but  it  should be emphasised  that these are regarded as branches of Comintern, and that they  and  the latter are  mentionedalmost indiscriminately as directing organisations,  especially  in the case  ofGermany.    For theses of executive of Comintern, see my despatch No. 603 of 25th October.[7889]

Moscow, November 13, 1932.             (No. 201.)   R.                                        (November 13, 8  P.M.)                  MY telegram No. 199.                  &quot; Izvestiva&quot; this morning published  following message entitled &quot; Anti-             Soviet-lJ&apos;fovocateurs at Work,&quot; dated London, 8th November, and stated to  have             been received from their  correspondent by post :-                  According to trustworthy information  intelligence  service, in organising  a             question in Parliament against Soviet Government, instructed  its agents in  Riga             at beginning of November  to fabricate  documents and materials showing that             Comintern,  under personal  direction of  Stalin, is organising the movement of             unemployed in England and preparation of civil war in India.  Riga agents have             evidently carried out this instruction, seeing  that already in the &quot;Times&quot; of             8th November there appeared requisite telegram from Riga in a spirit of calumny       &apos;     against Comintern and Soviet power.cm ^         x    On basis of  message in the &quot;Times&quot;  fabricated by agents  of intelligence-^r&apos;i ^V*^  Y-*-service, British Ministry for Foreign Affairs  asked agents of Great Britain in  j   c,  cv&apos;  Moscow to furnish any documents, real oi^ bogus, which might, however remotely,   ,,.v      \C  confirm documents fabricated  by intelligence service concerning  direction  of             Comintern and of its organisations by Soviet power, and concerning identity of    &apos;1 ^n   Comintern and Soviet Government.             r\   According to a communication  from the  same  sources, Moscow agents of-Iw           tne British Governmentjnnj^jmjpply thejse^pj^ujments urgently, so that it  may be\^c^%.^&quot;y   possible to  have even   appearance  of^atefial  for forthcoming  anti-Sovietv-cr&apos;^       parliamentary question put by certain groups of Conservative members.    It  is             evident that the British  Government itself considers this question opportune in             order to justify retrospectively denunciation of Anglo-Soviet Commercial Agree-             ment, and thus  to set  up  this campaign  against new ever-growing wave  of             opposition in England in connexion with  denunciation of commercial agreement.                                 ANNEX 4.      Sir E. Ovey to Sir John Simon. (Received November 14, 9-30 A.M.)                                              Moscow, November 13, 1932.(No. 202.) R,                                      (November 14, 1 - 35 P.M.)    MY immediately preceding telegram.    &apos;&apos; Izvestiya &apos;&apos; also  publishes leading article, &apos;&apos; How forgeries are concoctedwhen it is necessary,&quot; of which following is the purport:- -    Whatever purpose British Government may have had in denouncing  Anglo-Soviet  Agreement, consequence has  been to open the flood-gates of anti-soviet propaganda by those who wish to damage Anglo-Soviet relations.  The curtainconcealing their activities is partially lifted by &quot; information reported by one ofour London correspondents in a telegram [sic] published to-day,&quot; which showsthat English intelligence,  which in 1919 printed a false issue of &apos; Pravda &apos; andsupplied Lord  Curzon  and Mr.  Ramsay MacDonald  with forgeries,  is againactive.    &quot;They  have  ordered from  their  Riga...agency  forgeries proving  &apos; thatComintern, under personal leadership &quot;6&quot;f&quot;Stalin,  is organising unemployed move-ment in England and preparing for civil war in  India.  The &quot; Times &quot;  article isthe beginning of press campaign.&apos;    &quot;After information furnished  by our  correspondent,  a  parliamentary question is being got ready and Ministry for Foreign Affairs, going half-way tomeet this &quot;class command,&apos; has already requested agents of  Great Britain in moscow  to  furnish it with  documents  which might  support statements  of intelligence.  Ministry for Foreign Affairs  requests  urgent  supply of  this material.  It is evidently  ready to face the fact that quality provided will suffer
from this  haste.  Intelligence  goads  Parliament;  die-hard  members  goadMinistry  for Foreign Affairs; and Ministry for Foreign Affairs goads Englishagents in U.S.S.R.  Who  will be surprised after  this if  documents  concoctedwill resemble truth as  little as  documents which Lord  Curzon  in  his timeprovided ?     &quot;A fact which we will not rebut is that not only is Stalin leader of Sovietproletariat,  but that in him tens of millions of workers and peasants throughoutthe world see their leader.&quot;  ^ But any suggestion  that Stalin is responsible for the state of affairs in theworld is mere raving.     &quot; If there is confirmation of information of our correspondent, to the effectthat competent department of English Government  instructed English  agents in moscow to send them with the utmost despatch documents  regarding complicityof Soviet  Government in unemployment movement in  England or  in preparationof civil  war in India,&quot; then this is only evidence that former Liberal  ministers are ready to do  anything prescribed by their new-found friends the die-hards.     Text by post.                                  ANNEX 5.       Sir E. Ovey to Sir John Simon. (Received November 14, 9-30 A.M.)                                               Moscow, November 13, 1932. -(No. 203.)                                         (November 14, 1-45 A.M.)     MY telegrams Nos. 201 and 202.     I have protested in strongest terms on telephone to Rubinin.   He replied, -after consulting M. Litvinov, that &quot; Izvestiya &quot; was not under the control  of the Government, &amp;c, and that his Department would do nothing  in the matter.     I insisted strongly that I must have more than this.  After further consul- tation with M. Litvinov, he told me that Commissariat for Foreign Affairs were -convinced that neither  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government nor myself  could  possibly descend to  this (falsification of  reports for sabotaging our relations), but he reiterated that the Government could  not control &quot;Izvestiya&quot;  and would not -exercise any influence on  it. He went on to say  in justification  that a  lot of unfriendly articles had appeared in the English press, and referred particularly to  remarks by  Mr.  Thomas.  I  said  I  must  understand the attitude of his Department to be  that they approved  of this anti-English  press campaign inasmuch as they  justified appearance of such articles in &quot; Izvestiya &quot; and  would do nothing to stop them until apparently His Majesty&apos;s Government had abolished the liberty of the press in Great Britain.  In Great Britain the press was free to attack everybody, including the  Government itself; here it was  allowed only to attack foreigners.  It would be laughable for me to try to persuade His Majesty&apos;s Government that Soviet Government could exercise no influence over official organ of  Central ExecutiveTJbmmittee, of which Kalinin is  president&quot;.  It there  was anything exaggerated fri my interpretation,  his Department had better  instruct Soviet Ambassador in London to explain  to you personally.     In the meantime my intermediary  is speaking to the real Government.  He-suggested that I should  see M. Litvinov f  I pointed dirt the &quot;discourtesy of latter (see last sentence  of my telegram No. 200) and quoted Rubinin&apos;s first reply.  If this sort of thing went on, I should be  finally forced  to  believe that policy of Stalin was to break off relations with Great Britain. This he stoutly denied.  He would do what he could and report,  to which I replied that any explanation or apology must be official and come through Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.     Please instruct me at once as to representations you would wish to be  made. May I suggest that, in view of recalcitrant attitude which M. Litvinov invariably-adopts   at  first  (however  much he may be disavowed  by his  Government-afterwards), it might be useful  if you spoke to Soviet Ambassador in the first instance ?               -
                                 ANNEX 6.       Sir E. Ovey to Sir John Simon. [Received November 14, 9 A.M.)                                               Moscow, November 13, 1932.(No. 204.)                                         [November 14, 1-35 A.M.)     MY immediately preceding telegram.     I have little personal doubt, though no real proof may ever be forthcoming,.that both the report  alleged to be from London, by post,  and leading articles,.which incidentally refer to that report as a telegram, were deliberately preparedby Press Department of Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on basis of garbledreading of your telegram No. 76, which was in &quot; R &quot; code.       &apos;       &quot; &apos;--it might be interesting to&quot;make enquiries of &quot; Izvestiya &quot; correspondent, who-is an Englishman.o
