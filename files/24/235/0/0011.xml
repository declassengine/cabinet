THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1932.SECRET.                                               Copy No.    9CP.  411 (32).CABINET.HOUSING  POLICY SCOTLAND.          MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR  SCOTLAND.     1.   I HAVE been in consultation with the Minister of Health on the subject of housing policy, and  am  generally in agreement  with his views as to the desirability of withdrawing housing subsidies whenever it is possible to do so, as expressed in his Memorandum, dated the 17th November, 1932 (CP. 386  (32)). The modifications which  I have to  suggest in his proposals are dictated by the special circumstances of Scotland in regard to housing.     2.   In spite of all our efforts since 1919, the housing shortage in Scotland is still acute.  According to statements received from local authorities in 1930 it was estimated that, apart from the houses required to meet the annual normal needs of the  population, 67,464 houses were required to replace houses unfit for human habitation,  to abate  overcrowding,  and  for other  miscellaneous reasons.   The clearance or improvement of slum areas and the abatement of overcrowding are therefore matters which still demand unremitting attention.  The recent Census reports show  that, while there has been  considerable improvement since 1921, overcrowding  is still very prevalent. For example, in Glasgow, 58-1 per cent, of the houses are of one and two rooms, while 55-4 per cent, of the total population live in  houses of these sizes;  of the one-roomed  houses,  12,930 are occupied  by 4  persons and over; and of these houses, 1,598  had 7 occupants  and over. The corresponding figures for the other three large cities show that conditions in Dundee are slightly worse, and in Edinburgh and Aberdeen somewhat better, than in Glasgow.  These four cities comprise 38-6 per cent,  of the whole population of Scotland.     3.  Scotland&apos;s special housing  problem has  been recognised by successive Governments.  Thus,  at the first revision of the subsidies payable under the 1923and  1924 Acts, when the subsidies for England were reduced, those for scotland were allowed to remain at their original figure.  Again, when the second revisiontook place, and further reductions were made as regards England,  the Scottishsubsidies were only brought down to the level of the English subsidies as fixed atthe time of the first revision.   (The  reductions made at the second revision wererestored in both countries  by the Housing (Revision of Contributions) Act, 1929.)In the cutting  down of housing subsidies, therefore, Scotland has always remained a step behind England.                                 1924 Act.     4.  At present the subsidy under the  1924 Act stands at its original figureof  9 for Scotland, whereas  in England it has been reduced to  7 10s.  total abolition  would,  therefore, mean a larger step in Scotland than  it would  inEngland and from investigations which I have  made I am satisfied that it wouldbe unsafe to withdraw immediately and at one stroke the whole of the subsidypayable under  the 1924 Act.
     5.  Differing from  the  English  Committee  on  Local  Expenditure,  thecorresponding Scottish Committee, while recommending withdrawal of the 1924Act subsidy,  have  specifically excluded  from their  recommendation  &quot; housesrequired to accommodate (a)  persons  displaced from unhealthy or overcrowdedhouses, so far as these are not  dealt with under the 1930 Act* and (&amp;) agricultural workers or persons of the same economic condition.&quot;   Moreover, the Committee, intheir discussion of the question of the extent to which private enterprise mightbe expected to supply  normal housing needs, say :          &quot; We  consider that  the time has  now come when private enterprise     unaided could  supply  all the houses that are  required, other than  those     necessary to house dispossessed tenants  from slum and overcrowded houses     and low wage earners.&quot;     6.  These reservations, made by a Committee who have reviewed the wholefield of local expenditure and whose report  shows  anxiety for drastic economy,are of considerable significance and they support the conclusion at which I havearrived after separate  examination of the housing position.     7.  Whatever may be the cause, it is  a  fact that private enterprise has  notfunctioned to anything like the same extent in Scotland as it has done in England.For example, I find that of the total houses erected since 1919 in England, privateenterprise has produced about 69 per  cent., whereas, of the total houses  erectedin Scotland  during the  same period, private  enterprise has produced only 31 percent.  The  difference is even  more  pronounced when  the figures for the yearended  the 31st March,  1931,  are compared.   In that year private enterprise inEngland erected 128,728 houses without  State assistance, whereas the  corres-ponding  figure  for  Scotland  was   only   1,408.   These   figures  representapproximately 41 per cent,  and 11 per cent, respectively of the total number ofhouses erected in the two countries during that year.     8.  It is obvious, therefore, that, if subsidy were wholly withdrawn, privateenterprise would have  to fill  a much  wider gap in Scotland  than in  England,and  for that reason  it  would  take a longer  time to get into its full stride.  Inthe interval some subsidised provision will,  I am convinced, require to be madein respect of houses erected to abate overcrowding  and to meet the case of thelow wage earner who cannot afford to pay an economic rent for a house erectedat present-day building costs.   In contradistinction  to the situation in England,there is little immediate prospect of  Scottish local authorities erecting houseswithout State assistance at  a  time when they are being urged  to cut down  their expenditure, because, after allowance is made for the fall which has taken placein building costs  and in the rate of interest,  these authorities are still unable toprovide houses to let at a reasonable rent, especially at a  rent within the meansof the low wage  earner, without charge to the local rates.     9.   The Building  Societies,  as  in  the  case  of England, have  submitted proposals to me whereby their funds would be made available, on terms, for  theprovision of new houses for sale or for letting to working class occupiers.   Theseproposals are  being  examined.   They  involve  negotiations with the  localauthorities.   I am also conferring with representatives of the building trades.As regards  the proposals, it has to be borne in mind that the Building Societymovement is much less strong in Scotland than it is in  England.  Until  three off four years  ago,  when a number of English  Societies opened branches inScotland (mainly in  Edinburgh), the extent of the Building Societies&apos; operationswas extremely limited.  Under  the  stimulus of  competition their business is steadily increasing,  but further time is  required  in order to see  how far  the societies will be able to assist in the provision of houses for the working  classes,and  the extent to which private builders will  produce such houses with or withoutthe aid of the financial facilities offered by  the Societies.   Meanwhile, we must continue to  rely on the provision of houses by local authorities.     10.  I  submit for the  consideration of my colleagues, therefore, that the1924 Act subsidy should be  continued in Scotland, but at a reduced rate and for         * That is in areas which are not dealt with as Clearance or Improvement Areas.
 a limited  period say 2 years the subsidy to be restricted to houses which are- erected by local authorities          (1) For the abatement of overcrowding; and         (2) For the accommodation of low wage earners. As regards (2), it is difficult to frame a statutory definition of a low-wage earner, but the end in view might  be secured administratively by confining approval of&quot; schemes to cases where the houses are to be occupied by persons unable to pay, a rent of more than, say 6.?. per week.   With occupiers&apos; rates added, this would mean an inclusive rent of about 8s. per week.     11.   Looking  to present-day building costs and rates of interest, a State subsidy of   9 could not  be defended and I would propose,  therefore, that the subsidy should be of an amount sufficient only  to enable the houses to be let at the rent indicated  in the preceding paragraph.     12.  The average cost of 3-apartment* flatted houses (the most common type of house) erected by local authorities in Scotland during the first nine months of this year was  355.  More recent  information  would appear to indicate that similar houses might now, or in the near future,  be produced at a figure ranging from  300 to  325. Assuming the lower figure  of  300  and interest on the loan (spread over 60 years) at 3-J- per cent., it would, I find, require a State subsidy of  3 17s. 8d. and a local rate contribution of  1 18s.  lOd. for 40  years  to enable the house to be let at the rent which I have suggested.  With money at 4 per cent. the  corresponding figures  would  be   4 15s. 4rf. and  2 7s.  8d.   As I am exceedingly anxious to use every endeavour to  reduce building costs  because it is only in this way that we can hope to return to the position where houses will be produced to be  let at an- economic rent,  I would  be  prepared to restrict the State subsidy to  4 leaving the  local authority  to find  the  balance  of the deficiency.  In &quot; rural  areas,&quot;  as at present defined, where building  costs are higher and where the general level of wages is lower than in the large industrial centres, I would suggest that, following the precedent of  the 1924 and 1930 Acts, the amount of the subsidy might be somewhat higher, say  5 10s.    13.  As indicated,  the reduced  subsidy would be limited to houses  provided by local authorities.  For the reasons stated in the next paragraph, I think the subsidy to private builders for the erection of houses to be let under the  1924 Act should be withdrawn. Apart from one builder in Glasgow who has erected houses in a good residential district, where comparable rents are high, the subsidy has not been taken advantage of to any material extent.                                  1923 Act.    14.  Subsidy under the 1923 Act,  although  withdrawn in England,  is still payable in Scotland at the reduced rate of  4 per house for 20 years.  Local Authorities have now ceased to erect houses under  that  Act, the higher subsidy payable under the  1924 Act having proved more attractive.  Private builders are, however, still applying for the subsidy, and in the year 1931 there were 1,855 houses erected with the aid of  the  subsidy. The Scottish  Committee  on Local Expenditure have recommended that the subsidy should  be withdrawn, a recom-mendation with which I agree.   Having regard to the fall in the cost of building and in the rate of money,  I am of opinion that the subsidy to private builders isno longer justified.  Moreover,  its continuance  would be inconsistent  with thepolicy of endeavouring to stimulate the production of houses by private enterprisewithout State assistance.                              Slum Clearance.    15.   The clearing  away  of   insanitary properties and the  consequent rehousing of the  slum dweller being a  problem of health as well as housing,  is outside  the field  of the ordinary  investor or speculative builder, and must be tackled  by the local authorities.   For  reasons  similar  to  those stated by theMinister of Health, I would propose to make no reduction in the subsidy for slum[7908]* J.e., kitchen and two bedrooms.
-clearance for the present.  In this I am supported by the Scottish Committee on local Expenditure, whose recommendation is as follows :          &apos;&apos; We understand that the rates of subsidy under the Housing (Scotland)     Act, 1930, fall to be reviewed after the 1st October, 1933, and we recommend     that the existing rates should be continued.&quot;                              Rural  Housing.     16.  I agree with the Minister of Health that the subsidy payable under theHousing (Rural  Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931, should be continued.  The induce-ments offered by these Acts have been and still are being largely taken advantageof in Scotland,  and are effecting a much-needed improvement in  the housing accommodation  provided for agricultural workers  and other persons  of  likeeconomic circumstances.   Up to the 30th  September  last 10,373 houses had beenreconditioned, and at that date there were in addition 2,343 houses in course of reconstruction, and 333 houses for  which grants had been  sanctioned, but workthereon had not  commenced.                   Housing  (Rural Authorities) Act, 1931.     17.  I agree with the Minister of Health  that no further subsidies shouldbe allowed under this Act in excess of the maximum of 500 houses to which theGovernment last year restricted the scheme in its application to Scotland.                          Financial Considerations.     18.  The amount of the Exchequer  payments by way  of housing subsidieshas steadily risen and the annual charge  is now  approximately  2,000,000. Theproposed subsidy of  4 per house (in rural areas  5 10s.), will not I think resultin a charge against the  Exchequer of more than  20,000 during each  of the twoyears it will be available, as contrasted with a normal annual increase of  64,800if the 1924 Act  subsidy were continued at its present rate.  The  reduction thuseffected may  conceivably be offset by a corresponding increase in the 1930  ActExchequer contribution  if,  as  is possible,  local  authorities,  owing  to  thediminished subsidy under the 1924  Act, engage more actively  in slum clearance.But an increase in this form of housing activity would meet with general approval.The  abolition of the 1923 and 1924 Act private builders&apos; subsidies will, however,obviate  an otherwise automatic increase in the Exchequer  liability of about 15,000 per annum.  In addition after 1936, when the Housing (Rural Workers)Acts lapse, there will be a similar reduction in normal  increase of  9,000 perannum.  Apart from these economies, it  is not likely that under existing conditions the total amount of State  subsidy will decline materially until 1940 and 1941,when certain loan charges under the 1919  Act will disappear.  By that time also it is hoped that  such progress will have been made in dealing with  the slums asto render further State assistance for that purpose unnecessary.    19.   A reduction of the Exchequer burden in respect of houses erected underthe 1919 Act might be obtained if  action were taken on the lines recommendedbv the Scottish Committee on Local Expenditure and by one of the ConsultativeCouncils of the Department of Health.  Both of those bodies have reported thata considerable number of the houses are  occupied by persons  who are compara-tively well-to-do.  They have, therefore,  recommended that such persons shouldbe given the following options :     (a)  to purchase the house at its current market value;    (b)  to pay an increased rent, as nearly as may be an economic rent at current           prices; or    (c) to quit the house within a reasonable period.    I am having the foregoing recommendation examined in order  to see howfar it may be practicable.   Legislation  would probably be  necessary for  thepurpose of giving full effect to it.
20.  Authority is sought for (a) negotiation with the building societies and the local authorities on lines       indicated in paragraph 9; and (b) introduction of legislation         (i) terminating subsidy under the Acts of 1923 and 1931;       (ii) terminating subsidy under the Act of 1924 so far as payable to             private  builders, and reducing  subsidy  to local  authorities             under that Act to a sum of  4 ( 5  10s.  in rural areas) the             reduced subsidy to  continue for a period of two years; (the             foregoing to be subject to the understanding that, in  practice,             the subsidy will be made  available only  in respect of houses             erected  for the  abatement of  over-crowding and  for  the             accommodation of low wage earners); and       (iii) facilitating the  sale and the letting at a higher rent of houses             erected under the Act of 1919, if on further investigation such             action is found to be practicable.
