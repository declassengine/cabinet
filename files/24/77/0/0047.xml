It is now  certain that tho  Board will  socurfc  the farmadjoining the latter Settlement,  though tho  actual terms havs  not  been definitely  settled.
The difficulty of disposing of potatoes at Holbeach is still acute and a large quantity remains to be despatched.

The Board obtained possession of tho Amesbury Settlement on March 14th, taking over all live and dead stock at a valuation. All the winter crops look exceedingly well and good progress has been made with spring cultivations.

The Rollost?n  and Kelham property, comprising 2,769 acres, has recently been purchased from the British Sugar Boot Growers&apos; Society Ltd., and possession of 2,088 acres will be obtained on April 6th next. The remaining 688 acres are let on tenancies of from 1 to 3 years. It has been decided to re-cast the holdings and to offer 10 of them to existing tenants with a view to their sons, who have been or are shortly to be demobilised, becoming joint holders.

(ii) Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.

Determination of Tenancies. During the week 4 Orders have been made by the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 100 acres. In one case, the Cheshire. Executive Committee reported very adversely upon a dairy farm (51 acres including 16 arable) at High Lane and recommended the determination of the tenancy. The Board caused an inspection to be made by their District Commissioner who new reports that the arable land is very neglected, while the pasture is in poor condition, want of manure for the last 2? years being evident. He also states that the stock is much too small in number for the size of the place.    Altogether he concurs in the opinion of the Committee that in order to allow of this compact and useful holding being run to proper advantage it is necessary that the tenancy should be determined. This has accordingly been done and a suitable tenant has already been scoured by the owner.

The Hereford Committee report that since November 1917 they have had under observation a much neglected holding at Hampton Bishop consisting of 20 acres wnod? by two brothers and an additional 21 acres rented by them.   Cultivation orders have been served by the Committee from time to time but very little effort has over been  made to carry them out. The Committee have therefore suggested to the Board that the tenancy of the 21 acres should be determined as it was considered possible that, relieved of this additional land, the brothers with the help and advice of the Committee might be able successfully to deal with the land owned by them. This recommendation has tho haarty approval of the Board&apos;s commissioner and has accordingly been adopted.            (iii) Provision of Allotments.

Three Local Authorities are at the suggestion of the Board&apos;s Inspectors acquiring under the Cultivation of Lands Order 11\\1//2 acres of land which will provide 156 allotments. Under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 4 Local Authorities are negotiating for 13\\1//2 acres of land in order to be able to provide 202 ... allotments. Eight appeals from allotment holders against notices to quit have recently been received and in each case continuance cf the tenancies has been arranged; the total acreage in question amounted to 11 acres  affecting altogether 152 allotment holders.

(iv) Land Drainage.

In addition to the 10 other counties already referred to in previous reports, an Order has now been made for setting up Drainage Committees in Herefordshire, Huntingdonshire, Flintshire and Glamorganshire.


                      g2 gtira. Itural  D.i.vj.s j on,     ffruit Section,  A representative of the Division attended aposting of&quot;the pruit .,?nd Hop Committee of the Kent Branch of theitfa&apos;tion*l ]?arra*ro&apos; Union ?*nd explained the conditions under which the&quot;Board were preprred to increase its grant to the Wye College FruitResearch Station in order -bo enable the Station fit East Milling toexDend its piro gramme of researoh work,   3he meeting resolved to giveits Buppovt to the scheme and to take steps to raise locally the required capital estimated at  6,100*          Correspondence relating to the economic side of fruitgrowing on small holdings is inoreaeing,  the number of enquiriesreceived averaging 29 weekly.          It has been arranged thnt the question of the importationof fruit and vegetable baskets shall be considered at a meeting ofthe Horticultural Advisory Committee en the 27th instent,\          It is now expected that those Committees which areparticipating in tho Bcnrd&apos;s Bee Restocking a scheme will reeeivedelivery of the stocks from Holland by the end if April.     fimall Live Stock Section.  The Australian Amny Authorities are giving courses of instruction in Poultry keeping to their men priorto their return, and the Board have been asked for assistance.Leaflets dealing with the subject have been sent and Arrangements havebeen mnde for parties to be conducted over large poultry farms, inorder that the men may learn how operations are carried on in thiscountrye     Instruction and Advice.   A visit has been paid to the Allotmentsin Leicestershire, which were found  to be in good condition anti workedon the best lines,          The question  of neglected  orchards is being vigorouslydealt with by the Warwickshire Horticultural Sub-Committee, but lackof labour has proved a  stumbling block, as prunere &apos;re very scarce^Owners fve reported as being v^ry willing to pay mere attention totheir orchard8 ae soon  a8 labour can be obtained.          At Middlesborough  (Yorkshire) where the allltmentorganisation is very  strong  instruction has bean asloet for and gfcven^on &quot;Artificial Manuring&quot;.                        Jeehnioal Division.     Sowing Down to Sr^ss.   , At the invitation of the principal ofthe east Anglian Institute of Agriculturo, a visit was paid to a fatapn the London Clay near Mf*ldon and  ndviee given as to suitablemixtures of S&apos;ir4e for leys of six or morn ye^rB1 duration.   The faroin question has contributed  its due  share of the County quota broken up for corn, and while  the occupier intends to put  the new groundthrough nn nrable rotation,  he is compelled by labour shortage andthe difficulties and  risks incidental to farming this olass of land o replace some of the  old gr*B8 by new pastures,     Smnortrnco of Lime on fonden Clay.   Ihe farm above referred tois rented at 6/- an acre  and comprises about 1101 *orca, mootly onthe London Clry.   It is  interesting as *n example of whf-t tan bedone, even with the moet  intractable sell, by * farmer endowed withihr r^quisit? skill,  enterprise and capital.   The  staple product ofthe ? r/ble lr.nd is whent, of which  the average yield is about 4 qrs.per aore*   Lrst year,  however, 6 qxs. were obtained.   Beans andclover r.ro -1st grown successfully  and a  special  feature is made ofpicking peas which last year returned at  the rate of  85. per acre.
Even at £13 an acre, a figure not uncommon in normal times, peas were regarded as a paying crop. A head of 50 milking ? is kept; draught houses are b?ed in large numbers and sheep are fattened off on green crops during the summer months. Most of the land, both grass and arable, has been mole-drained&apos; slag has been used with good effect on the outlying meadows, while the home pastures, enriched  by cow-feeding, ?ve a luxuriant mat of pereurial rye-grass and white clever. But the most striking example of improvement is that off eff? the use of Lime on the arable land. Fields that have been limed are friable, tilthy and dry, while unlimed fields alongside are beaten dawn by the rains, are ?, sticky and unworkable. Harrowing for peas was proceeding on the field, half of which had been limed, the other half unlimed. On the former a good impression was being made,  on the latter the marks of the harrows were ?ccely visible. Lime has been used in the form of gas-lime (15 l?ads per acre, at 1/10 a l?ad). ?lk (15 l?ads per acre), and quiclalime (3 tons per acre at 30/. pet/ ton). All  forms have been effective but the last-named has proved quickest in action.

Plant Discases.- Tomato Foot Rot. This disease, which is comparatively new, has become more plentiful and widespread each year. It is caused by the fungus Phytonhthora O?ptogaee which causes a ?ot of the seller and the root system and is responsible for the loss of many thousands of seedlings. The only method of prevention  at present known is to raise the plants in soil thoroughly sterilised by heat and to use only uncontaminated water.

Complaints ? onions decaying through attacks of Botrytis cinevea have been unusually prevalent this winter.   In some cases whole crops have been lost. Since the attacks are largely owing to the poorly ripened state ? the bulb, the importance of doing everything possible to secure proper ripening is most apparent.

Samples of flax seed received from the Seed Testing Station showed the presence of Colietotri?hum fungi, Which hibernate the soed coat and the disease is thus transmitted to the seedling. The disease is probably widespread, as the fungus was present in all the samples examined. It has been shown that treating slighly moistened seed with a mixture of finely powdered copper sulpha to crystals and dry ammonium ?bonate prevents the disease entirely.

Labour Division.

Training of Ex-Service Men. The Scheme for the training and placing in employment of ex-Service men who desire to obtain agricultural work, whether with a view to obtaining ultimately holdings of their own or not, has now been issued to all Agricultural Executive Committees. It is intended to set up draining Centres as required in various parts of country, each Centre to servo one or more counties. Most of the Training Centres will be under the management of the Agricultural Executing Committee of the county in which they are situated and  these committees will also be responsible for placing the men in employment at the expiration of the period of training.

An additional 20 ex-Service men were sent to be Tractor Training school at Brentwood, Essex, during the week  the number of men now under training at this School being 50. Several other Centres have been selected at which training ? be commended immediately hunting accommodation has been obtained.


Demobilisation. A further 12,441 agriculturists were demobilised during the seven days ended 19th March,  

? the total number of  such men released up to that date being 166,308.  The rate of release has still further  decreased and it is now rather less than 2,000 men per day.

The Board have obtained  particulars from the Ministry of Labour of  all men in receipt of Unemployment Donation who are alleged to be agriculturists and the County Agricultural Executive Committees have been instructed to arrange with the local  Employment Exchange Manager for these men to be offered agricultural  employment with a farmer in the county in need of labour.

Soldier, Labour. An additional 2,422 soldiers pf Agricultural Companies were demobilised during the we?, making the total number of men released from these Companies to date 44, 056.

Women&apos;s Branch.

The returns from the various counties show that the demand for women is not as ?oute as it was a month ago, except for milkers and horsewomen.  Th?ve are a certan number off field workers unemployed which is probably due to the exceptionally bad weather, and it is anticipated they will be absorbed as soon as the spring work can begin.

The demand for women will probably increase rapidly at short notice when the work is actually waiting to be done. Past experience has proved the difficulties of supplying from the Land Army the farmers&apos; needs on such occasions, as it is not possible to keep tho women in depot indefinitely ponding employment.

An increasing number of women who were released from the Land Army during the winter are applying to be re-enrolled. In cases where they ave re-accepted by the Selection Board these women should form useful labour.

The folowing is one among many ?noouraging reports of the work done by the women. A Sussex farmer decided at the end of last December to dispense with his common and run his sheds entirely with fund Army Girls. He was formerly very scooptioal about woman labour, but now would not alter his present arrangements.

Cultivation Division.

Tractor Work. During the week ended 7th March, 5050 acres were ploughed, 19 Acres were acres ploughed Ahli 323 acres were cultivated.

372 Dryer work was done by tractors on threshing etc, ?.  Sales have, been held in Cheshire, Devon, Essex, Hereford, Kent, Leicester. Monmouth, Montgomery, Nottinghamshire, Sussex (West), Yorkshire (East and North Ridings). Prices realised were satisfactory in all cases, more especially in Essex where Fordson Tractors and Oliver Ploughs realised as much as £257.

Exceptionally good prices have been obtained during the week for horses sold - especially at Lo?s where 18 horse  made an average of  £101 and at Otley where 23 horses averaged £92. The total number of horses sold during the week is 176 at an average of £72.

Steam Tackle. The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows:- ploughed 443\\1//2, cultivated 70,  total 5131\\1//2 acres.

It was agreedthat supplies should be made available for pumping, though in viewof the demands of vital servioes of a more immediate nature itwas not considered that much could be made available for ploughing.As regards threshing no ease for priority oan bejnade out sineethere are large stocks of wheat and flour in hand at the ptesenttime,-                    Commercial Division,     fertilisers.   She Ministry of Munitions h*ve new issued a notice stating that the control over Sulphate of Ammonia,Superphosphate and Basic Slag will be withdrawn as from the 31stMay next and that matters connected with the distribution of theeefertilisers will in future be. dealt with by the Departments if&apos;Agriculture,   Arrangements are being made With the representativesof the three trades with a view to securing agreement as te theprices to be charged for fertilisers next yOar, and as regards their method of distribution.   The Basic Blag Trade toreunanimously agreed that the arrangements fair last year should beoontinued with an increase in price of enly 2/- per ton,   Thisarrangement is being incorporated in an Agreement between theBe rd and the manufacturers.   The circumstances connected withthe Superphosphate and Sulphate of Ammonia trades present greaterdifficultiee than Basic Slag, but it is hoped that it will bepossible to make similar arrangements,          Jt is important that -measures should be taken toprevent dislocation on the removal of control, as there is a danger that farmers and dealers will be disinclined ts buy inthe expectation of lower prioes, while the makers in the absence$f orders will cease manufacture and close their works,     Iforketinq,  The methods of marketing fruit and vegetablesin this country are being investigated with a view to some definite &apos;:otion by the Board in the near future.   Complaints ofthe present methods have bean rife fer some years and improvementmust ne doubt be a gradual process.   With the co-operation andgood will of the trade this should not be-; impossible.     Binder Twine.  With a. view to preventing unemployment in this trade all possible steps are being taken to encourage export.The makers are pressing the Board to prohibit import frem Americabut it ie doubtful whether it will be possible to take this step in view of the assurances that have been given to films in thisoountry that th-ypill be allowed to import certain definitequantities.   The demand at present is very poor, both farmers and dealers holding off buying.     ?art Disease of Pttatpes.

Judged by ordinary standards the yields are not high, but these may baexplained in the first place by the fact that the acreages are givenin gross, whereas the margins and waste in connection with most of these fields has been very considerable.   Apart from this it should be mentioned that this large acreage cf corn has been secured in the mainfrom fields that have been oropped with corn until the last point ofproduction has been reached.   If the food situation had been less serious last spring quite 30$ of this corn land would have been bare-fall owe d*          Besides getting a very fair corn crop from all this land, the fields, without exception, are far cleaner than on taking over the land,and under average conditions will give an increased return from now onwards.

The Land Reclamation Branch-will move this week from Great ? llege Street, Westminster, to 6, St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. and arrangements are being made far the early removal of other branches to at building. This will afford a certain amount of relief to several ?isions, but the general position of the Board as regards office ?ommadation remains extremely unsatisfactory and it is-quits possible to carry on effectivently the greatly  expanded business of ? Department under existing conditions.

In the final report of the Committee on Organisation and ?ffing of Government Offices(Cd: 62) which has just been issued, ?cial attention is called to the necessity for the provision of gentrated accommodation if the business of Government Departments is he carried, on efficiently. The need for this so far as this, ?rd is concerned has existed for the last twenty-five years, but late years has become much more serious and has now become very ?te.  It seems imperative that the Board should have restored to them ? the earliest date the building in Whitehall Place (Armament Building), ?ch was specially built for this Department.
