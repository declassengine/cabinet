(1)  Special Aural Board&quot;for -S.7^Area.  Aural Boards are held atBristol, Exeter and Plymouth.  Prom their inception early in 1918they have examined 297 men.  Of these men 203, or nearly 70 per  cent,were In employment.  95, or 30 per cent were recommended for lip-reading instruction.  The. reports as to lipreading are not satisfac-tcry as not only is it difficult to induce men to attend classes butthe facilities for instruction are limited.     (2)  Special Aural Board, Brighton -  From its commencement  inMarch, 1918&quot;, this Board has examined&quot;97 men.  Between 70 and 30  percent cf the men examined were in work.  47, or 50 per cent, wererecommended
1 Commended for lip reacting but  only  ll  nave  tanen advantage  of  theBournes of instruction  provided  as their  ordinary wage  is  more  than jbe maintenance allowance granted am the men  fear that they will fiot recover their  job at the  end of  the course.

The bason given for1 this, is that at first  many  men y;ere  earning good sages in munition  factories and  diet  not care to throw up such well paid  jobs whilst novj they are in receipt  of  unemployment allowance and do not care to employ their  leisure in being  instructed.      (4)  Cpecial  Aural Bydard for East  Angli&amp;Jc South Midlands.   From larch, 1918*&quot;to&quot;the&quot;&apos;end&apos;&quot;of FeBruary,&quot;&quot;1919, TI8  men were  exaiiiiied by this  Board.  Of these men 80  per cent were in  employment and 53 or  45 per cent were recommended for lipreading  instruction.  So  far,  owing to the difficulty  of providing  instructors,  no lipreading  classes have 3een  formed.      (5)  Special  Aural Board SoE. and  Central scotland.  From February, 1918,&quot;H2&quot;5 men have&apos;been examinee&apos;&quot;&quot;by  this Board.  86 men were recommended for lipreading, of Mtltom*  41 have attended or are attending instruction classes..

The January, 1919, issue of the &quot;Veteran&quot; raisesa protest against 9 practice, which appears  to  beprevalent in some quarters, of offering lower wages tomen in receipt of a Government pension,  Thic practice isin direct contravention of the principle laid down bothby members of the Cabinet and by the appointed officials of the Board of Pensions, namely, that each pension  isawarded aolely on the basis of decrease of pre-war earn-ing capacity and that it should never be considered as a factor in relation to the future wages which the pensionedman might be able to earn,          &quot;The Veteran&quot; declares It to be imperative that not only members of the Great War Veterans1 Association,but also Trades Unionists should take the matter up, and prevent the establishment of the principle of  takingpensions into aocovint in fixing wages.  With this objectit invites any pensioned msn who, on account of  his pension, is offered by on employer a lower wage than thestandard rate, to communicate particulars p,ith a view totheir being given the widest publicity.

It was  resolved to urge upon the Dominion Parliament (1) the necessity ofan immediate adjustment of the pensions to meet the depreciation in the purchasing power of the dollar; (2)that greater authority to determine the pension shouldbe vested in competent local boards, so as to enablethem to relievo evident cases of hardship and to  makeadditional provision for widows in ill-health or  withsickly children; and (3) the provision of Governmenthouses for the widows and children of those who havefallen in the war, and for soldiers, sailors and  nurses.

\APPENDIX  XI.FRANCE:   The Return to the Land of partially disabled men.          The International Review of Agricultural Economics,published in Rome,  for August, 1919, gives an account of thework done in France by the Department of Agricultural labour at the Ministry of Agriculture to induce partially disabled mento return to the land.  The work consists in active propaganda,and In providing facilities for settling men on the land          The propaganda is carried on by means of posters, arajphlets and cinematograph films.  Ken may apply to  the epartment of Agricultural Labour for information regardingschools of re-education for agricultural trades of which an up to date list is kept.  Apprenticeship bursaries  havebeen instituted to enable farmers to take partially disabledmen for a course of practical training either after theyhave left the school of re-education or Instead of the schoolceurse.          The Department is kept informed of small farms tobe let or sold; so that It Is In a position to  give information on this point to those who wish to settle on afarm, but have no property in view.  It also gives  ln-forrrmtion as to facilities in the matter of credit on realestate.          Another useful branch of the worlr of the Depart-raent is that ^hich consists in advising makers of the bestkind of agricultural machines for the use of the partiallydisabled.          &quot;To direct the **ork of country bred disabled mentowards agricultural occupations, and to facilitate  forthe?n by every poesible means the realisation of a plan whichthey have been induced to form; such is, in brief,  theprogramme of the Department of agricultural Labour&quot;,

An advisory  body  has also been  appointed tiled   &quot;The   Central  Funds  representative ommittee&quot;  to  assist in  the administration d  to  ensure  that  those  for whom  and by bom these funds have been  contributed have voice in their distribution. The Committee includes three representatives ran each of the eight commands, at least one of ihom  must  be from warrant or other ranks sleeted  from  warrant  officers,  N.C.O.S  and fen. It  will be of interest to our  readers to knowlat this body has decided to proceed at once with scheme for setting up  Clearing Centres  for lildren  in each command  area, intended  pri- arily for  the  total  orphans of men who have ;st  their lives  in the war, and  also  for the other less  children of serving men.  They will i available,  however, not only  for  soldiers&apos; lildren, but for the motherless children of any man who has lost his life or is still serving inother branches  of  His Majesty&apos;s Forces.  It is  estimated that each Centre shall accom-accommodate from forty to fifty children.  As a preliminary step  committees  are  nowin process  of- formation in each command area which  will include  representatives of  all  ranks and  of ex-service  men,  women with  special experience,  and two representatives  (one man and  one woman) of  the Ministry of Pensions.  Another  proposal which  has been taken up bythe representative  Committee  with enthusiasmis one to make special provision for any of thesechildren who  are  suffering  from  tuberculosiseither in its initial  or advanced stages.  Negotiations  are already proceeding  which, itis hoped,  will  result in the acquisition of  an existing group of buildings on an ideal site whichhas  been  equipped  for this  very purpose  and where   the  children  would  receive  the  bestmedical attention combined with open-air educa-tion  and training for employment.  It is not  possible  at the  present stage to give further  details of these two important proposals,but further information as soon as it is availablewill  be  given in the GAZETTE.  To those of our readers  who  are aware of the urgent need that exists for temporary accommo-dation for  motherless, children,  pending arrange-ments for finding them a more permanent home,it will  come as a great relief to know  that  theprovision of these Centres, so often advocated, isnow in a  fair way  to be  accomplished, and itwill  be  generally agreed that the Central FundsCommittee have been well  advised in putting theneeds of the children first.  Mr. F. S. Pelly is acting as  Secretary of theArmy Children&apos;s Homes,  and  communicationsshould  be addressed to British Columbia House,1, Eegent  Street, W.

There is no  doubt that the  need is  as great, ifnot greater, now than at any period of the war.                       -o- - The second question raises a difficult  point affecting  notonly voluntary  workers but also  those receiving a salary                 upon which they are not dependent.  No    Voluntary    one  in such a position would desire to     Workers.    stand in the way of  another with equal                 qualifications for a post  which affordedgood  prospects  of permanent employment.  At the sametime it must  be remembered that many, if not most, of the positions filled by voluntary workers cannot be so described ;that after peace there will be a steady reduction  of eniploy-ment;  and that it is not work which  can  be  learned ina few  days.  After all, the work&apos;s the  thing, and whetherthe worker is paid or unpaid, man or  woman, young or old,matters little in comparison.  The first response to  the  suggestion contained in ourleading article last month has been very encouraging.  Mr.                 G. B. Buckley, of the Disabled Soldiers    The  Lucky    Aid Committee, 40, Ebury  Street, has    Handicap.    been kind  enough  to hand to us a great                  mass of  letters written by men, trainedunder Dr. Walmesly and Mr. Denton at the NorthamptonPolytechnic  Institute,  Clerkenwell,  as  Electrical  power station attendants, and now in permanent  situations.   an account of the work  at Clerkenwell was given in one of ourearliest numbers.   In calling  attention to extraordinary success in  isolatedinstances there may  perhaps be a danger of misleading the                  average man,  but  these  letters show by   Pleasure and   their  numbers  that  here  is a career       Profit.     which the average man has found not                  only profitable, but of supreme interest. The following sentence from a letter requires no comment: &quot; You have given me something which really interests me, and I intend to  work on and try and take my A.M.I.E.E.&quot;  Another man writes that he has recently bought a iS&quot; Hawkin&apos;s Electrical Guides &quot; at the price of JGB,    m  A third says; &quot; I  find my disablement very little lificap.  It was awkward at first, but my artificial handfifbecome so useful that I can do anything that is retmirjfme in this particular job.&quot;                         I;  &apos;  It  is a  matter  for regret that we  must add  thiQvacancies  in this  branch of the electrical industry areunlimited.

Pensions nnay  now be  granted  to parents under throecategories:     (i) Parents  of  men under the  age of  a6 at the       outbreak of  War, or date of joining for Service,       if later.         Pensions not exceeding 5s. weekly may be granted       provided that:           (a.) The man was unmarried,          (b) He  has  left  no child or other dependant               in receipt  of  or eligible for Separation               Allowance  or pension.         Pension will have effect from the first pension pay       day in  November (provided the man would  then       have  attained the age of 18 years) if  application is       made by the 81st January, 1919.  After that date       pension will not be granted for any period prior to       the date of application.    (2) Parents of men  who were contributing to their       parents&apos;  support  before the  outbreak of war,       or date of joining for Service, if later.         Pensions equal to&apos; the amount of pre-war depen-       dence but not less than 3s. 6d. (or 5s. if eligible for       that  rate  under Category 1) and not  exceeding 15s.       a week, may  be granted.         If  two. or more sons  have been killed and there       are two surviving parents their cases may be con-       sidered separately, and pensions granted up to the       maximum of  80s. weekly for the two parents.    (3) Parents  who  are  incapable  of   self-support       through  infirmity  or age and in  pecuniary       need.         Pensions of not less than 3s. 6d. and not exceed-       ing 15s. a week m*y be granted according to the       circumstances of the case.   Pensions under Cate-       gories 1 and 2 may be  increased if  conditions of       Category 3 are fulfilled.         If  Separation Allowance or pension is being paid       no special application  will  be required in cases       under 1 and  2.   The necessary forms will be sent       to the parents in due course by the  Officer paying       Separation Allowance or  by the Ministry of^ Pen-       sions.  If no Separation Allowance  or pension is       being paid application is necessary and should  be       addressed to  the  Secretary, Local War Pensions       Committee,  who will issue the requisite forms.         Applications for pension under Category 3 may be       made to the  Secretary, Local War Pensions Com-       mittee, at any time that the circumstances of the       parents justify consideration for a grant.         For the purpose  of pension  the term &quot;parent&quot;       includes, besides a natural parent or a blood relative       who has stood  in the place of a parent, any other       person who  has wholly or mainly maintained the       man at his (or her) own expense for at least a year       at some time before the commencement of the War.         Except as  stated in Category 2, the highest pen-       sion  on one  or more sons payable to a parent or       parents is 15s. weekly.

             The  Pensions  Lady.   Is it generally realised how rapidly each Pension Office has become a social centre ?   On the Pensions Committees depend not  only j, the individual happiness  of thousands, but also  to  a  great  extent the national well-being.   To their doors come men and women of all ages and in almost every phase of emotional feeling ; the broken, the  bereaved, and  men who have  clearly given heroic  service,  yet obviously tremble at the ordeal  before them;&apos; for it must be understood that every man still receiving either full ox- partial disablement  pay receives  this  from   the local Pensions  Committee.  It is  a good plan, a&apos;s it enables those  interested in a man&apos;s  welfare to  keep in friendly touch with him and  give him that advice and assistance which the Post Office officials  cannot give.   In unobtrusively listening  to  the conversation  of  the group attached to  a  Centre I will call &quot; 0,&quot; I was greatly struck by the  very unusual relationship  that I  found in almost every case  existing between the  older applicants and a Mrs. R., whom I  afterwards learned Was  secretary to the committee.   &quot; You leave it to, &apos;er &quot; the advice given to a downcast  man who expressed  great  scepticism as to whether he would  get a pension at all-&quot;same as I did.&quot; &quot;They sez to me  up at  London, you  ain&apos;t got  no claim, you&apos;d better take a gratooity; but I takes them  papers to &apos;er, and I  shows &apos;er me  medals and me certifs, and soon as she sees them she was  on to  &apos;em like  a terrier; she  sez &apos; I&apos;ll fight it for you,1 and &quot; dramatic pause-&quot; I gets it.&quot;   Even more important than the personnel of the  Pensions Committee is the personality of the committee&apos;s secretary. The ordinary official is worse than useless.  The girl clerk&apos;s inexperience of life, immaturity of judgment, and natural disposition to look  at things lightly, make her as great a danger as  the bureaucrat, male or female, whose ideal is to run the whole thing &quot; as a business department&quot; on rigidly official lines. Upon the secretary depends the attitude of everybody applying for a pension, and it is the impressions that they carry away which will ultimately stamp them- selves upon  the immediate district.  Reproduce this all over the country, and you will  see that it is no exaggeration to say that the Pensions Committees will enormously  affect the national feeling of the country.  A man  who leaves  the office convinced that something more than the most bare justice will  be  meted out to him, that as an individual human being he is of interest and concern to those in whose hands his fate lies to a large extent, will create  more good feeling and obliterate more sense of wrong than would a hundred pamphlets or debates in the House of Commons.  The  greatest  possible  care should be  taken to  select a secretary known ill the district and liked.  Mrs. R., in &quot; C &quot; district, owes the success that she  has had from the very beginning  largely to the fact that she worked for  the &quot; Soldiers&apos;  and Sailors&apos;  Families Association &quot; and knew  the women  in their homes.  It is not, of course,  always  possible  to  make so felicitous a choice as  that  of Mrs. R., whose cheerful, hopeful work is carried  on  in  a whitewashed shed-like  annexe to the elementary  school;  but  anything  that  in the   remotest degree associates the Pensions with  charity is wrong, andis deeply resented.   &quot; You come here as a right,&quot;  were the first words that fell  on my ear, and they are the keynote ofthe spirit  in which  the work is done.  Contrast this withthose words overheard while chatting to  some applicantsat the second Centre, &quot; X.&quot; : &quot; She treats us  as if we wasPore Lor persons,&quot; and it would take the pen of a Swift  topaint the intense bitterness of the speakers expression.  The  conception alas !  still widely prevalent that the sole duty  of the Pension secretary consists in  &quot;taking down&quot; tho  applicants  &quot;case,&quot;  and &quot;putting  it,&quot; j documented, before the committee, is likely to create .ugliest form of Socialism  ; whereas, rightly conceived work really.means nothing less than a social reyoliijj The public is  almost entirely ignorant of the very aia help that is offered to-day, and of the numerous forms takes  in  the hands  of  an intelligent,  feeling secreta under the  auspices of a committee willing  and anxious do its best to repair and reconstruct.  Mrs. R, told raeJj it is most rare  for a pension to be withheld, if there ill smallest shadow of claim for its being granted; and um the skilful handling of a secretary many facts and circu stances are elicited which the applicant might feel rolucta to state.  The  full disablement pay of 27s. 6d. a week granted with a  great deal of latitude, and wherever the cs ultimately presents any  difficulty  it is  again review The best medical  treatment is secured for a man after I discharge, and  this is prolonged until he is perfectly w and able to resume his own occupation, or if unable to this trained for something more appropriate.   To give an instance, there is a young man, an in-patie at one  of. the civil  hospitals, who, having  had both his le amputated, will come into ordinary life again able to ea . 3 3s. a week, at cigarette making, which he had be taught immediately  on discharge.  Again, the local coi mittee, being in touch with the man, is  able to decide consultation with  the medical  authority-if his  health not progressing satisfactorily, and special boards have bei appointed to deal with this condition, meanwhile allowii the pension to be. increased by the local committee. Agai take the case of  an  elderly woman whose-daughter dii suddenly,  and whose son-in-law at  the  Front,  unable come home, was obliged to leave his three tiny children ( her hands.  The  allowance regularly paid  her  is onlj small part of the help that the Pension people have gin her; she has been put into the way of obtaining there assistance offered by the Civil Liabilities Commission, ai homes of a safe and excellect kind have been found for tl little children, who are kept together and boarded near he Here, I venture  to think,  is reconstruction of  the fine kind.  Take  another case. The secretary&apos;s quick eye notiei some gaping spaces where teeth ought to be.  &quot; Why, wl has happened to your teeth&apos;?&apos;&apos;  she asks.  Reply, &quot; Oh, tin took &apos;em out in the Army.&quot;  &quot;Well, didnVthey put ne ones in ? &quot; &quot; No.&quot;   And although the youth has interview countless  authorities  and boards,  it never seems to hai occurred to anyone that  his  digestion  is  being ruirit Secretary gives him  an &quot; Ivory Cross &quot; letter and inform the blushing boy that he will look twice as handsome wht he has  got his  teeth.  The secretary here sees every on herself, and if there, is. any  hardship involved in waiting it the pension the committee advance  the necessary mone; There are all sorts of  funds working with the committee- maintenance, training,  &amp;c.;  and  I cannot  believe  ftthere is  a  single man or woman in  this  district who danot go  away from that office lighter  of heart and fuller i hope for the. future.

Circular 138.-Appeal in Oases  of&apos; Award  of      Pension  on Ground of  Under-assessment.   In future, every discharged man who claims that the degree of his disability hits beon undor-assessed, and that the pension awarded to him is not appro- priato to the degree of his real disablement, will have the right to have his appeal forthwith considered by tho Medical Referee and reported.by the Local  Committee to the Ministry,  provided that no man shall exercise this right more than once in the interval between two Medical Boards, though tho Local  Committee may consider his case again if they see just cause.   In the event of the Medical Refereo certifying that the disability has been under-assessed, the Local Committee  is now authorised to extend  the powers givon  by Circular 70, so as to meet tlie  case, and (pending examination by a Medical Board and a decision by tho Ministry on his case) to make recoverable advances to an  amount equivalent to  the difference between tho pension based  on the degree of disability eommunicated to the Local Committee by the Ministry and the  pension corresponding to the degree of disability as assessed by the Medical  Referee.   In all cases particular caro should bo taken to make quite clear to the man that :-     (n)  If the opinion of tho  Medical  Referee is upheld when the man is          eventually re-boarded, the advances  made  will  represent the          appropriate  increase of pension for the weeks in respect of which          they were paid ; but     (6)  If the Medical Referee&apos;s opinion is not sustained on re-boarding, the          advances made will have to  be recovered by small instalments from          future issues of pensions ; and     (c)  No recommendations will bo put forward by the Local  Committee          for reviewof pension by the  Ministry unless the Medical Referee          after examination certifies  that  in his opinion the assessment is          under-estimated.

Procedure  for dealing  with    supplementary  estimates of  administrative  expenses of    Local Committees for the remainder of the financial year    ending March 31, 1919.   Under the provisions of ihe War Pensions (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1918, the administrative  expenses of Local and Joint  Committees, instead of being defrayed in part by the Local  Authorities and in  part by the State, shall, as from January 1, 1919,  be  mot  entirely out of moneys provided by Parliament. This circular indicates in detail the procedure to be adopted in the submission of these estimates. Dec.  19th.   Circular  140. Readmission  of  Discharged    Disabled Soldiers to Military  and Auxiliary Hospitals.   Special attention is  called to this  Circular.  It has been arranged by  the Military Authorities that Military and Auxiliary Hospitals shall again under- take to re-admit as In-patients discharged disabled men, in any case in which treatment is certified to be necessary  for a disability due  to wound or injury sustained in Military Service and requiring surgical  (including orthopaedic) treatment.   Committees  should accordingly ascertain from the Deputy Director or the Assistant Deputy Director of Medical Services for the area, the names of the Military Hospitals under his control to which such eases  may be referred for In-patient treatment. Dec. 30th.   Circular 141. War Bonus on Pensions.&apos;   This circular amplifies the particulars given in our last issue.   Local Committees may pay the bonus with any arrears  due in treatment or training cases forthwith, but payment by the Pension Issue Office in ordinary pension  cases  must for administrative reasons be spread over three months, i.e., each case will be dealt with in ordinary course as it comes up for renewal of the  book of thirteen weekly payments.  The full amount of arrears due will be paid with the  first issue of pension in the new book of  allowance forms.   It is recognised that there will be exceptional cases of illness or misfortune where hardship will result unless arrears are paid at an early date, and if the Local  Committee will notify the pension lssuo Office of  any such case steps will at once be taken to deal with it specially.   Awards of pension will still be made at the rates shown in the Royal Warrant, and these rates will continue to bo stated on the Identity Certificates. The weekly amounts authorised on  the new books of allowance forms sent to the Post Office will, however, include the addition of the bonus, and payment of the latter will be made with the pension although not shown on the Identity Certificates.   Recoverable advances made by Local Committees should be at the ordinary pension rate without bonus.   It has come to the notice of the Ministry that money isnow being collected from  various sources  for the  supplyof  invalid  chairs  and  tricycles  to disabled  soldiers  whohave lost  their limbs.   It should be generally known  thathand-propelled tricycles for  outdoor use, and  light  Merlinchairs  for indoor use, are supplied under the orders of theMinistry at  the public  expense in all  cases of amputationof both legs, and also  in paralytic cases where  the man&apos;shealth is such that  he is able to make use of them, and isunder the necessity of using them.
