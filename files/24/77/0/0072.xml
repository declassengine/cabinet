PART I.-LABOUR DIFFICULTIES ARISING FROM GOVERNMENT  CONTROL,                    WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE RAILWAYS.    The  two most recent disputes of importance in the Labour World were both settled by negotiation with the head of the Government.  This, fact is one of considerable signi-significance, and the course of negotiations connected with the demands of the railwaymen and Miners  serves to bring  out very  clearly the  difficulties that are emerging from certain of the new phases which, industrial bargaining is reaching.    Two weeks ago Part I of this Report referred to the difficulties in dealing with labour disputes experienced by the Government, arising from the fact that Governmental inter-vention can only take place when a deadlock  has arisen between  the parties concerned.This does not  mean, however, that in cases where the Government own or control an industry there are not also difficulties to be met.  The difficulties here are different, but in thepresent stage at any rate, they are as great if not greater than is the case where the Govern-ment does not stand in the relation of employer to the workpeople.  The Labour historyof the past few months, and more especially the most recent negotiations with the  rail-waymen, serve to bring  this out with peculiar sharpness, and  to  illustrate the types of difficulty involved.    These may perhaps  be conveniently divided under three heads.   In the first place the same difficulty is apt to arise as occurs in the case of the private employer, but in some-  (0 1729) 140  4/19  H k I
  thing&apos;  of  an aggravated form,.  The  process whereby,  when  negotiations between  the .executive Department and the meiVs unions have broken-down, the War Cabinet steps in,  is in essence similar to that whereby when negotiations between private  employers  and  the  men&apos;s unions have broken down  the Government steps in.  There is  one important  difference however.   Whereas in the  latter case the Government is free to act as a per-  perfectly  neutral party, in the former, the. War Cabinet cannot pretend to be entirely aloof  from the actions already taken by the  executive Department concerned, since ft is morally responsible for them and  to some extent therefore tied by them.  This difficulty, while  it has  always been latent,  has never.assumed the prominence which it has recently, partly because direct Government control before the war covered&apos;so much more limited a field, and partly because it is only comparatively recently that the rnens unions have been strong enough to force the issue up to the Cabinet&quot;.&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;There&quot;seerfis&apos; little doubt, however, that more and  more,this kind of thing will tend  to occur in the,future, unless something is done to make it unnecessary/                                       ,:&apos;      The second difficulty  is olosoiy-conuected, -with......the foregoing  and arises from  the amount of time which, under conditions such as are alluded to above, the supreme executive body of the Government has to give to  industrial negotiations, on what after all, though they may be matters of principle, are nevertheless merely matters of principle regarding&apos; the&apos; detailed working of a  single industry.  This defect in the present system is  well illustrated in the latest interview between the Government and the  Railwaymen.  It has come to the fore, like the previous one, largely through the greatly enhanced power of the large unions ;  this has created an entirely novel situation, in which the men&apos;s bargain- ing strength is so great, and the threat of a strike so serious, that any point of  detail which the men are restive about becomes of an importance and urgency warranting its being carried to the highest  authority which alone  can take the responsibility of giving a ruling. on it.  The last difficulty is really the most fundamental, and in essence embraces the other, two.  It. arises from the anomalous position in which any Governmental Executive is bound  to  find itself which  has to carry  on an industry  as well as perform the  ordinary executive functions of Government.  The executive machine was never intended for such a purpose, and it involves the Government in a dual function which is bound to be unsatis- factory.  If the Government is one party to a dispute it cannot act at the same ;time as supreme  and independent  arbitrator  between  the parties.   One  aspect of the possible results of this unsatisfactory state of affairs is seen in the political resolutions relating to conscription and intervention in Russia passed by the miners at the same time as they accepted the adjustment of their industrial demands offered by the Government. . Though the Miners&apos; Federation,  more than any other large organisation probably, is  apt to drag their political aims into their industrial negotiation, and too much therefore need not be made of these resolutions, the incident illustrates the sort of position in which  a Govern-. mental Executive might conceivably find itself through trying to act at once  as supreme authority and as one party to industrial negotiations.     The history of the  recent negotiations  with the railwaymen again is an excellentillustration of this ;  and as it is likely that it is in connexion with the railways that theproblems raised by these considerations ivill first have to be worked out and an eventualsolution arrived at, it may be worth while to take this  industry as a concrete exampleand make  some observations regarding methods of meeting the difficulties  referred to in special connexion with it.    In  the event  of nationalisation  as generally understood, there would  seem to be a danger that the railway management may concede the demands of the workers too easily,in the absence of the profit  motive which  forms a sufficient check in the case  of the privateemployer.   Railway workers are not more selfish than others;   but wages are a matterof degree.   There is no absolute standard of fairness, no scientific method of determiningwages, and there is always the danger already alluded to that the railwaymen may use theirmonopoly to exact rather more than the  trade will bear, and force the matter right up tothe supreme authority, and take up time  that should be otherwise spent, in the process.    In the recent negotiations, leaving  aside &quot;the  fairness or otherwise of the railwaymen&apos;demands, this has happened, and yet,  it is to be noticed, no final settlement as regardswages was involved in the very protracted negotiations that took place, but only a modus vivendi that put off for the time being the solution of questions which, however, are boundto come up for definite solution sooner or later.    It would therefore seem to be unsatisfactory to place on the management the whole burden  of deciding when a wages demand should be conceded and when resisted.  Theywould be constantly between the Scylla  of undue concessions, which would be unfair tothe community,  and the Charybdis of undue resistance to the men&apos;s claims, which would
be unfair to the latter, and, by producing constant friction, detrimental to the efficiency of the service.  In addition, as already pointed out, when the State becomes the employer,it loses its moral authority as supreme and impartial arbitrator.     A possible way out of these difficulties has been suggested by the fact that the questionof wages and other expenses is  really a question between the railway workers and therailway users.  It has accordingly been proposed that they  could best be settled by a&quot;joint authority representative of these two interests and of no one else.  Such a scheme,it is to be noted, does not involve the question of &quot; control &quot; in the technical sense.  Theactual management and  detailed direction might be in the hands of permanent officials.only, or  &quot;joint,&quot; i.e., containing a direct labour element.  The important point  is thatassociated with the Minister and managing staff would be: a Council consisting of-an equal number of representatives of railway workers and railway users, to Avhich should be referredall questions of wages, rates  and regulation.  The chief executive officials  of the  service would presumably have the right to attend, and speak but not to vote,  and would  supplyany  information needed to  enable the Council to decide on alternative proposals.  -     One objection  to such a scheme appears at first sight to arise from the absence of organisation among railway users ;  but  a survey of existing industrial organisation wouldseem to suggest that such a difficulty is by&apos;no means insuperable.   It is worthy of note that a detailed scheme along  such lines  in connexion with the railways has already beenput forward in America.     But  where the State is  the owner, and the profit or loss on the working of the railwaysis therefore a matter affecting every taxpayer, it cannot divest itself altogether  of theresponsibility for the wages of railwaymen, or for the  fares charged to the public.  Forthis  reason,, if for no other, a board consisting only of representatives  of the railwaymen and the railway users could never be adequate to settle these questions ;  but the hand ofthe Government would be  considerably  strengthened by the  presence of representativesof the railway users on the Joint Industrial Council for railways, which will no  doubt haveto be established sooner, or later.                     PART II.-DEMOBILISATION  AND RESETTLEMENT. J aveniles.     During February there was a general  increase in the  numbers of juveniles unem- ployed, but there is now evidence that the position, on the whole, is improving.  Despite fluctuations in the interval, the number of girls in receipt of out-of-work donation stood on the 21st March almost exactly  at the point reached on the 14th February, and the number of boys was very little higher than on the earlier date.  Unemployment is pro- bably most prevalent in  the cotton industries of the North-Western division, where large numbers of boys and girls are out of work or are working only part time.  The  situation, however, as affecting workers between the ages of 15 and 18, varies considerably in dif- ferent localities.  Thus,  as regards the employment of boys, the return of demobilised men has produced  different results according to the locality or the industry involved. In general, it  has tended to throw boys out of work, especially the older boys who have been earning high wages.  On the  other hand, in certain cases, as for example, in  the Welsh tinplate and colliery industries or in the boot trade in  Norwich,  Northampton and Leicester,  the return of men from the colours brings with it opportunities for the employment of a large number of boys.  Some difficulty in reabsorption is caused also by the low starting wages which are offered. While, for example,, in North Staffordshire there is a demand for boys and girls in  the pottery industry,&apos; a starting  wage of from 5s. to 6s. / proves  too low to attract  workers.  At  Birmingham and  Wolverhampton  the demand for girls as learners has been fairly high in several trades, but owing to the low initial wages offered the opinion appears to prevail that these vacancies may not  be filled until girls are available who have only just left school.    In spite of these  difficulties, however, it is clear that the absorption of unemployedjuveniles is improving continuously.  The  demand for  their labour, as evidenced byvacancies registered at the employment exchanges, is increasing, and the proportion ofthose who, after receiving out-of-work donation policies, are still claiming donation shows a steady decline.  On the 3rd January,  of every 100 boys  to whom out-of-work donationpolicies had been issued,  72 were receiving the donation, and of every 100 girls, 57.   Onthe 14th March, only 35 out.of every 100 boys to whom policies had been issued wereunemployed, and only about 46 of  every 100 girls.  These proportions are substantiallysmaller than those for civilian men and women on the same date.
                           PART III. PRESS COMMENTS.                           (1)  Labour and Socialist Press.                               (A) Peace Conference.    The Labour papers continue to comment unfavourably on  the secrecy and delaysof the Peace Conference, to protest against the Blockade, and to attribute the  spread of Bolshevism to the &quot; predatory schemes  of Entente imperialism.&quot;   But the &quot; Herald &quot;rejoices that the fear of the  &quot; Bolshevist  bogey&quot; appears to  be breaking&apos; down delaysat last, and forcing the Allies to make  peace both with Germany and among themselves witness the summoning of the German Financial Commission to Paris, an indication thatthe Allies realize they &quot; will want the  assistance of Germany in rebuilding Europe.&quot;  Theclaims of Poland on Dantzig and of France on the administration of the coal-fields of trieSaar basin meet with unfavourable comment everywhere, as being opposed to the prin-ciples for  which the Entente  ostensibly stands.   In the latter connexion &quot; Forward &quot;quotes a statement that the demands  of the miners in the Saar district for an 8-hour claywas refused by the French military authority on the ground that French miners work for10 hours a day ; and reference being made to the 8-hour day of miners in the Palatinate,he added that that system would be abolished as soon as French troops entered the district.Dantzig is now described as the key to peace or war ; the Allies have the choice of eithersupporting Paderewski and plunging  Europe in ruin or bowing to the logic of facts byrecognizing and victualling the Soviet Governments.  The &quot; Herald &quot; wonders what hasbecome of the proposal for a Conference at Prinkipo.    The spread of Bolshevism, and in  particular the Soviet revolution in  Hungary, evokemany interesting and characteristic comments. The &quot; Clarion &quot; reiterates its belief thatBolshevism threatens civilisation, and that a  revolution  based on privation and  not.on principle can accomplish nothing constructive.   The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; without com-mitting itself on the definite principles of Bolshevism, hails the spread of social revolutionin Europe.  The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; not only applauds the &quot; coup &quot;  of  Karolyi-(always assuming he has acted in good faith),  but frankly welcomes the growing place ofthe Soviet in European Socialism, and only regrets that socialistic thought in England haslagged so  much behind, partly because the issues here have not the same urgency.  Itexpresses some doubt, however, as to whether the workers in Hungary have really attained the necessary solidarity; they have apparently preserved the forms of bourgeois govern-ment, and there may be some modicum of truth in the idea that the measures of the Allieshave been the real makers of the revolution.  With these reservations the &quot; Dreadnought &quot;prophesies a rosy future for the new Bolshevik Republic and its spiritual allies-and amongthe latter Germany and Austria, it believes, must soon be numbered; its well-organised:agricultural industry, little injured by the war, will save it from sinking to the  state ofRussia.  No doubt, it adds, drastic action by the Soviets will throw the capitalists intothe arms of the Entente and precipitate the international class war.  The &quot; Dreadnought &quot;    In the  meantime  much  is being done to  prevent the deterioration  involved in a prolonged period of unemployment by co-operation with the Board, of Education in con-nection with the Juvenile Employment Centres  established  for these workers.   There  arenow 192 of  these centres open in the United Kingdom, and of the 56,000  boys and girlsclaiming donation on the 21st March, nearly half were receiving training at these centres.The success  of this experiment, it may fairly be claimed, has exceeded expectation.   Diffi-culties of discipline are fast disappearing, and the educational work is increasing in scope and interest to a degree which was not at first anticipated.   This is particularly the case where centres are in close connexion with  technical schools.  There has been some hesi-tation on the part of Education Committees in setting up these centres,  owing in part to  difficulties as to premises and staff, but owing also to doubts  about their  value.On the whole, the belief that  unemployed juveniles  are  unlikely  to be  sufficientlyfitted  educationally to  benefit by  the instruction  given, seems to  lack justification.In many cases, and especially among the ol&apos;der boys who have had actual  experience inworks, they have shown  considerable  ability and  keenness, and cases are  not unknownwhere, when on arriving at the age of 18, they have asked for permission to remain at  thecentre.  From this j oint experiment of the Ministry of Labour and the Board of Education,there may be expected even more valuable results than the mere prevention of habits ofslackness so&apos;easily contracted during enforced idleness.
 Relieves that the &quot; Ten &quot; foresaw such a struggle, and contemplated it with a complacence born  of  their delusion that Capital must win.   A protest by the Hungarian Socialist Party against the representative policy of the Allies in Hungary is  published.     The &quot; Herald &quot; points out that at the Peace Conference the women of France have gained the  greatest victory they have yet won  by establishing their claim to be heard by the International Committee on Labour Legislation.   In the same paper Major H. J. Gillespie maintains that the real lesson of the war is that, in view of the demonstrated impossibility under modern conditions of destroying an armed force with  sufficient spirit to^ make it profitable, we  must either abandon militarism or commit ourselves to the principle of making war  on civilian populations.   The &quot; Clarion  &quot;  has  an interesting proposal that the lands formerly under Turkish rule should be placed under a protectorate of the United States.                                 (B) Foreign Affairs.     The Governments policy in Egypt and  India  is again reviewed unfavourably.   In the former country the administration of General Allenby is viewed with a certain amount of hope, based on his previous record in the East; in the latter the new legislation affecting the status  of political persons,  even  after  their release from confinement, is bitterly attacked. Reference is made to Labour developments abroad the national programme of the miners in America (similar to that  of their industrial confreres in England) ;  the failure to quash the strike in Barcelona by the  use of the weapon  of conscription ;  and in France the demand of the police for trade-union rights, and of the postmen for an 8-hour day, are all hailed with enthusiasm.  The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; dealing with the International Congress at Berne, quotes opinions of Continental socialists to  the effect that it was more a congress of nationalities than an International Socialist Congress,  and regretting its failure to come off  the fence and declare for Bolshevism.  The English Labour  Party&apos;s lack  of a consistent foreign policy comes in for serious criticism in the &quot;Call.&quot;                                  (G) Home Affairs. The Triple Alliance.     The publication of the  three reports-of the Coal Mines Commission leads to a review of the general position of  the three partners  in  the Triple Alliance.  The Labour press is not slow  to urge that the Miners&apos; Report is realty a majority report, and to protest against the  failure of the Government to adopt it as such.  At the same time, it is criti- cisecl in  the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; as &quot; reading like a clever advocacy of certain  theoretic principles, instead of simply summing up the irresistible conclusion  of the overwhelming body of facts presented in evidence &quot; ; and  the failure to lay sufficient stress on  Mr. Straker&apos;s evidence for control by the workers is deplored.  The Owners&apos; Report is dismissed as &quot; the  inevitable utterance of a Capitalist  interest, which can hardly be expected to report in favour of its own  extinction.&quot;  With regard to the Sankey Report and its  adoption by the Government,  there  is much divergence of  opinion.  Papers like the &quot; Herald &quot; &quot;Labour Leader&quot;  and  &quot;Forward&quot;  regard  it  as an  &quot;unthinkable advance&quot;  cbn- taining &quot; substantial  concessions,&quot; and the &quot; Clarion &quot; says the miners have won &quot; the. most wonderful victory in  industrial history.&quot;  The &quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought,&quot; on  the other hand,  regards the terms  as  &quot; poor,&quot; and  asks why only  one penny of  the huge&apos; profits on every ton of coal should be devoted to the improvement of conditions in the districts  where the miners live ;  while &quot; Justice &quot; declares that the burden of the miners&apos; improved status will fall mainly on the consumer and  taxpayer, leaving the  owner in an even  better financial position than he was before the war.    But even where  the Governments offers are welcomed, there does not seem  to be much confidence in the prospect of their  being  carried out &quot; in spirit and in  letter &quot; ; &quot; the spirit  of the Government may be willing,&quot; remarks the &quot; Herald,&quot; &quot; but  the flesh of its Tory supporters is very stubborn.&quot;   The haste with which the Report was adopted is in itself regarded by some  papers as &quot; suspicious &quot; ;  clearly the  Government is only temporising, and has not been converted on any point of principle.   Even after accepting the unhesitating condemnation of the existing system, it may avoid the direct issue of nationalisation by offering a stereotyped edition of war-control, or a  national trust under some  modified form of control.   With regard to the railwaymen,  the situation is  de- scribed as even less satisfactory.   &quot; Justice &quot; regards them as at present the storm-centre, and points out how internal friction between the conflicting  unions  increases the danger of a strike.   &quot; Forward &quot; deplores the fact that the railwaymen have been induced  to treat with a Government Department instead  of directly with the  House of Commons,and the &quot; Call &quot; thinks it was a  &quot; lamentable mistake &quot; to let the question of wages take
 precedence of that of control.  The transport workers, on the other hand, are believed to have  practically achieved their  immediate aim ;  but all the papers are agreed that the possibility of a strike is by no means past.  If it does come about, says the &quot; Herald,&quot; the Government will b?. responsible, for the unions have shown lemarkable, if not culpable moderation.   Indeed, although the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and &quot; Clarion,&quot; and on the whole the &quot; Herald &quot; appear to support those elements in the Labour world which would accept the Government offer and abandon the idea of a strike, they do it with the express reserva- tion that unless the Government is  prepared to make far greater concessions on points of principle, industrial peace will  only take the shape of &quot; a running armistice subject to* revision &quot; ; while papers like the &quot; Call &quot; and &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot; accuses the &quot; moderates &quot; of whittling down  the industrial programme in  subservience to &quot; that Capitalist bogey, the Public.&quot;  They reiterate that increased wages and shorter hours can never bring about that co-operative commonwealth which is the ultimate goal, nor can any  real advance be won with a  display of organised industrial strength.  The &quot; Dreadnought&quot; appears to welcome the sporadic strikes which are breaking out among the rank and file or the miners;  it thinks  that even Is. a day more pay and an hour  a. day  less  work worth fighting for, still more  the principle of joint control.   Unless  the rank and file take matters into their own hands, it adds, the Triple Alliance will simply subside.     Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s &quot;threat &quot; to  the Triple  Alliance is widely commented upon.  The &quot; Herald &quot;  remarks that he speaks with  one voice in  Parliament, and with another to the representatives of Labour- and draws the inference  that  organised labour is now strong enough to make the knees of authority tremble.  The  &quot; Dreadnought &quot; deplores that the  Labour leaders did not take up the &quot; challenge &quot; at once, instead of continuing to patch up  compromises.   But  there is  widespread suspicion throughout the Labour press  that, whatever Mr. Law may have  intended Labour  to read into  his words, to Capita] it was a definite  reassurance as to  the Governments attitude in the event of a struggle.   In  this connexion the parade  of  the  Guards  through London, the alleged commandeering of premises for troops by the Government, and an appeal from the Road Transport Board for the services of owners of private motor  cars in the event of an industrial crisis, are considered to have a sinister  significance.  The &quot; Workers&apos; Dread- nought &quot;  calls attention to a resolution passed, it avers, by &quot; many of the local branches &quot; of the  Discharged  and Demobilised Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Association, expressing fears of the calling-up of Class Z men  to protect Capitalists, and pledging their  members to &quot; support the  trade unions concerned &quot; in the event of a struggle in the coal-field. The Transport Bill.     The Transport Bill is generally welcomed as a step in the direction of socialism.  The &quot; Clarion  &quot;  derides the wastefulness of the present system  which socialists have been attacking on this  ground for  generations.   But the absence of any  real machinery  for control by the workers is deprecated, and  some of the  papers doubt whether a Govern- ment Department under  a Capitalist State would  not waste more in red tape  than it would economise by unified control. The&apos;*Rent  Restriction Bill.    The amendments introduced  by the  House of  Lords, says the  &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;&apos; show that the war has not changed that body from being the last refuge of the propertied interests. Ministry of Health.    An article in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; criticises the professional control  which it is proposed  to set up.  Co-ordination  and unification of medical services are admitted to be necessary, but &quot; lay control, common sense and freedom&apos;from narrow professionalism &quot; should be the mottoes if the Ministry is to be of real help  and guidance. Tlie Land.    The only reason why the  agricultural industry cannot pay  a higher wage to  its labourers, it is asserted, is the wastefulness  of the present system of tenure a wasteful- ness which ought to be exposed by  a Commission  similar to that which sat on the Coal Industry; and the Government ought not to subsidise farmers to  compensate them fortheir  own incompetence.   The  scheme for  settling discharged  soldiers on the  land is dealt  with in &quot; Justice,&quot;  which says that while it is the best scheme yet propounded forthe setting up of small holdings, obstacles to its working are apparently arising already,.
 and maintains that small holdings can never hold their own against large farming from the economic standpoint.  The  scheme for the &quot;technical training of farmers  is very favourably received&quot; Ireland.     Labour papers prophecy  that the denial of a popular welcome  to  De Valera will only increase his popularity, and that of the ideas he stands for.  The treatment of political prisoners in Belfast Gaol is stated to  be worse than the Tsarist regime in- Russia&apos; Food  Control.     Referring to the liquor  statistics of the past year,  the &quot; Herald &quot; finds in them evidence that the restriction in the supply of raw material for brewing has only enabled the brewers to  fleece  the consumer and make enormous profits despite the reduction in consumption. Import Restrictions.     Dealing with  the resignation of Lord Emmott, the  &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that even the United States and Canada cannot show such an example of political co-operation as the &quot; wicked conspiracy &quot; to secure a  preponderance  of the affected interests on the sub-committees in the restriction of imports ;  and it calls for justice on the perpetrators. of &quot; this criminal  act of public  robbery.&quot; Trial  of W. F.  Watson.     Some of the Labour papers suggest that this conviction was against the plain con- clusion of the evidence, and that  the sentence was entirely pre-arranged. Trade Union Policy and Prospects.     Reviewing  the general position of trade  unionism,  the Labour  papers note  with satisfaction (a) the spread of trade unionism among classes like the police,  the agricultural labourers, shop assistants and &quot;the black-coated  proletariat,&quot; and  its renaissance in Ireland;  (b) the gradual co-ordination between unions in pursuance of the policy of &quot; one big union &quot;;  (c) the growing acceptance of a forward policy of national minima and joint  control.  Guild  socialism, remarks the &quot; Herald,&quot; is now on the offensive instead of on the defensive;  and the miners have  skilfully  turned the. flank of the &quot; unofficial&quot; movement within their  own ranks by  adopting its programme and choosing from its numbers the new secretary  of  the  Federation, Mr.  Hodges.  Disquieting features are perceived in (a) the delay on the part of the Government in restoring trade union con- ditions ;  (6) disunion within the ranks of trade unionism, particularly  in the  engineering trades;  and (c) the danger of acquiescence in an industrial peace cemented by Whitley Councils and based on social injustice.  In this latter connexion the &quot; Labour  Leader &quot; urges that Whitley Councils which tend to establish themselves most readily in the least  organised trades should be used mainly as  Conciliation Boards,  and it wonders why the Government had not set them up for the benefit of its own employees in the Police Force and the  Post Office.  On the outlook for the future the Labour papers have much to say this week.,  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward.&quot; urges that the  two goals  of&quot; decisive control over every great industry &quot; and &quot; the elimination of parasitism &quot; can be  achieved &quot; quietly, calmly and  by political constitutional methods &quot;; and he&apos; urges that by tireless propaganda trade unionists should make it clear that the programme they  advocate is in the interest  of consumer as well as producer, instead of allowing the Government to arrogate to itself the ill-fitting role of consumers&apos; friend.  The &quot; Herald,&quot; too, thinks that the socialist goal  is in sight.  The economic situation inflation, unemploy- ment and the fear of  meeting current expenditure out of revenue will soon bring about a political  crash ;  and labour  must see to it that  it  is prepared then, by its prior work of constructive propaganda,  to  bring about &quot;proletarian control&quot; bloodlessly at  once, and not allow  itself to be enmeshed in the toils of a bourgeois government.  Industry must create a  body which will  speak with purpose and effect to the   effete House of Commons.&quot;  The  abandonment by Mr. Blatchford of his former theory  that the worker only  gets one-third of what he  produces is referred  to by most of the  Labour papers ; but they affirm that  no arithmetical computation can alter the fundamental fact of the expropriation of labour or the essential incompatibility (often lost sight of by labour leaders, who desire to be thought &quot; moderate &quot;) of Labour and Capital.
                                     PART IV.                                    (1) General. Railwaymen.    Reports from various parts of the country reveal a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the terms of the railway settlement.  Resolutions have been passed at various centres giving expression to this dissatisfaction.  The outstanding questions connected with the payment of overtime wages for night work, and with the position of shopmen, have been left in the  hands of the Executive of the N.U.R. for settlement with Sir A. Stanley and the R.E.C.  Mr.  J. H. Thomas and members of the Negotiating Committee met Sir A. Stanley and the R.E.C. at the Board of Trade on 31st March, and arranged the preliminaries with a view to a general conference on the points outstanding. Miners. ,    The attitude of the miners towards the  Sankey Report varies considerably.   South Wales is a storm centre  of agitation against acceptance.  Reports from other  centres show a tendency to regard the terms as fair  and to accept the  Report.  In view of the agitation against acceptance, the Executive Committee of the M.F.G.B.  issued a manifesto to the miners on the evening of March 27th.   This set out the reasons  for the acceptance of the Government offer by the Delegate Conference and enumerated the points gained in respect of hours, wages, nationalisation and housing.  The manifesto  ends with a strongappeal to the miners to continue  working and to trust to the justice of their cause andthe power of their organisation to attain their object.   The general conference of Delegates of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, held on the 31st March at Cardiff, decided by 168votes to 102 to advise the members of the Federation to reject the Government offer basedon the Sankey Report.    According to latest reports the Miners&apos;   Federations of  Yorkshire,  Lancashire andCheshire, North Staffordshire, the  Miners&apos; Councils of Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire,the Miners and Quarry men&apos;s Association of Cleveland, a mass meeting of miners in theSheffield district and the men&apos;s leaders in Scotland and Northumberland have decided torecommend the  acceptance of the Sankey Report.   In Nottinghamshire, Lancashire andCheshire there were large majorities in favour  of this  course of action.                (2)  Tfie Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.    Allowances and Gratuities.-The &quot; Birmingham Post &quot; (24th March) reports that ata meeting of the Birmingham citizens&apos; committee it was stated that the number of applica-tions  from demobilised  men who have failed to obtain their pay  is very considerable.The chief cause of complaint is the delay on the part of the Post Office in paying the servicegratuity.  Another difficulty is the interval which elapses  between the  cessation of separation allowance and the payment of unemployment donation.    Unemployment.-^ &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; (25th  March) states that &quot;the most striking  feature about the present  state of the unemployment register  is the rapidly growing  number of demobilised men who cannot be placed.&quot;    Unemployment Donation.-^  &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (27th March)  reports that15,000 unemployed men and women held a meeting at Burnley on the 26th March  and passed a resolution  protesting against  the reduction in unemployment donation.  Adeputation waited on the Mayor.    Ex-Service Men on the Land.-The &quot; Western Press &quot;  (28th March) reports that at ameeting  of discharged soldiers  at Weston-super-Mare on the 27th March,  a resolution was passed protesting against the   apparent intention of the Government  to recede fromtheir distinct promise that demobilised sailors and soldiers should become owners of theland.&quot;    The  Resettlement  of Ex-Officers. The &quot; Westminster Gazette  &quot; (31st March) considersthat it is a &quot; hard  but simple fact that employers will only engage ex-officers or anybody&apos;else because they believe they are men who will be of value in  their business.&quot;  To goon any other principle would spell ruin.  &quot; We do not want appeals to employers to takemen who have fought for the country.&quot;
 Transport  Workers.     Carters.--With reference to the agreement reached between the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and certain Employers&apos; Associations in the Carting Industry for a 48-hour week without reduction of pay to come into force not later than 31st&apos; March, the parties have now furnished a supplementary agreement as to the substituted rates of wages payable in the London area (including the City and Metropolitan Districts).  The Minister has formally approved this agreement which accordingly lays  down as the  substituted rates of  wages under Section I  (1) Wages Act, the present rate of wages including war wage as  set out in the agreement.     Following  a request from the parties for the  extension of  the agreement by Order, to  the whole of the London District,  the Minister is seeking the  advice of the Interim Court of Arbitration in accordance with  Section II (3) of the same act.  The Court will consider the  question on Thursday, 3rd April.     Omnibus Workers. Negotiations have been proceeding on the claims of these workers during the week and it is expected that  a settlement will be arrived at in an adjourned meeting  to be held on Thursday, 3rd April.                              Other  Workers&apos;-Demands.     Farm  Workers. The negotiations which have been proceeding  on  the questions of  shorter  hours and better  wages for farm workers have culminated in the following decisions, which were arrived at by the Agricultural Wages Board  on 27th March :-     (1) Hours  to be reduced to 54 in  summer and 48 in winter, in counties  where they           exceed these figures.     (2) Wages to be increased as follows  :-.           Workers between 18 and 19 years of age, 3s. weekly.           Workers between 19 and 20 years of age, 4s. weekly.           Workers between 20 and 21 years of age, 5s. weekly.           Workers over 21 years of age, 6s. Qd. weekly.     Corresponding increases  are made for special classes of workers.  The  Order will be  issued after the lapse of one  month the period agreed upon during which objections may be lodged.     Electrical Trades Union. The National ballot on the question of the  working week gave a majority of 2,452 against a stoppage to secure the 40-hour  week, and a majority of 4,466 in favour of a stoppage to secure a 44-hour week.  This majority is not sufficient to authorise a strike.     Actors&apos; Association. -Negotiations have been proceeding between theatrical managers. and the  Actors&apos; Association  with regard to  payment for rehearsals and  the minimum wage for all actors and actresses.  The dispute has  reached an acute stage in consequence of the attitude taken up by Mr. C. B. Cochran,  who has stated that he will  not engage anyone who is  a  member  of  the Actors&apos;  Association.  A meeting is to  be held on April 27th to  consider the  position  which  has arisen out of Mr. Cochran&apos;s boycott of the Association.     Police. The rules of the National  Union of Police and Prison Officers  were reviewed and amended at the Conference  of the  Union which was held last week.     Asylum  Workers. The  asylum workers employed by the  L.C.C. were prepared  to force their demand for  a 48-hour Aveek,  by  striking on the 14th instant.   A motion  to concede a 48-hour week was on the Agenda of the L.C.C. on 1st April, and was agreed to.    Shipyard Workers. An arbitration award on the claims of the piece and lieu workers, arising out of the 47-hour week agreement which led to  a two months&apos; strike in North- Eastern Shipyards,  was issued yesterday.  The arbitration court  decided that no  loss would, or should result to the men by reason of the number of hours  of the normal working week being reduced from 54 or 53 to 47  in regard  to piece-workers.  In the case of lieu workers paid at hourly or daily rates above the standard time rates, the  court decided that they shall be paid for a 47-hour week at the same rates per full week, or ratio for thefewer number of hours&quot; or days&apos; work, as they received prior to the reduction of the working week.  On the claim in respect of payment for assistant rivetters, the court decided thatthis class of worker, including rivet heaters shall, unless they share in a definite proportionin the earnings  of their squads, receive from the employer an enhanced rate in respect ofthe shorter week.  A conference of employers and  employees in the Engineering Tradeswas held on 1st April at the Central Hall, Westminster, at which an agreement Was reached in regard to piece-work prices in adjustment of and arising out of the 47-hour week.
    Cotton Mills. At a conference of representatives of employers and employed in theLancashire Cotton Spinning Industry, it  was decided to close down all mills spinningAmerican cotton, from the 10th to the 28th April.   The stoppage is due to the bad stateof the trade,  and will be imposed upon all mills.  It is estimated that 100,000 operativeswill be affected.    A.S.E. All the District Local Secretaries  who were suspended by the A.S.E. some weeks ago have now been reinstated.  The question of the reinstatement of the  district councils of London, Glasgow, Belfast and the  Clyde has not yet been decided.Bakers.    Twelve-hours&apos; old Bread Order and Night Baking. The question as to what action shouldbe  taken by  the. Government Departments concerned, in the event of a strike,  is beingconsidered by the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet.  In the meantime,  the ballottaken by the Operative Bakers&apos; Union  has resulted in a majority of 17 1  in  favourof a national  strike if the Government does not, in the event of the Twelve-hours&apos; clause of the Bread Order being withdrawn, substitute an Order prohibiting night baking between11 p.m.  and  5 a.m.  A delegate  meeting of the  Union instructed  the  Executive tocall a strike on any date after the 12th April.    It is interesting to note that a Bill has passed the French Chamber prohibiting nightwork  in the  Bread Trade.  The Chamber proposed  prohibition between the hours of10 p.m and 5 a.m., but accepted amendments by the Senate altering it to  11 p.m.  and4 a.m., and  postponing the operation of  the measure for twelve  months.   This wouldappear to make the measure of very little practical, use.Joint Industrial Councils.   Reports on Industries.    Gas. The Provisional Drafting Committee appointed by the Full Trade Conferenceon the 18th March met at Montagu House on the 26th March.   The reports of the  con-stituent&apos;associations will be submitted to a further meeting of the Full Trade Conference,to be held at Montagu House on the 15th April, and the constitution will then be finallyadopted.    Musical  Instruments. The Drafting Committee met at Montagu House  on the  28thMarch, and drew up a&quot; Constitution for a Joint Industrial Council for this Industry.Government Industrial Establishments.    The Provisional Committee held its second meeting at Montagu House  on the  26thMarch,  Sir Malcolm Ramsay of the Treasury taking the chair, and after making certain minor amendments, approved  the draft  constitutions as prepared by the Sub-Committeefor :          (a) Departmental Joint Council.         (b) Trade Joint Council.         (c) Works or Yard Scheme.    These draft schemes will he issued  to the  Government Departments concerned andto the trade  unions having members in  Government Industrial Establishments, in orderthat they may be fully informed of the Committee&apos;s progress.    Joint Conferences will be called for  each  Government Department concerned for thepurpose  of adapting, these schemes to the special requirements of the Department andthe establishments under  its control.  When  the schemes have been  thus adapted  theywill be  submitted to the trade unions as arranged at the preliminary conference on the20th February.    Civil Service. Invitations have been issued to Government Departments and Associa-tions  of Civil Servants to  the  Preliminary Conference on the application of the  WhitleyReport  to the Civil Service, to be held on the 8th April at  Caxton Hall, Westminster,S.W.   The Rt. Hon. Austen Chamberlain, M.P.,-Chancellor of the  Exchequer,  will be inthe chair.                                                        .  .                         Asylum Authorities and their Staffs.    The  Committee of the Asylum  Authorities met on the 26th March, and resolved to inform the National Asylum  Workers&apos; Union that they were prepared to confer  withrepresentatives of that union  on the  Union&apos;s national  programme in so far  as IndoorStaffs were concerned, but that they reserved their  right to confer with the other unionsat any time.   This  offer  has  since been  accepted  by the National Asylum  Workers&apos;Union, and a conference  between the Committee of the Asylum Authorities and repre-sentatives of  the National Asylum Workers&apos; Union  will be held on the 4th April.
     It may be useful to mention some of the main features of the work performed during the week by  existing Councils, as illustrating the lines along which their activities are*: developing.     Baking, A Conference was held at the House of Commons on the 24th March between representatives of the Ministry of Food, the Home  Office, and  the  Ministry of Labour,,.to consider whether the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, Section 2 GG should be used to prohibit night baking.  The&apos; Rt. Hon. G. H. Roberts, Minister of Food, presided.  He stated that the Ministry of Food wished to withdraw the 12-hour clause of the Bread Order at once as there was a general demand for it.  He did not think that the D.O.R.A. should be applied to deal with a Labour dispute.  On the  other hand, the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Food pointed out that if a strike took place, the food supply would be seriously affected, and they had no powers to regulate the hours of men&apos;s labour. It was ultimately decided to refer the  decision  to the Home  Affairs Committee of the Cabinet. Building.    - Education Sub-Committee. A meeting&apos; was held in Manchester  on the 28th March for the purpose of approving a pre-war apprenticeship scheme for the building trade in accordance with  the revised scale of-payments.     Elastic Webbing. The third meeting of the Council was held at Leicester on the 27th March.  The  workers&apos; side brought forward a joint  scheme prepared by the two unions for a drastic revision of the wage rates in the industry.     The workers also demanded a maximum  working week of 44  hours with one break, and to extend over six days.     On the question of hours, a unanimous agreement was reached, it being decided that a 48-hour week should be established from the 7th April, those working a shorter week not to be prejudiced.     On the subject  of wages, the employers made an  offer which  had been agreed upon at  the meeting of the Employers&apos; Federation that  morning, of  a  consolidated bonus of 75  per cent,  on pre-war rates, to  all female workers.     It was ultimately decided to appoint  a sub-committee of four a side to discuss the wages of women. Furniture Trade: Interim Executive Committee.     A meeting was  held at the Ministry of Labour on the 27th  March.   The Committee revised its original pre-war Apprenticeship Scheme in accordance  with the revised  scale of payments under which the State will contribute one-third instead of one-sixth of the total amount payable to the returned apprentices.  When the scheme is finally sanctioned by the full Council  and approved by the Ministry,  all agreements under it will become operative as from the 1st January,  1919.  Considerable satisfaction Avas expressed by both sides Avith the modification of the financial clauses by the Government.     Made-up Leather Goods. The Executive met on the 26th  March, and the Council on the 27th March.   The Constitution  of District Councils and  Works Committees were finally approA^ed  and ordered to be printed.                                 (2) District Reports. South Midlands and Eastern.     Employment-Vnhlic  works are being arranged at Ipswich, Southend and Grays ; a scheme is proposed at Luton for the training of workers in straw-plaiting; and the depart-. ment is  inves&apos; igating  the  prospects of employment in the brick-making industry at Peterborough. South-W ester n.     Resettlement Plans.-ki\ extensive  road-repairing scheme in Gloucestershire is held up for lack of materials.  Cornish mining is depressed, especially at Redruth, but a com- pany intends  to re-open some of the Cornish slate quarries ;   afforestation is proposed for certain areas  of the Duchy Estate ;  the oyster  fisheries Avhich Avere originally  a AvarideA^development  at  Falmouth  are being retained and  expanded; and  brickyards are  being-opened both at.

At Newcastle-under-Lyme cotton is wanted  for fustian, coal for  pottery  making and : seasoned timber tot building.  At Bromsgrove there is shortage of leather; and at Tamworth, ; shortage of material for tape making, of pulp for paper mills and of coal for brick making.     &apos; Piiblic  Works. Publiq works include a  housing scheme, road making and bridge  building atReclditch, and housing, road repairing and school building at West Bromwich.

Public works are being started in Leeds  and Sheffield.  It is suggested that, since no large orders for brick making are  being placed  by the  Divisional  Controller  of Building Materials, local authorities should themselves  place  orders, as needed, on  his behalf.  Municipal laundries and state-aided shops for.  disabled men lire  under consideration,  while there  is a demand that the  National Shell  Factory at Derby should be used as a training centre for disabled men.  Northern.      Engineering and Shipbuilding. There is a keen demand for  riveting  squads on the  Tyne and Wear, and for platers&apos; helpers  at Hartlepool and on the Tees, but  single riveters  have difficulty in being accepted owing to the hostility of the squads to strange workers.  The industrial outlook has not been improved by the opposition of the A.S.E. and the  Electrical Trades Union to overtime,  nor by the objections of the unions to the training of  unskilled workers  as pneumatic hammerers.   Demarcation  disputes, controversies  over  piece prices, and a new movement for shorter hours have hindered resettlement.      Housing. A  number  of  housing  schemes are proposed, but  little is  being done.  Speculative  builders are opposed to competition from local authorities;  for  example,  a proposal to use the national factories in the area to make doors and windows is criticised  as taking away work from inside bench hands of private firms and making  the training of  apprentices difficult. *                                                   1  Wales.     Employment. Unemployment at Swansea is  mainly among general labourers.&apos;  A  decrease in the number of  unemployed women is reported, as many have been resettled  in domestic service.  A proposed municipal laundry and a  toy  factory  should further  decrease their numbers.   At Llanelly a decrease in the number of unemployed has resulted  from the demand  of the tinplate works  for  labour.   Generally,  the number of workers;  reabsorbed in industry is said to be now at least equivalent to the discharges.  The tinplate  manufacturers in  South Wales are considering the formation of a joint  selling agency  with a view to eliminating middlemen&apos;s profits and reducing costs  of production in the  face of American  competition.  Scotland.     Jute and Linen Centres. Discharged women workers from  Rosyth  Dockyard  are  finding it difficult to secure work in Dunfermline, where  the linen  mills cannot receive  them.     &quot;  Strong feeling &quot; is reported from Dundee where the jute and flax industries threaten  to collapse.   Arrangements have been made by the Department to cope with the donation  payments to the workers affected by  the adoption of the &quot;alternate weeks&quot; working  arrangement at 14 mills ;  and a conference between representatives of the jute industry  and the Ministry  of Labour  was arranged for the  27th  March.   The Dundee Chamber,  of Commerce has considered the India office&apos;s scheme to ration the next jute crop in the  event of shortage, but expresses distrust of the policy of the Indian manufacturers.     At Dundee, a housing scheme  was threatened with failure  or  suspension until  the  Area Officers attached to the Divisional  Council Staff opened up relations with firms  able  to supply bricks.   The Technical College in the city is arranging summer training courses  for apprentices.   Another flax and  jute  town, Arbroath, contemplates an  extension of its harbour  works.     Shortage of Raw Maierial-h&amp;ck  of  raw material seems the general difficulty  in  turning  over to  commercial production.   In Clydebank  and  Dumbarton  no  more  workers, it  seems, can be absorbed unless  stocks are  released;  and the Edinburgh
t                                  PART V. DISPUTES.(a) Involving a  Stoppage of Work.            The strike of the Nottinghamshire miners has been settled ; on the 31st March the Notts       . Miners&apos; Council recommended their men to resume work on the 2nd April.  The owners have        agreed to establish a price list for main road workers and a new  scale of wages for colliery        clerks; outstanding questions will be dealt with by the Coal Controller after the resumption of        work.            The strike of the South Wales miners which began on the 24th  March, as a protest against        the Government offer,  assumed serious  proportions on the 27th March, when approximately        60,000 men were idle on that date.  Outbreaks occurred in various other mining districts in        Staffordshire,  involving about 9,000  men, in Derbyshire involving 10,000, in AVarwickshire        8,000, and in  Yorkshire 5,000.  In these latter  cases  the stoppages were due principally to a        misunderstanding, the  men stating that no official notices had been received instructing them        to continue working from day to day.  These strikers returned to  work, however, as soon as        the misunderstanding  was cleared up.   The South Wales miners  are,  with difficulty, being        urged to  return also ;  upwards of 25,000 in the  Ehondda Valley, Dowlais, and Ebbw Vale        resumed work on the 1st April.(b) Not Involving  a  Stoppage of Work.            A strike of bakers to take place  on  the 12th  April, has been authorised by the Union of        Operative Bakers if the abolition of night work is not secured before then.            A strike is threatened in the Wool Department of the Port of London as a protest against        the &quot; method  of the Port of London Authority in robbing their employees of overtime payment        under guise of compensation leave.&quot;            A strike of vehicle and allied workers is threatened at Reading owing to the local employers&apos;        association  and the Corporation of  Reading  repudiating the national agreement for a 48-hOur        week.            An attempt on the part of the Maypole Dairy Company to increase  horns was thwarted        by  the Shop  Assistants&apos; Union;  after an interview between the  Union and the Company,        the directors agreed to  close at 6 p.m. wherever this was the custom in the trade.Local  Advisory Committee lias forwarded to  the Divisional Council a recommendation that all available supplies of raw material in the country should be released at reasonable prices although these may be below original costs.    Employment Exchanges. With a view to placing unemployed workers, Govan Exchangehas adopted the plan of forwarding classified lists of workmen on the Live Register  to suitable employers.  In  Inverness, where the  problem of bringing the unemployed  intouch with  the demand for labour  is peculiarly difficult, a publicity campaign  has beenarranged to induce empWers to use the  Exchanges to obtain  Avorkers.
