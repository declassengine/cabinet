7, WHITEHALL GARDENS,LONDON, S.W.1.     I circulate for the consideration of the WarCabinet a revised draft of the Electricity (Supply)Bill, together with an explanatory memorandum prepared in the Board of Trade.  .     As the matter is \irgent,  and it is desirablethat the Bill should be introduced as soon as possible,I should be glad of a very early decision.A. C. GEDDES9th April, 1919.
ft  iE1BCIEI0ITY (SUPPH) BUI.     The  draft  of  this Bill now  circulated is a now ono which,.embodies  alterations, made after  discussion with tho chancellor.&apos;of tho tanoquor*   The Treasury have agreed to advance sumsnot exceeding 20 million pounds  for.the construction of gen-orating stations so as to save the  time that will elapse&quot;before the new  organisation is properly at work.   Thesostations will eventually bo taken over by tho District Elec-tricity Boards who will reimburse tho Exchequer,     It has been agreed that the District Electricity Boardsshall as far as possible be financed locally, i,et by loans from local authorities and electricity undertakers,&apos;   Vihorefor one reason or another adequate  local finance cannot bearranged it is proposed that tho Electricity&apos;commisioners should themselves issue stock  .&apos;up  to: a sum of 2d millionpounds, and the Treasury... are. prepared to guarantee the interest on this.     The Chancellor has expressed.the view, with which theBoard of Trade are disposed to agree, that it is reasonable to make- a certain profit where public money is providedfor undertakings of this character, and it is proposed(1) to enable the Treasury to maka  a small charge, say, f or.cent,  in respect of their guarantee, and 2) ; V to leave it open to the Electricity Commissioners to fix the margin &quot;by which.the receipts c  the District electricity boards may exceed their expenditure.F          The  authority of the  War Cabinet to proceed on these     lines is  requested,  and  also a ruling on the  two points  sub-     mi tted to them on the 3rd  March,  namely, (1)  the question     whether Ireland should be  included in the Bill  and  (2) the     suggested clause making  strides without notice  a penal     offence.loard  of  Trade,  April  9th, 1919.
