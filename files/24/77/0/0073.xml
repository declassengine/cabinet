I do not noed to lay stress on the invaluable work which has been done by this Committee during the War, nor on the importance of retaining their&apos; hearty goodwill and oo-oporation whilst  wo have still so much borrowing in front of us.         It will be scon from the letter  that Sir Robert  and his colleagues are now finding great difficulty  with their  Committees owing to the widespread belief that Government expenditure is extravagant and that in particular-the unemployment benefit is wastefully and improperly bestowed. . Sir Robert- told me  that he was met on all hands and not least from  among tho working man  with the statement that they did not see why  they should save in order to pay others to idle.         I am. doubtful whether under present  circumstances the  pay- ment of unemployment benefit ought to be continued, but  if the Cabinet are unwilling to review their decision on this  point,  it is, I think, imperative that steps should be taken to overhaul the existing distribution agencies.   The Labour Exchanges are admittedly overworked and incapable of exercising a proper control.. I am told that there is overlapping between  the pension and the unemployment distribution and I suggest that the Cabinet should appoint the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Pensions, and  the Parliamentary Secretary of the Treasury  a Committee to  examine into the present administration of unemployment benefit  and to report what steps should be taken to prevent its abuse.                          (Intd.)  A. C.TREASURY,  S.W.1.    2nd April, 1919.
TKS HATIOML WAR SAVINGS COMMITTEE                           SALISBURY SQUARE,                                      E.C. 4.                               1st April 1919.Dear VLv chancellor,          We have commenced our oer-ies.. of &quot;Conferences of LocalCommittees, for 1919; and during the last throe weeks I havetaken tlu Chair at Conference in Manchester, Leeds and birmingham-, and a Conference hes also been hold in Crewe atwhich Sir Theodore Chambers presided.-          At each of the -VJ Conferences&apos;we met with particularlysevere criticism of Government extravagance; and at three ofthem resolutions were proposed condemning this extravagance, andespecially calling attention to the Unemployment&apos;&quot;Benefit*  at my suggestion the resolutions were withdrawn, on my undertaking to personally convey the strong feeling displayed at these meetings to you.          Further, we were informed that there was a rapidly growing tendency amongst tho small investors, with whom ourworkers come in contact,  to decline to contribute towards thepurchase of Savings Certificates, -as&quot; thesy felt that&apos; thoir money was.being wsstefully handled, and being utilised to pay their neighbours for doing notning.  We were also told that strong feeling existed amongst employers on the same question,  as they felt that the money being used for the Unemployment Benefit waspreventing them from obtaining the labour they required.          As you are aware, those Conferences, which vary from100 to 200 personsj embrace every class of society; and the delegates are largely drawn from the working-classes.          I think it only right tc let you know these facts,firstly,  because of my undertaking to acquaint you with thefeeling prevalent at these meetings; and, secondly, because i believe that resentment, rightly or wrongly, in connectionwith Government expenditure is spreading very rapidly,  and its effect on any future Government borrowing cannot be ignored.                              Yours sincerely,                                  (3d)  R.M. KIHDERSLEY                                            Chairman.To The Bight Hon.Austen Chamberlain, M.P.,Chancellor of the Exchequer,H.M. Treasury,Whitehall, S.W.1.
