PROGRESS OP  FARM WORg.                Thore was a oontinuanco during tho weok of coldbut fairly dry woathcr, not especially favourable for fieldoperations,.   In come districts, however, good progress was made,,Farm work io still backward for the&apos; time of the year, and owing tothe coldness of tho weather there has been very little growth ofgrass, with the re cult that keen for stock is running short in many parts of the country.2/4/19,
In the potato exporting counties, farmers are impatient as regards the disposal of last year&apos;s crop, as delivery will be difficult once planting of the current season&apos;s crops is commenced. Planting of potatoes is already general in certain districts.

The sowing of gats has begun in places but in some districts ploughing for this crop has not yet been completed.

Winter wheat has been somewhat checked in its growth by the recent cold winds, but on the whole is doing well.

The labour question is still causing anxiety to farmers in many counties, and is reported to be adversely affecting the acreage being put under the plough.

F L A X.

Flaxseed (Ireland)0rder, 1918.  Millowners in a number of districts have completed tho scutching of flax of growers who have complied with the Order. In these districts the Department have arranged to grant permits to defaulters authorising the scutching and salo of their flax. One hundred and fifty-six such permits have been issued to date.

Homesaved Flaxseed. In many districts farmers prefer getting a change of seed to Bowing  local homesaved seed.  As there is an abundant supply of imported seed available, many farmers are unable to dispose of their surplus home saved seed to other farmers in their localities. Under the terms of the Sale of Flaxseed (Ireland) Order,1918, a permit from the Department is required authorising the sale of sewing flaxseed by a farmer to a merchant.  In cases in which farmers are unable to disposo of their seed to other farmers the Department have arranged to grant permits authorising the sale of the seed to merchants, provided it is suitable for sowing purposes. Ninety-five applications for permits have been received to date and 27 permits have been issued authorising the sale of 1195 bags of seed to merchants.

Canadian Flaxseed. It came to the Department&apos;s notice that a circular had been issued by a wholesale merchant to his retail ou?tomors relative to the quality of the Canadian flaxseed allocated by the Government for sowing this season. It was represented in this circular that the seed, in view of its weight per thousand pickles, was poor for sowing purposes. The Department have accordingly issued a circular to all flaxseed merchants in Ireland pointing out reasons why the weight per thousand pickles of flaxseed should not be taken as in itself a true criterion of its relative morit, and urging that farmers should not be deterred from sowing Canadian flaxsood because it may be light in the pickle.
