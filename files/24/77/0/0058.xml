REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCE

Note by the Minister of Labour.

There accompanies this Note a copy of the report of the Committee of the National Industrial Conference, the adjourned meeting of which takes place on Friday next, 4th April.

It will be observed that the report contains some unanimous recommendations by a Committee composed as to one half, of employers and as to the other half, of employees sitting under a neutral chairman. These recommendations inter alia suggest the establishment by law of:-

(1) a maximum number of working hours for all trades - a 48 hour week is recommended.

(2) the establishment by law of a minimum wage for all occupations - the amount to be fixed by a 

Commission which is to investigate and report.

(3) the continuance until 21st November 1919 of the Wages (Interim Regulation) Act which stabilises wages at the level at which they stood at the signing of the Armistice.

(4) the setting up of a National Industrial Council composed equally of employers and employed, and a Standing Committee of such Council for the purpose of investigating and dealing with labour conditiions from time to time and advising the Government, as well as keeping the Public informed of the pros and cons of labour disputes.

It will be incumbent upon the Government to state on Friday what it proposes to do in relation to these various suggestions. I hope to circulate a memorandum on the subject immediately, but I desire to take the earliest opportunity of letting Ministers know what the report contains, and I accordingly circulate the report for their information in order that they may become acquainted with its provisions.

INDUSTRIAL   CONFERENCE                           REPORTOF PROVISIONAL  JOINT  COMMITTEE  FOR  PRESENTATION  TOFURTHER  MEETING  OF  INDUSTRIAL  CONFERENCE, CENTRAL               HALL,  WESTMINSTER,  APRIL 4th,  1919.    At the  Industrial Conference called by the Government and held at the CentralHall, Westminster, on 27th February last, it was resolved :        &quot;That this  Conference, being of the opinion that any preventable dislocation    of industry is always to be deplored, and, in the present critical period of recon-    struction, might  be disastrous to the interests of the Nation, and thinking that every    effort should  be  made to remove legitimate grievances, and promote harmony and    goodwill, resolves to  appoint a Joint Committee, consisting of equal numbers of    employers and workers, men and women, together with a Chairman appointed by    the Government, to consider and report to a further meeting of this Conference on    the causes of the present unrest and the steps necessary to safeguard and promote    the best interests of employers, workpeople and the  State, and especially to con-    sider :              &quot;1.  Questions relating to Hours, Wages  and  General  Conditions of        Employment;             &quot;2.  Unemployment and its prevention;             &quot;3,  The  best  methods of promoting co-operation between Capital and        Labour.        &quot;The Joint Committee is empowered  to  appoint such Sub-Committees as    may  be considered  necessary consisting of  equal  numbers of employers and    workers, the Government to be invited to nominate a representative for each.        &quot; In view of the urgency of the question, the joint Committee is empowered    to arrange with the Government for the reassembling of the National Conference    not later than April the 5th for the purpose of considering the Report of the Joint    Committee.&quot;    A Committee was  elected  accordingly, and the  Government  nominated  sir thomas Munro, K.B.E.,  to be Chairman.

The first meeting of the joint Committee, which was addressed  by the   PrimeMinister, was held on March 4th, and the following resolution was carried :          &quot; That this Committee, in order that its work may be accomplished as expedi-    tiously and thoroughly as possible, divide  itself into  ,three  Sub-Committees,    with the following terms of reference:     (1) To  make recommendations concerning:          (a) The methods of negotiation between  employers and  Trade Unions, in-             cluding the establishment of a permanent  Industrial Council  to  advise             the  Government on industrial and economic questions with a view  to             maintaining industrial peace.         (b) The method of dealing with war  advances, and         (c) The  methods of regulating wages for all  classes  of workers, male and             female, by  legal enactment or otherwise.    (2) To  make recommendations as to the desirability of legislation for a maximum         number of working hours and a minimum  rate of  wages per week.    (3) To  consider the  question of  unemployment, and to make recommendations for         the steps to be  taken for  its prevention,  and  for  the  maintenance  of  the         unemployed in those cases in which it is not prevented, both during the present         emergency period, and on a permanent basis.         &quot;NOTE. Unrest and output to be discussed by the whole Committee at  its    next meeting on statements previously submitted by the parties.&quot;    The Government were requested to nominate  Chairmen of  the Sub-Committees,and for this purpose the services of Sir David Shackleton, K.C.B., and Professor L. T.Hobhouse, D.Litt, were  obtained,  in addition to those of  Sir Thomas Munro.    The work of the Committee has proceeded almost  continuously till the presentdate.   They have not considered it necessary or practicable to take oral evidence, butnumerous views and suggestions in writing have  been placed before them and considered.    Full information  and statistics relating to the subjects  under consideration have,at the request  of the Committee, been supplied by the Ministry of Labour,  the HomeOffice, and from other sources.    As appears from the terms of reference the Committee were  entrusted with  theduty of suggesting means whereby dislocation  of industry, particularly at the presentcritical period, should  be prevented in  the interests  of  the Nation.   It was  the expressed opinion of the  Conference that to secure this end it was necessary that legislation-legitimate grievances  should  be removed, and that  harmony and goodwill should be pro-promoted.  The Committee  were asked to consider and report upon the causes of  the
    The questions to which special attention has been given by this Committee in thetime available are  as follows :          (a) Maximum hours.         (b) Minimum wages.         (c) Methods of dealing&quot; with war advances.    - &apos;   (e/) Recognition of, and negotiations between, organisations of employers and             workpeople.         (e) Unemployment.         (/) The institution  of a National Industrial  Council.  .                                     Hours.    In regard to Hours the Committee are  unanimous in recommending the principleof a legal maximum of normal hours per week for all employed persons.  The&apos;numberof hours they recommend is 48. but they recognise that this number may be reduced byagreement, and that there are also exceptional cases in which it may be necessary that itshould be increased.present unrest, and the steps necessary to safeguard and promote the best interests ofEmployers, Workpeople, and State.   In approaching the subject they were speciallydirected to consider certain specific subjects.     In regard to these specific subjects there was  general agreement that there were difficulties affecting hours and conditions of  employment, wages,  and the methods, oftheir determination; that the whole question of preventing unemployment and provid-ing for its consequence on the individual worker!  when it did occur called for further provision; and that machinery for promoting co-operation between employers and em-ployees should, where necessary, be revised and improved, and should be extended toinclude other industries where methods of negotiation and agreement do not at presentexist.     At the same time  it has been realised that the field of  enquiry opened up by theterms of reference is a vast one, and that to explore and report upon it as a whole wouldrequire  a far closer and more  prolonged examination of its  numerous aspects, both political and economic, than could be  even  contemplated by the present Committee inthe short period of time allotted to them.     On the causes of  industrial unrest and their  suggested remedies, the Trade  union representatives  submitted a comprehensive  memorandum, setting out causes and sug-suggesting remedies.  It  is their  express  wish  that it shall  be published in this report, andit is accordingly printed in full in Appendix 1. hereto.  Several questions referred toin this memorandum have been the subject  of consideration  by the Committee,  andrecommendations are made in this report which it  is  believed will  provide  effective means to remedy or alleviate certain of the  grievances which are advanced.     It has  been  impossible, however,  to attempt any  exhaustive investigation  intoevery aspect of unrest, to examine fully the  relation  between under-consumption  and unemployment, between wage standards  and purchasing power, the relationship of pro-duction to  the whole economic and industrial situation, and many other fundamentalbut complicated  matters of discussion.  It was the intention of the employers to submit a considered statement on the subject of  output or production.  They  have found  itimpossible  to complete a statement in  the time at their disposal, but are prepared to doso at a later date.  For the purpose both of  carrying  on  future  investigation intomatters now affecting the industrial situation and of keeping such matters under con-tinuous review in the future and &quot;advising the Government on them, it is the unanimousview of the Committee that there should be established some  form  of  permanentNational Industrial Council.   The recommendations of the Committee in regard to thefunctions and constitution of the National  Industrial  Council which they  propose,appear below.  It is sufficient at the present stage to record the conclusion of the Com-mittee that such a Council should be instituted, and to point out that in their view matterson which this Committee themselves have been unable to make recommendations wouldbe appropriate subjects for consideration by that Council.
     They  accordingly suggest that legal sanction should be given to trade agreements for the reduction of hours, and that under certain conditions similar sanction might begiven to  such agreements for the augmentation of hours.  They propose that if there be a desire for variation  expressed by one party only, a conference  should be sum-moned, whose decision should, under ordinary circumstances, receive  legal sanction^     They have not deemed it possible within the time at their disposal, nor did they feel competent, to draw up a list of proposed exemptions, but they consider that an interval should elapse after the passing of the Act in which applications for exemptionsshould be made and that enquiry should when take place into  each  case,  and theapplication of the Act should, if necessary, be postponed in any particular case untilthe completion  of such enquiry.     Thus some occupations may be altogether exempted from the Act, while in othersthe maximum may be varied in either direction by agreement between the parties.     The Committee&apos;s detailed recommendations under this head  are as follows : Maximum to be specified in Act.     i. That the maximum normal working hours per week should be  48, and that thismaximum should be established by Act of Parliament.Act  to be of general application.     2. That the Act shall apply generally to all employed persons, but that provisionshall be made for exemption from or variation of the terms of the Act to be granted in proper cases, as follows :                                                  -   -Agreement to substitute lower maximum.     3. That where an agreement has been arrived at between representative organisa-tions of employers and employed in any trade and  by such agreement provision  ismade that the number of working hours per week for that trade shall be lower than themaximum established under the Act, the Secretary of State or other appropriate Minis-ter shall, if he has no reason to deem it contrary to the public interest, make an Orderprescribing the lower number of hours as the maximum for  that trade.Agreement to substitute  higher maximum.     4. That where ah  agreement has been arrived at between representative organisa-tions of employers and employed in any trade and by such agreement provision is made that the number of working hours per week for that trade  shall  be higher than themaximum established under the Act, the Secretary  of  State  or other  appropriate minister shall, if he has no reason to deem it contrary to the public interest, make anOrder  prescribing for  the trade, the number of  hours specified in the place  of themaximum established under the Act.Application by  one party only for variation of maximum.     5. That where in any trade representative organisations of either employers oremployed are desirous that the hours established under the Act or an Order should be varied (either by way of decrease or increase), and no  joint  representation has beenmade in accordance with the two preceding paragraphs, the Secretary of State or other appropriate Minister  shall, on a request in writing of the representative organisations of either the empl6yers or the employed concerned,  summon a  Conference of  repre-sentatives of such organisations to consider the advisability of  the provisions  of theAct being varied in order to meet the requirements of the particular trade in  respectof which the request is  made, and in the event  of a substantial agreement being reached as the  result of such conference an Order may be  made by the Minister inaccordance with the provisions of the two  preceding paragraphs.Provision for  variation  or exemption -by  Order.     6. That where in special trades an application is made for variation of the numberof hours established by the Act and no agreement is arrived at in the trade, or where anapplication is made for total or partial exemption from the Act, provision should bemade under the Act whereby, after consultation with the National Industrial  Coun-
cil, a competent authority shall enquire into the application and, where special neces-sity is proved, the Secretary of State or other appropriate Minister may by  ordergrant the application: provided that (a) where  such variation or exemption is granted the competent authority may attach conditions thereto,  and (b)  variation under thisclause shall be granted only where no agreement has been arrived at  under preceding-paragraphs.Provision respecting Orders  varying the number of hours.     7. That Orders substituting in any trade  a number of  hours beyond that estab-lished under the Act shall not  be made unless and until the appropriate  authority is satisfied either that the rate of  wages payable in the trade is fixed on such a basis asto take into account, for payment at an enhanced rate, any extra hours worked, or that provision is made for the payment,  as overtime, of all hours worked over 48 in accord-ance with the provisions of paragraph 10 below.Provision for publication of Orders.     8. Before any Order becomes operative it shall be published for a period of (say)one month to allow of objections being made by either side. In default of such objec-tions the Order shall become operative on the date named.   If substantial  objection ismade, the Secretary of State or other appropriate  Minister shall not make the Orderuntil he has caused public enquiry  to be held.Reference  to  Trade Boards.    9. In any trade for which a Trade Board has been established any proposal to vary the maximum hours shall be  brought before the  Trade Board  for report.Overtime.     10. Overtime,  especially systematic overtime,  should be discouraged,  but it is recognised that in  certain circumstances overtime is unavoidable.  The extent of over-time to be allowed in any trade,  and the conditions under which it may be worked, shallbe determined under the procedure  laid down  in  the preceding clauses for  variation orexemption from the terms of the Act, either (a) by the representatives of the Trade or(b) in the less organised trades  by the  Trade  Board, or, in default of either, by  theSecretary of State or other appropriate Minister, in accordance with general principles laid down by the Minister on the advice of the  National Industrial Council.    Overtime, when worked, shall  be computed and paid for in  accordance with  thecustom of each particular trade in the several  districts concerned, provided that over-time shall in no case be paid for at less than time and  a quarter.  Subject to agree-ments  and  Orders made  under the provisions of Clauses 4, 5  and 6, no person shallbe required to work more than  48 hours without overtime payment.Night  Shift, Sunday, and Holiday Work.     11. The Committee  are of opinion that in any arrangement as to hours and over-time pay the question of  night shift and Sunday and holiday work should receivespecial consideration by the  National Industrial Council.Date of Act coming into  operation.     12. That the Act should not come into operation  until  the expiry of six months from its date, and that in respect to a particular trade, where an enquiry under Clause 6is pending  or in progress, the  appropriate Minister shall  have power by Order  to suspend the operation of the Act for a  further  period not  exceeding  three months.                                    Wages.    The Committee have agreed that minimum time-rates of wages should be estab-lished by legal enactment, and that they ought to be of universal  applicability.   TheCommittee took full cognisance both of the difficulties of determining on  particular
rates and of dealing with exceptional cases.  Having these considerations in mind,they make the following recommendations :          i. Minimum time-rates of wages should  be established by legal enactment    and should  be universally applicable.        2. A Commission should be appointed immediately upon the passing of the    Act to report within three months as to what  these rates should be, and by what    methods and what successive steps they should  be  brought into operation.  The    Commission should advise on the means of carrying out the necessary administra-    tive work.        3. In the meantime Trade Boards should  be  established  forthwith in the    various less  organised trades where they  do not already exist.        4. The Commission should review the Trade  Boards Acts, especially with    the object of facilitating and expediting  as far as possible the procedure in fixing    and applying minimum rates.        5, The Minister of Labour, on the recommendation of the proposed National    Industrial Council, shall appoint the Commission, which shall consist of an equal    number of representatives of Employers&apos; Associations  and Trade Unions, with a    Chairman nominated by the Government.        6. The Commission shall give adequate public notice of its proposed findings    and shall hear representatives of any trade that  may desire to be heard.        7. Where an agreement is arrived at between representative organisations of    Employers and Trade  Unions in any trade laying down a minimum rate of wages,    the Minister of Labour shall have power,  after investigation, to  apply such  mini-    mum rate, with such modification as he may  think fit,  to all employers engaged    in the trade falling within the scope of the agreement.    NOTE. The expression &quot;trade&quot; used in the above proposals relating io maximumhours and minimum wages includes industry, branch of trade or industry, occupation,or special class of workers, whether.for the whole country or a special area.    In  regard to the methods  of  dealing  with  war  advances  the  committee recommend :-    (1)  That the Wages (Temporary Regulation)  Act,  1918, should be  continued in         force for a further period of six months from 21st May, 1919.    (2)  That the  Interim Court  of Arbitration constituted under that Act should hold         an enquiry sitting as a special court for the purpose as  to the war advances         which have been granted and the manner in which they  have been granted,         whether  by way of increase of time rates  or piecework prices or by way of war         bonus, or otherwise, and as to the effect of the  n\ per cent, bonus to time-         workers, and the j\ per cent, to piece-workers, and should determine finally         how these advances should be  dealt with, and  in  particular whether they         should be added to the time rates or piecework  prices, or should be treated         separately as advances given on account  of the conditions due to the war.             Where machinery for negotiation exists in any trade or industry no action         shall be  taken by the  Interim Court of Arbitration affecting such a trade or         industry unless and until such existing machinery having  been put into opera-         tion with a view to arriving at a settlement by agreement between the trade         unions and employers&apos; organisations concerned fails to  arrive  at an agree-         ment by the 1st September, 1919.             Where no machinery for negotiation  exists in any trade or industry, trade         conferences representing the trade unions  and the employers concerned shall be         called by the Ministry of Labour within two months from 4th April, 1919, and         no action shall be taken by the In terim Court  of Arbitration unless such con-
    ferences shall within that time have failed to arrive at an agreement in which    case the Court shall consider and determine the difference  under the powers    conferred by the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act.(3) That the parties should consider the desirability of instituting procedure for a    national periodical review of  the wages of the trade of the country as a whole.         Methods  of  Negotiation  between Employers and Trade  Unions.    On the subject of methods of negotiation between employers and workpeople theCommittee recognised the importance of establishing an understanding on the questionof &quot;recognition.&quot;  Their opinion is  as follows:     (a)  The basis of negotiation between employers and workpeople  should,  as  is         presently the case in the chief industries of the country, be the  full and frank         acceptance of the employers&apos; organisations on the one hand and trade unions         on the other as the recognised organisations to speak and act on behalf of their         members.    (b)  The members should accept the jurisdiction of their respective  organisations..    (c)  The employers&apos;  organisations and the trade unions should enter into negotia-         tions for the purpose of the establishment of machinery or revision, if neces-         sary, of existing machinery, for the avoidance of disputes, and  the machinery         should provide, where in any question at issue there are more  than one em-         ployers&apos; organisation or trade union representing the same class of employers         or workpeople, a representative method of negotiation,  so that settlements         arrived at will  cover all parties concerned.   The machinery should also con-         tain provisions for the protection of the employers&apos; interests where members         of trade unions of workpeople are engaged  in positions of trust or confidential -         tiality, provided the right of such employees to join or remain members  of         any trade union is not thereby  affected.                                Unemployment.    The Committee feel that a satisfactory investigation  of  the  problem of unem-ployment would involve a far-reaching enquiry and in the limited time at their disposalthey have not felt able to do more than indicate briefly some of the steps which mightbe taken to minimise or alleviate unemployment.                       (a) Prevention of Unemployment.    (1) Organised short time. It is already the practice in a large number of trades to-meet periods of depression by systematic short time working.   The Committee  thinkthat this method of avoiding displacement of labour and the consequent risk and incon-venience to  the workpeople concerned has considerable value.  In  this  connectionthey suggest that the.machinery of the Joint Industrial  Councils or other joint repre-sentatiye bodies in each industry affords a convenient method of   controlling  andregulating short time working as a means of preventing unemployment.     Regard should be had at the same time to  paragraph 8  below.     2. Overtime. During periods  of depression in an industry overtime should onlybe  worked in special cases  which should be determined in accordance with rules laiddown in the case of each industry by its Industrial Council or other joint representative body.     3. Stabilising Employment. In  order to provide against, the fluctuating demandfor labour the Committee  think that the Government  should  undertake the  definiteduty of stimulating the demand for labour in bad times by postponing contracts of anon-urgent  character until it is  necessary to promote  a demand for  labour owing tofalling trade.   For this purpose in allocating Government orders consideration should of course be given to the circumstances of the industry  concerned.   The  Committeeare of opinion that much more  effective action could be taken if all orders for particu-
       lar classes of commodities were dealt with by one Government Department.  It would       further be an advantage in order that the policy which they have indicated should &quot; be       carried out  that all Government contracting  should be  supervised by one authority.I)      Local authorities should be urged to adopt a similar policy with regard to work under       their control.           4, Housing. In order to  meet the present crisis the Committee recommend that       the Government should without delay proceed with a comprehensive housing programme       in order to meet the acknowledged shortage of houses.  By this means  employment       would be secured primarily in the building  and furnishing trades, and indirectly in       almost all other trades. The Committee urg &apos; that where local authorities fail to utilise       their powers to provide suitable housing accommodation, the Local Government Board       should take the necessary steps for the erection  of  suitable houses in the area of the       Authority and under  special powers if necessary compel local  authorities to  act in       accordance  with the housing needs of the district.           5.  State  Development  of  Indzistry. The demand  for labour could also be in-      , creased by State development of new industries such as Afforestation, Reclamation of       Waste Lands, Development of Inland Waterways, and  in  agricultural districts  the       development  of light  railways and/or road  transport.   These  are some  of  the       measures which in the opinion  of the Committee might&apos; be  adopted as  a means  of       permanently increasing the  demand for labour.           6. Under-consumption  and higher production. Whilst the Committee recognise       that these questions have a most important bearing on the problem  of  unemployment,       they are agreed that their importance is such as to demand that far closer consideration       should be given to them than can be given by this Committee, and it has already been       indicated in an earlier paragraph of this report that this is a matter which might appro       appropriately be  the  subject of consideration by the National  Industrial Council.           7. Efficacy  of Industrial  Councils.-The Committee feel  that, in regard to un-       employment, as well as for other purposes, the institution of Industrial  Councils or       similar joint  representative  bodies will  develop a sense of common responsibility       amongst employers and employed,  and that it will provide machinery  through which       the trade, acting as a whole, can in  many ways minimise or prevent unemployment. In       particular such Councils would be in a position to collect information and make neces-       sary adjustments in an organised way to meet the ebb and  flow of trade.                        (b)  Maintenance  of Unemployed Workpeople.           8. Provision of Maintmance-The Committee are unanimous in  their  view  that       the normal  provision for maintenance during unemployment should be more adequate       and of wider application than is provided by the National Insurance (Unemployment)       Acts.   They  think, moreover, that whatever may be the basis of the scheme ultimately       adopted, it should include provisions for under-employment as well as for unemployment..           9. Education and Training. Whether provision for unemployment is made on a       contributory or non-contributory basis, the Committee think that it is  very desirable       that the scheme should include provisions for enabling the workers, whilst unemployed,       and in receipt of unemployment benefit, to get  access,  without payment  of  fees, to       opportunities  for continuing their  education and improving their qualifications.   This      ,is specially desirable in the case  of young persons.  It should be the normal arrange-       ment for young persons, that whenever unemployed, they should be required  to  con-       tinue their education at centres  where such facilities are provided by the Local Educa-       tion authority.                . .           10.  Domestic Employment for Married Women and Widows. The effect on the       labour market of the  employment  of married, women and widows, particularly  those       who have young children, was  brought forward, but owing to the fact  that the Cc-m-       mittee had  no official  information  at their  disposal they  felt they were unable to       express an opinion without having full particulars of the circumstances and conditions       under which the  employment of mothers is carried on.  The Committee feel that the       subject is so important that a special enquiry should be immediately instituted to inves-       tigate  the whole matter, and thereafter submit a report.
       II. Limitation of Child Labour. The Committee are of opinion that child labour  is bad in principle, and in practice tends to decrease the chances of adult employment.  For these reasons, without going into details, the Committee think that the age  at  which a child  should  enter employment should be raised beyond the  present  limit.       12. Sickness Benefit and Old Age Pensions. The  opinion of the Committee is  that the amount of sickness and infirmity benefits should be examined  with  a view  to  more generous provisions being made.       In regard to Old Age Pensions, they consider that the age of qualification should  be reduced, that more liberal allowance should be paid, and that the disqualification in  respect of income should be modified.       The Committee  feel that these questions require immediate consideration,  and  they urge the  necessity of appointing a Committee to investigate them and report.                             National Industrial  Council.       As already  indicated in this report, the Committee are impressed with the import-  ance of establishing without delay some form  of permanent  representative  National-  Industrial Council.       The considered views of the Committee are as follows:                                        Preamble.       A National Industrial  Council should not supersede  any of the  existing agencies  for  dealing with industrial questions.  Its object would be to supplement and co-ordi-  nate the existing sectional  machinery by bringing  together the knowledge and experi-  ence of all sections and focussing them upon the problems that affect  industrial rela-  tions as a whole.  Its functions, therefore, would  be5 advisory.       Such a Council would have to be large in order to give due representation to all  the  industrial  interests concerned; at the same time, it should be  as small as is con-  sistent with an adequate representative basis.  Since in any case it would be too large  for  the transaction of detailed  business, a Standing Committee, large enough to  ensure that it will not be unrepresentative, will  be needed.  &apos; The Council must be  elected, not nominated, otherwise its authority will not be adequate to the proper dis-  charge of its functions.  The method of election must  be  determined  by each side for.  itself, subject to two conditions : first, that the members must be representative of orga-  nisations, not of individual employers or workpeople;  and, second, that the  organisa-  tions concerned adopt such a method of election or  appointment that their nominees can  be regarded as fully  representative.       In order that the  Council may have the necessary independent status and autho-  rity if it is to  promote industrial peace, the Government should  recognise  it as the  official consultative authority to the Government upon  industrial relations, and should  make it the  normal channel through which the opinion and  experience of industry  will be sought on all questions with which industry as  a whole  is concerned.       In addition to advising the Government  the  Council  should, when it thought fit,  issue statements on industrial questions or disputes for the guidance of  public opinion.                                      Objects.      To secure the largest possible measure of joint action between the representative  organisations  of  employers and  workpeople, and to be the normal  channel through  which the opinion and experience of industry will be  sought by the Government on  all questions affecting industry as a whole.      It will be open to the Council to  take any action that  falls within the scope of its  general definition.  Among its more specific  objects will be:       (a) The consideration of general questions affecting industrial relations.      (b) The consideration of measures for joint  or several action to  anticipate  and          avoid threatened disputes.      (c) The consideration of actual disputes involving general questions.      (d) The consideration  of legislative proposals  affecting industrial  relations.
(e) To advise the Government on industrial questions and on the general indus-    trial situation.(/) To issue statements for the guidance of public opinion on industrial issues.

If any question arises  as to the meaning or intention of this  Report,  it should bereferred for consideration  to the National Industrial Council.                                  SUMMARY.    The views of the Committee on the questions with which they have been able todeal in the time at their disposal, may  be summarised as follows: H ours.    (a)  The establishment by legal enactment of the principle of a  maximum normal        working  week of  48 hours, subject to     (b)  Provision for varying the normal hours in proper  cases,  with adequate safe-        guards.     c)  Hours agreements  between employers and trade unions to be capable of appli-        cation to the trade concerned.     d)  Systematic  overtime to be discouraged, and unavoidable overtime to be paid        for at special rates.Wages.     a) The establishment by legal enactment of minimum time-rates of wages, to be         of universal applicability.     b) A Commission to report within three months as to what these minimum rates         should be.     c) Extension of the establishment of Trade Boards for less organised trades.     d) Minimum time-rates agreements between employers and trade unions to be         capable  of application to all employers  engaged in the  trade falling within         the scope of the agreement.     e) Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918, to continue  for a further period of         six months from 21st May,  1919.     f). Trade Conferences to  be held to consider how war advances  and  bonuses         should be dealt with, and, in  particular, whether they should  be added  to         the. time-rates or piece-work prices or should be treated separately as advances         given on account of  the conditions due to the war.Recognition of, and negotiations between, organisations of employers and workpeople.    (a) Basis of negotiation between employers and workpeople should be full and         frank acceptance of employers&apos; organisations and trade  unions as the recog-         nised organisations to speak and act on behalf of their members.
                                      &apos;I3                                           *                ...    (b)  Members should accept the jurisdiction of their respective organisations.    (c)  employers organisations and trade unions should enter into negotiations for        the establishment of machinery, or the revision of existing machinery, for the        avoidance of disputes, with provision for  a representative method of negotia-        tion in questions in which the same class  of  employers or  workpeople  are        represented by more than one organisation respectively, and for the protection        of employers&apos; interests where members of Trade Unions of workpeople are        engaged in  positions of trust or confidentiality, provided  the  right of  such        employees  to join  or remain members of any  Trade Union  is not thereby        affected.Unemployment.                       (i) Prevention of Unemployment.    (a)  Organised short time has considerable value in periods of  depression.   The        joint representative bodies in each trade afford convenient machinery for con-        trolling and regulating short time.    (b)  Government orders should be regulated with a view to stabilising employment.    \c)  Government  housing schemes should be pressed forward without delay.  -  (d)  Demand for labour could be increased by State development of  new industries.                  (2) Maintenance of Unemployed Workpeople.    (e)  Normal provision for maintenance during unemployment should be more ade-        quate and of wider application, and should be  extended  to  under-employ-        ment.    (/)  Unemployed persons, and particularly young persons, should have free oppor-        tunities of continuing their education.    (g)  The employment of married women and widows  who  have young  children        should be subject of a special enquiry.    (k)  The age at which a child should enter employment should be  raised beyond        the present limit.            -    ii)  Sickness and Infirmity Benefits, and Old Age Pensions require immediate in-        investigation with a view to more generous  provisions being made.National Industrial Council.    (a)  A permanent National  Industrial Council should be established to consider        and advise the Government on national industrial questions.  .    (b)  It should consist of 400 members, 200 elected by employers&apos; organisations, and        200 by trade unions.    (c)  The  Minister of Labour should be President of the Council.    (d)  There should be a  Standing Committee of  the  Council numbering 50 mem-        bers, and consisting of 25 members elected by and from the employers&apos; repre-        sentatives,  and 25 by  and from  the  trade  union representatives, on the        Council.    There has been apparent throughout the proceedings  an earnest anxiety on thepart of the representatives, both of employers and employed, to approach the subjects of their discussion in a spirit of mutual accommodation so as to arrive at a satisfactory settlement of outstanding difficulties.  The Committee confidently believe that if effect-is given to the recommendations now made, and if the  same spirit that has charac-terised the  deliberations of the Committee actuates  the future consideration  of other difficulties that exist or may arise, much will have been done to promote that spirit of mutual confidence which is a first essential to  the effective and successful  conduct ofindustry in  the interests of employers and  employed and the nation generally.
    In conclusion, the Committee desire to say that they welcome the steps now beingtaken in the direction of International regulation of labour conditions, as they believethat a satisfactory adjustment of labour conditions on an international basis will have a beneficial effect on industrial problems in this country.    The Committee desire to express their, appreciation of the valuable services ren-dered by the following gentlemen : Mr. C. S. Hurst, Ministry of Labour, Secretary to Joint Committee.Mr. C. B.  Hawkins, Ministry  of  Labour.Mr. Henry Clay, Ministry of Labour.Mr. G. T. Reid, Trade Boards.  Secretaries      to sub-Committees.Mr. J. McKie BryceMr. A. Macfarlane.  I        Secretaries  toMr. F.

APPENDIX   I.MEMORANDUM  ON THE  CAUSES OF  AND  REMEDIES  FOR   LABOUR UNREST, PRESENTED BY  THE   TRADE  UNION   REPRESENTATIVES ON THE JOINT COMMITTEE APPOINTED   AT THE NATIONAL  INDUSTRIAL  CONFERENCE, HELD AT   THE  CENTRAL HALL,  LONDON,  ON  FEBRUARY  27th,   1919.
                       I.-THE   CAUSES  OF  UNREST.     No one can doubt  the existence in the United Kingdom at the present  time  of the  most widespread and deep-seated  unrest that has  ever  been  known  in  this country.  The causes of this unrest do not admit of any  simple  and comprehensive explanation.   They are various and diverse and different causes take  the  first place in  different  districts and among different groups of  workers.   The  main  out- lines are, however,  sufficiently  distinct  to admit of  certain broad  and  general conclusions,  and this memorandum is an attempt to describe some of the most impor- tant causes so far as they relate to economic conditions.   No attempt will be made to deal with causes of a political character, although it is  impossible  to  separate  these completely from economic causes.   Thus, the representation of Labour in Parliament not only has a political  aspect, but also provides, under favourable conditions, the best possible safeguard  for a constitutional ventilation  of economic grievances, and  the under-representation of Labour in the present House of Commons must therefore be classed, to this extent, among the  economic factors, as well as  among the political factors, in unrest.   It must be remembered that throughout the war the workers have&quot;been led to expect  that  the conclusion of hostilities would be followed by a profound revolution in the economic structure  of society.     Not only social theorists, but also the most prominent spokesmen of the Government, and not a  few employers, have constantly told the  workers that we should never revert to the old conditions of industry and that an altogether  higher standard of life and an altogether  superior status for the worker in industry would be  secured as soon as the immediate burden of hostilities was removed.  The Prime Minister himself has urged an official deputation from the Labour Party to be  audacious, and the promises of  drastic  industrial change made  by the Government are too numerous to chronicle.   The Prime Ministers own words to the Labour Party Deputation are worth quoting.   He said:           &quot; I am not afraid of the audacity of these proposals.    I believe  the settle-     ment after the war will succeed in proportion  to  its  audacity. .  .  .  Therefore,     what I should be  looking forward to, I am certain, if I  could have presumed to     have been the  adviser of the working classes,  would be this : I should say to them     audacity is the thing for you.   Think out new ways; think out new methods;     think out even new ways of dealing with old problems.  Don&apos;t always be think-     ing of  getting back to where you were before the war; get a really new world.&quot;     In view of the attitude now adopted by the Government in regard  to industrial reconstruction, these words of the&apos;Prime Minister must be regarded as a material cause of Labour unrest.                             1. Lack  of  Policy.     At the present moment the workers find themselves face to face with disappoint- ment.  There is  also no sign that any comprehensive policy has been  prepared, or even contemplated, by the Government or by the Employers, with  a view to bringing about any drastic change in industry. Everywhere  the workers find either  the  deter- mination to revert as soon as possible to pre-war  conditions in the operation  of com- merce and manufacture, or, where the question of reverting to pre-war conditions does not arise or concerns primarily Labour, they find  that few, if any, preparations have been made for the  introduction of real changes.    The lack of  any  comprehensive industrial or economic policy on the part of the  Government or the employers must therefore be regarded as one of the principal factors in the present Labour unrest.                         2.-The Control of Industry.     With increasing vehemence  Labour is challenging the whole structure of capital- ist  industry as it now exists.   It is no longer willing to acquiesce  in a system  under which industry is conducted for the benefit of the few.   It demands a system of indus- trial control  which shall be truly democratic in character.   This is seen on the one hand in the demand for public ownership of vital industries and services and public control of services not nationalised which threaten the  public  with  the danger  of monopoly or exploitation.  It  is also seen in the increasing demand of the  workers in all industries for a real share in  industrial control, a  demand  which  the  Whitley scheme, in so  far as it  has been  adopted, has done little or nothing to satisfy.  This
demand is more articulate in some industries than others.   It is seen clearly in thenational programmes of the railwaymen and of the miners; and it is less clearly formu-Jated by the workers in many other industries.  The workers are no longer prepared to acquiesce  in a system in which their labour is  bought and sold as a commodity in theLabour market.   They  are  beginning  to assert that they have  a human right to an equal and democratic partnership in industry; that they must  be treated  in future not as &quot; hands &quot;  or part of the factory equipment, but as human beings with a right to use their  abilities by hand and brain  in  the service not of the few but of the whole community.     The  extent to which workers are  challenging  the  whole system of  industrial organisation  is very much greater to-day than ever  before,  and unrest proceeds notonly from more immediate and special  grievances but also, to an increasing extent, froma desire to substitute a democratic system of public ownership  and production for use with an increasing element of control by the organised workers  themselves  for  theexisting capitalist organisation of industry.                               3.-High  Prices.    Among the more immediate and special causes of industrial unrest the high pricesprevailing for commodities of common consumption take a prominent place.   high prices in themselves cause industrial unrest since the attempt is seldom, if ever, madeto readjust wages to a higher cost of living until the workers themselves strongly presstheir demands.  The fact that the onus of securing concessions which are necessaryeven to maintain Labour in its present  position is  always thrown upon the  workers, andthat strong resistance is practically always offered  by the employers  to such readjust-ments is a standing provocation to unrest, and has been a very material factor duringthe time of increasing prices through which we have been passing.   Moreover, theworkers are convinced that the high prices which have prevailed have not been un-avoidable  or purely due  to natural causes.  From the very beginning of the war period the Labour Movement has pressed upon the Government  the adoption  of  measures designed to keep down the cost of living, and  although control over private  industry has been gradually extended, it has, in  most cases, not been sufficiently thorough or hasbeen instituted far too late to check materially the  rising prices, and certainly too late to prevent the amassing of huge fortunes at the public expense.   The system of con-trol which has operated  during the war has meant, in the majority of  cases, the fixing of prices at a level which will give what is regarded as a reasonable margin of profit tothe least efficient concern, and this has meant, in case after case,  the fixing of  prices which leave an entirely unnecessary balance of profit to the more fortunately situatedor more efficient establishments.  In these circumstances, unrest arises and the workers are strongly convinced that the only way of keeping down prices is by taking productionand distribution into the hands of the public itself so that the price can be fixed at such a level as to be fair in the aggregate and so that gains and losses can be distributed over thewhole supply of each product.  The fact then that control  by the  State has usuallybeen instituted too late, and the further fact that, even when it has been put into opera-tion, it has not had the effect of reducing prices because  the  motive  of private profithas still been preserved, must be regarded as a  most potent factor in  aggravatingunrest and confirming working class suspicions of widespread profiteering.                               4.-Profiteering.    The universal opinion among the working&apos; classes that profiteering has taken place during the war on an unprecedented scale must also be reckoned as one of, the mostimportant causes of unrest.   It is, of course, impossible to produce an accurate state-ment of the extent and character of this profiteering, but an indication is  given in theenclosures of the type of fact reported in the newspapers which has been a  powerfulinfluence inconvincingthepublicthatwidespread profiteering is prevalent. (See enclosuresappended.)   Indications have  pointed to the fact that large fortunes have been amassedas a result of the war by many sections among tjie employing and financial classes.The following indications are those which have principally led to the impression thatextensive profiteering has been prevalent:     a. The reports in  the newspapers of dividends, distribution of  bonus shares, dis-         tribution of dividends higher than pre-war dividends after payment of excess
        profits duty,  and other reports showing- that the prosperity  of  well-known        firms is greater than ever before as a result of the war.    b. The impression that large profits beyond those  actually declared  in the form        of dividends or bonus shares have been accumulated by -one or another of the        following methods:--        The placing of exceptionally large sums to the reserve beyond the increase in             depreciation  necessitated  by war conditions.        The equipment, by grant or out of excess  profits at the public  expense, of             new factories, etc., or the  re-equipment of old ones, which will be in a             position to  earn high profits after the war.    c. The impression that the excess profits tax has operated not so as to reduce the        total amount of profit obtained by the large concerns  which  have been in a        position to secure almost what prices they chose to ask for their commodities,        but to increase  prices and thereby maintain profits at the same height as they        would have reached if there had been no excess profits  taxation.    d. The constant references in Government reports and in the newspapers, giving        accounts of the progress of combination among firms which have led to the        impression that  &quot;vested interests&quot; are becoming more powerful  in the com-        munity than ever, and that there is a  serious danger of a great extension of        private monopolies  prejudicial to the public,  and  that the  Government  is        steadily fostering combination among capitalists without adequate safeguards        for the public interest.    e. The fact  that huge combinations of capitalists  have been formed during the        war for  the express purpose of influencing the Government, and the impres-        sion that these combinations are listened to with far more attention by Gov-        ernment Departments, than the representations made by Labour.    This list by no means exhausts the causes which have led the workers to believethat widespread profiteering exists,  but it would be impossible  to carry  the   matter further without entering into considerable detail.  It need only be said that profiteeringin articles of working-class consumption, such as food, naturally produces a  more immediate and profound  impression in working class circles than profiteering  which,although it may be even more extensive, is not equally apparent to the ordinary manor woman.   The work of the Ministry of Food and  of  the  Consumers&apos; Council has done something to diminish the suspicion among the workers of  food profiteering, butthis suspicion is rapidly reviving as a beginning is made of the removal  of food control.              5.-Government  Policy  in  Relation  to Industry.    The actions of the Government in  relation to industry since the general electionhave deepened the working class impression that profiteering is prevalent.  The saleof national ships, shipyards, and factories is strongly resented by Labour, especially as this has taken place at a moment when the  ships  might have  been made  of  thegreatest use, in national hands, both in relieving the necessities  of the world and  in preventing the creation of powerful shipping monopolies.   The  shipyards might havebeen used to increase and develop a national  mercantile marine, and the  factories, aswell as the shipyards, might have been  turned to the task of useful peace-time produc-tion, and might have been  made a powerful factor  for the  prevention  of  unemploy-ment both during the period of dislocation and permanently.  The words  used by theMinister of  Labour at the  Industrial Conference on February  27th  have intensifiedLabour&apos;s misgivings.   Sir Robert  Home said:          &quot; The consideration which ultimately weighed with the Government was that     the only chance of expediting matters at the present time was to restore confidence     in private enterprise. ...  If the Government was regarded as a competitor in the     industries which  private enterprise  was  at present running they would never get     proper work started again at all.&quot;     This is by no means the view of Labour,  which holds strongly that the develop-ment of national  resources under public ownership is the most urgent  need of industry at the present time.  The eagerness  of the Government to sell the national property and its expressed determination to compete in no way with private interests in the task of production, even on such commodities as telephones which  are  required  by  the
Government itself in large numbers, and the hasty abandoning of national control overindustry, without any adequate safeguards for the future protection of the consumer,have led the workers to the view that the Governments first concern is the  restriction of public ownership  and the restoration, at all costs, of the system, of production for private profit.   Moreover, the  refusal of the Government to  come to  any decision onthe question of mine and railway nationalisation, despite definite promises made duringthe general election and although the solution of this question is obviously vital to theproblem of industrial reconstruction as a whole, seems to  show that  no  constructiveindustrial policy can be expected.  Thus, disillusionment and fear of exploitation in thefuture on an unprecedented scale has made the  workers think that their  only remedylies in taking matters into their own hands.                              6. Unemployment.    The prevention  of unemployment and provision against imemployment  shouldhave been one of the first thoughts of the Government as soon as the question of indus-tnal reorganisation began to be considered.  The workers fully understood that steps were being taken to bring into immediate operation upon the conclusion of hostilities  apermanent scheme both  for the prevention of unemployment wherever  possible and forthe maintenance of the unemployed where this could not be done.  They now find thatno permanent  provision  has been made,  and that the Government actually proposes towithdraw the temporary  provision for the unemployed before instituting any permanentsystem of prevention and maintenance.  The reduction of the unemployment donationbefore a  comprehensive  and permanent scheme of prevention and provision has beenbrought into operation, will have the effect of extending and increasing unrest.   More-over, the administration of the unemployment donation has given considerable cause for dissatisfaction, especially in the case of women, who are  being compelled  in caseafter case to take jobs in sweated industries  practically at pre-war rates of wages.     We are of the opinion that the unequal distribution of wealth which prior to thewar kept the purchasing  power of the majority of the wage earners at a low level consti-tuted a  primary cause of unemployment.   During the Labour unrest debate  in theHouse of Commons, February, 1912, the  Parliamentary Secretary to the. Board ofTrade stated that the department had particulars of wages paid  to 7,300,000  work-people,  and further informed the Hous^ that 60 per cent, of the wage earners for whom they had particulars were receiving less than 30s. per week.   From the Land EnquiryCommittee Report, published in 1913, we learn that about 60 per cent, of the ordinaryadult agricultural labourers received less than 18s. per week, a substantial percentagebeing in receipt of less  than 15s. per week.     In  1911 the Government appointed a  Royal Commission to investigate the causeof a dispute affecting railway employees.   The  Union  representatives  subniitted  astatement showing the rates  of wages for railway war workers in 1906, as foil ows:      No. receiving  1  per zveek or less.     ... Per Cent, of total number employed.     England and Wales      ...  81,300    ............     36.7     Scotland    ...     ...     ...  12,960    ...     ...    ,..    ...     45.2     Ireland      ...     ......   6,650    ...     ...    .;.....74.5     Showing  over 100,000 workers employed in an  industry  not effected by  foreigncompetition not exceeding   1 per week.     Sir  G. S. Barnes, Second  Secretary, Board of Trade,  giving  evidence before  a select Committee of the House of Commons in 1913, supplied the following particulars of wages paid to women workers.     In the Sugar Confectionery trades 40.5 per cent, were receiving less than  10s. perweek, with an average wage of us. 9d. Food preserving 44.4,  with an average of10s. 1 id.  The women employed in the hollow-ware trade to the number of 700 havebeen on strike to obtain  a minimum wage of 10s. for a week of 54 hours.     In  the calendering and machine ironing trade, of the women over 18 years of ageworking full time 32 per cent,  earned under 10s.,  and the average was us.  4d. fora 60-hours week.     The above  particulars  of wages paid covering  Railway Workers, agricultural labourers, and a large percentage of women workers indicate that a very large body of wage earners have received a rate of wages limiting their power of consumption to suchan extent as seriously to limit the effective demand for all the  essentials of life, and asa  consequence unemployment has been created by under consumption.
  vi.                 APPENDIX-TRADE  UNION MEMORANDUM.                          7.-Wages and  Earnings.    The termination of hostilities caused a sudden reduction in the earnings, though not in the wage rates, of huge classes of workers, without any corresponding decreasein the cost of living.   This has, no doubt, to some extent intensified  the  unrest, butwage grievances are not, at the present time, responsible for more than a fraction of  it.At the same time there are two aspects of the wages problem in connection with whichthe uncertainty of the present position is already causing serious unrest.    i. Most classes  of workers have put forward demands for wage increases and the         incorporation in wages  of war advances, with a view not merely to maintain-         ing their pre-war position in  relation to the  increased cost of living, but  to         improving their economic position.   Failure to  satisfy the universal demand         of  the workers for a higher standard of life will undoubtedly be  followed by         widespread  unrest.   This applies not only to the highly organised, but also  to         the less organised groups of workers.  It is the universal opinion among the         workers that every worker, no matter what the trade or occupation with which         he  or she is connected,  is entitled to a reasonable minimum standard of life,         and  that the existing  slow  and cumbrous  methods of dealing  with  this         problem by the gradual and piece-meal extension of the Trade Boards  Act,         in  face of persistent obstruction and opposition, are entirely  inadequate.    2. The  Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act is due to expire in May. Unless steps         are taken to renew it until permanent provision has been made for  dealing         with  wage  rates in the  future, unrest will be gravely increased.                            8.-Hours of  Labour.    Probably the most important immediate cause of unrest is  the question of hoursof labour. i Hours have been singularly little changed for a very long time past, and before the war demands were being made in many industries for a substantial reduc-tion.  The workers are now  urgently demanding a higher standard of leisure, to beachieved by  a reduction in working hours and%e abolition of systematic overtime.  Ifmatters  are allowed to drift,  these demands  will lead to  serious  unrest and possiblydislocation in  practically  every industry in the country.    There is a  strong opinion among the workers that the  hours problem  should be dealt with  as a whole with a viewto the formulation of some maximum  limit  applicable to all workers.  Otherwise hoursof labour will take a prominent place in encouraging unrest for a long time  to come.                                 9. Housing.     Side by side with the demand for a higher standard  of life and leisure comes thedemand for more and better housing accommodation.   Overcrowding  has been anespecially serious factor in the creation of unrest  in  many centres during the  war period, and attention was drawn to this point in the reports on Industrial Unrest pre-pared for  the  Government  two  years ago.  . .  . The rapidly  growing  shortage ofnouses at the present time, and the failure to build new houses, have done a great deal to undermine working  class  confidence, and must now rank among the principal factorsof unrest.                      10. Recognition  of Trade  Unions.    More than one dispute recently has centred around the question of the recognitionof trade unionism.  Among Government employees the Police Union has been refusedrecognition, and serious unrest has thereby been caused.   The Railway Clerks&apos; Asso-ciation only secured partial recognition from the Government by the threat of  animmediate strike, and even now serious trouble is being caused by  the attempts of  theRailway Executive Committee and the companies to whittle down this recognition.There has been serious delay in applying the Whitley  Committee&apos;s Report  to  any
section of Government employees, and even now it has not been applied to the CivilService, with the result that this class of workers is in a grave state of unrest. Amongemployees of private firms recognition is still by no means completely or fully estab-lished a point which has been specially brought to our notice by one Association, thatof the Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen, which, although it includes prac-tically all the  draughtsmen eligible for membership, is still refused recognition.   Re-cognition  is  still especially defective in the workshops, and it is clear that the failure to provide for full recognition of Trade Union Organisation in and out of the work-shops is responsible for a good deal of unrest.                   11.-Lack  of  Representative  Machinery.    One reason why the existing unrest in industry lacks co-ordination and is difficultto express in concrete terms is that there exists no  adequate  machinery capable  ofgiving constant expression to the co-ordinated demands of  the whole of the workers.Numerous Committees and  Conferences have been set up and summoned by the Gov-ernment for various industrial and economic purposes.   These  have  mostly  beenunsatisfactory and often of an unrepresentative character. There is an urgent demandfor an elective  body fully representative of Labour  to advise the  Government   oneconomic and industrial policy in general.   The absence of such a body is certainly oneof the causes for the rapid extension of the present  industrial  unrest  and  for   itstaking in some cases an indefinite and incoherent form.   Until  some such really repre-sentative body is brought into existence it is to be feared that unrest will continue to possess a disorganised and  largely unco-ordinated  character.        12. The  Attitude  of the  Government  and  the Employers.    It is not possible to discuss the question of Labour unrest without drawing atten-tion to one important factor, both as causing of unrest and as making it take unconsti-tutional directions.   It is unfortunately the fact that it has been much more difficult toget prompt attention to industrial grievances during the war period in those cases inwhich the workers, from patriotic motives, have remained at work and endeavoured toact by constitutional methods than where they have  come out on strike  or threatenedimmediate and drastic action.  This suicidal policy of delaying remedial action forgrievances until the workers have decided to  take matters  into  their own  hands  is responsible for a great deal of preventable unrest, and there is a general opinion that both employers and the Government would be wise to take  steps to ensure  that &quot;infuture, grievances, as soon as they arise and  before they reach the point of danger,should be promptly considered and dealt with on sympathetic lines.                      II.-REMEDIES  FOR   UNREST.    To the foregoing statement we append certain general suggestions as to remedies.We shall follow,  as far as  possible, in our discussion of remedies the  order  of the paragraphs setting out the  causes of unrest.                           1.-Control  of  Industry.     (a) A  substantial  beginning must be made of instituting public ownership of the vital industries and services in this country.  Mines and the supply of coal, railways,docks, and other means of transportation, the supply of electric power, and shipping,at least so  far as ocean-going  services are concerned, should be at once nationalised.     (b) Private profit  should be entirely eliminated  from the  manufacture  of  arma-ments, and the amount of nationalisation necessary to secure this should be introduced into  the engineering,  shipbuilding, and kindred industries.     (c) There should  be a great extension of municipal ownership, and ownership byother local authorities  and co-operative control of those services which are concerned primarily with the supplying of local needs.
  viii.                 APPENDIX TRADE  UNION  MEMORANDUM.    (d) Key industries and services should at once be publicly owned.    if) This extension of public ownership over vital industries should  be  accom-panied by the granting to the organised workers of the greatest practicable  amount ofcontrol  over the conditions and the management of the various industries.                          2.-State  Control  and  Prices.    (a) Where an industry producing articles of common  consumption  or materialsnecessary to industries producing articles of common consumption cannot be at oncepublicly owned, State control over such industries should be retained.    (b) State control has been  shown to provide some check upon profiteering  and high prices,  and this is a reason  why it should be maintained until industries pass  into ,the stage at  which they can  be conveniently nationalised.    if) Many groups of capitalists at the present time are loudly claiming State assis-tance in re-establishing  their industries  upon a profit-making basis.  There must be noState assistance without strict State control.                                3.-Profiteering.    ia) A determined attempt should be made in  each  industry by public  inquirythrough Royal Commissions to elicit all the  facts with  regard to war profiteering.    (b) Organised Labour in each industry or service should have the right of nominat-ing half the membership of the  Commission, the other half being appointed by theGovernment to represent interests similar to  those  represented by the  Governmentnominees on the Coal Commission.  The Government should also, in each case, appointi Chairman.  This principle should be adopted not only  in constituting these Commis-sions,  but  also  in  the  other  Committees  and  Commissions  proposed  in  thismemorandum.    if) Such an inquiry  should include  not only firms directly engaged in industrial production, but also subsidiary and trading concerns, and that a comprehensive attempt should be made to discover the extent  and effect of combination between firms, andto lay bare any tendencies towards monopolistic combination  which  are  at  presentdeveloping  in British Industry.    id) In view of the enormous burden of debt which has been accumulated as a resultof- the war and of the methods adopted in financing the war by loan rather than by direct taxation, steps  should at once be taken to  remove  a  considerable part  of  this burden by a graduated levy on capital from which property up to , 1,000 would be exempt.            4.-Government  Policy  in  Relation to  Industry.    The policy of selling national factories, ships  and  shipyards  should  be imme-diately reversed, and both the ships and the shipyards and factories should be resumedby the State and operated as national concerns in the interest of the whole community.                5.-Unemployment,  Security and Maintenance.     (a) We are of the opinion that a general increase in wages by improving the pur-         chasing power  of the workers would  have a general  and permanent effect in         the direction of limiting continuous unemployment, by bringing consumption         up to something more like equilibrium with production.     (b) A special commission  should be appointed immediately to investigate andreport within a specified limit of time, upon the whole problem of unemployment in the widest sense, and the attention of ihis Commission should be especially directed to theproblem of under consumption as a cause of unemployment, and the possibility of insti-tuting a State bonus.     if) Pending the report of this Commission the Government should at once addressitself to the  task of preventing  unemployment by all means within its power.
     (d) We strongly urge the immediate creation of a central authority to deal withthe allocation of all Government contracts in such a way as to steady the volume  ofemployment and to co-ordinate orders given by local authorities. This central authority should co-operate closely with the National Industrial Council.     ((?) A  complete and comprehensive scheme of unemployment provision extending to all workers on a non-contributory basis should be instituted at the earliest possible moment, and this scheme should provide for adequate maintenance of those workers who are unemployed, and for the making up of maintenance pay to those workers whoare under  employed.  All unemployed workpeople under such a scheme  would  beentitled to a flat rate of benefit.  It would, however, be desirable that there should be,in addition to the flat rate, a supplementary allowance for dependent children.     (/) This scheme should be administered  directly through the trade unions,  theGovernment maintenance pay for the unemployed being handed over in the form of asubvention to the various trade unions to administer on behalf of  their own members.Where in any case direct administration, through a trade  union is not arranged, main-tenance pay should be administered through the Employment Exchanges,  but if sucha system of administration is to carry any confidence the present  organisation of  theEmployment Exchanges must  be drastically remodelled, and the Exchanges must beplaced  under  the  direct control of Joint Committees equally representative of theemployers  and  trade unions.     (g) In  addition  to  the  provision made  under such  non-contributory national scheme  the  State  should  assist  Trade  Unions  to provide  an  additional  benefit  out  of  their  own  funds by giving  a  subsidy from State funds equivalent to 50per cent, of the amount expended by the Union on  unemployment allowances.    (h)  Until this permanent provision is brought fully into operation it will be essen-tial to continue, at least  on  the original scale, the temporary system of unemployment donation instituted on the -ermination of hostilities.     (i)  It is  absolutely necessary to make  provision for a greater degree of security onthe part of the  worker.  The worker who  is threatened with arbitrary dismissal should,in all cases, have a prior right of appeal to his fellow workers, and wherever dismissaltakes place on  grounds other than those of demonstrated misconduct, the worker whois dismissed should be entitled to a payment proportionate to his period of service withthe firm.     (j) Special provision should be made for the maintenance of widows with depen-dent children, and for the endowment of mothers, in order to prevent them from being forced into industry against  the&apos;interest of society.                                  6. Wages.     (a)  A higher standard of living for the  whole  working community  is  not  onlydesirable but immediately possible.     (b)  Every  worker should be entitled by law to a reasonable minimum wage.    \c)  Until full provisions securing this  to all workers have been brought into actualand complete operation, the temporary system of regulating wages under the Wages(Temporary Regulation) Act should continue.     (d) The principle of equal pay for men and women should be universally applied,both on grounds of justice and in order that there may be  no degrading of conditionsin any occupation through the introduction of female labour.                              7.-Hours of  Labour.    (a)  A universal reduction of hours to a  maximum of eight in  any one day, and 44in, any one week, is immediately necessary, subject only to such modifications in par-ticular industries or occupations as can be  clearly proved  to be necessary for the effi-cient carrying on of the service.  All such modifications should be allowed only  on condition that the terms secured to the workers in the industries so exempted from the strict operation  of an Eight-Hour Act should be not less favourable on the whole thanthe terms accorded to workers under the Act.
     (b) Power should at once be taken to reduce the number of hours worked beloweight by a simple procedure such as that of provisional order as soon as industry hasbeen given time to readjust itself to the  new conditions.     (c) The eight hours  which should  be made a legal maximum for  all  workers should not prevent the workers in any trade or industry either  from maintaining anybetter conditions which they have already secured,  or  from securing better conditionsin the  future.     (d) Power should be taken in any Act regulating hours where a collective agree-ment has  been arrived at  between representative organisations securing a lower maxi-mum of hours  for a particular trade or  occupation, to make this lower maximum com-pulsory for the whole trade, including those parts  of it which  are  unorganised  orunfederated.     (e) Any measure regulating the hours of labour should also include provisions forthe prohibition of all systematic overtime, and for the payment of all overtime workedat special rates.                         4     if)  Special rates of pay should apply also  to  night work,  Sunday, and holidaywork, and night  work should be  abolished absolutely  for women and children and,wherever possible, for all workers.     (g) Steps should immediately be taken for the international regulation  of  thehours of labour, and for the inclusion of a universal maximum  in the  terms of  theInternational Charter of  Labour.     ih) The fact that a trade has not reached a high state of organisation should not beregarded as an excuse for long hours or bad conditions of employment.                                  8.-Housing.     (a) The housing of the people must be regarded as a national responsibility, andthe national resources must be utilised to the fullest extent in order to secure the imme-diate provision of enough houses to ensure a great general  improvement in housing conditions for the whole people     (b) If local authorities  fail, under  the conditions now offered by the  State, toprovide houses, the  State must itself at once assume the responsibility of providing the houses which  are necessary, or of compelling the local authorities to do so.     if) Far more regard must be given than in the past both to the conditions whichare necessary for the maintenance of public health and to convenience and comfort ofthe working class household and especially of the housewife.     (d) Provision must be made for the  fullest participation  of working class   repre-sentatives, including women, directly chosen by the workers, in seeing that this schemeis carried  properly and completely into effect.                       9. Recognition of Trade Unions.    All trade unions and federations and associations of trade unions recognised bythe Labour Movement itself must receive full recognition both from the employers andfrom the State and the local authorities.                  10. Creation  of Representative  Machinery.      Some national machinery fully representative of the employers and of Labour to.  advise the Government in relation to all issues affecting industry generally should be  brought into being at  the earliest possible moment.  This body should possess the full  confidence of Labour,  and should have the most democratic constitution that can pos -  sibly be secured.   Without interfering where adequate machinery already exists, such  an industrial  council would form  a useful medium for negotiation on questions affect-.  ing mutual  relations of employers  and workers in general, and  on  all  questions of  general industrial and economic policy.
                                CONCLUSIONS.    The fundamental causes of Labour unrest are to be found rather in the growingdetermination of Labour to challenge the  whole existing structure of capitalist indus-try than in  any of the more special and smaller grievances which come to the surfaceat any particular time.    These  root causes are twofold the breakdown  of  the existing capitalist systemof industrial organisation, in the sense that the mass of the working class is now firmlyconvinced that production for private profit is not an equitable basis on which to build,and that a vast extension of public ownership and democratic control of  industry is urgently necessary.   It is no longer possible for organised Labour to be controlled by force  or compulsion of any kind.  It has grown too strong to remain within the boundsof the old industrial system and  its unsatisfied demand  for the.  re-organisation  ofindustry on democratic lines is not only the most important,  but  also  a  constantlygrowing cause of unrest.                          *    The second primary cause  is closely linked with the first.   It is that, desiring thecreation of  a new industrial system which shall gradually but speedily replace the old,the workers can see no indication that either the Government or the employers  haverealised the necessity for any fundamental change, or that they are prepared even tomake  a beginning of industrial  re-organisation on more  democratic  principles.   Theabsence of  any constructive policy on the side  of the Government or the  employers,taken in  conjunction with the fact that Labour, through the Trades Union congress and the Labour Party and through the various  Trade Union Organisations, has putforward  a  comprehensive economic and industrial  programme, has  presented theworkers with  a sharp contrast from  which  they naturally draw their own deductions.    It is clear that unless and until  the Government is prepared to realise the need forcomprehensive reconstruction on a democratic basis,  and to  formulate  a constructivepolicy leading towards economic democracy, there can be at most no more than a tem-porary diminution of industrial unrest to be followed  inevitably by  further waves ofconstantly  growing  magnitude.    The changes involved in this reconstruction must, of course, be gradual,  but  ifunrest is to be prevented from  assuming dangerous forms an  adequate  assurance *      11.-The  Attitude  of  the Government  and  of  the  Employers.    -(a)  A drastic change in the attitude of the Government Departments which dealwith Labour is essential.    (b)  It should be regarded as the duty of any Government Department employingLabour  or entering  into contracts which involve the employment of Labour, to ensurefor all workers in its  direct or indirect employment an adequate standard of life, andthe best possible conditions  of employment.    (c)  Any claim or  demand put forward by a body of workers should be immediatelyattended to, whether or not a strike has taken place and whether or not notice of strikehas been given, without waiting for the organised workers to demonstrate their deter-mination to take action.  The  Government should aim at being beforehand with unrestby removing all legitimate grievances as soon as they arise    (d) The indefensible delay of the Ministry of Labour in setting up Trade Boardsmust come to an end,  and the  machinery of  the Trade Boards Act must  be put intooperation at once  for all the less organised trades and occupations.    (e)  The employer, if  he desires to prevent Labour  unrest, should regard  it aspart of his responsibility to secure to all the workers whom he employs the best possibleconditions of life  and  the earliest possible removal of all grievances.   &apos; (/)  The habitual  use now made by employers of machinery of conciliation  and negotiation for the  purpose of  delaying the  settlement of industrial demands must be discontinued.    (g) It is essential that  all machinery of  negotiation should  be capable of  rapidoperation, and that  it should in no case be used for the purpose of delaying a decision,and that with a view to ensuring that it will not be so used all awards and agreements should be made retrospective to the date of the original claim.
must be given,immediately to the workers that  the  whole  problem  is  being   takencourageously in hand.   It is  not enough merely to tinker with particular grievances, orto endeavour to reconstruct the old  system by slight adjustments to meet the new de-mands of Labour.   It is  essential  to question the whole basis  on which our industry has been conducted in the past and  to endeavour to find, in  substitution for the motiveof private gain, some other motive which will serve better as the foundation of a demo-cratic system.   This motive can be  no other  than the  motive of public  service,  whichat present  is  seldom invoked save  when the  workers threaten to stop the  process ofproduction by a strike.  The  motive of public service should be  the  dominant motivethroughout the whole industrial system, and  the problem in industry at the present day is that of bringing home  to every person engaged in industry the feeling that he is theservant, not  of  any particular  class or person,  but of the community as  a whole.  this cannot be done so long as industry  continues  to be conducted for private profit, and the widest possible extension of public ownership and democratic  control  of industry istherefore the first necessary condition of the  removal of industrial unrest.

Appended is a list  of a few firms in various industries, showing  the dividends declared on deferredand ordinary stocks.    Those afford a rough measure of prosperity; no complete indication can be given without an exhaustive examination of the concern&apos;s  finances.  Thus the  actual prosperity  may be  lower,if no dividends,  or lower dividends,  have  been  declared  in  previous  years,  or  if  the ordinary  sharesrepresent  a relatively small portion  of the capital  employed  on  the other  hand, low dividends may becoincident with very  large profits,  where these are  placed to reserve, or capitalised as bonus-shares.&quot;  Anincrease in dividend,  however, pretty definitely  indicates a definite increase in prosperity, though the cor-responding inference cannot be drawn from a decrease in dividend.  In the list given below an x denotesthat the dividends are free of income-tax.Shipping. -See Special  Table.Coal and  Iron and Steel Companies .2.    Pearson  Knowles and Co., 45 per cent. (1918).

Many companies  have recently capitalised  reserves by isuing bonus-shares to  the shareholders, eitherfree, or at a price below the market value.  In this way money that has been accumulated as reserve fundsis  distributed to  the  shareholders,  and begins to  earn dividends at the same rate as the ordinary  shares.Thus Brunner Monds  declared a dividend of 27J- per  cent, for  several years, in        they issued bonus-shares, and declared only  a dividend of  11  per cent,  the following year, although the amount  received bythe shareholders  was  exactly  the same as before.

APPENDIX   II PROVISIONAL   SCHEME  FOR  TRADE  UNION  REPRESENTATION  ON                 THE  NATIONAL  INDUSTRIAL  COUNCIL.     The following scheme consists of two parts-first,  a  series of rules  intended tq govern the election of the Trade Union Representatives on the National Industrial Council, and, secondly, a schedule  giving the actual proposed basis of representation for the first year&apos;s election.  Obviously, if a Council consisting of precisely 200 mem bers is to be elected each  year,  the number of members entitling a society to  repre-1 sentation must vary in accordance with the fluctuations in total Trade  Union member- ship.  Thus, if 20,000 is a suitable  minimum figure entitling a society to representation when the gross membership of all Trade Unions is approximately 6,000,000, the figure might have to  be  raised to 25,000 or  30,000 if there were a general increase  in the membership of Trade Unions,  It  is suggested, therefore, that the figures in the first; part of the following draft should be revised annually by the Standing Committee of the Council, in accordance with the  total Trade Union membership as shown  in the annual returns made to the Ministry of Labour.  This  scheme is based approximately upon the following principles:      1.  Each Union with more than 20,000 members is entitled to separate representa- tion on the following basis one representative for each  complete 20,000 members up to 100,000, and one representative  for each further 50,000 after the first  100,000.    - 2. Any federation may, with the consent of the unions forming the federation, be represented  on the same numerical  basis, provided that no Union&apos;s membership may be counted  twice  over in whole or in part, whether through two federations or once through a federation and once on its own behalf.     3. The Societies are grouped in the following 20 groups :          (1) Mining and Quarrying.                           *         (2) Railways.         (3) Other Transport.         (4) Iron  and Steel Trades.                       &apos;.&apos;         (5) Engineering and Foundry Workers.         (6) Shipyards.         (7) Building and Woodworking.         (8) Printing and  Paper.         (9) Cotton.        (10) Other Textiles.        (11) Boot and  Shoe and Leather.        (12) Clothing.                                               .......        (13) Food Trades.        (14) Distributive Trades.        (15) Agriculture.        (16) Clerks and Agents.        (17) Government Employees.        (18) General Labour.        (19) Women Workers.        (20) Miscellaneous Trades.     4. In each group the unions which do not secure representation directly or through a federation  shall, if the aggregate membership  which they represent in  any  group exceeds 20,000, be entitled to elect one representative and one further representa-tive for each further complete 20,000, provided that, if in  any group the membership ofthe union concerned does not reach 20,000, the union thus excluded from representationwithin the group shall be entitled to vote in group 20.     5. Any  union or federation  which.is entitled  to direct representation  may  deter-mine for itself, according to its own  constitution, its  manner of choosing its repre1sentative or  representatives.
     6.  The representatives of the grouped  societies shall be chosen by special meet-ings of delegates  from the societies concerned in each group, the votes being propor-tionate  to the number of members represented.     7.  In determining the membership of any union or federation for the purposes of representation, the last annual returns to the Ministry of  Labour shall  be  taken  as showing the membership.     8.  All representatives  shall be  elected, annually and  shall be  eligible  for re-election.     9.  Any case of doubt concerning the group to which a union or federation shouldbe  assigned shall be  determined by  the Trade Union side of the National IndustrialCouncil or of  the Standing  Committee.     10. In side meetings of the Council the voting shall be on a  strictly numericalbasis..   -     11. For the first  election of the Council the grouping and representation shall  beas set out in the schedule hereto.  For subsequent elections  the basis of representationshall be determined by the Trade Union side of the Council itself on the advice of theTrade  Union side of the Standing Committee,  in  accordance with the figures of thelast preceding return to the Ministry of Labour, in accordance with clause  7.

  Report of the Committee of the  National Industrial Conference.Keraorantei by the Minister of Labour.           In forwarding my memorandum of the 1st April      on the above Report, I should explain that the Ministry      of Labour have invited the other Departments of the      Government which  are mainly concerned to express their      views on the proposals contained in the Report.  Replies      have not yet been received, but in view of the short      time available, I thought it necessary to consult the      Cabinet at once.
