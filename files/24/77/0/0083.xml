MEMORANDUM                               ON &apos;MAIN  EVENTS IN  THE RELATIONS  OF CHINA WITH JAPAN.                                   SlJMMAEY.    1. UP to the  era  of treaties with Western nations  (middle  of 19th century),there was little real intercourse between China and Japan.  The Chinese had alwaysconsidered themselves  the  superior  race;  the  Japanese  resented  this  Chineseassumption of superiority.    2. In modern times the  first serious question between them arose over Loochoo(1873).  In the end the Loochoo group was appropriated by Japan.    3. Rivalry in Korea  gave rise to the  Chmo-Japanese war  (1894-5).  The easydefeat of China in this conflict was the first step in the decline of the  Manchu Empire.    4. Anglo-Japanese Alliance, 1902.    5  Russian aggression in Manchuria  and Korea led to the  Russo-Japanese war(1904-5).   The result of this was to establish Japan firmly in both countries.    6. Japan entered  into engagements  with  France,  Russia, and America  for themaintenance  of the status quo in China (1907-8).    7. After the Russo-Japanese war the reform movement in  China  created a strong demand for Western  education, which was largely supplied from Japan.    8. In 1910 Japan and Russia  concluded  a  convention agreeing  to work together in Manchuria ;  and Korea was shortly afterwards annexed to Japan (August 1910).    9. Japan and the  Chinese revolution.  At first  Japan set her  face against theRepublic, but later she supported a Southern revolt against Yuan Shih-kai&apos;s govern-ment (1911-13).               ,                             V     10. In 1914 Kiaochow was captured,  and  Japan took the opportunity to make aseries of  extraordinary demands known as  &quot; The  Twenty-one  Demands&quot; uponChina (May 1915).     11. The hostility to  Yuan  Shih-kai&apos;s government continued up  to Yiian&apos;s death(6th June, 1916), and had much to do with it.   After Yiian&apos;s death Japan and Russiaconcluded a  treaty  of  alliance  to  safeguard  their  interests  in  the  Far East(3id July, 1916).   Japan  continued  to support the  South against  the North  up  to october 1917.  In that month an &quot; arms alliance &quot; was arranged with the North; and since then Japans policy has been to guide and  control  the  Northern faction, whiledoing nothing to actively oppose the South.Pre-Treaty Relations.    Before the advent of Western nations and their commerce, the foreign policies ofChina and Japan were  those of most oriental peoples to bring weaker neighbourswithin the orbit of their influence by a mild system of &quot; tribute,&quot; and to maintain the strictest precautions against  intercourse  with  little known or distant or powerfulnations.  For centuries neither had made any serious attack on the other.  The onlyimportant  attempt on Japan from China was the  unsuccessful Mongol expedition ofthe 13th century;  and the last instance of aggression  by Japan, other tin an  merepiratical raids, went back to the 16th century.  To a large extent the culture of japan had come from  China ;  for that reason, chiefly, the Chinese had  always consideredthemselves the  superior race, and their attitude towards the Japanese was mingledwith contempt and dislike.  But though the  contempt and dislike  was not so deep asthe same feelings of the Chinese towards Europeans, they reacted  on the Japanese,who especially resented this Chinese assumption of superiority.  When the Far east was first really  opened  to foreign intercourse  in  the  middle of  the 19th century,Japan and China had little to do  with  each  other, and, though in no  sense activeenemies, their relations could not be  considered  entirely friendly.

The Loochoo Suzerainty, 1873.    Japan was  the first  to  secure  advantage from the new communications withforeign countries, and as soon as she felt her feet in the novel conditions she began toassert herself more firmly with her neighbours.  The first notable dispute with  China in modern times arose over a  question of  suzerainty.   From  the Loochoo group,which extends between Japan  and Formosa, &quot;tribute missions&quot; had been sent regularly to china, though for at least two centuries the islands were considered in Japan to belong to the  Satsuma fief.   Apart from their proximity to Japan, the language and nationalcharacteristics siiowed affinities with the Japanese.   In 1873, the Japanese Governmentsought redress from China for barbarous treatment  suffered by the crew of a wreckedLoochoo vessel from natives of East Formosa.   As in all such matters, the Chinese paidlittle heed to the  complaints, and Japan, to placate the samurai of Satsuma, took thelaw into her own hands and sent troops to punish the Formosans.   Against  this act of force  in  her territories, China  protested, and hostile feeling  was aroused in both countries.  Largely by the good  offices of the British Minister in Peking, Sir ThomasWade,  the dispute was composed, and it was finally arranged  that the Japanese  troops should be withdrawn from Formosa on payment by China of the cost of the expedition.    Soon afterwards, when Japan extended her new form of administration in 1876 toLoochoo, which became the Okinawa prefecture, China, ignoring the precedent created by the Formosa expedition and its sequel, claimed Loochoo as a vassal. There the caserested Japan in possession and China remonstrating until 1880, when General Grant,who was  on a visit to East Asia, suggested a compromise.   Plenipotentiaries of the twocountries met in Peking to divide the islands, Japan to take the north group and china the south.  At the last moment,  the Chinese plenipotentiary was forbidden to sign theagreement which was reached, and the Japanese withdrew from the  conference.   Japanretained the islands and China let the matter drop.Korea.    About the same time as the  Loochoo question was under discussion,  the seeds of amore serious quarrel were being sown in Korea.  In 1866, Roman Catholic missionarieswere murdered in that country, and about the same time an American ship was destroyed in the Pingyang river (North  Korea).  When applied to by France and America, Chinadeclined  responsibility for the acts of her vassals, and  allowed  reprisals to be takenupon  Korea without protest.   These facts were noted by Japan, who commenced totake an active interest in her  near neighbour for reasons which took a deep root in thepast.   From the invasion of the Korean  peninsula by  Hideyoshi  in  the sixteenthcentury the Korean kings had  marked the  accession of the Japanese Shoguns  bymissions  of fecilitation, but these had ceased after the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate.From motives of policy, the  Korean Court retained the early objection  to intercoursewith foreign nations  or imitation of  foreigners  in  any shape or form, and  Japan was informed  that no relations could be maintained with a country  embracing Westerncivilisation.  An embassy  from Japan was also refused  reception.   This  contemptuousattitude was resented hotly, and must have caused a  rupture  with both  Korea  and china but for Japan&apos;s absorption in internal reforms at this period.  In 1875, however,a crisis was provoked by the  Koreans firing  on the boats of a Japanese  survey vessel.A squadron was assembled which overawed Korea, and a treaty was concluded in 1876,of which the first article declared that Korea was an &quot; independent State enjoying thesame  rights as Japan.&quot;   This being allowed to pass without  protest,  other nationsproceeded to conclude treaties with Korea on the same basis, and, seeing her mistake,China  now endeavoured  to have a declaration  added to each treaty by the King of korea  to show that he was a  tributary of China.    There was a traditional  enmity between  Koreans and Japanese, dating from theHideyoshi invasion, and it was not long  before the presence of  a Japanese envoy inresidence in Seoul gave rise  to conflict.  There was a party of progress, which soughtinspiration from  Japan, and  a larger conservative party, which relied  on China.  In1882, the King*&apos;s father was the prime mover in an outbreak during which the JapaneseLegation was attacked, and  the Japanese colony driven  to fly for their lives.  Chinainterposed to preserve order; the King&apos;s father was carried off in exile to China;. anda strong Chinese contingent was  quartered  near  Seoul for the Kings  protection.Japan afterwards  guarded her mission with  a large escort; but  in 1884, the  Kingsfather having returned, a fresh emeute, in wdiich  the troops of both  countries  took part, created a great tension  in the relations  between China  and  Japan.   To obviatefurther  risks Count  Ito went to  Tient-sin  in 1885, and made  an arrangement with
  Li Huhg-chaiig by which both&apos;sides withdrew their troops, advised the Xing of Korea  to maintain a sufficient force to maintain order, and each undertook to give the other  notice should it be found necessary to send troops again.  Chinese influence continued  predominant, though Japan  had made it abundantly clear  that she was in  no way  disposed to acquiesce in  this predominance.  The Ghino-Japanese War, 1894-5.      The Ito-Li modus vivendi was brought to the test in 1894.   In  the spring of that  year the Tonghak revolt  in South Korea became a  serious menace, and the Govern-  ment was  in  peril.  An appeal for help  was , made to  China,  and in July Chinese  troops were  sent  to Asan on the  south-west coast  of  Korea.  The notice required  under the Ito-Li Agreement was given in due course through the  Japanese Minister  at Peking, but. in  giving  this notice Korea  was  described  as  a state tributary  to China.      China&apos;s action was met by the prompt despatch of a  large Japanese force to Seoul,  and a protest against the claim of suzerainty.  Of this  protest  no notice was taken.  Then a proposal was made by Japan  that both countries should  combine  to restore  order, and to institute  reforms by means  of  a joint commission.   China declined  to  force reforms on the Koreans ; Japan retorted by undertaking the task herself.   Steps  were taken to strengthen the Chinese  forces at Asan, and to send  an  army from the  north - over the Yalu.   War  ensued; the  Chinese were  defeated ;  and  by the  Shimonoseki Treaty of the  17th April, 1895, China  recognised the independence  of  Korea,  and  ceded  Formosa, the Pescadores,  and  a  portion  of  South  Manchuria  (Kuantung) to Japan.   A  coalition of Russia, France, and Germany intervened, and  under pressure from them the Kuantung territory was retroceded to China by a Con-  vention of the 18th November, 1895.      The decline of  the Manchu Empire can  be  considered  to  have  begun with this  conflict  over Korea.  From the  effects  of  previous hostilities with the  European  Powers China had recovered  quickly, and her last embroglio with  France  in 1884-5  over Tonkin  had, if anything, enhanced her prestige ;  but  the ease with which she  had been vanquished by Japan in a short campaign of seven  months damaged her  position irretrievably.  Her real weakness  was revealed  to the  world, and  she began  to be treated as  a negligible quantity.   Germany seized Kiaochow;  Russia  exacted  Port Arthur and  Kuantung (the  territory retroceded  by Japan  in  1895) in 1898 ;  France obtained Kwangchowwan, and Great Britain Wei-hai  Wei and the Hong Kong  extension in the same year.  The Russo-Japanese War, 1904-5.      These  events  led up to the Boxer outbreak, in which Japan played a part of  studious moderation.  The action of Russia in Manchuria was, however, watched with  anxiety.   To guard against the Coalition experience  of 1895 the Anglo-Japanese  alliance of 1902 was concluded,  and when  Russian activities threatened to extend to  Korea  Japan took the matter up  at  St.  Petersburg.    She offered to recognise  the  special position of  Russia in Manchuria if Eussia would recognise that  of Japan in  Korea, and provided also  that  Russia would join with  Japan  in  an engagement to  recognise  the territorial integrity  of  China and  Korea, and to maintain  the &quot;open  door&quot;  in  .both countries.   Russia declined  to do any of these things, and by  her  encroachments in the Yalu region she brought the Korean question so prominently to  the front that Japan had either to back down publicly or go to war.      The Russo-Japanese war, fought almost  entirely on Chinese territory, was ended  by  the  Treaty  of Portsmouth  (5th  September,  1905) which  recognised  Japans  &quot;predominant political, military, and economic interests in Korea &quot; ; provided for the  simultaneous evacuation of Manchuria by the forces  of  both Powers ;  and transferredI  to Japan the Russian lease of Kuantung, together with  the Manchurian railway south1 of Kwanchengtze.   Manchuria,  except  Kuantung, was  to be restored &quot;entirely andI completely to the exclusive  administration of China,&quot; whose consent to the transfer ofI Kuantung was to be obtained;  and Japan and Russia &quot;engaged reciprocally not to1 obstruct any general measures  common to all nations which  China  might  take for  the  development  of  commerce  and  industry  in  Manchuria.&quot;  China&apos;s consent to  the transfers and assignments made by Eussia was obtained in a treaty between Japan  and  China, signed at Peking on the 22nd  December,  1905.   China&apos;s  own  position  in Manchuria was not greatly altered ; she had two Powers to deal with instead of one.         [1130]-424                                                    B 2
Engagements between Japan and  France, Russia and  America, for the maintenance of         the status quo in China.     In  two Conventions, signed  at Paris and St. Petersburg on the  10th June and the30th July, 1907, between Japan and France and Japan and Russia respectively, mutualengagements were entered into for the maintenance of the&apos; status quo  and support ofthe &quot; open door &quot; for commerce and industry in China.   By an exchange of  notes atWashington on the 30th November, 1908, the  United  States and  Japan  pledgedthemselves to the same policy.     The Chinese had come to look upon these diplomatic engagements between thirdPowers, ostensibly for their protection, with a critical  eye, and those mentioned above,coming  as they did in the midst of the &quot; rights-recovery &quot; agitations, were  speciallyobjected to as &quot; interferences with China&apos;s sovereign rights.&quot;Modern  Education in China : Influence of Japan.     After the Russo-Japanese War the reform movement  in China was ushered in bya radical change in the centuries-old system of public examinations.  This  led  to astrong demand  for Western education, which was  supplied largely by Japan.  Youngmen flocked there to learn, and students educated in Japan guided and moulded publicopinion  throughout provincial China.Manchuria : Settlement of Disputes between China and Japan, 1909.     Acute differences arose between China and  Japan over Manchurian affairs in 1909.They were composed for the time by two agreements (4th September, 1909)  in one ofwhich  the  vexed Chientao question  was  settled by making  the Tumen  river the boundary between China and Korea, and in the other  railway and mining questions in manchuria were arranged, though not to the satisfaction of the &quot; China for the Chinese&quot;party.Manchuria: The Russo-Japanese Convention, 1910.     On the 4th July, 1910, a Convention was concluded between Japan and Russia, inwhich,  after declaring their adherence  to  the principles of the  Convention of the30th July, 1907, the  two Powers agreed to work together  in Manchuria on  railwayquestions, and to maintain the  status  quo  in Manchuria  resulting from treaties  andother arrangements  concluded  up to date between  Japan and  Russia,  or  betweeneither of them and China.     The consensus of opinion in  China was that this Convention increased the grip of japan and Russia on Manchuria,  and that nothing short of force would ever dislodge it.And when, soon afterwards (22nd August, 1910),  the  treaty definitely annexing Koreato Japan was signed there had been a Japanese  Protectorate since 1905 the fate of korea was urged as a lesson to China in regard to Manchuria.Japan and the Chinese Revolution.     Throughout the changes of the Revolution of 1.911 and the attendant disorders theEuropean Powers and  America held aloof  and  maintained a general  policy ofnon-interference.  Japan alone let it  be clearly understood, as soon as the Manchudynasty was in danger, that she favoured  the  return of Manchu  rule.   She lost no opportunity of pressing that view upon Yuan Shih-k&apos;ai  and the Chinese Government, herreasons  being that  a purely democratic republic was unsuitable for China, and  that japan disliked the introduction so near her doors of a form of government BO different from her own.     The suspicions thus avowed were revived by the activity displayed by Japaneseduring the Yangtse  revolt in 1913 against Ytian Shih-k&apos;ai&apos;s Government.  Allegationswere made that they were deeply involved in the revolt, and were aiming  at the rapidextension of Japanese influence in South China.   A number of facts supported theseallegations.  A large body of South China students had been educated in Japan, wheresome of them  had  received their military training, and others had acquired  their political opinions, and they constituted a  strong  personal link  between the advancedsections of both countries.  Japanese officers served with the revolting party, evidentlynot without the knowledge of  the Japanese Government;  Japanese steamers carriedarms for the rebels ; the funds for the rebellion were remitted through Japanese banks;the chief rebels fled in Japanese ships;  and many others sought  asylum in Japan.
There were other Japanese activities, especially in the Yangtse provinces, and the sumof them, taken with the Japanese  attitude  at  the founding  of the republic, and theJapanese support of the 11)13 revolt, gave rise  to an increasing anti-Japanese feelingamongst the patriot advocates  of a strong and united China,, who  argued, rightly orwrongly, that Japan, to whom  they looked for  protection against  Western aggression,was in reality their most dangerous enemy.The Twenty-one Demands oj 1915.    Shortly after the  outbreak of the war Japan addressed an ultimatum to Germany(23rd August,  19.14) demanding the surrender&apos; of Kiaochow &quot;with a view  to  itseventual restoration Jjo^China.&quot; - The demand, being ignored, Kiaochow was invested, .and it capitulated on the 7th November.  Following this event Japan made a series of demands upon  China of a  far-reaching character (.18th January,  1.915).  In Shantungprovince she required China to agree beforehand to any disposition of the German rights,interests, and concessions in Shantung which Japan might conclude with Germany ;  inSouth  Manchuria,  an extension of the Kuantung lease and railway agreements;  in east  Mongolia, exclusive mining rights,  a  promise  that no  railways should be builtwithout Japan&apos;s consent, and the right to colonise ; in the Yang-tsze Valley, joint controlof great ironworks and new railway concessions; in Fukien, an  undertaking that nomines, railways or clock should be  conceded to foreign powers without  the consent of japan ; and generally, that no part of the coast should be yielded to a foreign Power.Other demands were that Japanese advisers, political, financial and military, should beaccepted ;   that the police should be  placed  under Japanese direction; that armsshould be purchased from Japan; and that Japanese priests should have  the right tocarry on religious  propaganda in China.     In the  whole of the curious history of modern China there was no parallel to suchan attack on the  principles to which the Powers, including  Japan, had repeatedlypledged themselves since the Boxer year  (1900) the integrity of China and equalopportunity to  all  nations.   The  demands now  famous  as &quot; The  Twenty-oneDemands &quot; caused a sensation in China.   But for the war they  could  not have been presented without  danger  of  complications elsewhere.  As  it was, Japan was givenhints by the Allies to restrain her demands within the bounds  of her obligations tothem, but she gave little heed  to these hints.  China whittled down or postponed a few of the terms, but  in  the end was presented with the familiar ultimatum (7th May),which was, as usual, accepted within the time  limit (9th May), and she signed a treaty with Japan and other documents recording  the transaction, on the  25th May.  The effect was to make Japan predominant in China  at the expense  of the  Western Powers, andto place the Chinese Government under  Japanese  influence in a manner which is certain to provoke dissension sooner or later.Japans Hostility to the Government of Yuan Shih-kai, 1912-16.     All through his presidency Yuan Shih-kai had to reckon with the covert hostilityof the  Japanese  Government, and when  he  endeavoured to  make  himself Emperortowards the end of 1915 this hostility became more and more pronounced.  The revolt in Yunnan and South China, which preceded his&quot;death (6th June, 1916), was started by a Japanese-educated officer, and it  was assisted by  Japanese  officers, arms and money. Russo-Japanese Treaty, 1916.     By a treaty of 3rd J^uly, 1916, Japan and Russia agreed that neither should be &quot; a party to any political arrangement or combination directed against&quot; either of them, and to &quot;take counsel  of each other as to the  measures to be taken in view of  the support or the help to be given in  order to safeguard or defend the territorial rights orthe special  interests in the Far East of one of the contracting parties recognised by the other contracting  party,&quot; should these be threatened. Civil War in China: Japan at First Supports the South,  1916-17.      Soon after the death of Yuan  Japanese pressure  for  the appointment of  military advisers, which had been dropped in 1915, was revived, and  a  Japanese general wras in effect appointed military adviser in September, 1916.  In the dissension and civil war between North and South, which arose in the 1916 revolt and which has continued
 up to the present time, there seems to be little doubt that Japan at first supported the Southern leaders.  It appears  also that General Tanaka, the head of  a  Japanese, military mission,  had some  communication with  Chang Hsun, the leader of the monarchical fiasco of  1.917, and it was naturally concluded that this episode was not a surprise to Japan.  Again, when the United States Minister at Peking addressed an innocuous note to the  Chinese Government (6th June,  1917) at the height of a political struggle between the Chinese Premier, Tuan Chi-jui, and the Chinese President, Li Yuan-hung, representing for the sake of peace that entry into the war was a secondary consideration  compared with the maintenance in China of a  stable Government, this step was greeted by Japan  with quite unnecessary irritation as  an interference in China&apos;s internal affairs. Ishii Mission to Washington,  1917.      The feelings created in J apan and America in connection with this American note of the 6th June, led to the mission of Viscount Ishii to Washington in August 1917, mainly for  the  purpose of securing an understanding  in regard to China.  Notes were exchanged  between Japan and America  on the  2nd November, in which the principle of the open door and  equal opportunity, and *the territorial integrity of  China, were enunciated once more, and the two Governments recognised that-      &quot; Territorial  propinquity  creates  special  relations  between  countries,   and          consequently the Government of  the United  States recognise that Japan has          special  interests in  China,  particularly in that part to which her possessions          are contiguous.&quot;      Japan, on the other hand, repeated assurances that she      &quot;Has  no desire  to discriminate against the trade of other nations or disregard          the  commercial  rights heretofore  created by China in treaties with, other          Powers.&quot;      The United  States  recognition of special  interests too  clearly recalled to the Chinese the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902, in which the special interests of Japan in Korea were  similarly emphasised, and the Peking  Government took the precaution to issue a  special declaration (8th November) that  China would observe her  treaty. relations with all friendly nations, as well as with those whose relations are special. because of  territorial contiguity, but  that she would &quot; not allow herself to be bound by . any engagement entered into by other nations.&quot; &quot;Arms Alliance,&quot; 1917.      While the Ishii   Mission  was  negotiating in   America, Japan  concluded  an arrangement  at Peking, spoken of  as the &quot; Arms Alliance &quot;  in  October  1917, which disclosed the fact that the Northern party, under  the  new President (Feng Kuo-chang had  succeeded Li Yuan-hung in August), had decided to enlist Japanese support to &quot;dish&quot; the South.  By this  arrangement a special loan of 3,000,0001. was granted by Japan, and a contract was  signed for the supply of  arms  under which the rights to nominate military advisers and to work an iron  region near  Nanking were  conceded. To  those who  construed this arms  alliance as taking sides  and  an interference in internal politics, Japan justified it on the ground that support was being  given to the deserving faction.  In foreign opinion its object was believed to be the unification of the armaments of  China and  Japan,  with a view to the eventual making of arms  for the Chinese army, the establishment of arsenals, and, in the &quot;end, complete  control of the military affairs of  China. Japan s Policy to Guide and Control  the North, 1917-18.      Following this transaction, over which a great outcry arose throughout  China, a number of  other loans designed to secure exclusive privileges or concessions, some of which are considered  to be infringements of the &quot;open door&quot; principle, were granted to the needy  Government and  politicians  of  the North during 1917-18;  and the general policy of Japan  since  it was concluded has  been to  guide  and control the Northern faction (while doing  nothing to actively oppose the South) and to increase the grip on China which was given to her by the engagements of May 1915.  Up to the armistice  (November 1918) little pains were taken by Japan  to consider foreign opinion in pursuing  this policy; but since  the  armistice it has  been  observed  that Japan has shown less open disregard of the views  and interests of her Allies and of China.o
