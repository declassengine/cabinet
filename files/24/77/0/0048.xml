IRELAND. &apos;     Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief &quot;Secretary1o                   Minuto of 17th March,  1917c      -  -l5^r%(j  y        &apos; j   weck endcd R6th Marcn,  i9i9*           .o following is a  brief  statement  on  tho  work  of  the  Depart-:sent  during tho  past  wook in furtherance  of  increased Pood  Productionin Ireland                  LOANS FOR  AGRICULTURAL  IMPLEMENTS *         The numbor of applications  received during tho  past  week  io79, and the total value of machinery ordered from the beginning ofthe presont year, to  date, under the Schome,  amounts to   13,392.                        TILLAGE SECTION.         The work of  tho Tillage Section  is,  at present,  concernedmainly with dealing with the reports  of  the Tillage Inspectors onholdings inspected early this year for the purpose  of ascertaining wether tho requirements of  the 1918 Tillage Orders wero corapliodwith.  A vory considerable numbor  of such reports are at present under consideration.         Much progress cannot,  however, bo made with tho ordinaryroutine operations of the Section  pending the settlement of thegeneral polioy to bo  adopted in regard to this  yoar&apos;s CompulsoryTillage- Schemo.PROGRESS OP FARM WORK.         Weather and soil conditions during tho earlier part of thewook were against progress in ploughing and sowing.   These operations.are, hewovor,  as well forward as could be expected in theoircumotance3, but little seeding hao been done, and all indicationspoint to a late  spring season.         Barley seed is reported to be in great demand in districts where this coroal is grownj  as it io thought likely to prove a betterpaying crop than cats or whoat.                   SUPPLY  OF ARTIFICIAL MANURES.         With the exception of basic slag, artificial manures, haveup to tho presont been obtainable in quantities ample for require^monts;         Complaints have been received from makers as to difficultyin affecting deliveries owing to the shortage of railway waggons.In a number of such cases the Department have been able tc give assistance towards securing improvement in the transit arrangements,2G/3/l9c
            Though a recent announcement of the Ministry of Pood statesthat the control of fertilisers will be removed  as from.the 1st June.next,  it is hoped that a voluntary arrangement will be made withmakers under which the various fertilisers will bo supplied at fixed prices for the coming season.                  CATTLE  FEEDING  STUFFS,             Notwithstanding the recent severity of the weather thereis ovory indication that tho supplied of feeding stuffs will enablefarmers tc carry their stocks  until grass becoraoo plentiful some weekshence.  Thero is, however, a daagor that within the next few monthsthere  will bo a shortage of linseed oake rooal, which will adversely affect the position as regards milk substitutes for oalf feedingpurposes.                       F  L  A  X.Flax Growing Operations,       Most of the land intended for flax hasnow boon ploughed, but sowing operations have not yot commenoed.  Alarge  number of farmers have dew-rotted, or aro dow-rotting, tho flaxstraw  off the portion cf tho crop which they reserved for coed pur-posoc.  The weather during Fobruary. and March has been favourable forthis operation.  &apos; Farmers have commenced  to purchase flaxseed on alimited scalo.Scutching.   No difficulty is  anticipated in getting most of the 1918flax o&quot;c.p. coutchod within the  season.  In a few districts the flaxscutching ooaoon has now endod.&apos;  In general, however, scutchingoperations will continue until May, and in a few distrioto, untilclose  on next scutching season.,Labour.    No disputes among flax mill workers have been reported totho Department for a considerable time,  Farrnors, however, are alarmedat tho demands made by various Unions, on behalf of farm labourers,for an inoroaso of Oofo in wageo and for shorter hours of work.Several resolutions have been received from representatives of farmers, calling on the Government to fix wages for flax work on aroducod scalo corresponding to a reduction in the price fixed for the1919,  as comparod with tho 1918 flax crop.                 MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK,           During the period from 18th to 24th inotant, inclusive,applications for licences woro received as follows           To slaughter or oxport heifers..............280           Te slaughter bulls or bullocks.............. 30           To oxport milch cows........................130           To  slaughter voal calves................ v.*  8,
