REIRE-ENTATION OF CIVIL SERVANTS BEFORE THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BOARD BY OUTSIDE TRADE UNIONS.

Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

With reference to G.T.6928, the terms of reference of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board for Government employees as settled by War Cabinet 252, Minute 6, prescribed the following method of procedure:-

"Any claim which may fall within the terms of reference shall be heard before the Board acting as a triplicate chairman, together with not more than three official representatives, and not more than three representatives of the class of employees concerned or their associations, where such association exists. Provided that in all cases the employees concerned shall be at liberty to nominate as one of their representatives a person who is not a member of the class in question. Such a person shall not, however, be a signatory to any agreement arrived at by conciliation."

The provision that outside Trade Union representatives should be admitted as spokesmen only, and should not be allowed to sign agreements, was a compromise adopted in pursuance of the practice of the Admiralty. It was intended to mark the distinction between Service Associations and outside Trade Unions, whose recognition as parties to claims by Government employees might involve the participation of Civil Servants in outside labour disputes. But the compromise has not proved successful. If the Civil Service is to be kept from any connexion with outside Trade Unions,/ membership 
membership of such Uniond by public employees should be prohibited; once the Union has secured any considerablenumber of employees, it is very difficult to deny it theright of representation, And when the ri;;ht of representa-tion is conceded, the provision that the representative should not be a party to an agreement,  so far from beingany safeguard to the State, only diminishes the security for the agreement.  In fact,  the representatives of out-side Trade Unions hare in several cases been allowed todign agreements in order to secure their observance.      In the opinion of the Treasury, it would have been preferable if recognition before the Board could have been confined strictly to public employees or the representa-tives -at Service Associations ( as is proposed in the case4f the 7hitley councils): but the present terms of referencealready admit other representatives and in the circumstances there is no advantage to be gained from refusing to recognisesuch representation fully.  Accordingly the Treasury would raise no objection to the deletionfvom the terms ofreference of the sentence      &quot;Such a,person shall not, however, be a signatory to any agreement arrived at by oonclliation.&quot;      It is understood that this-alteration would meetthe Vie-ro expressed by the Deputation of the Trade UnionCongress, which recently waited upon the Minister of Labour.                                   (initialled)  A.treasury, g.w.   9th April. 1919.
