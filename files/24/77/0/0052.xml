I am directed by the RoH.  Board to  say  that they have been authorised by the  Government  to communicate with  your  Council  with reference to the arrangements in  contemplation as to the work to be carried out in connection with roads and bridges in  Great  Britain  during  the  remainder  of  the current  financial year and  in  the next  financial year.      2.  The  Board have represented  to  the  Government that  the most useful kind of  road work  required  at  the  present  time is the strengthening,  reconstruction, and  resurfacing with improved materials of important  roads and bridges, and that the lengths  of roa*d to  be first  dealt with should be those on which there is,  or is  likely to be, .&amp; large  volume of heavy  motor traffic, keeping  in  view,  in the selection, all roads  carrying  considerable  traffic, whether  Main  roads  or  District  Roads,  which have  suffered  deterioration during the war.      3.  Owing  to lack  of road materials,  difficulties of transport, and shortage of labour,  it is known  that, during recent  years, the  ordinary renewal  programmes of Highway  Authorities have  not  been carried out  on  a  large mileage  of roads.  It is  evident,  therefore,  that the  work of deferred renewal  and maintenance will, in the immediate  future, throw upon Highway Authorities  a considerable amount  of additional expenditure,  and it  is also certain  that all work carried out next year will cost  more than  it would  have done at pre-war  prices.   Tn view of these  circumstances, the  Board have&apos; recom-  mended that some  special financial provision should  be made,  and the Government  have agreed  that,  having regard to the desirability  of stimulating employment on useful  work at the  present time, the expenditure of Highway Authorities in charge of the more  important  roads in  Great Britain on the  basis of their pre-war programmes of  renewal  and maintenance, enlarged as these  will necessarily be by the rise of prices, shall be  supplemented  by  Grants  in  aid  for additional  work  to  an  aggregate  amount  of   10,000,000, of which  1,750,000  will be provided out of the  Boad Improvement Fund  towards works of  improvement  and  8,250,000 will be  drawn  from the  National  Exchequer.      4. The  administration and distribution of the new Grants will rest with the Road  Board, subject to Treasury  approval, and  I am to ask  that  your  Council will  submit  proposals  to the Board at the earliest practicable date so that there may be no avoidable  delay in the final  arrangements for putting the work in hand.I    (22241)   P.1635/47.  3,500.  12/18.

                                         2     5. I  am  also to say that it appears to  the Board  that the  most expeditious  and  jconvenient course will be to follow the general lines of the procedure which they adopted  Iin connection with the proposed  classification of roads  in  1914,  a.nd that all proposals  jaffecting roads or bridges in any Administrative  County in England and Wales, outside london and outside County Boroughs, should be sent  in by  the County  Council,  on  jbehalf of  themselves in  regard to Main roads,  and  on behalf  of  all other maintaining  jAuthorities in regard to District Roads  maintained by Authorities other than the CountyCouncil.     6. It  will be competent for any  Non-County  Borough  Council, Urban  District  ::Council,  or Rural District Council to send proposals direct to  the Board, if they elect  jto do so,  but it is hoped that, in order to ensure local co-ordination,  they will comply  :with  the  request of  the  Board  that their proposals  should,  in  the first instance,  becommunicated to the County Authorities and then sent in to the  Board along  with the  1proposals  of the County  Councils.     7. No Highway Authority will be entitled to share in the new Grants for additional  Iwork unless  they submit a statement showing  that they are arranging to execute,  out  1of their own resources, at least as large a programme of road  work as they  carried out  1in the year ended 31st March, 1914, or,  in special cases, on the  average  of three years  1.ended 31st March, 1914,  having  due regard to the increase which  has  since taken placein the cost of executing road  work,  and  are  also  making the maximum  practicable  jprovision,  to deal with works of  deferred maintenance.     8. The selection of the roads and bridges  in each Administrative County on  the  jrepair, reconstruction, or improvement of which expenditure  is  to be undertaken  will  jbe settled  by the Board  in  consultation with the County Authorities and  such of the  !Other Highway Authorities as the Board may require to confer  with  in  regard to  any  ;proposals  put  forward,  but it  may be  stated  for the  general  guidance of highway authorities  that preference will  be given to  roads which have the  greatest  importance from the traffic point of view, or roads  which, having regard to their condition, urgentlyneed  repair or reconstruction to  avoid further deterioration.     9. The Board suggest that  it may  be desirable  in several Counties  to select for reconstruction  some  District Roads  which the  Authorities  concerned are desirous of  jhaving declared as Main Roads, but which it has hitherto been  impossible  to put  into  such  a condition  as would justify the County Surveyor in granting the certificate whichis necessary before they can be taken over by the County as Main Roads.     10. It is desirable that  bridges  on important roads,  especially those which have to  ;carry heavy motor  traffic,  should receive  consideration.  But it is  not expedient to appropriate any large proportion  of the  new Grants to bridge work, for  which the money  jcan be borrowed for a long  period of  years.  In order to  encourage Highway Authorities  jto deal with a reasonable  number of bridges, the Board propose  to consider proposals  Ifor Grants on the basis of not more than one-fourth of the cost  of reconstruction, leaving  Ithe Highway Authorities to borrow the remaining three-fourths.   It is hoped  that  this  fmay facilitate the reconstruction  of about 200 bridges in various parts of the  Country.     11. The Board fully appreciate  the difficulties with which  Highway Authorities  will  fhave  to contend  in  carrying out  the contemplated programme  of  work, and they  have  frequested the Government to release  as quickly as possible not  only  some plant  but  also  lpivotal men whose services will be essential  for  the execution of the programme.
    12. In view of the fact that road and bridge work offers useful employment in everylocality at a time when it may be most needed, the Board trust that Highway authorities will make  liberal financial  provision and  prepare  as full a  programme of work as itis  practicable to carry out next year, and will place at the  disposal of their engineers and Surveyors the necessary technical and clerical staff to enable the; preliminary workto be  done in as short a time  as possible.    13. As  regards roads in the County of  London  and in  County  Boroughs, applica-tions  should be made by Metropolitan Borough Councils and County Borough  Councilsrespectively,  and  the  Board  suggest that it  is very  desirable that the  metropolitan borough Councils  should  confer together  and  should also,  as  far as practicable  ornecessary, confer  with Highway Authorities in Greater London,  so as to  facilitate  theco-ordination of  the proposals generally which  affect Greater  London.    14. As  regards&apos;roads in Scotland, applications should be  made by County Councils,District Committees, or Burgh Councils (though the  amount available for the latter will necessarily be small) in accordance with the usual practice hitherto  followed in dealingwith Scottish Highway Authorities.    15. I am to add that the  new Grants will be in  addition  to those which were madeby the Board before the war, in respect of which work and expenditure were suspended.It will  be  open  to the Highway Authorities  concerned ip  these  cases  to resume  thesuspended works.    16. Forms of application  for the new  Grants are in course of settlement, but, until these  are issued, any Council jnay make  application  in  any  manner  that  it may find  most  convenient, provided  that all  necessary  particulars are  given which willenable comparison to be made of  the  road work as a whole proposed to be carried out inthe next financial year  with the road work carried out  in the year 1913-14.                                        I am,  Sir,Your obedient Servant,To the Clerk to the County Council,                                 orTo the Town Clerk,                orTo the Clerk to the District Council.Secretary.
