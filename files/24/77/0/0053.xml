     f0 H F T.-.........* *&quot; 7052,This Document is the Property of               WAR   CABIMflT,COURTS (EMERGENCY P0V.TRS)  ACTS and their relation to            Demobilised Soldiers0305             Memorandum by Sir Claud Schuster,1.       Tbe Courts (Emergency Powers) Act 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo,Vc    c,78) in effect provides that no one shall proceed to exe-    cution or otherwise enforce any judgment for the payment of    money due under a contract made before 4th August 1914    except with the leave of the Court,-         Similar provision is made as to the levying of distress,    foreclosure, realising securities, and forfeiting deposits.2,thatUpontimeanvoua such application, the Court, If of opinionht to be given to the debtor by reason of cir-cumstances attributable directly or indirectly to the war,may stay execution or defer the operation of any suchremedies for such time and subject to such conditions asthe Court things fit.     The Courts  (Emergency Powers)(Amendment) Act 1916(6 &amp; 7 Geo, V, c,.13) makes special provision for the caseof  &apos;offleers and men of His Majesty&apos;s Forces&quot; by extending the provisions of the Act of 1914 to money due under con-tracts made by them attime before t&apos;&apos;o passing of theAct (that is 17th Kay 1916), and by&apos;giving power to theCourt to exercise the discretion given under the Act of 1914,although the inability to pay is not due to clrcumsta?iceaattributable directly or indirectly to the war*     The Courts (Emergency Powers) Act 1917 (7 &amp; 8 Geo. V,c.25) further enlarges the Act of 1914 in favour of officersand men by making it applicable to sums due In pursuance of contracts made before the officer or man joined the Forces.     (It should also be noted thatclear that the Act of 1914 and itsto actions for tort,.)tho same Act makes itamendments do not apply the net result,., therefore, is that judgments cannot been forced against officers and mow insnoct of  contractsentered Into at any time before they entered the Forces with-out the leave of the Court, but that they only enjoy thisprotection so Ion;, as they remain in the Forces,   Uponagainst whomdemobilisation, therefore, an officer or manjudgment has been obtained immediately becomes liable to the remedies which were provisionally stayed by the Acts of .1916and 1917 if tho contract in pursuance of which the judgmentagainst him was obtained was made between 3rd August 1914 andthe date when he entered the Forces. -  Presumably he remainsentitled to protection given by the Act of 1914 in respectof any contract mado before the 4th August 1914,     It appears to be a matter for consideration whether theprotection which the officer or man has enjoyed during his military service should not be further continued at any ratefor a time equivalent to that for which It may be decidedto extend the Acts generally,,     The Act of 1917 contains a great number of other provisions which have no direct bearing upon this particular question andare, therefore, not alluded to in the.present memorandum.House of Lords., S0rM*   28th karch., 1919,
