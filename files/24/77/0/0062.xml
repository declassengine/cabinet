HUNGARIAN SITUATION.

G.T.7060

I think it right that my colleagues in the War Cabinet should see the following telegram which I have just received from Admiral Troubridge at Balgrade :-

"The Serbian Army is the only reliable Military force capable of rapidly dealing with Bolshevik     rapprochement of Russia and Hungary. They cannot act freely while their frontiers in the Adriatic,     Bulgaria, Roumania, Albania and the Dardanelles are threatened and they are everywhere subjected to     Italian ?triguo, Their requests for clothes and equipment necessary for Army and Navy are all refused which does not encourage them.  These considerations prevent us having this great striking force unreservedly at our disposal".

(signed) W.H. Long.

31st March 1919.
