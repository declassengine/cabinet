Armament Building, together with the adjoining oremlses ofthe Hotel ivietro pole, at present provides accommodation for theMinister of Munitions, the Deputy Minister, the Financialsecretary, the members of the Munitions Council the Secretariat,and the principal officers discharging the more central functionsof the Ministry.  rBhe staff housed in these premises numbers2,436,  It forms, therefore, the centre for the whole of- theMinistry1 s activities, and after careful enquiry it is perfectlydear that the Ministry of Munitions could not at present vacatethese premises.     An outline of the measures taken by the Ministry during thepast few months with regard to the release of premises willindicate the present position of the Ministry on the general question of accommodation.  On tho 11th November last the Head-quarters staff of the Mini^cry had reached a total cf 22,620*This figure has now been reduced by 8,072, of whom 2,541 havebeen transferred to the Ministry of Labour,  Included in theformer figure are about 1,400 Members of the Outdoor staff who were not provided with rooms in the London Offices.Concurrently with this demobilisation the Ministry has relinquished-quishod possession of the following buildings:-St. , ,rminr s Hotel.Victoria Hotel.17-19 Oocwspur street (3 Floors)-fit.- James&apos; park Temporary Building,Broad janctuary Chambers (part of).st.

The combined housing space of the premises alreadyreleased represents accommodation for about 6,300  pjrtons,and further arrangements have been made for the release in afew weeks time of the Constitutional  Club and additionalimportant business premises in Mingsway and elsewhere,representing accommodation for 1,850  persons-  By the middleof April 1919 or thereabouts the Ministry will haverelinquished accommodation providing  for 6300   1850  8,150 persons.     In view of tho circumstances in  which the Ministry founditself after the Armistice-, It is considered that the reduo-tion of staffs and release of premises shown above representssatisfactory progress in demobilisation.  It is to beremembered that whilst the Ministry&apos;s duty of supplying thetroops with munitions ended with the  fighting, new and heavytasks devolved upon it immediately after the Armistice.  Thefirst of these was that of the efficient and opcnomloliquidation of the immense financial  responsibilities and commitments of the Ministry.  Closely related with this wasthe work of assisting firms to turn over from Y/ar Industryto Peace Indus-cry since nothing would hamper the revival ofbusiness more than for. firms wishing  to start on new workto be held uo by being -unable to obtain decisions as to their financial position,. oho release of materials and plants ofall kinds; over which the Government had various claims.-
     A further additional function with which the Ministry hasbeen charged is the disposal of surplus stock and materials and stores of all kinds in every Theatre of V/ar,  and for everyGovernment Department,  The work of securing the best prices forthe Exchequer&apos;en the sale of these stores, without at the sametime disturbing the normal industries of the Country.and delay-ing their revival through placing masses of new or part wornsurplus properties on the market,constitutes one of the mostintricate business problems that has ever  been set.     If these important post-Armistice, duties are to bo discussed-oh&amp;rged with efficiency and.despatch,- the  Ministry will neoess-arily require the maintenance for some time of a comparativelylarge Staff.  It would clearly be foolish  from every point ofview to prolong the periods of Liquidation of Contracts or ofDisposal of stores by attempting to carry  out either of thesebig tasks with inadequate staffs.     The Government has also decided to develops the presentMinistry of Munitions&apos;into a Ministry of Supply charged withthe responsibility of providing, with a few exceptions, thewhole of the supplies for all the Departments of Government.      At the present moment the. Ministry has to carry on its work in over 90 buildings scattered all over London, and forthe most part wholly unsuited- for office purposes, and as adirect consequence., it is impossible to secure prompt and effective execution of the-work&quot;Which could be obtained if                                               imore suitable premises were available.,:&apos;     i1or some months past the Ministry of  Munitions have urged upon the Office of works the necessity for providingpremises in which it might be able to carry to an earlyfinish the winding up of its old business and the proper
development of Its new responsibilities,  The statement thatthe Board of Agriculture are being seriously hindered in important phases of their work through not being able to occupy Armament Buildings, whioh was originally intended for the Board, adds to the urgency of &amp; satisfactory solutionof the general problem of accommodation for GovernmentDepartments0     If suitable and centrally situated premises of the modern offioe type capable of housing 2,500 persons could beprovided for the ministry of Munitions, the following advantages could be secured:-     (a)  A speedier termination of the work of          Liquidation of Contracts and Disposal          of Jtores,                                    *     (b)  The organising and developing of the          Ministry of supply could be more effeo-          tively undortaken0     (c)  Armament Building could be placed at the          disposal, of the Board of Agriculture,     (d)  Hotel premises and.  Public Institutions,          (e,g0 Hotel Metropole., Grand Hotel,          national Gallery and Hertford House),          and important business premises, could          be vacated, thus saving the Government          the increasingly serious public criti-          criticism on the  retention of buildings          urgently needed by the travelling publio          and the industrial community..
