This  document is the property of His Britannic MajestyKfiovernment.4 4OFFICIAL HISTORIES.    I have now looked through the first instalment of the Official History ofthe Naval War which has been prepared by Sir Julian Corbett.    I do not in any way underrate the great care and literary skill with whichthis work has been conducted.  As  the  period covered is that for which I was responsible as First Lord, I feel bound, however, to  demur to its publication inits present isolated form.   In my  view the proper  form  of  an official historyis a full  and  fair  selection  of authentic  documents orders, minutes, telegrams and memoranda just as they were  written before the event.  If this is done, i see no objection to an official history, but an official history unaccompanied bythe documents would be  in my opinion misleading.  There is very little  of historic value that now need be concealed on public grounds and nothing on private grounds.    I think, therefore, that the Admiralty and the War Office should prepare aseries of the authentic  documents which actually were operative,  and, afterediting them as  far as  may be necessary in the public interest, should publishthem  with only  such comments as  are required to make the account fullyintelligible.  It will then be for the public at large and  for unofficial historiansto draw  their own conclusions and express  them at their discretion.   Let thepublic have  the facts, whatever they are.                                         WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL.  lSth April, 1919:(B19/182) 60 4/19 H&amp;S  7030wo
