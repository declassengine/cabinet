It was not in the mind ox the Committee of Home Affairs  to concentrate all meteorological work in the office  x-lais transferred.  They.thought it possible  that your Ministry mi,f.jlit desire tc make their own arrangements for such meto orologaoal wori as was necessary for tho purposes of your jtopUrtaoiit an-I for which pro- vision could not conveniently be  made by a central office,;  It was also  recognised that tho collection of observations in the Air for the purposes of your Military  as veil as for tho central meteorological service mast continue, to be made by the Air force *      But  the intention is that At  the  Moteo.tiog.ical Office is transferred in the manner proposed  the departmental meteorological services should be  very closely linied up with the central service  in the two folio-wing ways:-      (a)  the t.uj tc or logical Office  would bo under the control of an L:.ecutive Board responsible tc  the  Minister.  Departmental representatives would sit upon this Board; and      (b)  it is suggested that accommodation at the central office which would piobably be transferred to a place in the neigh- bourhoodof Whitehall,  could be set aside for Technical Officers of the departmental  services which Wuiud thus bo kept in intimate  touch with  the organisation ana current work of the central service;  they would also have  direct access to tho library and records which have been accumulated.p B Q 1\ iil&quot; TGoT.-7018

In view, however,  of the difficulties that the permanent maintenanoo of a small military meteorological section would present, the  ^rmy Council would be most grateful if the IJeteoro-legjoal Offioe  would undertake-.       [a) to  provide all the necessary personnel for the supply           of meteorological data for military purposes such as           calibration, construction of range tables, etc       (b) to supply the nucleus for a lieteorological section           in case of ..ar.

Regarding immediate requirements, it is considered that, as a temporary measure during the period of demobilisation. 5 expert meteorologist8 and IS technical assistants will suffice.      In the event of war, the Council consider that the nucleus maintained in peaoe should be capable of expansion to meet the needs of the  Field Armies as soon as their size has been determined 4,   I am to  ask that you will forward your views&apos; on this matter at an early date as possible.,                      I am, air,                              Your obedient servant,                                 (Sdi ) B.B.

I  am to request that the details  of the scheme  so far as   they affect the Admiralty may be  arranged with the Hydrographer   of the  Navy who is being instructed to keep Their Lordships*   informed in the matter.   3.   It  is  desired that in arranging these  details  it should   be made  clear that the work  of the  respective Government Depart-   mental  services should be confined  to  work  of an  immediately   practical nature as far as possible,, and that all research work   should  be referred to the Central Meteorological  Office for   detailed investigation..  This is  essential  to avoid  duplication.   4.

     The necessity of supplying accurate local meteorologicalinformation  for aviation purposes has produced a network,in the United kingdom and abroad, of meteorological stations for the Royal Air xtorce.  These are 30 in number as against7 of the Metoorologioal Office and aro station for station,as woll, or  bettor equip: od than the others.   This networkcannot be reduced for peace purposes to any 6ront e tentin the United kingdom as meteorologieal information muststill be supplied not only to the various aerodromes, sea-pi ne bases  and airship stations which are to be retained for military purposes but also, as civil and commercialaviation  rows, to safe uard the public and to moot therequirements of aerial commerce and engineeringsAbroad it will be necessary largely to develop the RoyalAir J&apos;orce service to provide what will beoomo in effect the meteorological lighthouses along the proat aerialroutes of the -British Empirci     A very  important part of tho Royal Air Vorco system which aust not be forgottcm is the methods of the dissemination of meteorologies! information, a highlyorganised system depending largely on the generaladministrative machinery of the Air i-&apos;&apos;orce ;nd one whichin the future will to a great ortent be carried out by wireless telegraphy, with Service apparatus and service personnel.     The supply of information, climatic investigation and research  &apos;or flyinb purposes can only be carried ,out bypersonnel who thoroughly understand and are intimatelyacquainted with tho climatic requirements of &quot;lying andsuch experience can only be gained by cloee contact with the people who do the flying.   The Royal Air  ores officertrained in Meteorology is clearly the only type who can beentrusted with this work as a Government Service.  Virilemoreover tho Royal Air uforoe is only concerned with that-;rt of Meteorology whioh affects flying, the information obtained by means of its network of stations with theirtrained personnel, by trie facilities for obtaining:vnper air data and by wireless and telephonic systems isthe same in.:. .motion as that required Tor the wide field of public interests served by the Meteorological Office.     The ,\ir Council accordingly submit that (l) there canbo no doubt  of the necessity cor the retention of a systemof meteorological stations under the control of the Airi-dnistry to  provide information for /lying purposes, and ( )that tho organisation for collecting and disseminatingmeteorological information required for othor t ..an aero-nautical purposes will essentially depend upon air-force personnel and equipment and that (3)  for these reasons it would bo  unsound for tho Meteorological Of &apos;ico to beresponsible  to any Department other than the? to  Ministry;

Dear sir Frank Heath,,           I find some difficulty in expressing myself about the     memorandum prepared by the Air Ministry for the consideration     of the Committee of the Cabinet on Home Affairs.  Per some     reason which I do not-understand I have no opportunity of     exchanging views upon meteorological matters with the Air     Ministry.  I have a good deal of experience of national and     international organisation which no one else possesses and I     am quite willing to place it- at the disposal of the Air Ministry     without any parti pris, in order that the country may secure     all the objects for whfch meteorological services are intended.     In the absence of the free exchange of views which seems to me     to be the best mode of procedure at this juncture I am obliged     to have regard to the word3 of the memorandum although I feel     sure they cannot represent the Air l/ministry!s real meaning.                        Meteorology which affects flying.          My first remark is on a clause in the 6th paragraph &quot;while     the Royal Air Force is only concerned with that part of metecro-     logy which affects flying.  No such separation&quot;^ meteorology     into parts is possible.&quot;  An important fact to bear in mind i3     that in the last sixty years a good deal of advantage has been     lost in consequence of a traditional tendency to treat the     meteorology of the sea sep:ri)itely from that of the land and that.     mistake  should not be repeated with regard to the air*  when     I first took charge of the Meteorological office I found that     there were several divisions of-meteorology into water-tight     compartments which had no dealings with each other and I attxi-     bute the success of the office in the development of the scier^d     in the last 20 years, which will easily bear comparison with     that of any corresponding institution in any part of the world,     to the fact that the divisions were induced to regard themselves     as co-operators not as competitors.The Secretary, Scientific and Industrua?; Research Department,      15, Great George Street, s.W. L         The Air Council fully recognise the number and importance    of navigational, agricultural and other non-aeronautical    interests for which under existing arrangements provision is    made by the Meteorological office-,  Itfheyaaseconfident  that in    meeting their own needs they can also provide for these other    needs and they would propose that it should be a condition of    the transfer of the Meteorological office,  to the Air  Ministry    that an Advisory Beard containing departmental representatives    of these various interests as well as independent experts    should be set up to advise the Air Ministry in meteorological    matters.  It should be added that in the scheme for the re-    organisation of the Air Ministry it is proposed that the  civil  .  department of civil aviation shall assume responsibility  for    meteorological services.&amp;ir Ministry,   - 12th February,  1919.
       The greatest  advance  of  recent years in  the .&quot;meteorology which affects  flying&quot;  came  from an  inquiry about ice at sea after  - the  loss of the  &quot;Titanic&quot;.   Recent  inquiries at the Office in the  interest of  flying require  reference  to the collection of observations from various  oceans made long before flying was a practical question.  We have ample  evidence in the office that the information which tre possessed  was  sufficient  to be i*f great service to airmen on the Western Front and else here.  On the other hand flying has  opened up  a number  of new problems in meteorology and  (pcntributed  a number of observations  but it has not yet shown the  way to any extension of meteorological laws or principles.  No doubt it will  -in time but  not  if its problems are treated as belonging to a separate compartment  of the science.      The distinction which  ought to be drawn and whi*h the memorandum does  not draw is that between  (l) the collection of ftbservaticms of  various kinds  on an  organised  plan for the purpose of supplying working meteorologists  of all kinds and all services with sufficient  data for their  work  and (2) the distribution to airmen,  seamen,  farmers, or the general public of information ooncerning the present state of the  atmosphere as oolleoted, examined,  charted and  summarised together with the inferences to be drawn from iti          Duplication which  is  admitted at present to exist.      This distinction  must  not  be overlooked when we consider what is loosely  referred to in  the memorandum  as &quot;duplication&apos;1. The  arrangements for the oollection  of observations should be so crganised that there is no  duplication. 1  All the Information by whomsoever it  is originally obtained should be collected for all The  meteorologists who have to  work  upon  it with the utmost promp- attitude by wire or wireless  or  post  according to its nature and purpose.      If there  is any duplication in that  sense it is without my knowledge.  It is possible  that some of the 30 stations of the Royal Air Force  might  supply the information now obtained from the Telegraphic Reporting  stations  of  the Office.  If that is the case then a proper  arrangement  should be  made  as with the Admiralty.Or Trinity House.      Meteorological Office has certainly not set up any observations or scheme  of collection in duplication of what already existed, and its.information of   every kind is always freely placed at the disposal  of every service that requires it without any reserve.   Duplication  of that kind or any withholding of information from the common stook is simply wickedness.  It would be entirely avoided  without  the subordination of all the services to one  ministry if the different services had acoommoda- tion in the same building.      But as regards (2) the dissemination of the information, the &quot; ttsition is quite different.  Duplication in that sense is of the essence of successful  organisation.  The  information must be duplicated for meteorologists,  for  the Navy, the Army, the Royal Air F$rce, for Merchant Shipping,  for Agriculture and for the general public.   All forms of  duplication should be canvassed by, if you will, a &quot;bureau of  informationw about the weather, and they should of course be adjuste-d to the requirements of the various users under the  supervision of officers or  officials fully con- versant with the speoial wants. This again is best provided for by having the officials of the various services using, the 3ame building but not necessarily all under one Ministry,
      And hero  it  mu,..t  be  remarked  that  the  v.ork  of the  Central Meteorological fcitaff is to  es^rosi.  the  inferences  from  the  collect- ed date  in  meteorological terms leaving the users  01  their  agents^o make  their  own translation  if they wish  into  a  form  which  can guide action,   It it  tho condition of.  tbo  atmosphere only  which meteorologists aim at  describing and anticipating.  To  offer  an opinion  as  to  whether  it  is good flying weather, or good weather for hay-making,, sr suitable for smalloruft, is beyond their duty. That  is  left and  must  bo  left  to, the technical experts  on the  spot conversant  with the special circumetances of the case?               Motoorology and  observations  of weather.      The  word  &quot;meteoralogy&quot; is also  loosely Uood.   Observations of  weather-conditions,  arc not  strictly  speaking meteorology. Almost overykady  requires and  makes  for his own purposes observa- tiona of  weather; engineers;, artillerymen,  seamen  and. airmen require  special observations of. wouthor for immediate use which oan be organised  for the purpose of  meteorology.    They are not in *themselves fflotoorolog^y but  only the  material for it.      On tho othor hand a  Central Office  where meteorology is pur-, sued  &amp;&amp;qb not  necessarily make any observations of  the  weather or  state  of the atmsophcreT&quot;&quot;*&quot;I&quot;t njsst make use of the  obsorts- tions of  other3c  and its  own form&apos; at&quot; best an unimportant addition^ It  is  the business to  consider what  observations are needed fo^the purposes  of meteorology; when  where  and  how the observations should be mado0   If the&apos;necessary observations are  already  made in  a  satisfactory manner  it is, of course, wasteful to  duplicate thenio     Meteorology  is essentially and unavoidably a  co-operative science,   She  consideration of what observations  are necessary for meteorological purposes;, when,  where and how they should be made  requires  the co-operation of the most  experienced  and  most capable meteorologists of &quot;all  countries6  Before the war the co-operation was  organised by  tho international conferences 1853. 1874p  1879 and 19050   Anothir conference which would have  dealt especially with the upper air  was arranged  for 19140  After the war the scheme  of co-operation&apos;, needs s-e organising,  by the same method of procedure and Q-J competent representatives  of the authorities concerned,,    In the international schemes  it is rooognised that each country needs  a few pioneer experimental establishments  in charge of meteorologists  of&apos;recognised eminence, for tho study  of  instruments,  methods and results,  with  tno  object of  advancing our  knowledge of  the atmosphere,  ouoli establishments are properlycqUs&amp; meteorological observatories.                    Observatories and stations.      These remarks arc necessary in  order that I may  deal with paragraph 4 of  the memorandum  which  refers  uo a network of  stations of  tho Royal Air  J&apos;oroo in the  United. Kingdom and  abroad for  supply- ing accurate l*cal information foi   aviation purposes, and says &quot;These are SO in number  as against 7  of tho Meteorological Office,* She 7  stations  of the  ....etoorologiaal Office which  contribute  observa-.. tions of  tho upper air are  its experimental observatories and  should bo  compared with  oxrorimental  stations  such as II.LI.d. Excellent, Hartlosham Heath  and Orfordnessand  not  with tho 30 observing stations  of tho hoyal Air ioroc.    Ho doubt during  the  war  those establishments  enjoyed advantages which were denied to  the observatories  of  the Meteorological  Office, as a civilian cstab- lishment, but  the circumstances of  the  war  were exceptional, aid should not be  regarded as normal or  permanent or as representingjthe considered efforts of British kotooxologists.   -During the war,  for  reasons  which are  sufficiently obvious, there  grew up a
9 -83 practioo of secretivciiass between departments.  lj-&apos;hore *vaa no recognition of common scientific ontcrorise to which all con- tribute! according to their ability.    There - as al-o a .n;ood dea of  &apos;poaching&quot; in respect of staff; on both thcoe counts the llotoorological Offioc as a civilian establishment with certain traditions of public duty was generally the sufferer.  Uich  practices&apos; should now be franily and simply dropped as incidents of the&quot;grim struggle of tho war which are really unsuitable to the organisation roquirod to provide what the Country needs in peace,  or for  that matter in &apos;war, if there had been opportunity to think the subjcot out.      If tin  suggested eomparision is not intentionally misleading it is difficult to avoid, the conclusion that the memorandum  is based on ignorwnc  of the principjo of meteorological prododure and practice.   Tho information necessary for aviation depends partly upon the general meteorological situation as disclosed by observations at- the surface,  and partly upon specific observations of winds to the upper air obtained by pilot balloons  :1th otaorva--tions of temperature not yet organised or even thought out.      The network of meteorological stations upon  hich the Meteorological Office depends for representing the general meteoro- logical situation as set out  in the Daily weather hcyort comprises 95 stations  which fellow a routine laid down bj international agreement to which this Country is a party;  62 of thorn are in foreign countries but all are on an agreed plan.    Of  the 33  in the British Isle 7 are tho  experimental observatories of  the Lleteoro- logical Office,  the others (with one  exception) arc at Coastguard stations,  light houses  or other establishments whore  tho necessary facilities  are  afforded,  and the  routine of observations is,  by agreement,  with the  several authorities,  unicr the control and super- vision  of the  kctoorological  Office.   If ^uch facilities wore  not available at a sufficient number of points it would be tho duty of tho  lieteorological Office to  sot. up the  necessary establishments but  so  long  as the facilities&apos;  exist  by  the co-operation of  the Admiral Commanding Coastguards and Reserve,  the Elder Brothran of Trinity House,  tho Board of Trade  and other authorities it  would be an obvious  extravagance  and waste  of  public funds  to  sot  up independently  establishments.      Before  the  war the  extensive network of land stations was supplemented by  wireless reports  from ship;,  and the JO etc  now in process of being  restored.      for the observations of  the  upper air tho Office lisees reports from its 7  observatories and  from stations of the   Meteorological Section E*E, in  Prance.   Through  the  courtesy of the  ,ur Jttnistry reports  are  also received from  a considerable number of the  30  stations  of the  Royal  Air  JForco at which observations  are made  in accordance  with  principles and practice  laid  down by the Uotoorological  Office which  supplied  the  instruments  and the instructions for  their use.    In  view of the  sorvi&amp;eS&apos; which the Office  has rendered in  these  respects it  is  not  quite  generous of tho  Memorandum  on tho part  of a ministry which during war time, is in the  enjoyment  of unlimited resources  of men and money to  make comparisons  of  the  final result with  the  equipment from&apos;which  the whole design proceeded.   The  7  observatories are  amply sufficient in number to onablo the   l&amp;toorlogical Offioe  to form an opinion of tho  work  of tho  various  instruments and methods and lead  up to necessary improvements.   As the ^ir Ministry  roquisros th6 30 stations for obtaining local  information  it  would again bo &amp;n  obvious waste of wublic  funds to set up other independent  stations to form a  sufficiently distributed network  for -the  KoteorologicaVl Office,   As a matter of fact  tho  distribution is  not  very sutt- ablo  and additional provision is  necessary in  some  localities which are very  important  from the  meteorological point  of view,   v but  aro  out  of tho way  of air. routes.
Co-operation.,     The&apos; suggestion that the multiplication of observing&quot;stations by one particular authority constitutes a claimto control the whole service cannot hold,   All the ships of tho Davy are observing stations with rules for  vobservations laid down by the Admiralty on the advice ofthe Meteorological Office and on the ground of numbersthe Admiralty would have a prior claim.   So long as theAir Ministry is willing to co-operate with the Meteorolo-psychological  Office there will be no difficulty in arranging an appropriate scheme of observations which will satisfy their requirements and  furnish material for meteorological study.To make absorption a condition of co-operation is of coursepossible but not advisable.     The application of the observations to the generalmeteorological problems of aerial navigation is a task of the highest difficulty which cannot be solved by anyprescribed routine,   I  now of nothing more perplexingthan a map of observations with pilot balloons,,  Suchproblems must depend for their solution upon unfetteredmeteorological study&quot;    The course to be pursued cannotbe prescribed beforehand/    The mere multiplication ofobservations will not help us,.   It is  ;to of thoseoccasions in which to do is far easier than to  now whatis ^ood to be done.   The leading idea must be discoveredbefore the path can be laid down.     The realities of the situation as I understand it maybe summarised as follows:-     1,A distinction should be drawn and kept in mindbetween the collection of observations for meteorologicalpurposes and the distribution of meteorological information for the immediate --se &quot;of any special claso- of personsrequiring information about the weather.     2.   The stations of tho Royal Air j&apos;orce are necessary-for the distribution of meteorological information toairmen.   For the personal discussion of the points raisedby airmen there should be a trained meteorelogin t on the spot.  They are therefore very suitable for observingstations complying with an agreed oode of rules.,     3.   The observations at those  .tstio.no made inaccordance with the agreed code of instructions in a manner similar to that icllowaci with regard to the groundobservations, can be utilised and ought to be utilised for meteorological purposes though  they are not in themselves meteorology.     4.    The trained msteorolcgjst on the spot shouldnot be encouraged to improvise meteorological theory.It should be part of his training (and not at all anunimportant part) to know where to stop in drawing-inferences from the facts before him.     5.   Meteorological study for the purpose of improving the inferences from the available facts should be organised
on a comprehensive &quot;basis without any separation, into oompart-dents such as.sea meteorology or land meteorology or airmeteorology, hut with the co-operation so far as necessary ofthe meteorologists at the observing stations * -     6. All the available information of every kind about the atmosphere by whomsoever obtained and whatever the controllingauthority may be, chould be collected in an organised manner anddistributed in some compendious form so that all those who require the information, whether for their own immediate use orfor the purpose of study, should be able to have it or obtainfree access to it.     7. whatever the controlling authority of the MeteorologicalService may be there must be a number of experimental establish-ment&apos;. corresponding with what are at present the seven observa-tories: of the Meteorological office, where meteorological work inunditaken for the express purpose of the advancement of meteorolo-psychological  science without reference to any particular service,  the equipment ahould be as ample as possible.  They should take their part in contributing routine observations not as their chiefobject but merely for the purpose of keeping in practical touchwith the general scheme the ground of their claim to public funds should be research^ not immediate utility or the nece-&apos;.-si-ties of any particular serviceo     8. in like manner the Central Meteorological Office should provide staff and facilities for researches of a general dynamicalor -statistical character as distinguished fpom the experimentalcharacter of the work of the observatories.  The came office should be utilised for the collection of information and its immediate distribution but the distribution of ourrent informa-tion should be only one  side of its activity hot its sole or evenits chief purpose,             -              v                              Yours truly,                              (Sgd,)  ITAPIEil SIOTt
