  THIS_DCCUMEIlT JS^TO JRO^EOT OF HIS  BRITAIN IC HA JESTY &apos;S  GOVERNMENT)*ft SECRET. G I T- 7020          *         AIR  ^jy^yv^ ESTTHA.TES.            Memorandum  by the  Chancellor  of  the Exchequero            I regret  that it should be  necessary to  call  tho  attention of the war Cabinet to  a grave broach of  well established financial  $ procedure e             I learned  on ray return from   Paris that  the Air- Ministry- Estimates for- Vote A and the  Vote on Account were forwarded  to  the Treasury  by an  official letter dated 10bh March (but  not  received till the  12th)o   In  this letter  it was stated that  copies  are &quot;this &apos;day&quot; (icGu 10th March) being  laid on tho Table of the House  of  Commons &quot;            An  explanatory letter dated the  7th March but received  in  the Treasury  late  on Saturday 8th March  was also forwarded by  the Air  Ministry*   Tho letter explained that the Council are of  opinion  that the Peace Establishment of the ROAWPJ  should consist of  102 Squadrons, mwita necessary complements&quot;of Headquarters.  depots,  and other  formations:  that  3-000-000 was included In tho total  estimate for experiment, development&apos; and Civil Aviation, and  contained  other  particulars as to the content of tho 66-1 million  vrhich appears  on the  Vote on Account as tho Air total for the year.  it  is quite  irregular that an estimate should be laid bofore-  Parliament until the  formal assent of tho Treasury or at least  the personal concurrence of the Chancellor  of the Exchequer  his been given-.-   I do not propose now to comment upon tho  character  of these particular * estimates*.:  I will merely observe  that  tho tw  o  questionsjboth of which wore of sufficient importance  to  require a Cabinet  decision, viz- the size of the&apos;past-war Air  Force,  and tho extent of Government assistance to Civil Aviationlfj1 &quot;ere  prejudged by the Air Ministry without  consultations
      I have to request that the Cabinet will formally record that o     (1)  no estimates are to be presented- to tho House without previous submission to arid approval by the Treasury,-.     (2)  that large questions of policy in  connection with  the            ( A vi gjjg Civil yWaval     Military /Services arc- to be submitted  for Cabinet     &apos;            idecision or approvalt       This is the practice uniformly followed by the admiralty and VJar Office, but the failure, from whatever causes, of  theAii? Ministry to observe it makes it necessary that explicitdirections should be given by the Cabinet.                                             A*CU                                                 21/5/19 a
