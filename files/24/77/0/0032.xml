First Cormiasioner of Torino with reference                         ;to&apos;&quot;0&quot;T.&quot;&quot; 699^-        I approve generally the proposals in this Bill, butthere arc one. or two points which appear to ir/&apos; to r quirofurther consideration as possible  amendments to the Bill,        Clause 4-.  ITo account is taken in defining th-- t rr*for-igji valu*:-! of the question of the rate of exchange of thoexporting country.   In view of the fact ,that probably for a con-siderable time rates of exchange will be very much disturbed, andthe German rate of exchange will in /particular be probably very low in regard to this country, unless some provision  is mode to counteract this, it will be possible for Germany to dump a large amount of goods into this country and s&amp;riously affect Britishindustry-without contravening the provision of the Bill as draftedI would sug3c.pt that words be add fid. to Clause 4 to safeguard against this danger.  *        A further point arises in Clause 8, Sub-section b* Firstly1 would point  out that  in the Dominion cf  Canada, Anti-Dumpinglegislation operates ae much against Great Britain as against otheiotuntries.  I  do not .know whether any  of the  other Dominions havesimilar legislation, but this can bo ascertained.  It  surely wouldbe only reasonable to ask why this Act does not apply to  thedominions, and whether  we -can obtain reciprocity for  British goods from the. Dominions.  .Thie &quot;rould probably net  bo difficult.        The word  rconsign1 in this Sub-section, line  36,  page 5\do-^s not appear  clear.  If it relates to goods made or produced in any of Hie Majesty1s f^ominions7 it would be unobjectionable,but if it can  be held to include, as would appear at  first, reading the goods consigned, which might have  origin  In foreign countries,it would enable the United States manufacturer, by w  ans  ofconsigning through Canada., to  &apos;ya&quot;de the purpose of - th-*  Bill.^JOCmm 13 THE PROPERTY 07 HIS HUgANTO] I^gjSg S government^RH^ITT,)3 C RE T,
It is not clear to me why the word .&apos;consign&apos; is necessary inthe Clause at alii             Clause 1, Sub-Section a, lines 7 and Oj  Theword Systematically&apos; seems, a very vague word to introduce into an Act and might easily lead .to grave difficulty inpractice and interpretation.   It 1 ould imply a long continuedprocess of importation at lor; prices and in the intervening period the Board of Trade would be powerless to act while much damage might be done to trade,   .Tbe dumping of large quantitiesof goods at such widespread values, which make it difficultto recognise whether it was systematic or not, would producegreat unsettlement of markets and loss of confidence in domesticmanufacture,   I-would suggest that Substantial quantities 5  initself is quite sufficient ground for the Eoard of Trade to actupon/ especially as Sub-Section b, is in itself a safeguard against powers being used unnecessarily.   The wordSystematically&apos; could therefore be omitted.             Clause 5 appears obscure.   As I und.ersta3.1d,its effect, if an American steel bar manufacturer sendssteel bars to South &quot;&quot;&quot;ales and uses these for the manufactureof tin plates, which are Sold in the United Kingdom at a lower price than the value of tin plates in the country where the steel bars come from, the Act will be an-oliedto the goods so imported.   I would like to know whetherthis is a correct interpretation.                              (Signed)  Alfred Lend.24th Aarch, 1919.
