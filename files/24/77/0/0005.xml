Lambert (by private notice) asked if the        President &quot;of the Boas?, of Agriculture  is able yet to        say whether the prices paid to farmers for controlled        cereals ^ryeDi^cji  in  1919  will be not lens than        those  now &quot;current        The President  of the  Board of Agriculture  (Mr.        Protkero)&quot;Yes  Sir, the answer is  in the        affirmative,&quot;        In  reply  to a request  from  tho Board of Agriculture for  Scotland  for fuller  definition of the position oreatei by the  announcement  referred to, the  following  telegrams w*re gent  and recoivd and wero  published  in th^  Scottish prse.        Board  of  Agriculture &amp; Fisheries  to  Board of        Agriculture  for Scoeland         &quot;Prices  to  be  fixed for next  year&apos;s controlled&apos;          cereals will  not  be less  than those current;&apos;  in          other words a. minimun, is  guaraiToeed.&quot;        Board of  &quot;Agriculture for Scotland to Board cf        Agriculture  &amp; Fisheries:-         &quot;Wire received.   Bo6s statement  mean that maximum          prices  for controlled o^r^-vls now current will V          gu:.rant^ftd minimum private cos for next year,!J crepe?&quot;        Board of  Agriculture &amp; Fisheries to Board cf        Agriculture  for Scotland:-         &quot; ^ou* interpretation of - s tat ernerit  a3 to cereal          prices  for next &quot;year &quot;is&quot;&apos;&quot;cbTr*e&quot;o&quot;B.71 &quot;      .      &apos;           suggestion was made that only a part  of the crop would be paid for,  nor is any distinction drawn between one cereal and another.        In my judgment  a definite pledge was given by the- Government to ensure to  the fairer tho maximum prices of  the 1918 cere-.!?? for crops grown and harvested in 1919.        There can be no doubt that the farmers of the United Kingdom have so  interpreted the pledge.  i&quot;o public statement has been made to modify it.  On the strength of the promis
m -if.; mwL,  farmers have maintained or increased t:&quot;eir cultivation, and the W    Board of Agriculture for Scotland have issued corpulsory orders    for increased cereal cultivation.          In these circumstances any failure to fulfil the pledge    would have the worst possible effect upon the future of agriculture,    upon the Influence of the Departments concerned, and upon the    authority of the Ministers at their head.         It has been suggested that payment in full should be made    for the wheat crop, for four-fifths of the barley crop, and for    two-fifths or one^half of the Oat&apos;crop.   The pledge given would    not be redeemed, if this course were adopted.  Moreover, the re-    lative position of Scotland (and I believe also of Ireland) would    be quite intolerable, as the following figures will show:-                                TABLE IoEngland &amp; Wales,ScotlandWheatacres2,556,661   79,059Barleyac&quot;re&quot;s1,500,809  152,847OatsAcres2,780,0611,243,816Total.CerealsAcresj6,837,5311,475,722                     ENGLAND.

England would receive c. premium on 71$ or 75/ of hor cerealacreage and Scotland on 47&apos;  or 56,  of hor cereal acreageaccording as oats arc paid for at  tho rate of 2/5 or J-.This differential treatment of the two countries of 19;  to24$ is indefensible.          Further,, though more oats are grown In-Englandthan in Scotland; the proportion of oats grown to wheat inthe two countries is such that the r-nglisli farmer would oc-tain the smallest premium  (one half)  on 40;   only of hiscrops j while the Scottish farmer would obtain the smallestpremium, on 34;  of his crops,.          In order to place Scotland  on the  same footing  asrngalnd and &quot;ales in respect  of premiums paid for production-all over, it would bo necessary, if rn arbitrary figure ischosen, to pay on two-thirds  of Scottish oats and on  one-third  only of T&apos;nglish oatg,          I merely draw  attention  to  the inequality whichwould  result from the suggested discrimination.   I repeatthat nothing but fulfilment  of  the pledge will  prevent  acomplete  loss of confidence  in  the Government,  and  disasterto  the future of agricultural policy          I  agree with  the suggestion of the President  of.&apos;the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, that  in any event alloats  on Government  account should  be  purchased in theUnited Kingdom  in  1919-1920t                              (SgdO  Robert  LunrOoScottish Office,    &quot;&quot;hitehall,  SV  1,
