The  offers received direct by the Board in response to the President&apos;s appeal to  landowners for landI; suitable for small holdings now number 120, comprising  approximately; 18,500 acres.   Of these, 40 offers, representing 1,800 acres, have i been declined as unsuitable.      parm Settlements administered by the Board.  Eighty-seven ex-\ service men are now employed on the Farm Settlements and 16 menJ belonging te Agricultural Companies.           During the week the facilities  for the disposal of\ potatoes from the Kclbeach Settlement have very greatly improved. An average of ten tons is now being dispatched  each  day.   Thej planting of the demonstration fruit pl*t  is now in progress.           In spite ef the recent bad weather the winter corn at Heath Hill ljoks well and has a good colour.   The condition of the] stock on the farm is good.           Pembrey.   A fine week with a strong  wind  has greatly driedi the land.  &quot;Ploughing is being pushed on, and it is  hoped that it\ will be possible to *get in1 about 90 acres of  oats.   It isI suggested that about 8 acreo be put under potatoes and  12-15 acresl under mangolds.   It will be necessary to fallow over 100 acres inI order to clean the land, which is in a very dirty condition.           &apos;7here the dykes have been cleaned out the  land drains are running well and the fields are drying up.   A  very  large amount tf work on drainage still, however, requires to be carried out.           Bosbury Trust.   On &amp;arch 25th possession  was secured by the Board of 4 0 acres &quot;cf this Settlement.   A small holder on the estate is being allowed t* remain as tenant, the remainder sf the land will be in hand.   Live and dead farming stock on  one of the\ farms has been taken over at a valuation.           Though the land is very wet after the recent  bad weather, all work is well forward and winter wheat and beans  look well.
                (ii)  Work of.Agricultural 13.xecutrlv,Cpmitt&amp;ep .            Towards the  end  of last year, the Board  transmitted to the  War Office representations recoivsd  from the Agricultural Executive  Committees for the  Eastern and  Southeastern counties  pointing out  the urgent need for restoring land that&apos; had been  used  by the Military  Authorities for digging trenches  and other similar  purposes.   The  !7ar Office have now replJLM  admitting their obligations; but stating  that they are  not able ts  carry them Out owing  to the  difficulties  of housing, billetting, and subsistence.   In view of the shortage of  labour for farm work this  decision of the War Offioe will cause ccn-  siderable hardship  to  the  owners  of  the lands affected, and the Board  have,  therefore,  sent  a strong  protest to the War Offioe and urged  that the question be reconsidered.       Determination  of  Tenancies.   The total number of Orders issued  since the date when occupiers were given the right  under the Corn-  Production (Amendment) Act,  1918, to require a  reference tfl  arbitration is 111.   The  number  Of  cases in which  the result cf  arbitration proceedings has  been  reported to the  B&amp;ard is only Q, and  in all 8 cases the  arbitrator upheld the Order.            During the week  twa Orders have bean  made determining  tenancies on account of bad  farming  in respect  of 120  acres;  in both  these cases the farms  (which are  situate in Carnarvonshire) were  virtually derelict  and the question  of determining  the tenancies had  baen for some  time  under the consideration of the Executive  Committee.                      (iii)  Provision of Allotments.            Information  haB  been  received that 4  Local Authorities  are acquiring  under the Cultivation  of Lands Order  altogether 7-J  a?res of land  which will provide  109 allotments.    Under the Small  Holdings and Allotments Act  3 Local  Authorities have undertaken to  acquire  9 acres out of which 660 allotments will be provided.   4  appeals against notices tc quit have been dealt with recently and. in  each case a continuance $f the  tenancies has been arranged;  170  holders were affected  and  the total  amount of land  in  question was  13-J acres.                           (iv)  Land,Drainage.            A letter  has been  addressed to Agricultural  Executive  Committees by  the Board informing them that it  is net  thcught  necessary or advisable that  a separate ste-ff and  office  accommodation  should be provided  for the Drainage Committees which  have been and  will  be  constituted but that they should work  in olsse  co-operation with the  Executive Committees.   The Board haro t&amp;ld  the Committees however that  they  would be prepared  to  consider any  application for the appointment cf a Drainage  Surveyor tc advise the  Drainage Committee  and to  act as  the special officer of that  Committee but  that  any Drainage Surveyor  sc appointed  would work  under the general supervision of  the Chief Executive Officer although)  he would report cn  all drainage matters  direct  tc the  Drainage  Committee.                         Horticultural  Division.Fruit Section.                                                                      I       I$PrT!s.from HpK^nd.

f  were read from various  interested Associations urging the  advisability of maintaining  the restriction of plants and &quot;bulbs from  Holland.    It was  agreed that the resolutions after modification  should  be accepted, and that the Bo^rd  should be advised to reply  accordingly to the Board of  Trade.           The question  of  the restriction on the importation of  baskets from Holland was also considered and after discussion it was  agreed  to advise the Board to.recommend to the Board of Trade that, aw  the output  of baskets from homo sources would be insufficient for this  year5 s  crops, licences  to  import fruit  baskets to the extent of one  million in  the first instance should be granted.      ii^JL^A^lLX^iXlSt.*    ^lie Demonstration Fruit Plot at Holbeach  Crown settlement has been  visited and it was found that the work was  proceeding  very  satisfactorily.   5 acres of the 10-acre plot has  already been planted.   A  5 ^acre plot has also been laid out, and the  pruning of.  all the trees is  to be proceeded with after the planting  is  completed.      Bep-35eQQir.fi*   A series of six lectures on bee-keeping arranged  by  the  Dorsetshire Horticultural Sub-Committee has been given during  the week by the  Board&apos;s Technical Expert in different parts of  the  oounty  .

The  soil is  rich and si  much as  200 per annum  net profit is made  from a  5-aere holding .   The  great  need  in this district  is light railways.      ffist Suffolk.   The owner  of a  10-acre  fruit  holding was visited,  and it  wao  found &quot;that great  damage  was  being done  to  the trees  by  bad farming.   A demonsoration was  given and the  owner  advised  as  to  spraying,  inter-cropping  and vegetable  growing  for  market.   He was  very grateful  for  being put  on  the  right  lines.      Yorkshire.    Reports  have  now been obtained  by the  Horticultural  Sub-Committee  of all  neglected  orchards in the  county ;  and  the  assistance  of the  Board-s  Technical Inspector  has been  sought  to  enable  them to be  properly cultivated.

At Corwen, with a population cf 1,500,  in the heart of a rural district, about SO)&quot;  of the householders had no land forcultivating,                           Technical Division.     Rep01ts on Farms taken ever by Executive Committees .   under regulation&quot;^-; of the Defence :t thi Realm Regulations Agricultural^xecutiT/O 0&apos;o.rmit tees in Snglcid orj 7rles have &quot;-taken possession ofabout 64,000 acres of tadJy tr,:aczi land-.   In a number of cases thisland has been let to suitable tenants for the maximum periodpermitted by the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition cf Land) Act, 1916;but the larger part - about 38,000 acres in all - lias been fc.pt inhand and farmed by the Executive Committie,  either und* r the super-vision of a mfmb.r cf the Committee or of one of its District
Committees, or un&amp;or the management of a paid farm bailiff.   Duringthe past year, officers attached to the technical Division of thePood Production Department have inspected a number of the farms beingmanaged by the Committees, and their reports generally afford strikingevidence of the beneficial results of the Committee&apos;s action,   a selection from these reports has been made for publication in the  formcf a leaflet.     The Use of Explosives for clearing, purposes.   Arrangements havebeen made for some experiments on land in Essex,  with a view totesting the efficacy of explosives in removing tree stumps.   the experiments, which are being undertaken by the Edmonton MunitionsCompany, Limited, are to be watched by the authorities of the EastAnglian Institute of Agriculture, Chelmsford,   It may be possible atthe same time to make some observations on the use of explosives forthe purpose of breaking up a hard &quot;pan&quot;.     Seed Testing Station.   During the month of March 3,750 sampleswere received, which is as many as during February,   Oats and barleyare still being received in large numbers:  many of the samples arein poor condition, germinating no more than 20 to 50 per cent,   623sampZes of clovers have been tested during the month.   The  Englishclovers are, in the main, of poor quality, but some excellentsamples have been tested.                           Labour Division.     graining of ex-service Men.   Hutting has new been obtained fromthe Military Authorities and the establishment of several additionalCentres where ex-service men can be trained in agricultural  w*rk isbeing prooeeded with.   The number of nen under training at  theCentre already established at Brentwoed, Essex, is now 67,     Demobilisation.  The number of agriculturists demobilised  duringthe seven days ended the 26th March was 11,057,  bringing  the  totalnumber of such men released to that date up to 177,365.    This  numberrelates t&amp; the whole of the British Isles, a separate  figure  for england and \7ales not being available.     Soldier Labour,   A further 2,S73 soldiers of AgriculturalCompanies were demobilised during the week, reducing the  strength ofthese Companies to 25,122 men, that is, a reduction of 46,929 sincethe date of the Araaistice.          The remaining soldiers on the land are eligible fcr retentionfor the Amies of Occupation under Army Order 55 of 1919  and  theMilitary Authorities have issued instructions that they are to  borecalled to military duty.   9,000 of the men are attached to theAgricultural Companies and these will be withdrawn from the land  in  a fortnight&apos;B time and sent to rejoin their units.   The remaining  men,who belong to the Labour Corps, will be recalled as they  are  required.This decision involves the disbandment cf the whale of theAgricultural Companies and in a few weeks1 time soldiers  will nolonger be employed on farm work.    The withdrawal of  the men at  oneof the busiest seasons of the year when all farm work  is  alreadyse^ously behindhand will cause very serious dislocation.  All themen are skilled and therefore cannot be replaced.   They  havo been on civil work for periods varying from five months to nearly three yearsand many of them are the only skilled men remaining on the farms  onwhi ch t hey are employe d.                              &quot;Tamers Branch.          The demand for women-workers is growing again;   last  week  itwas impossible to fill the vacancies for horse women and  milkers.No figures are available for the approximate amount of labour that
will bo required during the coming season,  but the reports fromthe County Secretaries in the T7est Midlands show that  a largely increased demand is expected.          In reply to the circular issued to the Land  Army,  9,603answers have now been received.   Of these, 6,043 say  that they wishto stay on in agriculture after the war;   3.560 propose taking upother work.          There is a general fee3.ing among the women of the Land Armythat an Association of Land Workers should be formed to carry on whenas a Government Land Army they are demobilised.  From Sussex has comea scheme of the kind, formulated by the women themselves,  layingspecial stress on such points as tho need&apos;for a hostel to  accommodatea dozen to fifteen L.A.A.S. to be  used partly for permanent boardersworking on neighbouring farms, and partly for Association  membersresting or out of work;  the&apos;retention cf officers on present land army lines;  a Thrift Club and uniform.          It is now understood by  the Women&apos;s Branch that  recruitingfor the Land Array should cease on October 51st, 1919,    No definite decision as to the date for demobilisation has yet been made,          Messrs. Dennis and Sons. Kirtcn.  Holland, who are takingpossession of the Nocton Hall Estate on April 6th, have applied forten tractor workers for pexmanent  employment.   The women  will receive the full rate of wages;,  the estate will be run on a profit-sharing system, in which the women will be included-   They will alsoh T&apos;-e an opportunity of investing their profits in the estate.   Farmwork will &quot;oe required as well as tractor  driving, and this woulde^-orn an excellent chance of securing a good opening for women who wish, to take up farming as a career, but  have not sufficient capital to 3tart on their own account^     ^L-SSIiliL IllR^ tu%?.9 &apos;   Pr ogre ss cont inues.   During the week 13new Instituxes have&quot; been started,  making a total cf 960.          A successful School of Instruction v/as held at Lichfieldlast week:   Twelve students, whoso qualifications as voluntaryorganisers will subsequently be considered, attended, and  receivedinstruction in such subjects as the History ana Development of theMovement, the Formation, Consolidation and Carrying on ofInstitutes  men&apos;s Institutes and HandicraftsPoultry-keeping forWomen, and Home-making as a Factor in Empire Building.          The National Federation are compiling a panel of speakersto be available for the County Federations and other oentres.   the speakers inchided will be competent to deal with  such subjects asBee-keeping, Gardening,Rural Housing and. - Health questionsr   Theneed for obtaining suitable halls is being gradually met,  and at great Btukeley (Huntingdon), where a V/omen-c Institute has been inexistence for one yoar only, an Institute Hall has already been built,                           Culti^ati on Pivision.     ^lacASi-JI^ki  During the week ended 14th March 2.740 acreswere p:o&quot;u*g*hed, 31 acres were cross-ploughed and 131 acres werecultivated.

     Liquidation of Tractor Scheme.  The proposals of forty-oneAgricultural Executive Committee a&quot;have now heen approved.    Out  of atotal of 2,940 tractors in the counties concerned 840 (or  approximately30/0 are to he retained until the end of September.   These  figures   !include 15 counties, the Committees of which ars eatisfiftd that farmers will not need the assistance of Government tractors  after  theend of May and where the tractors will he disposed of after  that date.     JSaJLegc   During the week ended 29th March, sales were held  in the counties&quot; of-Bedford, Staffordshire, Yorks (H.R.), ITprthanta. Kent,Pembroke,  Hertford, Devon and Bucks.   Reports show&apos; that good  pricesstill obtain.   The best results so far were from a sale which tookplace at Halton (H,R.) where 17 Titan tractors fetched an  average  of 186. 16.  5. (top price  225) and 7 Pordson tractors with  Oliverploughs an average of  223. 11. 5.  (top price  255).          Binders continue to top  40 and carts and lorries  stillfetch their cost or over.   Prices obtained for implements such  asploughs and cultivators are ragged, and in many cases thoseimplements most favoured by Committees fail to realise as  much asthose types v/hich Committees were not anxious to use.          Up to the 29th March, returns from auctioneers show  thatthe following tractors and tractor implements have been disposed of:-                                       340 tractors                                       407 tractor ploughs                                       246 miscellaneous tractor                                            implements                                        89 binders                                      1,653 horse ploughs                                       444 carts and lorries                                       279 drills                                     1,239 harrows and cultivators                                       672 rollers and presses          Up to date 161 sales have been held for which 136  returns are to hand.   46 sales have been arranged to take plaoe during  thenext two or three weeks.     fforse Sales.   Only a few horse sales took place last week.   Thetotal number of horses disposed of.up to date is just over 4,000,  andthe average price is well maintained at over  60.          Arrangements are being made in several counties  to take  oversome of the Board&apos;s horses.   These animals will be added  to thestock of the farms which the Committees have in hand, and  win beused in this way to assist the small farmers until the end of  theharve ot.                       Commercial Divisipn.     SajicJLlag..   The supply of basic slag now appears to be somewhat&quot; in &quot;excess of the demand and some of the wbrks arecomplaining that they are unable to obtain sufficient orders.   a circular has been sent out to over- a thousand merchants informing them that  they can now secure prompt delivery.     Lime.    The experimental plant for grinding chalk which  waserected at Coulsdon last season is giving satisfactory results.   Theoutput during the twelve months of 1918 was  3,861tons, but  the plant was not fully in operation during the  whole  ofthe year,  and the present rate of output is 6.000 tons per annum.The total cost of this plant was about  3.000 and will pay for itself in about five years.   In view of the good results from thisexperiment a circular is being issued to a number of lime  makers,drawing their attention to the advantages of installing a  limegrinding plant and offering tho services of the Board*s engineerto advise  thorn as to the best type  of machinery   etc.
     Ppto sh.   Arrangements have been made &quot;by the Potash ProductionBranch for the importation of potash from Germany in exchange for food.   The quantity to he imported is 22,500 tons of pure potash(K2O).   Fart of this will he required for industrial purposes andthe balanoe will be sold for agriculture.   Tne method of disposal\vnot yet been settled.   It is not likely that this potash willbe available for agriculture till effcer the present season.     M&apos;:,Tketin^:.   Fruit nnd Vegetable Societies h^va recently beenfoTcied i&quot;n&quot;&quot;Oxford - nd Cornwall, but in neither of these counties ^rethe prospects very brilliant, in the former case ewing to lack ofsupplies and in the letter on account of its isolated position.   Itis hoped th:t it will be possible, in conjunction with the AgricultuvaOrg*inie*tion Society Organisers, to encourage the further cultivationot vegetables in Cow/all and to develop fruit preeervatien inOxford, and thus establish both Societies on a fim basis.   TheWorcester Fruit and Vegetable Society which hfd n turnover lastseason of  25,000 ie being viBited with a view to further substantialdevelopment in its trade being secured this coming season.   Atpresent this Society holds ,vn faction twice n week in the Market Place*t Worcester and it is proposed to establish similar auction salesft l&quot;omsgTove &apos;!nd possibly at two centres in Herefordshire.   Thiswould enable produce to be disposed cf from areas which do not &apos;*tpresent send to Worcester.     Transport.   Transport queetione are now being discussed withofficers provisionally rttnohed to the Ministry of Ways and communications, &apos;nd it is proposed that a special examination f:?om a transport point of view should bo made of certain districts whichit is coor Idared desirable to develop from &quot;n agricultural pointof view, namely, Biggl -swage, Holbeach, 33vesham, Cornwall andthe Lleyn Peninsula.
