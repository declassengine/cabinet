Doomjj ic Ths ^itorssiY or dis        is h-majesty&apos;s-H^s covmijaiT  1.   I have read with scrac little dioouiotudo the terms ci tho Bill  to. &quot;be introduced into Parliament in the event cf a strike.  I fully  agree that ii a strike now fete8 rlaco it will mean an assault cn  the community and that the ccommity would he [justified in using  all tits rocourceo in defence.    I think public opinion would be with  the statement of the Leader cf the house that those respurees must  be placed in the hands of tho Government.   The point I aw somewhat  alarmed about is the suggestion that tho officials of the Unions  should bo imprisoned.   I believe such a thing would, be fraught w  with great danger.   . nothing so solidifies Trades union opinion  as punishment cf Trade Union officials,   Trades Unionists may dis-  agroo with tho load given sometimes by their spokesmen, but always.  rally to them if they are prosecuted by authorities.   That has  happened ngsmin over and over again in my experience.   xrosecuticn  never fails to rally tho men to the side of the officials.  &quot;Some-  times an irresponsible ;, or son such as Hams ay, who is serving a  Qe&amp;$enCo of five months, may bo imprisoned withuifc complaints but,  if Ramsay were an official and had boon loc3:od up, for conduct  however foolish in connection with a strike,  the case would be  different.  2. moreover, it anyone is to bo imprisoned it should obviously  bo X..t omillio.  &apos; i/o are faoe to face, however, wit3i tho fact  that his position has been enormously milz^imna strengthened by  recent results.    His reputation has boon enhanced as a result of  the Commission proceedings .   There is no doubt but that ho fairly  empresses the mind or the delegates,   It is doubtful if he voices  the rank and file,  but, if not, his imprisonment would immediately  rally the rank and  file to him.   In fact, tho Government1s chenccs  in the possible conflict depend on the rank end file havin  been  manoeuvred,into the present position and their being divided if a  strike began,   The arrest of Smillie would ot once unite the men  and I am not sure that it would not also estrange public opinion.  3.   nut ii the arrest of omillio is impossible it carries with  it that the arrest or anybody else is also impossible    He of all  men stands cut as the man who is responsible for the present.  position and to lot him go rreo and to cfrost smaller ify would.  brinff discredit upon the Government.   I hope theiofore that if  the Bill goos forward that mattor say be reconsidered or that, if  powers are token they will rows in, unless s erne special provocat-  ion is given, iw the background-4.   Tho principle of tying up tho funds io, in my judgement,ri lit,  and ii it can be effectively done wnll bo the best weaponin the hands or tho Government-    I am not clear as to the pointre londin . or  iving.property,  money or goods.   If this docs notapply so as to prevent tho co-operative societies giving goodson credit then tho Bill should bo strengthened in that direction.Till; Tsi BiAaffil) sTklklkhomer an flum by Lr G.
