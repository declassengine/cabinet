M Tig! MINISTER OF IftJNITIOtiS.        7&apos;   * wish to tying before the War Cabinet  the&quot;following    proposal for the conversion of surplus military huts  in  order    to relieve the housing difficulty, particularly in  connection    with the settlement of ex-soldiers on the land. ....            It is unlikely that any  considerable&apos; number of houses    can be built In a less period than a yearB   During  the next    few months thousands of huts  should bo passed to  the  Disposals    Board of the Ministry1  of Munitions for sale.  It  is suggested    that a large proportion of these could be converted into cot-    tages which would be eminently suitable  for  rural housing.  M-r*    Vincent Harris, F.R.I.B.A., has, under the  instructions  of    Sir Howard Frank, prepared a  model which shows  the  possibilities    of  the proposal and gives  an  accurate idea  of the accommodation    which could bo provided.   It  is  estimated that  the  cost  of  con-    version and re-erection would be from  180  to  200  per hut  to    which must be added the approximate  sale price  of from  50  to     1009 . The total price, therefore, would run from .023.6 to  300    per hut, and might possibly be less  if a number are erected in    one  districte   This would be less  than  half the  cost of ordinary    cottages containing the same  amount  of accommodation. The  huts    with ordinary care  should  last  for  about 20 years9   It  is con-    sidered that a large number would, be ready  for  occupation within    two months of work, being  commenced.            The huts  could be  provided ready for occupation either    under the existing  scheme, or,  if the Cabinet approved,    arrangements  could  be  made, under conditions to be approved,  for    their purchase on  the  instalment plan by., ex-service men and,    possibly     other members  of  the community.  Should this be
agreed to, details as t?o oustructi on  oomplian oe  tfr Jbooal,By-laws, payment, etc. can be arranged in consultation withthe President of the Local Government Board.    &amp;ir James  .Cariniohael, Advisor to the Local Government Board,  fullyconcurs v/ith the proposals,          I feel sure that the s oh erne will go some way to-wards easing the present situation in regard to Housing.It should also assist the Ministry of Munitions in dis-,posing of the huts on advantageous terms,          I am arranging with the Local Authorities forspecimens of the converted huts to be exhibited in fifteencf the principal industrial centres throughout the UnitedKingdom.          Very few Huts have so far been reported to  besurplus, but if  these proposals are approved, pressureshould bo brought to bear an the War Office&apos; and otherDepartments to release the Huts without delay.       -  -22.iii.19,                             ..
