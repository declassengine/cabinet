          tocument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.                      POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT, [March 20,  1919.]                                 FOREIGN OFFICE,   (11133.)        .                                           SPAIN /008.y               MEMORANDUM01THE  SITUATION IN  SPA    SINCE the memorandum of the 24th January was issued Spain has occupieda very unusual amount of space  in the newspapers.   There has been a Cabineccrisis;  there have  been  two rival attempts to solve the Regionalist problem, and much  angry debate in Parliament  and the press; the eternal problem of Moroccohas aroused unusually  articulate hopes  and fears, especially fears, lest  the PeaceConference, inspired by  France, should alter the status quo there to the disadvan-tage of Spain; and there have been grave strikes at Barcelona and elsewhere,  witha general condition of unrest throughout the country.    These are the same four problems which occupied the political stage in January,and there does not seem to be any immediate prospect of any of them being got outof the way.    The least important is probably the first,  the Ministerial situation.   This hasperhaps grown easier during the last two months.  The January memorandum gavereasons for believing that Count Romanones would  remain in  office during thesitting of the Paris Conference.  This prophecy has so far been  justified.  He hasresigned in the interval, and has resumed office all the stronger for his resignation.As a mere party leader  he was far too weak in numbers in the Cortes to remain atthe head of affairs, and his own position may explain a curious attack on the partysystem which he delivered when giving a non-political lecture in January.   he pointed admiringly to the sinking of party differences during the national crisis inEngland, and indirectly asked for support from all parties in the solution of Spain&apos;present difficulties.  So in the same spirit he has recently filled, a vacancy in his cabinet by the appointment of a Conservative.  It is commonly believed that theKing  exercised his great  influence with the  party  leaders to  prevent their  over-.throwing Romanones by a hostile vote in the Chamber.  But in the end the personaljealousies  and intrigues which play such ia large part in Spanish politics,  and areembodied especially in the troublesome personality of Senor Alba, made the PrimeMinister &apos;s situation so  disagreeable that he refused to  go  on without being armed with the whip of  dissolution  with which  to  frighten  or chastise his  opponentsaccording to circumstances.  This he is understood to have obtained by his resigna-tion, the request to resume office having,  it  is assumed,  been  accompanied  by a promise to grant a dissolution if necessary.  More recently, on the 27th February.Romanones has suspended for the  present the sittings of the Cortes.   This may or may not  be followed by a dissolution in the near future.   In communicating theRoyal Decree to Parliament, the Prime Minister said that it was rendered necessary by the obstructive  conduct of the deputies, which  took up  too much time when theattention of Ministers was so fully occupied by the grave condition of the country,and by the discussions  now  going  on at Paris as to the future of Morocco, about which  it was obviously  undesirable that heated debates should be taking place inthe Spanish Chambers.   The Budget, he said, need not legally be passed till July,so there  was no immediate urgency.  He  did not say,  but  probably  felt,  that  itmight be convenient to adjourn the attempt to solve the dangerous Catalan problem in the hope that something may turn up to show a way out of the deadlock.    Senor Cambo himself, the leader of the Regionalists, may well share this feeling,in spite of all his  flaming speeches about the  urgency  of an immediate  settlementof the Catalan question.   He is said to be a man of courage.  But the bravest manin the world would hardly covet the responsibility of governing  Barcelonia at this moment.   Besides  his position is reallv a verv difficult one.  He is between two fires.On the one hand,  there is the  Patriotic League, which has  shown  considerableactivity,and is opposed to Catalan separation  in general.  On  the other hand, the left wing of his Regionalist party distrust and  often attack him.  &quot;They are nervous      ,1130]-411               -                                    B
1of the wealthy commercial section of the party, to which Cambo naturally belongs.getting  complete control of the Catalan Government if it were established, and theyare at direct issue with the official programme in demanding that municipal autho-rity should come  at the same time as Regional.  Moreover, they are probably notvery anxious to see the Regionalist problem solved at all,  as they want to use it asa lever  to upset the Monarchy.   Another  difficulty is the fear of being dominated by  Barcelona  entertained  by  other   Catalan  towns,  such  as  Tortosa  andLerida,    The  result  has   been that  Cambo,  finding  himself attacked by thebusiness element in his party as coquetting  with Syndicalists, while the Syndicalistspublicly declare their  detachment from a policy which they regard as too moderate,was believed to be inclining to a compromise with the Government, which  would.of course, have exposed him to violent abuse from his Extreme Left.   So that hemay well be glad  to have the whole question shelved&apos; unless unconstitutional actionbe taken by the  closing of Parliament.  Indeed, the whole agitation seems  for themoment, to have  quieted down somewhat,  and English observers in Barcelona  goso far as to say it has all through been an affair of journalists and politicians, ratherthan of  the population as a whole, whose feelings whether of hope or fear are muchmore concerned with Syndicalism.    Meanwhile, the two schemes  of autonomy remain before  the country,  or that part of  it which is capable of an interest in constitutional questions.   There is, first of all, the scheme proposed by the Government.   The preamble of this refers to thegeneral  desire for decentralisation felt  throughout  Spain, alluding  especially toCatalonia and the Basque provinces.  It proposes a Parliament for Catalonia of asingle chamber, -two-thirds of the members to be  elected by  universal suffrage, andone-third by the municipalities and universities.   This chamber will choose for itselfan executive Ministry or Council.   There will be a Governor appointed by the King.that is,  by the authorities  at Madrid, and he will have power to suspend the pro-mulgation of laws believed to be ultra vires,  reserving them, for  the decision of theSupreme Court at Madrid,  as well as, with the consent of the Madrid Cabinet, to dissolve the Parliament.  He also has the  right of regulating  the press and public meetings.   The Bill  expressly reserves the &quot; absolute sovereignty of the Cortes,&quot;which retains power to &quot; determine or rearrange the limits or autonomy.&quot;   By  its provisions either Spanish or the Catalan language may be used officially, but Spanishmust be taught in the primary schools.    The so-called &quot;Statute,&quot; which is the scheme set forth by the  Catalan Man-comunidad, and  described by them and the Catalan deputies as their irreducibleminimum,  goes, of course, further than this.  In the first place, it seems that it is3to have all powers not expressly reserved to the Central authority.  Then the Par-liament  proposed  by it has two chambers, one being a Senate elected by the Munici-municipalities, and the Governor,  though appointed by Madrid, is, in regard to his CatalanMinisters, in the  position of a constitutional Sovereign, and. will have little  power.The Regional Government is to be sovereign in  its  own  sphere, with  no  appeal against  its decisions; but in the event of its enactments encroaching upon the rightsof the Central Government, the Spanish Parliament has the right to declare suchenactments void.    Presumably,  though  it is not clear in.  the only  accessible  text,the question whether there has or has not been encroachment will be decided by the parliament of Spain or by the Supreme Court, as in the Government Bill.    As  it is quite possible that neither of them will be discussed  again, it is not worthwhile to describe them in  greater detail.   Their differ aces  do not appear to aforeigner to be so great as one might expect.   An examination of  them  ratherconfirms the view taken by good judges both Spanish and foreign, that if the Sessionhad run its normal course an agreed compromise might have been arrived at betweenthe Government  and at least the more  moderate elements in the  Catalan party.And this may yet be the case.  It has come out by an indiscretion of Alba&apos;s that thepoliticians had come  to some sort of agreement when Romanones took office thatRegionalism  should be &quot; examined,&quot; but, in fact, shelved.  Romanones is accusedby Alba of breaking this agreement by trying to solve the problem.   He denies this,but. anyhow, he  cannot go  too  far in concessions to Barcelona, as Madrid, and,in deed, the whole of Spain as represented in  the Chamber, is altogether hostile to anything  like  a surrender to  Cambo such as would involve a break-up of the unity of Spain.   Still,  he has evidently gone further than the rest,  and to the out-sider it would seem  that  all the sensible ,;Regionalists who want reform and notrevolution  would do wiselv to come to terms with him.   One would suppose, forinstance, that they might be granted their two chambers, if they desire them, and
the Governor might perhaps be confined to a purely constitutional role,  providedthat, on the other hand, the Australian system of giving to the Region all powersnot expressly reserved to the National Government be abandoned, and the oppositeCanadian and South African system of leaving the. Dominion or Federal or national government all powers not expressly conceded to  the local Government,  be adoptedm its place.   There would  also have to be provisions to ensure that the decisionsof the Madrid or Supreme Court as to  whether any action of Barcelona was ultravires could be quickly and effectively enforced.    However, for the moment at least  the question is shelved,  it was not one ofthe two problems whose gravity was given by the Prime Minister as the reason forclosing the Cortes.  The first of these was Morocco; and especially the danger to spanish interests involved in the demands being put forward by France, both official-ally at the Peace Congress and still more in the Paris press.    There is no doubt that the French, with the  megalomania which seems to haveseized them since victory was assured, are aiming at the ultimate control of the wholenorth-west of Africa.  If they  can  secure naval supremacy in  the mediterranean and get rid of the  Spanish zone,  they will, they  think, ultimately make  Franceextend from Lille to the Congo.  There is  no reason to suppose that even if all theother interested parties stood  aside  in her faivour, France will ever possess themeans of carrying through such an ambitious programme.   Meanwhile, however,she is taking the first steps, and M.  de  Perretti, on her behalf, has  frankly told thePeace -Congress that she demands the&apos; abrogation of the Act of Algeciras, which atpresents  limits her  action in Morocco  in  certain respects; and she complains, byhis voice, in the nanie of the Sultan, that &quot; the national integrity of the ShereefianEmpire has been assailed  and arbitrarily infringed by withdrawing  certain portions of the Empire from the Sultan&apos;s authority.&quot;  This means, of course, a demand forthe whole Spanish  zone.   But such a. demand is not expressly put forward.  Whatis expressly put forward  is a demand for  Tangier, to refuse which is described byM. de Peretti as refusing France  &quot; the key of the house in which she lives.&quot;  TheFrench excuses for this demand are that Spain refused to sign the arrangement madefor its international administration and signed by France and Great Britain;  thatthe international administration, besides proving a failure, has lapsed, owing to theinaction of Spain, and Tangier must naturally revert to the authority of the Sultan,that is of France, who will, however, give it a special, though not  an internationalregime.    Our attitude towards all  this has been one  of friendly  reserve, and ofreminding France that, while we may be willing to abolish the Act of Algeciras,there were other  parties  to it,  -and notably Spain, who must be consulted.    Stillmore must Spain,  who considers ,her rights in  Tangier  at least equal to those of France,  he consulted on  that question.  Moreover we point out that  the Franco- Spanish  Treaty of 1912 at least, which has ever since been the recognised basis ofall negotiations between France and Great Britain concerning Morocco clearly intendsthe regime for Tangier to be international since it was not to be either  French or Spanish; and our recognition of the French Protectorate in 1914 was given on the expressed understanding that  France  would co-operate &quot;in carrying through thenegotiations for internationalising Tangier, which Spain is known  to be now ready tc complete.     This attitude  has naturally caused gratification at Madrid, where it is further pointed  out  in reply to the French assertions of there being only  one Protectorate in Morocco,  their own, that those who,  like the &quot;  Temps,&quot; make such assertions have clearly not read article 25 of  the  Treaty of November 1912, in  which the  word &quot;Protectorate&quot;  is equally  employed in reference  to  the Spanish  zone.   Like ourselves Spain is willing to assent to the removal of the restrictions laid upon France by the Act of A^geciras,  demanding the same freedom in her own  zone for herself. For the rest, as Romanones has said both in public and in private, her attitude  must be a quite unyielding insistence on the status quo ante helium.  Her failure to help the Allies forbids her, as things are, to ask more, but she cannot accept less  than this: her own zone, that is, in its integrity, for herself;  and  Tangier,  which  is entirely  surrounded by her zone, if not under Spanish at least  under international control.     At   first sight the two  positions  would appear to threaten  serious conflict. But the  Peace Conference is believed  not to be anxious to occupy itself with the subject:  and the French fully admitted the rights oif Spain  to be consulted and seem ultimately to have confined themselves to  asking the Powers represented to consent to the abolition of the Act of Algeciras. Moreover General Lyautey, to whom nearly       11130] 411                                                    B2
  all the admitted success of the French in Morocco is due, is believed to advise this  Government against putting too great pressure on Spain.  Nor is the French Govern-  ment likely to persist in attempts to possess itself of Tangier in the teeth of British  protests.   It will probably be content  with  getting free of the limitations  of the  Algeciras  Act and  making its- own zone purely  French, economically as well as  politically, which, in spite of  its promise to maintain the &quot; open door,&quot; it  can pro-  bably do without difficulty.  Meanwhile Spain is making what atonement she  can  for her past misdeeds  by sending  a Franco-phil  governor to  administer  her  zone  and directing him to consult with Lyautey as to future  operations against trouble-  some natives.  She has also, at Trench request, refrained from occupying  the Ifni  patch in South Morocco which was  admitted to be hers  in 1912.      For her the  question is largely one qf national pride. It is little felt by the  lower classes, and occasionally the - press and speakers of the Left advocate total  abandonment of Morocco.  This Rodes,  an ex-Minister, went near doing in a  recent  debate in which also his leader, Cambo, declared Spain had no gift for colonizing,  so that in her hands the best colony was worthless.   This  may be true, but the King,  the Army,   and  the  official classes are undoubtedly behind the Prime Ministers  declaration,  that Spain must not yield a square inch of the territory, im  which  they see the last remnant of  their colonial  Empire.     The Gibraltar agitation, which was probably  fomented by French. Chauvinists  ii! the hope of producing  friction between us and Spain  and preventing our giving  Spain  any  support  against France, seems to have quite  collapsed.  The Prime  Minister refused to speak of it in Parliament and has said in private that it was  a purely sentimental question and  one of which no one in  Spain was  seriously  thinking,  while one  Spanish  paper has admitted that  the town was  realty  an  English one.  It is  worth  noticing that the Spanish African League have just  issued a manifesto in which they set out the arguments against a surrender of Ceuta and evidentially regard&apos;&quot;it as of greater value  to Spain than Gibraltar.  In the  same  document they denounce, with great truth, the failure of the International system of administration at Tangier,  though they prefer it of course  to handing that city over to France.  There  seems  some force if little novelty in their arguments, that Spain cannot accept  the  establishment of another foreign Power in the  Straits, that her influence in her zone  would be hopelessly  undermined  if Tangier which is surrounded  by it and is its most important city  were handed over  to any  other country, and that by all the tests of population and business  the town is mainly Spanish.  But good arguments do not necessarily decide  political issues even when stated as well as they will no doubt be by Senor Hontoria whom the Spanish  Govern- ment has just sent to Paris and.who knows as much about Morocco as any Spaniard and is besides a man  of sense and ability.  Besides the French will reply by  another argument which cannot  be called  a bad  one, the necessity of order and progress in Morocco and their own  success and the Spanish failure in producing either.   The result will probably be that  both the Spanish zone and the international regime at Tangier will get a reprieve to  see if  they, can mend their ways. But that is at best a very uncertain hope, and it may be that the recent conciliatory attitude of Spain in Morocco,  and  the fact that  the French have not pressed their extreme claims at Paris, are indications that whatever language may be used in  public, both parties are really preparing to make a bargain  on  the basis of French purchase of  some of the rights and possessions  of Spain.     The other cause  given by  the Prime Minister for the suspension of the Cortes is the grave internal conditions of the country.  There have been strikes in many parts of  the country, and  the guarantees have had  to be suspended (not the same thing as martial law, but only  a kind of suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, the right of public meetings, &amp;c),  for a day or two at Madrid and for much longer at Barcelona, where  martial law was also  for a short  time proclaimed.   The crisis at Madrid was brief and apparently not  very grave.   That at  Barcelona has been prolonged and was most serious,  the city being at times almost  deprived  both cf light and transport.   Indeed, the  strikes seem to have affected nearly all the neces-sary public services, including the water supply.  Finally  the Government mobilisedthe strikers,  but of some 1,500 mobilised it is said  that 600 refused to  appear andwere imprisoned.  But they are now to be released without punishment as one ofthe terms of the settlement, which  appears to be an almost complete victory for theSyndicalists, who have  successfully terrorised, first, the  men  who. according  tocompetent observers,  did not desire  to  strike and  felt  no particular grievancesabout their terms cf employment, then the city, and then the Government of Spain.
I  They appear even to have established a &quot;red censorship &quot; over the press through1  the compositors in reply to the censorship of the authorities.       What will be the result of such a victory it is hard to say.  It can scarcely fail1  to  stimulate similar activities in other parts of Spain.   No doubt Barcelona isI  always the most disturbed place in Spain.  . Moreover, crime is always common inI  Spain,  and it may be that such a portent as the fact  acknowledged in the  CortesI  that over sixty  employers of  labour had been murdered by undiscovered criminalsI  is not nearly so grave in Spain  as it would be in  England.   But  there is no doubt   that the Spanish people, like every people in Europe, is at present  caught up in a1  wave of excitement and  unrest.  There is a real demand  for political and socialI  reform among all who think and feel, as well as revolutionary agitation  amongI   those who feel without thinking or intrigue without either.  . Some of the results of   all this are excellent.  No friend of Spain or of honest government can feel anything   but rejoicing at the startlingly sudden downfall of the all-powerful &quot; Cacique &quot;  (or   local &quot; boss &quot;) of Granada.   Caciquism prevails in too many parts  of Spain.  The   strangest thing  about it is that it appears to be more or less independent of party   politics.   On the old  system  a Minister made the elections as a whole,  but  he did   not try to interfere with the authority of the Cacique where one was regularly e?tab-   lished,  as  he could  get a sufficient majortiy without doing this.  Till lately there   seems to have been little resistance  to the  system.   But there were two  things   against it  at Granada.   One was that a reforming Professor, a man of brains and   character,  had  instilled new life into  the University,  which had been  practically   dead.   And,  strangely enough, though  not  an orthodox Catholic, he  had  the.   support of the  Archbishop.   The other fatal thing was the outrageous extent to   which the Cacique,  one La Chica, had carried his insolence and corruption.  The   Mayor was his  brother, and the Governor was in his pocket and  he did exactly as   he pleased, going so far as to have double taxes paid half  for himself and half for   the State.   No one resisted, not even the Syndicalists.   Suddenly the students   rose, crying,  &quot;Down with Caciquism! &quot;  and though  the  police and troops were   called out,  the Cacique had to fly for his life, the Governor and the Mayor resigned,   and the Prime  Minister in  the  Chamber had the courage to denounce the whole   system to  which so many members owe their seats.  Pie at once appointed  a new   Governor.       But disorder,  even in a  good cause,  is  dangerous, especially in such times  as   the present,  The burning of buildings connected with  the  objectionable Cacique   might be made a precedent for similar  proceedings without  even, that excuse.  The   whole situation is  undoubtedly very alarming,  and almost the  only encouraging   feature in  it is the  fact that  both at Barcelona and at  Granada the troops seem to   have discharged their very difficult duty with great success, having been at once,   loyal to their officers  and conciliatory to the people.   Good judges feel confident   that if a revolutionary outbreak occurs, such  as private  reports  say is   being   organised  for April or May, the Army will  remain faithful to the Crown and   Government.  It will be still  better if these reports once more, as often previously,   prove to have no foundation  in fact and no attempt at  revolution  takes place.o   0
