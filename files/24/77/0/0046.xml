REPORT relating  to the work of the Board of Agriculture for  Scotland for the week ending 26th March 1919.

I. FOOD PRODUCTION.

1. Compulsory Order under Defence of tho Roalm Regulation 2.M.

The Board have  withdrawn from possession of a grass  park at Inveralmond, Perthshire taken over by them       on 24th May, 1918 to provide accommodation for stock displaced from farms on  which increased cultivation had been undertaken.

2. Defence of the Roalm Regulation 2.L.

(a) The Board have given their sanction to a proposal by the Town Council of Cockenzie and Port Soton to enter on 3 acres or, thereby of the Cockenzie and Port Soton Golf Course, for the purpose of continuing its a cultivation an allotments until such time as the ground is required for building purposes.

(b) The Board gave their sanction to tho Lorwick Town Council to enter on a portion of the Globe extending to  about one and a half acres, for the purpose of cultivating it as allotments.

3. Tractor operations.

Up to 15th February last applications had been received by District Agricultural Executive Committees from   farmers for the following work to be undertaken by Tractor for 1918-19 cultivation.

Ploughing - Loa 2391 acres

Ploughing  Stubblo, etc.  6004 acres

Cultivating  152 acres

Grubbing 900 acres 

Other Operations 112 acres 

The returns for the four-weekly period to 15th March have not yet been furnished, but the work on a large      proportion of the above acreages has been completed during the past month, and applications are still being received for ploughing and other spring work.

Ploughing operations were handicapped by the frosty weather which prevailed in many parts of Scotland in January and February.  In those districts no ploughing Could be attempted during the period between the end of December and the end of February. This has caused an increased demand for Tractor outfits and difficulty may be experienced by the Committee in carrying out all the operations required.

4. Supply  of Fertilisers.

?itrato of Soda.

The Board understand that the orders of Nitrato of Soda for farmers in Scotland amounting in all to 840 tons collected by the Board, have been executed by the Ministry of Munitions from stocks in their possession for war purposes.

5.  Control/
5. Control of Fertilisers.

As mentioned in a previous report the control of the Ministry of Munitions over the distribution and prices of fertilisers will be discontinued as from 31st May. The question of the necessity for maintaining in the interests of agriculture, a modified measure of control has been en-gaging the attention of the Boards of Agriculture, and a conference was held recently between representatives of the Departments and of the manufacturers of basic slag at which it was agreed that a schedule of fixed prices for this fertiliser should be adopted for the period from 1st June, to 31st May, 1920. Arrangements were also made for the continuance of the system of pooling delivery charges on the understanding that the administration of the equalisation fund will be left in tho hands of the English and Scottish Boards of Agriculture.

II. COLLECTION OF STATISTICS and RETURNS relating to AGRICULTURE.

Monthly Returns of Live Stock.
