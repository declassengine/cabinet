                 \    j  &apos;                             91    MR, THOMAS.  MS^Jiohar Law, this meeting thismorning is, I think, the first of the kind thathas ever taken place.  We have been negotiating asrailwaymen with the Government for a considerable period on vhat you know to be our National ProgrammeVarious offers were made by the Government and ultimate-ly those offers were submitted in accordance withour constitution to a special delegate meeting whichwas held on Thursday.  After a very long discussion and a full explanation of all the Govanrneiit1 s pro-posals, the delegate meeting not only rejecte^theoffer but intimated their intention to declare astrike, believing that the programme submitted toyou was the irreducible minimum which the railwaymencould accept.  I was further instructed to convey thatdecision to the body known as the &quot;Triple Alliance&apos;1&apos;which, as you are aware, is composed of the miners, thetransport- workers and ourselves, and as the rezulttf the influence-of that body at its meeting last night it was decided that, although they had no right to interfere with what may be called the internal affairs of any Union, they did have a right,  as an alliance, te see whether the united efforts of thisbady cnuld not effect a settlementC  You will appreciateSir, that when a decision is taken to declare a strike,deliberately and carefully thought out, and especially when it applies to a body like the railwaymen, it is avery serious affair, and it speaks, I think,  for theinfluence of this &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; that they not onlydecided to invite the Government to meet them, but inaddition to that, they asked the railwaymen to suspend the strike notice until this interview took place.Therefore, you will clearly see that the delegates a tour meeting Fill hear cur report, and on that report
they will decide as to whether- they will put into operation thedecision that they came to yesterday,   -That, shortly, is thecase.-   You know the National Programme j  you know all too well that there is no class of workers in this country that- has been so badly paid.  -That&apos; is admitted by every Government spokesman..It is true to soy to-day that the railway profits and the railwaysuccess were built upon the sweated labour of railmymen.   It isalso true to nay that by a system, to-day happily obsolete, railwaydirectors and management insisted upon meeting the grades of theirown employees and fixing up different arrange]&quot;ents, and vMlstthey may have felt then that that was the ri .ht way, theGovernment, I think, would be the first to  Frm.it to-day that that very system is the cruse-&apos; of most of our trouble, because it hasresulted In so many anomalies, as Sir Albert -Stanley knows.V-&apos;ith 128 grades In the&apos;service of 70 odd railway companies, thereis no grade paid on the same principle;  and the sawe -grades inthe same town, living, under the same conditions are all gettingvarying rates* &apos;  -The result Is that that must inevitably lead to&apos;friction and dissatisfaction, and it has culminated in the spirit and temper that e.&quot;ist to-day. .  &apos;The only oth^r point they feel Isthat&apos;in 1914 - and it is important that the Government should&apos;keep&apos;-that clearly in mind - they had launched what&apos;is called a national programme.-   No-one,&apos; either from that side  or this, couldaccurately say what would have been the result of that programme,but no-one will deny that some material advantage to the men would have accrued fror. it,&apos;  But the war intervened and, although they were  then smarting under rhr.t I have already described aswretched conditions, they felt that  the national issue of the rrarwas such that they were
warranted, in suspending their operations, with theresult that they did suspend them ei d the Governmentpromised them    the previous Prime Minister, thepresent Prime Minister, and practically everyoneconnected vrith the Government, said without hesitationthat they not only appreciated that action, Out that the railwaymen should not suffer for it v:hen the time came.Now they feel that the time has come to redeem thatpromise and they feel that that four-years 1 effort,coupled with what I have said about the suspension oftheir improvements, ought to find expression not inresolutions of thanks but practical expression in animprovement of their conditions of service.  They have put bofora the Government what they believe to be a reason-able programme;  they have put before the Government whatthey believe to be a standard of life that trey areentitled to; they have put before the Government a pre-gramme that they believe ought to be reasonably concedednot because it would benefit them.as railwaymen, but because they believe that, as railwaymen, they are entitledto those conditions.  They have had regard all throughta what I have called the public interest,  I do not know, Sir, whether you want me to go in detail through .the programme, but I have briefly summarised the situation,and I conclude by saying, - de not minimise the gravity ofit.  It is perfectly true that the miners Mr-Smillie willcorrect me if I am wrong - have, temporarily suspended the stoppage on Monday by their people, but that does not mean that we have either temporarily, or in any vayvetoed the possibility of a stoppage even to-night and the Triple Alliance are.here this morning because theyare anxious to avoid, a stoppage, b ecau.se they want, if
                                                      it 4passible, to pull through this crisis without a stoppage,knowing the&apos;-consequences that would follow.  I wouldbeg of you not to minimise the seriousness of the pcs-Ition, not only from the point of view of the railway-men, but what I would call the moral obligation on thepart of these three bodies to help each other, because X  .cannot too strongly say that although the miners havetemporarily suspended their notice and the transportworkers are in a position that they may perhaps cometo an agreement,&apos; yet if any one of these bodies stops, the moral obligation and the. spirit cf comradeship are such that they render it inevitable that the whole threewill be together, and if the three are together inthese disputes, you know that what ever to-day maybe the grievances without a strike, a new set of circum-stances will operate immediately a strike takes placeI hcpe I have not put it too strongly or too forcibly,but I want you clearly to understand there is no min-imising the gravity and seriousness of the position from both our point of view.     MR. bonar LAW.   I should like to ask you to dealwith two points before I say anything.  You may not agree to say this.  You are here as a Triple Allianct.and there is some obligation of a sympathetic kindbetween the three bodies.  Even though the grievances ofone body do not justify a strike in their case, all threebodies, would come out.  Is that sc?     MR. THOMAS,  Yes.   Fe are not afraid to put&apos;all our cards on the table.  Mr. Smll.ie or- Mr,Gosling,or anyone else may put their interpretation uporf-it, but what I say is clearly that if the miners stop work largenumbers of railwayman will automatically be thrown outjust as large numbers of transport workers will be.  our experience of that was In 1912, when for seven weeks the miners were on   /
                    -5-                                     95strike..   During those seven weeks my own Union paid 94,000 in dispute pay to our own men affected by thatstrikefi  They felt that that was not the way.   Just asCapital says,  &quot;We must organise our forces,  and in the  eventof a struggle mobilise our forces to the best advantage/&apos;   so  we feel that as Labour1, in a fight we must mobilise our forces to the best advantage0&apos;   I say, without hesitation, thatthere is undoubtedly that agreement, not in writing, butobviously there is a moral obligation one towards the other.     MR. BONAR LAW.   I should like you to tell me, withregard to the railwaymen&apos;s position,  whether,  apartfrom the general principle, there are  any particular items that you would like us to reconsider and on which you would like to say anything to me.     MR. THOMAS.   That is very difficult, because as  I said to you, and you should clearly understand it, theoffer is rejected as a whole, and I would not be carryingout my mandate if I said to you,  &quot;Yes, but a concession on any one point will not meet the situation^&quot;   You understandthat.   On the other hand, I do not want to be put in an unfair position, nor to put you In ail unfair position,   by not clearly telling you this, if that Is what you mean9     MR. BONAR LAW,   Yes,     MR,- THOMAS,   This is our difficulty.   The Governmentintimated to us, not unfairly,  but quite fairly, after we hadgpne through this programme on Wednesday, or whenever itwas  , Sir Albert Stanley, -who occupied the position youare occupying as Chairman of the Conference, was asked by mewhether, in taking these proposals to our people, that wasthe last word of the Government.   He answered, &quot;Yes&quot;,.   That -was made clear to my people, but it is equally fair to say thatin giving the explanation, there was a strong feeling about what I might call the definition of even the principles of it--                                       - *
ambiguity in the language of the definition of theprinciple, as to which they frankly said,  &quot;The railwaycompanies&apos; hands are in this, and it is only anotherattempt to put something on paper that in actual practicecan be wiped out.&quot;   Take tho night-work clause forinstance.   \&apos;e wont bade to our men and said to them,&quot;Sir Albert Stanley, on behalf of the Government,although the railway companies do not agree, franklyaccepted the principle of night-work,&quot;     SIR ALBEilT oTANLBY.   Of all night - work *                                       a     MR. THOMAS.   That we look upon as/tremendouslyvaluable thing and very important to our men.   But when we got to the clause giving effect to what he called hisprinciple,  the hands of the railway companies were there.In other words, they&quot; said, &quot;All right, -Sir Albert -Stanleyhas given way on this, but we will show how Sir albert stanley&apos;s principle can be meaningless.&quot;   I do notaccuse him;  I am quite sure he did not knaw the detailsof it, but I am absolutely certain, and did not hesitate to tell my men as I tell you, that the hands of therailway companies were there.   They said,&quot;Yes, butwe will put in ,,ords that no matter what Sir Albertotanley may say can be made meaningless on this veryprinciple.&quot;  For instance, these are the words.   ,&apos;easked that an enhanced rate should be paid for night-work from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the morning.   Sir Albert Stanleysaid, &quot;Yes, it is unreasonable for a man coning on at,say, 12..o*clock in the day  and finishing at 6.0 at nightto call that night-work, and it is common in railwaywork.&quot;  &quot;But&quot;, he said? &quot;I can quite agree that there arecircumstances of.real night-work, a real night turn thatought to be paid for, and I will give you an offer.&quot;- SirAlbert Stanley will correct me if I am unfairly puttingwhat he said.
                    r7                  *&quot;* f         ALBERT bTANLEY.   I said that  in those  instances where men are engaged upon what I&apos; defined, for want  of  abetter term, as all-night-work, which imposed some burdenupon the household, I thought those were cases that required special consideration and we must try to find  a definition or formula which Till cover that.   That  is  theformula put forward on the advice of the railway companies.     MR. THOMAS.   Yes, and see what it means.   That proveswhat I say.   That is the formula you put forward:-  &quot;Aspecial payment of l/6d a night shall be paid to any man who, having commenced duty before 12 midnight, is kept  on duty until after 2,0 a.m., or is booked on for a turn of duty between 12.0 midnight and 4 a.m.&quot;   At first sightyou would think that would cover the two hours.  -  You see how simple it looks;  the principle is simple; but see  howit works out in.practice.   Eight&apos; hours is tho working  day.The goods workers  in every town in the country are bookedon at 6 o!clock at night for their night  shift and they bookoff at 2 of clock,     SIR ALBERT STANLEY.   May I have this clear for my information.?     MR. BONAR  LAW.   I am sure you will agree, Mr. Thomas,that we cannot, at this Conference, go into details cfthat kind   I  do  not mean the principle  you  are dis-cussing.     MR. THOMAS *   That is my difficulty.     MR, BONAR  LAW.   Explain the principle of it.     MR, T OKAS.   Yes, I will content myself by showingyou the effect  of  the clause.-   I have the whole ofthem, but I seize  upon  this  as an illustration.   Evenif if is all that  you  say here, the men are being deprived of something.   This clause  says, if a man commencesafter 2 of clock he gets it;  but he does  not  finish after
                            mm   M2,0, he finishes at 2,0 and commences at 6.0 and thatdeprives every man of the very principle that isconceded,     MR. bonar LA&apos;,:.   I ffollow that,     MR, THOMAS.   It is the same in the morning between12.0 o&apos;clock midnight and 4,0 a.m.     MR. BONAR LA&apos;7.   I understand that.     MR. THOMAS.   Again, you know that no agreement made by the Government - and Mr, Williams is here whohas made agreements outside the Government with private employers, - there has been no agreement made with anybody of men that contemplates any reduction whatsoeverin wages,  notwithstanding the reduction in hours.   ThatIs another point which I will deal with later on.   here is our difficulty,.a difficulty which the Government haveto recognise.     SIR ALBERT STANLEY.   You have finished with regardto night-work?     MR. THOMAS.   Yes.   Mr. Bonar Law intimated thathe did not want it developed.     MR. BONAR LAW.   Only because I think I understandit.     MR. THOMAS.   What I. have said has illustrated thepoint.   There are 100,000 of our members who are shop-men.   You know the loyalty of Trade Unionists.   Whenfolks talk about the loyalty of Trade Unionists and thespirit of comradeship, I have to say this to you,-every Victoria Cross won in this oar was won by comradeship;the comradeship that made men risk their lives on the battle-field   the saiiie kind of comradeship we expect and encouragein our own labour movement.
            Here are 100,000 men, members of ours, and. nine orten delegates cut of the 60, .ho are shopmen.  This programmed could do everytl;ing - the offer of the Government could do everything they desire, but even if it was so these men simplysay &quot;But re are ruled out&quot;.  Here are 100,000 men that you&apos;,the Government, say you cannot make an agreement for.  Butvhat is even more important than that, although you havestabilised \ ages in the Conciliation Grades for the moment,these men &apos;turn round and say &quot;So far as ve, 100,000 of yourmembers, are concerned, there is no guarantee for our stab-ilised  age at all&quot;,  You will not even make an agreement.I knor the Government say &quot;Yes, but there is the differencebetween the Unions&quot;.  I kno: that, but that does not alter thefact that ve go to these men and. say  &quot;There is no guaranteeat all for you&quot;, and. \.e have to admit, it frankly,  I could go through the \ hole of - the programme in the same ray and shoryou that; in the considered judgment  of our men, they askfor a standard, of living that they believe is represented  inthis programme.  They serve the public, they have  served theGovernment, but&apos;, they say quite deliberately, neither to makeprofits for tho railway companies nor to a 11or the british public tc travel cheaply, - if that  is involved -  are theygoing to allow their conditions to be such as provide comfort and. cheapness  for other people at the expense of  themselves and their families.  That,  shortly is the  case that  re present             i-jR, BONAR  LA1.&apos;.:  &apos; hr.  Thomas and Gentlemen, &quot;henyou  asked me to see  you  I was delighted  to do it,  and  I  doit more readily because  I believe  that those  &quot;ho  are hereto-day  are as  an:-ions  to avoid a  strike  as I  am myself,   Ibelieve those  I am  addressing are  as  anxious  as  I am,   (Hearhear).  I can  assure you,  i.&apos;.r. Thomas, that there  is  no dangerof my minimising the  seriousness  of  the  position.   If  any-                                               perhaps.thing,  although  I do not  think  so,  I am.  inclined/to  think  it
more serious than it may turn out to be.            MR. CRAMP:  You cannot do that.  .            MR&apos;. BONAR LAV&apos;;;  At all events 1 do not make the ethererror of minimising it-.  As regards the railvsymen&apos;s position,I rill tell you in a minute vhy Sir Albert Stanley was justified on behalf of the Government in saying In general terms that thatwas the most we could do as a. Government,  But I do not wish -and ,1 hope you \ 111 believe that is true not only of me but ofall the Government - that the danger of a strike should be in-creased, by any feeling of amour progre;. because we have said thisIs the last offer that we could make;, to talk about the defini-ticn or the methods by which the principle of tho offer could bemade more acceptable to you.  That I am perfectly ready to have considered, and I \ ill say a word or two about these specific points that Mr. Thomas has raised.  I Till take first of all thepoint that he mentioned almost last, about the loyalty of thedifferent members of the Labour movement to each other, whicheveryone recognises, and without which your movement could notbe successful,  That spirit is tho cause of the success and ofthe way in which all their men stick together:  But we are inthis difficulty,  that the railwayman are not all represented byone Union.  Sir Albert Stanley and Sir Robert Home hove had tohave negotiations not only with you- and Mr. Thomas but with another, and I do not think the Government could properly makeany arrangement,  even in regard to definitions, without theother Union.  That is right, is it not ?            SIR ALBERT STANLEY:  Yes,            i.R,&apos; BOWAR LA&apos;&apos;.:  Being made aware of it at tho time we were doing- it.  Subject to that I am perfectly ready ------            i.iK. THOMAS:  It is rather important,  You aretalkinh now of the Associated Society.
            MR, BONAR LAW:   Yea,            MR. THO;AS:.  Por the moment 1 am dealing v:with the shopmen,            1VR.. BONAR LAV;:   I was coming to that.  I wasspeaking of the night shift work -  Subject to that, as regardsthe night work, we discussed the whole of these con-cessions at great length in the Cabinet as a whole.The understanding of the Cabinet was that the offer was for extra paw  for a real night  shift,  I remember it  sowell.   Y/hat Y;O meant was that it should apply to realnight work, but that, it should  not apply to cases such as-you gave where, because it overlaps 6 o1clock and is  reallyday work, the  demand for night  pay should be made.  Such acase as you gave me of eight hours a day or an eight  hoursnight, which is really a night  shift, is intended to  be&apos;treated as a night shift,  and the more fact thai, it doesnot go beyond  2 o&apos;clock would not make any differencecertainly to us.  As regards that I  should be perfectlyready on behalf of the Government to  say that the  Boardof Trade and the  hinistry  of Labour  would, be  quite  willingto discuss, with  those with whom they discussed  it  before,their interpretation of anything of  that kind,             KR. THOhAS&apos;^  I hope I am not  interrupting,  butthis is too  important  to us.  Bo you mean bv  that  thatthe very illustration  that I have given  of the  offer made, which ..as rejected by us,fj3 contrary to what  theGovernment  intend,  that is to  say that  if  a man bookson duty at  6  o!clock and  finishes at 2  o&apos;clock,  that  isa  night  shift  ?  .             ;.R.  - -OMR  LA A:  That  is  so,  is  it not  SirAlbert  ?             SIR ALBERT STANLEY:  I  should not like to
-12-102say that.  I am not clear upon that Mrs Thomas.  I will quotefrom what we said to you the day before yesterday.  This is the definition of the principle that we agreed with you and the other people.  If the hours we have given you do not set that forthaccording to this principle, we&apos;shall.haye to reconsider it.What I said was this :-                 &quot;SIR ALBERT STANLEY:  The next item I deal with            is the question of night duty.  What is asked hero                                                       shall            is, as I understand it,, that time and a half/be paid          &apos;  for all time worked between 6 o&apos;clock at night and            6 o&apos;clock the following morning,                 ,JU THO: AS:  Yes.                 SIR ALBERT STANLEY:  I suggest here&apos;that there            is, perhaps unintentionally, something really unreason-            able in a suggestion of this kind.  There are verv many            services, with some of i hich I am very familiar here in            London,&apos; where the men are booked on at some hour in the            day, and their  ork gees on, because of the needs of the            traffic, for some little time after 6 o&apos;clock that night.            It does seem to re that it Is unreasonable to suggest            that those men should be paid a special rate for the ?ork            which they do after 6 o&apos;clock at night.  On the other            hand, I myself should be inclined to agree that there            is a good case in those circumstances where men ere            vorking all night.  There I should think myself there            is a good case for giving some special consideration            to those men who are compelled to work practically            the -/hole of the night, because it does really involve            to .those who dislike it, inconvenience , and I have no            doubt in a good many cases soije, additional cost to their            household, because thov are - orking different hours from            the great mass of the workpeople of the country.  I            should thirlk&apos; in that case there is somothingthat might be               r                    V..
        said in favour of those men, &quot;but for myself I should        not think, if it is intended to be that ray, and that        is hor.&apos; I understand this Clause, that in all instances        irrespective of the time tho men book on and the time        they book off, so long as they rork any time at all        beyond 6 o1clock that night, that they should for that        time be allowed special pay.&quot;     That is what was said,, and if\the figures which have beenput in, which I read to you at tho time of your investigation,do not bear that out, I suggest we should have another meeting to go into it, with yourself and the other peoole, to see whether we cannot agree to  a substitution,     I&quot;r. THOMAS:   &quot;&apos;&quot;e have to go back to the Conference andwe want to re wort accurately to them,:.   I do not know whether you, Sir Albert Stanley, in reading out what you have said there, believe that when a man woes on at 6 o:clock at night and finishes at 2 a.m0? which is a full turn of duty, that   - .was intended to cover night work as you say0     Sir ALBERT STANLEY:   I could not agree to rive an answer to that now.     Mr. BONAR LAW;   I think I can rive an answer that oughtto be satisfactory.   &apos;&quot;e cannot go into details here as to how the thing is to be met.  . But  what the Government meantis exactly what I have said to you.   &apos;&quot;e discussed whether or                                eivennot there  should be  am allorrance/ror night workc   It is cuiteobvious, where night work begins and ends In a trade like yours,when people are booked on and off at all hours, it is difficult.to define-.   But there is no doubt whatever it is  our intention that where there is real all-night work they should be paidextra for  it.   Is that sufficiently.plain?                          -13-
     Mr. THOMAS:   Yes.   I Interpret that clearly as a definition that the Government give as to all-night work -6 p,m, to 2.;&apos;&amp;cm*4,   That is a very clear definition under thatcategory.     Mr. BONAR LAW;   You will see that I am not hedging inany way hut I would rather not deal with interpretations.     Mr. THOMAS:   You know also ry difficulty.   I amdeparting somewhat, in this cross-table conversation, fromthe terms of the resolution.,     Mr. BONAR LAW:   I understand,     Mr, THOMAS:   If on the other hand, a resolution was arrived at and you say &quot;yre meant something else&quot;, clearly itis common sense to hove that rectified.   That is all,     Mr. BONAR LA1&apos;&apos;:   Without adding  anything to what was our intention, I will say thio*   re meant this as r. reality, andnot in any way to be whittled down by phraseology,,     Mr. TLOMAS:   That will do.     Mr, BONAR LA&apos;&quot;:   That was our intention and it will becarried out by the Government,   Now as regards the  shopmen*I do not see that I can say anything about that,,   It is notour fault.   If T.-ou could come hero and speak, or  come with others and sneak, for those in that position, the Governmentwould be only too willing to have direct negotiations withthem, but I think there are something like 40 to 50  differentUnions, and if we were to attemot to define  the position inwhich the shopmen would be in our negotiations with you,there is evry likelihood, that there  would bo deputationsfrom other Unions say we  the&quot; would have ---othin : to  do with It.   &quot;Vcannot doal with the c-^se 0  the  shopmen with you alone.   If you can come to any arranromcnt by which  YOUcon soeak for everybody, th-r we -ill be rcadv to no-otiate.                            -14-
               r.&apos;Tw THOiiAS:.  Afloat you mean by that is that if thev;hole of the Unions or a majority of the Unions could come to-gether with a united proposal for the shopmen, the Governmentwould consider that ?               MR. BOIIAR LAV:   Host decidedly.                                         my               MR. THO,AS;  It is no good/arguing about that, because i have talked myself hoarse with Sir Albert Stanley, and he hastalked himself worse, I think, against me on it, but at all eventsthat does not answer this point:  How can we go back to these menand say &quot;Yes, but here is the friction of the Unions&quot;?  But surelythe Government ought to be in a position to say &quot;Never mind thosedifficulties, those domestic difficulties,  which you must settle foryourselves&quot; - you have said that to us, but you do not even say &quot;Yes,but the Government Intend - never mind the differences between theUnions - to be as fair in stabilising the wages of shopmen as they arethe others,&quot; if the Unions could agree to come and work out the details and meet you.  I may as well admit that what our men feel Is that youare merely taking advantage, to put it quite fairly and bluntly, ofwhat I call these domestic differences in order to benefit yourselves.               SIR ROBERT HORNE:  Cur difficulty. Lir, Thomas, is this. -In nry position as Minister of Labour you can see what I have in my mind.is an avalanche of Unions all over the country in which the conditionsare not the same as in yours.  You follow that ?               !.R. THO AS:  Yesp  For the moment I am asking you tohelp me out of my difficulty,  I have said all I want to say on that, .but where is your difficulty ?  You surely do net suggest that if yousay to us here now &quot;Never mind your differences, never mind your domes-tic difficulties, come together and we will meet you1&apos;, that is one thing,But surely you ought not to take the advantage, because we are notunited, of not saying &quot;Ho, the Government * s intention is clear and definite, that just as they are prepared to stabilise wages till thetime the general revision has to take place at tho end of the year,
so that is our intention with regard-to the shopmen&quot;.  A meredifference between us and the Crafte-4JnloriS.^ou^you saying that.              &apos; MR. BONAR LAV:  I do not think that is possible,Mr. Thomas.-  As I understand the position, the shopmen in yourUnion are vorkIng in precisely the same conditions as the menin the A.S.E., for Instance.               MR. THOiAS:  Yes.               MR. BONAR LAW:  We could not possibly come toan arrangement with people in that form- of industry - becausethey are railwey workers - which is not the same as the arrange-ment with the people who are doing the same work in the sameshops side by side with you, and who may find as the year goes on that they are possibly goin1  to get something better thanyour people are getting.  In all our negotiations we never havemade the same arrangements for tho shopmen.               SIR R, HORNE:  You have put a strong plea forward on the ground that-the  railway men have been underpaid  in thepast,  Ycu cannot say the conditions of your shopmen have beendifferent from those of the engineers all  over the country,because they have always been regularly given the  same  terms as the A..S.E. has got for their members,              - MR. THOMAS:  That is not true. Sir Robert,  Thatis the difficulty the railway companies have got  themselves  into.Up to the war tho railway companies said  when an  application wasmade  for  the  district rate, as  explained  by  Mr, Bonar  Law, &quot;Ohno, railway shopmen  and the  crafts are not in the  same class  asthe outside Industry, they have got privilege tickets,  regular employment, free  passes&quot;  and all the  other things  were trottedout,  and  they said that is  the  justification for  not  paying  thedistrict  rate.  .Up to 19? 6  I -myself conducted I do not know  how            any  amount  of urbn tratipupmany  arbitrations/in order  to force the railway companies  to                             -16-
 accept what was then called the Committee on-Production1s Award.  Ultimately, they did accept it, but you see it is too late.  Up to then the railway shop conditions wore scandalous, This is not arguing on the merits for the moment; I am trying to put into your mind this clear fact that, never mind the abstract difficulties of the Ministry of Labour, or the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the President of the Board of Trade, here are men that merely say &quot;Yes, we arc recognised in your Union, but there is not even any guarantee for us similar to that given to the. others&quot;,  I gather that Mr, Bonar Law says this, &apos;JYes, but we cannot do that because it may be depriving them of something that they will get ultimately if the engineering award ;rives it&quot;.  Do I interpret that to mean that your only objection on this particular point that I am dealing with is because you are afraid that a guarantee rill worsen them ?                1.1R. BONAR L/w. :  No,  Let me try to put before you the difficulty as I see it.  Of course it is obvious if you can go back to that section of your Union and. say to them that the Government guarantee that they will not be. reduced, leaving them any possibilities of whatever may be arranged,. that they \ ould like that.  Obviously anyone would like an option and know- that they cannot go down.  But is it not per- perfectly certain that we cannot give that guarantee to shopmen and to skilled workmen who are doing the same work as the A.S.E., without simultaneously giving it to everyone else in that kind of trade ?                HP. THOi&apos;AS:  Yes, but you say that these men are nominally Government employees,  I merely say to you. when you recognise the principle that there is no intention whatever of interfering - ith the existing rates, surely it is not too much to say &quot;No, so far as the Government are concerned they arc not desirous of interfering and have no intention Of doing  so&quot;,                           -17-
               1.R, BONAR LAW;  I assure you that If there was any possibility of meeting you we should like to do it.  let me put this to you-  Supposing the time comes that there is astrike, or something of that kind, between the A.S..E. and theemployers.  Remember there is this vital difference, that sofar as the railway men are concerned their employers are theState, and that in regard to all those other people the employers are private individuals.  I cannot possibly, as I see It, givea guarantee that there should be no reduction under any cireum-stances to the shopmen who are working on the railways, without being immediately pressed to give the some guarantee to men whoare not employed by the. State at all j* to the engineers whoseemployers are not the Government but private individuals.  Ishould like to put this as a way out, as it seems to me.  YourBhopmen are not going to be put in any worse position by this.The negotiations have always been, as regards hours; the 12-V&apos;,                                         I                  iand everything ola-that kind, on a different, basis for the shopmenon the railways,  If there should be an attempt to lower thewages and make changes in the A.S.E. or the other people engagedin a similar trade, then would not your people  come and say tous &quot;But our employers are CDo Government; all other employers ofthe Government are getting their wages stabilised; we want you to find out some method of doing  it for us&quot;.  Would not that bethe time to raise the point and not now ?              &apos; LR, THO. AS:  You would then meet us by  saying, as you say now, &quot;Oh, but wo cannot negotiate with  you, because ofthe other people&quot;.               MR. BONAR LAV/:  That Is true,,               LIE. THOrAS:  Do I  interpret what you5-say to moanthis,  that those  shopmen are,  and are to be, made a part of andgoverned by tho conditions of the engineering and allied trades  ?               .-JR, BONAR LA1;:  I  understand that is  a  fact now,is it  not  ?                      ,                              *-18**
     Mr. THOMAS:   Yes, and that is what you intend      Sir ROBERT HORN)--:   They :,.ot the 12--;, ,  but the ordinaryrailwaymen did not get It.     Sir ALBERT STANLEY: ,  They do not get the district rates.     Mr. THOMAS;   There vre are I     Sir ALB7RT STANLEY:   Let me put this to you.   &quot;hat youare doing in negotiating the merits of a demand on behalf ofthe shopmen.   Surely that is not the issue, is it?   Thewhole point is to try to find a way whereby we can secure peace;that is all.   Your suggestion is that you desire some arrange-ments made to cover men employed in the railway shops *- we donot know who they are - whom you represent.   On the otherhand, wo have been warned by the Association of Railway Shopmen,representing the Craftsmens Union, that we must not make any settlement with this Union on behalf of the railway shoomen.See what is our position.   You quite understand it.   any settlement made here on bohalf of the shopmen is not a settle- -ment because/^ne other unions come along and say &quot;But werepresent these men, not the N.U.R, alone&quot;.   ,,Te have had this difficulty all the time.   I do suggest that it is for you tosuggest a solution and not for us, because we cannot force one.     Mr. THOMAS:   But look here, Sir, I hope you will notthink I am merely finessing.     Mr, BONAR LAW:   I understand,     Mr. THOMAS:   I am trying to see whether any solution canbe found of this difficulty.   In One of our offers, I forgetwhich it is, but I think it is in the management part, theprovision is made for a Joint Committee to  go into all thesequestions, that is to say, so many from, the Railway Pxecutiveand so many from us*-
     Sir iiLBPRT STANLEYj    Do you mean the present ne\negotiations?     Mr. THOMAS^   YesA   The Committee was settled to go into thedetails to he covered.   That would be associating ourselves andthe people from that side.   That Committee is to deal with all those within.the Conciliation &quot;grades, all those who for the momentare not shopmen.- I will put it in&apos; that way,   that is the difficultyof the Government saying !Te also set up and invite a similar bodyfrom the Crafts Unions and ourselves to deal with the shopmen1&apos;?     Mr. BONAR LA     Is not that really making the positionImpossible for you to help us, or for us to help you?   Prom thevery beginning of any discussions with the railways, the fact ofthe entire difference in conditions and everything else with regardto the shopmen, and the fact that terms are made the subject ofwhich they get the benefit - of union- you know - have made itimpossible for us to negotiate terms on their behalf with yourUnlonj  and to suggest that we should have some conference with theshopmen themselves in the railways and that we should invite them,is courting trouble^     Mr. THOMAS;   I  do not think so.   See what I mean.   sir robert Horns has a dozen times within the last few weeks, on hisown responsibility as the Minister of Labour,  convened people tcmeet him to  deal with the difficulty..   Let the Government say -and this comes under your Department primarily -     Sir ROBPRT HORNF;   Yes.     Mr, THOMAS;   Let Sir Robert Home, on behalf of the Governmentsay that there is this difficulty with the railway shopmen, theGovernment are anxious to find some means of adjusting It,   Theyrefuse, as I gather,  to be the arbiter of  what you call a domesticquarrel between us,, and merely settle with us  and have a row withsomebody else.   That is how I boil  down whwt you have&apos; said  to usthis morning,   Surely there ought to be some means by1 hich theGoverrmiont could convene a Conference of the two to deal with  the shop position.   If nothing  comes out of it we would be no  rorse offthan we are  now, but  something may come out of it,                               *   *                               -80-
MR.&amp;ONAR LAW: I do not like to turn down anything on whichthere is a chance at agreeing, but your national programme has not been a question of wages but of hours.The grievance of the shopmen is not your grievance.Do they get the same hours?     SIR ROBERT HORNE.   47 hours.     MR,B.CNAR LAW.   Quite a different set of hoursfrom yourso     MR. THOMAS.   It shows how keenly we feel - I not do/want to burke.it.  We are sCking for anotherhour to be put on them.  You know it, and Sir albert stanley rubbed it in fairly well,a-d it is perfectlytrue.  But it only shows the price they are preparedto pay.     ,MR. BONAR LAW.  Do you really suggest we are?g^ing to help peace by initiating a discussion onbehalf of the Government on a suggestion that an hourshould be added to their working week?     MS. THOMAS.  No.  I do not think that need come in.   What I do thinkani really believe would happenwould be this.  The Government are compelled to adoptthe Whitley Report.  You are morally bound to adoptit, and what I say i3 no more than is contained in the whitley Report.  If there is no initiative-from one side, the employer is morally bocad, by the Government&apos;sown declaration in favour of it, to conve:ie WhitleyCouncils.     SIR ROBERT HCRNE.  I will be absolutely frankabout the whole thing.  If I could see that yoursuggestion afforded a way out I would be willing toadopt it at once.  At the present time the way in whichthe Whitley scheme is working out is by industrial councils in particular industries.  The engineers arean industry regarded at present as separable from the
railway workers.  Therefore you get the IndustrialCouncil composed of the engineering trade as a whole,rather than going into any particular division of therailway workers, and saying &quot;We will take railway shopmenas one industry&quot;.  It may be a solution you have afforded by what you suggest, but on the other hand I can seethere will be some opposition from the.outside engineerswho at present hold a large number of these people as members of their Unions.     MR. CRAMP.  The railways are an industry.     SIR ROBERT HORNE.  That is the whole conflictgoing on in the labour world to-day.     MR. THOMAS.  But you have convened Conferences.     SIR ROBERT HORNE.   Yes.     MR. THOMAS.   And you convened a conference withthe Railway Executive^ the Engineers and the Ship-bull.aing Trade Unions on a claim for 15/- a week-St far as I understand the maximum you can give is this.     MR. bonar  LAW.   May I Interrupt you.Excuse me if J do not follow clearly.  On principle Iean see no objection whatever to doing this, but Is notthis the point, that a large number of the men for ^amyou are speaking are members not of your Union but ofthe A.S.E. and other engineering trades.  Supposingwe agreed something with you,, would not we.have the others at our throats at once for interfering withsomething which did not concern us.  The thing vavldnot be settled simply by a refusal to go into it.  Theywould be very angry with us for Interfering with some-thing vhich did not concern us.     MR. THOMAS.  Is this your final word upon that point - I know of no other way cf suggesting it - thatyou say to us, no matter ?hat happens you cannot settle
- 83 -113with, ua to create  (1 am on the shopmen now) anotherdifficulty with another section who may repudiate any settlement made, but you do invite us to come forward as a united body with a demand either for the futureregulation of railways shopmen&apos;s conditions or themachinery that will govern it.     MR. BONAR LAW *   Certainly.     MR. THOMAS.     That is what you say.?     MR. BONAR LAW.     Yes.     MR. THOMAS..   I do not think I need waste anymore time in arguing it than I have.     I have dealt with a few points, but there may be many others to be dealt with.   With regard to the question cfstandardisation, of which Sir Albert Stanley willknow, I will give you an illustration.   Can you conceiveof any satisfaction if a goods worker in Liverpoolworks for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and gets28/- a week; a goods worker In Liverpool doing precisely the same work, near the same dock, working for the NorthV/estern, gets 29/- a week; a goods worker in Liverpool,working for the Cheshire lines, gets 5c/- a week, and a goodsworker for the Midland gets 27/- and so on?     You cannot have satisfaction in those conditionso     MR. BONAR LA;..   Does not the offer we have made youdeal with that to a large extent?;.     SIR ROBERT HORNE.   I thought we met that pointMr. Thomas..     MR. BONAR I AW.&apos;   I thought so too.   I really do not know what the difficulty is about that,   I mentioned in theHouse of Commons that in addition to stabilising thewages, we agreed that the standardisation was one of the
things we accepted in principle.     Mr. THOMAS:   The language of the offer - It has been thesubject of questions by my friends here and in our negotiations -they will remember the question raised last night on this verypoint - does imply, and the suggestion is made, that the Government,even with&apos;the intention of standardisation, will take off the war wage,   Eo I gather from &quot;hat you say new - I did not hear what you said in the House of Commons - that your definition of the Committeeis that they have now to go int&apos;  the question of standardisationand agree next week, or the &quot;week after, on a. standard rate rightthroughout?   If that means an increase, plus the war wage, it willbo given;  If It means reduction so far as including the war wage,it rill not be takon off..     Sir ALBwRT STANLEY-::   &quot;&quot;hat do you mean;  not taken off what?It will not be taken off the total.     Mr. THOMAS:   In December, when we come to review this programme the position -ill bo then reviewed not on the cost of living buton the whole of the circumstances then with the standardisation basis.     Mr. BONAR LA&apos;&quot;:   I will tell you what I understand was theposition as to that,   As regards standardisation, we hav-&apos;i acceptedthe principle of whvt you put forward:  that is to say, that such acase as you have given of a man in Liverpool doing the same work should not be paid a different wage because he Is employed by adifferent railway.   That is the principle we- agreed in tho Cabinet.It is only a question of interpretation.   There again, I suppose,that affects the other Union with which we are in negotiation.As regards the other point - the stabilising of wages - what wehave undertaken is that until the end of the year there shall beno reduction.   At the end of the year you will be perfectly free to come to us and ask for an increase, If you like, and we will be equally free, if circumstances make it impossible, to say that wages are too high In tho present conditions, and re-open it,&apos;7e shall be as free to deal with it as we are to-day,
     Mr. THOMAS:   That is a very clear answer on wart 1,   Youranswer on standardisation Is that the standardisation Is clear and definite, that if the agreed standard means more than the combinedpresent war wage and existing wage on the basic rate, that willbe immediately operative?     Mr. BONAR LA&quot;:   Certainly;  that is clear.   &quot;  Sir ALBERT STANLEY:   On the other hand wc also undertake thatthere shall be no reduction in the total wages of any man duringtho period, although we may take something off his war wage and put It on to the standard wage-.   There may be an increase to some.     Mr. BONAR LATTj   I hooe I have made that plain.   You gave an illustration of men in Liverpool getting different rates for doing the same work. .  The standardisation which we agreed to is that thatsort of -thing should bo put an end to, and that in a district thew?ges should be the same irrespective of the railway for whichthe man is working.   Is that clear?     Mr. THOMAS:   Yes, I understand that.     Mr. ROBERT V7ILMAMS:.   Sir Albert Stanley has put the point that standardisation may add to the basic wage, and that somethingmay be taken off from the war w^ge.   I suggest that that hypothet-ical consideration should be left out, because that would raisethe whole bone of contention which was raised so strongly last night.Any discussion on decreasing the rrr was-e would do that.     Sir ALB1MT STANLEY:   But it does not decrease the total amount.     Mr. THOMAS.   It is not that at all.   That is not the pointinvolved, because there is no transference in any case.   Thatwas agreed before, namely, that we merely engaged to find a standard rate and then I understand when no negotiations in Decembertake ^lace, instead of negotiating on 28 different rates we shallno otiate on one standard rate.
     Sir ..LBFRT STANLEY;   In the meantime, these new standardrates will come into force, and at once.   The standard rates &quot;illbe put into force so that when you come to tho end of the yearand you then desire to negotiate again you will have ; ot the stan-dard rates to work upon throughout the country,   That greatlysimplifies the problem compared with to-day, which is the mostcomplex thing one could imagine.     Lr. BONAR LAW:   I think that is all re can say.     Mr. CRAMP:   May I say that there is a great fear among themen on the most highly rated!railways that standardisationmight mean bringing other . down to a mean as between the two points,and thereby reduce their wages on standardisation.   That makes it more difficult to get things accepted.     Mr. BONAR LAW:   That is not involved in anything we are doing now.     Mr. CRAMP:   I understand that standardisation does not raiseeveryone to the highest maximum now obtaining.     Mr. B01TAR LATTr   It does this in this agreement, that nobodywill be worse off during the period than he is to-day.   Some willbe better off.   if the time comes to fight about wages and you have the principle of standardisation, It may have th? result of bringing everyonefs wages down, whereas in other conditions itwould not.   That surely is to the advantage of the trade as awhole, but it do^s not arise now in any case.     Sir ROBERT HORN?:   Tfe are not likely to fix standard rates which will be much worse.     Mr, THOMAS:   You can offer a standard rate, but                                -26-
it is for us to say whether we accept that standard rate.               ivlR.  CRAi,P:  That is the difficulty to-day withour men.               SIR ROBERT HORNS:  I think you- have had enoughexperience to know.               MR.  BONAR LAW:  When we were discussing in theCabinet the question of equalisation somebody said, and everybody                       O. Ifagreed, of course,  that/mea?it there muse bo equalisation upwards.               MR.  THOMAS:  Whet they were thinking of wrs what happened in the Cabinet.  &apos; If you attempt to equalise, it has beenin an upward direction and never in a downward direction,               MR.  BONAR LAI:  When I spy that happened in theCabinet it does not mean I agree with it in all circumstances,but it does mean that we at once recognise that -if we accepted that principle at all on the present conditions it would mean more money.  I do not know whether it is worth while speakSSg to youupon the general position.  I think you understand it as well as Ido, and I think you as anxious as I am, taking you as a whole, toavoid a strike.  I think I might perhaps say a word&apos; or two about thegeneral position of your Union,  You will yourselves recognise ----               MR.  THO.AS:  Do not start threatening!               MR. BONAR LAW:  It depends  what you mean by a threat,I am not sorry you have mentioned that,  I did not mean to refer toit, but I will.  I think you are perfectly right in saying thatrailwymen are not to bo kept in a worse position than men of otnerindustries, and that thoy should not get the benefit of the improve-ments you are trying to  secure all round because at the present ratesthe railways are losing.  I  think you are right in that.  It  is an impossible position if the railways cannot raise the price of whatthey soli when everybody else is raising the price of what is sold toother people  Nobody knows  better than you do that there is  a limit to what can be done on the railways by raising the rates.  It is notmerely, to put it in the worst form, that excessively high rates willinterfere with all our trrde competing with foreign countries.  I thinl
                     - 28 -it goes further than that.   Experience  always  chowsthat, when you get beyond a  certain point,  increasing the  ratesdoes not increase the revenue:   the total falls off.There is a point beyond which,  apart altogether.fromother considerations, increasing the rates does, not increasethe revenue.   I cannot believe that a situation like    present, where the railways are costing the taxpayertoday something rather more  than half the total expenditureof the country before the war,  is a condition which can be permanent.   whether nationalized or not,the railwaysought to be self supporting.   Supposing one looks atit from the crudest point of view, from the point of  viewof those who say that in taking them over there should beconfiscation;  that is to say,  pay no interest at all on railway shares.   Still there will be an enormous deficit,that is a very serious, thing. .   I do not wish to exaggeratethe financial position, because the last thing I ought to dois to damage our trade;  but you will probably see whatthe Government have had to do this week in regard to  theAmerican Exchange.   That, is only an indication of the position do not wish to exaggerate, but the financial position is serious.   If we go on in our effort to improve the conditionof the people of this country and incur in every directionincreased expenditure, I do not know what the end  of it willbe.   Luring the war, of course, it was all very simple.  r Viecould borrow all the money we wanted;- and as long as youborrow money there seems to be an endless supply of capitalavailable for anything.   But the serious crux will&apos; come when we can no longer borrow money.   The amount we have to borrow during this year while demobilisation is going onIs serious.   I only say that to point out to you that whenthe  Government decided to guarantee the present rates of wagesuntil the end of the year  ; all wages - they will haveto add a  considerable amount.   They have/iot  been ableto tell us how bitg it is,   /These concessions mean..
 Those concessions, mean a large, anrunt , her large re do not exactly know.. It is true that thrse whom many of you regard as your enemies.,&apos; the capitalists-, and the employers. ton.&apos;,  all wish tn improve the  conditions after the war, and not merely to have anything like the old position. That  is the one thing that justifies us in incurring this additional expenditure.  When we did that, there was, as you know., the possibility of an immediate strike, that is to  say it was to take place -today-.   I do not say it. is not there now.     MR.  THOMAS:  It .1s there.     MR.  BONAR LAW:   But. I hope it is not quite the same-.     MR.  THOMAS:  It is there at any rate.     MR.  BONAR LAW::  , The. Government  in a case like this; cannot help you.  We are going to make an offer wMc-h la generousx  You have to put it to your people and say we have? done  the utmost we -can with regard, to this, off cur.     That Is all I want to say about it.  I have not dealt with the ccal-miners because I understand that Mr *  Smillie Is ccming to see me this afternoon.-  In both these cases we have spent not only a great deal of time, but  we have had a great deal of anxiety in agreeing to this  expenditure of public money.  We think it is the utmost the  State can do., and we hope that, in spite of the danger- -hich now exists, this strike will be avoided. (To  Mr.Smillie) As regards what you sold about threats, I am sorry that in addition to my being wicked, you thought. I was- foolish      ME., SMILLIE.  I did. not mention.your wickedness..      MB&apos;:. THOMAS.  He took that, for granted:      MR.. BONAR LAW.  We are talking in a, friendly way now.   That is a conundrum whether one would, rather be&apos; - considered a fool or a rogue. . I think It, would be difficult for  any of us torn swer t hat..  On the whole. I think I 3hould prefer to be considered a fool,
    Ac  regards  that matter,  lot me point out to you that nothin was further from my mind  than  saying anything that was a threat I  do not  profess to be  an expert in tho correct use of language but I think in  common usage  a&apos;  threat implies one&apos; of two things; either  you are  bullying the  people to whom you are talking, or you are saying  to  them,   &quot;If you do so-and-so, we, by way of punishment, will do scmethimg  else&quot;.   If anything like that Is the moaning of  a threat,  I certainly used no words which could.be considered as implying that.   It is rather difficult to put a  clear distinction,  what I did do, and I am. sure in your heart you  will agree with it, was this;   I was pointing out what  I believed the inevitable consequences would be. Under any circumstances,  with  a body like years, a strike would be  the most  serious thing that could, be imagined.  But a  strike  when the  State itself Is the employer is an entirely different thing.   It is  a new set of conditions that the  , people  in this  country-have  never had.   Ivmust say I would do it again  if I wore making tho  speech, for it&apos; was deliberately done    it was an endeavour to point out, not to you, Gentlemen, for  you thoroughly  understand it   but to everyone who is  concerned,  what  the consequences of a  strike under these  conditions  could  be,  I-do not  in the least suggest that it ,would be  an  easy
 task for the Government to deal with it, but I do say  that a strike in these conditions is.different from anything that has over happened in this country, and surely it ..ould have been wrong of me, speaking for the Government on the eve, as I feared, of this great calamity not to put forward what I believed would be the inevitable consequences of it.   It is serious.   You will forgive me arguing this Mr. Smillie, I have no doubt if you feel inclined, you can put the other side with equal force.   To me the seriousness of it lies in this.   Tnat would happen supposing you won in a case of that kinds   It would be a splendid thing for those who wished to upset the decision of these matters by constitutional means.   If the other method had succeeded, then Parliamentary Government would be impossible.   It is for that reason, and for that reason alone, that I do wieh in all earnestness to impress upon you that the Government have done every- thing they can;   and this at least Is certain, that a strike in these conditions would be a  more serious thing than any strike that has ever taken place In this country.   The Government would have been criminal if they had not done everything they could to avoid It. I thinl^we have done all, and I am sure you  eel your responsibility as much as we do, and that you will come to the conclusion that you would be equally criminal if you did not do everything you could to prevent it.. I should only like to say this.   Unless something like a League of Nations can be made effective,.and it willbe a very sad reVult of the war if it cannot,.unless something can be made effective and. you have a system of different states armed to the teeth, even from the  - point of view of those who wish to use their power to
get the most for the Nation, their chance of getting itwill be not by fighting, but by hav ing the power andnot using it.   In the same way we have experienced in recent years that the strength of Labour1 is inthe knowledge they have of how strong they are, andthe employer sorrow how strong they are.   They will getfar more by using that power in negotiations, and theywould run a great risk in a big strike like this of breaking the very machine by means of which they have got concessions up to now.     MR. THOMAS.   You have said one or two  things that require an answer.   Our presence here is the bestanswer to our view of the gravity of the situation.If we did not realise it,  f we did not try to avertit, we T/ould not be here and we would have said toOur people &quot;You have come to your decision, take theplunge&quot;.   That is the best answer.   You have said inthe House of Commons when you were Chancellor of theExchequer, and I have repeatedly pointed out, that Iknew we were living on borrowed capital and I knew what would inevitably result from it, but therevelations in tho Coal Enquiry and our everyday exper-ience rather tend to show that the Government might,with profit to themselves and with a view to easing1thesituation, make some enquiries with regard to theprofiteering that existed during the war.  (Hoar hear).That is the kind of feeling the workers havo.   I donot want to labour it except to say this.   You have said frankly that you do not intend a threat, and of                                          icourse vie accept that.   The unfortunate thing is thatsome of the young bloods behind you evidently thoughtit was a throat.     MR. BONAR LAI&apos;.   I cannot help that.
     MR, THOMAS.  I agree.  Fe know the-conditionsof labour; we know what labour suffers; and we know the feelings of our men when we are here.  These people who do not know their life as we know it, merely jeerat what they believe is bluff/ and it irritates thesituation..  That is&apos;all I have to say, and we willconvey.our decision later.     MR;. SMILLIS,.  I did not wish to intervene,but I should&apos;like ty&quot;sdy-a wfcp.&quot;t.  With regard to thestatement I made; I did not for a moment feel you were either.a fool or a rrgue.  I can assure you of that.None of us has airy desire to provoke a strike for thepurpose of upsetting industry in this country.  it requires stability rather than chaos if we are to goon.  We wore engaged at the time really in most delicatenegotiations.  Delegates vere&apos;called from all parts ofthe country and we had to put before them the Government. * soffer, and I felt that that was the very&apos;worst time for anything to be said that could be oonstrued into the shape of a threat.     Not that It concerns me very much, because I am oldenough now not to-&quot;allow myself to be upset by that,  but our delegates were rather different, and I believe that statement you .made in the House of Commons TO uld have made an enormous difference if we had been on the point of asettlement..-.  Whatever your own views on the matter maybe, I feel that, there is   no doubt at all as to vhatView the capitalists in. the House of Commons took of it.They could see before them armed forces shooting&apos; downtheyieh,  women and children of the working classes.     MR. BONAR LAW.    -I hope not,     MR, SMILLIE. - and finally wiping out any attempt.of the;workers to improve their condition.
     MR. B0U.8R LAW.  Will you let me interrupt you.I am perfectly certain that  I am not exaggerating when say that such a vie?.&apos; was not held-by even a fraction of the present House of Commons.     MR. SMILLIE.   I do not think,we need argue It.     MR. BONAR LAW,  You were not present;  I wasand I think I can judge the  feeling a little.&quot; I havehad a long expedience of a good many people sitting inthe House of Commons.- but I do not think that is thepoint.  We are really all anxious far a settlement ofthe great trouble which at the present time is overthe country, and none of us  will necessarily provoke a stoppage of *ork,  I feel  sure.  We shall have anopportunity of meeting you this- afternnon and I need not deal with anything  of that kind now, but Ithink your  c-nversa&amp;ion with Mr0 Thomas today fullyproves that you at least are doing your best to find away out of the pr esent deadlock, and I thank you verymuch for meeting us so courteously this morning.-34**
