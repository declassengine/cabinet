SinDocument la the Property ofSECRET  SERVICE  COMMITTEE. (Minutes  of Third Meeting). A 4/fr&quot;c.U     J^TT^^vJxThe Secret Service  Committee  as reconstituted by the Tvar Cabinet            (Minutes 550A of the 24th Maroh)  held a meeting at the Foreign Office on            Friday, 4th April,  at 3.30.    Lord  Curzon  presided, and the other members            of the Committee present  were  Mr. Shtrtt and Mr. Fisher.   There were also            in attendance Mr.  Basil Thomson,  C.B., Mr.  Stephen Gaselee, C.B.E.,  of the            Foreign Office,  and Mr. S.W. Harris, C.B.,  C.V.O., of the Home Office            (Secretary). Organization       The Committee had before them a memorandum circulated by the Home Intelligence Secretary which outlined  two alternative schemes for the establishment      &apos;nt&quot;   of the new Department of  Intelligence authorized by the V/ar Cabinet.         Ij   The Committee decided to  adopt Soheme A.Ipropoganda.         Lord Curzon informed the Committee that the Foreign Office had decided            to form a News Department which Sir William Tyrrell would control.   The            object of the News  Department, to which is  affiliated the Political            Intelligence Department,  is to collect and  focus all material from Foreign            Countries, and to conduct propaganda  in Foreign Countries.   Sir William            Tyrrell would be in personal contact with  the Secretary of State from whom            he would obtain directions as  to  pelicy.    It was desirable that he should            be in close touch with Mr. Thomson.                  As regards propaganda in this country Mr. Thomson informed the            committee proposed of private organizations  which had been formed to counteract            the spread of Bolshevist  ideas.   The Committee thought that Mr. Thomson            ought to have a suitable  man under  his control who would organize propaganda            and keep in touch with these private  efforts provided they are not in any            degree of a political character.    The person selected might be an exper-            experienced journalist nor need he  be  debarred  from contributing to the Press            himself.   He would not require a large staff and it was not desirable that            he sh*uld be located in the Home  Office or  at Scotland Yard.   If a            journalist were selected, Fleet Street would be a convenient  place for him            to have^an office.    The man appointed  should be responsible under Mr.            Thomson for all propaganda such as  newspaper articles, organization of            speakers, etc.   The Foreign Office would  be able to assist by the supply            sf material. Press.            Mr. Fisher suggested that it  would be useful  if   conferences could b            arranged from time to time with representatives of the Press to give them            information and guidance  on social  unrest  and similar matters.   Lord            Curzon explained that such a plan was  being adopted by the Foreign Office            in regard to Foreign Affairs,  and the  duty of meeting the Press would            probably&apos; be undertaken by the  Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.   The            Committee were of opinion that a  similar duty as regards  Home Affairs            might be devolved upon the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the            Home Department.
