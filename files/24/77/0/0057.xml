J7D56inl A R  C i B II El,;AGRICULTURAL  LABOUR.Memorandum by the secretary for 00 ot land.      1.    The War Office have,intimated that it is proposed to recall to military duty TJO weoka hence the soldiers belong- ing to the Agricultural Companies who, are now engaged on the land,    The number, of men so engaged in -Scotland is about 4,000.   -They/Am. re originally drawn from various occupations, but they have now had considerable training in agricultro. Their  withdrawal:.at tho present&apos; juncture would have ouch serious.effects  -upon agriculture that I feel bound to ask for reconsideration  of the matter,     2,     The great shortage of agricultural labour which existed  in Scotland before and at the Armistice has not yet been made good in spite, of the demobilisation of considerable numbers  of men,     -        On the other hand labour is urgently required in .&quot; order  to  maintain the increased afoa of cultivation end to clean  the land v/hich has necessarily been somewhat neglected in recent years.    The .- card of Agriculture for Scotland have,  in  fact/ just proposed to me that further measures should be taken  tO&apos; secure the release from the  Army of agri- culturistB who are not&apos;demobiiisable under the  existing Orders,.I am examining this protosal further.     4.      In the ma.anwhlle,  I wish to point out that the withdrawal from  the land of&apos;tho soldiers belonging to the Agricultural Companies at-tho ti..ie when spring work is at its height would be  most injurious, to agriculture.     I suggest that any  such withdrawal should be postponed for at least two   - months to&apos; enable  the spring work to be completed,(&quot;Signed)  ROBERT IOTKO,lattish Office,  Whit ehall.     29th inarch,  1919.C R lu fJ
