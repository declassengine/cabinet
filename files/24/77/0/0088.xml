I circulate to the Cabinet the following  memorandum written by General Haking, our&apos;chief military delegate at Spa.   Sth April, 1919.                                WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.       V\\      THE  DEFEAT  OF  BOLSHEVISM.             Mi036      J                                                                  4602    &amp; The demoralized condition of the inhabitants of Europe and other parts of theworld may be traced to two main causes :     1st.  The neglect of Governments before the war to recognize the due rights of the         working man, who was producing the wealth  of the world, and who&apos;was not         given a sufficient share in its enjoyment.    2nd. The war weariness produced  by four and a half years of incessant strife of a         most deadly nature, and the consequent decrease in the value set upon human         life by one individual with reference to another.    2. This has resulted in every man who  finds life going hard  with him  askinghimself the question why the conditions should not be changed.  This is the first germof Bolshevism, and, in every country,  it finds suitable soil  in which to flourish andspread itself with alarming speed.  It affects the individual  in the first  instance, andthrives mainly on self-interest.   The individual who suffers from it knows no patriotism,love of country, or regard for other people, though he pretends that he possesses all.these  qualities, and that  his main  object is to  establish  a  system of fraternity andequality.    3. In order to gain his ends, he seizes rapidly upon existing organizations of fellow-workers, whether they belong to his own country or not.  His  politics are international and he will hail as a brother anyone, of any class, criminal or otherwise, belonging  toany country, who will  assist  him  in  his task  of breaking down the previous  fabric  ofcivilization, whilst he is not the least concerned in building up anything  in its place.    4. If he succeeds  in seizing the reins  of Government, as he had  done in Russia,economic life comes to an end.   It is not only the  rich landowners, the  merchants andthe official and  professional classes who suffer ;  the- bourgeois,  the  poor  and the bolshevists themselves are almost equally involved  in misery, murder and  anarchy.This is so much the case that, after intense suffering, Bolshevism kills itself. Meanwhile,it has ruined the country, and long years of  depression must follow before the laboureror any other member of fie community can live in comfort.    5. During the last four  and a half years we have  been  so closely  associated with war between well-defined Governments  that  the victorious Governments naturally look upon their late enemies as the greatest  danger to the future  peace of the world ; and,whilst preparing the terms of peace that are to be offered to  the defeated states, theyare doing  their utmost  to  still further break down  the  stability of the  defeatedGovernments and. their inhabitants.   The Allies do not appear to consider that there is any serious danger of  Bolshevism spreading  to their own countries, or that any serioussteps need be taken to prevent its increase before it is too late.  They are still rangingthemselves together against a danger that is past, in  the effort, not only to  secure a lasting peace with the  enemies against whom they have been fighting, but also to reducethe political, economic and commercial stability of those enemies.   They do not  appearto recognize that one war is over,&apos; and that they must at once get busy to prepare to actvictoriously against the next;   which means that they must rearrange their  formerforces and create an alliance with any people, in or out of Europe,  who  are prepared  tojoin hands with them to defeat  the international power of Bolshevism.    6. It is quite apparent that Germany is at present engaged in a  great struggle against Bolshevism, the Bolshevist boiler is being heated up daily, it has  no safety valve,and unless s mething is done immediately to relieve the pressure it  will  soon burst, andwill destroy any  Government in Germany which can have the power of carrying outterms of peace or of maintaining order within its borders.    7. The Armistice conditions have been imposed  upon Germany for such a lengthyperiod and with such severity  that no  nation except a very  powerful one could havestood ,the sirain so well,  as  Germany has done, and  now she is reaching the limit  ofher endurance.   I am convinced that  in order  to  save, not  only Germany,  but alsoFrance  and  England and later  on   America  from  Bolshevism,  the Allies  mustimmediately relax the conditions of the  Armistice and do this in no half-hearted way.

      8.  The politician, the financier, the merchant, the Army and the Navy, all  wantsafeguards.    Added to this each  separate  country forming  the  Alliance  wantssafeguards, not only against the Germans, but also against  each ether.   The demands for these safeguards involve lengthy conferences, they  create  considerable friction and they lead to inconclusive  decisions  and counter-decisions which  satisfy no one.Meanwhile the great storm clouds of Bolshevism are daily rolling  closer from East to west, and protection against this menace is being neglected.     9. If it  is accepted that Bolshevism  is an international  force,  which knows nocountry  and  can thrive in any, it is surely necessary for us to create  at  the earliestpossible moment an international force to repel it. Following certain instructions I havereceived  from time to time, I have been in a position to gauge not  only the feelings, ofthe Germans  towards  the various nations of the Allies, but also  the  feelings betweenthe Allies themselves.   I have discovered beyond any possibility of doubt that  thereare two  close friends  and two  deadly enemies amongst the nations who have  been engaged  in the recent  struggle.   The friends  are Great Britain and  America and theenemies are France and Germany.  It is easier in this world to destroy friendship thanenmity,  and  our efforts at present  should be  directed towards  cementing in every possible  way the existing  Anglo-Saxon  friendship, which constitutes the greatesteconomic and military power in the world, and not  attempt to  reduce  the  enmitybetween  France and  Germany.     10.  All questions involving friction between Great Britain and America should bedealt with in the most  open, straightforward manner; no diplomacy should be used, and both sides should lay down their cards, because both at the  present moment are  facedwith a very grave and  serious danger.   If the enmity of France for Germany preventsthe former from joining whole-heartedly in the  steps that must be, taken to meet this danger, she must be  left out of the calculation and told not to interfere.     11.  The first step  to be taken is to strengthen Germany in every possible  way sothat she can  tight  Bolshevism in her own country and  on her frontiers.   If this isnot done very shortly there will  be no Germany from whom to obtain the execution ofour terms of  Peace,  indemnities, &amp;c, and  no  Germany to trade  with.  Germany canonly be strengthened by giving her people  food  and work.   The Allies,  after the most dangerous delays, have commenced to supply food, but little has yet been done to providework for her inhabitants.   The limited raising of the blockade  which appears to becontemplated in the  near future will do more harm than  good,  because  the Germanpeople, who  look upon the complete  raising of the blockade as their only chance ofsalvation, will receive any  half-hearted measure with final  despair.  The completeraising of the blockade  would  also give us a very  powerful  offensive  weapon byre-applying it, if at any time during the further negotiations drastic action on our partbecame necessary. It is useless to raise the blockade partially in order to pass in and out certain manufactured goods.  What Germany wants is to  keep her inhabitants content by giving them work to do.  We can only give  them work by trading  freely with  themand thus enlisting them on our side against Bolshevism.   Germany wants raw material and other goods of many kinds to start her factories, and without these materials herpeople cannot work.  Germany wants raw materials just as much as she wants food if she is to  overcome Bolshevism, and she cannot overcome it without.     12.  If the Anglo-Saxon race would tell Germany to-morrow that the blockade is tobe completely removed in three days,  she would rise  from her present apathy anddespair, she would at once commence far more energetic measures than heretofore to defeat Bolshevism, and she would  raise a great bulwark against this terrible  evil toprotect Western Europe  and thus  restore a real peace to the world.   The blockade, Iam convinced, should be raised at once ; every one of the Allied nations would then beat liberty to trade with German3r, and if one nation gains an advantage over another,it will only be because  it possesses amongst its merchants certain individuals and  firmssympathetically  treated by their Government, who apply ability, initiative and deter-rnination beyond their fellows in  other countries.  Every Allied nation will thus  havethe same opportunity when starting in the race to profit by the trade with Germany,and the matter is far too urgent to wait until each Allied nation is sure  that it is goingto be better placed than its neighbour.                                    ^                                               (Signed)    E.  HAKING,                                                                  Lieut f General.   SPA,     &apos;61st March, 1919.
