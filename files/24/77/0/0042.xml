A,                                                  ic4cKd,L  lev.t..v making                                                                  6 01Intoxicating Liquor (Output &amp; Delivery) Order,..2917,Boer (Prices &amp; Description) Order, 1917Spirits (Prices &amp; Description) Order, 1918,7 oifiMEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER. (1) I desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the difficult- ies which I feel in connection with the administration of the above Orders by my Departments. (2) In view of the necessity for exercising the strictest economy in the use of cereals owing to the submarine mena^ce, steps were taken in the spring of 1917 to reduce the output of beer by the issue of the Intoxicating Liquor (Output &amp; Delivery) order this Order was issued by the Ministry of Food.  A further step was taken in October, 1917, when the Beer (Prices &amp; Description) Order was issued by the Ministry in order to prevent profiteering.  Similar restrictions on the output and prices of spirits were also subsequently enforced by Order.      These Orders, and the subsequent amending Orders, have been administered by the Ministry;of Pood,, (3) The necessity for the conservation of cereals no longer exists. The only reason for continuing the restrictions on output  is, as I understand it, the desire felt in some quarters that these restrictions should be used for the enforcement of temperance. (4) I submit, however, that this is not a matter for the Ministry of Food.   Under Section 4 of the New Ministries and Secretaries Act, the duty of the Pood Controller is limited to maintaining a proper supply of food and encouraging the production of food; and it therefore appears to me to be a matter of considerable doubt whether I am legally just- ifiod in maintaining restrictions for which the economic necessity has wholly disappeared.  Moreover, the services of the expert advisers who have assisted the Ministry in the administration of these: Orders will shortly be no longer available, and it appears to me undesirable to organise fresh staff in a Department which is being demobilised as rapidly as possible. (5) I may add that it has not been possible for me to bring into effect the policy of cheaper and better beer to which I pledged myself, first, owing to the requirements of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and secondly, owing to the fact that the Cabinet were unable to accept my proposals that the average gravity should be raised to the degree which I  consider desirable; and I am convinced that the prevalence of low gravity beer has increased the demand for spirits.  The Ministry of Pood is, however, held, by the public and the Press, to be responsible  for the continuance of the present restrictions, (6) Finally, I  -may point out that at present at least five separate departments are concerned in questions of liquor control - namely, the Home Office, the Treasury, the Customs and Excise Department,  the Liquor Control Board, and the Ministry of Food.  This multiplicity of depart- ments leads inevitably to delays and to fluctuations of policy, in a matter where it is essential to lay down a definite plan and to explain this to the public.  It will at least be a step in the right direction to cut out the Ministry of Food the ground for whose&apos; connection with the question has disappeared.  If it is necessary for  the existing orders to stand, they can do so, with clear notice that responsibility for administering them is vested in another department; a;j an interim measure the Ministry of Food can even, if desired, continue to make fresh orders at the request and on the responsibility of that other department, if the latter is not clothed with the necessary powers. (7) Having regard to all the circumstances, I desire strongly  to recom- mend to the Cabinet that the Ministry of Food should be relieved of all responsibility in respect of liquor  control, and its functions trans-I ferred to one or other of the departments mentioned above. MINISTRY OF FOOD.                             GEO. H. ROBERTS,
