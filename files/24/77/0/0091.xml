BALTIC.

The Esthonian Government are very desirous of obtaining the return from the Germans of the Lee-breaking tug HERCULES as they wish to use her to clear a way  in the Gulf of Riga in order that their destroyers may operate in rear of the Bolshevik  line. Admiral Goette was directed by A.N.A.C. on the 24th March that the vessels HERCULES, HAMBUHG, STINT, SUROP and OSTSEE were to be returned to the Esthonian Authorities at once, but he has asked upon which clause of the Armistice this demand was demand was based and has stated that the request must be refused.

Russian Naval experts in Finland state that on account of the Wild winter the Baltic ice will break up about the third week in April.

The Esthonian General Staff report that they have plenty of trained men in their reserve battalions, who, however, cannot be sent to the front owing to the absence of boots and clothing. A supply of boots is now on its way. to Reval.

BLACK SEA and DANUBE.

Odessa is being evacuated by the French on account of the impossibility of feeding the population.  The troops will be withdrawn after the evacuation of the civilian population which includes a Greek colony of about 30,000 people. British men-of-war have proceeded  to Odessa to render assistance. The Bolshevik communique of 29th March reports that Soviet troops have seized the whole of the Chongar Peninsula, which forms the eastern entrance to the Crimea. It is further, stated that important operations will be undertaken shortly against perekop, the western isthmus leading into the Crimea. H.M.S. 

"MARLBOKOUGH" has gone to Sevastopol.

The Allied Mission, has been withdrawn from Buda Pest to Belgrade. Captain Haggard reports that, mines have been laid below Buda Pest and Motor Launches fitted for mine Sweeping are being sent up the river.

The coal situation has become very acute, and it is impossible to reorganise river traffic until a supply is available. The Commander-in-Chief has ordered 400 tons a month to be supplied for the use of dredgers in deepening the Sulina Mouth, which has silted up badly. The reconstitution of the Danube Commission is an urgent necessity.
