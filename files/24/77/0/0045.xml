(Received 26th, 11 a.m.)    Secret.  Afghanistan.  My telegram of the 15th March.   British Agent, who isstill  at  Jalalabad,  reports 17th March that alarm  has  been  caused in  Kabul andJalalabad by news  of revolt of  the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Herat; thatKabul troops (? at) Jalalabad are showing signs of mutiny and  that regiments  of native cavalry are  again threatening.   Had Herat rumour been founded upon fact,we should almost certainly have heard of it through Meshed, and it is probably basedon fact that Governor and Commander-in-Chief both belong  to (? Musahib) family,now under arrest.   According  to Meshed reports, news  of Habibulla&apos;s death wasreceived quietly in Herat about  5th  March.  News  of Amanulla&apos;s succession, whichwe asked Meshed to send to Herat, should have reached Herat (? only) a few days ago.
