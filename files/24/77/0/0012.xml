e!tenrt for the week ended 18th Earch...1919.     PART I - FOOD. PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT.      The Weather and Condition, of Crops .           Heavy rain  fell  early  in the week,  causing floods cn the  low-lying land in the Northern Counties and  in  Somerset.   In Wales  there was a  continuous downpour, with  snowstorms  in some districts,  and thousands of acres are under water;   some cattle and a large  number  ef sheep have  been  swept  away.   There was an improvement  during  the latter half of the week however .   Some ploughing was  passible on  the dryer soils  and  a little  spring corn was sown, but  farm work is still  very much behindhand.           Where the land has not been  flooded winter corn and beans  look well.   Pastures are  improving  in the more favourable  districts.   A heavy  mortality among lambs is reported  as a result  of the  wst weather.                                Land,Division.[i&amp;nlrSe11 le me nt.      Ap,p.l jL o at ions h for .Small.

          In addition,  the Eo Td have undor  consideration  proposals by County Councils for  the acquisition of a  total area  of  59,134acres,  including 2,501  acr- s which the Councils  propose to  acquireby the  exercise of compulsory powers.   Of this  total 54,131 acresare in England and 5,003 acres  in Y*ales.          The following are examples of proposals for theacquisition of land by County Councils which have been  dealt with bythe Board during the week:-     Bedford .   The purchase of the Strattcn Park instate ,  Biggieswade,comprising 402 acres, for a perpetual rentcharge of  850 per annum.     Flintshire.   The  compulsory acquisition of 55 acres  at Sealand.     Offers of land by landowners,   A further 22 offers have beenreceived direct by the  Board in response to  the  presidents appealto landowners to offer  to County Councils or the Board  any of their land which might be suitable for small holdings.   The  total numberof such offers already  received by the Board is  104, comprisingapproximately 17,180 acres.   Of these 25 offers, representing 569acres,  have been declined as unsuitable.     farm Settlements administered by the Beard.   Negotiations  forthe purchase of the estates at  Amesbury, 7ilts,  and Kelham, Hotts, towhich reference was made in last week&apos;s report,  have been  completed.          The Amesbury property, 2,377 acres, vacant possession  on the14th inst., v/as&apos;&quot;purc3i sed for  35,000, of which  27.500 is ts be  paidby means of a 5% rentcharge and the balance  ( 7,500) in  cash.   For thepresent the property will be managed on behalf of the Board by theson of the late &quot;owner.          Kelham.   -This estate, comprising  2,769 acres, was purchasedfor the sum of  47,750 including mineral righto, timber, etc.    Vacantpossession of the greater part of the property will be  obtained  en 6thApril next.          Other areas comprising about 13,000 acres in  all are nowbeing inspected with a view to possible acquisition as  landsettlements.                                            existing          There are new working on the Board&apos;s/tfarm Settlements  70 ex-service men and 20 men belonging to Agricultural Companies.   Afurther 16 ex-Service men have been accented as probationers but havenot yet started work..          l?ield work has been greatly hindered by heavy  rain  duringthe last v/eek both at Pair in/4 ton and Holbeach, although  at  thelatter Settlement a little wheat has been drilled and seme  ploughinghas also been done.          The Heath Erj 11 Settlement was visited during the  week by arepresentative of the Department,  and the division of the land intosmall holdings was finally decided upon.   The size cf the  holdingswill be for fruit and market garden holdings 7-12 acres,  anddairyholdings 15-45 acres.   The land is so divided that it is possiblefor the size of the holdings to be increased in the future.   Theplanting cf fruit trees :n some of the fruit holdings is to beccrrmencei at once.          At the Pemb:;ey Settlement very heavy rain with the resultant flooding of the land has prevented all field work during  thewee]:.   A further report has been received on the drainage  of theSettlement,  ,A new outfall is essential, and this will  entail a  re-inforced concrete pipe cf 4 ft. diamater being carried through the
IS existing  sea wall into the present outlet dyke.   The estimated cost of  the work is 52,500.   The high price is largely due to the diffie lty of obtaining suitable labour in the district, contractors complaining that ex-Service men do not settle down to more than a few days&apos; work at a time.   It will not be possible to commence this work till the summer months.70rk  of Agricultural Executive Committees.           In view of the shortage of labour and the unfavourable weather conditions which have prevailed during the past autumn ani winter, the Board have during the past week addressed a circular letter to Agricultural Executive Committees asking them to issue a public notice that all cultivation orders are withdrawn except those Which have been served in the interests of go*d husbandry.   The Committees have also been asked to inform farmers that they have a free choice ffcr the present season as to the crops to be grown en their lands, but to urge upon them the need for cleaning their land and for providing v/inter feed for live stock, and to point out the necessity of converting the abundant straw crops into manure.      Determination of tenancies.   During the week two orders have been , made by the Board determining tenancies on acoount of bad farming it respect of 117 acres,   (l) a farm (63 acres) at Heatley in Cheshire, owned by  Messrs. Brunner Liond and Co.   The Executive Committee informed  the Board that the land in question has been deteriorating for the last fourteen years under the present tenant.   There is practically no stock on the farm and no Arrangements have been marte tc  provide the necessary manure for the land.   The Board&apos;s Sub- Commissioner for the county has also reported that the case is a very bad one of neglect and apathy on the part of the tenant and has pressed for the immediate determination of the tenancy.   The Board have accordingly determined the tenancy.       (2)  A 54-acre. farm at Little Rallright in Oxfordshire.   It was inspected by an officer of the Executive Committee in karch 1917 and was adversely reported upon.   A severe 1-tUr was addr ssed tc the tenant but no continue d improvenu nt resuited, and in January 1913 the Committ^- requested that tin- tenancy should be determines!.   The Board&apos;s Sub-Commission r for the county inspected the land and reporfce that in his opinion, although the farm was no doubt in a neglected condition, hardship would be imposed upon the tenant if his tenancy Wi-rv determined at once.   He sugg* sted that the tenant should be given dt finite cultivation orders and that h* should be warned that failure to cemply with them would mean determination of the tenancy. Tht Committee followed this suggestion, but now report that the tenant has made no r.-al effort to comply with the- orders served upos him.   In order that the necessary spring, cultivations may be under- tab n, the Board have determined the tc-nanoy forthwith.      Provision of Allotments.   In three districts in Yorkshire and  Dt nbi^hshire where the demand for allotments exoeeds the supply,  the  Executive  Committees have taken possession of various small pieav-s of  land and have 1* t them to the Parish Council concerned for allotments  The Board&apos;s Inspectors report that three Local Authorities have  acquired under the Cultivation of Lands Order 18 acrrs of land which  will provide 253 allotments.   Him:  ottur Local Authorities are  negotiating undt r the Small Holdings and Allotments Act for 42 aores  of land out cf which 386 allotments will be provided.Land Drainage,       The Great Quse .   At two meetings held this week a draft scheme  for setting up a Drainage Board to control the whole system of the  Great Ouse has been explained by representatives of the Department.  The first was a meeting of Pen-men held at 31y, and the second a  meeting of representatives of the Agricultural Ilxecutive Committees  tif the counties concerned held at Cambridge at the invitation of  &quot;he  Executive Committee of that county.   At both, unanimous resolutions
Jvgre  passed in favour of the  establishment  of  a  single Board;&quot;Lwose were seconded, by the  Chairman of  the  Bedford Level Corporation in each case.   It  is satisfactory  to note  that  at the Cambridge meeting,  while of course none  of  the representatives committed themselves to details of the  scheme, general approval was extended to it by the representatives of  the  upland counties such as Bedfordshire as well as by those of the  Pen counties.    At  both meetings resolutions were also unanimously passed  urging  the Board of Agriculture to undertake the  cleansing  of the  main channels of the puee  and Ten Mile Rivers pending  the establishment of a single Bo^rd.           An order  has been made  for setting up  Drainage Committees for Surrey and Cardiganshire  in addition  to the  eight other counties ialready referred to in previous reports.                            Horticultural  Division.      Fruit *   Reports from Cornwall reveal  a very unsatisfactory ;condition of affairs regarding fruit cultivation.   With few (exceptions the apple orchards  have  been greatly  neglected for years, jthe trees are covered with lichen,  spraying has  not been done, and Ipruning has not been attended  to  for a  considerable period,   No plantings cr replacements have been carried cut, and consequently I the trees are old and carry only  fruit  of an inferior and unsaleable I quality.          The demonstration fruit plot at Helbeach Crown Settlementhas been planned and marked cut ready for planting, and arrangementsIhave been made for the planting of the trees.     Bees *   The final arrangements are now being made for theimportation of Dutch stocks and Italian queens under the Board&apos;sBee Re-stocking scheme.          A deputation from the Kent Bee Bei-development Committee hasbeen received and a special scheme was submitted on behalf of theCommittee for the re-stocking of bees in that county.     Baskets.   Licences for the importation of baskets from Hollandhave now been retaked by the Board of Trade, and considerableconoern is being expressed by the Distributory Trades Associationthat the supply of agricultural baskets will hot aOder this restriction be sufficient to meet the expected heavy demands duringthe coming season.   The matter is now under consideration.     Small hive Stock.   A list of poultry farmers willing to take exservice men as pupils is being prepared.   It is to be feared,however, that the terms offered by the poultry farmers will be  -generally such as can be acceptable only to men .vh3 are prepared topay for their own maintenance, and also a fee for instruction.          Owing to the increased supply cf eggs, and the consequentdecrease in price, the kinistry of Feed have suspended the EggPrices Order.     Instruction and Advice.   A visit has been paid to the  -Monmouthshire Agricultural and Horticultural Institute at Usk.In spite of the fact that the school was only started in 1914 andthat it has been badly hampered in building and in obtaining equip-ment a four-acre plot has been laid out as an instructional marketgarden.          Assistance is being given to a movement which is beingstarted in Manchester and Liverpool to provide horticulturalinstruction to allotment holders through the Education Committee inthese cities.
(                             Technical Division.        Fineness of Ground limestone.    From time  to  time  enquiries  have   &quot;been-received from lime producers and agriculturists  for  information   as to  the degree of fineness to which limestone should  be reduced for   soil treatment.   Although the genera] de&amp;ire Cf the producer  is to   obtain material  that shall satisfy  the reoiilaments of  the  consumer,   his main interest arises from the fact that;, with  a given grinding   plant  the producing capacity is inversely,  and  the cost of  production   directly, proportional to the degree of fineness to be  attained.   While   the farmer is necessarily concerned in any change  which makes  for   higher charges,  he also requires to be satisfied that the product shall   be sufficiently  rapid and efficient in action to compare  favourably   with ground lime and other materials.  l&apos;n the absence of  any  practical   trials in this country with limestone of  different degrees  of  sub-   division,&apos; and owing to the lack cf  data with regard to  any  one sample   of material which may have been used in comparative work  with burnt   lime,  it was decided to carry out at Rothamsted a  scries  cf pot   experiments with different fractions of one and Iho same  sample of   ground limestone.  Equal quantities of the  different  fractions of   limestone were applied in december  up to  the full  lime  requirement   of -the soil, and barley seeds were  sown in pots in April.  ^he-   result s up to date indicate that the crop oboai.noa with lunasoone   ground to such a degree of fineness that  it will pass   cie^a with   100 meshes to the inch (i ,e. the fineness of oosic slag)  is only   some 5 to 10 per cent, greater than that  obtained  with  1e3s tinoly-   ground material  such as passes a sieve with 30  meshes to  the  inch.   It appears doubtful,  therefore, whether the increased cost  involved   in producing very finely ground material  is likely to be  recoverable   in increased crop.       Laying of Corn Crops.  A report compiled from tho  results of   the enquiry recently made into the  oauses of the laying of  corn crops   has been considered by the Technical Committee. It was pointed out   that the enquiry had elicited no new facts  and  that there was need   for experimental investigation.  One of the chief  causes  referred! to   is an  excess of  nitrogenous manuring and  it is  noticed  that grain   crops  following  potatoes or market  garden crops, or taken on  land   which  has been heavily manured for  a root crop,  are specially liable   to suffer^  Thick sowing,  which gives rise  to an overcrowded crop   with weak straw, is another cause.   In.fact, the more the effort  tA   obtain a big crop,  the greater is the danger of its being laid.   While  it is difficult tcstrike a balance  between the  yield  aimed  at   and the liability to laying,  the following measures have  bean  found   beneficial,  Phosphatic manures, such as  superphosphate,  have .the   effect of stiffening the straw;  nitrogenous fertilisers,   especially if used alone,  are risky,  except on  poor lando  An oat   crop may be stiffened with a few beans, which can  easily  be   separated in threshing.  A corn crop may  be fed off with  sheep in   larch  or April,   This may reduce the yield, but grazed  crops  have   been known to yield over nine quarters per  acre.  Where lodging is   feared, varieties of corn  which have proved to stand&quot; well  should,   if they are otherwise suitable, be  sown.   Of barleys  Maltster   Archer and Plumage Archer are best  as regards straw.  Staridwell and   Binder are fairly satisfactory;  Sprat stands well;.   Archer5s   Stiff  Straw and  the Goldthorpe types are  fair,  but the  latter when   dead-ripe are prone to shed their ears.             Of oats, Yielder and Record would appear to be  among the   best;   Victory and Banner stand moderately.  Black Tartarian  and   Abundance are also fairly good standers.             Of wheats,  Stand Up White,  Iron (Swedish)&apos;,  Penman, Yeoman   and Browick will probably be found  the most satisfactory, with   Squarehead&apos;s Master,  Wiihelmina and Benefactor  as  good  seconds.
                       LABOUR DIVISION.     -Training of .%x-Be r-y&quot;ice Men.  The first of the Centres to he established&quot; f or the  tFeTning of ex-Service men in the ordinary manual  operations  of a farm v/as opened on Monday the 17th inst. at Brentwood,  TSssex.  SO men were entered for training at this Centre  and  it is proposed  to  increase this number to 100 within the next two  or three  weeks.   In addition to general farm work, tractor- driving will be taught at  this Centre.          Numerous enquiries are now being received from men with no experience  cf agriculture who desire to take up an open-air life after the war and  arrangements are being made to established further Training Centres in various parts of the country as quickly as possible .    * P^ojDJ^lisjitj^qn.  An additional 17.268 agriculturists were demobilised  clucxuVthe seven days ended 12th March, the total number of such men  released up to that date being 153.869.  The rate of release has  now ralien from about 4,000 men per day to 2,500 per day.  This decrease  was expected in view of the Army Order retaining for the  Armies of Occupation all men who enlisted after the 1st January, 1916.  The Department of Demobilisation have been asked for a  decision on the Board&apos;s request that in view of the serious shortage of  agricultural labour and the probability that all prisoner labour will bo lost at a comparatively early date, all agriculturists should be released from the Forces irrespective of the date of  their  enlistment.          Local enquiries  are being made in conjunction with the Ministry of  Labour into cases where it is alleged that men with agricultural  experience are receiving the Unemployment Donation, although a demand  for agricultural labour exists in the district.     3 oll^er^ Labour.  A further 4,237 soldiers of Agricultural Companies were demobilised during the week, the total number of men released from these  Companies to date being 41,634.                        foe-men&apos; s Branch.     General.  It  is difficult at this stage to estimate the number of women who will  be  required for the coming season, as the wholu   ... : labour question  is now in a very unsettled condition. Again,   it is difficult to  guage at this time the effect upon employ- ire nt of the  increased minimum wage of the Land Army, while a recent decision of  the &quot;&quot;ages Board in regard to overtime payment on Saturdays also affects the question.          The recruiting of the extra 5,000 will therefore be care- fully watched, and as far as it is possible to arrange it .the numbers required  in each county will be supplied on a county basis.   Full  information as to the present situation has been given to the  itiinistry of Labour.          From Cumberland;  requests have already been received forharvest workers,  and an enquiry is being made by the Group Leader as to the  probable  demand f.-rom the  County as a whole.   It is reported from Devonshire  that women aie being dismissed from the farms in order to make room icx the men who are returning to agricultural work,  but a certain number are being employed on thelarge  estates.  The chief demand in this County is for dairy workers,while  in Bucks mcie women are wanted to tiain.  Worcester hasapplied for a noseible 300 women,  in anticipation of a shortageof labour  when the  German Prisoners are withdrawn.                                   6 .
      west  Sussex.  It was., stated in a quarterly report recently  received from West Sussex that the Efficiency Tests held in the County  have proved  the excellence of the training supplied.  31 claBB &quot;A&quot;  Certificates (90% and over) and 72 Class &quot;B&quot; Certificates (75$ to  90%) have  &quot;been gained in  milking, carting, .oloughing and stoOk-^work,  Three  couples of thatchers have also been trained and have done  excellent  work.  One couple is still employed on the straw-ricks and  is booked  Well into the coming month.         . ,  the examiner, the Farm Manager of the South Eastern  Agricultural Ktllege at Wye, reports that the standard of efficiency*  was of a very high &amp;rder, and the percentage of passes most satis-  factory   He adds that the organization and training of the Women  Land workers generally in this area is on a high level, and that much  good work  is being accomplished throughout the County.      Kent.  A Rally of L.A.A.&amp;. was recently held at Sittingbourne,.  where  a farmer present expressed his gye&amp;t hope that women would  continue to  be available  for land work, after the demobilization of  the Land Array.  He said frankly that he did not know what the farmers  would  have done without their help, more particularly with the  threshing  work.  He added that there would always be plenty of work  for women  in that district during the fruit season, and that even  before the war there had  invariably been a great shortage of labour  in that direction.      Women&apos;a Institutes.  The Women1ft Institute Organizer for the  Midlands reports that the Secretary of the Leicestershire Education  Committee  is willing to provide training for lecturers for Women&apos;s  Institutes on subjects for which lecturers are not at present avail-  able .   Candidates for such training will be nominated by the  Leicestershire Federation Committee.            15 new Institutes were started last week, brining the total  up to  928.                             Cultivation Divisiqn.      Tractor work.  During the week ended 28th February, 4617 acres  were ploughed, 78 acres were cross ploughed and,119 acres were  cultivated.  Difficulties with regard to labour for tractors have been  reported from a number of counties and in certain instances increases  in pay have  been sanctioned to bring the wages %% approximately the  same level as skilled farm hands.      Steam Tackle .  During the past week, 92 acres were ploughed and  84 acres were cultivated. total 176 acres.      Liquidation of Tractor and Horse Schemes.  The position remains  as reported  last week.  A few counties are modifying their proposals  having regard to the recent unfavourable weather.  The Committees  who have not yet put forward a scheme have been asked to do so  without delay.            Sales of horse-drawn implements have been held at Lutter-  worth, Northampton, Durham and Barnstaple.  The prices realised in  the first  three cases were very satisfactory;  as much as  40 being  received for Drills,  17. 10. 0. for Rollers,  47 for Lorries and   34 for Carts.  The sale  in Devon was not quite so good owing to the
w implements being on the heavy side for this county, but.the prices realised show only about a 25 to 35 per cent. loss.           Sales of horses are on the whole very satisfactory: 3,800 have been sold, the price averaging  61.  The best prices realised last week were at Huddersfield where 30 horses averaged  96.           At a sale in Hampshire on the 12th inst., FordsonTractors realised from  105 to  145:  these prices are considerably lower than those realised in 3ssex and the explanation appears to be that the Committee have weeded out their oldest tractors.  Some Titan Tractors which were sent to Hampshire in 1917 realised from  50 to  85.                           Commercial Division.      Sulphate of Ammonia.  Deliveries of Sulphate of Ammonia for home* agricultural purposes in the nine months June 1918 - February 1919 have amounted to 191,000 tons as compared with 160,600 tons in the same period last season, an increase of 19 per cent.  The available supply this season will be sufficient to enable all home demands to be met while leaving a balance for export.  Up to the end of February the quantity licensed for export in the nine months was 21,350 tons, and it will probably be possible to licence a further 20,000 tons without detriment to home supplies.  Up to the present licences have been limited to the Colonies and Allied Countries.      Basic Slag.  The output of basic slag is being well maintained the total deliveries in the current season being   420,700 tons as against 363,700 tons last season, an increase of 16 per cent.      Lime.  The lime supply in the Buxton district - the  principal producing centre - is much affected by housing difficulties, as it is impossible to employ more men under existing conditions.   There appears to be a good demand for agricultural lime, more orders being received than can be executed.  The urgency of the case has been represented to the Local Government Board.      T 95iSP.rJi*  Complaints of shortage of trucks on practically all railways are &quot;now being received.  The Railway Executive Committee has been asked to issue instructions for priority to be given to the despatch of fertilisers and seeds.  Special cases have been pressed upon the Railway Companies with good results in some instances.      Seed Oats   Tonnage has now been secured for 11,530  tons of seed oats for the French Government.  A portion of these oats  has been delivered;   a portion is on passage and the rest of this  quantity will be despatched during the current week.      Testing of Seeds Order.  Representations have been made by certain wholesale seed merchants that sales of seeds between wholesale merchants should be exempt from the requirements of the Order,  This point is being considered in connection with the draft Bill now in preparation.           Cases are being discovered where retailers are  selling packets)) of vegetable seeds supplied by wholesale firms for last season&apos;s trade,  and  which have,  in some instances deteriorated in germination. The retailers in question are being warned, and the attention of the wholesale seedsmen who  supplied the seeds is being drawn  to this breach of the Order.

Only 1 outbreak of Anthrax has been confirmed is against 29 suspected cases.  Of Sheep-Scab  there have been 33  reportsAnother outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth Disease  has  been confirmed,  but \fortunately inside the area already scheduled on account of the case&quot;at Leeds.  4 outbreaks of Rabies have been  confirmed during the week,three of these outside the Cornwall-Devon area, namely at Cardiff andat Pontnewydd near Newport (Mon) necessitating  the imposition  of   jrestrictions on movement of dogs out of an  area comprising the  whol of Monmouth and parts of Glamorgan and Brecknock and the muzzling ofdogs within that area.

The Order amending the Rats Order and the Local Govern-ment Board Order enabling Local Authorities to exercise their      \functions under it, referred to in last week&apos;s Report, have not yet&apos;been issued.          Measures for enforcing the Rats Order have been consideredby several Local Authorities during the last week and progress hasbeen made, notably by Glamorgan, who have voted  1,000 for expenditure on work under the direction of Professor Hedger Wallace,who has evolved a scheme for dividing the county into 3 districts of approximately 70,000 acres, to be treated respectively withLiverpool Virus, Danysz. Virus and a Squill preparation.          Devon have been testing methods of rat destruction in districts in the County, but the results and relative value ofthe several plans are not yet to hand.  A comprehensive schemeinvoking the estimated outlay of  15,000 was submitted by the RatsSub-Committee of the County to the Council bwt they decided that before committing themselves to this larger scheme the experimentsshould be carried further.  For this purpose they have voted thesun of . 1,000.          Many suggestions have been received as to the use ofpoison gas.  Several of these have come from Military Officers, whoevince a natural desire to turn the knowledge gained by them, asexperts in poison gas warfare, to some account.  That some of theless dangerous gases can be used under certain conditions withuseful effect under supervision by experts is not questioned, butit seems to be impracticable to use them on a large scale.  this opinion has been confirmed by experiments made in Devon and alsoin the United States          As evidence of the loss sustained in the corn growingdistricts and the need for strong countering measures against ratsand mice, the following may be given as an illustration:-          A farm near Winchester with 1200 acres of arable,produced 36 stacks of corn.  Of these, up to the 11th instant, 12wheat and 9 oat stacks had been threshed.  The estimated damage perS+POIV     ;:/; v.o-V&quot;      i fi p( n^o.    tW a* ?t 56/- per sack ( 216)
and 90 sacks of oats at 25/- per sack ( 112.  10.)  a total  loss  of. 328. 10.  15 stacks infested with rats remain to  he  threshed.  Fromall accounts this is by no means an exaggerated or isolated  case.                          Veterinary Department.

Agricultural Wages Board.           Meetings of the &quot;Administration&quot;,  &quot;Cottages&quot; and &quot;Customary&quot; Hours Committees were held on 12th March and a meeting of the &quot;Selection&quot; Committee  on the  13th, immediately prior to the meeting of the Wages Board on that day.           The twenty-eighth meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board was held on Thursday and Friday the 13th and  14th March.           A large number  of letters were reported from Workers&quot; Organisations asking for  an immediate increase in the  minimum rates of wages fixed by the Board.    A number of letters were also reported from Employers1  Organisations  on the  same question.           The Gloucestershire,  Cheshire, Devonshire and Camlis.. Hunts,  and Beds,  District Wages Committees reported the action&apos; taken by them in regard to proposed increases in the minimum rates.           The Board dealt with various natters of general and  local interest among  whioh were the following:-      Customary Hours.   The Board adopted a report from the committee appointed to  consider and report upon the general question of fixing minimum rates on the basis of &quot;customary hours&quot;,  and in accordance with the  recommendation of the Committee,  decided to inform eaoh of  the District VTages Committees  for which  special rates  had been  fixed for  special classes  of     workers on  the basis  of  an unspecified number of cusftomary hours,  that such method, of fixing  rates appeared to the  Board to  be  open to serious  objection, that it  had led to difficulties  in administration,  and that the  Board  considered it should no  longer be  continued.      Three  ether possible methods  of  dealing with the  special classes  of  workers  in these areas were  suggested to the District Wages Committees and  they were  asked to inform the Board which of usch such methodB  they preferred, and  to furnish  the  Board with such information  as would  enable  ffessh  orders  to  be made  ifnecessary.      Increase  of minimum  rate for adu^t  workers. Considerable discussion  tsok place on  the motion of the representatives ofworkers - adjourned from previous meeting  to  allow the presentation  cf the Report of the Committee  on Farming costs and Cost  of Living - for a general increase  in the minimum rate  for  adult male workers  of  1 a week.  The representativesof employers  intimated that  subject to an understanding thatany customs at present existing for the  payment  of harvestmoney and other deferred pay be abolished, they would be  -prepared to accept a revision of the present minimum rates asfollows, viz,,  (1) of an addition of 5/- per week to the weekly wages speolfied in  the Board&apos;s  Orders  for the same number of hours, in the case of male workers  of 21 and  over of all olasses, and (2) by the fixing-  of special overtime
 rates  for all male workers  in  corn harvest, based on double time.   On the suggestion of the Appointed Members the preamble to  the  employers&apos; amendment was withdrawn by them, and it was proposed by the employers that the question of the abolition of  harvest money, Miohaelmaa money and other payments of the nature  of deferred wages be  referred for consideration to the District v/ages Commit to as in those areas where such payments have hitherto been made.  After protracted negotiations the representatives of workers withdrew their original proposal in faTout  of a motion for a general increase of 15/- per week, and when this had been defeats:!, they moved an amendment for an increase of 10/- per week, which was also defeated.  Ho agreement between the Sides having after further negotiations --been reached, it was  eventually decided to adjourn consideration of the matter, and to  ask the President of  the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, with whom should be associated the Prime Minister or a Member of the Government representing him, and the Minister of labour, to receive a deputation representing all sections of the Board, to plaoe before him the position which had been reached with regard to the proposed general increase in the minimum rates.  It was decided to summon a special meeting of the wages Board in the following week to receive and consider the report of the deputation.     Disputes between farmers and agricultural workers. The Board agreed to accept a &apos;i&apos;nvit;a^ion from the&apos;&apos; President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to nominate representatives from each Side of the Board to attend a j*sint conferenoe of representatives of the National Agricultural Council and of the wages Board for the purpose of considering the question of establishing some machinery for dealing by conciliation with such disputes.     Orders flain?         rates 0  On the recommendation of the Administration Committee&apos; the Board decided to modify theprovisions as to the institution of legal proceedings in respect of non-compliance with the Orders fixing minimum rates, and to  take proceedings in all clear cases of non-payment, unless  owing to special circumstances in any particular case a resort to prosecution would be harsh or inequitable.  The Board also decided to invite representatives of employers1 and workers&apos; organisations to a Conference, for the purpose of inviting their co-operation in the work of enforcement of the board&apos;s&quot;Orders, and&apos; more particularly with a view to ensuring that any complaints by members or officials cf the Unions should be oarefully sifted beforehand, so that only well- grounded eomplaints are  sent to the Board, and that the Information furnished In regard to these shall be complete and precise.          It was reported that up to the 8th Maroh,1919, the sum of  1136 had been paid to workers in arrears of wa$es,  as a result of action taken by the Inspectorate.
     Preseout ions.   Proceedings against an employer in Suffolk fornon-compliance with the Board&apos;s Orders were heard at Long  Melford onMarch 14th.  The proceedings were taken in respect of the  untie 2-payment of an adult male vforker and a boy.  An Inspector visited the employer in November and found two workers to be paid at  lees thanthe rates applicable to them.  The employer had been refused a Permitby the District ^:ages Committee in respect of the otter man and hadbeen advised by the Farmers&quot;&apos; Union that he must pay up all arrearstill harvest but that he could offset harvest money against arrearsafter harvest.  The employer promised to pay but said he would not continue to employ the man.  The worker had been promised  employment at another farm but had failed to obtain it and at the Sub-Committee the employer admitted that the second employer had asked himif he wanted the worker which appeared to indicate a conspiracy toprevent the worker from getting another situation.  The employer wasfined  10 with  5 costs and ordered to pay the arrears of  wages,  the bench ruled that the harvest payments were an entire],y separate matter.and could not be offset by the defendant against arrears of wages.          An employer in Suffolk was summoned at Ixworth on March 17thfor  non-compliance with the Board&apos;s Orders in respect of  the paymentof two boys.  After a visit from an Inspector the employer paid thearrears, but subsequently discharged the boys, and a man employed byhim belonging to the same family.  The defendant was convicted andfined  6 and  5 costs, and ordered to pay the arrears due.     L^Kiai^M*  During the week 103 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received, the largest number froma single county being 31 in the case of Carnarvon;  31 cases were sentto Inspectors for visit;  enquiries by correspondence were made in234 cases;  and 18 cases were completed.  Reports were received fromInspectors in 39 cases.               Tithe,.Commons. Copyhold and Survey Branch.          Correspondence and other work in compulsory as well as  involuntary redemptions is steadily increasing.  One of the  compulsoryredemption cases now in progress affects mainly house property inWednesbury (staffs) .  In this case, in which nearly 1,000  property owners are concerned, the schedule of assessments of redemption money and expenses has been deposited in the parish for inspection by those interested.  In a Farrington (Lanes) redemption the number of ownersis well over 1,000.     Allowance for collecting Tithe Rentcharge.  In arriving at thenet anneal value of tithe rentcharge for the purpose of calculatingredemption money the Board are required by the Tithe Act,  191?, todeduct J-nter^alia such sum not exceeding 2j$ of the &quot;GRCS3 annual value&quot; as, in the opinion&apos;of the Beard, represents the necessary  costof collection of the       rentcharge .  The Board have decided that,in applying the discretionary power thus given them, the maximum,  ofZf/i shall be deducted in all cases, except in the very few. instances where the collector employed does the work for less than 2f%, or where it is shown that the case is one in which the employment of acollector would be  unreasonable.  In actual practice about b% is  thecommission paid in an average case.
     M^^^^S^^^ll-^^17th.^!!^&apos;  The  Board.1 s  Report  toParliament on the provisions of this Bill,  which affect&apos;commons, hasbeen prepared.  The Corporation of ivianchester propose to  acquire an area cf about 23,000 acres in the  Lake District  in the County isfV/eetmorland and the adjoining Counties of Lancashire  and  Yorkshire,including upwards of 13,000 acres  of Common lands, for the purposeof constructing reservoirs and other works  required for  the  improve-ment of the water supply of Manchester and  for preserving the waterfrom pollution.          The area proposed to be  taken includes part of  a districtwhich is much resorted to by the public on  account of the beauty of itsscenery, and one of the recommendations made  in  the Board&apos;s  Report isthat provision should be made for  the public  to  have  the  privilegeat all times of enjoying air, exercise and  recreation on such partsof any commons or unenclosed land  acquired  by the Corporation asshall not be included within the limits of  deviation  for the proposedworks.   Another recommendation made is that  it  should be expresslyprovided by the Bill that, except  by agreement,  the Corporation shallnot acquire or extinguish any commonable rights  as regards the grazing of sheep, except in or over such lands as are within thelimits of deviation shown on the deposited  plans in respect  of thereservoirs and works authorised by the Bill.
