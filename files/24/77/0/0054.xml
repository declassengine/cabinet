PART  TO-ACTION  TAKEN.          Food Council. The Council met on March &apos;20th and 25th.   .      r        ;:          It was reported that the accumulated stocks of millers&apos; offals in the hands  of the      Ministry now amounted to 26,000 tons and it was agreed that, subject to the sanction      of H.M.  Treasury, the price should be reduced  throughout  the country by  21. per      ton until the accumulation had  been disposed  of;  since otherwise it was practically      certain that a number of mills would be compelled to stop work.        .  .   . .          Following  on the decision  to  decontrol  oilseeds, it  was  agreed  that as  ample    -  supplies  were to be expected, the,Ministry&apos;s stocks should be liquidated, subject to      the reservation of such quantities as  the Food Controller might  decide should be sent -      to Germany. The prices at which these stocks should be sold were to be fixed  as low .      as the current  trade  would bear.   With  a view to preventing profiteering it was      decided  that a new Maximum Prices Order should he issued and that, export should      be permitted only under the sanction of the Ministry.          In view of improvements in the coffee situation, owing to the  fact that private      importers have arranged for the early importation of some J 8,000 tons of coffee, it was      decided that importers should be allowed  to re-export 70 per cent, of all coffee which      reaches this country after April 1st, on condition that the  remaining 30  per cent, is      sold for  home consumption.  It is estimated that  under  this  arrangement the home      demand  for coffee will be amply covered.   In view of the altered, conditions  it was      decided  to  inform II.M.  Treasury that there  is now no objection  to the export of      5,000 tons of coffee to Sweden provided that this  coffee comes out of Prize Court      stocks which have been neither condemned nor ordered to be sold.          The  question of  the de-control of imported  meat was considered and it  was      agreed that, subject to the concurrence of the Board1 of Trade, steps should be taken      to dispose of the Ministry&apos;s stocks and purchases at their existing market value by      approximately June 30th  next, with a view to avoiding the accumulation of  stocks      which has  now  begun and is  expected  to  become  more serious.  The  supplies      available after June 30th  will be sufficient to ensure that the  withdrawal of  control      does not lead to an increase in price.  Owing to the  maintenance  of  the guarantee      to the British farmers until September 30th and the resulting necessity for controlling      home-killed meat until  that date,  the system of registration of customers  and of      butchers&apos; permits must  be maintained after June 30th, but while the amount of      home-killed meat issued  to retailers will  still be controlled,  it is proposed to make      the purchase of imported meat by retailers free from restrictions.          Consumers1 CounciL-Tke Council met on March 25th.      &quot; &apos;  The  question of the  derationing of butter was discussed.   The Council raised no      objection to the abolition of the coupon at the beginning of May, but were not prepared      to agree  to the removal of registration until such date  as  it was amply clear that no      future shortage would occur.          Central Agricultural Advisory Council. A meeting of the Central Agricultural      Advisory Council was held on March 18th.          A Sub-Committee was appointed to advise as regards the method  to  be adopted      with a view to restricting the number of  cattle coming forward in the autumn  during      the last weeks of control, and ensuring supplies for the following months.          The measures taken to dispose of the 1918 potato crop both in Great  Britain and      in Ireland were also discussed, and it was stated that in spite of  difficulties of transport      the quantity of potatoes moved this year was 300,000 tons in  excess of the amount      moved during the corresponding period of last year.   At present 10,000 tons  a week      are  being shipped  abroad from Lincolnshire, 2,000 to 3,000  tons a week are being      sent from Ireland to France, and  52,100 tons  a week  from  Ireland to South  Wales;      some small quantities are also being sent to Portugal.           .if.  :          A (33)7576-4  Pk SI  1511      K&amp;S                                         AI
                              NATIONAL KITCHENS.    Up to the present time the National Kitchens  Division of  tne  Ministry  hasbeen responsible  for  the  control and management of the following restaurants  andkitchens :-                                              -        New Bridge  Street Restaurant.   1       Southampton-Canteens,        Westminster Bridge Road.             Lycet Hall.  i    !    Dongola Hall.                     .   Poplar.    The Dockers Committee at Southampton are anxious to take over the SouthamptonCanteens,  and the Committee  and the Member for  Southampton, Captain DudleyWard, M.P., have been seen with a view to this arrangement being carried out, subjectto. the Committee paying the  cost incurred  by the Ministry for fixed and loose plant.A. lease on the premises is  being arranged with the London  and  South  Western.Railway Company so that  the canteens may be handed over as. a going concern with a security of tenure.                                ,   ; *   The New Bridge Street restaurant has proved a  financial success.  The weeklytakings amount to 7001., and the average net profit during the last four weeks  has been120Z. per week, showing a net profit on sales of 15&apos;9 per cent.  -The buildings are held.on a single year&apos;s tenancy which expires in May, but a renewal for a further period,of six months has been obtained.    The Poplar Kitchen  has been closed, as  the swimming baths in  which it  was established will be re-opened for use during the summer.    The  division  is  further  responsible for  the  inspection  of public  kitchensthroughout the country.   It  appears that since the Armistice kitchens  have every-where  been gradually closing down, but it must  be borne in mind that these were for the most part hastily equipped and run  on emergency rather than economic lines,and that in some cases they were established in public baths  and institutions whichare now wanted for other purposes.  The  experience of the Department has shown.that, under proper management, these kitchens can  be run without loss, and it isalmost certain that with the recurrence of winter conditions the  demand for them will again arise.    The division is, therefore, being reduced to the  footing of a small but capablebranch which can form the nucleus of headquarters administration in case of  transfer to a permanent  Department..  The  Local, Government Board have been approachedand are considering the advisability of including in a General Powers Bill  provisionswhereby local authorities can establish, take. over, and  maintain public kitchens  and restaurants.  .  .        :;\)f; :,.r   ,  .          :,              a.-J;,  . ..,.    ..]    Royal Parka. It has been  proposed by H.M. Office of Works, that the NationalKitchens Division should take over the catering iti the Royal Parks, viz.:- ! .,  ...   .....Kensington Gardens. . .             .

Office of Works let the catering&apos;out by tender and  receivedsums varying from 250L  to  1,0001. per annum from caterers for the  privilege of selling food.   It has  been  suggested that a more efficient service can be provided bythe National  Kitchens Division,  and the proposal,  is  now under consideration.  Allstores would  be purchased and the establishments managed by arrangement with theTreasury..                     &quot; ;:    SUPPLIES  AND DISTRIBUTION.    &apos; ;-&quot;    Meat.-A considerable proportion of the meat allowed under the,present ration of24 ozs. is not being consumed.  In South Wales the quantity not taken up last week amounted to 42 per cent., while in the  Central Southern Counties it was 38 per cent.,in Cumberland and Westmorland 37 per cent., in parts of Lancashire 30 per cent&apos;., andin the East Midlands 28 per cent.  This cannot be entirely attributed to the unpopularityof frozen meat.   The fact that home-killed and frozen&quot;meat.are at present  sold  at thesame  price  tends  to  discourage the consumption of  frozen  meat, while  the fall in purchasing power resulting from the Cessation of. high  war wages iii certain industriesalso reduces the  effective  demand.  As has  already  been announced,1 the  price of imported meat is being reduced by 2d. per lb-, on May  5th.
     Arrangements have been made for the shipment  of  745 tons of canned meat to poland,  In  addition, 3,000 tons are  being reserved lor Rumania and 1,000 tons forSerbia,... These orders will be completed  as soon as the necessary shipping can  beobtained. &apos;            V/V &apos; rA  /,v:&apos;&quot;    &quot;   :^;?;,M-&apos;f.

Margarine.-RLT is reported that,in the West of  Scotland the termination of theMargarine Distribution Scheme  lias1 been a source of regret both to wholesale and retail&apos;traders, since on the removal of  control the  large multiple traders have made a determined  effort&quot;&quot; to capture  the trade by cutting prices.   In the North-EasternDivision the supply of margarine is now in the hands of a small number of firms, andthe price of M. per lb. does not enable small retailers to sell at a profit.     Tea.-The suspension  of the Orders governing the  distribution  and price of teacame into effect on March  24th, when large quantities of tea were on sale in retailers&apos;shops at between 2s.  and 2s. 6d. per lb.  The  finer grades of Indian and  Ceylonteas are now  being retailed at 3s. to 3s. 6o\ per lb. and China tea at 3s. to 48. per lb.     Dried Fruits. 8,000  tons  of  currants  and 3,400 tons  of  dates  are  beingdistributed this week.   .......                                                   : -     Cocoa.-3,150 tons of raw cocoa will be distributed this week, of  which 2,500 tons is  West  African cocoa? &quot;Over 9,000 tons of raw  cocoa have arrived during the last three Weeks.&quot;  It has been decided that the Raw  Cocoa Distribution Scheme shall be discontinued, so far as West African cocoas are concerned.               Orders under  Defence of the Realm Eegulations.     An  Order dated 20th March 19.1-0, amending the Imported Onions Order, 1918,substitutes new schedules  reducing the prices.  The  maximum retail price will beID. per  lb.     A general licence dated  21st March  1019,  under the Maize  Products&apos;(retail prices) Order, 1918, releases maize and maize products from restrictions as to  retail prices under  the Order.     A. notice, dated 21st March 1919,  revokes&apos;the Deer (Restriction of Feeding)  Order,1918, and the Growing Grain Crops Order, 1918.   The former prohibited the feedingof  cereals to deer; the latter prohibited the cutting of green crops for feeding cattle.     A notice under the Calves (Sales)  Order, 1918, reduces the price of calves as from31stMarch.   &apos;                  ,                      .\            &apos;  &apos;   &apos;  &apos;         ..

FART  II.-SUMMARY  OF THE  FOOD POSITION.                                     IMPORTS.     The total  imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs  in  the week  endedMarch 22nd (129,700  tons) were greater than those of the  five preceding weeks butthey  were still below  the  average  of  the first  12 weeks  of  the calendar year(150,000 tons) or of  the first 29 weeks of the cereal year (168,100 tons).  There were substantial imports  of rice  (14,500 tons), butter &apos;3,700 tons),  cheese (2,000 tons),sugar  (30,400  tons),  tea  (7,400  tons),  and coffee (1,200 tons),  as  well  as  oranges(11,700 tons), bananas (2,200  tons),  and onions (5,300 tons).     The figures for  the first 29 weeks of the cereal years 1917-18 and 1918-19 arecompared in the following table :    Total Imports for the first 29 weeks of Cereal Year (1st September to 22nd March),1918-19.Increase or Decrease on     1917-18.Total -wheat flour -Equivalent  as Grain.Rice  -Barley, oats,  and  maize.Meat -  Tons. .4,875,8001918-1 J).Increase or Decrease on     1917-18.

Butcher&apos;s Meat. There was a falling off in the supplies of livestock at markets inGreat Britain from the  high figures reached in the first week of the month.   estimated total supplies of home-killed meat for the week ended the 15th March were  17,000 tons,and releases of refrigerated  meat amounted to 9,400 tons, making total supplies equalto 26,500 tons.  Over  the four weeks ended the  15th March estimated consumption was  15,400 tons of home-killed meat  and  8,000  tons  of imported meat, a total of23,400 tons.  Of this  total, however,  only  19,200  tons were rationed meats.  Thedemand  for the latter, then,  was 20  per cent,  less  than  the quantity  which theMinistry was prepared  to distribute as rations and additional supplies to butchers andcaterers.     fish .-Th.e  following table illustrates supplies of  fish up to 15th March.  Withthe exception of supplies.at the six inland markets, the statistics indicate that supplies in March have been maintained at the February level  as contrasted with a  decreasebetween these two months in the last two years.   The statistics of  total landings onthe coasts of the United  Kingdom  show a considerable improvement  in the total supplies of  fish  as  a result of the greater facilities available since  the cessation ofhostilities.j &apos; ; ! - - January.

     Changes in, the stocks during the week ended 15th. March have been unimportantexcept for a decrease in meat of  3,600 tons, an increase in canned meat of 1,400 tonsand  a decrease in  condensed milk of 1,700  tons.   Bacon stocks in cold stores and warehouses showed  little  change.   Those   held  in. Great  Britain  amounted. to52,300 tons, or including all.registered wholesalers.56,400 tons.  This is equivalent&apos;to 3^ lbs. per  head of the population/ the distribution in the different; ioochcontrol.divisions being as  follows-Newcastle Division t\ lbs., Leeds 2\ lhs., Preston 7i lbs.&apos;,Nottingham If lbs., Birmingham 2f lbs., London 5  lbs., Reading\\ lbs., Bristol i\. lbs.,Cardiff 1 lb., Edinburgh 5f lbs. and Glasgow i\ lbs., small quanties only being storedin the Cambridge, Home Counties and Carnarvon Divisions.            &quot;  &apos; &quot;     Considerable changes in the stocks held  by the Ministry took-place during thefirst half of the month of March notably in bacon which declined from 44,401 tons to25,300 tons largely due to releases for export to Germany; meat, butter, cheese andtea stocks  were also considerably reduced.

The variations in food prices since July 1914 are given in Tables E and F, andit  has been  already pointed out that the weighted average  (as calculated by theDepartment of Labour Statistics) for March was 120 per cent., above that for July 1914.The general course of prices was a  rapid  rise from July 1914 to July 1917 (104 percent.) a smaller  rate of increase between July 1917  and  June 19.18 at which date thetotal increase was 108 per cent, (the rise having  been retarded in some degree by the bread subsidy) and  again a rapid rise to November  when  the maximum of 133 percent, was reached.   The figure remained at 130 per cent for December, January and february but took a definite downward direction to 120 per cent, for March.     These figures relate to  prices.   Variations in the  cost of living take into accountboth prices and  quantities consumed.  The best information on this  question is thatobtained by  the  Treasury Committee presided  over by  Lord Sunnier; the  working-class budgets collected by that Committee showed that the increase in expenditure on food had increased between June  1914 and June 1918 by 90 per cent.   By applying to  these figures the&quot; subsequent changes  in  prices recorded by the Department ofLabour Statistics and the changes  in the  quantities  of foodstuffs consumed by thegeneral population * the following estimate can  be  made  of the expenditure on food(cost of living) in November 1918 and in March 1919.  The latter figures are, likely tobe under-estimates since  the  consumption  in  March has probably increased&apos;beyondthe standard indicated by the figures at present  available.

The  figures  indicate  that  the sharp rise  in food  prices between June  and november  1018 was accompanied  oy a decreased  consumption  with the result  thatwhile prices rose from 108 per cent,  increase to  133  per cent,  increase, expenditurerose only from 90 per cent, increase to 1,00 per cent, increase.  Similarly when pricesfell from 133 per cent, in  November to 120 per cent, in March, there was no materialdecline in  expenditure on food which means, in general, an increase in the amountof food  consumed.   The movements   of prices  and  expenditure in the  near futuredeserve close attention.
