No. 15.             v or wook ended 29 th liar oh. 1019     Three German Subimirines,arrived at Harwich^during the week-,Tho German submarine which had be on found derelict and was towedinto Gorleston on 33nd March,is believed to be TJ.0-109,one ofthose which started from Germany on the 15th.     The Ssthonian S. S. fflEAJAK&quot; sailed from Liverpool on 23rdMarch with the following military stores consigned to theEsthonian Government.              116 Packages......II. T.

It has been decided that &quot;HOLLYWOOD&quot; shaltl take the BritishOonsul and Vice Consul to Reval and that tho remainder of the arms and aixiur&amp;tion on board consisting of 5840 Russian Rifleswith about 10,000,000 rounds and about 1,000,000 rounds ofammunition for  Lewis guns shall be landed at that Port.     The Germans have made several requests for free passage forVessels conveying coal,troops and supplies to Libau,but these have been refused by A.N.A.C in accordance with the decision of supreme War CounciloS.N.O. Baltic and the Military Mission now at Libau call attention to the grave responsibility incurred in hampering thoGerman Military operations at a moment when the Bolsheviks oanbring up reinforcements. They state that the Germans are using the Naval Blockade for Propaganda purposes and that if the Germanssuffer a set back they will doubtless lay  the blame on theAllies. Tho S.N.0. points out that as a cruiser is now permanentlystationed at Libau,. the arrival of supplies by sea can be controlled.      Mitau and Bausk have been captured by German troops,, and theevacuation of Riga by the Bolsheviks is expected shortly. It iSprobable that the Germans could capture Riga when they liked, butthe difficulty is one of supplying the town and district after it is taken, and thoy are demanding rolling stock for thispurpose.              ADRIATIC      The Admirals1 Committee, as a result of evidence heardduring their enquiry at Spalato recommended that the Blockade ofthe Adriatic should be raised mnediately, and the ItalianGovernment ha3 agreed to the adoption of this, course as from 30thMaroh. A now list of contraband has been drawn up, and the rightof search and prohibition of ohango of flag of enoi-jy1 s shipsremain in force.      Rear Admiral Sinclair coiaraanding the 3rd Light cruiser squadron took over the dutic3 of tho British Adriatic Force in succession to Commodore velly on March 24*      The Naval Baso at Brindisi was permanently clo3ed onMaroh 26th.
! ACS SSA AMD DAHPHSf   Tho  situation in South Russia although sorious appears unlikely  to  call for aotivo naval operations in the imaediato future. The  Bolsheviks have not yet attested to enter tho Crimea,but local efforts have boon made to agitato in Sevastopol-  These were sternly repressed by the Volunteer Arrry., and on tho 19th, the general situation was reported to be less acute.    Tho situation at Odessa is believed to be fairly satisfactory. General Eranchct d&apos;Esperoy has been appointed. Com lander-in-Chief in South Russia,and has arrived at Odessa, where he will decide the future Bourse of action.  Before leaving  Constantinople he was in favour of evacuating both Odossa and the Crimea, leaving tho  Naval harbour of Sevastopol in the hands of. tho Bolsheviks.    &quot;iron Duke&quot; and &quot;Emperor of India&quot; left Portsmouth on 25th and 29th Mar oh, respectively, on route to the Black fJea*    During a  recent visit to Bucharest ?Acbniral Troubridge was able to make arrangements with the Itoumanian Government for such supplies of  oil as he needs.    Policing on tho fall of Count Karolyl1 s Government, the following ships of the Danube Flotilla/Bosnia&quot;^ &quot;Enns , &quot;Sava&quot; &quot;Barseh&quot;, and two Motor Launohes proceeded on the 22nd March fr&quot;ora Baja to Budapest, under 3ritish and French col ours, Captain Haggard in command, to ensure tho safety of the Allied Mission. Thoy wore received by rifle fire, one Serbian Officer wa3 wounded, and M.L-228 7/as captured and disarmed. On the 23rd March, thd members of tho Armistice CortiaiSsion and Captain Haggard were reported prisoners /but M.L-228 had been released and re- armed, and apologies for her capture offered.  The Monitors had withdrawn to Baja to avoid  capture.  On 24th March, Admiral Troubridge requested reinforcement of River Craft by Monitors of the smallest type and Motor Launches, more Officers,and regular supplies of coali; He was informed on the same date that no more British monitors were available, but that &quot;Ladybird&quot; might be retained on tho Danube^ that six Motor Launches would be sent, and. that twenty Officers would leave England immediately for Budapest.    On 25th March, Captain Haggard reported himself (by W/T) in the hands of the Hungarian Revolutionary Government., The&apos; two Motor Launches were at Budapest and one ivould remain until the departure of the Allied Mission could be arranged.  On the same dato, tho Hungarian (Jovornmont stated that no members of theAllied Mission had been detained, that they would bo accompanied to the line  of demarcation in accordance with their own wishes, and that help and facilities had been offered to Colonel Vix, who was leaving that day.  Information from Colonel Vix on 20th March showed that tho Allied Military Commission had loft for Neusatz.    On 30th March Captain Haggard with M.L&apos;s 210,and 223, arrived at Baja.  Lieut.Commander Freeman remains at Budapest to organize the withdrawal of Allied Civilians and others.    Mines have boon laid in the Danube^ and Admiral Troubridqjo requests tho dispatch of minesv/eoping specialists and materials to Braila.

This involves     Caspian Naval Operations being transferred to the Italians,     and prelJu&amp;nary discussions in this connection  are talcing     plaoo.
