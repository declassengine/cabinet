(2) To raise the gravity from 10320 to 10360,      (3) That no announcement should be made until  the Chancellor  of         - the Exchequer had considered the bearing of (l)  and (2) on          taxation and prices, and &quot;that the publication of these          relaxations should be accompanied by an announcement that they          would be taken into account in the Budget.&quot;    -  :&apos;2.  .   In my Memorandum to the Cabinet of March 27th, I expressed the  Opinion that the Ministry of Food should be relieved of  all responsi-  b*ility in respect of liquor control.  I adhere to  that opinion, but  I feel bound to accede to the suggestion of. the Chancellor  of the  Exchequer that I should lay before the Cabinet the following recommend-  ations, which&apos; are the outcome of the experience of my Department  during  the last two years,it      As regards gravity, I am of opinion that the  average gravity should  be raised to 10400,  I make this recommendation on the following  grounds.       (a) It is, in my.view, clear that the prevalence of low gravity       beer has increased the demand for spirits. I understand that       the Liquor Control Board have passed a resolution to this effect.       (b) An increase in gravity is also desirable  from the point  of       view of duty.  Any materially increased quantity of low gravity       beer will not be consumed.       As regards barrelage,. I recommend that the statutory barrelage  should be increased.to 24,000,000 standard barrels for the following  reasons s.-       (a) This is the least amount, which will enable me to free the       Halting Trade,.- who are now licensed to make on the  ration of      . the datum year,      7(b) 24,000,000 standard barrels represents roughly  the 22,.000,000       contemplated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer together with the       beer issued to meet the special claims of harvesters, of munition       workers and of Clubs; without a datum year.       (c) This figure would represent 75$ of the output in 1916, and  its       adoption would place the output of beer on a  parity with the       delivery of spirits.            I am further of the opinion that the increased output might  take effect from the day on which the Budget is introduced at the same  time as ,the increase of duty,, and need not be divided into two  or  more stages..  This concession would relieve .the Government from  consider-  ing the question of output until the autumn,, when  it will be necessary  to decide whether the trade should or should not be allowed to go free.-            I desire again to emphasize the important effect which  the  adoption of these- proposals would secure in allaying labour unrest,  I have, been in &quot;communication with the Chancellor of the  Exchequer on  the points raised in this memorandum and I understand that he agrees  with the above recommendations.,            I desire also to refer to my memorandum of Marth 27th  recommending that the Ministry of Food shall be relieved of responsibility-  ity in respect of-liquor control,  I yjould urge that an  early decision  to this effect should be given by the War Cabinet,Ministry of Food.     3rd April 1919..GEO.H.ROBERTS.
