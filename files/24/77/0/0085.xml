COMSOIOTIOUS  OBJECTORS EMPLOYED UNDER THE    COSIMITT13B OK WLpIMNT OF CONSCIENTIOUS                 013J1OTORS.(Circulated by the  Home  Secretary).      I should be  glad of  a ruling fron the Cabinet as to the manner in whichthe decision that  conscientious  objectors who have completed two years&apos;.imprisonment are to be released  and discharged from the Army is to be applied in the case of conscientious objectors employed under the Committee on employment of Conscientious Objectors.      TheBe men are divided into two classes      (a) Men who, having  served under the Committee for twelve months ormore with good conduct and industry, have been permitted to take up &quot;exceptionalemployment&quot; *- about 2*900  in number.   These men are to all intents and pur-poses already demobilised.      (b) Men who  have not served 12 months under the Committee or whoseconduct or industry has been bad.   These men number 678, and are employedin groups, chiefly at  Dartmoor.    The tine they have served (including timeserved in prison)  is as follows      Over 2 years   *..

I think it is clear that all the men  in Class  (a) above&apos; should now be discharged.   For all practical purposes  they are already free.      AB regards the men in Class  (b)  two alternative  courses are possible.They may either be released enbloo,  or they may be  released as they completean aggregate of two years&apos; service in  prison and under the Committee.      There are serious objections to  the second course; while in favour ofthe firBt course it should be observed:-      (l) Ac a matter of administration,  it will be  very much more simple todischarge them in this way than to discharge them gradually.      (2) It is reasonable that these  men,  all  of whom have agreed to acceptalternative service should receive somewhat more favourable treatment thanthe men in prison.      (3) I apprehend that, if only  certain categories of the men are released,there will be great difficulty in  retaining control  over.the remainder.

I think it is clear  that all the men in Class (a) above&apos;should now be discharged.   For all practical  purposes they are already free.      AB regards the men in  Class (b) two alternative courses,are possible.They may either be released  en blood, or they may be released as they completean aggregate of two years&apos; service in prison and under the Committee.      There are serious  objeotions to the second course; while in favour ofthe first course it should be  observed;-      (l) As a matter of administration, it will be very much more simple todischarge them in this way than  to discharge them gradually.      (2) It is reasonable that  these men, all of whom have agreed to acceptalternative servioe should receive somewhat more favourable treatment thanthe men in prison.      (3) I apprehend that,  if only certain categories of the men are released,there will be great difficulty in retaining oontrol over the remainder.
The Committee^ control depends on the power  of  recalling individualmen from the Reserve to the Colours.    If that  power  is  not  to  beexercised there will be nothing to prevent all  the men at Dartmoorand elsewhere from going home - a situation which they will  be  quickto realize.      (4) If this course is adopted,  most of  the staff of the 0*0.Department at the Home Office can be  discharged at once.      To release these men at once en bloc would appear to give theman undue preference, but that course  might not  meet with so  muchopposition as would a policy of recalling to the colours .iny men whoabscond from the Committee&apos;s control.      I ask fcr a decision on these questions.7th April,  1919.\
