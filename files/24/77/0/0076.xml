The &quot;Severnaya Kemmuna&quot; of February 25th contains a upeeehmade by Zinoviev at the meeting of the Soviet;.) of the northernProvince.   2inoviev&apos;s speech dealt mainly with the international situation.     &quot;I have juot /received a wireless message from Paris,  whichsets&quot; forth an interviev/ given yesterday by Savinkov to theParliamentary CommisSieh fdr Foreign Affairs of the FrenchChamber of Deputies.   Savinkov tried to frighten the Alliesby telling them that if they do not intervene in Russia then the Germans will cona^uer her.   Savinkov knows very well how to produce an influence on the French bourgeoisie.    But his reference to the Germans now sounds absolutely ridiculous.Germany, a3 you know,  is a Colossus with feet of clay.  More-over, Savinkov tried to excite the French bourgeoisie to con-duct immediately a campaign against Russia,- asserting that other-wise it would be too late.   I think that the time has already-passed.   France will  not find that million men which are  neces-sary for the occupation of Petrograd, or rather, that million which will turn its bayonets against us and not against the Frenchbourgeoisie.   Savinkov asserts that France is popular in  Russia. What I ask is, what France?   And with what Russia?     &quot;The France of the Alliance with the Tsar and the milliardslent to us is not popular.   Another reason why the French bcur-geoisie
geoisie cannot come to&apos;the help  of theirTRusedan-eixmraciej-&quot;Is-^that-the greund. is -already^l3urn,ing--i;iider&apos;their own feet.      &quot;Already amongst many leading bourgeois-politicians a more moderate tendency with regard  to Russia begins to gain the upperhand.&apos;  Even such a leader of  Inglish  Imperialism as Lloyd George,who knows very v/ell on which side the.broad is buttered, hascaught the change in the atmosphere and is showing a rnr;re con-ciliatory attitude towards the Bolsheviks than formerly. i!      Farther, Zinoviev pointed out that Tchitcherin.&apos;e lastltote, which expressed readiness to make concessions towards theAllies, and to pay &quot;interest on loans,  etc., had caused&apos;.a certainamount of..dismay in party circles.   -He considered that  cn thepresent occasion the Soviet Government was fully alive to what it was doing in repeating; the  same policy which&apos;had been adopted.at the conclusion of the Brest Peace,  so as to get a respite,It went without saying that they were  conducting a holy revelu-tionary war.   But every war demanded  enormous sacrifices both  .in men and money.   They were  assured  of victory.   Capitalismwas wounded and mortally.mounded, although perhaps, like a dyingwhale, it v;oulu still be able  to inflict serious blows.   TheSoviet Government was bounr? as far as  possible to save the work-men, peasants and the Anay from those blovs.   They could; without taking alarm, pay the.Allies 20 or even 40 milliards- and give themconcessions, such as,  for example, the building of the Greatnorthern Route.      &quot;It is worth pointing, out that the German,, sa&amp;lish and Prenchworkmen are not inclined to consider that by this, note we have &apos;made such concessions as i-ould compromise Us and tne internationalproletariat.   Le are in constant aid  close relations * ith theGerman Communists and we kno&apos;-- that they approve of our steo.-In Prance,  even Moderate Socialists such as Lrnguet are wholly                                                        en
on our side.     &quot;Our Russian counter-revolutionaries  such as kilyukov, Savin-kov,  and Tchaikoveki,  understand very  veil that  concessions tothe&apos;Allies are purely  of a shaip character.   That is why they,on every occasion,  try to persuade  the Allies not to concludepeace with the Bolsheviks, pointing out  that the Bolsheviks ean-not give any guarantees.    Of course ve  shall not give anyguarantees.&quot;- 3 -
