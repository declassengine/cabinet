EQUIPMENT FOR ROUMANIA.

Note by the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

I circulate to my colleagues, herewith, a memorandum by General Greenly, Head of the British Military Mission in Roumania, relative to the present situition of that country.

I am strongly of opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government should give Roumania some immediate tangible proof that the immense sacrifices which she made in the Allied cause have not been forgotten. Owing to her geographical position the condition, of Roumania is probably worse than that of any other country, which fought on our side. She is, moreover, peculiarly exposed to the Bolshevik danger and she constitutes one of tho few remaining barriers against Bolshevism.

I should like to see an attempt made, within the limit that is immediately possible, to clothe and equip her army and to improve the working of the Roumanian railways, Food supplies are being sent by has Supreme Council of Relief and Supplies, but great difficulty is being experienced in distributing them. Economic reconstruction is, moreover, being retarded owing to the deplorable condition of the railways.

Hitherto the Treasury have not been able to sanction the necessary expenditure to carry out the recommendations contained in General Greenly&apos;s report without a war cabinet decision.

I earnestly trust such a decision may now be taken. The Roumanian Prime Minister came over to London on purpose to see me, in order to plead his Cause. But even before this I had decided to submit General-Greenly1a paper to the Cabinet.

I  inclose fallowing SHORT REPORT Oil THE PEESSBIJT SITUATION                   .  U K0U21AHIA-            .   1,  Tho country is on tho verge of starvation on       account  of  laox of food and clothing;   wore both landed       to-day  in sufficient quantities at &quot;Danube ports and Oonstanza       the  want of tho people would bo little less acuto because       adequate means of. distribution are Inciting *               2.  Means of distribution should consist of       railway transport, river transport and road transport.               Railway Transport;  utterly inadequate at present       but  could be comparatively quioxly and cheaply made       available without for the present calling on supplies of       locomotives from outside Roumania.               Road Transport:  except in Transylvania quite       inadequate:  oxen and forage to xeep them alive are the       chief needs.  Bulgaria and&quot;Bursary have both stolon large       quantities  of oxen and forage, and should be made to       disgorge*               River Transport: The finest inland waterway in       Europe  is available to assist very largely in distribution,       practically no use is made  of it,  Tugs,, barges and lighters       are  available in considerable quantities?.- fuel is laexing       to set  them in motion;  the British Eavy have .several ships       in the Danube which- ere doing nothing.  -The Danube       Commission  is not functioning, the bar at Sulirs. the only &apos;       suitable trade entrance, is much silted up;   ledgers aro       available,  but no fuel and  no river authority.               The Danube Commission should bo reconstituted ,at      -once, and provided with fuel for dredging purposes; , the      -British-Bevy, with Admiralty coal; should be. empowered to ,.,,       perform  tug duty, and run the river (if necessary under       French.orders:) t--.-\-.&quot;&apos;:               3v  Railway Situation. -               This is where tho greatest improvement can be       effected;,  at the. least. .exh:enso:,&apos;- and in the -shortest -time.      .       ;  At  -present&apos; about.&apos;250 locomotives are worxing  mostly       in. a bad. s tato-of repair;  p3rhaps about half of &quot;thoso burn       oil, the remainder chiefly wood, cool being unobtainable in       sufficient  :quantltiesA          .        :  ,  - .     -^           ... . -Just under 800 locomotives ore in the -shops awaiting       /heavy-repairs1.material to repair -and convert to oil-fuel       machines is laekingo               &quot;Gil -in 1 iraitless \qu?nti ties, so far as RoumaniaT s       needs are concerned&apos;, is available&apos;-, it is immobilised owing       to lacX  Of moans of distribution.               Railway repair material is therefore, the most urgent       need;  5,000 tons ( 500,0.00 approximate v^lae ofmaterial)       are  -estimated as sufficient to set things going and       rq die ally change, the - situs t ion for tho be tie r,               4..   Other most went needs:       Pood. (beginning -to&apos; arrive ) v  ;    &apos;  .       Clothing&apos;, especial!./ boots and underwear..
Toolst. such as picks,  shovels,  spades,  hoes,  axes,   saves,  eBelting, for all sorty. of raajfdijnery,              ,Raw Material. cotton and thread, wool.         5.  The country has &quot;been in the&apos;condition indicated above for a long tine; if continued indefinitely, an  ex-plosion is certain; how soon it may come io beyond man&apos;power to predict, but there are ominous  signs that it maynot be far off.  The need for immediate relief is thereforegreat.         So far the peasantry and army have resisted the immense amount of Bolshevist propaganda which has contin-uously attacked the country from three sides; the pro-paganda gains in activity, while the field becomes morefavourable every day.         If the army continues loyally to resist Bolshevistpropaganda, it can avert revolution.  The army, like thecountry, is starving for lack of food and clothing,  andthere must be a limit to its endurance.  It is a smallerthing to relieve the army than th- whole nation; it can  bodone comparatively easily and cheaply and should be begunai once.         roumania cannot save itself and must rely now and ultimately either on France and England or the CentralTowers; before the war it relied on the Central Powers,  and return to the old familiar and efficient channels is perhaps the easiest way.        ^Por the moment, the Central Powers cannot assist,though they are already making overtures.         Prance is probably unable at present to do verymuch; America may step in, otherwise England appearsto have the field open.  -     *         Whatever nation comes forward now will have an immense start, and with energy and up-to-date methods shouldbe able to continue to enjoy most of the trade with Roumania         7. It is worth our while, to save Roumania now,and to do so would certainly be the finest possible invest-ment for the British Empire,         (a)  The Roumanian peasantry are a loyal, honest,industrious and patient race.  Under the new laws they willown nearly all the land of the country.  They appear to be aideal bulwark against the Bolshevism and Teutonism ^hichsurrounds them,  and should be a sheet anchor of democracyin the Hear East.  They are at present strongly anti-Germanand their Civilisation&apos; is that of England and Prance,as against &apos;Kultur&apos;.         (b)  The army is of excellent material; the troops are wonderfully enduring,  and have shown splendid self-sacrifice an... discipline;  the officers have greatly improved and are capable of being turned into good leaders.  If fedand clothed,  now,  it can be relied on to-continue to with?-stand Bolshevism,  and should be a great factor in the main-tenance of peace in the ITear East,(c)  Roumania
         (o) Romania is most anxious to respond to any advance on the  art of Great Britain, and to establish the closest trade and economic relations with us.   Thefield for British commerce is great and the opportunityunique*   If we neglect it? the Central Powers must even-tually pick up what we refuse to take.         (d) The oil fie.. da of Roumania arc better- placed for British purposes than any other in the world; con-cessions in oil should be no great difficulty,, and will almost certainly be made in return for present assistance^        &apos; If concessions are granted, we must, in our own interest, see that Roumania is strong enough to protecther oil supply,         (e) Subject to limitations of armaments generallyas may be eventually decided by the league of Nations,-loumania intends to have a Navy, on the Black Sea,   ItIs In our interests to help her to create it and to seethat it Is for, and not against us*         (8) It seems wise policy.therefore, to assistRoumania at once,   The first steps necessary are:-          1* Railway material as above in paragraph 3.          2* Relief of army from present distress byimmediate supply of:- Boots, sooks, shirts, coats, blanketsequipment, animals, forage (Details supplied elsewhere).         Unless this is done very soon, the army will be quite Incapable of any serious effort, either defensiveor offensive in the present year.   It viay not continue to withstand Bolshevist attemps to seduce It*          3c Relief of country, as in paragraph 4.            90 In view of above, I beg to submit followingdefinite proposals:-      (a) That His Britannic hajostyrs Government give credto Roumanian Government for purchase by M* Zachariadicadvised by Lieutenant Colonel Billinton of railway materialas already selected up to  500,000*      (b) That credit be also given for purchase of Vilitarclothing and equipment, as per list attached.      (c) That a ship be placed at disposal of BritishIJilitary hiss ion to take above, direct to ^roumania, andGeneral Greenly authorised to arrange direct with (^Directorof Shipping)*      (d) That shipfs cargo be completed by addition ofsuch goods m Board of T:.ade consider desirablep and GeneraGreenly be officially put in touch with the Board of Trade,,                             (Sdo) ,/oH.
