53/2/20&apos;6-Confidential,ifite Docr^,,,   .,            -299War CaVlhey-itan  .r:,;;;     &apos;^ S^Tofrip,li-^intfinance of the,Censorship.         MgKQRAiOTM by the Secretary of State for War,.          The War Cabinet decided on February 12th 1919 that      ship should be maintained.   (\7ar Cabinet 631 Minute 6)          Mr, Balfour on February 28th 1919 agreed with theAmerican representative on the Inter-Allied Blockade Committeein Paris to abolish all British censorship of Americantransit messages, and that agreement was put into force from march 12th 1919,   This was not consistent with the WarCabinet decision,  From the moment that the agreement wasantered into it was clear that other Allied countries might take advantage of it in order to  press, for similar facilities to .those granted to the Americans,  In fact this has already occurred, not it is true, at the  instance of -other allied countries, liut again at the instance of the american representatives who have made certain proposals to theSupreme Blockade Council.  These  proposals are in effect thatall British censorship of transit postal or cable communicationsshould cease, and that censorship shall\only be carriedout by the Allied countries of origin or destination, or,in the case of neutral countries, by the first Allied countrythrough which the messages pass.          There is abundant evidence that the Americaneonsorship is &quot;dither unable or unwilling to carry out theoensorship entrusted to it under  the agreement made byMr, Balfour, and referred to above.   Other Allied censorshipsare far less efficient &quot;than the Americans and even if rillingloyally to oo^operate with us in  censorship,, are wholly unableto do so in practice.  The necessary machinery for censorshipdoes not exist in these countries and if it did they havenot the necessary information to  enable them to discern neutralcovers for enemy trade etc.  This information owing otogeographical position is available to no country in the worldexcept the United Kingdom,          The sole object of the  proposals now put forward by the Americans is the avoidance of British censorshipwherever possible, and it cannot  be too clearly Emphasizedthat if those proposals are agreed to the British censorshipwould be the only  censorship enforcing restrictions, andthat these would therefore be operating exclusively against british interests.          The purely military importance of censorship haslargely ceased to exist and the War Office is therefore - not primarily concerned, apart from the fact that the machinery -of censorship is entirely controlled by.the War Offioe.Without expressing any opinion as to the importance, ofmaintaining the  censorship (upon which other Governmentdepartments - and especially.the Treasury - are understood tohold strong^&amp;ews) it cannot be too clearly stated that theacceptance of the latest American proposals would destroy the efficiency of that machinery  completely.  There appearto be but twe alternatives - to maintain the censorship asit is, or to abolish it altogether.  If therefore it  is decided to maintain the censorship at  all, the American, orany similar proposals should be  strongly opposed.28th march ,,1919.
