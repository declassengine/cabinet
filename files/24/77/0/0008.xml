Referred  to       by the Minister of Munitions&apos;^/%emoranii;am/for  Cabinet Committee  on Home Affairs.considered the draft Ministry of Supply &apos;Bill,  and the Cabinet Committee at its meeting on 31st  March     representations were made that tHe Bill as  drafted would     confer on the new Ministry- large pov/ers of  providing  buildings,     and that these powers might lead to encroachment  on the     duties of the Office of V/orks, the local Government Board, etc.     The Committee decided that  the Minister of  Munitions  should     after consultation with the Departments concerned,  redraft     Clause 1 of the Bill to meet this criticism,  and  reconsider     Clause 2 in relation to Clause 1. 2,          The Parliamentary CounSfil advised that  as Clause 1     does not in itself confer any powers on the Minister  of  Supply,     but merely defines in general, terms the purposes  which limit     the exercise by him of any powers conferred by  Clause 2. it was     in the latter clause that the required amendment  should  be     introduced.  Clause 2 has accordingly now been  re-drafted as     shown in the attached revise of the Bill,3.           The alterations made are as follows    . (1)  in order further to restrict the use of theOrder in Council machinery; the administrative powers ofthe Minister of Supply have been defined in general terms in the opening lines of the Clause,  instead of leavingthem to be conferred by His Majesty in Council;  andin order to bring all the references to this machinery in the Bill.into a single Clause, Clauses 3 and 5 of theearlier draft have been made Subsections (2) to (4) of clause 2.     (8) in order to provide against the possibility ofthe Minister of Supply getting an Order in Council made
                      o    transferring to himself tho powers or duties  of another    Government Department without consulting that Department.,    it has been made dear that such an Order can only bo    made if tho transfer is deemed expedient both by the    Minister and by the other Department concerned.         (3)  a proviso has been added to subsection (1)    stipulating that tho powers of the Minister of Supply    in relation to the provision of land, tho erection and    repair of buildings, and the construction and repair    of works, for the purposes of any po?/ers or duties of    any other Government Department which have not been    transferred by Order in Council to the Minister, shall    be exorcised only at the:.requost of that Department.         (4)  words have been added to subsection (2) to    make it clear that an Order in Council providing that    powers transferred from any Government department to the    Ministry of Munitions shall pass to the Ministry of  -  Supply instead of reverting to that Department is only    to be made if doomed expedient both by the Minister    and the Department concerned.         The revise of the Bill embodying tho above amendments of Clause 3 has now beon concurred in by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, the ^Secretary of State for War, the Presidentof the Board of Education, the President of the Board ofAgriculture, and tho first Commissioner of Works (subject toa suggestion made by tho IPirst Lord of tho Admiralty and still under discussion with him that tho proviso under (3)above should apply also to the disposal of lands and structure        A new Clauso has been added (Clause 7) to validateany action taken by the Minister of Munitions in anticipation of the passing of the Bill.
        Tho  Cabinet Committee  also decided  on 31st Maroh that  the Minister of Munitions should draft an alternative to  Clause  A  (now Clause 3 in the revised  draft) and should prepare a memorandum stating  the case for  and against compelling  mamifacturors to disclose their cost of production, which could be discussed when the Committee again considered the draft Bill,  A draft Clauso (which if  adopted should preferably  be a distinct Clause instead of being embodied in  Clause 3) has been prepared, and a memorandum on the question is appended *        Subject to a decision  as to the insertion of this Clause, the Bill is believed  to bo now accepted by all concerned.  There are some important questions still under discussion as regards the scope of the activities of the Ministry of Supply, especially as regards  the provision of aircraft and its equipment and the extent  of the supply functions to  be  taken over from the Admiralty; but these questions do not affect  the form of the Bill itself*                                                 (Sgd.)

  Mi^IQiUIIDUM OH X&apos;HS QUESTION OF        OOMPULSQifl BOWBBS  TO HBQUliiB M^IfJgifcO,OTHEiiSt Etc., TO DISCLOSE! PRODUCTION                          COSTS*     It:   The power . of compelling manufacturers and others to disclose particulars of the cost of producing or acquiringthe artioles which they manufacture or deal in, and to permitthese particulars to be verified in such manner as may be prescribed (including the examination of their boo^s and costrecords) is conferred on certain Departments by the regula-tions made under the Defence of the iioalm Acts, and has provedof the Utmost value during the war in securing the supply ofGovernment requirements on reasonable terms.   It has beensuggested that this power should be continued as a permanentmeasure and that  provision should be made for its exercise inthe Ministry of Supply Bill.     2.   This proposal is supported by the following arguments;-     (a)  It is the only effective means of overcoming oombina-       tions among manufacturers to maintain prices at an       artificially hi^h level.     (b)  This policy of arranging prices in concert has       prevailed in the past as regards certain goods which       were obtainable only from comparatively small groups       of manufacturers, but it: is  possible that it may  be       greatly extended in the near future as a result of the       operation of the &quot;tfhitley Council&quot; system of industrial or-       ganisation.     (o)  Under the //hitley Council system the Government encourager-          rages the formation of associations of employers in          each leading industry,, embraoing as far as possible all          the important members of the industry.   The declared          objoots of these associations are, by co-operation with.          the parallel organisations of the workers and otherwise
    to minimise trade  disputes,,  ensure  greater  harmony  of    working,  better  conditions of  labour, and generally the    improved  organisation of. the industry..   One  result of    thus  fostering common aotion among  manufacturer^    hitherto   in jealous  competition must be to encourage    them  to combine  for the purpose of  arranging,  and no    doubt increasing,  prices.   Such arrangements  are    perfectly justifiable and legitimate up to  a point,, when    directed  against extreme competitive price-cutting, but    there is  a grave danger of their developing into    monopolistic trusts under which the interests  of the    consumer  will be eubor&amp;inatedto the payment of dividends. (d)   Moreover, under the Whitley Council system the    workpeople in eaoh industry  will have a voice  in deter-    mining the price of their product,  and will have a  more    direct interest  than  heretofore in  raising  that price.;    and it is rarely found that&apos;  the labour leaders in any    particular industry resist  increases proposed by manu-    facturers in the selling prices of  its products. (e)    It may possibly be found necessary to devise some    means of protecting the general consumerrs  interests    under this system, but it is urged  that in  any case        Government ought  to be safeguarded from exploitation    by the producers..(f)     The public Accounts Committee of  the House of    Commons has recommended the  continuance of  these powers    in its Report dated 31st July, 1917f.  from which the    following is an  extract:-            &quot;Your Committee feel bound  to add that $ consider            &quot;able advance has been made in this matter  &quot;by            &quot;the powers now conferred on the War  Office,            &quot;Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions,  and Food            &quot;Controller,  of examining contractors books
0            &quot;and fixing prices  on actual coat of production              &quot;plus a percentage  for reasonable profit, and              MJKiey^ jbrust that  toese^^wjsrs^j^ be retained on              &quot;roturii to  normal conditions.&quot;      (g)      It io also  suggested that  the strong effort recently-          made by the Federation of British Industries to get the          Government to  abandon  its right to investigate Costs          was not merely directed against the costing inquiries          of  the  different  Government Departments during the war,          but was a far-seeing attempt  to get the system          abandoned and  prevent  its being continued in times of          peace,  and that the  bitterness of the opposition to          the power from trade quarters is a measure of the          necessity of maintaining it,          3.   The arguments that may be urged against the   proposal to perpetuate these  special powers are :      (a)    -  that even if there  is a case for their exercise          in war  time, there is  no reason why under normal          peace conditions  the Government1s purchases should          have any preferential  treatment, as compared with          those of the ordinary  private consumer.      (b)      that the obligation to disclose costs of production          is vexatious and  involves inquisitorial investigations          by  Government  inspectors.      (c)      that the powers themselves are nugatory unless          accompanied by a  power to compel manufacturers to          supply  at prices  which the investigation of costs          shows to be reasonable, since it would otherwise          still be open  to  firms to refuse to undertake          Government orders except on their.own terms.   As          against this it is urged that publicity and the          resulting pressure of  public  opinion would be a          sufficiently powerful  weapon  to overcome any
            resistance on the part 3f msnufacturera; but thia            implies that power would be taken not only to            require disclosure  of costs of production, hut also.            if so decided to make public the particulars so            disclosed.   This would be going beyond the practice            which has obtained during the war, as the Defence of            the Realm Regulations provide for any particulars            disclosed being treated as strictly confidential.   To            place manufacturers in the position of being compelled            to give access to their costs of production both to trade            rivals in this country and to foreign customers and            competitors would undoubtedly bo strenuously resisted as            a serious grievanoe and a severe handicap to trade, and            it is doubttul whether such a provision oould be oarried            in Parliament.     4.   On the whole it seems inadvisable to introduce acontentious element into the Ministry of Supply Bill by includingthe power to require disclosure of production-costs, but a clause (copy attached) has been drafted for use in case it is thought desirable to take thie opinion of the House of Commons by havingthe question raised by way of amendment to the bill   It willbe noticed that under th* Clauso as drafted (a) the power is limited to cases where the Minister of Supply is satisfied that owing to the absence of reasonable competition it is not practicable to secure supply at a reasonable price; and (b)that while disclosure, &quot;except as authorised by the Ministerof Supply&quot;, of information obtained under this power ispunishable as&amp;misdemeanour,   there is no, obligation of secrecyimposed on the Minister himself, so that it is open,to him touse the weapon of publicity if he things proper.   As pointedout above, it is doubtful whether Parliament would agree togive the Minister such a discretionary power of disclosure,but without it the whole provision seems likely to proveineffective,
