it this  document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government. . r M                                                                 -     -^57SECRET.BOLSHEVISM  IN  GERMANY.0154&quot;I circulate to  the Cabinet an Interim Report by an officer recently returned from berlin on the results of an investigation into the influence and growth of Bolshevism   4604in Germany.                                                 WINSTON  S.  CHURCHILL.   10th April, 1919.,    1. In the  course of my investigation two sources of information were employedby me :     (a.)  The official reports, both secret and public, of the Landgericht Department,           which deals with Spartacist and Bolshevik questions under &quot; Staatsanwalt-           schaftsrat&quot;  Dr.  R.  Weismann.   This  official, who rendered, me  every           assistance in his power,  placed all the records of his office at my disposal,           and extracts and copies of the more important of these will be translated           and embodied in my final report.    (b.)  The second and more valuable source of information was the conversation  and           opinion of  individual Germans on the subject of Bolshevism, and I have           had the opportunity of  hearing the views of all classes and walks of life.               When dealing  with the  poorer classes,  I represented &apos; myself as  a         &apos;  German-American, recently returned from 4 years&apos; internment in  England,           who had  left Germany for  the  States  at  the  age  of 12  and had  not           returned since, thus explaining my  incorrect  German  and foreign  accent,           and thereby getting at  their real thoughts and opinions.    2. Investigation  into  the  official documents  and  reports goes  to  prove  thatBolshevist  activity is  steadily  on  the  increase throughout the  country ;  agents are becoming more  numerous and more  open in their methods, and, further, a steady streamof forged notes are pouring  into the country, which are  known to be of Bolshevistorigin, but  whose source has not  as yet been traced.  The Government officials arehandicapped in their  dealings with this movement  in two ways.  Firstly, the abolitionof secret police  has made it very difficult to obtain either reliable or early information ;secondly, the smaller  police officials are unwilling  to  do their duty in the matter ofarrests and search, by reason of their distrust of the present Governments position, ;mdthe fear  that the. man whom they arrest one day may be in power the next.    3. Conversation with individual Germans, of whatever class and station,  all go to confirm the  opinion that the danger of Germany embracing Bolshevism is both real andimminent.   Among the poorer classes,  more especially  the small shopkeeper and thelower Government official, whose earnings and salaries have remained stationary, therenow exists a feeling of apathetic despair.  The poorer  classes of Berlin  are literallystarving, and at present see no hope of improvement either in  food or labour conditions,except such as are conveyed by Bolshevist propaganda, backed up by the distribution offorged notes.  The hopes of improved conditions held  out by the Ebert-ScheidemannGovernment months ago have not materialized,  and they are  willing to listen  to  anyother suggestions and promises of bettering their circumstances, more particularly whenthose are backed up by free  gifts of money.  There is no sense  or logic in their reasoning,and ona  must not look for sense or  logic from starving men or women, for starving theyliterally  are ; even those who know what the results of Bolshevism have been in Russiaare content  and accept those results in Germany as  a prelude to the promised improve-ment.   The general cry is :  &quot; things cannot possibly be  worse  than  they are now,  andany change  must be a change for the better.&quot;    4. Amongst the richer classes,  although naturally the infection is not so  widespread,nor the danger so imminent, there  are distinct signs of wavering.  This I believe to bedue to their uncertainty and mistrust as to the future.(B19/18n  60  4/19  E&amp;S, 7038wo
     It will be convenient to divide those into two classes :      (i.) The professional classes, Government officials, &amp;c.     (ii.) The commercial and industrial classes and employers of labour.          &apos;  &apos;, .-     (i.) With  regard to the first of these, the Government retained most of  thepermanent officials in the various departments, and  those  are  and have been workingloyally for the Government.  But they are  disheartened by their uncertainty as to thefuture, and, as already pointed out, the failure of their subordinates to co-operate.     (ii.) The commercials and  industrials are naturally influenced by a desire to  savetheir business and manufacturing concerns from impending disaster, and are beginninghalf to consider the necessity of throwing in their lot with the Bolshevists in order todo so.   Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Councils are being set up by the workmen in privately-owned factories, &amp;c, all  over the  country, and their owners are  naturally consideringthe advisability of keeping in with their employers.     5. Throughout the whole of the  richer and upper classes there seems  to exist the fixed idea that the Entente is ruthlessly bent on annihilating Germany and of renderingher financially, commercially and morally impotent, not only  for years but for ever.With this in their minds, they cannot at present see any hope for the future at all, andalthough in the main they hate  and fear  the idea of a Bolshevist  Germany, yet dis-trusting the strength of the present Government, and awaiting daily its downfall, they are beginning almost to resign themselves to a Bolshevised Germany in the near future.   ,  6. To remedy this state  of affairs, and to combat the ever-increasing  influence of bolshevism, I believe it  necessary to  give  the German people  some  hope  of  futuresecurity and of at least a partial recovery.     Supplies of  food (with  a guarantee  of equitable distribution to  defeat SchleichHandler (illicit traders), and the import of sufficient raw materials to enable factories tore-opeu and so relieve the out-of-work problem), are of course  the first essentials to alleviate the existing distress and discontent.  But these of themselves are not sufficient.Bolshevist  leaders and  agents are holding  out false promises of an earthly paradise,which has gripped the imagination of a diseased and starving people, and some counter-attraction in the shape of an assured future, however limited and subordinated, must heshown to them if those promises are not to succeed.
