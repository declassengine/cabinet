The Provisional Committee, appointed at the National Industrial Conference of the 27thFebruary, has completed its report.  The report is being issued to the press, in order thatit may receive full consideration before the adjourned conference  on  the 4th April.  Itis hoped by the members of both sides that they will be able to commend it to the repre-sentatives of the important industrial groups not represented on the committee ;  whetherthey succeed in  this or  not, the large measure of agreement they have reached among themselves should do much to relieve the tension in the industrial field.    The  Report is  a unanimous  report,  and  contains  important  recommendations on  the  legislative  regulation *of   working  hours  and  wages,  on  the   methods of negotiation  between  employers  and workpeople,  on provision  for unemployment,and  on   the  establishment  of  a permanent  representative  National  IndustrialCouncil.  The Trade Union representatives on the Committee submitted a long statement on the causes and remedies of industrial unrest, which ranges far  beyond the scope of theCommittee&apos;s actual  deliberations.  It elaborates, indeed, a  complete  social programme,while the  committee confined its discussions almost entirely  to the  industrial relation(C 1721) 140  3/19  HAS
                                          2of employment and the incidents of that relation.  No counter-statement,: however, wasattempted by the employers ;  it was agreed that the Labour statement should be printedwithout modifications as  an appendix;  and the  practical  spirit that characterised theactual discussions affords  some guarantee that the more limited proposals in the body ofthe report will, if adopted, have the&apos;whole-hearted co-operation of Labour.     From the point of view of the Government, the recommendations of the Committeefall  under two heads, those which involve legislation and  those which  do not.  Underthe former head come most of the recommendations in wages and hours.    .   &apos;     The Committee recommend a legal  maximum 48-hour  week.   They propose that itshould  apply to all occupations, but that provision should be made for varying the legalmaximum to meet the special conditions of  particular trades, and for  exempting par-ticular  occupations  or conditions.   Such  variations  or  exemptions would be made byOrder;  where agreement is reached by representative bodies of  employers  and work-people, the Secretary of State or other Minister should make the Order forthwith ;  where no such agreement is reached, inquiry by an independent  authority is  proposed beforethe  Secretary, of State issues an  Order.  Overtime should be subjected to definite re-restrictions drawn up by a similar procedure.  Thus  a universal restriction of working  hours would  be  established, subject  to  such  provision  as must  necessarily be made  for  con-tinuous processes,  repair-work and  occupations  like  domestic service, in  which the regulation of hours is administratively  impracticable,  and relief  must be given in theform of so many days&apos; or hours&apos; leave in the week.                         ;  \     Legal minimum time-rates for all occupations are also recommended, but the machinery for giving effect to the principle is different.  A Commission is  to be appointed to report within  three months what the rates are to be. and  how they  are to  be brought into opera- tion.   The intention of  the Committee is that there  should be a universal minimum for men, another for women, and  others possibly for juveniles :  but the terms of reference of the &quot;proposed&apos;Commission would allow of some variation and modification to meet the difficulties of particular  trades.  A rapid extension of Trade Boards in the meantime is recommended, and a revision of the Trade Boards Act to accelerate procedure in establishing. newminima. V                &apos;   -         -                                .-&apos;&apos;-))&apos;..!&apos; To&quot;; meet the  immediate problem of expiring  war wages and bonuses, the extension for another six months of the Wages (Temporary Regulation)  Act is recommended, and the utilisation of the time so  afforded, to establish new inclusive  rates by the existing machinery for negotiating wages changes where possible, or by special conferences convened by the  Department where such machinery does not exist, and in the last resort by referenceto the  Interim Court of Arbitration.                                  -.....    &apos; In connection with both minimum  rates and maximum  hours it  is proposedr that agreement between representative bodies of employers and workpeople in any trade should be given, the force of law, a proposal hitherto opposed by the Trades Union Congress:     The most important recommendations not involving legislation  are concerned with unemployment and  Avith the  National  Industrial Council.  Organised  short time,&apos;theSfestiuctibiiof overtime, the adjustment of public contracts to compensate for the fluctua- tions in employment on private work, an acceleration of the Governments Housing  pro- gramme, and the utilisation of the machinery of Joint Industrial Councils for the considera- tion of the problem industry by industry, are the remedies for unemployment on which the Committee was able to agree.  On the  form that the provision for maintenance during unemployment should take, which might involve new legislation, agreement was not reached, the Labour representatives demanding a non-contributory scheme, the employers preferring the present scheme in principle, with a higher rate of benefit.     The National Industrial Council is  perhaps the  most novel proposal in the report;(Certainly it is the one the results of which are most difficult to forecast. It is to be a large body, two hundred a side, with a standing Committee  of fifty  to secure continuity. Its functions  are to be  advisory,  but a full-time Chairman of the standing Committee is-demanded.,,  The members of the provisional Committee in their discussions  constantlyinsisted on the importance of the Government acting  on the advice of the representatives of the  people actually engaged in industry,  and  this permanent Council is intended tofacilitate and ensure such regular consultation.  They were  also quite prepared to take alarge part of the responsibility for dealing with industrial disputes on their own shoulders, but limited the proposed Council to advisory functions in order that it should not overlapjthe existing machinery of Trade Unions, Employers&apos; Associations, and Conciliation Agree-jnents in particular trades.  The precise methods by which the Council will bring an effectiveinfluence to bear on important industrial disputes is hardly, however^ made clear.
                  PART II. DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.Unemployment among Demobilised Men.    Owing to the large  numbers of men now demobilised the number of ex-service menunemployed has rapidly increased, though there  has been no proportional increase  ofunemployment in this class.  During the earlier stages of the scheme, among those entitledto policies as members of the Forces, the only classes who were likely to claim the out-of-work donation were those discharged before the armistice, and those who had been engaged on munition or other Government work at home.    Current statistics, however, cover a wider field, including in  addition to men discharged ,before the armistice the whole of themen about  a million and a half in number demobilised to the 13th February, whosefour weeks&apos; furlough with pay has expired.  It is probable that the increase in unemploy-ment among demobilised men is  now affecting mainly the late serving soldier or sailor.    From the 10th January to the 7th February the number of policies remaining lodgedat the employment Exchanges for men of His Majesty&apos;s Forces increased from 31,500  to53,000, a rise of less than 22,000 in four weeks.  The number then began to rise rapidly.On the 14th February it had increased to 84,000, a rise  of a third of the previous week&apos;total.   In the following week the number increased by over 48,000, in the week ending the28th February by 33,000, in the week ending the  7th March  by over 35,000, and  in theweek ending the 14th March by 35,000.   The total on the  14th March stood at a little under236,000.   In the month from the 14th February to the 14th March, therefore, the numbers unemployed nearly trebled among members of the Forces, increasing by over 151,000.    A revision of the statistics  of  demobilisation  from  the three Forces shows that thetotal number demobilised up to the 20th March amounts to approximately 2,219,000,  ofwhom a little over 63,000 are officers.  There remain to be demobilised from the Armyand the Royal Air Force a number estimated at  962,000, of whom 75,000 are officers.The rate of demobilisation is still declining considerably, the number released during theweek  ending  the 20th March being only 109,000.   Within a comparatively short time,however, 887,000 additional men will enter the field of  employment from the Army andAir Force, excluding those to be demobilised from the  Navy.General Unemployment.    Unemployment is still increasing.   The total number of policies lodged on  the 14thMarch for the United Kingdom was. in round numbers, 988,600, showing a decline duringthe week of 3,600.  This decline, however,  cannot be taken as any indication  of an im-provement in economic  conditions.  It  is due entirely to the  changes which  have been effected in the unemployment donation scheme. Thus, it is necessary in the first place,  to offset a decline of 34,000 in the case of Ireland, owing to the operation of the revised schemefor the donation in that country.  Excluding Ireland, the  number of policies remaininglodged in Great Britain rose  in  the week by over  30,000,  and the proportion of policieslodged to the sugar-buying population stood on the 14th  March at 240 per 10,000, as corn-pared with 194 on the 14th February.   But in this case  also allowance must be made forrecent revision.of the donation system in the case of those holders of civilian policies whohave exhausted the original period of payment.  Up to the 7th March nearly 41,000 policieshad expired.  Of these only about 10,800 have been renewed, the remainder lapsing finallyor being still under consideration.  The greater part of  the remaining 30,000 would still under the old system have appeared as &quot; remaining lodged at the employment exchanges.&quot;    Further evidence  as to the continued increase in unemployment is afforded by thenumber of workers on the live register of the Exchanges.   The total on the 14th Marchwas 1,118,500 as compared with 1,075,900 on the 7th March, and 1,036,800 on  the 28thFebruary.   The total number  of applicants for  employment remaining on  the live register therefore increased during the week ending the  14th March by 4 per cent,  ascompared with 3&apos;8 percent,  in  the previous week.   .    The decline achieved during the week as regards civilian policies by  the alterationseffected in the  unemployment  donation  scheme does little  more than counterbalancethe increase of policies lodged by unemployed demobilised men.Extension of Unemployment Donation.    A preliminary investigation of applications for the extension of donation in caseswhere the original  period of  payment is exhausted gives the following results:      (i) A little over 70&apos;7 per cent, of the men&apos;s policies were the subject of applications          for extension. This has so far been refused only in 3&apos;i per cent, of the total          expiring.  In 38&apos; 9 per cent,  the application has been granted, and in 28; 7          per cent, the cases are still awaiting decision.    (C 1721)                                                               A  2 .&apos;.
     (ii) In the case of women  whose policies have expired, only 41&apos; 7 per cent,  have           applied for an extension.  Extension has been refused in 4*0 per cent, of the           total cases&apos;of expiration.   An extension has been granted in  12&apos;7  per  cent,           of tho cases, and 24&quot;4 per cent, are still awaiting decision.     (iii) The percentage of renewed applications in the case of juveniles is 55 ;  extension           has been refused in 2&apos; 2 per cent, of the total cases, granted in 12&apos; 2 per cent,,           and 40&apos; 6 per cent,  of the total cases are still undecided.     It  will be noted, therefore,  that the  revised scheme is  automatically  eliminatinga considerable number of applicants for donation.  Unwillingness to apply for extensionis due  no doubt in part to the greater stringency of the qualifications required, but thedecline  arises also  from the fact that the reduced scale  of donation is inducing applicantsto accepu work which  hitherto they would have refused.PART III. LABOUR AND  SOCIALIST  PRESS.                                 (A) Peace Conference.     There  are  renewed  complaints in  the Labour Press at the  &quot; reversion to secret diplomacy&quot; at the Peace  Conference;  public  sessions have  practically ceased, despite the promise that secret sessions should be in a minority.   To this secrecy the growing  irresponsibility &quot; of the demands of the Poles,  Jugo-Slavs, and  Belgians, is ascribed. On  the  question  of the  Blockade,  a  certain cleavage of Labour opinion is discernible. To  the  &quot; Herald &quot; the policy of iC starving Germany into submission &quot;  to peace terms which have no relation to the fourteen points appears as  a piece of  &quot; blackguardly brutality.&quot;   The famine  conditions of Central  Europe  are graphically described by  the . HeraldAs &quot; special correspondent at Vienna, who sums up the situation as a lock-out of the workers of Central  Europe by our  Capitalists another move in the game to capture the  world&apos;s markets and appeals to  &quot;  our so-called proletariat,  which believes,  or says it believes,  in the Brotherhood of the Workers,&quot; to demand the raising of the Blockade. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; has a special &quot; Raise the Blockade &quot; number, in which it deplores the  effects  of the Blockade in diminishing the flow of raw materials into industries of Lancashire, Yorkshire and  Belfast.  The removal  of General Plumer to  Malta after  his outspoken comment on the starvation of Germany, is  thought  by the &quot; Call &quot; to have a sinister significance.  &quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand,  fears that famine conditions (for which disorganisation and  lack of transport  are at least as effective a  cause  as  actual shortage of food) are being  exploited in the interests of commercialism and  political reaction.     President Wilson&apos;s refusal to separate the scheme for a League of Nations from  the preliminary draft of a general peace  is  applauded by the &quot; Herald,&quot; which regards  the obstructionist attitude of American politicians as a mere  party dodge,  but &quot;Justice&quot; thinks the  Presidents &quot; dictatorial &quot; attitude  quite  unjustified,  and  his &quot; ill-advised scheme for his nebulous League &quot; a secondary matter which can comfortably wait.  There is a similar divergence of  opinion about Russia.   To  the &quot; tlerald &quot; it displays &quot; the first great  socialist government,&quot; and is at present the  &quot;real issue&quot; of the Peace Con- ference,  but the organs of  Mr. Blatehford and Mr. Hyndman, as  well as the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; are at  pains to expose the &quot;  mischievous fallacies &quot;of Bolshevism and its incon- sistency  with true socialist doctrine.   The  last-named paper, indeed,  repeats  the dis- credited  assertion about  the  Bolshevist decree with regard to women,  which has been withdrawn,  to the satisfaction of the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; by the writer who first gave it currency.     Indignation is pretty general, however, at the refusal to give passports to Messrs.Ramsay  Macdonald and  Roden Buxton for a first-hand investigation into the state  of affairs in Russia.  By the  Bolsheviks,  it is pointed  out, they would be -received with anything but cordiality.  The soundness of Italian claims in Albania and Dalmatia is strongly  impugned by &quot; Justice,&quot; and  it argues that if conceded they will tend ultimately to restore and strengthen Germany&apos;s  economic  hold on  the Balkans.  Caustic comments are made upon  the comparative strength of the military establishments  allotted to Ger- many  and set up in England, where, it is asserted, the burden of armaments, heavier per  head even  before the war than  in  any other  European nation, is  being increased five-fold.
                                  (B)  Foreign Affairs.   &apos;     The unrest in  Etjypt evokes some comment  in the Labour press.  The failure to summon the Legislative Assembly, even now that the armistice has been  signed ;  the dismissal of a Minister who showed independence ;  and the refusal of the British Govern- ment to give a formal hearing to the grievances of the Nationalists are cited as the ultimate causes of the recent rioting.                                                       1     In America the trial of Victor Berger and his fellow Socialists is made the subject of trenchant criticism.   In India the lack of suitable measures to combat the very serious famine, and the passing  of two new Sedition Acts, are pilloried by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and others.                                 (C) Home  Affairs. Goal Industry Commission.     The Labour press has little but  the most  general comments to  give on  this subject. There is general rejoicing at the evidence that within the Labour movement itself, the old &quot; commodity &quot; view of Labour and the worship of property are passing into oblivion, as well as at the publicity the Commission has afforded to  facts hitherto little known or merely guessed at. Transport Bill.     The Transport Bill  receives scant measure of attention, but on the whole it is wel- welcomed as a &quot; step in the right direction,&quot; and the withdrawal of the &quot; Orders in Council &quot; procedure is strongly applauded. The Rent Restriction Bill.     The Rent Restriction Bill is described as &quot; nugatory &quot; because (a) it fails to penalise the collection of &quot; key money &quot; from prospective  tenants, and (b)  it allows too high  a maximum on the increase of rents. The Police.     The interests of the police, it is  maintained, are identical with those of Labour and the concessions which have been granted with a view to obscuring this identity will never meet the case.  Full recognition must come.  &quot;Justice&quot;  scents a  danger  of the mili- tarisation of the English police ; if this be so, it adds, &quot; Trade Unionists who have fought in the war  had better arm themselves at once.&quot; Unemployment.    There is much  vigorous criticism of the existence  of nearly  a  million  unemployed at the present moment.  For this the Blockade is believed to he largely  responsible. Lancashire, for example, used to sell four-fifths  of her output&apos;abroad.   In certain districts of the textile trades this is said to be the worst period of unemployment since 1914.   The reduction of the Unemployment Benefit at such a moment  is bitterly attacked. Ministry of Food.    Mr.  H. M. Hyndman publishes in  &quot; Justice &quot;  an appreciation of the  work of food control.  Prices would have been  vastly higher, he maintains, and. profiteering much more rampant  if control had not been  exercised.   He deplores the  suggestion that the Ministry of Food may be dispensed with and its functions divided between other depart- ments which could not possibly exercise effective  single control; but Mr.  Joe Terrett, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; quotes figures designed to prove that the British meat consumer was fleeced in the interests of Chicago, and that almost the whole meat ration might have been supplied at home. Ministry of Health.    In the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; appears a plea on behalf  of the Standing Joint Committee 6t Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations  for the formation under the Ministry of Health of a body parallel in functions to the &quot; Consumers&apos; Council,&quot; representing those most likely to be affected by the activities of the Ministry, and particularly women. National Shipyards.    The  &quot; British Citizen &quot;  deplores  the  &quot; self-distrust&quot; implied  in the refusal of the Trade  Unions and Co-operative Societies  to entertain  the project for  experimentallytaking over some  of these public works.    (C1721)                                                               A3
Other.     There is a general refusal in the Labour papers to accept without modification theword &quot; production &quot;  as the &quot; mot d&apos;ordre &quot; of the hour.  Before co-operation  in thenational task of production can be achieved snobbery and class  distinctions must go,and production must be for national and not for private gain.     Sir Leo  Money, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;  points out that Socialism  is a policy ofproduction and  not merely of distribution, and he cites the wastefulness in production,resulting  from the inequalities  of income, as one of the strongest  indictments  of theexisting system.  The &quot; basic principles &quot; formulated by the Committee ot Employers andEmployed, meeting under the presidency  of Lord Balfour of Burleigh,  are  ridiculed asinvolving the &quot; fallacy &quot;. of treating Capital and Labour as  compatible  terms.  Mr.Blatchford thinks Socialism is at  last coming into its own, and regrets that at such a mount  it should be polluted with  the  &quot; sophistries &quot; of pacifism, free trade and Bol-bolshevism.                 (2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.     Unemployment (Manchester). The  &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (19th March)  reportsthat over 6,000  ex-service men are in receipt of out-of-work donation in the Manchesterdistrict;   these form probably half the number of men on the unemployed  register.  Acertain  amount of unemployment is due to the men&apos;s conviction  that an attempt isbeing made to exploit  their labour.  A meeting of unemployed ex-service  men, calledby  the Discharged Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos;  Federation, was held  on the 18th  March.  Aresolution was passed protesting against female  labour in  Government offices,  on thegrounds that the women were doing men&apos;s work,  and were responsible for  &quot; the chaoswhich prevails &quot; in Government offices.    Agricultural Labour. The &quot;Liverpool  Post&quot; (19th. March) reports that at a meetingof the Ormskirk War Agricultural Executive Committee, it was stated that of the 169,599agricultural labourers demobilised since the armistice, not  more  than half have returnedto the land.   They are said to go into factories, where &quot; dilutees &quot; are turned  out to make room for them.                              PART IV. (1) GENERAL.National Industrial Conference.     The draft report of the Committee  appointed by  the  National. Joint IndustrialCouncil to &quot;inquire into hours, wages, unemployment and the prevention of  strikes, Avasconsidered at  a meeting  of  the  full Committee  on Wednesday, the 26th March.   Asummary of its provisions appears  in Part I of this Report.Demands of the Triple Alliance Miners.     On the afternoon of 20th March three reports from the Coal Commission were laidbefore the House of Commons.   The Miners&apos; Report  was substantially identical withtheir original demands, namely, an advance of 30 per cent,  on present earnings apartfrom war wage ;  the substitution  of 6 for 8  in the 8-Hours&apos; Act (Coal Mines RegulationAct,  1908),  with a corresponding  reduction  for  surface workers;   that Nationalisationshould in principle be conceded  at once, and that the miners&apos; claims with regard to De-mobilisation should be dealt with  along  with the cases  of men in other industries.   the mine owners offered (1) an advance  of Is. 6rf. a day for persons 16 years of age and upwardsand of H. per day for persons below 16 years; (2) the substitution of &apos;7 for 8 in the 8-Hours&apos; Act from the 1st July and an 8-hour  day for surface workers ;  the question  of nationalisation  was excluded from the scope of  their Inquiry,  and no  judgment on itwas pronounced.   The Report signed by Mr.  Justice Sankey and the  three independent members of the  Commission  appointed by the  Government  on the mine owners&apos;  sidehas  been adopted by the  Cabinet.     On the questions of wages and hours the terms include :-     (1) The substitution of &quot; seven &quot; for  &quot; eight&quot; in the clauses limiting the  hours  of           work underground  in the Eight Hours&apos; Act as from the 16th July, 1919, and          subject to the economic position&apos;of the industry, &quot; six &quot; as from the 13th July,          1921.   Certain adjustments to be made in the hours of certain classes of under-          ground workers specificially mentioned in the Act;     (2) 46^ hours&apos; working week, exclusive of meal times,  for surface workers,  from           the 16th July, 1919 ;     (3) An increase of 2s. per shift worked or per day  worked  for  underground  and           surface workers whose wages have in the past been regulated by Colliery Sliding           Scales.  In the case of  workers  under 16 years of age  the advance is to he Is.
     It is stated that it had been estimated that these recommendations would involve aI distribution of an additional sum of  30,000,000  among mine workers, but that it was; believed that they could be put into operation without raising the price  of  coal  to  theI consumer.   As to control, the report stated that &quot; even upon evidence already given, the present system of ownership stands condemned &quot; ; and that the signatories were prepared to report now that &quot; it  is to the interest of the country that the colliery worker should have an effective voice  in the direction of the mine.&apos;&apos;     As regards Housing, the report stated that &quot; it is a matter for careful  consideration whether a penny per ton should not at once be collected  on  coal  raised,  and applied  to improve the housing and amenities of each  particular colliery district.  A penny per ton on our present output means about  1,000.000 a year.&quot;     The report  also states that interim reports  ought  to be issued.   These are to con- tain suggestions as to the different ways in which economies and improvements in the coal industry can be effected.  It is suggested that these reports be issued at short intervals, in order that  a scheme for the  reconstruction&apos; of  the industry may be started at once. After due trial, it would be seen whether the suggestions are worthy of being permanently adopted in the Act of Parliament which must eventually be sought to secure the reorganisation - sation of the industry.     On Friday the Miners7 Federation considered these reports, and on Saturday afternoon Mr.  Bonar  Law,  representing  the  Government,  met the  Executive  Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation, to discuss their proposals for the modification of Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s report, and also to discuss the interpretation of certain clauses in the report. Mr. Bonar Law then consulted with Mr. Justice Sankey, and having come to definite agreement with him as to the exact meaning which the clauses in the report were intended to convey, with the Minister of Labour he met the miners&apos; leaders on Tuesday, the  25th.  At  this  conference Mr.  Bonar  Law&apos;s reply on behalf of the Government was to the effect that while the Government were anxious to do everything to meet the men, they could  not go outside the terms of the report.  On a number of points Mr. Bonar Law was able to satisfy Mr. Smillie at once ; others, mainly points of minor detail, he suggested could be settled  by discussion with Sir Richard Redmayne.  Mr.  Smillie, in his reply, did not  seriously  challenge the position taken up by Mr. Bonar Law on behalf of the Government.   In  the  course of the discussion the miners&apos; representatives were assured that the recommendations contained in the report would be retrospeptive to the 9th January.  A report  of  this conference  was issued to the Press.     The Government proposals were laid before the Miners&apos; National Conference by the Executive Committee on  the 26th March.  The Executive Committee  recommended the Conference to agree to a ballot upon the proposals, with a strong recommendation in favour of acceptance, and after  some  discussion the National Conference by an overwhelming majority agreed to this course.  The ballot is to be held on  the 9th and  10th  April,  and the result will be reported to another National Conference on the 16th April. Colliery Surface Workers.     Though the National Council of Mine Workers other than Miners is not a  member of the Triple Alliance, its activities were stimulated by the Coal Commission, and Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s report contained a recommendation as to surface workers&apos; hours.  A  deputation from the Council saw Sir David Shackleton and Sir Richard Redmayne on the 26th March, to lay before them certain grievances.  The deputation were  advised that the Government were not going beyond the report of Mr. Justice Sankey ; that, in so far as the points which they raised were interpretations of that report,  they should be  referred to Sir Richard Redmayne along with the other questions of interpretation  which had been raised,  and Sir Richard would report  to the Government.  The points raised by the deputation upon which the Royal Commission had not reported, they were informed, were matters which were still sub judice,  and upon which the further report of  the  Commission should be awaited.  The Council would have an opportunity of putting their case.  The deputation appeared to be satisfied with the explanation, and asked Sir Richard Redmayne to see them at an early date. Hailwaymen.     On Friday, 21st March,  the  Governments  offer which  had been announced  the previous night was  rejected by a special delegate meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen,  but a meeting of the Triple Alliance the same  night decided that a sub- committee of the Alliance together with the Negotiating Committee of the  Union should wait upon the Government next morning.  On Saturday morning, accordingly, Mr. Bonar Law  saw the deputation, and  as  a result further conferences took place between  the
  Negotiating Conmittee of the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society  of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and Sir A. Stanley, Sir R. Home, Sir A. Geddes  and the Railway Executive Committee,- on  Saturday and  Sunday.  Reports of the Con.  ferences  were issued  to  the Press.   A  noticeable point  about  the interview was the  prominence which the question of the shopmen received, i.e., the  men in the railway wor.  shops who are only partly covered by the National Union of Railwaymen, the remaindei  belonging mostly to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.  The position of these niei.  has always been a bone of contention  between the NationalUnion of Railwaymen andth  craft Unions, and the fact that no single  organisation is competent  alone  to  represen  them at once puts difficulties in  tlie way of Governmental  negotiation with regard ti  them.  In the course  of  the Conference  Mr. Bonar Law outlined  the main heads of tin  Governments final concessions.  On Monday these were the subject of further negotii  tion at  the  Board of Trade regarding  specific  interpretation,  and  an agreement  \yi  finally arrived at, including the following provisions :       (1) The  standard  week&apos;s work to consist of 48 hours.   The standard  week&apos;s wags            exclusive of any payment for overtime or Sunday duty to be guaranteed to a            employees  who are available for duty throughout the week.   The guarantee!            day to be further considered.      (2) Overtime to be paid at the rate of time and a quarter.      (3) Sunday duty to be paid at the rate of time and a half.      (4) Night Duty (week-days):  All ordinary time worked between 10 p.m. and 4 ail            to be paid at the rate  of  time  and. a quarter; all overtime worked betweei            10 p.m. and 4  a.m. to be paid at the rate of time and a half.      (5) In regular duties 12 hour.-/ rest, in others  a minimum of 9 hours.      (6) One  week&apos;s holiday, with pay,  after 12 months&apos; service.      (7) The Negotiating Committees of the two Unions to be recognised as the medium fo            dealing with all questions affecting rates of pay and conditions of service wM            the present negotiations are proceeding.               A Committee  to be appointed to  consider and report (l) as to the setting            up of a Joint Committee to deal with questions as to wages and condition;            service; (2) as to the continuance, or  otherwise, of the  existing  Conciliation            Board, the proposed Ministry of Ways and Communications is to provide  foi            the co-operation of the workers.     (8)  The present wages to  be stabilised  till the 31st December,  1919, and any reductioi            of  the  war wages under the  Agreement of November, 1918, to be waived            Negotiations to be continued  for fixing new  standard rates for all  worker            throughout the country.   The whole situation to  be reviewed at the end of the            year.     (9)  Other items on tha programme  to be discussed at further  meetings.     The Agreement is subject to ratification by delegate meetings of the  two Unions, Mr.  J. H. Thomas issued a statement  from Unity House  on  the 24th  in which  hi said that the greatest difficulties in the way of a settlement arose from differences betweei the Unions themselves, not from differences between the Unions and the  Governmen He appealed to the railwaymen to exercise a disposition to face facts, and a sense of responsi bility to the country.   It is possible that this statement had reference to the question of tin shopmen, already referred  to.                -                      .     The negotiations referred  to in the  Agreement were resumed on 26th March. Transport  Workers.     Dock and Waterside Workers. Agreement has been come to between  the Nations Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the representatives of  employers throughout Grea Britain, so far as general cargo workers are concerned, as to the basis upon which loca agreements shall be negotiated in order to give a 44-hour working week, and compensatini increases in wages.  A partial agreement has been effected so far as the coal trimmers ani tippers are concerned, and  a further conference will be held on the 31st March.  Negotia tions between the Irish employers  and  the Federation are to  begin on Friday, the 28$ March.    Tramway Men. An agreement has been arrived at, as a result of which the 48-hom working week is to be introduced throughout Great Britain  on Monday, the 31st Marcl The reduction  of hours is  conditional upon the  companies and municipalities obtainingby June next, sanction  for an  increase in fares to 100 per cent,  over pre-war fares.    * Late on. Thursday. 27th March, it was announced that the delegate meeting of the National Unioi of Railwaymen had ratified  the  Agreement, subject to satisfaction on  the points  outstanding. It was af ratified by the Locomotive Engineers and Firemen&apos;s Society the same day.t0e:oiitlfiRai
    Motor Omnibus Workers. Representatives of the London Omnibus Companies agreed to meet the Transport Workers&apos; Federation on the 27th March to discuss the concession of a shorter working week, without reduction in wages. Other  Workers&apos; Demands.    Police. A  conference of  delegates from various parts of the country called by the National Union of Police and Prison  Officers,  met in London on the 24th March.   The chief subject for discussion was a scheme for the reconstruction of the Union drawn up by Mr., James Marston, Chairman of the  Executive  Committee, together with  a  series  of amendments relating to  it.    Cotton Operatives. At a joint meeting on the  20th March the employers in the cotton trade offered a 491-hour week instead of the 44-hour week  demanded by the operatives.  The employers refuse tchagree to  the maintenance of the present scale  of wages, urg ng that as their trade is mainly export, they cannot afford to ignore the in- creased competition of America and Japan.  The meeting was adjourned for three weeks to allow the operatives&apos; representatives to lay the proposal before their members.    London-Poor Law Employees. At a conference of employees in the Metropolitan Poor Law Institutions held on the 22nd March demands  were put forward  which included a 48-hour week, a 50 per cent, increase on pre-war rates of wages, plus existing war bonus. and 15 days&apos; annual leave with pay.    Asylum Workers. The Asylum Workers are demanding a 48-hour week, and a general levelling up of wages. Joint  Industrial Councils.    Buildtng. At a meeting of the Administrative Committee on  the 13th March dis- satisfaction was expressed  at the delay in starting the Government Housing  schemes, and still more at the serious  stoppage in private building, which was partly attributed to the fact that a large number of brickyards were derelict and require some form  of subsidy to  be re-started.    Road Transport. At the first  meeting of  this  Council  on the 11th March, among other  matters,  a  resolution was passed suggesting  &quot; That  any new  departmental re- sponsibility for  roads or road traffic should be vested in a Board or Boards, instead  of in an  individual  Minister, and that  this Joint Industrial Council should  have equal representation with the State  on such a Board.&quot;                                    &apos;    Women Workers. On Wednesday, the 26th March, Sir R.  Home received a deputa- tion at the  Ministry of Labour, representing the  National Federation of General Workers and the National Federation of Women Workers, for the purpose of hearing and discussing suggestions regarding the question of unemployment among women.                       *         (2) District Reports. London and. South-Eastern.    Unemployment. Unemployment is still increasing in London;  for the week ending the 14th March an increase of  13,000 men and 1,700  women unemployed  is reported. There is little immediate possibility of finding employment for large numbers  of semi- skilled and  unskilled workers until trade in general, and building in particular, revives.    Diluted Labour.-Dismissals and the employment of dilutee substitutes has been causing trouble, especially at the  works of Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., Crayford, where a meeting was held on the 17th March to protest  against the dismissal of six members of the A.S.E. and the employment of six  women in their place.  On the same day the whole of the factory hands of the Goswell  Clothing  Company,  High Street, Stratford, came out to demand the re- instatement of a dismissed employee.   On the 19th March, 150 woodworkers came out at the Fairey Aviation Works. Harlington, claiming that diluted labour should be discharged first.    Woolwich.-Woolwich Arsenal is completely closing down for the first week in April for stocktaking.  The men are demanding pay for that week at the minimum rate.    Resolutions have been passed at one or two meetings at Woolwich demanding the removal of income  tax on wages under  5 a week as &quot; barely a living wage.&quot; Yorkshire and East Midland Division.    Unemployment. Unemployment is serious in Bradford, Derby, Hull, Halifax, LeedsRotherham, Sheffield (where approximately 20,000 workpeople are unemployed), Wakefieldand Todmorden.  At Todmorden no provision of temporary relief measures to cope with
 unemployment is being made, since the Local Advisory Committee is of opinion that the- whole of the unemployed will be absorbed as soon as trade begins to right itself.  It is reported from Shipley that the situation would-be eased, if pre-armistice contracts were retained, and the situation caused by the French restrictions on import of textiles cleared up.  Unemployment and distress will naturally be caused in the Mansfield and Nottingham areas as industries become affected by the shortage of coal caused by. the strike of Notts miners.      Unrest.-Unrest in Sheffield is fairly pronounced.  There are already large numbers out  of work,  and employers, under the  fear   of a  coal  strike,  warned their workers that they m:ght have to leave on the 22nd.  The members of the Electrical Trades Union have a special source of irritation in the alleged delay in putting into force the agreement for  an  advance  in wages which the  Union  arrived at  with the engineering trades employers&apos; association^     Branch meetings of the Garment Workers&apos;  Union are being held in the Leeds area to demand a complete revision of pay and conditions.  A general delegate meeting is to decide standard rates, and a ballot will be taken to test the feeling of the workers as to a strike.     AVorkmen at ITolbrook Colliery Chemical Works gave in notices to take effect on the 22nd instant, unless a 6-hour day and a 30 percent, increase of wages were granted.  The men belong  to the  National  Amalgamated Union of Labour and are affiliated to the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Union.                                                         jSouth Midlands and Eastern.     Unemployment. An increase of unemployment at Norwich is reported among dock and general labourers, and at Cambridge in the building trades;  at Ipswich  both these classes are affected.                                                                south-Western.

They demand!particularly that all overtime and week-end Avork should be stopped.                 j     Profit-sharing.

Wales.                                 PART  V. DISPUTES.                           (a)  Involving a Stoppage of Work.Reported from  Various Sources.           Several thousand miners employed at the collieries in the Rhondda Valley struck work        on the 24th March as a protest against the  non-acceptance by the Government of the whole        of the miners&apos; demands.           A lock-out has taken place at the South Staffordshire Iron Works owing to the nego-        tiations for an 8-hour day having broken down.           The strike of  the Barrow joiners, which began on the 30th January, ended on the 24th        March.  The men  protested against the premium bonus system, which was introduced during        the war; the question is to be discussed at  a conference.           The Bristol Channel ship repairers, who have been on strike since the 23rd January,        resumed work on  the 25th March.  The  men had refused the piecework rates proposed by        the employers, and declared that they would only work on a day wage. This the employers        declined to agree to, and offered improved piecework rates, which the men now accept, subject        to further negotiation.           There appear  to be prospects of  a settlement of the strike in the Nottinghamshire coal-        fields.   The owners have offered to pay the increased price of 8s. 3d. per shift demanded by        the men for work in difficult places ;  arbitration  was suggested on other points.  A further        meeting of the Nottinghamshire Miners&apos; Association will be held on the  27th March to receive        the decision of the men on the subject of the owners&apos; offer.           Certain other local  disputes are  referred to in Part IV.                           (6) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.Reported from  Various Sources.           The Labour Exchange clerks in the South-Eastern Division threatened to  strike on the        26th March in support of their demands for increased pay and improved conditions.  It has,        however, been agreed that the Treasury shall receive a deputation, and if no decision results        the differences will be referred to the Board of Arbitration and Conciliation for Government        Employees.           The West Lancashire farm labourers have resolved to hand in notices on the 29th  March        to expire on the 5th April to those farmers who have not conceded the 5s. weekly increase        and 50 hour week demanded by the men.     UnemploymenL-CaxdiE,  Carnarvon,  and  Swansea areas are  those most seriously affected  by unemployment.   General labourers, platers,  and  riveters, are  the classesmost numerously represented among the men  who have recently received the donationfor the first time.     The Railwaymerfs Programme.-k mass meeting of the Cardiff branches of the N.U.R.has passed a resolution approving the  action of the special general meeting  of delegatesin refusing to  accept the &quot; meagre  offer of the Railway Executive,&apos;&apos; and pledging their full support to any action decided on to enforce the full national programme.Scotland.     Unrest. The miners are reported  to be  satisfied in general with the recommenda-tions of the Sankey Report, though in Lanarkshire some efforts have been made to organisean opposition to its acceptance.  The extremists demand, in particular, that there shouldbe no compromise on the demand for a 30 per cent, increase of wages.  Little, if any,agitation is reported among railway and transport workers, who  are leaving negotiationsentirely  in the hands of their official  leaders.  The  trial of  the twelve Glasgow strikeleaders at the High Court in Edinburgh has been fixed for the 7tli April, and their sym-pathisers are appealing for funds to defend them and to support their families.     Wages. The refusal of the Court of Arbitration to consider the claim of the engineer-ing and  shipbuilding trades  for a wage advance has been followed by  a movement, seton  foot  by the local trade  union officials,  to  incorporate war advances into permanentwages.     Housing. Satisfactory progress in the  housing schemes approved by  the  LocalGovernment Board for Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Wishaw,  Renfrew, and Hamiltonis reported, but in Coatbridge the absence of pivotal men is said  to have created a dead-lock.
