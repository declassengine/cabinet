ACTION  TAKEN.          Food Council. Mr. A. E. Towle, Assistant Secretary in charge of the Fish, Fruit      and Vegetables Division, has been appointed a member of the Council.          The Council met on March 27th and April 1st. &apos;.,          Memoranda on the arrangements already made  and proposed  for relinquishing      control of  all commodities dealt with by the Ministry of Food were considered.  It      was agreed that  a  statement on the  subject  should  be  sent to the Cabinet;  which      should be based  upon these memoranda, and should set out the proposals of the Food      Controller for bringing the Ministry of Food  to an end, and for transferring to other      Departments such of its functions as it is considered should still be exercised.          A memoraudum submitted by the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies on the      decontrol of cereals, which  is given in  another  part of this Report,  was  formally      approved.          As regards  butter, it was decided that in view both of the  very large expense      which would  be involved and  of the fact that ample  supplies  of margarine were      available,  the&quot; Council could  not accept  the  recommendation  of  the  Consumers&apos;      Council that the registration of customers should continue for an indefinite period.      It was accordingly agreed that the use of coupons should cease at the  beginning of      May  with  the currency of the  Ration  Book, the system  of registration  with  free      exchange of retailers being retained till J une 30th.        .  It was  reported that  the supply and  distribution of-  imported meat would be      freed  from control on June 30th,  but  maximum prices  would be retained until      September 30th; and that control of  home-produced  meat would  cease on  the latter      date.          The Council were  informed that the  only foodstuffs which could be affected by the      decontrol of the American exchange were bacon, lard and condensed milk ; but that      there  was  at present no prospect that the necessary supplies could not be  imported.      The Ministry has  arranged, with the assistance  of  Sir Hardman Lever, to keep in      close touch with the situation.          Imports Board. The following- statement shows the position of purchases, ship-      ments and arrivals for  the week ended March 22nd :                 Feeding Stuffs.-Shipments have been satisfactory except from India and            Burmah.   The actual quantities loaded during the week were as follows  :-                              .       ...  ,. . ..   ;  r.,  . . .      ;,         , Tons.

The purchase of Argentine  butter for the months September            1918 to March. 1919 will show a small excess over the estimated yield of 11,000            tons.                 There  will   be a substantial  exportable surplus  available this year from            Denmark, part  of which the  Danish Government are anxious to  send to the            United Kingdom.  Inquiries as  to price  and conditions  of delivery are now            being made.  Similar inquiries are being undertaken in  Holland where it is            understood that the Government hold a reserve of some 3,000 tons which  they            may be prepared to sell.                 There is further  a balance of  1,200 tons of the butter allotted to the United            Kingdom by the United States Food Administration for which contracts have            not yet been made/  The authority of H.M. Treasury for  sanction to purchase            this quantity is  being requested.                 Recent shipments of butter have been good.                 Condensed  Milk. The balance  to be  shipped  from the United States on            March 22nd was 2,000 to 3,000 tons.  The  last general distribution to the            trade tpok place on April 1st.

There have been no shipments  for several  weeks from, the Argentine, where       the balance is over 34,000 tons.  It may be necessary  to arrange for the  sale       of this balance either to Germany&apos;or in the Argentine.     Labour Conference. The Tenth Labour Conference was held  at  the New County Hall on March 29th, Sir William Beveridge being in the chair.     The following were the principal resolutions passed :        (a) With a view to increasing the home supply of foodstuffs and the consequent             lowering of prices, the meeting urges the Board of Agriculture and the             Ministries of Food and National Service, at once to take co-ordinating             steps to acquire large areas of land  for the purpose  of  cultivation by             discharged soldiers  and sailors who may  desire to be  so occupied, any             such scheme to be provided for  by assistance from the  State;  and             further,  this meeting is  of the opinion  that  the steps  taken in  this      &apos;   -    direction by the Government are insufficient to meet  the requirements             of the position.      &apos; (b) The  meeting  demands  that the  Government  publish  immediately  the             information  recently obtained regarding  the starving condition of the             people of Eastern and Central Europe, and urges that the dictates of             humanity and common sense demand that  immediate steps be  taken to             relieve the needs of these peoples.                    ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE  SUGAR  SUPPLY.    Lord Bledisloe has resigned his positions as Chairman of the Royal Commissionon the Sugar Supply  and Director of Sugar Distribution at the Ministry of Food.Lord Bledisloe was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food until ill-healthcaused his retirement.  He succeeded Lord  Devonport as   Chairman of the RoyalCommission and his work has proved a conspicuous success.  - Speaking at  a  dinner  of the  National  Sugar ,Confectionery and  ChocolateConvention on April  2nd, Lord Bledisloe said that the control of sugar had becomeeasier every day, and  so far as the ordinary  domestic  consumer  was concerned  wasabout to  be relaxed to such an extent that he hoped  it would hardly be felt at all.But  it would not be in the interests of that industry or of  the general  public  thatsugar control should be relaxed altogether at the present time.   There was a&apos;world- shortage of  sugar, and there was no present  prospect of a fall in the world price or indeed of an increased supply for some time to come.     The temporary shortage of white sugar was  likely to  continue  for some time.He would not be so  rash  as  to say that  there would be even sufficient white sugarfor the requirements of jam  making, but he  did not think that private fruit growersneed feel doleful.  Without the intricate machinery set up  last year they  should be able to obtain as large supplies as  they had last year,  and there might be somethingavailable for those who  did  not  grow fruit  themselves but  were  in the  habit of preserving fruit purchased from others.   In those countries where  sugar was normallylargely produced,  especially Germany, there was no  doubt  that a considerable area. which would normally be  occupied with  the  beet  sugar crop, would during the nextfew years be occupied with the production of breadstuffs.   The  f.o.b, price of Java sugar had more  than  trebled  during the  last eight  or nine months,  and  unless wewere careful in years to come, so great was the increased production of cane sugar in neutral countries that  there would be a great temptation for countries like  Cuba  and Java to create something  like a corner.   When Germany could export sugar it would undoubtedly be absorbed into the general consumption throughout the world,  andwould to that extent  ease  the sugar position:   He  could not say how long  the SugarControl was likely to  last.  It was certain to  last until the  late autumn, probably tothe end of the year, or even longer.                  ; :                      &apos;      DECONTROL OF  CEREALS......?   -     The Royal Commission on. Wheat  Supplies  is anxious  to&apos; bring about decontrolas soon as possible, but it is  hampered in its  efforts,&quot;probSblyJto  a/greater  degree
than any other  supply division, by Tuter-Ailied obligations.   Some progress  lias,however, already been made, and it is expected that it will be possible to  extend  and.accelerate decontrol in the near future.                              .             ,.    On December 4th, 1918, all restrictions on importation and trading in the UnitedKingdom were removed in respect of a large number of articles, viz., starches, glucose,dextrines, farina,  tapioca, sago, manioc, cassava., mandioca, arrowroot,  potato flour,macaroni and all  such like products.   All restrictions on  the use of barby, dredgecorn, maize, rye, oats and their products have been removed, and  the only restrictionsnow in force on  the use of cereals are those.confining the use of wheat, rice and their products to human food.    Restrictions on  importation are still in force in varying degrees in  the  case ofwheat, barley, oats, maize, rice, beans,&apos; peas, other forms of pulse and their  products.All restrictions on  the importation of rye have been removed.    Wheat and,Wheaten Flour. It will be necessary to retain control of  the irnporta-tion of wheat and wheaten flour until world prices, tonnage and finance enable privateenterprise to maintain adequate supplies at  a  price sufficiently low to produce thequartern loaf at  9d. or less.  This  price is approximately 60s. per 480 lbs. for No. 1Manitoba wheat  with other  varieties  at their commercial parity, and it is not antici-pated   that the world&apos;s markets will reach the point at which general decontrol  willbecome possible until  the late autumn.  With  the  freeing of wheat from  control, acourse for which  the  assent of the Allies represented on the  Inter-Allied WheatExecutive is required, the Royal Commission will no longer trade in bread-stuffs.  Itwill be necessary, however, to  maintain the Accounts Branch of  the Commission forsome time after the introduction of decontrol, in  order that the Inter-Allied accountsmay be adjusted and the British accounts closed.    Barley. Restrictions on the importation of Californian, Oregon, Washington andChilian barleys  have been removed, and it has  been  decided that restrictions may now be removed in respect of other types of barley, whether for feeding or industrialuse.  The Royal Commission now imports only a limited quantity of barley for themanufacture  of  yeast,  and there is no reason to anticipate that private firms  willexperience any serious difficulty in  obtaining  supplies. The  Commission, is  also ofopinion that complete decontrol of  barley will result in a certain  quantity  of barleyreaching this country from  the United States  and Canada, and this will  be availablefor feeding ^purposes.  Barley  is not scheduled under the Wheat Executive agreement and decontrol is  not complicated by Inter-Allied obligations.    . 1 .           &apos;  .       :    Oats. Owing to commitments  to  the Allies  and to the War Office the  decontrolof oats cannot be carried out until alternative arrangements, calculated to ensure thenecessary supplies, have been  agreed upon.  The Italian Government will probablyfeel some apprehension on the proposal to de-schedule oats, but it is anticipated  thata guarantee covering the Italian  indent for oats in the programme  for  the  currentcereal  year  will be accepted  as  satisfactory.   The  War  Office  requirements aredecreasing, and  there should  be  no difficulty in meeting the demand either throughthe ordinary trade  channels or by way of purchase and shipment on  the  part of theWheat Commission.    Maize. It  will be  necessary  to  de-schedule  maize  before decontrol  can beintroduced, and  the Allies may take objection to this course.  It is doubtful, however,whether decontrol is at present opportune, for not  only do shipping difficulties makeit  impossible to take full advantage of the supplies of maize in  the Argentine, but-the labour position there also tends to  reduce the capacity of the  ports.   Further, theBritish Government has no credit  in  the Argentine  for the purchase of maize whilethe Loan Convention remains unsigned.    If imports are decontrolled, it is  anticipated that a limited amount  of business.will be done and  that the  margin between the prices in the Argentine and in theUnited Kingdom will enable importers to  pay a rate  of freight  sufficient  to attractultimately a considerable volume of tonnage provided that improved labour conditionsmake  it possible to load cargoes without excessive delay.  The Royal Commission  is accordingly  approaching ELM. Treasury with a  view to  ascertaining whether thereis any objection to  the&apos; Argentine exchange being thrown on  the market.  It  isdifficult  to estimate the effect of decontrol on  prices, but there is  every  reason  to anticipate that although prices might  advance at first they  would fall again to thepresent level, or  even lower, in the course of a few months.
    Rice. The Royal Commission is of opinion that all restrictions on the importa-tion of rice should be removed forthwith.  This course would not enable importers to resume normal business  immediately as the export of rice from Burma is prohibitedana prices in Saigon and Siam are too high  to permit of importation  in competition with the present selling prices of the Royal Commission.  Importers  might be able,however, to import  rice from  Saigon .and  Siam for re-export to  France where all restrictions on the importation of rice  have been  removed  or to other  european countries which do not hold large stocks of.  cheap rice.   The Royal Commission holdconsiderable supplies and it will  be possible until the end&apos; of the year or longer tomaintain supplies in this  country at a  price not exceeding  the present  maximum of id. per pound.    Beans, Peas and Pulse. Restrictions on the importation  of all kinds of feedingbeans and haricot beans have been removed and the Royal Commission  is of opinionthat free importation should also be allowed in respect of all other kinds of beans, peasand pulse.  The Maximum (Retail Prices) Order has been suspended,  but stocks heldby the Commission are sufficient to- ensure  that&apos; prices will not rise above the ratesscheduled in the Order.              .   .          SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION.    Bacon.--hi view of the decontrol of bacon  and the free licensing of bacon imports,the Bacon Board will cease as from April 2nd to act in an executive  capacity.  Mr. A.Morrell will also cease to act a3 Director of Bacon Imports.  Mr, Morrell and the other imembers of the Bacon Board, however, have consented to assist the  Ministry of Food,so far as required, in an advisory capacity, and will be available for  consultation fromtime to  time.                                    v-               : :    Major-General   Hobbs, as  General Director  of  Bacon Supplies, will  take direct responsibility for the allotment  of  the Ministry&apos;s stock.   Meetings of  the Joint Com-mittee of Importers, Wholesalers aDd. Retailers, will be  held  as  required  (as a  ruleevery fortnight) to  advise  the Ministry  on questions relating to the  disposal of the stocks and the fixing of prices therefor.    Meat. The supplies of live stock for last week were short in  all.markets, stockbeing held back with a view to the increase in wholesale prices on April 1st.  As a consequence the output of frozen meat rose to  11,589 tons.    Tea.--It has been decided to allow free importation of tea from all countries afterMarch 31st, to withdraw as from the  same date all restrictions on market transactions,and  to allow tea to be sold by  private sale, for home consumption.  The  various interests concerned are being consulted  on the methods  to be adopted for the disposalof tea at public sales.    Dried Fruits. Over 30,000 tons of dried fruits have been distributed during thelast six. weeks.               ORDKKS UNDER  DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.    A  general licence dated March 27th,  .19J 9, under  the  Beans Peas  and Pulse(Retail  Prices) Order,  1917, releases these commodities from  restrictions as to retail prices and sales under the Order.     The Bacon and Ham  (Prices)  Order, 1919,  dated  March 28th, 1919, revokes the bacon Ham and Lard (Prices) Order, 1918, and the licences thereunder, and providesmaximum wholesale prices for home-produced bacon and hams, and  maximum retail prices for all bacon and hams.   A general licence under the Rationing Order, 1918,releases bacon, ham and lard from restrictions under the Order.   -  A  notice dated 1st April revokes the Milk Products (Import  Restriction) Order,1918,  and the Milk (Products) Returns Order, 1918.  Restrictions on  the imports  ofcondensed milk (other than canned condensed milk), dried milk and sugar of milk aremow removed and returns are no longer required.                              ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.     The total number of prosecutions during  the week ended  March 22nd was 632, of which 604 were successful.                                                 ,fn  .&apos;,\
PART II.-SUMMARY  GF THE FOOD  POSITION.                                     STOCKS.    Stocks of  meat and  provisions in cold stores  and  warehouses in the United;Kingdom on March 22nd showed a general decrease as compared with a week before;The fall was most marked in the case of refrigerated meat (6,700 tons), bacon (2,600tons)j canned meat (1,200 tons), cheese  (1,800 tons), butter (800 tons), and condensed milk  (1,10.0 tons).   As to stocks  held by the Ministry  on the same dates, cerealsshowed a fall of .77,000 tons-, and the  approaching measures of decontrol accountedfor the larger depletion of bacon (3,500 tons) and lard (1,100 tons), as compared; withtotal stocks in the United Kingdom.  On the other hand there  were marked increases.of butter (3,200 tons), cheese (800 tons), and dried  fruits  (5,500 tons).  The oppositemovements of the butter and cheese stocks in the  two returns  are  explained by thefact that  large quantities were written off Ministry stocks for distribution early  in themonth, and were only gradually removed from the stores  and  warehouses.  Againstthe decreases of stocks in the United Kingdom must be set increases in the quantitiesin transit to the United Kingdom, e.g.,  in the case of cereals (36,000 tons), refrigeratedmeat  (1,300 tons),  and butter (2,000 tons), so that the fall  of stocks is  largely of atemporary character. ,    The position as regards Ministry stocks and  purchases on March 22nd is  shownin the following table :                                                         ,Stocks held by the Ministry of Food on 22nd March 1919.Commodity.

The total imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in  the  week endedMarch 22nd (116,900 tons) remained at the level of  the  preceding  month, and were still  below the average of the first  13 weeks of the calendar year (147,500 tons) or ofthe first 30 weeks of the cereal year (166,400 tons).   The outstanding features werethe very large quantities  of  sugar  (46,100 tons) and  of meat (16,000 tons) and thefurther drop of cereals to 33,300 tons, which is by far the lowest quantity for any weekiii the current cereal year, and compares with  the weekly average  of  71,900  tons.Bacon also showed a further slight decrease, the arrivals for the last three weeks being at less than half  the rate of preceding months.   Of the less bulky commodities, therewere  substantial arrivals of  tea (7,100 tons), coffee (2,800 tons), cocoa (3,700 tons),and  condensed milk (2,000 tons)rbut-.the  quantity of cheese fell sharply to 410  tons,while that of butter (120 tons) was negligible.a 7792-113

Butchers Meat. There was a further falling off in  the  supplies of liye stock atmarkets in Great Britain in the week ended March  22nd and estimated total suppliesof home-grown  meat fell by 3,500 tons to 13,600 tons.  Issues of refrigerated meatrose by 1,800 tons to 9,400 tons, making a total supply of  23,000 tons.   The estimatedconsumption of  rationed meats in  the four weeks ended March 22nd was 24 per cent.below  the quantity the Ministry  was prepared to issue as rations, and additional supplies to butchers and caterers.    It would appear  that  a certain proportion of  consumers or  butchers  prefer toaccept smaller supplies rather than take a larger proportion of frozen meat.  this may disappear Avith the &quot;differentiation of price for.  home and imported meat.  Theexperience of recent months, with  the regular fluctuation in home supplies arisingfrom the advancing scale of prices  to farmers on the first of  each month, is given inthe following table, which  shows that the variations in  total consumption have beengoverned  by the movements in home supplies, increasing with an increase in home-fed meat and decreasing as that falls off.Week ending.

In the light of this, thequantity of  flour delivered from mills or released from imported supplies now shows a return to the normal rate after the exceptional  quantities distributed in.the first twomonths to build up local stocks.   The fall in  the  quantity of  bacon allocated for civilian consumption  in the  four  weeks ended  March  22nd was due to  the check todistribution arising from uncertainty in the trade as to the  effects of the removal ofcontrol at the end of the month.    The figures for the first 30 weeks of  the cereal years 1917-18  and 1918-19 arecompared  in the following table :    .
    Milk,-The index showing variations in the quantity o  milk carried on  theprincipal railways is continued, in Table  C (4);: it shows a normal  movement  ofsupplies, except that the seasonal increase occurred somewhat earlier this year.   this applies also to the decrease shown for the week ended March 22nd, which is due to afalling off in the milk forwarded from  the principal dairying districts, and; wouldappear to be associated with the opening of the season for  the local  manufacture  of milk products.
