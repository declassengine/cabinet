J This Document fs t??,o  Property of          00His Britanrs-:        ,  GovernmentMWORAlfDUM BY THh BOARD 0? TROT.Proposed extension of Courts (1&apos;menrenoy          lowers)  Act, 1917.      A number of contracts that  were  entered into before  the 7ar or in the early days of the  &apos;;ar (when people were en- , couraged to take orders to prevent &quot;-unemployment) have now to  be fulfilled.   Their fulfilment hitherto has been pre- vented either (a)  through direct Government  action or (b) through exigencies arising out of the  &apos;,/ar such  as shortage of  labour or materials.    There  is a  serious difficulty In the way of the  completion of these orders namely,  that the prices at the present  time  are far in  excess of the  prices at  the time  when the orders were taken,  so that the  execu- tion of the  work at the  agreed prices  would  prenerally he  ruin- ous to the producer.      A number of these  contracts have  already been settled by mutual arrangement between buyer and seller/but a number are still outstanding  owing to  the fact  that  one of the  parties is  unwilling to  agree  to reasonable terms and insists  on  the strict observance  of the  letter  of the contract.      In order to strengthen the  hands, of  those  who are ready to  fall in with  reasonable  proposals for  the  adjustment of prices,  it arrears to  the  Board  of Trade  that existing legis- lation should be extended;   and  in this view the  Board have the  support  of  their Advisory Council.      The  legal position  at  the present time  under  the Courts (Emergency Powers)  Act 1917 is as  follows:- (a)   If the  performance  of  a contract has been  prevented by      direct. Government action, the Courts may,  after con-      siderinp, the  circumstances  of the case/and  the posi-      tion.of: the oarties  to  the  contract  and  any offer      which nay have been made bv any party for  the varia-      tion of  the contract,  suspend  or&apos;annul  the contract    \  or stay  any proceedings for  the enforcement  of  the    I  contract or any term  (hereof.      This  provision is not  sufficient  to  protect  the pro-producer  in  all  cases, as  in many instances  the  trouble nasbeen  not  direct  Government  action  but circumstances arising out  of the War.- (b)   However, in the case of building contracts entered      into  before &quot;the war  it  is provided in the  same Act       that where  the Court  is satisfied that, owing  to      the  prevention or restriction of, or the delay m .    .  the  suooly  or  delivery  of materials,  or the  diversion      or  insufficiency of labour  occasioned by the war,   &quot; I  the  contract  cannot be  enforced, according  to  its      terms without  serious  hardship, the  Court  may similar-    1  ly suspend  or annul  the contract  or  stay proceedings   , s  for  its&apos;enforcement.    That  is to say the  Courts are   I   given full  discretion  with  regard to pre-war  building      aontracts,  whether  the cause  preventing the perform^-;      ance  of tiie contract is direct Government  action or      not.
       (c)       (d)^   (a)       (f)     ifyrther, as regards existing legislation, it-should be observed that this only remains applicableuntil six months after the end or the War,     The proposals of the Board of Trade are;-That the Act should be extended for 3 years.That the .uct should apply to all contracts made beforethe 1st January 1916,&quot;or even a later date.That the power riven to the Court over building con-tracts made before 4th August 1914 should be extendedto all contracts so that relief could be obtainedwhere performance was impeded on account of shortageof material or labour as&quot;well as by direct Governmentinterference,That the 1917 Act should be amended so as to take intoaccount the general shortage of shipping, and notmerely the requisition of a particular snip.That where action was brought upon any contract made &apos;before the war, or before such extended date as is re-ferred to in (b), the Court should have power, whenassessing damages, to have regard to the position ofthe oarties caused by &apos;the war and to any settlementthat&quot;may have been made.   If either party had actedunreasonably in refusing to come to terms., this wouldenable nominal damages to be given.That the Act of 1917 be amended so as to. enable theCourts to suspend or annul a term of a contract while leaving the rest of the contract in force;  and alsoto enable proceedings to be permanently and not merelytemporarily, stayed.&apos;   /This proposal is made in viewof  the decision&apos; in a recent case. (Metropolitan ElectricSupply Co., v London County Council!/.     If  this is done  there are  strong reasons  to suppose that very few cases will come into Court,  as  it willbe  in  the interest of those who are now  taking an un-reasonable  view to come  to terms rather  than risklitigation.Board of Trade,31st March, 1919.
