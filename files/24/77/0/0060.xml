I circulate for  the in formation of aycolleagues a memorandum  on the&quot; Subject of Fisherieswhich has been sent to me by Lord Dunraven,(signed)   W,H* Long,               89:3:19,
                   The question of  fisheries  must be considered in          its  relation to  four fairly  distinct  subjects.  (1) Food          supply,  (2)  Development and  protection of the industry.          (3)  Propagation  of  fish.   (4)  An adequate Naval Auxiliary          Reserve.i          (1)       We  are  suffering, and the  world is suffering fromily.        a  shortage of  food.   In normal times  our consumption of meat          was  about 7  ozs  per head  per day, and of fish about 1*7          oas .per head per day.  Under the rationing system meat fell          to approximately 2  ozs per day.   I  have no statistics at my          disposal  but I calculate  the present  consumption at 3 ozs          per  day,  and in  view of the  fact that the world1s supply          of flocks and  herads  has fallen below  the world1 s demand it is          not  likely to  be increased beyond that for man;/ years to          come. *    The deficiency in meat must be made good in some          other flesh  food product  if  the  people are to be          sufficiently supplied with cheap food in the future.          The  ocean is the obvious  source  of  additional supply.                   &quot;fish is in quality  wholesome and in quantity          inexhaustible.  In  food values an acre of suitable water          is more  prolific, than any acre of land.  The produce of the          sea  can  be harvested far  more  rapidly and cheaply than          the__prodii7.ee  of the  land.   The  food  is there to  our hands          and  tho  only problem is,  how to  transfer it to  our mouths.          .(2)       To  meet the deficiency  of  meat the supply of fish          must be  very largely increased.   During the War the          consumption  of meat fell  from  7  ozs to&apos;2 oss per head - a          shortage of  5  ozs.   Assuming the consumption is now 3 ozs          the  shortage is  4 ozs andJLikely to remain at about that          figure for a long time,   Assuming -( a very unwarrantable          assumption)  that our catch of  fish  speedily reaches the          catch of  1013, namely 1,230,000  tons, and assuming          (another improbability) that the whole of it is consumed          at home.,  a serious  deficiency  will  still exist.  It is          well within  the  mark to say  that 1,500,000 tons must be          provided from some  other  source  to  bring up flesh food          consumption  to pre-war levels.  The requisite quantity          of fish  cannot possible be found by any  immediate          development  of the  home industry.  Wc must draw upon the          vast supply  waiting to be tapped in Newfoundland and          Canadian Waters, Pacific Coast  fish, notably salmon, can          be landed at Liverpool at an inclusive cost of  about 9d,          per  lb;  but  the  prolific  catches of cod and other fish foom          Newfoundland at  a, much cheaper price. It is to Newfoundland          and  Labrador waters that  we  must look.  The supply is          inexhaustible.  To  avail  ourselves  of it the primes  In this, as in ail other calculations re shipping,etc., I am necessarily relying on information accessible to the public.  My figures probably require checking bythe Government Departments concerned but are. I believe,s,..betantial ly correct,
3c  At present the fisherman not only catches the codbut cures thorn and the curing process takes up muchof his time.  If the fish were sent straight to cold storage the time spent in drying 4he fish &quot;would be saved and the catch Largely increased.necessaries are transport, cold storage at certainports of exportation, and cold storage in certain ports of importation and in all our large towns and distributing centres.  The industry in Newfoundlandwould of course develop under the stimulus of assureddemand,  but it would require assistance in acquiringup to date methods of capture and providing localtransport to St,Johns the exporting centre.  In fact theindustry requires reorganisation on&apos; sound business lines,the conversion of a salt fish into a chilled fish trade,35financial assistance to procure nets, fishing vessels andcarriers.  Our trawlers can of course fish Newfoundlandwaters from homo, but such a method would be verywasteful.  The industry should developJLocally.   Theresources of the Dominions can be made available for ouruses only by arrangements between our Government  and theGovernments of the &quot;&quot;Dominions.  It is a matter for a department of the State. (3)       The  industry has always been  too  much in the hands  of  the  trade,  of  buyers and salesmen,  combines and rings,  store  owners,  agents  and markets.   This is natural and  indeed  inevitable in  a trade dealing with a  very perishable  article.   From the point  of view  of the trade, as distinct from the industry, fish  scarce and dear is easier to handle, and is  at  least as profitable, as fish plentiful a,nd cheap.  The trade must be  reorganised and placod on a sounder  basis if the main  object - cheap food for  the people - is  to  be attained. Hew  is this to be done?          Means of preservation, that is  refrigerating plant,  curing and pickling,  the manufacture  of by-products* should be established in  the principal fishing ports according to  the general  nature  of fish  landed,.  It is outrageous  in these  days  that for instance large mackerel should be seMing at a  penny a dozen or  should be  thrown away in one part &quot;of  the United Kingdom,  and  should fefcch shillings a piece in another.  Thousands and thousands  of tons of&quot;fish  are wasted through the  operations,  or rather want of operation, of fish rings who refuse  to bul?,  or if they buy  at all pay  at  an unremunerative price to  the producer  and  soli again at enormous  profit.  If  large catches are made the fishermen should  have an opportunity of selling  at a reasonable price,  The occurrence  of large catches cannot be predicted.   Curing or refrigerating plant may make a loss in one place,  a  large  profit in another,  and  a good           . profit all round;  but private  enterprise  will  not put up  plant on a gamble. The  State must do it.  In short  the  industry at&quot;home is a tied one, and must be untied by  the  State if the producer is to get a decent price  for his labour  and  the  consumer is to pay a decent price  for his food. (4)       At present  eleven Departments are concerned with fisheries without  counting  innumerable  County Committees  and:iothersk  Co-ordination is  necessary.   A.s a small example, I want&quot; an export  adviser  about
constructing a weir that will catch eels hut will notcatch smolts (salmon fry) I cannot get one because the experts are in England and the river is in Ireland. I do -not want to supersede the Scotch Board or the lihglish and irish sub-departments *  But all these authorities clashand over-lap.  The interests of the whole fishingpopulation of the United Kingdom must be considered.  TheDepartments in England, Scotland, and Ireland, must bebrought under one head. 5)      The question of territorial waters will&apos; be iscussed possibly by the Peace Conference.  It must besettled for at present no recognised principle isobserved.  The limits of territorial waters vary invarious countries, for instance in Italy, as our navyfound to its cost when it was hunting the Goeben and theBroslau, the limit is double that of&quot;our own coasts.  Itis impossible for fishermen to know whether they aretrespassing or not.  The matter should not be left for settlement&quot;to geographers and politicians.  The viewsof our own fishermen as to extension or contraction ofcur limits, and as to the mutual use &quot;of harbours for landing fish should be ascertained.(6)      Central control is also needed to determine localquestions such as areas in which trawling is prohibited.The English and Irish sub-departments and the ScotchBoard can act as they please, but it. must be rememberedthat English and Scotch boats use Scotch, English, -Irish waters and/ports.(7)      The herring industry (that is our main East Coastfleet)  opens in the Shet lands in May and closes aboutthe end of December at Lowestoft.  The splitters and curers(Scotch women)&apos; follow the fleet down the coast.  It isan export trade.  The great bulk of herrings were^boughtby German, buyers and went to Germany anal through Germanyto -Russia,  What is to be the future of the industry?Drifters have to be reconditioned and fitted out, netsbought and a train of nets now cost about  600 or  700,One of three things must happen,  Gorman buyers mustbe allowed to buy and export, or the State must buy,,  .-7otherwise the drifters will to a; large extent be laid -1cue&apos;-Many will be sold to Norwegians and Swedes - probably for germany. 8)      Markets must be provided in suitable places, illingsgate was well situated when the supply of fish wassea borne.  It is q: ite unsuitable now that&apos;the bulk of it comes by rail necessitating a long haulage to the market and usually arriving too late for&quot;that days sale.  Kuehperishable fish is thus spoiled.  State or municipal retailshops must be established.(9)      Railway rates must be controlled and reduced^As a small example,  I have for many years owned aLowestoft steam drifter and made experiments long-liningin.&apos;Kenma,re Bay (Ireland) I found large quantities of coarsefish and a ready market in Dublin,  Quite a little localindustry might have been crea,ted;  but the railway Dateswere prohibitive,(10)     It is quite impossible for individuals, orassociations of individuals, or the.multitude of
 sub-departments and Boards and Committees., to handle this business.  To secure supplies from the Dominions relations must be established&apos;with tho Dominion Governments,  To place -the industry at home on a sound basis and to ensure fair terms as between producer and consumer cold storage, cring stations and&apos;transport &apos;inust be  provided and railway rates controlled.  Retailers must be  provided with fish as fixed rates varying, of course, from time to time.  The industry must be handled as a whole and the various sub-departments in ,unglanfl, Scotland and Ireland must bo co-ordinated.  This can only be accomplished by the State (11)     We are not nainirally a fish eating people. The reason for the relatively small consumption &quot;of fish as compared with meat is not fa,r to seek.  A large proportion of  our home catch (mainly herrings) was exported, and fish has always been dear partly through scarcity but largely through waste, the absence of sufficient&apos;moans of preservation,  and the operations of trusts and rings. Cheap fish will create demand;  the fried fish shops vail do  a roaring trade but habit is hard to overcome and information should be given to the general public as to th the best ways of preparing various Kinds of  fish frosh or cured.   Soused mackerel for instance largely consumed in the United States is practically unknown to  our people. A fish propaganda is desirable, (12)     The Admiralty have, I believe, built a large number of sweepers,.   These vessels can be- adapted to trawling or used as  carriers, and they should&quot;be so adapted and used as fast as  they can be freed&apos; from sweeping- The Admiralty also possess a number of small craft,  and the engines of small craft, that might be utilised for inshore fishing.  These ships and boats&quot;and engines  should not bo sold to companies or syndicates or stores.  That would emphasise some of the evils under which the  industry suffers.  &quot;The men who have rendered such magnificent service during the war should be given a direct interest ji them.   The craft should be transferred to some co-operative association managed  by practical men subject to Admiralty control so long as is necessary,  The hands  should form a permanent reserve - an auxiliary force in civil employment; ships  and men liable to be called up in case of emergency -hands  to serve an annual months training.  So far as fishing is concerned they must be left to themselves. The insistry must be worked by the practical men who know how to work&quot;it;  but,  in return for service,  they shouldbe given certain advantages,  perhaps cheap insurance, financial assistance in creating co-operative stores wheis gear could be supplied at wholesale prices,   Owners (whetherindividuals  or companies) of drifters and trawlers that have been commandeered would come into  line and joinwhat might bo called the Auxiliary Fishing Fleet.
is regardsriltivation.independent of StateExpenditure.(13)Our fisheries have been neglected.Yearno re year  inplonents  of capture  have become noro  and efficient with the result that the waters of the Channels and North Sea have beoono depleted and our trawlers have been  driven to make long voyages to polar regions and as far  south  as  Morocco.  The waters of the  North Sea and Channel have had a rest during the war and fish will be plentiful  - floating runes fairly plentiful also till they  are swept and wrecks dangerous till they are charted. But supply will  be cone exhausted unless propagation is undertaken.   So far as the deep sea is concerned this can of  course only be done  under international agreement. But we  can act for ourselves in the case of  our territorial waters.,  estuaries and rivers.   That the supply  of what nay be termed inshore sea fish and crustaceans - lobsters and  crabs - salmon and other fishes  that ascend rivers to spawn can be enormously increased, is demonstrated by the experience  in the United States, Canada and Japan.         Ever since  1870 the United States has maintained a Federal Bureau of  Fisheries, its sole duty being, in the words of its founder Professor Spencer Baird, to provide &quot;cheap food  for the people at large&quot;.   The annual  expenditure is now about  210,000*&quot;  The &quot;firstvalue&quot;  - that is the money received by the fishermen - of the United States Fisheries is now well over  15,000,000 It is greater than that of any other country.   As aresult&quot;of intensive  cultivation the United Statesproduces more than onefro. i the beds, of asinglehalf the   stateworld1s yield of oysters- Virginia - the annual              Statesharvest is nine million bushels.   The UnitedBureau is charged with the development of the Philippine .and Panama Zone waters no less than with that of theNew England coast.  Its chief and his colleagues spendmuch tine on tour all ever the world acquiring first handinformation of all fishery problems and developments,not in one sea, but in all the Seven seas.         Japan invited the present United StatesCommissionerHugh Smith,to establish there an imperial Bureau of Fisheries on the Washington model.This he accomplished, and the Japanese fishery has ,already in these few years become the second in the world and sexUnite dvery^ood second indeed -* to its parent theIn JLOCnamelyaStates.  I will mention one or two instances of results- two species of fish unknown in the Pacific, the shad and the striped bass, were planted bythe Federal Government off San Francisco-, and in thereport for 1896, only ten year3 later, the commissioner of Fisheries states:-  &quot;The market value to the fishermenof the Pacific Coast of the shad and striped bass takenbetween 1888 and 1896 was about  192,000.   The aggregateexpense of introducing these fish to the Pacific Coastwas under ^5,000.11   And we are told in one of the reoentReports that the shad now ascend  these-Paoifio Coastrivers to spawn along a littoral of nearly 3,000 miles.         In Canada the 56 Government hatcheries releaseyearly 100000,000 salmon and trout, 493,000,000 whitefish and 900,000,000 lobsters.   To show how utterlynegligent we have been it issuffic:.ent to say that fcrevery pound we in this densely populated and sea-girtcountry spent on fisheries Canada has spent five pounds
 and the  United  States  have  spent  twenty^-six pounds, and it  has paid then well.    To put it  shortly so far as fish culture is &quot;concerned the experimental stage has long ago been passed and  that it  pays to  invest largo sums in  scientific propagation :1s proved. (14)    Thero  remains to consider  the effect of the importation of  largo quantities of  Doininion fish upon the hone market.   &quot; Will  it out pricos injuriously?    I do  not think so.   A small tax will he i-jposod upon the imported fish.   Pish would become  divided roughly into three categories.   Frozen or thoroughly  cured or tinned. in  a condition  to keep for months&apos;.  Chilled or partially cured fit to  keep for  a few weeks.  Fresh, that is alive on  landing,  requiring perhaps a little sprinkling of ice for  transportation.   The fresh  fish vail always command  its  price.   Cheap Newfoundland rind chilled or fro-zen cod will have little or no effect  upon fresh English  black soles or prime fish of any  kind.   But if the imported article does cut&apos;prices injuriously our fishermen must  be protected.   During the war the bulk of  our fishing  population were serving.    The cld; the young, and those otherwise unfit  for service carried on at  groat risk to life and property.    Many lives and many boats were  lost. &apos;   The profits were  enormous but well deserved.   The industry has no right to expect similar profits  in the future; but  it has a right to a fair profit.    If prices  are out by importation the .state must interfere by supplementing the customary profit sharing by a flat wage.   V/e cannot,have  it both ways.  - If  the industry and the trade is  left severely alone they will take  care of themselves; but there will be WMste and fish&quot;will be scarce and dear.    If we want a constant sunpix stable  supply of  fish food for the people,  cheap in itself and reacting upon other food prices and  so bringing down the  cost of  living, the fishing  industry and trade must be  controlled and if necessary assisted by the States (16)     Whether provision is  to be made for supplying the people, at large, and  steps aro to be taken for the intensive cultivation -of  our territorial waters, estuaries mid rivers or not the creation cf a Fisheries Department under a responsible minister is absolutely necessary. The personnel of the existing Boards, sub-departments and committees  could be to a large  extent utilised-   Butreconstruction and co-ordination under a minister responsible to Parliament is essential even if activities are confined tc reorganising our home industry disorganis- ed by the war,  and providing an Auxiliary Naval Reserve.But I,hope the  larger view will be taken. (16)     A considerable expenditure of capital is necessary, but  it would he a sound  investment - profitable expenditure on the part  of the State.  So far as  inshore fisheries and  rivers are concerned tho profit would be to  a large extent, indirect, consisting of more abundant and consequently cheaper salmon, lobsters, oysters, etc. ,  etc., and  increased  employment at betters The importation of frozen meat from Australia, NewZealand and Argentine has never interfered with profitscf home farmers and therefore there is no reason whyBritish trade should fear -effect of importation cfchilled Dominion catches.
             wages.    I do  not  think the  long shore  fishermen             wor Icing in small open boats  or men engaged  in salmon             fisheries can  he brought under State  control  to  the             same extent as the crews of  trawlers  and drifters;  but             when the State invests  money in  increasing  the             productivity of inshore waters and rivers it  has a             right to protect its  expenditure by exercising control             over fishing operations, and to  derive  profit&quot;by issuing             licenses to fish.The profit   (17)     I am  not  in  a  position  to form any opinion to the State,  about  the availability of ocean transport  and can only             theorise on wbht material I  have.   Taking,  as I  have             already dene,  pre-war landings,  pre-war consumption of             fish, pre-war  and  present consumption of meat an             Importation of 1,500,000 tons is necessary  to make good             the  deficiency of  meat.   A tax of one-halfpenny  on the             lb.  cf  Dominion fish  would produce  7.,000 ,000 and of             one  penny  14,000,000.   A penny  on the  lb*  could be             charged and Newfoundland fish sold to tho consumer at            .6d*  or  7d.  a lb.    Moreover  there  is  a  big  opportunity             for  a great re-export trade  with foreign countries,             which would benefit the State directly  by a greatly             increased yield of the  penny or  half-penny  on the lb. ,             and  indirectly by  its effect upon the balance of trade             (18)     These suggestions are,  of course.,  open  to all             the  stock x^ arguments  against State  ownership,  State             control,, or  State  interference in any way with individual-             ism  in  industry, trade  and eounerce.    Without going into             the  general question, I  would submit-  (1) That armaments            will be reduced, and&apos;that the necessity for an adequate            naval reserve  in civil  employment  increases in inverse            proportion to  the  reduction  of armaments.   (2)   That             the  State  must for  some  years exercise  control&apos;over the            production,  transports.-:ion and distribution of food.             (3 )   That  control  over  fisheries can  be exercised with             less difficulty than  over any other source  of supply of            foods    There  are  no  vested  interests in the  sea*            Territorial  waters  are  the property of  the  State-.   The            few  private  interests involved .oan be respected  without            prejudice  to the main question.     So  can angling rights            on rivers  selected  for  the cultivation  of salhon though            they would have  to be controlled^   (4)  That  the            problem is  comparatively simpler     There is no rent            to pay,  no  laborious  and uncertain processes  of            cultivation  to be undertaken.  The  food is  there  to            hand/ and there  is  no private ownership in  it.    All            that  the State  has  to do is  to make sure that  it  is not            wasted;  to bring the producer and tho  consumer  close            to pother with  advantage  to thou  and with profit  to the            State.            (10)     This  is a big proposition.   The world requires            a huge  supply  of fish to  meet the  shortage  of  othor            kinds of flesh food.   If we  do  not know it other            nations do.    Germany is making  strenbus efforts  to            create  a fishing industry;   pranoe, Holland,  the            Scandinavian countries are &quot;busy  re-organising their            fisheries;   we  are  admirably situated geographically            to do a vast business in fish.    Our  fishing  population            are  to  say the  least  of  it second  tonone.   I would            like to  see  their number trebled for  they are  a most            valuable asset  to the State-    But  our  industry  unassist-
ed, left in its present inchoate condition, cannot possibly conpeto with the fishing industries of othercountries wisely assisted &quot;by their States.   We shalldrag along, as we always have done, doing a ridiculouslysnail business in view of our exceptionally goodopportunities..   We shall lose the opportunity ofsecuring and maintaining a groat trader(20)     I should like in conclusion to emphasize thefact that what is wanted is administrative action andnot further investigation.   A mass of readilyaccessible statistics, British, Colonial and American,exists now.   Coixdssions and Committees have examineaand reported upon the Pish question almost ad nauseam*What is needed now is not data but a policy based uponavailable data and a state department to carry that policy out-(sgd.)
