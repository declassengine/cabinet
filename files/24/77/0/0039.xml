THIS memorandum deals with:       1.  The political causes of the disorders in Germany.      2.  The National Assembly at Weimar and the German Constitution.      3.  The quarrel of the Extreme Socialists with the Government and the Assembly.      4.  The assassination of Kurt Eisner in Munich and the situation there.      5.  Spartacism and disorders in different German centres  and in the mining            districts.  Successful military measures.      6.  The suppression of the latest Berlin disorders.      7.  Emergency socialistic legislation to placate extreme opinion.  Regulation of           . the production and sale of coal.                The fight between Moderate and Extreme Socialism.      1.  The lull in  the Spartacist operations  in Berlin  which  was the immediate sequel of the suppression of  the insurrection in the middle of January did not last long.   The convocation  of  the  National Constituent  Assembly  at Weimar  was described by the extremists as a flight from Berlin, and the more turbulent elements of the population were doubtless taught to regard it in that light.      The activities of the National Assembly during the past  weeks, which  were mainly concerned with the discussion of a new, definitive constitution for the German Empire, have been represented in Germany and elsewhere as idle debating.      In  reality very useful and indispensable work was being done.   But the foreign press, which generally takes a superficial view of German affairs,  has unintentionally encouraged the attacks which are being made by the Spartacists upon the methods and principles of ordered government.     It was supposed by some observers that with the capture of central Berlin by the Government troops, with the arrest of the Bolshevist Radek,  the flight ol the Spartacist Prefect of Police, Eichhorn, to Brunswick, and the violent deaths of Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, the Spartacist movement in Berlin had collapsed. It soon became evident that the organisation had survived, and that it was ready to take advantage of any serious recrudescence of discontent among the working-classes and the numerous unemployed.  Many minor Russian agents remained in Berlin and were able to carry on their propaganda in the northern and eastern districts of the city.  As a matter of fact, isolated disturbances and fusillades hardly ever ceased. Those of the middle classes who  had still money to  spend remained indifferent to these manifestations, but this is characteristic of Berlin.   There was more feasting in restaurants  and more all-night dancing than ever.  The desperate discontent of the poor and the extreme frivolity of  those in better circumstances are explained by the most intelligent German observers as symptoms of the same disease.    The poor  think that they have nothing to  lose; those among the middle class who have still  something to  spend that  there  is nothing  more to  gain.   The outlook is regarded in both quarters as  hopeless, and is faced by the one class with desperate measures of revolt and by the other with cynical orgies of self-indulgence.  Yet it must not be forgotten that there is in Berlin a great number of serious- and sober- minded people who  can  only look on until the revolutionary  conflagration burna itself out.    2. There are special reasons for the enmity of a section of the  Berlin working-classes to the Weimar Assembly, the new Government, and the policy of republican.

  constitutionalism.    The  Spartacists  consider-and the  Independent  Socialists,  headed by Haase, have adopted their view-that the action of Ebert, Scheidemann,  and the most of the Majority Socialists is calculated to sacrifice the real objects of  the revolution.   These are declared to be the establishment of the working classes in  power and the socialisation of all the instruments of  production.   The Majority  Socialists, on the other  hand,  or the most of them,  came to  the conclusion, as far  back as  the time of their Party Congress at Wurzburg, October 1917, that nothing  could be more inopportune than to attempt extensive socialisation in the condition  of disorganisation and impoverishment to which Germany  has been brought by the  war.  ^ As  it was put: &quot; In order to have socialisation, there  must be something to  socialise.&quot;    It was frankly declared  at the Wiirzburg Conference by  prominent  Majority Socialists that they must revise their doctrines with regard to the: bane-  fulness of the capitalist system, because, for one thing, all the assistance that capital  could give would be needed to repair the economic havoc wrought by the war.   This  view  was shared by some even of the Minority Socialists, and Kautsky, their chief  literary  exponent, published a pamphlet combating the  doctrine,  alleged  to  be  Marxist, of the &quot; proletarian dictatorship,&quot; as a  necessary stage in the Socialist  revolution.  It is, moreover, evident that without a dictatorship, such as has been  set up by Lenin and Trotsky, immediate and wholesale socialisation could not even  be attempted.   And the German working-classes are well aware of what a Bolshevist  dictatorship means;     3. The formation of the new republican  Government at Weimar intensified the  hostility of the extreme revolutionaries in Berlin and elsewhere.   The new  leading  personages are Majority Socialists.  Ebert was elected President  of the Republic  and Scheidemann President of the Ministry of the Empire.   But this is  not all.  The Government is a coalition of  Majority  Socialists, Radical  Democrats, and  Catholic Centre politicians.  It is thus partly bourgeois, and embraces men  like the  able and active Catholic Erzberger and the author of the draft republican consti-  tution, the Democratic Radical  Professor Hugo Preuss.  The cry was raised that  the citadel of Socialism had been betrayed.  Moreover, contrary to the reports which  have appeared in the English press, great debating ability was  displayed in the  Assembly precisely  by leading bourgeois speakers, like  Preuss  and  Professor  Schiicking.  The Assembly  was therefore described as a mere reproduction of the old Reichstag, and as assertions of this kind fitted in with the attitude of powerful  sections of Allied opinion,  they were widely reproduced in  the Allied Press.     4. Meanwhile,  economic distress, scarcity of food,  of clothing, and of all the necessaries of  life, combined with industrial idleness, due to apathy, underfeeding, and the lack of coal and other raw materials,  contributed to  produce in  the  large towns the atmosphere  in which desperate enterprises are bred.   Before the latest insurrection had ripened in Berlin, there were grave  social  convulsions in  other German cities.  In Munich the leader of the revolution and Socialist President of the Ministry, Kurt Eisner, was assassinated on the 21st February by a young monarchist, Count Arco-Valley, while he was on his way to the first meeting of the  Bavarian Constituent Assembly, in order to  resign his provisional powers and those of his ministry  into the Assernbly&apos;s hands.  The murder was  immediately followed  by a wild-west orgy of shooting in the Assembly itself, where Auer, the Minister of the Interior and leader of the Moderate Socialists, was very seriously wounded, and the Catholic  Deputy Osel  was shot dead.   These outrages were doubtless arranged by the small but determined section of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils which is led by  the Russian-Jewish Bolshevist, Levien, who desired at all costs to prevent the formation  of a moderate Socialist Government, such as Auer  would probably have formed.   The effect of these sensational events was  to alarm the populace and to  renew  the revolutionary aspect of the streets.  The number of real Spartacists in  Munich is,  nevertheless, reported to be very small.  In Bavaria they are really confined to cities like Munich, Augsburg, and Nuremberg; the population of the country  districts,  as has  been shown by  the results  of  the elections  for the Constituent assembly, is Catholic and Conservative.   Even in the Munich Congress of Workmen&apos;s  and Soldiers&apos; Councils a motion proposed by Levien and the Sparta- cist Muhlsam on the 28th February (i,e.,aweek after the assassination of Eisner) for establishing a  Soviet Republic was rejected by 234 votes to  70.  No doubt  a Committee&apos;of 33 was at the same time appointed to act  on  behalf of the  Congressas a provisional sovereign Assembly&quot; during the &quot;adjournment&quot; of the recentlyelected-Constituent Assembly,  this  &quot;adjournment&quot; is rightly  described  in  a
   protest issued by the Bavarian members of the Weimar National Assembly as due to   the violence done to the Deputies on the 21st February.  It is further reported that   the new provisional ministry  which is  proposed  by the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&quot;   Councils is of a moderate description,  being  in  fact a coalition of the Majority   and Minority  Socialists, and  again comprehending the two  bourgeois ministersg Jaffe (Finance ( and Frauendorfer (Communications). Deplorable as events in Munich   have been,  it would seeem to be a mistake to regard the capital of Bavaria as given   over to Spartacism  or  Bolshevism.  The claim of the Workmen&apos;s  and Soldiers&apos;   Councils in Munich is only to control the Government and to  have a voice in its   nomination-an awkward  claim no doubt, but an intelligible  one  in view  of the   part which these Councils  played in carrying through the Revolution.       5. Other German centres, besides Berlin, where Spartacism has been  rife and   has obtained temporary control, are dusseldorf, Leipzig, Halle, Brunswick, Bremen,   Hamburg,  Wilhelmshafen, and Konigsberg. In the Ruhr district at Duisberg and   Mulheim the chief activities of the Spartacists were devoted to  the promotion of   strikes among the  miners.  V iolent methods were employed, and the terrorism was   only stopped by the  arrival of Government troops, who had  to quell the Spartacist   bands  by machine-gun lire.       At dusseldorf  the  Spartacists obtained  complete control of the municipal   administration  and  appointed  a burgomaster  from  their  own ranks.   The   representatives of  law and order took refuge on the other side of the Rhine, where   the Belgians are in occupation.  There was great distress among the inhabitants of   the isolated city until the Government  troops after an engagement, in which the   local Spartacists are said to have exhibited great cowardice, occupied the  place on   the 28th February and re-established  orderly administration.       At Halle Spartacism in an extreme form was for a time dominant.  This was   one of the places  where, in reply to a universal strike of the working classes, the   professional and middle classes stopped  work in order to hoist the Spartacists with   their own petard.  Doctors, for example, refused to attend patients except in extreme   cases.   Halle was occupied  by the  Government troops  on the  1st  March,  but   disturbances and sporadic encounters took place for some time after this date.       The city of Bremen was for many weeks at the mercy of the local Spartacists,   who armed the workmen and treacherously captured and disarmed a local regiment   which  had returned home from the western front.  Here, too, a force of Government   troops had to take the place by assault on the 4th February, and some damage was   done by artillery.       The Spartacist movements in Bremen, Hamburg, and Wilhelmshafen seem; to   have maintained  a  certain connection with  one another.   In Hamburg,  owing   perhaps to the less inflammable character of the population, which in many respects   resembles that of English eastern seaport towns, the rule of the sailors and soldiers   seems to have been exercised without any great display of violence and to have been   provisionally acquiesced in by  the former State authorities and by the wealthy com-   mercial classes.  A boatswain, named Heise, who became the leader of the revolution,   declared himself a  firm opponent of Russian Bolshevism.   He wanted to fraternise   with the British Navy.  The Hamburg Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos;, and Workmen&apos;s  Councils   at a later stage determined to send military help to the Spartacists at Bremen, but   the promptness of  the Berlin Government&apos;s action frustrated this design.       At Wilhelmshafen there was a good  deal of local fighting and at times war-   vessels in the harbour are said to have joined in the conflict.  Of late there has been   little news  from this naval port and it is not known whether order has  been re-   established.       At Brunswick the Government,  as a  result of the elections for the  State   Assembly, fell into the hands of the Minority Socialists, who for a time succumbed   to the  authority of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils.  The leading spirit of   the provisional Government was the  Minority Socialist  Oerter,  who initiated an   ambitious  scheme  for  an autonomous North-Western  Confederation of  Soviet   Republics which was to embrace Saxony, Thuringia. Hesse, Westphalia with the   Rhineland, Hanover with East Frisia, Bremen, Brunswick, Hamburg with Schleswig-   Holstein, and finally the Prussian Altmark together with Anhalt and the northern   part of the Prussian Province of Saxony.  In the last week of January a conference   of the  members of  the popular Assemblies of such existing States as are involved in   this scheme together with delegates from  their Workmen&apos;s  and Soldiers&apos; Councils   met at Brunswick.   T^e programme was that the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils   should everywhere  be acknowledged to hold supreme political power.  The proposed   North-Western Confederation was to declare  its  willingness to  reunite with  the         [11301-885                                                    B 2
rest of Germany so soon as the rest of Germany had recognised its Workmen&apos;s andSoldiers&apos; Councils as permanently supreme.  As might have been expected, nothinghas come of this ambitious scheme.  In Brunswick itself some kind of compromisewas effected towards the end of February.  It is said to be based upon a divisionof power in the Government between the&apos;Majority Socialists and the  Independentsor Minority.   The Soldiers&apos;  Councils are to be eliminated as  a political factor,  fbut the Workmen&apos;s Councils are to have the right of veto upon all the decisions ofthe Government.   The situation in Brunswick does not yet appear  to be settled on anything like a durable basis.  There are 31 more or less extreme Socialists in theNational Assembly, elected after  the Revolution,  but  there  are  also 29  bourgeoisDemocrats who will not allow their interests to be completely ignored.    At Konigsberg, the important capital of the province of East Prussia and theancient eastern outpost of the  Prussian Monarchy, local Spartacists recently gainedthe upper hand, but it  is reported that they have now been expelled  from the public buildings  and that the regular provincial administration has been re-established.    In the Silesian colliery districts Spartacist efforts to provoke  strikes met fora time with considerable success, but the worst is now believed to be over.  Accordingto  German accounts  the  troubles  were  fostered  by  Polish  agents  employingBolshevist  methods.  When this plot was exposed,  the influence- of  the  agitationceased.  In so far as the Silesian district is still supplying a diminished quantityof coal at the pit mouth, this is said to be due to the slackness of the miners, which.is a result of underfeeding and of the general listlessness and apathy.    6. The latest  accounts from Berlin  in the  middle of March are to the effectthat the Spartacist rising  has once more been  quelled, this  time at  the  cost of agood many casualties-it is said at least 1,000 and of considerable destruction of buildings  by the artillery of the Government  troops.  The fighting was mostly inthe Alexanderplatz, a streefs length east of the Royal Castle  and Spree and in eastern working-class district  of Lichtenberg, where the Spartacists made  their final stand.  It is asserted that the Government troops fired wildly  in any streetwhere a Spartacist had so much as discharged a pistol from a window or whereany incident of this kind was merely reported to have occurred.   These proceedings are compared with what took  place in Belgian towns during the German advance.Their  result is said to have been that  many innocent persons  were  killed in the streets. A. novel  feature of revolutionary warfare was the employment  of bombing-aeroplanes by both sides,  it is alleged.   This added  a new horror to  the conflictand at one or two points caused serious loss of life.  It should be noted that theresidential west-end of Berlin, with the exception of  the district round about theReichstag  building, seems to have  been entirely exempt from  the effects of the conflict. There was a great deal of looting, but it took place in  streets east of theAlexanderplatz.    The Government  troops,  drawn mostly  from the Guards cavalry, were  com-manded by General von Liittwitz.  (He was formerly personally known to the writerof this report, was some years before the war military attache at Petrograd, and inthe later stages of the war  was military Governor of  Brussels.  He is a  quietman of moderate views. Baroness Liittwitz is an American who has many personalfriends at Washington.)   The energy  with which the rising  was suppressed is mainly due to  the Socialist Governor Noske,  who had already given proof of hisfirmness and resource by getting the turbulent sailors and the garrison at Kiel wellin hand during the early weeks of the Revolution last November.  Noske runs the constant risk of assassination,  and the  street in which he  lives in  the west-endof Berlin is guarded by pickets of troops.   The Prussian War Minister, ColonelReinhardt, has also proved&apos; himself efficient in the organisation  of the Governmentforces.    7. It is impossible at present to say whether the danger of Spartacism in Berlin-and throughout Germany has  been finally arrested.^    According to some statements disaffection continues to smoulder and may&apos;break-out again in the form  of a general strike affecting the greater part of the country.The object of the strike would be to secure an ampler measure of socialisation thanthat which the Government under  the pressure of  insurrection has laid before the[National Assembly at  Weimar.  The Government Bill declares:     (1.) Every German must exercise his bodily and mental powers in the manner           demanded by the welfare of the whole community.  The forces of Labour,           as the highest economic resources of the nation, are under the protection           of *^e  Empire.  The Empire affords to every German the possibility of
           maintaining himself by work corresponding to his capacities.  In so far           as he is unable to find work, means of support  will be supplied him in           accordance with a special Imperial law,     (2.) It is the business of the Empire to transfer  economic enterprises and           values, in particular mineral wealth and natural sources  of  power, to           the common German economic organisation  (&quot; Gemeinwirtschaft&quot;), and           also regulate the production  and the maintenance of economic goods for           the common German economic organisation for the benefit of the Empire,           its States, communes, or associations of communes.     (3.) Tne German common  economic organisation will be managed by economic           self-administering bodies.  These self-administering bodies will be under           the surveillance of the Empire.  The Empire, in  carrying out this           surveillance, may avail itself of the official machinery of the separate           States.     (4.) In execution of the prerogatives contemplated by (2), the exploitation,           from the point of view of the common economic organisation, of com-           bustibles, of water power and other natural sources  of energy, and of           the motive power derived from them, will be secured by a special Imperial           Law.   In the meantime, for one special branch, the coal industry,  a           law  for  the  regulation  of  the  coal  trade   will   come into  force           simultaneously with the present law.     This extraordinary production bears all the marks  of an emergency measure and must be the work of inexperienced  draftsmen, Socialist Ministers perhaps.   Itwas promptly followed by /the promised  Bill for the regulation of  the coal industry.This Bill contains the following provisions:      (a.) The management of the coal trade will be transferred to an  Imperial Coal           Office,  which is  to be constituted.     (&amp;.) The Imperial Government will unite the coal production for particular         t  districts in the hands of associations, which will be embraced in a general           association.  The business of the associations  is to regulate production,           consumption,  and sale  under the control of the Imperial  Coal  Office.           The  Imperial Government  exercises   supreme  control and  regulates           prices.     (c.) Before the  regulation,  contemplated as above  (a.),  is introduced,  the           Imperial Government must convoke a  Council of Experts,  consisting of           45 members.  Of these, 15 are to be employers and 15 miners.  Two of           the employers are to be appointed by the Prussian Minister for  Commerce           and Industry.   The rest are to be elected in accordance  with detailed           arrangements by groups of employers and groups of workmen belonging           to the Chambers of Labour.   The remaining 15  members of the Council           of Experts are to be  nominated by the Imperial Government.   Three           of them are to be taken from commercial circles, two  from the class of        -   those who are employed in technical and one from the class of  those who           are employed in commercial  posts; six from the class  of consumers; and           one each from the classes of mining experts, coal prospectors, and experts           in communications and transport.     (d.) The Imperial Government, with the  assent of the States Committee (the           present substitute for the Federal Council),  will issue detailed orders           for carrying out this law.   The Government may  decree  that  con-           traventions shall be punished  by a  maximum fine  of  Mks.  100,000           ( 5,000), and, in case of a second contravention, by the additional penalty           of imprisonment not exceeding one year.     These  Bills represent the extent  to which  the German Government, underpressure of events, is at present prepared to go in the direction of the socialisation of industry. Vague prospects are also held out of  the recognition of the Workmen&apos;sCouncils as future organs of industrial administration.  In the  Weimar assembly the  Imperial Secretary of State  for the Interior, Professor Preuss,  has declaredany recognition of the Workmen&apos;s or the Soldiers&apos; Councils as legislative bodies tobe &quot;out of the question.  The Spartacists, of course,  and, in sympathy with them.the Independent Socialists, demanded much wider measures of socialisation..  these demands embrace the immediate socialisation of all capitalistic enterprises, includingj
large estates and forests; the requisition of all unused  dwellings; the confiscationof all fortunes made  during the war and the imposition of  specially heavy taxeson  all large fortunes; the extension of the system of Workmen&apos;s  Councils andtheir recognition in the Constitution;as administrative  and legislative bodies; theelection of judges and administrative authorities by the people; and the immediateresumption of diplomatic  relations  with the Russian  Soviet Republic  and with 0Poland.     P.S. The general Socialisation  Bill and the Coal Industry Bill were passed inthe second week  of  March by the  National Assembly, with  amendments whichmaterially modify their original provisions.   Thus, in clause 2 of the SocialisationBill, the  important words, &quot;in exchange for suitable  compensation,&quot; have been introduced.  Clause 3 is remodelled  so as to make the management of the contem-plated economic  organisation  more  specifically  the business of the  Empire,  the separate States and the local administration.  Economic self-administering bodies are only mentioned in the  fourth place, amd the provision subjecting them to sur-veiilance by the Empire is retained.     In  the Goal  Industry Bill the National Assembly has made alterations in  the.section  (c) whi h deals with the composition of the contemplated Council of Experts.Instead of 45, it is to consist of 50  members, and 20 of these are to be nominated by the Government from various interested classes, representing chiefly the consumers.The detailed regulations  to be issued by the Government for carrying out the CoalIndustry  Law have to be laid before the National Assembly, and have to be with-drawn if  the National Assembly demands their  withdrawal  within a  month after they have been submitted.     It seems improbable that, in the present condition of Germany, there is sufficientdriving-power in the  Government or sufficient cohesion  among the different classes.of the community to enable a law of this kind to be carried into effect.o
