Mr. Chapman said that the Coal Controller  and the TimberController were  both strongly against  removing pitwood control,.but chat they were prepared to modify it.    The Chairman said in these circumstances it would be advisable-for him to discuss  the  matter with  the  Coal Controller and the timber Controller, and he asked Mr. Chapman to  arrange with themto see him the next day, and for him to be  present as well.Paper.Control:          o  With  reference to  Minute  4 (j)  of  the  7th  Meeting,,No-Returns Order.   Mr,  Chapman said that Sir Albert Stanley was  particularly anxious-                 that t e Paper Restrictions (No  Returns Order) 1918 should  not be                 revoked for the present.

    The Chairman  said that he felt unable to alter the decision without discussing the matter with Sir Albert Stanley, and he sug-gested that Mr. Chapman should ask Sir Albert to be present at themeeting  with  the  Coal Controller  and the Timber Controller  onpitwood, when this matter could also be discussed.     3, Mr. Chapman, said that, although  he considered  the organi-sation for  the  control of  road  transport  could  he reduced  to  aminimum, it was desirable that it should  be maintained, and it was proposed that it should be transferred to the Board of Trade with aview  to  subsequent transfer to the new Ministry of  Ways and communications.   The maintenance of the organisation was alsovery desirable just now in view of the railway trouble.    It was decided     That the machinery of control over  road transport should be        maintained.     4. Mr, Chapman said that the re-export and entrepot trade was of great importance in this country.   It had been destroyed duringthe war, and it was essential that it should be revived as quickly aapossible.  The Treasury refused to agree to freedom of  import intothis country for  the purpose  of re-export, as it was calculated tovitiate their support of the foreign Exchanges.  The Board of trade were extremely anxious to restore this trade which was in form partlytrans-shipment and  part entrepot  Mr. Chapman pointed out  thatthe Liverpool cotton market was maintained  because it was possibleto hold large stocks in Liverpool, as there had been a big re-exporttrade in cotton ; but if the re-export trade was lost this country wouldprobably lose the  cotton market.  He thought that the proper thing to do was for the  Treasury to let the exchanges go.  The rates ofexchange were  purely fictitious,  as the real par was, at  any rate, inthe case of  the  American Exchange  far below the  figure  to whichthe rate was kept.     Mr.  McFadyean pointed  out that the question of ceasing tosupport the American Exchange, which was the only one at present being supported  directly, was not only a financial one,  as political considerations  entered  into  the  case  as  well.   So long  as theChancellor  of  the   Exchequer  felt  it  necessary  to support  theAmerican Exchange, he would not be willing to sanction unrestrictedre-export in  articles of American origin.   Unrestricted  re-exportmight  result in a  considerable proportion  of the  commodities inquestion being sent from this country to France, Italy, and  Belgium,which in effect  would mean that we were borrowing money  in theUnited States in order to lend it to our Allies.  The withdrawal of support would simplify the problem, though it would not necessarilyprevent the  re-export  of  American  goods to our  Allies  and  the consequent  burden  on  the sterling  exchange.   The  amount of re-export of this nature would then depend upon the comparativeease with which the Allied trader could raise credit in  the  UnitedStates and in this  country.  He pointed out,  further,  that  it  wasonly a limited amount of re-export trade which was being hampered by the financial considerations alluded to.     The Chairman said he understood that American traders  were giving longer credits to the French.  The American Governmenthad decided to  give no credits to France except in respect of ordersfor American goods  placed by the French Government.  He askedwhether  we  were losing  much of the trade that  formerly went through England, by reason of this  arrangement between Americaand France.
    Sir Percy Bates was of opinion that we were not losing much.He thought  it was cheaper for the  French to&apos; import  into  thiscountry by reason of the British freight rates being lower.    The Conference then  considered some articles which were thesubject of re-export and  entrepot,  and it was  stated incidentallythat there was a surplus of rubber in this country.    Mr. Amery said, in regard to rubber, that the only restrictions were those which  prevented the  export to the  blockade  countrieswhich  were very greatly in need of the material, and for  which wewere the natural entrepot.    Lord Inverforth wag  of opinion that the proper course was to open the markets in respect of all  these materials, and he did notthink this would cause a slump, but he would not recommend doing this until the blockade was lifted.    The Chairman  said that the question before them was as towhether it was probable that our re-export and entrepot trade wouldbe helped if it were decided that support should  be withdrawn from foreign exchanges.  He said it was necessary to consider not onlyraw materials, but also manufactured  goods.   The point that wasvery strongly before him was that this country appeared to  have a chance of  having  a  larger  entrepot  trade   than  ever  before.Germany would have  no long  credits,  but would  require  rawmaterials (in fact, the whole of  Europe was short of raw materials),and it would  be  possible for  this  country with  foresight  and enterprise to hold  stocks of materials and to build up a very largeentrepot trade.    Sir Percy Bates pointed out that if this support were withdrawnthe exports  from  the  Empire  generally to America would  be stimulated.   He  was  strongly in  favour  of   withdrawing t esupport..    Mr. Chapman agreed and pointed out the effect it would have in addition in the  way  of simplifying the import restriction policy,as  once the Treasury ceased.supporting the foreign exchanges theywould  have no reason for  asking that imports should be restricted.    Lord  Emmott said that all.  the advice  he  had received frombusiness men and  others was in the same  direction.    Lord Inverforth was  of opinion that there was no other course open but to withdraw this support from the exchanges.    Mr. Illingioorth agreed, but he was not sure as  to how far itwas wise to do this before the blockade was lifted ; he thought this appeared  a  point which required  careful  consideration.   Apartfrom the question  of blockade, he had  no hesitation in letting theexchanges go.     The  Chairman agreed  with  Mr.  Chapman  that one of  theeffects of this would  be  that  restrictions  on imports  would  beremoved except in the case, of manufactured goods  not essential tothe needs of the country.   Carrying this  policy into effect mightwork  hardships in certain cases, but it was essential for the generalbenefit of trade in this country that the step should  be taken, andin the long run it would  have nothing but beneficial effects.   Hethought,  therefore, that strong representations  should be  made tothe Chancellor of  the Exchequer drawing  his  attention  to thecommercial advantages which would result from the discontinuance of the present policy of artificially maintaining  the exchanges.     Mr. McFadyean said that he thought that the Chancellor of the Exchequer  would  welcome such a  recommendation  from  the Conference.
It was agreed-That the War Cabinet should be asked to give an early decision    as  to whether the political or  other  advantages of  the    policy of  supporting  foreign  exchanges  outweigh  its      $    manifest commercial disadvantages.It was also agreed-That it should be  an instruction to  the  Board  of Trade that       ^   - they should urge the Port of London Authorities  to take    immediate measures to assist and encourage the tranship-    ment trade in  every possible way.Cables and Com-inunications.    5. Mr.  lllingworth referred to a Memorandum which he had prepared for the Chairman on the subject of  Cables  and  Com-munications, and drew attention to the  difficulty he was experiencingin obtaining the demobilisation of men required for his services.He also drew attention to the manner in which he was limiting theGovernment priority on  cables and  telephones in order that  every possible  hindrance in the way of trade improvement  should beremoved.GoreinmentControl.    6. Mr. Chapman said he was not at all certain that all controlshad been considered by the Conference, and  he thought that steps should be taken to ascertain what controls there were outstanding.    The Chairman instructed the Secretary to take the necessary action for ascertaining if any, and, if  so what,  controls were still outstanding.    The Chairman said in reply to Mr. Chapman that, in deciding to remove controls, the intention was that the Control Orders shouldbe revoked and not merely suspended.(Initialled)    A. C. G.o
