CONFIDENTIAL.POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,          FOREIGN OFFICE.                    ITALY /010.[March 20,1919.]   (11134..).U (-) o1MEMORANDUMONITALIAN PRESS  COMMENTS  ON  CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. The Question of the German Colonies.     THE Correspondents of the &quot; Giornale d&apos;Italia &quot; were quick to seize upon two points first, that President Wilson&apos;s advocacy of the  League of Nations was  k)be something more than &quot; eye-wash &quot; (this discovery seems to have come as a sur-prise) ;  secondly,  that  the  divergence which manifested itself  on this questionbetween French opinion on  the one  hand and British and American on the othermight be  exploited to Italy&apos;s advantage.   The  problem was how to reconcile thepushing of Italy&apos;s  claims with the necessity, now recognised as paramount, of pro-pitiating the Americans.  The solution proposed is on the one hand to gain meritwith Wilson by backing the &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; view on colonial and extra-Europeanmatters or playing the  part of  mediator, and on.the other  to establish a sort  of alliance with France-Ja &quot;Latin Union&quot; with  a  view to  mutual support andexclusion  of the &quot;  14 points &quot; from European territorial questions.     Thus, on January 27th, Vettori, correspondent of  the  &quot;Giornale&quot; in Paris,writes (&quot; Giornale d&apos;Italia,&quot; January  29)   that  the only  burning questions  ofEuropean territorial character are for France that of the Saar basin, for Italy--.those of Fiume and Dalmatia.   It was a matter of bringing the national points  ofview of  France and Italy into harmony with American principles,   japan&apos;s atti-tude was  very  simple;   it consisted in backing up France and Italy in Europe,  inorder to obtain their support in Asia.   Great Britain&apos;s line was  determined  for  it by the definite  agreements concluded with France  and  Italy agreements  which british good faith  could be  counted  on to observe.   British policy  in Europe wasvery clear, and consisted in maintaining the British-French-Italian coalition.   TheBritish Government would not  be likely to raise many objections to the territorialsettlements desired by  Paris and Rome.   Everything,  therefore, would turn  on president Wilson&apos;s judgment, and his sole preoccupation was to create a situationin Europe which should guarantee peace,  as far as  that was possible, by removingoccasions  for fresh  conflicts a view which  coincided entirely with the territorialaspirations of Ita.lv aiming, as  they did, at two  things only, viz.:  (1) properfrontiers and (2) elimination of Italian irredentism.    The correspondent concludes by expressing  his confidence that &quot; the work  ofhonorable persuasion of the  Americans is  proceeding satisfactorily.&quot;    On  February 3 (&quot; Giornale d&apos;Italia,&quot; February 4) he writes :   &quot; The Frenchpapers frankly  recognise that so far the resolutions taken by the Conference are notin accordance with French views, and that between the energy of Clemenceau andthe tenacity of Wilson the final victory was with the latter,  given especially theattitude of Lloyd George.   The natural consequence is a French  diplomatic move-men t in order to be in a better  position  to  face  the further developments of theConference.    &quot; The first movement of the French  is towards  England, but here it finds an obstacle in the internal policy of Llovd George, who goes so far as to defv the wrathof the &apos; Dominions &apos; in order not to offend British Labour, which verv definitely takes the side of Wilsonian ideas.  .  .  . French diplomacy, however,  sticks to its gunsand  continues to work upon the British  Government, trying  to balance the nobleidealism of Wilson with a realistic view of the situation.     &quot; Further, in  French political circles a  more pronounced tendency is noticedto recognise the identity of  French and Italian  interests in Continental  Europeanmatters. It would seem that it is gradually coming to be recognised that French effortsp]30]-4l7B
have been too exclusively devoted to reordering the Danubian chaos and to reconcilinginterests which for the moment are irreconciieable, such as those of  Italy and the jugo-Slavs, and has thus lost sight of the necessity for a more  intimate collabora-tion with Italy in order that the two countries may be united in face of the Europeanterritorial questions.  .  . .  This tendency towards a better understanding exists on both sides;  but it must not be forgotten that Wilson&apos;s position at the conference is very strong, and cannot be  radically  changed by any diplomatic combination though of that there is, of course, no question.  Rather, we have to work at adaptingAmerican ideals to European reality. ...&quot;     Writing  on  the  same  date,  Vettori discusses  (&quot; Giornale  d&apos;Italia,  February  5th) what  he calls &quot; Wilson&apos;s first.victory.&quot;   &quot; Until a  few days ago,&quot; hewrites, &quot; it had not been foreseen that the Society of Nations, whose statute has notyet been drafted, would at  once be declared capable of holding property.&quot;   But thegreat surprise had been the position taken up by Mr. Lloyd George,  The &quot; Echode  Paris &quot; and other  French papers enlarged on this theme, noting that thoughClemenceau publicly ranged himself on the side of Lloyd George on the fundamentalBritish  question  of  sea-power,  Lloyd   George  had not  adequately  supportedClemenceau on other questions.   &quot; In all quarters in Paris it is recognised that france is left to confront America single-handed.&quot;     &quot;  It is a fact.  So far the American thesis has triumphed and Wilson has taken the lead at the Conference.   I repeat: America did not find the European Powersunited, and has split  that Franco-British &apos; bloc  &apos; which had seemed unbreakable.So  much so that it is observed by some that its place has  been taken by an Anglo-American Syndicate, a sort of league of the English-speaking nations.&quot;     President Wilson  counts on the prestige of his principles and on the popularenthusiasm which they have aroused.  &quot;Either  his principles are accepted at theConference or  he has no longer anything to keep him in Europe, and will take thefirst steamer for America.&quot;    The French fear that  the application of Wilson&apos;s principles may stand in theway of their taking adequate guarantees  against Germany.   &quot; These fears are farfrom being&apos;groundless; only they should have taken form a little earlier.   But thephenomenon &apos;  Wilson &apos; was not appreciated at its true value.  People believed that american idealism, would have contented  itself with vague and Platonic affirmationsof principle and that in concrete questions the European point of view would havehad no difficulty in asserting itself.&quot;     &quot;  What then is Italy&apos;s position under these  circumstances?   It is not easy to answer the question, the subject being  a  very delicate one.&quot;   France and Englandhaving already, by virtue of agreements  and in actual fact, divided  between them-selves the German Colonies in Africa, Italy&apos;s rights are merely rights to compensa-tion and her colonial policy one of balance of power-relative, not absolute.   Italy has, therefore, no  reason  to  oppose  the idea  of placing  the  German  Coloniesunder  the League of Nations, on which she will be one of the leading  members.  Asregards Turkey in Asia, so long as Italy  is given a share zone of influence or partin the  work of civilisation  (whichever it may be)  proportionate to her positionas a Great Power, it is a matter of  indifference to her  which system is adopted.  Somuch for Colonial and Turkish problems.     European Questions area  different matter.    Not even  Wilson would  think of applying his principles to territorial controversies in which the Great Powers ofEurope are concerned.The Hedjaz and Syria.     On February 8th  the statement of the Emir Faisul is reported  and discussed.&quot; The  Kingdom of the Hedjaz  was invented by the English in the middle of 1916.The claims of  the King of the Hedjaz a creature of the English conflict with theFrench programme of  expansion in Syria.  The formula of &apos; Aid &apos; is an attenuatedvariation of the Mandate,  and appears to have been created by Lloyd George forthe Arabic countries.  . . . Evidently the Emir Faisul is the mouthpiece of England,a fact  which  the  French papers unanimously emphasise,  referring to the entry ofthe Arab Emir on the  scene.to-day as  &apos; the Hedjaz Operetta.&apos; &quot;     The Italian attitude on this question, as on that of Asia Minor,  is one of indif-ference towards the formula adopted, so  long as Italy is given the place due to herand the Mediterranean Balance of Power is not altered to her disadvantage.
 Danubian Confederation.     On February 7 Vettori contributes an article on the &quot; Heirs of the Hapsburgs.&quot; For completing the ringing  in of Germany some people trust to Jugo-Slavia and a confederation of the States neighbouring the Danube.   But the various elements of Jugo-Siavia are at sixes and. sevens.  No trust can be placed in a State which will probably never be formed.   Nor can reliance be placed on a Danubian confederation- ticn.  Of the people who would compose it the only two who are on speaking terms are the Bohemians and the Jugo-Slavs an alliance between the man and the horse. The only sane course is  to rely upon France and Italy in combination with a strong Roumania-an alliance of Latin States.   As to  Rouma^ia, the writer is in com- piete agreement with Herbette in &quot; Le Temps.&quot;   Of course, the Slavs must also be taken into account,  but  not to the extent of weakening  any of the  three Latin nations Italy, for example, the natural guardian of the Adriatic.     On February 13 Vettori remarks that the difference of opinion between France and America which had manifested itself over the question of the Colonies and Asia Minor had reappeared  over the question of prolonging the Amistice and of the abolition of conscription.     On February 16 (Paris  February 14) the Constitution of the League of Nations is announced in. an article full of high-sounding phrases, almost fulsome glorifica- tion of Wilson and  exaggerated satisfaction  with  the League.  Vettori, however, hints what  the Nationalist  papers express openly, viz., that the League is  to be interpreted  as a definite proof of the solidarity of the Allies and of  their power to impose peace rather than as a true Fraternity of Nations.     With regard to German efforts to divide  the Allies and  to French opposition to the  union of  Austrian.  Germans with Germany,  the &quot; Giornale&apos;s &quot; correspondent (January 31) writes :   &quot;In view of this policy on the part of the Germans a duty is incumbent upon the  two  Latin nations which  will  have to  face the Teutonic menaces, the duty of being in agreement and  united a fond.     &quot; Let France take  her  due guarantees on the Rhine and Italy hers in. the Alps and on the Adriatic, and let both base their policy on the conviction  that 80 million Latins will not be too many to keep in check 80  million. Teutons.  To act other- wise would  be to commit suicide and further to deal a fatal blow to civilisation.     &quot; If Germany annexes  German-Austria her pressure towards the Adriatic will recommence.   And then it will be infinitely better  for the Latin coalition that certain essential Adriatic positions  should be held  and defended by a  great Power like Italy rather than by a  State of inconsiderable strength  and uncertain constitu- tion like  Jugo-Slavia.   &apos; Germany is still alive and Russia no longer exists,&apos; the &quot; Temps &apos; observed.   That  is a just observation, but the inference which flows from it is evident.&quot;     A propos of the Hedjaz and Syria, the &quot; Giornale&apos;s &quot;  correspondent writes as follows (&quot; Giornale d&apos;Italia,&quot; February 15) :    1  &quot;The French attitude to.,us has  certainly  improved, because  on one side it has given  up what we might call its universal character,  which aimed at a series of special ententes with  the various peoples of  Eastern Europe, and on the other side because it has understood the basic importance of the Great Powers and of  Italy as one of them.   Italy, it now. realises, is a decisive element in the European balance of  power and in the defence of the Western  and Continental democracies against the German danger and the great chaos of  the East.   Thus the justice of Italy&apos;s. aspirations has found fuller recognition on. the part of Frenchmen,  due also to the felt need for securing in face of the present European difficulties a solid base in the form of a Latin entente.&quot;     The  pause  occasioned  by  the.absence from  Paris of  President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George  seems  to  have  been employed by  the &quot; Giornale&apos;s&quot;  corre- spondents in promoting this French-Italian entente.     The  &quot; Giornale d&apos;Italia &quot; of February 17 contains a collection of declarations of amity for Italy made to  its correspondent by prominent Frenchmen-Deschanel, Viviani,  Painleve  and  others.   On February&quot; 24th  a further list-Henri  Robert&apos; Joseph Reinach, Jacques Bainville, Marcel Prevost, Paul Adam and others.     It has seemed -worth while to reproduce at some length the comments appearing in the &quot;Giornale  d&apos;Italia  &quot; on the successive  phases of  the  Peace Conference! because that journal, being  in close touch with the Italian Foreign Office (it is com- monly referred to in Italian papers as 1&apos;Organo Sonniniano),  mav be held to reflect       ! 11301-417  ......

 in some degree the spirit in which the Consulta approaches the settlement of inter- national questions.     The tone of the &quot;Giornale &quot; is in marked contrast with that of the Liberal and Radical Press of  Italy,  whose attitude towards the  League of Nations scheme is sincere and compatible with impartial and sometimes adverse criticism of what are regarded as its weak points in particular its failure to ensure adequate disarma- ment.   They are no less firm than  the  Government  and  Nationalist organs in asserting Italy&apos;s claim to Fiume,  but  are prepared to relinquish the Dalmatian mainland and deprecate me  (government&apos;s obstinate adherence  to the Treaty of London.  At the  same time,  papers like the &quot; Corriere della  Sera &quot;  and the &quot; Secolo &quot; are almost as loud as the Nationalist and Government Press in resenting the Jugo-Slav proposal for arbitration and extravagant programme of claims.     The &quot; Corrierehas taken a very decided line on the question of the Danube Confederation and the Czecho-Jugo-Slav Corridor,  and  vigorously  maintains against the French Nationalists the right of  German-Austria  to  unite itself with Germany.   &apos;&apos; We Italians, who are going to have a common frontier with the new.State, and  therefore ought to fear its aggrandisement  more than the French, are less  terrified by the union with Germany of the  German-Austrians than by that artificial construction  which the French  would like  to  substitute for the  Dual Monarchy.    In. France, as is well-known, they worked first to save Austria and then to create on its ruins a new Danube Federation in which the Slavs would be in a majority and would  constitute a menace for  Germany.   This calculation is false in every way.  Not only does it violate the principle of nationality, not only does it offend the supreme interests  of the Italians, but it does not  even favour the  interests of the French.  There are many good reasons why the new Federation would not necessarily be anti-German.&quot; &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;  leader,  February 19.     On March  14th it writes to the following effect: -It  has  been asserted lately in various quarters and with growing emphasis that complete and intimate accord exists  between  the Italian  delegations  and  *French  diplomacy.    We are  older friends of the French than some of the journals which make so much of this new accord, but we  should like to know what  it really amounts to.   If  it means that Italy and France are at one in trying to secure a fair partition of war burdens and recognition  of the  prior needs of France and Italy for help  from their richer Allies, we  should welcome  it sincerely.  If it means that France recognises  Italy&apos;s  right to Fiume while Italy joins  France in demanding just  and durable guarantees of European peace, we should welcome this  also.   But  does it  mean that  Italy is adopting France&apos;s imperialistic  and at the same time Utopian  programme and her plans for the destruction or bottling up of Germany ?  Does it mean that the Italian delegates have agreed ,to French  plans  for   German-Austria and the Danubian Federation in fact, to signing the death-warrant of Italy?   If  the  accord  is so complete and detailed  as is asserted, this would seem to be the case, since  we have heard nothing of France having renounced her disastrous designs.   Some assurance from the Government  is urgently required.   In spite  of the assertions of French papers that the Italian  plenipotentiaries  are  at  one  with  France in refusing to Austria the right of self-determination and as regards the formation of the Danubian Federation, we refuse to believe that for the sake of gaining a point in the game of territorial  rivalries  Italian Ministers can  have sacrificed the  one solid advantage which Italy  had gained by the war the political liberty obtained by the  downfall of Austria.     The. Giolittian and clerical  papers, in  some of which the pro-German tendency is pronounced, are very much  dissatisfied with the draft constitution of the League. &quot;La Stampa,&quot; for example  (February 16), writes that  &quot;if it was  desired really to make the League of Nations a fraternity of peoples, its founders should have had&quot; the courage not to  exclude  any nation from the Congress in which the destiny of mankind and at the same time that of the  excluded was to be decided.  In view of the prejudices which obscured and  injured it from the beginning, it was impossible that the Society of Nations should be other than what it is a larger alliance of peoples for the defence  Of their own  interests. .  . -Their interests  of to-day are joining certain nations together  in a Concert;  their interests  of  to-morrow may divide them.&quot;   In a further article (February  19)  &quot;  La Stampa &quot; openly  demands the inclusion of Germany, who,  &quot; enlarged  by Austria, remains  always a formidable enemy who might to-morrow claim revision of  the solutions now being given to the problems in which she is interested,&quot; and deplores the failure of Italy to assume in this question &quot;the position marked out for her by her history and her most vital
interests.&quot;   Too weak to aspire herself to primacy, she ought to have used all herefforts &quot; to oppose  any policy tending to consolidate the  old  supremacies  or tofacilitate the formation of new ones,&quot; either by pursuing a Balance of Power policy or by advocating a true Society of Nations in which- all supremacies would have dissapeared.  &apos;    &quot; II Tempo &quot; (February 17) protests against the impossible attempt to encloseGermany in a ring  of iron.   &quot; Those who dream in the 20th century of revivingthe slavery of ancient days under the terrible form of economic  strangulation, andthis in order to assure  to other peoples impossible supremacies and absurd  hege-monies, in defiance of geography and demography and of human solidarity itself such people must prepare themselves for fresh wars.   But these wars cannot beCommon sense  will  triumph.  It will triumph by summoning to take part in thenew compact victors and vanquished alike.   Yes,  the vanquished also.   But are there  as yet any vanquished?&quot;o
