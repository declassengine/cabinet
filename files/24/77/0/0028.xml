Thin Document is the  Property of notes  ON CLAUSES.                                    Clause 4.              Complaints by an officer  to the Army  Council under section          forty-two must at present in  all cases be referred  by the Army          Council  to  the  Sovereign.   It  is  proposed  to amend  this          section by providing that complaints may  be  dealt with by the          Army  Council without  so  referring  them,  whilst  preserving          intact the right of  an officer to insist upon his  complaint being          so referred.                                 Clauses 5 and 6.              These  clauses  make  the necessary provisions for enabling          minor charges against officers to be dealt with summarily, instead          of by court martial, retaining however  the right  to  claim  trial          by court martial except where the punishment is,  severe reprimand          or reprimand.                                    Clause 7.              This clause is consequential on the proposals subsequently          made in  clause 13, which, deals with the same  subject in another          manner.                                 Clauses 8 and 9,              These  clauses  enable the necessary  steps to be taken for a          periodical census  and  inspection of  the  horses  available  for          use in case  of emergency, and for preventing  the alienation of          horses during a period  of mobilisation.                                    Clause  10.               Under  the Army Act a  soldier sentenced to penal servitude&apos;!         and (in  most cases) to imprisonment must be  sent to&apos; serve  his          sentence in the United Kingdom, and it  is doubtful how far an          order  of the Secretary of State  under  section 131  (2)  of  the          Army Act  can modify  this  rule, in  relation  to men  born or          enlisted  in  the Dominions.               83-2                    a
(&quot;2  5    This clause makes it clear  that  members of;  the imperial forces enlisted in the Dominions  and sentenced to penal servitudeor imprisonment need not in all cases  serve  their sentence  inthe United  Kingdom, but serve  their sentence in the Dominionin question.                          Clause 11.    The maximum rates of deduction from pay under section 145were increased by the Army  Annual Act, 1918, but by an over-sight no power was taken to very  pre-existing orders as has usuallybeen  done  in the past when the rates  of deduction  are  raised.The present clause corrects  this  oversight.                           Clause 12.    The provisions, of  section 153 of  the  Army  Act imposespenalties on persons who induce  soldiers to   desert,  or  affordassistance,  &amp;c.  to deserters.   The  section does  not, at present,apply to officers.  The purpose of the present  clause is to makesection  153  apply  to officers  in the  same way as to soldiers, andto extend  the section  to absence  without leave  as well  as  todesertion.    The clause, so  far as absence  without  leave is  concerned,makes permanent a provision which has been effected during thewar by  Defence of the Realm Regulation 43B.                          Clause 13.    This clause  perpetuates certain  provisions of Regulations 27,42, 42A and  43A  of the Defence of  the  Realm regulations which  have  been found  valuable in  practice   and which it  isthought  desirable to continue   permanently.   The  penalty  is,however, less  severe than under  the Regulations.                          Clause 14.    This clause  amends section 156 of the Army  Act       [(1) by making  it an offence  to buy  arms, equipment,             clothing, &amp;c. from  any person whatsoever, and not             only  from an officer or soldier;      (2) by making it clear that the prohibition against dealings             in  the  property, &amp;c. of officers and  soldiers  relates
            only  to  property issued  to  them  as such, and does            not cover their own personal property;      (3) by providing expressly that the prohibition contained            in the clause does not cover dealings  in the effects            of  officers and soldiers who are  deceased, retired,            or  discharged,  so  long as  the  property was  their            own, and not the property of the state;]      (4) by  extending the  penalties for offences  under  sub-            section (2) in  the  same way as the penalties  under            subsection (1) were extended by the Army (Annual)            Act of 1915.                           Clause 15.    This clause perpetuates  the  provisions  of  Regulation 41 ofthe Defence  of the Realm regulations  as to  the unauthoriseduse of military decorations, Avound stripes &amp;c.                          Clause 16.    This  clause  corrects an error which occurred  during thepassage of  the Army Annual Bill of  1917 through the committee stage  in- the House of Commons.                          Clause 17.    The effect  of section  175 of the Army Act  is that officersof  the  territorial  force when relegated  to  the territorial force reserve  are subject to military  discipline at all times.    Under this  clause  such officers will be  subject to military discipline only when they are doing  duty with troops  who are for the time being subject to military law or  are ordered on duty  for which they are liable.                           Clause 18.    Section 179A of the Army Act provides, amongst other things,that where an officer or airman of  the air force is attached  toor  seconded for service  with the army, a general coul^t martialfor his  trial is to be convened by the authority having the powerto  convene general courts  martial  under the Air  Eorce Act, andthe findings and  sentences of such  a general court martial can
be  confirmed by  any  officer- authorised-, to.... convene  the  court martial.  It is now  proposed that in these cases the general court martial shall he  convened by the  army authority as. in the caseof the army  officer, but that  confirmation shall in  general  be given  by the air-force authorities.   This clause enables theseproposals  to  be carried out.    The  clause  also  makes  provision to  meet the followingpoint:    At present forfeiture of seniority of rank can only he awardedin the army or  in a corps  as defined  by the Army Act.  In thecase of naval or air force officers who are subject  to military law,it is considered desirable that the Court should be  in a position to award  forfeiture  of  seniority of rank in  the  navy or air  force,as the case may be.  In the absence of such power there is inmany  cases no  intermediate punishment between  a  reprimandand  dismissal from  His Majesty&apos;s Service.   Although such  a sentence is passed by  a Military Court it will need confirmation by the Admiralty, or an Air Porce officer, as  the case may he.                           Clause 19.    This  clause  is  intended  to make  it  quite  clear  that  theexpression &quot; officer &quot; throughout the  Army Act includes, officersof the  air force who  are  attached to or  seconded  for service with the  military forces.
