I circulate for the  information of myColleagues the  following  memorandum by amember of my Staff.                    (Signed)   A. C. GEDDES.                    921,3.19.
       I  have  to report  that  yesterday I visited  the Brighton end  hove  and the  Lewes  Employment  Exchanges  In company  with  Mr. Glllott,  the  Manager,   Mr.  Gillott, an ex-Railway  Official, who was transferred in 1916 from the head  of  the Leeds  Exchange to  the  control of  the Brighton arid Hove Office, is  a Yorkshireman and struck me very favourably  as  being  a hard headed  man with  very  consider- able  powers of energy.       He has  nine  Sub-Offices  under him covering G50 square miles,  viz*-            Brichton and Hove  (Head Office)            Newhaven            Lewes            Uckfield            Haywards Heath            Burgess Hill            Cowfold            Shoreham            Seaford.       In addition  he carries out the  following -activities without  any Deputy of any  kind to  assist him, which struck me,  considering his responsibilities,  as  being too onerous  for one  man:-   Controlled  of sundry Juvenile Offices.   Secretary of  the Port labour Committee,  Kewhaven   Local  Advisory  Commiittee  consisting of 36  members       (a very active body)  with 4  or 5 sub-committees,       at whose  meetings he  is present..   Secretary -of  the Technical Advisory Committee for       Tailoring for disabled soldiers and  sailors.   Secretary of  the Advisory Committee for  Dental       Mechanics .   Member of six War Pensions Committees.   Member of War Agricultural Committee for V/est       Sussex.       He  Informed  me that  wherever a  job Tfas  offered to aman or woman  and refused,  the Unemployment  Benefit was suspended straight away, and the ultimate decision for granting  it remained with  the Court of Referees.   This applied  equally  in the case  of those  drawing  benefit during their first 13 weeks  or in the subsequent period. On my  putting  the  direct question to him, he  informed me that he and his  officials  Trere giving considerable legislation- tude to  demobilised soldiers and sailors, and in respect of disabled  men,  a very active and successful interest was being taken  in their placings^  At the Head Office it appeared that 1,408 soldiers and 767 men were receiv- ing unemployment benefit as well as 1,237 women and 42demobilised v,&apos;.A.A.C1 s .    There were 200 applications forunemployment benefit for the second period,  vis., 120men and 80  women,  out of which 50 cases had been estab-lished as straightforward  and genuine.   Out  of 30 casesdealt  with  by the  Local Advisory Committee at ones e s s 1 on: -         4  cases were allowed for 13 weeks         O   I!     II     II     II   A   II         4   11     &quot;  postponed.
425 disabled soldiers had. been placed in employment since junly 1918.   Mr. Gillott gave It as his  personal opinionthat the  extension of the time limit in.respect of Unem-ployment Benefit after the first 13 weeks was a deplorable-able waste of money and in his view it would only lead tothe pauperisation of the workpeople.   As regards thefirst period, of unemployment, he thought that 8 weeksshould have been sufficient.   He stated that his exper-fence had been that about 25% of the demobilised soldierspreferred to take up to about 8 weeks full holiday, butthat in very many  cases although the returned soldiersboth married and single were vei^y  desirous to take a pro-longed holiday, their employers dissuaded them by every means in their power from doing so.      He stated too that the educational Authorities wereaverse to the  granting of any more Juvenile UnemploymentDonations.   I myself interviewed some of the demobilisedsoldiers, all of whom seemed anxious to get back to adecently paid job.    It appears that they give no troubleat all, but that the Exchange is having a great deal of difficulty in placing the demobilised sol/iier of casualoccupation.   Most of these men appear to have come fromLabour Battalions where they have been doing odd jobs ofa very casual kind and not very strenuous at that.     In the case of the civilians receiving Unemploymentdonations, it appeared that most of these men had been paid off from the Mewhaven Docks where they have been engaged during the War in transhipping munitions,etc.   I myself saw many of these men and the great hulk of theunemployed at Lewes and Brighton and Hove were the workersdischarged from this port.   I was confirmed in my opinionthat this was the type of man who would be employed byLocal Authorities in road repair, roadmaking,etc., but unfortunately not a stone so far has been turned by any ofthe Local Authorities.     As regards agricultural labour, I elicited at Lewessome interesting information.   First of  all, the German -prisoners are still on the land.   As a result, the farm-ers are not prepared to pay casual farm labourers theminimum wage, but are naturally anxious to retain theGerman prisoners for whose labour they do not have topay on wet days.   On the other hand, they take ug? alarge amount of time at the Employment Exchanges by coming in to try and find out when their sons, who, of course,cost them little or nothing, ar - likely to be demobilised.I  was forcibly struck by the fact that the taxpayer wouldbe considerably relieved by the earliest possible dis-appearance of the German prisoners in spite of protests from the War Agricultural Committees, and I hope that everything possible will be done to expedite action bythe War Office in this sense.   The farmer&apos;s sons will, ofcourse, be retained in the Army of Occupation as a verylarge number only joined up in Kay, June,  July 1918.     I visited the Chaoriiian and the Surveyor of the EastSussex County Council, but, as they  were both unfortunata-ly away, I could only secure a brief interview with theChief Clerk who informed me that he saw no possibilityof work being started on roads until the end of Kay.On the other hand, I heard on all sides that there w ;san unfortunate hold up in the sanction for the making ofa now road from Lewes to Newhaven due apparently to differences of opinion between the tfar Office, the RoadBoard, and the Treasury.   I v,-as told that if this work
was put in hand it would give continuous- employment to200 men for two years.    In respect of the ordinaryCounty roads, the Chief Clerk explained that the new council only met on the 18th instant and that they wouldthen have to pass their budget,  that their scheme of roadrepair etc. would then have to be passed by  the LocalGovernment Board, that  five-eighths of -their steam rollershad been commandeered by the Government and not returned,and that the absence of coastal shipping and the conges-tion on the railways made it exceedingly difficult to getraw material.     I returned with a  very strong impression that nothingwill be rapidly done by these slow moving South CountryLocal Authorities unless     (a)  All the Departments with which they deal in          London appreciate the  economic waste that is          going on in Unemployment Donation and the          personal responsibility of each Individual          in a Government Office for seeing that every          possible measure, however indirect, is taken,          and every possible decision given, which will          have the effect of arresting the present          expenditure by getting as many as possible of          the unemployed on to some form of work.   For          instance, every day&apos;s  delay in the Admiralty          holding up unnecessary shipping, or any lack          of energy on the part  of the Military Author-          ities in Prance in not returning the steam          rollers, has  its direct influence on the          eoonomic s 11uation at home .    I  sm perfectly          certain that  the sooner this aspect of the          whole economic situation is  brought home to          those who hold executive positions, the          better it will be for the welfare of the          country.     (b)  I may be treading on delicate ground, but I          cannot help thinking that some galvanic          action is required on the part of those          Government Officials who deal with Local          Authorities.    I am not sufficiently informed          to know what their powory are, but if it is          true  *s is alleged, that they are adopting          an attitude of benevolent neutrality, then          I think the sooner the scope of their- duties          is enlarged the better it will be for the          taxpayer.     As regards housing, there seems to be nothing doing.On tho other hand, it was reported to me that all thelocal builders were anxious to get to work, but the unfortunate price of raw materials and the Incidence ofthe excess profits tax militated against tluir taking any immediate steps to get a move on.     Mr. Gillott informed me that a great deal of goodwould be done if the Railways also movud more, rapidly in respect of betterment.   He pointed out to me thathis railway experience showed him only too plainlythat tho permanent ??ay  ms in u ch?oadful condition.   He
                     -4*&quot; said  from what he  had heard  things were moving much faster up  in the North,    Of course,  it  is  only fair to remember that  the  Sussex people are somewhat  conservative In tempera- ment,  hut again, viewing matters  from a national stand- point,  it does strike me, without any first hand knowledge that  it is just possible that  the Railviay Executive Committee are taking up too  cautious a line In this direc- tion  and  have not  fully grasped the  urgent need for getting men on to some usefuj. work.      There is one  trouble in Sussex  for which I see no remedy at present,  and that  is the superabundance of women labour.    Mr. Gillott gav/e it  to  me  as his opinion that with  the  presence  of three potential ports, viz: Newhaven, Shoreham  and Portslada, he could  see no reason why more industries should  not have been started on the South Coast.    Priam conversations  he had with old fashioned Local  Authorities  some time  ago he gathered that their presence  would not be appreciTted, but he said certain developments were  taking place and that he was advising all his friends in the;  more congested parts of Yorkshire to come  South If they possibly  could to places where there was a  superabundance of labour.   He stated that now the War is  over the Sussex people are not inclined to move out of  their  county.      Mr.  Gillott $aye me as  his considered opinion that the effect of Army Order 55  was very detrimental to one man business cases  and he advocated very strongly that at the earliest possible moment strenuous efforts should be made  to release all  these men retained In the Service who had attained the age of 30.   He pointed out that their wholesale  retention meant a  great loss of employment.      While at Ley/es  I endeavoured to find out if any of the local  brickworks had been ro-started.   As I expected I found no signs that they wsre commencing and was met with all  sorts of  excuses,  i,e.,  lack of foremen,  lack of fuel,  bad month to start,  not paying proposition,etc. Here  again it seems  that no useful result will b-j attain- ad without some stimulation  from the central Government authority,     Since dictating tho above I have met a brickfield owner who informed me that he .ms ready to begin &quot;fork but was unable to do so until he had a sufficient reserve of coal.   I  do not know if the Coal Controller is  giving any special consideration to tha plight of brick works.      I should like  to mention that on my way back I visit- cd Messrs. Oppenheimer1s Diamond Cutting Works where I found 567  disabled soldiers at work cutting and polishing diamonds  in tho most modern and uj?-to-date factory I have yet seen.    The men working thare are of all kinds of pro- war occupations and come from all over the country -miners, ploughmen,  domestic servants,etc., some of them having 100/? disablement.   It was  extremely interesting, and one could not help being gratified to see that the extnnsion  to hold another 1000 employees  was  rapidly n*jar- ing completion.    The Manager informed me that some menwere making nearly  5 a week, and that recruits  for the
es.tablia-hrr.9nt were drawn from all over England and obtained through the agency of the WAT Pensions Committee.   he informed me that the men had given him no trouble.   Whathowever struck me most was the amenities of the factory,with its lighting, heating, ventilation, electrically pro-pelled machinery, and its special adaptation for disabledmen.     Further small factories are, I understand, being established at Fort William and Wrexham.11,5,1919.
