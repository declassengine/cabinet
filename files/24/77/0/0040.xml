jjglg  gOOSiSiS 13  ^HB,,PROP;S3!Y 0   .11:; BRIT.JHI0  LIATOTVS uOV^lraTUT j     The provision of adequate accommodation  for theDepartment of Overseas Trade in contiguity with the ForeignOffice and in the immediate neighbourhood of  the Board  ofTrade has become a moat pressing question?     The Cabinet have twice decided in principle during  thowar that such, provision should be mades but no steps havebeen tajzen to carry out their decision,,  - Meanwhile, with  tho-.cessation of war restrictions, c jmsnds made on the Department.are growing, and for February aro more than ,twice as great asin the corresponding month of last year.  Until suitable accommodation is found the efficiency of tho  work suffers:^nd through the present pressure and congestion tho health ofthe staff is pro,judiced0    ?or o-tara lo, the  Comptroller-Goiieral the acting Oomptrollor-Ooneral and two successiveprivate secretaries to the Parliamentary Under Secretary have all oroken down and have received loavo of absence forseveral months..     Sir Auckland GeddesT Committee on Trade  has also decidedthat fffom the point of view of trade such now accommodation is necessary.     The only satisfactory ultimate solution  is that theDepartment should bo housed in premises in contiguity withthe foreign Office and close to the -board of  Trade.   forthe time Doing, however, tho Department could probably  be housed in some building such as tho  War Trade IntelligenceDepartment which is being wound up*     I therefore ask the Cabinet to decide that adequatepremises in &quot;/westminster bo found for the Department, andbe ready for them to move into not later tnan April 15th.W A R   C A BINS TpAOOOIviMODATXOK IFOS DJPABTMSJIT Cf 0VJ5RSM3 TRADEJlote by Lord Ourz^n9(Iniitiallod)   C. of K26th March, iyi9*-3 33 .0  R B  !P*
