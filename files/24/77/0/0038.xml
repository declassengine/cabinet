&apos;THIf         111K -in        CIRCULATED TO THE KING- AMD WAR CABINET.     A NOTE OF WARNING ABOUT  THE MIDDLE EAST. by                   LOH) QUITO;.     I wish to express to my  Colleagues certain appre-apprehensions which I cannot help  entertaining about theprogress oX events in the Near  and  Middle East.   Theymay turn out to be quite unfounded;  but I  think thatwe should be on our guard against certain eventualitieswhich, if they occur, will probably come as a great-shock to all those in this and  other countries who are preparing for the conclusion  and celebration of a speedyand glorious peace.     I. say nothing here about the prospect  of Germanysigning the sort of Peace Treaty which it appears will shortly be presented to her.    It would, however, be un-wise, in ray opinion, to count implicitly upon her ac-ceptancen   The weakness of her Government, her menacingattitude on the Eastern frontier  of Germany and in  :Poland, the growth 01 dissensions among the Allies  inParis, may all tempt her to risk  refusal.     While however every one is discussing the probableor possible attitude of Germany,  no one appears to  turna thought to what may happen in Turkey.   Ever  since the                                          conclusion
conclusion of the Armistice.,  it appears to  have beentaken for granted that Turkey,  with our Fleet  at Con-stantinople,  could be compelled to accept whatever terraswe may dictate to her.   I pleaded more than once atthe time,, but without success.,  that the terms  of theArmistice with Turkey should be made much more compre-hensive and severe-.   * They-were not made so;   and ourposition at Constantinople has  since rested more uponthe calculating self-interest of the Turks  on  the onehand, and bluff on our part on the other, than it has done upon any confession of  lefeat on the part of theenemy, art convincing display of power by ourselves *     The city of Constantinople is in a state  of veryimperfect order:, though disarmament is being slowlypursued.   A Government is in power that alternatelyturns.to the French and ourselves., and endeavours  toflatter both into support of. Turkish claims in the  nearfuture.   Meanwhile the C.y.P. so far from being dis-solved, is everywhere active in the background.    It isstill the dominant force  in  the greater part of theTurkish Empire,   Enver is still a national hero.    Theforts of the Dardanelles  have never been destroyedt only                                          -  occupied
occupied by weak Allied detachment8-.   Allied forces arescarcely visible in Constantinople.     Wow let us see what is happening in that worldWhich is the political environment  of the Turkish  cap:.-tal.   Everywhere are manifest symptoms  of Allied  weal:-ness or disunion.   The Bolsheviks  have  just turned  theFrench and Greeks out of the &quot;Ukraine, and very  nearlyturned them out of Odessa,   General  Denikin, to whom we have widely advertised our assistance, is not   oingparticularly well on the Don and in th&amp; Caucasus *    Itis known that we are going to clear out of the  Caucasusas soon as we can, leaving, I can assure my -colleagues,a legacy of certain chaos and bloodshed behind  us.  Vieare already retiring from Transcaspia.   Cur flag  willpresently cease to fly on the Caspian.     If they look to another part of the horizon,  theTurks cannot fall to see with a chuckle of deep satisfac-tion that there Is a serious and widespread revoltagainst the British in Egypt, and that the Turkish flaghas actually fyeen raised again in the Valley of theNile.   The fate of Palestine is not yet decided.   TheFrench and British are squabbling over the future :1Syria.   Indeed  the entire  fate of those regions,  which
an attempt ought to have, been made  to  settle in theearly days of the Conference, is once  more  to be post-poned until a Commission has-been sent out  to examine and report.   I need hardly point out  what  magnificentopportunities for intriguehis will present.   Mean-while the Turks know well that an active controversyis going on as to whether the Greeks and Italians areto be allowed into Asia Minor., and if  so to what extant,and in what capacity,     The abov;. is the picture upon which the Old Turk,who still hopes to re-establish the former  regime, andthe Young Turk, who means to cheat us  if he can of thespoils of victory, look out from the crumbling watch-towers of Stambul*   Both are probably aware that  theycannot escape the loss of. Mesopotamia, of Arabia andthe Holy Places (although I am far from thinking thatthe new Arab State has any guarantees  for stable exist-ence), of Palestine, and in Europe of  Eastern Thrace,But when they realise that they are to be deprived al-together of Armenia, that they are to  be turned out  ofConstantinople and of Europe, and that even their  re-duced patrimony in Asia Minor and Anatolia is  either to
be parcelled out between enemies (Greece&apos;and-Italy)whom they abhor, or is to be patronised  by some foreignmandatory Power who will equally be  anathema to them, Isometimes ask myself - what will they do?   Will theyonce more bow to Kismet?   Or will they  think  it worthwhile to strike another blow (even if it be a  local andabortive blow) for Islam and the few remaining vestigesof their freedom?     I suggest to the military and naval authorities that they should not ignore these possibilities;  and Ipoint out to my colleagues, not as a prophecy  but as awarding, that fresh trouble may even now be brewing inthe East, which may disarrange some  of our best-laidplans.     PoB.   Since writing the above  I have seen anAdmiralty telegram dated March 22nd* from Admiral Cal-thorpe at Constantinople, which supplies a very signi-fleant confirmation of my argument.    He strongly de-precates any reduction of British Naval strength in  theEasterra Mediterraneant or the Black Sea, on the verygrounds which  I have urged, viz:  (1)  the failure  ofthe French  in  the Ukraine and the Crimea;   (2) thesituation in the Caucasus;   (3) the position at Smyrna;(4)  the unrest  in Egypt.   All these events cause  himto fear that he may he unable to cope with any seriouscrisis that may arise.                (Initialled)   C. of K.March 25th. 1919c
