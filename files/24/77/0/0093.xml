cjjl(circulated by the Home Secretary).                     FORTNIGHTLY REPORT ON--^p//9S^revolutionary ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED  KINGDOM                      AND MORALE ABROAD.     A comparatively peaceful fortnight is again tc be recorded.   The settlement with the &quot;Triple  Alliance&quot;, and particularly with the Coal Miners, has givengeneral satisfaction.    The prevailing East wind has been unfavourable torevolutionary propagandists, for bitter winds are not conducive to outdoororatory or large  audiences.     The extremists are  disgusted with Mr. Smillie and Mr, Thomas for accepting the Government terms when, with a little firmness, they might have produced theardently desired  revolution:  the orderly majority say that they wish they had such leaders, but even some  of the revolutionary men seem satisfied, and  say,&quot;Well, we can hardly  expeot  a big1 reduction in hours before we know how it is.going %t work out&quot;.    Correspondents in Coventry and Birmingham  both say thatthe revolutionary spirit is  largely  appeased, though from Birmingham comes thecurious complaint that the workmen&apos;s train services have not been altered tomeet the shorter  hours of work and they are kept waiting about on platforms fortrains.     The sectional coal strikes that were declared after the settlement werelocal efforts at  achieving a six hours&apos; day,  engineered by the extremists, whofelt that the Government, having yielded so far, would concede every  demand if itmB pressed home.     It is easy to attach undue importance to chanoo remarks in a orowd.   Forexample, a big oar draws up outside  an hotel  or a theatre, and a voice  says, &apos;^ait u^til the revolution comes:  they will  have to walk and we shall  ride&quot;.But my  correspondent says that  these remarks  are  often made in jestj  theappearance of the car inspires  a mild envy, for which the comment is  a  safetyvalve.     The storm centre at the moment  is south  Wales, where there iB a definitecrusade on the part of tho extremists of the  Independent  Labour Party amongyoung men and boys, urging them to reject  the Sankey Award and every concession granted by the Government.   A great deal  of  harm is  being done by William H,Mainwaring:,  of Clydach Vale, an open revolutionary, who has been fostering discontent     among the miners for the. past  four years.   The reoent strikeswere  engineered by what  is called the &quot;Unofficial Reform  Committee&quot; of the South -tales Miners&apos; Federation, all of whioh are extremists.    William Paul, from Glasgow, has  also been active,  but the  agitation is subterranean rather than open and,  therefore,  there is no evidence cn which a  prosecution can be founded, These  little V/elsh valleys are so isolated that  no  healthy breath of public opinion ever  seoms to reach them.    My  correspondents say that propaganda by speeches  does little good, for the agitators  fasten on weak points in the speechHi^Spr!^                     7th APr11&apos; 1919
   and us9 these as texts for their own addresses;  what is really wanted is a   number of working men propagandists who oould be trusted to expose fallacies in   public houses and at pit-head meetings.        It is significant that eight members of the T.L.F. were&apos;elected at the &quot;&quot;&apos; local municipal elections.   One cf ny correspondents says that he believes   that the judicious prosecution of some of the extremists-would have&apos; a very good   effeot.   Some months&apos;ago a &quot;few prosecutions-stopped all revolutionary   propaganda for weekri,                                t      , ,          -        Glasgow is quieter than it has been for many&apos; months;  ,the only disturbing   factors thore are the Sinn Fein Irish, who have opened a branch of the Irish   Volunteers for instruction in drill with a view to assisting Ireland in the   event of another rising,  , Several ex-soldiers were noticed among them.   The   general feeling is that  l.e miners&apos; ballot&apos;will result in a vote in favour, of  , aocepting the Government- offer.   A working man says that &quot;a feeling of  ...   .   ,   settling dov.rn is permeating the people;  everyone seems to be getting a bit  .   cheerier and brighter lacking, and far more contented;   there is not the Bame   grumbling&quot;.   Tho demand for a forty-four hours&apos; week seems-to have subsided,UNEMPLOYMENT.   y    The large number of: unemployed in-Lancashire,  Coventry,  and other centres   appear to be cheerful;   they are looking forward to being taken on with the   expansion cf work that may be expected after Peace  is signed.        An American, who has lately worked out tho figures on the basis of working   men killed or disabled, in the War and the present, increased size of the   permanent Army, says that there will be 200,000 less able-bodied men in the   labour market in Great Britain, as compared with the pre-War year and,  ther.a p.rsV!   that as soon as industries are in their normal working order.there should be   very little unemployment,THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTYv     &apos;.&apos;         ...  * \ /        This Party is reported to be gaining ground in Lancashire and. in Coventry,   It is pointed out that  the officialo of the&apos;Amalgamated Sooiety of Engineers,   with their  exclusiveness and refusal to work with&apos;other Unions,  are largely .   responsible fcr their unofficial  element being, ready to join hands with the   extremists  in.other Societies to  enforce demands.                          . - .        The extremists are&apos;&quot;&quot;making&apos; the  most of the unemployment;   they say that the   &quot;Promised Land&quot;  of the  *rime  Minister is &quot;A promised land  right  enough - more   promised now  than ever&quot;,    They taunt the workers with  having returned &quot;Mr..   Lloyd George&apos;1 s  crowd&quot; to Parliament.    They also work upon the fact that Irish   Sinn Feiners  were released before the expiration of  their  sentences^ while such   men as  Ramsey and Watson will have  to serve  their full  time.    &quot;Why&quot;,  they say.   &quot;are Irishmen to be treated  better  than Englishmen?   And if  favouritism is to   bo shown, why are  the Irish  the only favourites?&quot;    They are  trying to work up  a   demand  for  the  release  of Ramsay  and Watson,  but the workers  in ftancashire,   where the agitation is  strongest, seem disinclined  to take any industrial   action  on their  behalf,       -            -
        My correspondent, in Leeds, who gives summaries of recent Independent   Labour Party speeches,  says that in no case has the speaker raised any   enthusiasms,  certainly not in favour of revolution on the Russian plan,  for   upon Russia and the Bolsheviks the working men appear to have made up their   minds.   He also remarks upon the absence.of any serious criticism of the   Government whioh, he says, is credited with wishing to do its best for the   whole community.         t        The extremists, while talking very big in private, appear to be nervouB   as to what they say in public.   It is an honour, they say, to go to prison   for the &quot;Cause&quot;;,  Government oppression cannot deter them; . for every   prisoner two revolutionaries spring up;  persecution failed to stamp out   Christianity or Trade Unionism;  yet, for all this, imprisonment is  ,disorganising to the movement and unpleasant to the martyr.  *        The City of London branch is making a serio-comic appeal for funds.   The Honorary Treasurer writes, &quot;There is no objection to paying in advance  -   in fact, I prefer it.   The responsibility of avoiding super-tax on our   income won&apos;t turn my hair grey&quot;,        A project to fuse the Independent Labour Party, the British Socialist   Party, and the Sooialist Labour Party is on foot, but the members have not   yet been consulted.   The Socialist Labour Party has definitely withdrawn,   and  opinion in the Independent Labour Party seems to be divided,   Mr.   Snowden favours the combination, but Mr. Ramsey Maodonald thinks that it   would be detrimental to their activities in the House of Commons,THE HO-COMSCRIPTION FELLOWSHIP.        This Society appears to bo bankrupt,   Mr. Edward Grubb, the Hon.   Treasurer writeB that all the funds have gone in trying to obtain the release   of Conscientious Objectors, and that it is impossible to carry on the work   unless funds are largely increased,&apos;LOYALTY TO THE THRONE.        There appears to be a very string desire in Sheffield that the city.may   have an opportunity of seeing Their Majesties-.   There is a great deal of   jealousy between Sheffield and Leeds and the people of Sheffield always have   a:tendency to regard themselves as neglected when marks of favour have boert   conferred on the rival city.        My correspondent speaks of the very great popularity of the Prince of   Wales, especially among soldiers.   It is unnecessary, he says, for the press   to write about the Prince&apos;s behaviour during the war, every soldier knows it   and is ready to expatiate upon it,   lorkshiremen are sportsmen, and the   Prince&apos;s visit to the National Spirting Club the other night made a great   impression in Yorkshire,MAY DAY CELEBRATIONS.        In anarchist circles there is great hope t at thousands of police and   soldiers will take part in the May Day prooessions.  i
MISS SYLVIA PANKHURST.        This woman has repeatedly made use of language in her speeches on   whioh she night have been prosecuted.   Speaking at the Labour Club at   Rugby last week she said, &quot;There is a great move towards Soviets here; in   Belfast they came very near to establishing a Soviet in the last Strike,,,,   It is very hopeful that the soldiers and sailors are beginning to feel :  the spirit of revolt, because if we get the soldiers, sailors and   policemen with us we shall be able to take control of the country very  ^quicKly and without any bloodshed&quot;.   Her influenoe is small and she would   probably welcome prosecution;  it is oonsidered better for the present to   leave her alone,                 *                                            &apos;JOHN MCLEAN..                                   -   &apos;        On the 30th Martin this man spoke at the Amalgamated Society of   Engineers&apos; Institute, Sheffield, urging the miners not to accept the   Sankey Report, but to take control of. the mines,   He said that Bolshevism   must come, but England was,backward and that delegates were being sent from   Scotland to bring England into line, ! &apos;THE DAILY HERALD,        The first few numbers are well edited and contain nothing beyond what   might be held to be legitimate criticism.   The conductors are, however,   not at all easy about their financial position and are issuing a confidon-   tial circular to socialists, urging then to &apos;buy the paper.   Members of the   Independent Labour Party are known to be buying copies for distribution&apos;   among their friendB.   Meanwhile, the &quot;British Citizen&quot; of March 27th   contains an&quot;&apos;attack upon Mr, Lansbury, suggesting that the,sources of^is   funds are not above suspicion,          &apos; &apos;THE SAILORS *, SOLDIERS&apos; AND AIRMEN&apos;S UNION.        This Union has now established itself at the Offioe of the &quot;Daily   Herald&quot;- 2, Gough Square, Fleet Street, and the new Secretary is J.C.   Byrnes,   It is now, therefore, a definite branch of the Herald League,   and will probably be made a cover for&quot;the League in tampering with the   loyalty of sailors and soldiers,   It*s proceedings are being closely   watched.      &quot;PROSECUTIONS. -        On March-27th William Robert Scott, of 5 Smith Place, North Shields,   was convicted for distributing the pamphlet, &quot;The,Dictatorship of the .   Proletariat&quot;, among workmen;  he was sentenced to. six months imprisonment.        On March 24th six Lithuanians were convicted at Govan and sentenced   to fourteen days and recommended for deportation for causing a disturbance   at a public meeting on &quot;The. Bolshevik Rule in Russia&quot;.   About 400   revolutionary Lithuanians wore present at the- meeting.   The deportation   of these men will have a good effect.WORKIHGTUH - Cumberland.        A correspondent who is among the iron ere  workers at Workington
                                       M  5 **   reports that a very advanced paper  is  being  quietly circulated, called the   &quot;Mineworker&quot;, of whioh he hopes to  obtain  a  copy.   There io an advanced   Bolshevik &quot;School cf Economics&quot;, where the teaching is  said to be so   inflammatory that an extreme socialist described it as  &quot;too hot even for.   him&quot;.   There is very little unemployment  at Workington,THE HAlJpMAfr SOCIALIST,PARTY.        The National Socialist Party which includes Messrs, Hyndman, 0&apos;Grady,   Will Thome and Ben Tillott, is issuing leaflets against Bolshevism.   Other   Trade Unionists are sending out working-men  speakers  after a brief course of   training.   These efforts are believed to  be more valuable than any other   form of propaganda.                                BOLSHEVISM ABROAP.       Though definite information about the revolutions in Hungary and Bavaria  io still wanting, there seems reason for doubt as to whether tho new  Governments are really Bolshevik at all and are not bogeys set up for the  express purpose of frightening the Allies into oonoeding better terras.   The  Bolshevik creed knows no frontiers and no patriotism and yet Count Karolyi  resigned on a question of the national frontier,  and the new &quot;Bolshevik&quot;  Government assumod office on a question of pure patriotism.   The whole of  the drama and the press notices were too obviously &quot;staged&quot; to carry  conviction;  and the behaviour of the new proletariat Government appears  far  too virtuous to be real.       Bolshevism in Russia is running its course and, while there ia no  reason to doubt that the German Government is genuinely oonoerned at the  spread of Spartacisn, it is also still trying to spread the pCison in Allied  countries.   Sporadic outbreaks of tho disease are reported from various  British possessions, but it appears now to be dear that the disturbances in  Egypt were1purely nationalist and not Bolshevik in origin^   It is beginning  to seem likely that Bolshevism of the Russian type may pass like the  disease of Communism in Paris in 1871,VftANCE.         The acquittal of Villain,  the assassin of  Jaures, following the   condemnation of Cottin, who attempted the life of M. Clemenceau has been   most unfortunate at the present  juncture.   The  enemies of M. Clemenceau   and the extreme Socialists alike are furious at  what they call the insult   flung by a bourgeois jury at the proletariat.    A writer in &quot;L^umanite&quot;   says, &quot;Jaures has been killed a  seoond time&quot;.    Anatole  France writes,   &quot;This verdict puts you beyond the pale of the  law.    Workers.&apos; be on.your   guard&quot;.         The Police are dealing firmly with Bolshevik propagandists.  .  Three   Polish lumbermen have received heavy sentences for inciting troops at   Trcyes to desert, and at Lyons a Russian named V. GAMBAGHIS has been   arrested for conducting meetings in cafe;;.
        In the  5th Army Area there is unrest among the troops;  &quot;L^nternation-   ula&quot; has  been sung by Frenoh soldiers in publio and soldiers have been   heard  to  say that they were out for Revolution.   The long delays of the   Conference in Paris are producing a feeling of uneasiness ab:.,ut the future,   but unless the Confederation Generals du Travail declares for a general   strike (which ia considered very unlikely) no aotive disturbance appears to   be imminent.BELGIUM;.  &apos;        M. Huysman, at a meeting of the Socialists In Brussels on the 13th   March/ appealed to the working classes of Europe to combine in an   International Republic, in which strategical frontiers would have no place.   At the close of the mooting there were scenes of enthusiasm;  &quot;L&apos;Internaticn-   ala&quot; was  sung, and there were cries of, &quot;Vive la RuineJ Vive les Soviets!   Vive la Revolution!&quot;        There is depression all over Belgium, notioeably at Bruges, and, of   course, a great deal of unemployment, but the Authorities do not expect any   outbreaks.   They are quietly attempting to organise the Civic Guard on a   new pattern, whore convivialities and decorations (which were the chief   motive for enlistment in the old Civic Guard) are to have no place.        Anti-English feeling, probably fo3terod by tho French, appears  to be   growing,   The Socialist Society in Ghent (Visor fit ) io becoming a strong   oo-cperative body;  it Is selling bread cheaper than the ordinary baker,   and doing an enormous trade;  it owns a oineraa for propaganda purposec, and   is issuing leaflets as wrappers for its loaves of tread,-SWITZERLAND.        The  Swiss General Staff does not expect any serious troublo for six   months,   Reaction is consolidating, and the Swiss Bolshevik Party is very   short  of money.   When Platten&apos;s mission returns from Petrograd, tho Swiss   Government hopes to deport all unsatisfactory Russians, fsr personal   contact in the workshops has moro influence with tho Swiss working nan than   oratory.   Flatten&apos;s most active supporters are young Jews,        The  extremists appear to be splitting into two Parties, and this may   be tho undoing of the revolutionaries. &apos;  There have been rumours for some   time that a  general strike would break nut towards the ev-d of tho month at   Bale and  Zurich, where the Gorman communities were expected to join tho   rioters.   The Authorities were quite ready, but nothing took place,          Flatten attended the Soviet Congress at Moscow, and has not yet   returned,        A copy  of ^enin&apos;8 instructions to the Swiss Bolsheviks, which ure  .   described as &quot;Lenin*s twenty-eight commandments&quot;, is instructive reading   if it  is a genuine document.   No, 12 says that tt- obtain concessions from   the bourgeoisie, one must appropriate their property by force.        The  German frontier control is vory slack, and Bolshevik agents find   no difficulty in passing it with false passports made out in the vrrong
*m 7 m   names.        Bands of Bolsheviks of from fifty to one hundred are  roaming about  on   the other side of the Swiss frontier,  and it is  feared that  in  the  event of   a rising in Zurich they may cross and  aBBlst the rioters,,GERMANY.        According, to a message from Dantzig, the German People&apos;s Council  has sent   u telegram to the German Government,  saying that all Germans expect from them   the performances of a Talleyrand who  knows how to make capital  out  of  Wilson   and out of Bolshevism.   The ^erman Government seams scarcely to have  needed   this reminder.   It is genuinely alarmed about Bolshevism in Germany,  and is   fighting it, but it fails to recognise the dangers which would  assail   Germany if it spread&apos; in enemy countries.   A propaganda leaflet which  was   being circulated among the troops&apos;in  occupied territory contains internal   evidence that it was drafted by an American,   Other leaflets of the same kind   seem to have been drafted and printed by Russians.   They are rather feeble   productions.        Scheidemann, commenting ou events in Hungary, on the 24th  iwarch,  said   that the formation of a Bolshevik Government in Hungary was  the result of the   &quot;imperialism of the Entente&quot;.   &quot;The  Allies were-.playing with fire  when they   refused to sign Peace immediately&quot;*   All this seems to support the, view that   there is stage management in the presentation of Bolshevism  in.the  Central   Empires.        A German journalist whose sympathies are believed to be With France,   where he was long a press correspondent, is of opinion that  the ,great   pre-qecupation of the German Government is to oonvince Europe that  Germany   has renounced the spirit of the fortner regime.   He said that at a  recent   meeting of the National Assembly a tempest of applause greeted  the  speech of   Ndumahn, the author of &quot;^itteleuropa&quot;, in which he said that.Germany would   not be debarred from the expansion to which she is entitled, and that though   she wants ^eo-ee, her downfall has not reduced her to such a  state that she   will accept whatever burden is laid upon her.   He is of opinion that there   is a secret understanding between the Gerrian Government and  the Bolsheviks   and that Germany will set forth againoon her Imperialistic march as soon as   Peace has dissolved the Entente against her.        On the other hand, Spartacism lives upon the lack of work, poverty of   food, and the feeling that the present Government is Socialist  only in name.   Vengeance for&apos; Liobknecht and Luxembourg plays no part - in the  march of   events they are already almost forgotten.   If the Spartaoists  had&apos;any   leader they might be in power, but Eichhorn - the one man who might have   seized the reins - lost his opportunity by disappearing and  deserting his   followers, ,  The greatest menace to Scheidemam^s Government  is  thu  disaffection   of the troops.   How far the infection has spread among then is uncertain,  but   if the present strikes spread and become general, the Spartacists may succeed   in a coup d&apos;etat.       : A pamphlet apparently issued by one of the academic anti-Bolshevik   Societies proves to be a very wishyr.washy document, unlikoly,  one would think,
   to influence the working men of any country.AUSTRIA.        The Military Governor of Vienna is believed to have 4,600 Folice  and   about 15,000 Volkswehr to keep order,   The latter, in his opinion,  are   not to be oounted on, but the Police are loyal,  though t&apos; ey can hold   important points like the Arsenal only for about three days.   An outbreak   was expected early in April, but the Military Govornor thought that  a   single regiment of French, British, or American troops (not Halians)   would be sufficient to maintain order.        The Spartacist movement is growing in Silesia, and the numbers  are   now believed to be about 20,000 but for the moment Vienna appears to be   the danger spot.        The Socialists in Austria are reported to have replied to the   manifesto of the Hungarian Proletariat, greeting it with sympathy, but   deolaring that on account of the lack of food, German-Austria is at  the   moroy of the Allies, and cannot take part in a revolutionary movement.   This is a remarkable excuse.        An American informant states that the Government is seriously   considering whether it will hand its power over to a Soviet, as was  done   in Hungary.   &amp;e thinks that the only salvation would be a definite   statement from the Allies that they would oppose Bolshevism and that this   would strengthen the Government.        There is a railway strike, but it may not become general, in view of   tho necessity of bringing in food trains.BOHEMIA.        Food consignments are now coming into the country and producing an   excellent effect.   The chief activity of the Bolsheviks is in the mineral   districts.HUNGARY.        A Government proclamation states that only Socialism, tho creation  of   Communism, in capable of preserving the country fronjthe anarchy of   disruption;  that as the Paris Conference had decided on the Military   occupation of Hungarian territory, the revolution had only one means of   salvation, namely, &quot;the Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot;,   This motive   for &quot;going red&quot; is quite inconsistent with the Russian form of Bolshevism,   which recognises no frontiers and no patriotism.   Count ikarolyi, moreover,   is reported to be in close touch with the new Government.        At American informant who left Buda Pesth on March 22nd, reports  that   the death penalty is executed upon looters, and a fine of 5C,000 kronen   imposed on the sale of alcohol, and 10,000 kronen on the person oonsuming   it.   There soems to be a disposition to be friendly to English and   Americans, though not to the French.   cela Kun, the Foreign Secretary,   a Lieutenant in the Reserve j is a ^ew, as are Pogany, Commissary for War,
   a non-0ommissioned Officer in tho Army,  and Bonn,  Commissary  for Industry.        There are persistent rumours in Vienna of a counter-revolution In   Hungary, and of tho death of Bela Kun.BOSNIA.        Early in March revolutionary movements broke  out in Bosnia, Slavonia   and Croatia, and villages were over-run by bands of armed peasants firing   on the Serbian troops.   The Authorities are reported to be powerless.ITALY.         The Socialist Party in Italy is planning a great celebration for   the 7th April, the fiftieth anniversary of the Tusoan Revolution;  a   &quot;Red Week&quot; is promised.   For the first time since the War, the Socialist   and Revolutionary Parties are joining in a demonstration.  The Government   is taking the neoeGsary steps.        6,000 technical foreman in Turin are on strike.   Ooke has risen to   1,000 lire a ton and other necessities  are rising proportionately.   Tho   exchange has jumped to 745, and the economic condition is becoming serious.RUSSIA.        The Bolsheviks are not altogether  happy in the form of their propaganda,   if we may judge from specimens of leaflets intended for the Entente Foroec,   and from a leaflet printed in Hindustani and Intended for India, which   began with a denunciation ^f the system of Caste.    A special effort is new   being made in China by inundating the country with Bolshevik  literature, so   far, however, without much success.        Mr. Arthur Ransomo gives an interesting account of the Meeting of the   Third Internationale at Moscow.   The British representative  was no other   than Joe Fineberg, who acted as idtvinoff&apos;s Soorctary in London, a Russian   Jew who had acquired British nationality.   The Hall was hung with red   draperies, and the proceedings were conducted mostly in German,   Flatten   represented Switzerland.   Lunaoharsky is said to have avowed frankly that   the position of the Bolshevik Government has become intolerable, and that the   lack cf bread, fuel, and raw materials  had provoked wrath against the   &quot;inefficiency of the Government&quot;,   Ho  confessed that if the  economic   blockade continuedx&apos; the Bolshevik regime must come to an end, and that the   Bolsheviks had not been able to reulise their ideals,        Tchitcherine, interviewed by the &quot;Social Demokraten&quot; on  the report that   the Bolsheviks were giving concessions  to foreign capitalists, said that   there could be no question of granting concessions to nationalities who wexs   fighting the Bolsheviks, but hinted that concessions might be given for the   construction of railways and the getting of minerals.        Maksondoff, President of tho Council cf  Mohararaedane  in  Russia, states   that there are over 16,000,000 Mohammedans in Russian Siberia, they are not   Bolsheviks, and they consider Bolshevism a menace  to the world,   The   Bolshevik, oreod is quite incompatible with Mohammedan  teaching,
        details have been received about the  Russian Red Cross,    All its   genuine Red Cross activities have long oeased,  and its reputable  personnel   have left it.   its avowed function is now the  relief and ;the interests  of   Russian prisoners abroad,  and for this purpose  the agents carry considerable   sums of money, but the money is really devoted  to Bolshevik propaganda.   .;,  -  The .two&apos;Americans who have returned from Russia with reports for the   ^eaoe&apos; Conference are distrusted by their compatriots as being incapable  of -  Representing the true facts of any situation.   One of them was a member of   $he Ford Peace Rarty, and  before leaving for Russia he acted as a &quot;bottle   neck&quot; for information destined for the higher offioials of the Delegation,   a$d it was believed that such information did&quot;not reach them in its   original form.   Their reports, therefore. Should be received with caution,    i-:        it is reported from Copenhagen, through the Americans, that the   Bolshevik Government has stated officially that it has discovered a   conspiracy consisting of members of the Left Socialist Revolutionary  Party,   and has arrested, fifty of  its leaders at Moscow, among whom is Madame   Spiridonoya.  .. They have also discovered that it had fcranohes in the   provinces.        The Americans report  that 40,000 men are out of work in Odessa,  and   the tramways have stopped  running.   There is rapid growth cf Bolshevik   feeling among the labouring olass, and great dissatisfaction among all   classes.   The French troops are tired of fighting, and their morale  in   indifferent.   Trotsky&apos;s attempt to recruit the Red Army from prisoners  of   war returning from Germany, has failed;  they return to their homes at the   first opportunity.        The Czech Army is over-run with Bolshevik  propagandists;  it is   feared that if it is asked to guard railways it will obstruct traffic and   countenance local disorder.   The Czech soldiers blame the Allies for not   sending thorn home,     - -        In conversation with  Mr, Ranscme, Lenin said that he was counting upon ,  the&quot; Shop Steward movement  to bring about Revolution in England, and to the   objection that the Shop Stewards have no constructive policy, ^enin replied,   &quot;Persecution by the Government will compel them to formulate one&quot;,NORWAY,        From private letters  it appears that a general strike i3 in  -contemplation during this  month,   A pamphlet was recently distributed in   workshops In Christiania,  recommending sabotage, on the ground&apos;that maohine ,  power should be made to strike in ooncert with  manual power,  so that   &quot;blaoklegs&quot; might not be employed as strike-breakers,SWEDEN.        Tho most hopeful factor at.the moment is the split between the   Bolsheviks and the other extreme Socialists, v/hich will weaken&apos;the   position of the Party in the impending Communal elections.   The Executive   Committee of the Socialist Party has published  in tho &quot;Politiken&quot; a
   Resolution to be adopted at Mass Meetings, declaring &quot;tho  necessity for  an   immediate international rally round the ideas,  programme,  and tondonoies   represented by so-callod Bolshevism and Spartaoism&quot;.

A        The Americans report that Bolshevik agents are recruiting Russians   in Denmark to return to Russia, probably to serve in. the Red.Army,        Though the Bolsheviks have no offioial representative in Copenhagen,   they use  their Kod Cross representative,  .HOLLAND.        Though everyone is agrood that Holland swarms with Bolsheviks and that,   in&apos; the event  of Germany becoming Spartacist, there will be serious trouble,   the position at present is more  stable than it was.   Tho  police authorities   do not-think  that,-any  outbreak is imminent.   Though 25^ of the Dutch   population are either  Social Democrats or Bolsheviks, fortunately the two   parties do not agree,   Tho Bourgooisi have formed a Civil  Guard and quite   a  number  of working men belong to neither of tho revolutionary parties,   A  fortnightly anti-Bolshevik paper &quot;La Defense&quot; is&apos;  now being published in   Amsterdam, edited by Baron  Rene  de Schacken .     Among its objects is tho   organisation  of a special sorvioe of volunteers to  )co.;p observation on the   arrival and movements  of Bolshevik agents,   Tho Anti-Bolshovik League,   which supports this pap -r,  intends to nominate delegates to represent it in   England,  as well as in other countries.        Though tho Dutch  Police arc sorutinising immigrants very closely, in   order to  exclude alien Bolsheviks, their hands are  tied (as in the case in   this country)  when the Bolshevik agent is of Dutoh nationality.   Thus,   Madame Rutgers-Meos, who has lately come  from Moscow in possession of a   large sum of money for Bolshevik purposes, was able to enter the Country   unchallenged,   A member of the  2utch Government stated lately to the   Americans  that the Red Army hoped to ontor Germany  in April or May, and
                                 m    *-   that the Bolshevik group in Holland would then rise at Groningen.SPAIN.        Striker? and riots are fust subsiding, and the atmosphere is clearer.   The settlement at Barcelona was a victory for the  Syndicalists,PORTUGAL        It is reported that the Democratic Party contains officials who are   little better than Bolsheviks,   The Minister of the Interior is stated to   have said, &quot;Well, after all, Bolshevism, though not quite in the Russian   form, is the future doctrine of the world, and it is no use taking too   strong measures against it&quot;,        A new newspaper &quot;A Batalha&quot;, the organ of the Workers&apos; Union, is   openly Bolshevik, and nothing can be done to stop it,EGYPT.        Though serious disturbances are over, the position is very disquieting.   The Nationalist movement, at first purely politioal, is now taking a   religious turn.   Seditious speeches are made day and night in the Azhat   Mosque, a place of sanctity throughout the Moslem world, where fanatical   speeoh cannot well be interfered with,   The movement appears to be   reverberating through Palestine and S-Tia, and, if this is true, India can   scarcely escape a   Apparently there is no element of Bolshevism in the   movement, but the newspaper reports of Bolshevik activity cannot be   altogether without influence,        A report from Orete states-that the National Movement in Egypt is   being fostered by the Young Turks and that it is condemned by all Turkish   Liberals.SOUTH AFRICA.        The riots in Johannesburg have assumed a Bolshevik complexion though   they are primarily Syndicalist, and there is great unrest among native   labour.   The latest reports are to. the effect that though the strike is   settled, the revolutionary element will do its utmost to keep the unrest   alive, AUSTRALIA.        The behaviour of Russian Bolsheviks in Brisbane provoked a riot, in   whioh discharged soldiers took part.   It has created a very hostile   feeling towards the Russian Bolsheviks throughout Australia, and the   Government intends to deport the leaders,;   It is very desirable that the   deportees should not be sent to England, but should, if possible, be sent   straight to Odessa. am ZEALAND.        Hew Zeuland appears to be free from Bolshevism, Syndicalism, and the   doctrines of the Industrial Workers of the World.   A few pamphlets find   their way into New Zealand from Australia from time to time, but that is   all.  ..
B.H.T.CANADA.        Extracts from a book published  in Winnipeg describe the Bolshevik   polioy in the United States and Canada as being directed towards overthrowing   the &quot;damnable trinity of Religion, Government, and Capitalism&quot;.   The   Vancouver Trades and Labour Council  have voted by a large majority for the   formation of &quot;One Big Union&quot;;   this  was endorsed  by the Calgary Conference,   representing all the Unions in West  Canada.   The Conference sent   congratulations to the Bolsheviks in Russia  and the Spartaoists in Germany.   This roused the wrath of the War Veterans, who demand  the deportation of   the leaders for &quot;riot, fiedition and  disloyalty&quot;.           ^ARGENTINA.        The Americans report that Bolshevism has developed in the Argentine   and will spread&apos; to other countries on  the Continent.
