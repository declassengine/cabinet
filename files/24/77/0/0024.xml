MR BONAR LAW:  I am sorry, Mr Smillie,  that we have not been   able to get hold of Mr Justice 8ankey,   We were told he    would lunch at his Club.  He is not there, and it is    supposed ha las found he cannot get to his Club and has    gone to lunch somewhere else.  You were very anxious that    lie should be here, I  think.MR SMILLIE:  We were rather anxious that he should be here,    because we have talked matters over with him since he    reported to you, asking for definitions on certain oases.MR BONAR LAW:  I would be quite willing to wait, except that    I do not know what it means.  It means that we might have    to wait an hour or more.  What do you say?MR SMIELIE:  Some of the points  wo are going to put before    you I think he oan advise you onj that is the reason we    really wanted him to be present,MR BONAR LAW:  X am quite willing to wait if you do not mind.    Unfortunately there are no means of getting into- touch    with him.  He was to lunch at the Oxford and Cambridge    Club, but he has not gone there,  I think the explanation    is that  he started to go there, but, finding ha could  not    get to the Club, went to some restaurant,MR SMILLIE:  There is no  hope of him getting  here, I suppose?MR BONAR LAW:  Well, they know at his house.  If ha goes    either to his house or  the Club, he will get my message.,    If you approve of postponing this meeting until later  to-day    X would be quite willing- but just whatever suits you. I    am entirely in your lands in that respect,  I think it    would be a waste of your time and mine to sit here with    such complete uncertainty, but if you prefer to fix, say,    6 o*clock or something of that kind, that will suit me.MR SMILLIE:  Trat would be very inconvenient  to us.MR 8UTT0N:  Some of us lave given our hotels up.MR SMIL IE:  Supposing we put the points we wish to raise
    before you, then you can decide w better you  think it would    be wise to Bay anything about them.MR BONAR LAW:  Of course if you do not want an immediate an-    swer from me- which, perhaps, you could  not i&amp;ve in any    case--I will take a careful note of  your  points and con-    suit Mr Justice Sankey about them  as eocn as ha is avail-    able.MR SMILLIE:  I do net think we do expect an immediate answer    from you,ME BO MR LAW:  Very well, than we oan  go on.MR SMILLIE:  Well Mr Bo mar Law, I need not go into the whole    history of this-, because you know  about it as well as X    do myself.  If you look at tbe Report of  the Chairman,    Mr Artiur Balfour, Sir Art bur Buck tern, and Sir TiDmas    Hoyden, you will see that they put their  Recommendations    right in the front of it.  Th&amp;y first of  all propose that    the word &quot;seven&quot; should be inserted  in whit  is called the    light Iburs  Act in place of the word &quot;eight&quot; as from    July 16th, 1919.  We have recognised all  along ti&amp;t if    we were to have by law, or even by agreement, an altera-    tion from eight to six in the Eight  Hours Act, it would    take some time to prepare and to make all arrangements    in order ti&amp;t the output should he interfered with as    little as possible&apos;, so that we do  not object to July,    1919, being fixed.  Tint gives some  months in which ar-   rangements could be made. But following that  it says:-    &quot;Subject to the economic position  of the  industry at the    end of 19i*Q, by the substitution of  the word &apos;six&apos; for    the word 1 eight1 as and from July  13th, 1921*.  We want    to ask that the words &quot;Subject to  the economic position    of the industry at the end of 1920*  be taken out, and    than it would read:-&quot;As and from July 16th,  1919, by the    substitution of the word Uix1 for the word  Uight1&quot;,    and so on.  What it means is this, that we feel, while                           -4-
    we are willing  to waive tte point or wtotter  it should    be an immediate six or not, we are willing to accept tte    first step in July of this year, and tte second step to    be named in this Act to take place as from July, 1920,    which is one year, and that it should not be  subject to    tte economic position at tte time.MR BONAR LAW:   It is two years to 1921.MR SMILLIE:  We want to substitute 1920 for 1921  because-    Mr Justice Barkey will tell you what was in his mind when   te proposed this-- we ted in our minds and we  discussed it    at tte Commission, that if it were a double step there                                           first    should be six months elapse between tteA$xm step and tte    second step. We understand that te and some  otter gen-    tlemen on tte Commission were in favour of it being taken    in two steps instead of one, because there would be less    dislocation of  trade.  But we ted no idea that it would    be proposed that even twelve months should come between    tte steps.   All we ask now is that July 12th stould be    substituted for July 13th, because July 12th is a Monday;    that 1920  steuld be substituted for 1921,  and that tte   words &quot;Subject to the economic position of tte industry    at tte end of 1920&quot; steuld be deleted.  That  is our pos-    iticn.   I  want  to put it to you as briefly as I possibly    can,  in keeping with your being able just to  follow it    and understand  it.        Clause  2 with us is a most serious matter.  In all    our Resolutions passed at our Annual Conference, and    passed again since that time,  we claimed a reduction in    tte lours  of persons employed on the surface  about tte    collieries  to the same hours as ttese employedNWI fate *    ground.  You will notice,  in tte Report of what might be    called  one  side  of tte Commission,  ttey reported that in    tteir opinion tte case was made out for our claim to have    a Six Hour  Day for persons underground and persons                             *5-
employed about the eurfaoe  of  the rr.ir.ea.  Mr Justice San-key, and %m others who signed this Report with him,w is ted us to put in forty-six.  They reoo.me.Td &quot;that asfrom July 16th,  1919,  the tours of work of persons, employ-ed on the surface at or about  collieries eimll be forty-six and a ialf working tours per week,  exclusive of meal-times9.  As a matter of fact,  that is  not a reduction, itis practically no reduction in the tours of surface work-ere at all at the present time, because it takes only very little more than an tour  or an  tour and a half offthe working tours tint are  presently in force.  In manyof  the districts men at the present  time work almoststrictly an light Hours Day.  Ttose who are employedreally manipulating coal, pitching it  off the pit bank,emptying it, and everything of ti^t kind, only work thetime the pit is winding, so tot they  lave an Eight HoursBay; and perraps at the end of the shift wton the pitstops winding and the men begin to come up, they are there for a quarter of an tour or tolf an  tour in some oasesto redd up things, end then they are finished.  We ask that there stould be a reduction in  their  tours of labour,and we would like to ask you to substitute for forty-six and a half working tours forty-five  hours per week, in-oluslve of meal-times.  That is what we propose,                         -6-r
   3                                                              137   SIR ROBBRT H0HNJ5:   It is only a very short time ago that we had an        application from certain aurfn.ce workers?  to limit their hours        to 48.(   MR SMILLIB:  Yes,  to 48.   Our surface workers that we are espeakiing        for now had their hours limited to 49.   SIR ROBERT HQRK3S:   That does not agree very well with the suggestion        that you make.   m BONAR LAV?:  That this makes no difference.   MR SMILLIS:  As a  matter of fact we have nothing to do with the                                    one        application you had from any^uty else. *  SIR ROBERT HORTIE:   No, but&apos; they represent a very large body of sur-        face workers.    I fancy they are all working the &quot;same hours.   MR HKRB35RT SMITH:   But we represent 75 per cent more than them of        surface workers.   MR SMILLIB:  Yes.             f   SR^^I^ygsfesgS.te525$^point is not the question between the two        * &amp;&amp;f&amp;s&amp;&amp;*   It is a question of fact.   You said to me that        this represented hardly any improvement.   MR SMILLIK:  Ho.   MR BONAR LAW:  This other thing says that it represents an immense        improvement.   MR 8MILLIK:  We do not know.   This Commission was set up to deal        with out claims.   MR BOliAR LA&quot;&quot;:  But still, as evidence of fact that must be taken        into account,  surely.   MR 8MILLIE:  As a  matter of fact we secured;, by agreement some time        ago a 49 hours week.   MR B01IAR LAW:  This is 2  hours less.   O SMILLIE;  Yes,  this is 2% hours less.   MR SUTTOB:   In some instances there are surface hands who work less        than 49.   MR SMLLIE:  Some  work a strictly 8 hour day.   MR VERNOH HARTSHORN:  Inclusive of meal time j\   T.:R 8MILLIE:  Yes,  48 hours a week inclusive of mealtimes.  However,        we would like to put our position before you  on  the  matter  -
We a sic that it a JD old bo a 4b hours week ino&amp;urfc of moal times.   I think you will  find that that is more hours than too Jfiiners   Federation claimed.     Of course they claimed a 56 ho urweak for these people, whereas this is a 45 ho are week,  and   that means a reduction of 1 nour per day on the minersc  claim - 45 hours  per week.   There has been a 44 hours week   given in some industries, and there has been a 40 hours   week given in some surface industries.   So that I do not   think that is at  all an unreasonable claim for men working   on the surface of the mine.        How in regard &quot;to Clause 3,  .1 m%y say this ie a most   important clause.   We claimed an increase of 30 per cent   on earnings minus a 3/- per day war wage.    We claimed that   in percentages because of the fact that on the two previous   occasions on which wages were considered by the Coal Con-   troller we claimed a a increase in wages on a percentage   basis,  but the Coal Controller suggested to us that it   might be well to  make it a flat rate advance if any advance   was  given in order to help the lower paid workman.    That   occurred on two occasions.   We agreed to it quite freely,   because we were asking that i norcase of wages  because of the   increase in the cost of living,  and we quite agreed sfcxia&amp;when   he suggested that the lower-paid men had to meet the  i aoreas-   ed cost of living the same as the better paid  men.    We   secured l/6d on each of those occasions,  ami if  you will   consider it for a mm&amp;t you will see at ones that that   changes very  considerably tho pure outage as between the   high paid men and the low paid men.    The high paid men   got  3/- in the two advances,  and the low paid  men got 3/-   in the  two advances with a very  considerable change in per-   cengage.    So that when you go into  the percentage that   has  been received by the workers about the mine owing to   the  increased coat of living,  you will find the lower paid   man  has got a considerably nig liar percentage than the
higher paid man.  In this case we ask for a 30 per cent increase on the earnings of workers outside the war wage.          The Renort of the Miners&apos; Representatives on the coal commission found that that case was made out, and they gave rea-sons for it, but Sir John Sankey&apos;s Report offers 2/-. How thatwas arrived at we do not know;   and that 2/- for adults andl/- for workers under 16 years of age is for the days worked.                                                      *flow I want to put it to you that that is a very difficult thingfrom  the war wage given by the Coal Controller.    The  firstincrease of l/6d  and  the second increase of l/6d given by theCoal Controller were given for every day worked, and every days person presented himself for work but failed to get work orto find employment through no fault of his own.   The Coal Con-troller had in his mind and the Government I am sure had intheir minds that it required at that time 9/- a week as nearly as possible to meet the increase  in  the cost of living, andthat if a person only worksi5 three days because the pit was idlefrom some cause or another he still required hie 9/-;  so thatthat 9/- was paid whether a person really worked six days orfour days, provided he was not idle through his own fault. that/6d per day was paid where the custom was to work five days aweek;  where it was the custom to work five days l/6d was paid for six days.   ?/here the custom was to get six shifts for five,supposing that with the night men - a very large body of menin South Wales - war wage was paid on the six days in the week,if the men were on night turn they only^worked five days.  that war wage was paid if a breakdown to machinery or an inundationof water took place,and 100 or 1000 men were idle for a coupleof weeks, to men who did not go near the pit at all, as a kindof allowance for them to live upon.   I believe that Mr.&apos; Jus-tice Sankey and those who signed with him  had in their mindsthat phase of the thing, because they calculated in arriving                                         wageatbthis 2/- how much the l/6d or 3/- war/isax- had cost;  they
  calculated in millions now much it had  cost, and I believe  they baaed their ;V- en it.  I  have discussed it with Mr Just-  ice Sanksy, and you will discuss it with him,  I am sure.  I am sure you will find thatlathoy did calculate on what the  war wage coat. It is perfectly clear when you  take into  consideration that about five days a weak,or less  than five  days a week    I asean ** little over five days  is the average  that all grades of man work in the alnes.  It is considered  a very good average if they work 5i days on the average.  In some of the deep mines, coal getters employed especially  underground do vo ry well if they work four days a,week, owing  to the heat of the nuns. Clearly this &apos;?./- a day would  only a  apply to four days in every week; it would only apply  to five  days where they only work five days by  lord custom and  arrangement with the&apos; employers. We ask  that that 2/- should  he made 2/6, and we believe it would be possible to do  that  on the amount of money that Mr Justice  S&amp;nkey  had  in his  mtnd when  he calculated this out, he &amp;n&amp; his friends.  We do  not ask that 1/3 should he paid to persons under 16, but we  would content ourselves with l/- being  paid to persons under  16, which will amount probably to 20 per cent  or 25  per cent  of the persons.    We feel  that if that concession should be ma.de,  it would not  cost more  money from the industry than was in  the  mind of Mr  Justice Sankey. Of course, in discussing this  Report,  I only                                         \  discuss it because you have stated that you are prepared to  adopt it.  This is not the Report we would like to  discuss,m BOMB LAW: I quite understand that.&amp; 8W..LLIB: But I think we are beyond discussing  our  own  Report,  in view of the fact that you hive said  you would accept Mr  Justice Sankey&apos;s Report. That is  tiu reason why we are trying  to modify  this one.     With Secommsndation ifo.4 we are in entire agreement.  believe if we get over the present difficulty;, there is   useful work for that Commission to do in the  direction                      10.
s   of improving the standard of  life,  improving the development   of the mining industry in order  to  increase the output, and   if possible to lessen the cost of production. We believe   there is good work for that Commission if ic be agreed to   go on.       Sbw in the step from 8 hours to 7  mentioned in this   Recommendation,  we pointed out to  che  Commission,we pointed   out to the Coal Controller, or at least to Sir Robert Horne   and the Prime Minister when we were asking for/the hours of   labour, that we wanted 30 per cent  on  the present rate of   wages, and that the wages of  those  who have fixed wages should   be maintained with the reduced hours of labour,  and that   there would be a considerable reduction of output, taking   the two hours a day off all at once, until there was a re-   adjustment of haulage and every tiling to enable our people   perhaps to again improve their output. But we said that   the wages augmented by 30 per cent  would be necessary to   keep the families in the state we wished them kept in.        Then the day wage men&apos;s  wages,  either with one or two   hours leas,  will remain the same; if they are getting 12/-   a day before the redaction in hours of labour, they will be   getting 12/- a day afterwards; there is no proposal to   reduce wages.  The Commission  was aware that in changing the   hours from 8 to 7,  or from 8  to  6,  as  the case nay be, either   by one or two steps,  there would require to be a readjustment   of piecework rates to enable  them to earn their full wages,   and I think in this Report you will find there is a calcu-   l&amp;tion made on page 10 in clause 7, Clause 7 says: &quot;The   estimated cost of this increase  in  wages and reduction in   hours will be as follows for  the reminder of this present   year&quot;   that is an eatim to, clearly. The wages increase   is estimated to  cost 30 million  pounds.SIR R0B2RT H)RHJs: That is a retrospective increase from the   beginning of the year.MR SMILLIE: That includes the whole.                                11.
 SIR ROBERT HORN5?:  It includes practically a whole year. MR SMELLIIS:  $early a whole year, from the 9th January, MB BO BAB LAW: Yes. MR $MILLIE:  Then it says: &quot;Decreased output at 10 per cent over   six months, making, say,  2nOf()00,OOQ tons for the present   year,-   13,000,000*. SIR ROBERT hjyRM: That is from the 15th July, when it comes into   operation. MR SMILLI^:  Six months reduction he reckons 13 millions,  and I   think: that is reckoned on the fact that there will he * required  to he some re-arrangesat of rates to enable  the   pieceworker,  like the time worker,  to secure the rates  of         ho  had before the hours went down.  Our men*s wages   depend  on tonnage,  the amount of mineral gotten.  We could   not conceive of the day wage men,  who are considerably  over   50 per  cent of the total persons employed underground,   continuing to sarn their full wages with an hour shorter time   while the pieceworkers working at the face would have  their   wages reduced by the a mo unt that their output would he   reduced. SIR HOBIRT &apos;$)RKE:  There must be a readjustment of piece.rates. KSEl E0&amp;\R LAW: That goes without saying:  at least,  so I  under-   stand.M 8!$ L&apos;LX%: We understand that will have to be mutually arranged   in thevarious districts when the time comes between the   employers and th&amp; workmen.ME BOMXi LAW: That is  certainly as I  understood it.  What it means   is that the 7-hour  man is to get the  same wages as he got   before.MR STILUS: That hid wages are not to  suffer because of the   reduction in hours.SIR ROBERT HORHS;  That is as I understand it at present,certainly.MR SMXLIIB:  X  think    Justice Sunkey \vill say he understands  it that way too,  but we only wanted to make sure that that   was  the meaning of  it.
        The result of these Recommendations will mean the   shortening of the working day underground by one hour from   July 16th, 1919,  ani probably by a further hour from July 1920,   but we have already asked you to delete that in this Report -   the deletion of that we have  already  suggested. Now there is   this point,  Sir Robert,  which I think will interest you. If   you have hid time to read our original application to the   Coal Controller,  you will remember that he told us what we   knew already,  that he could  not deal  with the members of our   organisation other than mine  workers  who are under the Coal   Mines Regulation Act.SIR ROBERT HORKS:  Yes,  I  recollect that.JvR SMILLIS:  The stratified ironstone mineas  are under the Act,   but the iron ore  miners,  th2  lead miners,  some ganister   miners,  some clay miners,  and in some cases limestone miners --   in all,  I think,  taking the Cleveland and Cumberland iron ore   miners,  the  few lead miners that are  in Scotland and in   Shropshire,  and the  whole  of  the clay miners,  th$rdo not   amount,  I think,  to  probably  more than 15,000 to 17,000,  but   they are  members  of  our Federation. We told the Coal Controller   that on the  application for hours we  had,  of course,  to come   to the Government, but on the application for wages we told   him that  we  would put  our  application before him,  and that we   would then do as  we  hid done  on two previous occasions,- go   to the Ministry of Munitions,  under whom these people were at   the time  of  our application for the previous war advance. We   then arranged with the Ministry of Munitions for our war   wage to apply at  the same  time to all those people outside,   but we had considerable difficulty in finding out who they   were.  We  ultimately  did find  out,  and we entered into an   agreement, signed by both sides,  that those men employed in   those industries  would be  paid the war frStojj  the same as our   men.  This application is for  them too. But when we applied   to the Ministry of Munitions  in regard to this application,   we were  told that those industries were not now under                            13.
    their supervision, that they had nothing to do  with them, and   we tvoaid awe to apply to the individual employers.  In York-   shire that would mean applying to how many?m immm SMITH: IOS.MR SMELLO, To 105 employers,  because sometimes there  are only   20 or 30 men employed. It would mean applying,  so far  as the   iron ore miners are concerned,  and tte Cleveland ironstone   miners are concerned,  and the lead miners,  to a very large   number of people. We thought that application would -have to   be met by you,  Sir Robert,  as we believe that all those   workers will now be under your jurisdiction.  They have   balloted with, us, and they are on notice with us. In regard   to the application of the shorter hours and the increase in   wages to xjtem xatA this body,  I am sure the most,  if  not all   of those are in all the calculations made by the Commission.   I think many of them,  nearly all of  them, and the coke oven   people on the colliery premises were in the calculations;   and in any 0 ase thsy cannot exceed 17,000 or 10,000. We have   been instructed to ask whether you can discuss  this matter   and give us a reply as to whether or not they would come to   a ny f i na 1 agr e e me at.m BO UAR LAW:  Quite so.MR SMILLI1: The position is that there  would not he a  xmxx&amp;frm   resumption of work at  the coal mines,  in the event  of  a   stoppage taking place,  unless those  people  were dealt  with,   and if there was a stoppage,  then those people  would stop with   the miners and start with them when they resumed work  again.        Those are our points,  I3r Bonar  Law.  I  take it  that this   reduction in the hours of labour will apply to  all  the persons   employed underground.  At the present time,  of course,  the Act   as it stands    what is called the 8 hours  Act  -- excludes   from its provisions deputies,  firemen,  hangers  on,  and I   think, putnp men and horse keepers.  That is  a very small body   of men,  deputies or firemen,  who are both the same  people;   the hangers on prol)ato3y mean  in the case of small  pits  ons                            14.
   or two persons,  and in the case  of  large pits anything up to   eight.SIR ROBERT HORNS: Are you suggesting  that  this should apply to   any of those?MR SMILLIE: Yes.SIR ROBERT BDRHE: You know your  original application was   perfectly clear,  as I  regarded it,  at least; it was for the   substitution of 6 hours for 8 hours in  the 8 hours Act, and   necessarily one imagined that all the other conditions of the   8 hours Act would apply,MR SMILLI1: The application was  for all persons underground and   on the surface,SIR ROBERT H0R1JR: The way in which it  was  put was that you wanted   the substitution of tas word  wsixtt  for  the word MeightM in   the 8 hours Act.MR SMILLI3: Yes, the substitution of 6 for 8 in the Act.SIR ROBSRT HORIS: Which WJCSXSS&amp; necessarily  implied that the people   who are excluded from  the 8 hours regulation in that Act   would also be excluded from the six hours you have asked for   in your application,MR SMILLO: Yes, but you  must remember that in our application   we ask for six hours a day for the above ground men by   including  them in the Act,SIR ROBERT HOIKS; I  know  you made that application at the end,   a little to my surprise,  and  also to the, surprise of the   Prime Minister,  because you will remember he said,  &quot;You have   been maintaining the six hours by reason of the horrible   conditions of the men  who work under the surface, but I do   not understand this six hours for the surface men&quot;. That came   to us rather as a surprise, because I think it has always been   perfectly clearly understood  that yo u were only asking for the   limitation to six hours of the hours of those who had eight   hours applied to them  in the  8 hours Act. This is a new point.MR SMELXI1: Kid not you the resolution of  our annual Conference   before you?
 SIR  ROBERT HDR:^]: I have no doubt I saw the resolution^ the   Southport Conference, but I remember very distinctly  the way   in which you put it  to us as being what you wanted. As  far as   my recollection oarries me now,  I  raised the&apos;question as to   whether what you wanted was a six hours from bank  to  bank, or   what you wanted in that respect. You said 336,  what you wanted   was six hours put in the Act instead of eight.  That is  the   idea I have carried quite clearly in my head from  the   beginning of the matter to the end. MR SJlttLUS: But the moment that Frank Hodges and myself  began   to examine the Act as to now to  include s urface workers, we   found the ACT; would nave to be re-drafted,  apparently. SIR ROBERT tfORSH: You nay have had  that in your head, but you   did not put it forward. MR SMILLIE: But we did discuss it. SIR ROBERT HDRH8: It looks as if you put the same point  in   exactly the same way to Jnar Justice Sankey,  because he. says:   &quot;We recommend that the Coal Mines  Regulation Act, 1908,   cOfluonJLy called the Sight Hours  Act,  be amended by the  sub-   stitution,  ino the clauses limiting the  hours of work  under-   ground,  of the word &apos;seven1  for  the  word  *eight1 H. MR SMTLLIS: Yew. SIR ROBERT BORIS: That is  exactly the way  in which you put your   six-hour problem to me. MR SMTLLIS: Yes,  but surely the same  evidence was before the   Commission and before the people who drafted tne various   reports,  and I think you will find that the  Report signed   by myself  and the others  deals witn tne question of the hours   of the surface workers  being reduced to the  same extent,   because  we  say,  &quot;A corresponding shortening  of the working   day should  apply to the surface  workers&quot;.SIR ROBERT H0RH5:  It is  a  small number,  I  agree, and necessarily   the number  of firemen,  pumpmen and the  rest is small; but   there are  special reasons,  I  take  it, for  their being exempted   from the eight hours  wmch was applied  to  the rest of the
s    undergo und workers, connected with the particular work  uiat *    fireman does. One of course knows that his duties are entirely    different from that of the hewer or the haulage  man or  other    workman underground, and it may very well he that he is    required    stretch his period of service over a longer  number    of hours.  One realises that a fireman may be required  to make    a particular examination on an emergency,  or, without being    exactly of the character of an emergency,  in a fiery pit  he    may he required to come along and investigate.   I  mean  to say    that this problem has never been presented to my mind in any   way that would enable me to form a judgment in favour of whajs   you are now contending for.Mr  SMILLIl: But we are not contending for it  now; we  have con-    tended for it all the time.   As a matter  of  fact,  the  hours    of 80 per cent of that class of  people are 8  hours  or less    than 8 hours a day.Sir R0B1RT BORICS: That may be according to the organisation   of the particular pit,  but it is not so In the Act.Mr  SMXLIIl: Ho.   The reason the Act left  that out was  that it   was thought that those men required to be  in before  the   workmen in the morning to  make their examination, and were   supposed to be there when the men came out at night *  But   they could not possibly do that  in 8 hours, with the conse-   qusnoe that in many oases  - in the majority  of  cases     the hours  of  those men have been reduced by mutual agreement.Sir ROBERT BORIOS: Where kt is convenient I have  no  doubt it may   be done.Mr SMILLIE: There is a double shift over-lapping, because it is   impossible under the Act,  even if  they work 9  hours, to   make their examination in the morning an hour before the men   are in and to  see all the  men out  at night;  they cannot do   it even in 9   hours.   But  we say,  and we have always held,   that those men require  shorter hours  as much as  anybody   because  of  the  nature of their employment.
Sir RDKRRT HORKS: All I am saying now is  this.   That  may very     well be and there may be excellent and conclusive reasons     derived from experience for the contention you are now     putting forward, but I confess,  So far as  the  application     which you.made to us is concerned, I  never  understood that     more was asked for than that six hours sjiould  be applied     instead of eight to those to whom the light Hours Act     applied.Ur VSRmH HARTSHORN: Do you not think that Mr Justice Sankey had     this point in his mind when&apos;he  drafted this first Clause.     because in addition to saying that seven should be substi-     tuted for eight, at the end of  the Clause  he says: &quot;Certain     adjustments must be made in the  hours of the classes of     underground workers specifically mentioned  in  the Act.&quot;Sir ROBSRT HDRH&amp;: W the classes of  underground workers&quot;.Mr V1RM HARTSHORN: That is right, but these are the very     classes of underground workers  specifically mentioned in     the Act.Sir ROBERT HORSOS: That may be abd we  will  ask Mr Justice                                                             [     Sanket about it.                          18.
Mr BONAR LAW:  I think we need not discuss it  further.   Will  you  go   on to your other points?Mr SMIL1IE:  I think you will find there was no doubt in the  minds   of the members of the Qommission that it was to apply to all   people; though I quite admit, with you, that anybody merely   asking, as we did, for the substitution of  six for eight in the   Act would lead one to contend that this same difference would   occur as far as firemen and on-setters are  concerned.Mr CAPS:  A large number of our men have never worked more than   7^- hours.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  I know there are actual variations in existence   all over the country, but how it would apply in every casefc I   have not investigated.Mr SMILLIB:  As compared with the whole thing it is very very small.SIR ROBERT HORSE:  I know; it would cover a very small number of   workmen.Mr BOIAR IAW:  I do not think we need discuss that point further   now.fr SMIL1IE:  We have had a letter sent  to us.   We talked over   with Mr Justice Sankey some  of the points really to try to find   out what he meant by this, because we were not sure on some of   the points.  On Ho. 2, the increase  of wages, his Secretary, Mr   A.B.McIair, writes:  &quot;The  2s. increase in wages is to follow   and be payable as part of  the ordinary wages - that is, wages   other than the war wage   and is to be governed by the practice   regulating those wages.&quot;   I  take it  from that    but perhaps   you would find out from Mr Justice Sankey whether 6r not it is   so  -- that in the  case of  South Wales, where workmen by agree-   ment for years and years have had six  shifts for five, it   should  apply; that is, where an employer, if a man works five   shifts  in the night time,  pays him six shifts; it is to encourager-   rage a man to work his full  five shifts in the night time.  If   he works his full five shifts he gets  six shifts pay.
SIR ROBERT HORBE:  That is to say, he gets wages for the sixth   shift as if he had worked it?Mr HODGES:  Yes, that is it.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  That is a different class of case from what x   you mentioned in your opening remarks.Mr SMILLIE:  Yes, in my opening remarks; but we are not asking   that it should apply to the case I mentioned in my opening   remarks.  We are not asking that he should get this two shil-   lings six times because the custom is to work five days.   But   I was pointing out that the Coal Controller agreed with us that   where it was customary for a class of men to work five days a   week they got six war bonuses; only I do not want this to  apply   there.Mr BOIAR LAW:  I understand the. point of your question, Sir Robert,   to be this, that they gave the war bonus as if it was for  six   days because it was necessary to meet the increased cost of   living.  But what you are asking&apos; now has no relation to the cost   of living, but has. relation specifically to wages.Mr HODGES:  The point is a different point.  The workmen in that   district is treated  Mr B01AR LAW:  As if he got six.Mr HODGES:  And he gets six days&apos;- wages.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  I quite understand.Mr HODGES:  And the custom is that if the workmen there got an   extra 6d a day they got it for six days. &apos;SIR ROBERT HORIE:  Is not that chiefly for night men?Mr HODGES:  All night men and men on the afternoon shift.Mr WIISTOIE:  They have a turn and a fifth for each shift worked,   which means in the end the six shifts for five.  But if they   only work one turn they get a turn and a fifth.Mr VERIO! HARTSHORI:  In some pits.                     ,  .Mr BOIAR LAW:  That does not agree with what I understood was the   object of paying six for five, which was to make the men work   their full five shifts.                          -2a
Mr VERM HARTSHORN:  Under the general agreement  they get  six for   five, but four for four.Mr BOMR LAW:  That is my understanding.Mr VERM HARTSHORI:  Unless their idle time  is  due  to causes over   which they have no control.   If they lose  one shift due  to a   stoppage of work from a fall, or anything  of  that sort,  they get   four and four-fifths.  But Mr Winstone has got  in mind some iso-   lated cases where we have made special agreements that each shift   shall stand on its own as one and one-fifth.  But the  general   agreement is six for five, or four for four,  unless he has a turn   lost through no fault of his own.Mr BOIAR LAW:  Is that all you  wish to put?Mr SMI1LIE:  That is all the points.Mr BOIAR LAW:  Very well; I will try to deal  with  the important   ones you have put before me, but the first thing that I  wish to   put to you very emphatically is that what  we  have undertaken to   do is to carry out Mr Justice Sankey&apos;s Report.Mr SMI1LIE:  Yes,Mr bonar LAW:  I will not repeat now what I said in the House of   Commons that that really is our view.Mr SMILLIE:  And as you repeated in writing to us.Mr BOMR LAW;  Ho; what I mean now is this, that I will not repeat   what I said there and what is our view, that the Government, in   view of the financial position and the effect of coal on trade,   and the share that the nation has to bear in it, has taken a   very considerable risk in agreeing to this report, and has made,   as I think, a very big concession indeed.   But what I want to   point out in regard to that is that in saying definitely, as I   wrote to  you, that we would adhere to this in spirit as well as   in letter, we meant that it must be this Report and no addition   to it in the negotiations now, and I will tell you why tha-G  is   essential.  First of all, if we begin to examine this Report   as to whether or no Mr  Justice Sankey and those who signedY hi&amp;   Report had made  slips,  there is no end to it.  For  example;,    -v                              if.                            fill
   reading Ms Report from the State&apos;s point of view,  one  would   think that the additional cost only meant  13,000,000 on his   assumption, but of course it meanfl probably, or ought to mean,   four-fifths of the  30,000,000 is lost to the State through   the Excess Profits Duty,  Therefore we might say that the whole   thing is on a false foundation, because it is based on  a loss   to the State enormously less than what the actual loss  will be.   I am only giving you that as an illustration.Mr SMI11IE:  May 1 say this now, if you will pardon the interruption-                          with   tion?  I have argued xtefc/Mr Justice Sankey that the State has   already taken that as Excess Profits Duty,  AS a matter of fact   we would have got in nearly all the districts more than this   advance you are now offering; we would have got a 30 per cent.   advance on the prices for coal if we had allowed our wages to   be regulated by prices; and the State has got it.Mr B01AR LAW:  Yes, but we would not have sanctioned the extent   to which prices had gone during the war if the State had not   got it.Mr SMILLIE:  Yes, you would; you would not have broken our agree-   ment.  Perhaps you would not have allowed the price of  coal  Mr BOHAH LAW:  I think certainly we would not have allowed that   last 2/6d if it had been, as far as we knew, simply money   going into the coalowners&apos; pockets.  But that does not  touch   the point I am putting to you, which you see quite clearly.   Anybody who read this without knowledge would say that  all   this means, as far as the taxpayers are concerned, is    13,000,000.  As a matter of fact it means  13,000,000  plus   four-fifths probably; it ought to be four-fifths if the   Treasury has got all it ought to have got of the  30,000,000.   Therefore we might say that the whole thing is on a false basis   in regard to what it is going to cost the State.  I am  only   giving that as one illustration, and we would never raise that   point, of course.  But if we once began to alter the Report,   Sir Robert Horne and the prime Minister, or myself as acting
   for him, would have deputations every day from the  coalowners   saying there is a mistake in,this, that and the other thing,   saying: &quot;If you are altering the Report in one way,  you must   alter that.&quot;  So I think you must take it - thought  I do  not   say there might not be alterations which could be made without   affecting anybody - that as a principle we must adhere to this   Report, and the question is the interpretation of it.   Whatever   is possible in Ir Justice Sankey&apos;s own interpretation of what   this Report means, that,we are prepared to do.   Now let me take, with that preliminary remark,  the  points  which   you have put one by one.  You want the six hours to  be made   statutory.Mr SMILLIE:  Yes.Mr BQNAR LAW;  I quite realise that is a demand to which you  attach   the greatest importance.Mr VERIOI HARTSHORN:  We do.Mr BOIAR LAW:  But apart altogether from the point which I have   put to you now, that it is a complete departure from the Report,   I think it would be rather a difficult thing for the Government   to agree to for this reason.  What the effect of the seven hours   on output would be must be a matter of speculation  very much;   no one can be quite, sure that it will not be a great deal  worse   than this Report says, and some people may hope it  may be  better.   But would it not be really a very rash thing for the Government,   in view of the effect that the coal trade has on the whole of   the industry of the country, to undertake irrespective alto-   gether of what the experience of the seven hourshas shown  to   give six hours a day at a given time?  And even if  the Govern-   ment were to give that pledge, is it a pledge that  could be   kept if experience showed that at the time it was to come  into   operation conditions made it impossible, without ruin to other   industries and perhaps to the export trade of your  own industry?   I think it would be a very difficult thing to do, and a very
   dangerous thing.        Then you want to make it only one year after July, which   of course is quite contrary to this Report.  But even  in  one   year - and there is more probability of it if it is  two      there might be an entirely different Government, and  conditions   might be, entirely altered, and the Government at that  time might   say that it is simply impossible without ruining the  country.Mr SMILLIE:  There might be a different Government before July,   perhaps.Mr BOIAR LAW:  In these things it is always a question of proba-   bilities, and we are more likely to live until July next  than   for two years beyond July.  But what I meant there was that   apart altogether from the change of Government, the conditions   might be so obviously dangerous that the Government would have   to go to the House of Commons and ask that this Act should not   be put into force, and then we would have the kind of thing   you are familiar with, as to breaches of faith and all the rest   of it, with very good cause from the miners I think.   I quite   see the importance of it from your point of view.  If it  is  in   the Act of Parliament it is a very much stronger position for   you to say:  &quot;If there is to be a change, the onus of  making   the change rests upon other people&quot; than if it is the other   way, where if you have to get a change it must be by  another   Act of Parliament.                                            /        But this is a very vital thing.  The meaning of  the  Report   is perfectly plain and unmistakable, and if we were to adopt   this suggestion it would not be adopting Mr Justice Sankey&apos;s   Report, it would be making a policy of our own quite  regardless   of what that Report is.        Then the next thing is the hours of surface workers, and   I think the same thing applies there: that while there is no room   for doubt as to what Mr Justice Sankey means there, this is  a   case where you  simply want an improvement on the Report.   Is it
 J  not eo?Mr SMILLIE:  In what?Mr BONAR LAW:  45 hours a week for the surface workers.Mr SMILLIE:  Yes, we want a change in the Report.Mr BONAR LAW:  It is not a question of interpretation.Mr SMILLIE:  No.Mr BOIAR LAW:  In the case you discussed last, about where the 2s.   is to apply, there we will take entirely Mr Justice  Sankey&apos;s   interpretation of what he himself means.  I should myself have   thought that what he did mean was exactly what  you said last,   that where six days&apos; wages are paid and the payment  is made as   if it were for six days, it should apply.  On that,  I think,   there will be no difference, and we shall probably take Mr Justi   Sankey&apos;s own interpretation.        In regard to the piece rate, I have not any doubt that your   interpretation is the right one, but of course  we will consult   Mr Justice Sankey about that.  I think Mr Hartshorn  is quite   right as far as one not familiar with it can judge,  that the   last clause in that Report very likely does refer to that very                                           it   point; but at all events we will discuss/with Mr Justice Sankey.   low as regards the ironstone mines.Mr SMILLIE:  I may say that it will apply, as you know, all over   the Scottish ironstone mines, because they are under the Act,   and their wages and hours are regulated by the Eight Hours Act.   So that it is only, I think, Cumberland and the Cleveland &amp;ron   ore miners, and perhaps a few miners who are also under the   Eight Hours Act, I think, in the Forest of Bean, and some in   Staffordshire.Mr BOIAR LAW:  And the clay miners.Mr SMILLIE:  Yes, and the  clay miners.Mr BOIAR LAW:  What I was  going to say about that is this.  It is^   very difficult for me to see how the Government could simply   say that such and such  a thing is to be done; because the advan-   - - - - - - -- - i
   with the  reilwaymen,  is  that we  are  the  people who  say Yes or Ho   to it;  we are  the  employers; we  take the risk of  granting your   demands or of  refusing them.   But  I  understand that this is  the   case of people who are in an industry which  is not  under the   Government, which  we  are. not controlling, hut where it is a  case   of private employers. Would it  not  be very  difficult for us   to pas  an Act  affecting  one set  of private employers, while   all the other  private employers  are  left to  fight out their   battles for themselves?   1 quite realise that it  would be a  very   unsatisfactory thing  if  men who  are  in your  Union,  and if they   are in  the same position as you  are, ^euld-be treated different-   ly, and I hope that if the initiative by the Government    ss by   your Department, Sir  Robert    of  trying to  come  to an agreement   (as you are succeeding in doing to a certain extent with the trans-   port workers)  on this subject, it  may be adjusted in this way.      I think   But/xx&quot; you will agree with me  that it would be,  if  not  impossible,   very difficult for the Government  to deal by an Act with  one set   of private employers and not  with  other private  employers.   We   cannot do it  at all.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  Supposing we issued an order, the employers  need   not obey it at all.Mr BOIAR LAW:  It is not our business.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  You cannot dictate to a private  employer  what   he is to pay, any more than you can dictate to  a workman  what   he Shall accept.  The proper course would be for Mr Smillie  to   approach these employers as he does in ordinary circumstances,   and if he finds that he  cannot make any way with them,  if he&apos;   will then ask me to intervene I will do  so.   It is  a very awk-   ward thing for me as it  is.  Just let me put it the other way.   I do not think any of the gentlemen who are in front of me here   would sxptEx  accept it with equanimity if I entered into  imme-   diate communication with the employers, and then told them that   I had had communications from the  employers and I  strongly urged,
   or I went further and. said: &quot;I am instructed that they should do   certain things.&quot;  If I did that, I am sure they would resent it.   and equally so far as the employers are concerned,  if I write to   them and say:  &quot;I have seen the miners about this,  and they are   insisting upon certain things,&quot; I do not know how they will take   it.  The usual way is, after the employers and workmen have been   in communication and a hitch occurs, that the Ministry of labour   may be asked to help.  I am eager to do everything  I can; I am   here, believe me, to aid in the solution of this difficulty, if   there is a difficulty.  But I do not know whether they would make   any objection.Mr BOIAR LAW:  But in any case I think we may put it in this way,   that if you find it impossible to take the initiative you will   discuss it with them.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  Yes.Mr BOIAR LAW:  If you do, you will take the responsibility of   starting the negotiations.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  Certainly.  I would not allow any view of the   ordinary proprieties 4c- let a hitch occur in this matter.  I   agree with what you say, Sir, but I am perfectly certain that   the gentlemen here would not like me interfering with them in   the way it is now suggested that you should interfere with the   employers.Mr BOIAR LAW:  There is one great difference,&apos; in that they have an   advantage the employers have not.  Io Act of Parliament that we   can pass can take you gentlemen under Government control, but   we can pass an Act to take them under Government control.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  That is quite true.Mr BOIAR LAW:  I think that is all I can say.SIR ROBERT HORIE;  What would Mr Smillie suggest about this; what\\Mr SMILLIE:  Supposing there was any hope of our settling thiswould he prefer should be done?
   threatened great calamity,  and a little thing like thiB   SIR ROBERT HORIE:  It would be ridiculous.Mr SMIIiIIE:   at the last moment stood in the way.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  It would be ridiculous.Mr SMI11IE:   It might upset the whole position with  our 850,000   people, that is nearly a million; because it must  be  remembered   that those are our members; they have ballotted, as we have, on   this question fully expecting&apos;, and we also fully expecting that   the question would be settled as we have settled it previously   with the Government.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  Are the people employed in these iron ore mines   and in the ganister and lead mines as to the great majority of   them in your Union, or are they in others?Mr SMILLIE:  They are all with us.  The ganister mines are  chiefly,   if not wholly in Yorkshire, and their hours and wages will be   regulated by our people in Yorkshire; there is no  doubt  about   that; they have been and will be,  If they are not now under   the Eight Hours Act they will make sure that their hours will   be regulated by ours.  Their wages really rise and fall  with   the Yorkshire miners1.  All the ironstone miners of the  country   are members of our association^Mr BOIAR LAW:  And the wages have automatically been  similar?Mr SMILLIE:  In Cleveland they have their own wages board,  and the   iron ore miners of Cumberland have regulated their own wages   up and down.SIR ROBERT HOR IE:  Have they all had the same advances as the miners   have had?                                                 \Mr SMILLIE:  Cleveland has.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  But the Cumberland iron ore miners are paid on   a scale which is their own.                                XMr SMILLIE:  Yes, and they went about 2s. or 3s. beyond  us  at  one   time.
SIR ROBERT HOBOES  Do you suggest that they should have,  under the   exceptional terms they have made with the Ministry of  Munitions,   the additional Ss. a day rate, which you have got?Mr SMILLIE;  Bar claim was put forward for them.SIR ROBERT HORSE:  Are you really suggesting that on the  top of   what the Cumberland minors got for themselves they should still   have the 2s* that the miners have got?Mr SMILLIE:  -Ve do not know at the moment what their conditions are.SIR ROBERT HORSE:  You cannot tell me If you think they are excep-   national .  You must remember that they have very exceptional con-   ditions.Mr SMILLIE:  They are our members at the present moment.SIR ROBERT HORIE;  Are you really telling me that you are suggesting    that the Ironstone miners in Cumberland, with the exceptional    conditions they have got should have a still further advance    of the 2s. flat rate which you have now succeeded in obtaining    for the miners? Mr VERM HAKTSHORN;  There is  just as much variation between the    different districts in the coal industry. SIR ROBERT HORSE;  I agree, but that is because of the differing    s&amp;K&amp;ikxst difficulties in getting coal. Mr VERSOS HAKTSHORI;  So. SIR ROBERT HORHEj  Partly.                                              / Mr VERB OB HARTSHORB:  Even under the general Wages agreement they    have had in  some cases a difference of as much as 15 per  cent.    in their general advances during the war. SIR ROBERT HORSE:   But  I do not really think that if you go  into    the situation of these Cumberland  ironstone miners and  the    agreement which  they have succeeded in  getting from  the Ministry    of Munitions, you would really  come here and  say a that their    case was es  good a  case for  an advance  of gs. per day as  the
   case of the ooal miners  all  over the country.  I do not think   you would say that. Mr SMILLIE:  Could you  tell me whether they have secured one or   both of the war wages that we have?SIR ROBERT HORIE:   They  did not secure it in the same way that you   did, but I think if you  take their wages as a whole you will   find they are better.Mr SMILLIE:  But my point is this.  You will remember the time                                                            i   when a considerable number of men went from the coal mines to   keep up the output of iron ore which was very necessary at the   time.  There was a strike then, and they secured  very  high   wages.SIR ROBERT HORIE:   They  did.Mr SMILLIE:  But I am inclined  to think they have not got either   of the two war wages.SIR ROBERT HORIE:  I think  you  will find  the wage they stand atISigl                             fill; I  lllfll ^ HI I   today is a very favourable one.    That is my difficulty in   saying that we can  treat  this  thing all  on    the  same level.                       JoX
i  MR BO MR LAW:   But I think I  oan say this,  that we recognise       as well as you do,  Mr Smillie,  that to  have a strike of       1,800,000 people-.....-   MR SMILLIE:  There would he 1,000,000 people  involved  in our      own Indus try0   MR BONAR LAW:  There are 1,000,000  people involved in  your       own industry, and supposing there are 17,000  of  these       other people it would he  a tremendous calamity to  lave a       strike, and the Government would do anything  it  could  to       prevent that.   SIR ROBERT BORNE:  Is Mr Gavan Duffy still representing the       Cumberland ironstine men?   MR BODGES:  Through the Cumberland Miners1  Association,  His       Association belongs  to the Cumberland Miners1 Association,       and  the Cumberland Miners&apos; Association belong to us,   SIR ROBERT HORNE:  Of course I have no personal touch with        him at ail.   MR CAPS:   They  have l/bd war wages put on as an increase,   SIR ROBERT H)RNE:   H)W rauoh extra have they?   MR CAFE:  I was just thinking that they  have l/Sd war wage       put on as an  increase.  Sid you know that, Mr Smillie?   MR SMILLIE:  On the  top  of the other advance in wages?   MR CAPE:  Yes.                 0   MR BONAR LAW:   The fact  that  it was l/8d shows that they have        not gone along with you.   MR CAPE:   I do  not know  why  they had l/8d.   MR BONAR LAW:  But your  two advances were l/6d each.   MR SMILLIE:  Yes.   MR BONAR LAW:  While theirs was l/8d.   SIB ROBERT BDHNE:   The real fact is  this,  that they ran their        own negotiations entirely.   They struck,and were dealt      with separately.  They struok again,  and were dealt with        separately  again.   They  struck a  third time, and   got        another particular advance, and  their case has not been
    conducted in line with the  coal miners1 oase at all.  That    is tte situation in regard  to  the Cumberland ore field.    and I do not see how we are going to  treat  it as in the    same position to-day as yours.  I do  not  think you your-    eelves, if you began to look  into that  position would ever    suggest that it should be done.MR HERBERT SMITH;  But we are suggesting  it.  There is another    explanation of that.  They  were  not members of ours when    they went on strike, but they are members of ours now.                                             P     9SIR ROBERT H)RNE:  They acted independently 4p  you.MR HERBERT SMITH.  All I want to  say  is that  I  represent a    fair number of these off-take men,  and  our  members will    not start until their wages are brought into line with    ours.MR WIN8T0NE:  As soon as you begin to differentiate you begin    to get into  trouble.MR BONAR LAW:  But that does not get over the difficulty of    bow it is to be done.  How can the  Government  do  it?   Sup-    posing we were quite willing  to  do  it,  bow  can we do it?MR HERBERT SMITft  You could enforce  it locally.MR SUTTON:  You  can do it as we do it in Lancashire.  In Lan-    oashire we have a number of employers who are  not oonnemted    with the Coalowners&apos; Association.   Whatever we do  in re-    gard to wages, Sir Thomas Ratoliffe-Ellis and  Mr  Ashton    senft it out  to the unassooiated coal owners  telling  them    what is done, and asking them to  do it, and invariably    they do it.MR BONAR LAW:  That is the point.  We are perfectly willing    to do anything you want in regard to that,  but how  can we    do it?  I want you to  help us.SIR ROBERT HDRNE:  I wleh you would suggest a way out of  the    difficulty.MR BONAR LAW:  We see the difficulties as clearly as  you.MR SMILLIE:  Mr  Smith and I ted tp go to tha Ministry of
Munitions to secure the war wage for about 160 lead miners.I had the balance sheets of the Company with me*  Theyhad returned, X think, fry ice over to their shareholdersthe capital of the Company during the previous three orfour years,  The Chairman of the Company came there and   said that he wasAgoing to pay this, that If anything was    to be paid the Government would have to pay it.  The Gov-    ernment representatives said that they were not going to    pay it, but they would find out from his books whether he    was able to pay it or not.  But I said:-&quot;! will lend you    his balance sheets now, though I think you have them at    headquarter s**ME BC27AR LAW:  That was easy, because we were then the only    buyers.SIR ROBERT H3RJS0S:  And the sane with regard to the Cumberland    ore field j the Ministry of Munitions took it over at that    time.MR BOIAR LAW;  And even if we had not absolutely taken it   over we were the only buyers, so that we had absolute    power.MR SMILLIE:  We will require iron ore probably more in the    future, but we could not allow those men to go on working    producing iron ore in view of the fact that we have    claimed an increase in their wages.SIR ROBERT HDRNE:  Yes, but can you tell me what their wages    are to-day, as compared with your own for example?ICR SMILLIE:  I really could not, but I can tell you in regard    to Yorkshire wages to-day or South Wales to-day, as corn-    pared with Bristol miners1 or Somerset mineral wages,    that there is a far bigger difference between the Somerset    and Yorkshire than there is between the Yorkshire miners1    wages and other districts.MR BOIAR LAW:  That does not meet the case, because 44-4*. no-    these ironstone miners in Cumberland w&amp; get much highernot
    wages tfcan the coal men in Cumberland, whs.t  then?  Po you    still say that they should get the  advance?MR VERNON HARTSHORN:   What we say is,  that whatever  the pres-    ent position is,  the same relative  position  should he    maintained in every case.MR BONAR LAW:  Is that really reasonable in view of  the fact    that the present relative position waB due entirely to    what they got being something so essential to the war    that it was taken under  Government controls  but that    position has ceased.MR VERION HARTS IORN:   We have made our  case for  the  miners.    If we had made our case on some of  the districts we should    have had a case for 60 or 60 per cent easily. We  have    make.de it on the general situation,  and if  you are going  to    begin to differentiate between one  district  and  another,    and the relative position of one district and another,  we    shall find ourselves in an impossible position.SIR ROBERT IDRNE:  Yes, but that is not quite the point, you see\    You made your case on coal a general case.   There  has been    no case made on irons tone j in Tact it was not within  the    ferms of this Reference.  Now you can easily see what an    extraordinary situation would be created  if  the  ironstone    miners in Cumberland are already receiving wages higher    than the miners- I cannot say that they  do, but it may    be the Union men can tell me-- if you are going  to give    another advance.                             /MR. V1RN0N HARTSHDRN;   I do not know the facts in those oases.MR BONAR LAW:  Well,  Mr Smillie, I cannot say how we can do            whether    this orA3XKt X x it is possible for us  to do it, but  this    we could do.  We could say:-&quot;You are to pay  these wages&quot;j    we could pass an Act of Parliament if you like,  if you    assume that it is possible to do that in regard  to one    particular set of employers and not to another.  But no    power which the Government has could make the mines go  on.
    We may not have t ha-power to do it,  hut we are recognising    that we cannot have a strike over this,  and we are ready    to do anything in reason that a Government can do to bring    the position into line.MR SMILLIEs  1 was asked to call your attention in  this oon-    nection to the iron mines of the Isle of Raaeay.  As you    know, the Isle of Raasay was opened up,  and when the Min-    minimun Wage Act was before the House and the rules were    being drafted, they very skilfully put in a Clause  to  this    effects &quot;This shall apply to the Mainland of  Scotland&quot;,    and thus kept the Isle of Raaeay out of  it.   They are    developing the mijies on that Island, and most of the    workers on the Island are members of our Association.  I    think the Mines Regulation Act applies to  them,  but I  am    inclined to think-----------SIR ROBERT IDRHE:  It must apply,MR SMILLIE:  Yes, I think it does.SIR ROBERT H)RHE:  It must apply,  but I did not  know that    differentiating circumstance at all.MR SMILLIE:  That was only for the minimum wage when we were    settling it,MR BONAR LAW:  One can see the reason for it.  At that  time,    as you know Mr Smillie, it was a gamble  of  the wildest    kind.  If you had asked nine men out of  ten in Glasgow,    they would have said it was nonsense to  expect  to get    iron ore there,                             /MR SMILLIE:  But when the Minimum Wage Act was going through    it was proved, and miners were working there, and they had    splendid iron ore,MR BONAR LAW:  But probably even then it had not  began  to  get    profits, and it was doubtful whether it would get profits.    That was probably the reason.MR SMILLIE:  As a matter of fact they wanted to get cheap    labour, and they got the Highlanders over at   1 a week    while tney were probably paying much more on the mainland.
    Mr Forgie said that was the reason they wanted  them.   They    had had a strike there, and now they are  regulated  by    ourselves.MR BONAR LAW:  Well now, what is the next step?MR BUTTON:  Has anything been said about the  2/6d?MR BONAR LAW:  That was covered by what I said about Mr Jus-    tioe Sankey1 e interpretation.MR VERNON HARISHDRN:  Are we to accept it that you  have given    your last word, that there can be no Six.  Ifrurs  unocndit-    lonally either in 1920 or 1921?MR BONAR LAW:  I do not like to say the last  word about any-    thing,MR VERNON HARTSHORN:  I hope you will not, at any rate  on that    or on the surface workers.MR BONAR LAW;  But I must say that I cannot see  any way by    which we can do that.MR SMILLIE:  I Jfcake it you are going to talk  that over  with    Mr Justice Sankey or the Commission, and  that you will not    finally make up your mind-- subject  to what  you have  said    here-- that that Report is what you have  agreed to  accept,    as you said in the Bouse of Commons and  in your reply to    us.  You  have said that,while in matters  of  principle    you are unlikely to give concessions, you will  talk over    the other matters with Mr Justice Sankey,  That is  a ques-    tion which Z should like you to talk over with the  Judge    and hear what  his view is, because in all our discussions    we have never  thought of anything more than six months    from one  step  to the other.MR BONAR LAW:  X will certainly do tmt, and  as  far as  what    you have  said I will say no less in regard to it this    afternoon, but I think it would not be fair  not to  tell    you the things where I do not think we can by any possi-    bility give way.  This is not a question of  interpretation.MR KBilLLIE:   No.                             /
MR BONAR LAW:  This is really an entire departure from tte    Report.MR VERN0N BARTSK)RN:  I think it is only right that some  of    us 8h)uld say that we should he irrsoonoileably opposed    to a settlement unless we did get a settlement of  this,    whatever others may feel.MR GEORGE BARKER:  I do not think that the surface men would    accept the hours that Mr Justice Sankey has laid down,    because they do not bring them into line with the  under-    ground men.MR BOIIAR LAW:  What Mr Hartshorn has said Is very serious,    but I never thought that the sky would come clear. I    know how dangerous the present state of things is. But    what you practically are saying to rae is:-&quot;We will take    what we like in this Report, but we must have added to    it otter things which we think are essential&quot;.MR VERNOH HARTS H3RN:  No, what we say is, and what Mr  Smillie    has been putting to you is that we are asking if it is    not possible to effect a settlement.  We are not asking,    as we might have asked, for the adoption of the Majority    Report, or the Report which was signed by the largest    number of members of the Commission.  Surely Mr Justice    Sankey1 s Report is not the Report of the Commission.  It    is only one of three Reports.  We might have insisted    upon the other Report which was signed by the six  men,    but we are not doing that. We are asking for a Six  Hours    Day, ana we propose to get it in stagesj we are agreeing    to that.  But we do want a Six Hours Bay secured to us    some time, arid that is not done in this Report. We want    something different on the Eburs question.  We are not    asking you to concede everything that we asked for orig-    inally, or everything that some of the Commissioners  have    reported on,  but I do not think it is possible to  get a    settlement unless we can get some modifications.
MR BONAR LAW:  I have told you that I  am not going to say tho    last word about anything,  but for  all that X do  not  think    anything has ever been gained by simply dragging the thing    on,MR VERM HARTSH)BN:  I quite agree,MR BONAR LAW:  By saying that I am going to give something    that I really cannot give, X do not think you gentlemen    realize what a tremendous thing this is, and that the more    it is examined from the point of view of its effeot  on    trade-- on the ooal trade and other trades-- the more    people would be frightened of it,   X do not  think you    quite realise that,  X think at first blush, when X  men-    tioned this in the House of Commons, everybody was pleased,    because they thought:-&quot;Now this is a way of getting  over    this terrible danger&quot;.  But the more it is examined  the    more they will be frightened of it.  What we did say right    off was: &quot;Well now, here is a Report of an impartial    Judge, signed by three othersj we  will take whateverresponsibility there is in adopting  that&quot;.   But  it wouldbe a very very difficult thing to go on improving  it from your point of view,
MR V?RM HARTSHORN:  But  I  think you must agree that that   Report is an inducement,  even if  we accepted it as it ifc,   to have a rumpus of  this  sort next year, We might just as   well settle the matter once  for all one way ox the other.   1 do not think it is possible to  got it hung up.MR BONAR LAW: Is that really quite the way to look at it? You   never get anything in this world  all at ftfloe.m V2SRN0N HARTSIDEN:  We  are not asking for it all at once.   fe did, but we agreed  to  take it  in stages, and we want to   get it at some time, and  we  weald like to know that it is   there.MR BO HAH LAW: There is  a  point  that  I do not think people have   realised now from the  point  of vie?/ of wages. Of course,   wages are still far  from being  too high from your point of                            arc   view or mine, but theyjijramthe  result of the war,and partly   the result of the inareased  cost  of living because of the   war. This is a question pf prophecy, and I dare say other   people will think differently,  but my own view is that long   before  the end of this year  the oost of living will he very   much reduced, unless there is some calamity that I do not   now see.MR VMON HARTSHORN: And  the coat  of production too.MR BONAR LAW: Of course,  the cost  of production is anticipated   here and accounted for.  1 hope  it will be realised. If it   is  not, 1 think it would be  very  fatal for you all. It is   taken into account already.  The other is not taken into   account in any way,MR BODGES: If you have  the date fixed at 1920, the whole   industry strains itself to becoae absolutely prepared for it   on  that fixed date.  You would  have saved these big adjustments   that will have to be nude now  for the first year. If every -   body in the industry - tho  workmen and  the tehcnical people--   knows  that the change is  to  be  mad  on a given date, tea   whole industry adapts itself to that onange in advance,                               3 4$SI
S2   If it is indefinite,  the change has to come at a certain time   when the industry  is  not prepared for it.MR BONAR LAW:  That is perfectly  true, Mr Hodges,  hut that does   assume,  does it not,  that  trade can stand it   that it is   possible for it to stand a six-hours day at that time?MR HODGES:  You have 15 months in order that the industry might   adapt itself to the new conditions.MR BONAR LAW:  But there  are some conditions that no industry   can adapt itself to.SIR ROBERT HORNS: It  is  the last straw that breaks the camel1 s   back,MR BQDGIS:  What are they?MR BONAR LAW:  You might, for  instance, instead of asking for 30   per cent,  ask for  200 per  cent imrease, and what amount of   time would enable  the industry to adapt itself to that?   It would be impossible.MR HODGlS:  And no amount of words could measure our sanity or   insanity if we did that,SIR ROBERT HORNS: It  is  a question of degree.MR BONAR LAW:  Is it not  only  a question of degree? I do not   wish to  argue it,  because  I say the thing will be considered   for what it is worth,MR SMIIiLH: But you must remember that the Durham miners have  had   a six hours day for 40 years,MR BONAR LAW:  Is it not  possible that their seams are sufficiently                                           /   different to make  it  possible in one place and not in another?MR SMILLIE:  I think  there is as much difference between one part   of the county and  another  as  there is between one part of the   country and another,MR BONAR LAW:  If you are right in what you anticipate; if it is   true, as I  hope it is, that the change  to 7 hours will not   have the big effect in reducing output  that people suspect,   why should we be afraid to have the case put again after we   have hid experience of the 7  hours?MR SMILIO: If we were asking to have it done by legislation,                                    4il
   what we would d0, would &quot;be  to  fix a date when we are going to   begin, not a 6-hour day  by steps, but a six-hour day, and we   would tell the employers:  &quot;A  month from this time our men are   going to atop at the end of six hours&quot;. That is what we would   do. We could do it,  and  the employers would adapt themselves   to it, and it would take place.MR BONAR LAW: That is to say,  if there was not a strike about it.MR SULLIS: There would not require to be a strike.SIR ROBERT HORN&amp;!: The employers  might say they would not go on.M SJJXLLIl: They might like to say it.MR BONAR LAW: What you mean is that the men would only work six   hours a day.MR SMILU72: Yes; simply on  a  given date make  up our minds only   to work six hours a day.MR BONAR LAW: If they did not run the shafts  up,  what \?ould happen?MR SMJLLXJS: If they did not run  the shafts up or down,  they would   lock the men out,  that is  all. But they would immediately begin   and prepare their machinery for taking out the output, if we   gave them three or four  months notice.MR BONAR LAW: That assumes  it can be done.MR SMILLIE: Yes, it can be  done,MR BONAR LAW: Without injuring the trade.MR VSRNON HARTSHORN:   What  they  would probably do would be to   cut down t.he \?&amp;ges after knocking a oouple of hours off, and   we would have a strike or  a lockout in any case.MR SMTLLIlr We asked the lib use of Commons SO years ago to give   us an eight hours day from bank to bank, Weraasxa went again   and again to Parliament, and  there was all sorts of trouble   about itjs&amp;a Commission was appointed about it,  and the House   of Commons ultimately agreed  to give us an 8 hours day from   bank to bank, but it was changed in the House of Lords, and   it became, not an 8 hours  day from bank to bank, but a 9 hours   day. That is a considerable time ago; it is surely not too   much to ask now for a change  in the hours  of labour. However,   we have discussed all that, and we really do not think that
   the second step should  depend on something which may happen   12 or 18 months after  this.MR BO BAR LAW: I  quite  agree with you. I listened with pleasure to   what you said just  now about how much simpler it would be if   you could say: WS want this&quot;, and it will be done, than   bothering with the  House cf Commons, But then that applies to   a lot of things,MR V3DR3M HARTSHORN: If it will relieve you of any trouble,   we will do it that  way,MR BONAR LAWS I  like that suggestion, and I should like to know   what method you have of relieving me of trouble.MR BUTTON: I think he  is  afraid of  getting into trouble, and that   is why he is  afraid to alter Mr Justice Sankey1 s Report.MR BOIAR LAW: That is  perfectly true, and that is not an  un-reasonahle thing,m        HARTSHORN: Mr Justice Sankey fs Report unmodified cannot   avoid trouble.MR BONAR LAW: That is  not an  unreasonable thing. We have got in   the nation a  variety of interests   a great variety of interest-   I myself am surprised  hat this  Ms been accepted without more   outcry, from other  sections, I mean,  than what we have  met with.   We have got to consider, you are perfectly right, forces of all   kinds as well as yours.MR H)DG1S: Do not you think  that  the Commissions revelations   rather subdued criticism in advance?MR BONAR LAW: Do not you  think it is possible that it is partly   due to your cleverness and Mr  Smillie^?MR HDDGSS: No, I think it is  the  revelations  made about the Coal   Controller&apos;s Department.MR BONAR LAW: Do not you  think it is  partly  due  to  the  way the   ease was presented?MR SMILLIE: 1 consider it was due to  the facts.SIR  ROBERT HDRNE:  In any  case,  Mr Justice Sankey  heard  all the   evidence,  much of which the  public did not  hear at  all,  and   he  has come to  certain conclusions,  and it is  very  difficult
    for  the public to oome to aiy conclusions. MR VERNON &quot;HARTSHORN: I think you want to bear in mini the fact    that was  impressed  upon us when the Commission was set up,    that its  findings would not prejudice anything that we had    determined  upon -  that we were not to be prejudiced by the    Commission.) MR BONAR LAW:  Certainly. MR VKRM HARTSHORN: In any case, if we had had an adverse    decision  of the Commission, it probably would have been a    very strong factor  against us, but we have not got a decision    which is  adverse to us. SIR ROBERT HORN)?.: When you stated that a majority of the Commission    had  said  certain things, it is perfectly true that there were    six  who  signed one  Report, but you must remeniber that there    were seven  members  out of 13 against the 30 per cent advance,    and  against the immediate award of a six hours day, and against    giving nationalisation at once - that is the way to look at    it.  Whilst  the other two Reports were divided in numbers,    there was not a majority for your particular contention. MR V^RNON HARTSHORN: I quite agree; but you have three Reports,    and  you have 13 men divided amongst  themselves. It is not    much to be  surprised at that we should not entirely agree. SIR ROBERT BORNE: I follow that.                                   IJGO MR VSRNON HARTSHORN:   And it is  not/much to ask that you should    modify that Report. MR BONAR LAW;  That is  perfectly  true, but what you have said    really comes to this, that you are not bound by this Report.    Neither are you; you are  under no obligation to submit to it    or to any Report, but  that means that you simply present your    case without regard to this Report, and it must be judged on    its  merits. If so,  everything must be judged on its merits -    the  whole thing. MR VOTON HARTSHORN: Yes, but 1  take it the Government are  not    quite entitled to set aside the opinion of everyone else, and    to merely take the  opinions of these fiour men.                           lf3T                       We  are
   fairly entitled to ask you to consider  the  others,MR BO MR LAW: I do not think it is  quite  that.  What X  thought   myself when this Commission was  set up  was  that very  likely   there would he three Reports, six on one side  and  six on the   other, and a Report signed by the Chair nan alone.  X thought   that would very likely Come about.  The  fact that these others   agreed with Mr Justice Sankey does  make the Report have much   more influence. MR SMLLI32; When do you expect that you will  be  able to give us   a reply?SIR ROBERT HOR282: We shall see Mr Justice  Sankey  to-day  or to-   morrow, if we cannot to-day.MR SMELLIS: I suppose it will not be of any use our seeing you   again at any future time?MR BO MR LAW:  I think it would be of  use,  Ms  Smillie, that there   should be some means either of myself  or the Minister of Labour   seeing some of you again.MR SMLLI32: Our         meetr on Wednesday,  but some of us have   been away from our homes for a very considorable time,  and   would like to get a rest.SIR ROBSRT fflRM: When would you be back?MR SMILLIE: We would not be back until Wednesday  morning?SIR ROBSRT HDR33B5: Can I communicate with Mr Hedges?MR SMILLI7,: Yes,SIR ROBSRT HDR3SG5: I will be seeing Mr Hartshorn at  the House of   Commons, perhjjps.                       mr. VERM HARTSHORN: Yes, but I should imagine it is  a business   for the whole iSxecutive.MR TOTOR:  Say Tuesday, Mr Smillie.MR VERM HARTSHORN:  Why not take another week at  it, and get   a holiday afterwards?MR BO MR LAW: I really do not know what to say to you now. I think   I have ms,de it quite plain what I think must happen.MR VMM HARTSBORB: I hope you will think differently between now   and the next time we meet you.                              4^,S6
MR SUTON: We want to put BO ire thing very definite and very   favourable before  the Confers roe, if it is possible,  on   Wednesday.MR BONAR LAW: Yes,  and we want you  to. As regards meeting again,   I will leave it to you; I will see you at any time you want   me to.MR SMILLIE: Could you meet our Executive on Tuesday for a short   time?MR BONAR LAW:  Yes, if you wish me  to, and I would be quite glad,   but I do not like  to have it put quite like Yes or No.   I suppose that is what you mean, is it not?MR SMILLIB: We would  like to hear your answer first on this point.   There is none of us who desires  to get an unsatisfactory answer   for the purpose of calling the men out on strike.MR BONAR LAW: I know  that.MR SMILLIE: We would  like it if we  could get an answer on which   we were justified  in asking the  men to go on working.MR BONAR LAW: We know your difficulties, and you know ours.MR SMILLIE: Yes.SIR ROBERT BORNE: You have  not cleared my mind about the iron-&apos;   stone workers.MR SUTTON: That will  work itself out; that will come right.SIR ROBERT HORNS: How do you communicate with the ironstone   employers? I do not know who  they are; I have never load any   touch with them, I do not know whether there is any Federation   of them or not.MR CAPE: Bo you mean the employers  in Cumberland?SIR ROBERT HORNS; Yes.MR CAPE: I think it is Mr Casson. I sent the address on to our   Secretary in our own office.MR HODGES: I think by then we might be able to give you the names   of all the employers from the various districts employing   this class of workmen, and we might be in a position to make a   proposition to you when we meet  you  next.SIR ROBERT HORNS: Can you make a proposition to the employers
   first,  arid learn what their attitude is? Is it any good? MR HODGES: There is no more  use  in making a separate proposition   to them before this decision than making it to separate coal-   owners now.  It is not a bit of use.MR BO MR LAW: Have you any means  of  communicating by your organis-   ation with the employers&apos;  organisation of these ironstone   miners?MR HDBGSS: Yes,  we have the means of communicating with them   through the districts.MR BOflAR $At: Would not that  be the  best  way of doing it from   the practical point of view?MR HOBGfSS: Sach separate employer knows that his men are on notice,   in order to get this concession from him.MR BONAR LAW: One would like  to get  a statement from them that   they would agree to whatever is done by the men,SIR ROBERT HORH?: Yes,  but there  may be very exceptional cire urn-   stances in particular cases. It is a horrible problem for a   person at the centre. You  are  in touch with all these things;   I am not at all. I  do not  know why you are so gingerly about   approaching the employers  on this matter.MR HODGES: It should be so obvious that it is futile to approach   any individual employers at this  stage -absolutely futile.SIR R0B1RT B0R3K: How  do you  think the Government are going to   do it?MR HDDGBS: The Government are the only people who can do anything   at this stage, because they could say  to^these people: wWe   expect you to observe the  decision that has been arrived at   in respect of the coal minersSIR R0B3RT HDRHl: Without knowing anything about the conditions -   you who represent these miners are absolutely unable to tell   ma what their conditions and rates of  wages are - that is a   little bit stiff.MR HDDG13: I do not thi nk we  are  quite in that position. But what   we can tell you is,  as his already been said, that we have not   differentiated between the various rates indifferent districts
   in making ourap plication. In reducing it to 30 per cent,  we   reduced it to  a figure which we thought would represent a fair   average on the whole coalfield, including ganister, lead,   ironstone miners,  etc.MR BO MR LAW: That does not help  us to get over the difficulty   that we are in towards them or to what we are towards the  coal-owners.MR HODGES: What I would suggest is that you should get the names   of the different  employers, because they are all separate,  and   in some cases  they are in  no Association at all. They should   he communicated with by you,SIR ROBERT HORNE: Why? I have no power at all.MR HODGES; Because it is really up to you now to prevent a strike.SIR ROBERT horne: You are entirely mistaking the whole situation   of labour in this country. If I were to enter into communi-   c a tion with individual sets of men in any particular district,   and tell them that I expect them to do a particular thing,  you   would rise up  in  arms against  me at once, and quite rightly.   You would say: &quot;What on earth  is the Government interfering   here for? Are  we  in a slave-driven country?&quot; And now you are   asking me to do the same thing in regard to the employers.MR HODGES: In that case you would not be doing anything different   from what you did before the coal mines passed  under the   Controller.SIR ROBERT HORNS: No, no!MR RODG^S: You did meet and settle the great Welsh strike of 1915.SIR ROBERT BORNE:  That was after  there had been cornmunications   between the employers and  the  men. But here you are asking me   to act before  there has been any communication between the   employers and  the  man at all;  that is the difficulty,MR SMILLI?: The real  reason why we have not done anytning in the   shape of approaching  the employers is that we were waiting to   see whether we could  settle  our claim.SIR ROBERT RORNE:  I quite  understand that.MR SMILHl:  Supposing we  settled with you,we would immediately
\   have applied to tho other employers,  aaying;  &quot;You must follow   what the Govoramt ;nt naa &amp;om*.  I  think it  io  possible that we   shall be able to do something if  you leave it to  us,m TOFW OTTH: We do not want you to interfere with us at all   in Yorkshire. We know their wages.SIR ROBERT HOOT: Exactly; that is what I anticipated you would   say. That only proves my point.MR SMILLIE: We are muoh obliged to you,. Mr Bonar Law,  for   receiving us. Will you fix four o&apos;o.lock on Tuesday?MR BO MAR LAW: Yes, if you like.            (The Bep utat ion t he n wi % heir ew).
