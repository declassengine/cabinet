WAR CABINET.T; 7042,.                .------            The Retention of^ Prisoners and ,SojLdiers on the Land.     Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.          In accordance T.7ith the decision of the v/ar Cabinet,\7.C.551, Uinute 3  (b), I make the following observations on theretention of German prisoners on the land,   I add a report on the.general situation  of Agricultural labour.          There are at present 28,500 prisoners working on the landin England and -/ales.   These men are skilled agriculturists engaged on skilled work, and it  is important that their services should beretained as long as possible.          In a memorandum circulated bv Sir Auckland Geddes (G.T,7022) on the State of ^mplorment in Sussex, it is alleged that german prisoner labour is taking the place of casual (not permanent)British labour, because prisoner labour need not be employed in wetweather.   But casual labour equally is never employed in bad weather, and is presumably  -nskilled.   The suggestion therefore isthat farmers should be required to employ unskilled labour, thesurplus of other industries, at the same rate of wa^es as thosewhich are paid for skilled agriculturists-.          The condition of agricultural labour is at the presentmoment ver*r disturbed, &quot;and there is no doubt that farmers hesitate to embitter still  further the relations between themselves and themen whom the1&apos;- permanently employ.   If an arrangement could be made whereby the former should pay to unskilled workers less than thecurrent rate of wages for the first two months, the difficulty miw;htbe partially removed.          The statistics of the labour position to-da^ in Agriculture.are as follows:- The number of male workers regular!-&quot;- employed on the land in   England and V/ales in 1914, was about     ,,,   ......   718,000 The number regularly employed at the date of the Armistice   (excluding soldiers and prisoners )was   ......   ...   412,000 The deficiency of rsgulp$ workers was, therefore, apart from   the additional labour required for the increased area   (1,500,000 acres) of plough land.............   305,000 The number of agriculturists in Great Britain stated to have   been demobi] ised to date  (March 25) is   .........   174,000   Reports received indicate that many of these men are not   returning to agriculture.  ITo figures are available to   show what proportion of the demobilised men belong to   England and -ales or to Scotland respectively. The present deficient of regular- male civilian workers in   England and &apos;.&apos;.ales who are skilled, therefore is      ...   132,000   even if all agricultural workers released return to farm   work and all the demobilised men &quot;belong to England and   Vales.
This deficiency is partly provided for bv the  follovrin^ .&quot;controlled&quot;.-labour still on - tho,land:-         Soldiers..........27,000         Prisoners .........  28,500                                                        55,500 The present deficiency is therefore upwards of          70,500t -  men. ,             ...   ;                  -  ... If the prisoners are vrithdrawn,  this deficiency is   increased to............   ......      105,000          It is therefore submitted that in the present criticalposition of agriculture, *..rith the epring seeing approaching,  andthe exceptionally adverse season, with continuous rain for thelast seven months,  it is vitally necessary to retain these prisoners as lon^ as possible.          The Board has also received notice that, of the soldiersnow working on the land, 25,000 men will be taken within the nextfortnight for the Army of Occupation.    These men are skilledagricultural workers,    Seventy per cent, of them are belowcategory A.   If the^ are withdrawn, as well as the German prisoners,the deficiency of skilled agricultural workers in England and &quot;alesis  132,000 men at the most critical season of the year.          The local papers are filled with advertisements from farmers for skilled agriculturists.   In Lancashire,  the best farmhands are asking and receiving 50/- a week, which is evidence that farmers are prepared to pa** high wa^es for skilled men whereverobtainable,          In the opinion of the Board it is vital, in the interestsof food production, that     (l)  the German prisoners at present employed in Agriculture             should be retained for a further period;  and     (2)  the 25,000 soldiers recalled to military duty should             be allowed to remain on the land for the next two             months, or that a corresponding number of skilled             agriculturists should be released on furlough.to             take their place.ERELS.March 23th, 1*19.
