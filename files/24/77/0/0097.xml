The  number.of applications  received during the  past week was 35,  and the  total value  of machinery ordered from the beginningof the present year,  to date, under tho  Scheme,  amounts to  14,929.                      TILLAGE  SECTION.               The  Department have issued  during the week theTillage (Ireland) General No.2. Order, 1919,  (ct*py attached),  whichrevokes the Tillage (Ireland) General Order,  1919.   Under the new&apos;Order occupiers of ten or more statute acres  of arable land are re-quired to cultivate in 1919 an area equivalent to 15 per cent  ofthoir arable land.    The excoptions specified in the new Order aresimilar to those embodied in the revoked Ordor.               Notices- of the Department&apos;B Intention to issuecertificates of default were served, in three  additional caBeB  duringthe week.  The holdings concerned are situated In fcka Counties Meath,Tipperary and Wicklow, and the amounts of the penalties specified arerespectively  333. 15.,  332. 10., and  52. 10.                   PROGRESS OP FARM W0RKo               Weather and  soil  conditions were  admirable  fortillage  operations  in  southern and weotern counties.   In northerncounties the  earlier part  of  the  week was  cold and harsh..Pastures have everywhere been chocked by koen frosty  winds, and winter wheat  and  catch crops  have also received a set back  from thiscause.               The  sowing  of  grain and potatoes is backward, havingbeen retarded by  unfavourable weather, and in some districts by labour troubles,  and by  the  prevalence of  &quot;the influenza epidemic.Farmers  are,  however,  ready  to take  advantage of improved conditions,and the  coming week should see a  large proportion of  the work ofsowing completed.              Reports  indicate a  tendency  among farmers to  sow morebarloy than herotcfore,  and  to increase the  area  laid down  withgrass soedo,  notwithstanding the  very high prices of  grass  cood                                                      mixtures9/4/19.
?ixtures. A considerable extension of the area under oats is reported from County Limerick.                    ARTIFICIAL MATURES.

A shortage of artificial fertilisers is notified from ?overal counties; but it is expected that fairly adequate supplies will be available before the close of the sowing season, the Majority of farmers who purchase  large quantities having already secured their requirements. Irish farmers are showing increasing appreciation of the value of sulphate of ammonia as a fertiliser, ?and its use during the present season is widespread.

FARM  LABOUR.

Strikes of farm labourers are reported from the Counties of Donegal, Down and Kerry, while several other counties are not free from labour troubles. A strike in County Antrim was settled during the week, and conditions are improving in County Cork, where an early return to something like normal conditions is hoped for.

F L A X.

Flax Growing Operations. Sowing operations have been commenced in Co. Cork and in several other early districts. As farm work in general is in a very backward condition only a small proportion of the flax crop will be sown this year before the end of April.

Labour. The strikes of farm labourers which have occurred in several districts in Counties Down and Donegal are having a very serious effect in influencing farmers to sow a much smaller area of flax than they had intended.

Demand for Flaxseed. The demand  for flaxseed is still dull.  About 20,000 bags of seed have been purchased by wholesale merchants from the Government, and this would only represent a quantity sufficient to sow 40,000 acres. As farmers this coason? have deferred purchasing ?eed till the last moment, it is still probable that a substantial additional quantity of soed may yet be purchased from the Government. The indications at present are that the area of flax this year will hardly exceed 80,000 acres, as compared with 143,000 acres in 1918.

Home Saved Flaxseed. Seventeen applications have been received from farmers during the week for permits to soil homesaved soed to merchants, and 3 permits were granted authorising the sale of 60 bags.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from lst to 7th instant, inclusive,applications for licences were received as follows:-      To slaughter or export  heifers...............220

To Slaughter bulls or bullocks................ 32

To export milch cowe...........................130

To slaughter  veal calves..........*...........5.
