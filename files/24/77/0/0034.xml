 This  Document is the PrgpertjL2LHis Britannic Maiostv&apos;8 Coveni;,^.I circulate the following for the consideration             of the Cabinet.-.Oj^) Laming  aorthington Lvans.acrandum on proposed  Decentralization     of the kinistry  of  Pensions,              i-JLiustry of Pensions has four permaneiit and onetemporary functiens.1,2,3,4.5.The granting of pensions to disabled officers and menand their widows children and dependants.The medical treatment of disabled officers and menincluding provision of artificial limbs and appliances.The Training, while under medical supervision of thepartly disabled.   (Industrial training and employmenthave been transferred to the Kinistry of Labour).The care of neglected children in respect of whomallowances are payable.Until the emergency army is disbanded, the supplenienta-tion of separation and other allowances to the wiveschildren and dependants of serving soldiers.     All pensions are granted and issued in London; theLondon staff engaged in assessing the pensions number, about,000 and that engaged in issuing number 4,000.     The present administrative expenditure of the headquarters staff, apart from accommodation, is at the rate of  1,250,&apos;per annum.                                     J     Local enquiries are carried out through Local VvarPensions Committees and Sub-Committees.     These Committees and Sub-Committees also make arrange-ments for placing the disabled individual^treatment and training and make allowances therefor, make advances pending tho issueof an award to disabled men, and pay supplementary separation allowances.     Their administrative expenditure is estimated at &quot;the -rate of  500,000 per annum.    The centralised -system has the following general results:-1.   The first awards of pensions of soldiers discharged unfit     from Hospital are as a rule made within 28 drys which     is satisfactory.2.   The first awards in respect of demobilised soldiers     (L cases), and of those who claim after demobilisation     (Art.9 cases) would show great delay if the normal     &quot;procedure were followed; as a temporary measure certain     checks and safeguards have been abandoned to reduce d^Iaya,
where alternative pensions are claiiaed, there isneed for local enquiry and the delays are not lossthan 3 months; many cases take much longer, up to months.If an award is refused, and an appeal is made to theTribunal, the average time taken in 1918 was 335 days,say 11 months .Complaints are frequent as to the delays, and as a rule, it takes the Department nearly tvt months to investigate and reply to a complaint.Complaint,-] would be even more frequent, were it not for the  fact that Local Committees make advances to the claimant equal to or frequently exceeding the pension he Is claiming; tho delay,often means more money for the claimant, and. if the award is less thanthe temporary allowance this causes great dissatisfaction-tion.Hitherto the payments made by Local Coiamittees havenot been audited except in rare cases.   The policy has been not to enquire too closely into the payments made by  Local Committees, even when it has been suspectedthat the payments are beyond the regulations.     At&apos;  present about  16,000,000 a year is beingdisbursed by Local Committees without regulation audit.Pensions are assessed by a Department which doesnot see  the man.     The Report of the man&apos;s Medical Board is sent &apos;to the Department and officers - in two Branchesladies - award a pension on the medical findings.These officers in certain circumstances may refer thereport for a Doctor5 s advice upon the Board1s report.The Doctors do, in fact, in about half the casesreferred to them, vary the Board&apos; s findings and eitherincrease or reduce the pension; these Doctors have neverseen the patient    the pensioner.If when  the pension is granted the man is dissatisfied with the amount, he can obtain a review through hisLocal Committee by a Medical Referee, and if themedical  Referee, so advises, the Local Committee can make advances in excess of the Pension granted.   TheMedical  net oree1s report is sent to London, for the man apapers to be attached and sent *o another medical board and action then proceeds as in  (8).   It has happened that one man has had 6 Boards and 3examinations by Medical Referees in 3-1 months,&apos; and all this for a temporary pension,Very row permanent pensions Lave yet been granted; theyare chiefly temporary and  subject to renewal.   I donot believe that men will be satisfied to have their permanent pensions settled without some form of hearingor trial at which they are present.
Advantages.Medical      The Ministry of Pensions is taking over the medical staff of the Ministry of National Service, and will shortly take ever from the War Office Hospitals throughout the United kingdom.       The medical organisation of the Ministry  of Pensions, though controlled from London, must necessarily be decentralised in action, as the Doctor must go to the pensioner or claimant.       It is proposed to.continue with but slight variations the system of regions set up by the Ministry of national Service, and to place in charge of the medical work in each Region a Commissioner of Medical Service with medical staff and inspectors etc.       The medical service will&apos;thus require Headquarters in 13 Regions and accommodation for Medical Boards, staff etc.       The Local Committees will be in communication with the local Regional Headquarters in matters of medical treatment and training under medical advice and for medical Boards and Referees instead of applying to London as at present. General Administration.       It is proposed to set up Regional organisation for general administrative  purposes also in the 13 Regions.      In each Region there vail be      (a) A Director responsible for the administration of his          Region&apos;and advised by an Advisory  Council for the          Region, -      (b) Regional Advisory Council. - To  be composed of          Representatives of the Principal war Pensions Committee          within the Regions, for the purpose of guiding and          advising the Director in matters affecting Local          Administration.   This would provide a means for          consideration  of the difficulties  confronting the          disabled community by the Local  Authorities and the          Ministry in  conference on the spot.    Considerable          economy of time would be effected  at Ministry          Headquarters by this  arrangement and it would also          avoid the continual  stream of Deputations from          Local Committees from all parts  of great Britain          on matters which should be settled locally.  It          will  involve no appreciable expense to  Public Funds             The Regional Office will be divided.1-^          (1)   An Awards Branch.                                    v          .(2)   A Finance and Audit Branch.          (3)   A medical Services Branch.         &apos; (.4)   An Awards Tribunal          (5)   Local  Committee&apos;s Branch.
          Two classes of awards, viz Article 9 and FinalAwards can never be satisfactorily made except after examination cf the claimant and after hearing local evidence.         Article 9 cases are those of men not discharged unfitbut who have the right at any time to come forward and claim that their suesequent illness is due to Army Service.         There are als: the claims for final pensions,   Ido not believe that men will be content to have these  claimssettled in their absence by officials they do not see  andspeak to.          Men will claim to be heard, the decentralisedsystem and the Regional Tribunals will make it possible tomeet this demand.          The decentralisation of awards will have GO  bedone gradually, but as soon as possible all Article 9  cases should&apos;be done locally, and also all alternative pensionclaims.          The Regional Award Tribunal would at first dealonly with cases of dispute as to whether a man was or was not entitled to a pension.          Bet later, and certainly as regards permanentpensions, the amount of the pension may be made subject to appeal to the Tribunal.          The Tribunal should be censtituted as follows&apos;:-      1.   President (who has legal qualification - Barrister                                   .or Solicitor)      2.   Members, cne. selected from the Advisory Council                                    of . the riegion.                                                     3,Advantages.          A strong Committee has reported in favour ofd e c e nt r a 1 i s a t i o n.          As regards awards, tho ideal is that a man claiminga pension should be able to go before some independent body,and having proved his case obtain a grant of pension.          The demand to male a &quot;Pension&quot; a &quot;Right&quot; enforceableagainst the State in a Law Court is one form of expression ofthe ideal.          The centralised system can never get near tc the1 d e a 1..          Delays are caused chiefly by lack of information which can only be obtained locally either from a Committee oran employer or an appro*/ed Society; these delays should bereduced by a proper supervision of local work from regional headquarters.
      3.          one ex-soIdler or one ex-sailor.      4. .         one medical assessor. -As to finance and audit, .          At present cash audits have been conducted partly by volunteers without charge locally, but there has been no regulation audit, and consequently considerable sumsare being paid away irregularly.          Audit arranged from Regional Headquarters would beless expensive than a centralised audit9 and can be used more readily as an administrative check,Cost of organization, .          The additional cost of the proposed regional organisation will not be considerable as many of the appointments to the administrative staffs will be made from existing- appointments which will fall vacant as the regional organisation is established..          I believe that the better administration; b ma&amp;epossible,&apos;will save staff and save part&apos;, at least, of thewrongful expenditure now made by the Local Coiiimitteesin excess of any additional cost, and it should alsospread greater content amongst the disabled.Author.lty required          I recommend that authority be given to set uporganisation such as I have sketched in the 13 Regionsand to obtain the necessary staff and accommodationforthwith,
