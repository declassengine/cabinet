The question of the Police Union has served to give prominence to a wider and more general problem, namely that of the recognition of trade unions and similar organisations,and the right to strike in public and public utility services in general;  and this involvesin reality a larger issue than might at first sight appear as a consequence of the  fact thatthe term &quot; public utility &quot; has a somewhat ambiguous significance.    Primarily, it connotes the services of water,  gas, electric light, public locomotion,transport and communications, and sanitation.  On these services  the continuous exis-tence of  the  community depends. But this  alone does not serve  to distinguish them from many other equally  or even more fundamental services, such as coal mining and railway transport, or  the supply of food  and milk.   The distinction between these two groups is that in normal times in this country, the former services are owned and adminis-tered, for the most part, though by no means wholly, by public authorities.  The secondstill belong to private enterprise.  No  attempt, however, can be made to differentiatecarefully  between public utility services which are publicly owned  and those which are   (C mi) 140  1/19 h &amp; 8
 not.  The strong tendency is in the  direction of public ownership.  In  so far as they are not so owned, they can hardly be treated in a different fashion from other private industries.  In  the last resort, the public authority can safeguard its interests in the case of a dispute by bringing them under public control, as it has, in fact, done during the war in  the case of all the services enumerated in the second group above.     The main difficulty in the treatment of the employees in public utility  services in the present stage is revealed bjr the fact that many of the disputes occurring have arisen over the question of the recognition of the union.  There are perhaps three main grounds upon which a policy of non-recognition might be defended.     (1) It might be held that at least  in all cases where the utility service was owned or administered by a municipal or State authority, conditions of service should not be determined by the ordinary method of the interplay of demand and supply. The service is not,  in the ordinary way,  a profit-making concern, and therefore Labour should not attempt to negotiate with a public authority, working in the public interest, by the same methods which it  would apply to a company whose interest it was to buy  Labour as cheaply and to  sell the product as dearly as possible.     Whatever force there may be in this contention, it is hardly now more than academic. The employees do not either in theory or in practice admit any limitation of their right to organise in defence of their interests as employees against a possible exploitation for the sake of the community in general.   As  a matter of fact, the postal employees have secured recognition for their Union;  many corporations now recognise the Municipal Employees or other similar Associations;  and the State in its administration of the railways and mines  has dealt directly with the  Unions.  Probably, as regards most branches of the service, there is  now no real disposition to resist on this ground the recognition of at least an organisation  of municipal employees.    (2) The second ground is  that these services are so essential to the maintenance of the national economy that no organisation which in any way imperils the continuity of the services should be permitted.   This, of course, raises a point of the  first importance. But it is clear that it does not justify in relation to public utility services, measures which are not adopted in relation to many other services which are not normally in this country under public control.   Eailwaymen, transport  workers, coal miners,  food producers or merchants, and other groups have it in  their power to bring just as serious a threat against the whole national life  as any group of public utility workers.  The policy of non-recog- nition  in these  cases is now  impossible ;  and  there appears to be no  good  reason for attempting  any  discrimination on  this ground against organisations of public utility employees.    There is, however, one feature in  this situation which deserves consideration.   It is the difficulty which has been experienced both by the various  Unions and by the authori- ties dealing with them in the matter  of the overlapping of the Unions.   Authorities are naturally reluctant that their employees engaged in essential services should be associated with employees in private  industry and therefore liable to be  called out in support of demands made  upon private  employers.  There is no easy  solution of  this difficulty, which is only one special case of the controversy in the trade union world itself between craft and industrial unionism.  On the other hand, it can hardly be contended that this is in itself a sufficient ground  for delay on the part of the authorities in recognising all properly constituted unions.   It is probable, indeed, that the progress now being made in the constitution of Joint Industrial  Councils in the four oi five branches of the muni- cipal services will help  to define more  clearly the relations of. these several unions to one another, and at the same time help towards the settlement of the vexed questions of recognition.    (3)  The third ground, which raises  probably the most difficult question of principle of all, is that urged against the  recognition particularly of the Policemen&apos;s Union and the Firemen&apos;s Union.   It is that the whole efficiency of the forces employed in such services owing to the special nature of the services performed  depends on the maintenance of a degree of discipline which is unnecessary in other cases.  It is  presumably on this ground  especially in view of the rather  ill-chosen remarks of the  leader of the, Union-that recognition to the Police and Prison Officers Union  has just been refused by the authorities. By this decision the problem  as regards the police force is at any rate  for the momentsettled ;  but in view of the fact that further difficulties in this connection  may  occur in the future, especially in view of the  general tendencies to be observed in the industrialworld, it may be pointed out that there are a number of ways of modifying formal recog-nition so as to render it liable to less  drastic consequences  than might otherwise be thecase.  In the first place organisations  of the employees in question might be formallyconfined to members of the force in question.  A precedent for such a limitation of the
 organisation exists in the policy of the Postmaster-General,  who has always refused to recognise unions including membership  external to the postal  service.   Secondly, since it is not organisation which  is so prejudicial to discipline as the open revolt involved in a strike, a claim may be made that strikes in these services should be made illegal.   Again a useful precedent exists in  the Munitions  of War Act.  When the supply of munitions became of vital importance the right to  strike was removed by  legislation, but the work- people were given in its place the right  to appeal to arbitration.  The strike was in fact replaced by compulsory arbitration, and machinery was therefore provided for the redress of grievances.  If, therefore, the right to strike is withdrawn from the services mentioned above, careful provision should concurrently be made for access to an arbitration tribunal whose findings would be made obligatory  on  both parties.   In this  connection  it may be noted that the rules of the National Union  of Police and Prison Officers contain a provision against the strike which was only broken in the last resort, and it seems therefore probable that the organisations would accept a scheme which provided them with the right to appeal to an independent tribunal whose findings would bind the controlling heads of the force concerned.     As has already been indicated, it is probable that general unrest over the question of recognition will diminish, at any rate comparatively, in the  future.  In effect, the main question has been determined.  There will certainly be inter-union difficulties, affecting the unions themselves and the unions in relation to  employers.  But  since the policy of the Ministry, as laid down in the efforts to create Joint Industrial Councils, has implied approval  of the claim for recognition, there is no reason to expect  that the  continued application of that policy will have any other result than of helping to establish and main- tain harmonious relations.    These considerations, however, may have served to bring out the special position which workers in these services occupy.  They are, in effect, civil servants, and they are civil servants who have it in their power ultimately to bring the whole life of the community to a standstill  in support of their  demands.  From  what has been said, it is clear that. it is the second feature rather than the first which may require that special measures should be taken in relation to the employees in these industries.  Confirmation of this conclusion is forthcoming from the fact that the attempts which have been made both in the  British Dominions and in foreign countries to devise special treatment for fundamental  services have, in practice,  covered most of  the basic services, whether these  have been publicly owned or not.  Thus, e.g., all the States  of Australia  impose some limitation on the right.to strike.  New South Wales applies special limitations to public utility employees, and to those engaged in the supply of milk, meat and coal.  A similar condition of things obtains in New Zealand, Canada, and the Transvaal (see Codes 6081 and 6603).  In Canada the. only discrimination which exists operates in the case of the railwaymen and coal miners, both of which groups are employed in privately-owned concerns.  Nine European countries put workers in public utility services on a different footing from workers in general industry, and in most cases the law covers workers in private industry as well  as workers under a public authority.    It seems reasonably clear, therefore, that in the treatment of disputes in public utility services, the fact that the State or the municipality happens to be the employer does not,in the first instance, greatly affect the situation.   It may be expected, also, that the princi-ples which the State or municipality applies to workers publicly  employed will be capableof application to all workers on basic industries, whether publicly employed or not.                     PART II.-DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.Training Department.     On the cessation of hostilities an opportunity arose for the Ministry of Labour to estab-lish a Training Department  which should continue, with the modifications arising fromchanged conditions, the work which had been done  by the Ministry of Munitions and bythe. Ministry of Pensions, and  in  addition inaugurate any new schemes necessitated bythe special requirements of demobilisation and resettlement.     The  main object in  view is  to prevent the  flooding of the labour market withunskilled workers, or with workers who had attained strictly limited skill at  repetitionwork in processes which were necessary only during the war.  It is in the national interest that the class usually described as general labourers should not be permitted to increaseindefinitely, and. facilities for industrial training are therefore being afforded to certainclasses of men, women and youths.    (C1711)                                                                A 2
      Training of Discharged and Disabled Soldiers. The industrial training of discharged and disabled men has been transferred from  the  Ministry of Pensions, except in the cases of men who are still receiving curative treatment.  It has been decided to adopt the areas of the Joint War Pensions Disablement Committees as the areas of the new Training Committees.  In each area a Divisional Director of Training assisted by an Administrative Sub-Committee is to be appointed.  Steps have been taken to make these appointments in several areas.  The education authorities have been approached, and in the majority of cases a representative Director of Education  will act as Divisional Director of Training in the area.      An appeal has been made to trade unions for their co-operation and advice in the work of the department.      The department expects to utilise for training purposes the machinery and premises of the Instructional Factories established by the Ministry of Munitions.      The department has received many applications for training from fit discharged men, many of whom are under 22 years of age and were not employed in any particular trade before the war.  The department has, therefore, applied to the Treasury for sanction to grant maintenance allowances to  discharged men who are recommended by a competent authority for full-time courses.      Training  of Women. A  special  Branch  has been  formed to deal with problems arising in connection with the training of women. Apprenticeships interrupted by War Service.     Youths who joined the Forces while serving a term of apprenticeship are now returning at ages and under conditions which demand an adult&apos;s wage.  These apprentices, however, have forgotten much that  they  had  learned,  and will  in  technical skill be no more forward than they were at the time their training was stopped,  though being older and more self-reliant they should be of greater value to an employer.  In the national interest these youths should be encouraged to complete their apprenticeships and become skilled workers.   The problem to be solved is, therefore,  the provision of the difference between the  amount of wages a returning apprentice may reasonably expect, and the amount that an employer can properly afford to pay.     A  scheme has  been-drawn up by  the department according to which the State will render this necessary financial assistance.     Training. The employer is to guarantee to provide such  training  as  will enable an apprentice  to  become a skilled workman.  This  training will take place  either  in the employees establishment or at a Technical Institution.  In completing an apprenticeship, the  period of training lost by service in His Majesty&apos;s Forces must be reduced by at  least one-third.     Payment by.the Employer. Up to the date of the termination of the original apprentice- ship, or until the apprentice reaches the age of 21 (whichever is the earlier), the employer is to pay the rate of wages which is paid in that trade and district to apprentices in the year which would  have been  reached if the  apprenticeship had not been interrupted. After that  date the employer is  to pay not  less than  five-twelfths of the prescribedjourneyman&apos;s rate for the first year and not less than six-twelfths for the second year.     Payments by the State-lhs State is to pay :      [a) A wages  allowance of one-third  of  the prescribed journeyman&apos;s rate.   This           allowance will not become payable until the termination of the original appren-           apprenticeship, or until the apprentice  has reached  the age  of 21 (whichever is the           earlier).  It will not be payable for  more than two years.               If the  period of apprenticeship  to be completed exceeds two years, the           amount payable by the State will, thereafter, be paid by the employer, making           the wage so paid up to not less than ten-twelfths of the prescribed journeyman&apos;s           rate.     (b) A maintenance allowance for apprentices who are receiving training in a Technical           Institution.     (c) A  fees allowance  to cover fees charged to  apprentices training at  a Technical           Institution.     The scheme has been submitted to  the Industrial Councils and other representative bodies of  various trades, and negotiations are  in progress.  The revision of certain otherparts of the scheme is also under consideration.  So soon as this is completed it is hopedthat full publicity will be given to schemes for a large number of trades.
                            PART III. PRESS  COMMENTS.                            (1)  Labour and Socialist Press.                                (A)-Peace Conference. League of Nations.     There is less comment in the Labour papers on the Peace Conference this week.  Mr. J.. Ramsay Macdonald, in theiC Labour Leader,&quot; enlarges on the resolution of the International Socialist Conference.   This resolution emphasises the following  points:  (1) That  the delegates to the League must be elected out of Parliaments of the various countries ;  (2) that it should abolish all standing armies, since these &quot; so-called safeguards &quot; are the very surest things to lead to a series of events which will make both alliances and wars inevitable;&quot; (3) the League should secure the prevention  of economic war by  the establishment of Free Trade; and (4) it should have powers enabling it to develop into an organ for controlling production and  distribution of foodstuffs and raw materials throughout the world.  An earnest appeal is made to the I.L.P. to concentrate for the moment  upon  an effort to strengthen the hands of President Wilson on his return to Paris.     The &quot; Herald &quot; suspects that the Peace Conference is trying to evade President Wilson&apos;s fourteen points, and the proof of this &quot; lies in the very fact that they are afraid to make the peace.&quot;  For example,  the paper alleges that  anyone could lay down the territorial clauses of the Treaty on a just basis in a week;  on an unjust, land-grabbing basis it is bound to take several months.     Mr. H. M. Hyndman, in C! Justice,&quot; attacks President Wilson&apos;s scheme as a succession of omissions when difficulties are to be encountered.  He believes  that  it is impossible to &quot; rush through &quot; safely a world-wide arrangement such  as the League of Nations, and believes with Senator Lodge that peace might be concluded first, and that it would have already been concluded but for the interminable discussions on the League.                                (B) Foreign Affairs. Russia.     Both &quot; Forward&quot; and  &quot;Justice&quot; contain articles expressing hostility towards Bol- bolshevism.  &quot; Forward&apos;&apos; warns&apos;&apos; those who j ump so readily after every promise of a short cut to the millennium &quot; against Bolshevism as expounded by  Lenin, whose  words are quoted. &quot; Justice &quot; believes that Mr. Keeling&apos;s description of Russia in the &quot; Westminster Gazette &quot; reveals the true state of affairs.   The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; continues to defend the Bolsheviks,  and the &quot; Call &quot; points out that while the Press prints harrowing  accounts of starvation by the Bolsheviks, the Allies are responsible for the  awful suffering in Russia and  Germany.                                 (C) Home Affairs. The Coal Commission.    An account of the proceedings of the Coal Commission appears in most of the papers,, where Robert Smillie&apos;s utterances are given special prominence.     The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; thinks it may well be that these proceedings herald the dawn of a  new industrial era.  If  Capitalism in Coal is dethroned, then Capitalism in Railways and  Canals  cannot long outlast it.  &quot; Forward &quot; adds, however, that this will probably be the last public Commission this side of Socialism, since it is unlikely that Capitalism will ever again risk such another public bout with the champions of democracy.    The ec British Citizen &quot;  appears to be certain that the miners&apos; demands will increasethe cost of coal, and so the cost  of living all round.   &quot; On these  matters Smillie has  no comment to offer, and he uses the perfectly legitimate demand for better houses to coverhis silence when confronted with facts and figures as to  the effect  of the  increased coal prices on trade.&quot;  The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; on the other hand, believes that the case &quot;againstthe miners&apos;  demands has been completely shattered  by the evidence of the  officials and owners themselves.    The two papers which dare to prophesy as to the results of the Commission are nothopeful from the miners&apos; point of view.  The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; the South Wales I.L.P.organ, fears that concessions will be granted to the owners by means of increased produc-tion  and scientific management, which would obviously defeat the purpose of the miners    (C 1711)                                                               A 3
   in pressing their demands ;  while the &quot; Call &quot; expects that the Commission will probably   result in some arrangement whereby the miners are granted a little on condition that they   leave a lot to the owners.   Labour Unrest.       Mr. Ramsay Macdonald,  in &quot; Forward,&quot; blames the Government for  its  shifting   attitude to Labour.   First threatening, as at the opening of Parliament, then conciliating,   as at the  Industrial Conference.  If that Conference would begin its work by passing a   vote of censure on the Government and demanding another one, it is thought that Labour   would thereby be made to feel that they were at least getting to business.  According to   the &quot; Herald,&quot; the workers, faced with a hostile Parliament, have rallied on the industrial   field :  the blame for &quot; industrial unrest lies entirely with those who have promised but not   performed.&quot;   Conscription.       The I.L.P. papers  and  the &quot; Call &quot; bitterly oppose Conscription.  Both the &quot; Labour   Leader &quot; and  the &quot; Call&quot; deny that the Government proposals can be temporary, and   assert that the proposed Conscription will be extended after fourteen months, for whatever   need there may be for Conscription at present, it will certainly not be removed in May of   next year.  The Government proposals are said to prove an earlier statement in the &quot; Call &quot;   that the exigencies  of the war were a pretext, and not a reason, for the introduction of   Conscription.  The  &quot; Herald &quot;  declares that &quot; in all  the shameful annals  of  political   duplicity,  nothing has been so shameful as the present Governments giving and breaking   of the pledges over Conscription.&quot;  The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; supports this view, and further   remarks that we were told that Germany was going to pay for the war, and now it appears   we are to  start getting that-payment by making our own expenditure on war five  times   what  it was.  In the opinion of the  &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  the incidence  of the proposal is   very unfair, as those who  have had the good fortune to be demobilised will not come under   its operation.  The  men  who are going to be affected by it,  however,  are really entitled   to little sympathy, since three-quarters of the soldiers who voted supported the Coalition   candidates.       The &quot; British Citizen,&quot;  on the other hand, declares that Labour is raising a Conscrip-   tion &quot;bogey,&quot; and maintains that the idea of the Government wishing to retain Conscrip-   tion a day longer than  is  necessary is too absurd to be credited.  &quot; Justice &quot; advocates a   citizen army, and it urges the Labour Party to take up the matter.  With regard;to the   Government proposals it is thought that the Government should have declared the necessity   for the proposed extension of military service soon after the signing of the armistice.   Government Estimates of Expenditure.       Mr. Philip Snowden, in an article in the &quot; Herald &quot; entitled &quot; Rattling to Ruin,&quot;   severely criticises the Civil  Service estimates, the Bread Subsidy &quot; which is protection   pure  and simple &quot; and especially the Army  and Navy estimates, which, he  states, are   obviously intended to be of a permanent nature ; these latter &quot; are the crowning justifica-   tion of the action of those who  condemned the continuation of the war.&quot;  He anticipates   that the method of  meeting these estimates will be by loans, and states that the honest,   policy would be either to  consolidate the war  loans at a much lower rate of interest (this   would be justified because a great part of the loan is fictitious, and the rest mainly repre-   sents war profits which  ought never to have been made), or to change the policy in regard   to Foreign relations, which is responsible for such colossal expenditure a policy  which is   also advocated by the &quot; Call.&quot;   Conscientious Objectors.      There is a renewed agitation in the Labour papers  for the release of Conscientious   Objectors.   The &quot; Herald &quot;  and the &quot; Call&quot; urge the Labour movement to make a  more   spirited plea for their release, and they cite the example  of the Sinn Fein prisoners, who   have been freed only because a handful of Irish people has succeeded by sheer persistency   in compelling the British Government to do so.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; gives the examples   of America and Italy,  which have already  released their Conscientious  Objectors and   political prisoners.   &quot; That  this country, with its traditions of Liberty, should refuse to   do the  same is an illustration of how low we have sunk in public morality during the last   five years.&quot;  &quot; Forward &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; contain articles by Conscien-   tious Ob j ectors complaining bitterly of the treatment meted out to them.   In the &quot; Workers&apos;   Dreadnought &quot; special reference is made to forcible feeding and re-arrests.
 Nationalisation.     Sir Leo Chiozza Money in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and Mr. F. W. Jowett in the &quot; Brad- ford Pioneer,&quot; write strongly in favour of nationalisation, illustrating their arguments from a record of the national factories.  Thus, Sir Leo states that one national factory built by the State was so well equipped  that it sold for more than it cost, while  it is poiuted out in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot;  that the munition factories were started in 1915 because private enterprise Lad failed. Pledges to Trade Unions.     The &quot; Herald &quot; reports that last week the new draft of the Bill for the Restoration of Trade Union Conditions was withdrawn, and draws the conclusion that the Government/will continue promising to make  legally binding the restoration of trade union conditions, but will never actually do it.                (2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement. Army Service Transport Corps.    &apos;The &quot;Globe&quot;  (11th March) points to the &quot;hide-bound  official  stupidity&quot;  of the demobilisation  methods of  the Transport Corps.  Cases are recorded in which men who are particularly wanted by employers remain in this corps though application has been made for them.  The men themselves say &quot; the  work we are doing is just joy-riding aboutthe country.&quot; Position of &quot; Derby &quot; Men.    A  correspondent to the &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (12th March) contends that Derbymen are being unfairly treated  under the present  demobilisation system.  They wererecruited in 1915, received a day&apos;s pay on attesting, and to all intents and purposes werein the  Army in 1915.   &quot; Yet the War Office is keeping thousands of these men in theArmy on the plea  of a  quibble that they were not  called to the colours until after the 1st January, 1916.&quot; Temporary Civil Servants (Women).    According to the &quot;Morning  Post&quot; (17th  March) a good deal of dissatisfaction existsamong women  employed in Government offices at  the  methods of demobilisation thatare pursued.  It is alleged that those who are not dependent on their earnings are oftenretained, while  those who have to earn their  living are dismissed.                PART IV.-GENERAL TOPICS AND DISTRICT REPORTS.                                    (1) General.Forthcoming Labour  Gatherings.    It is reported that a meeting of  the International Federation of Trade Unions is tomeet at Amsterdam  at an early date.    The Parliamentary  Committee  of the  Trade  Union  Congress  and the  national executive  of  the Labour Party  have jointly decided to convoke  a National LabourConference to consider the situation in regard to the League of Nations.   The conference is to be held in London on the 3rd  April.    At the annual conference of the Independent Labour Party to be held at Huddersfieldon the 20th-22nd April, the following  resolutions will be among those discussed: (1) Onetabled by the National Administrative Council on national finance advocating an equitablesystem of conscription of wealth, and a national banking system ; (2) resolutions in favourof nationalisation of land and industry and protesting against the sale of national factories and ships;  (3)  several  calling for the  abolition  of  Conscription and the release ofConscientious Objectors.
 Workers&apos; Demands,     The Triple Alliance.-Hhe Coal Commission is due to report on the 20th March.  A special delegate meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen was held on the 14th March to consider the offer of the railway companies ;  the meeting rejected not only the proposals but  also the principle on which they were based, and intimated a refusal to compromise on the national programme.   Mr. J. H. Thomas stated after the meeting that the decision had created a serious situation;  difficulties also having arisen from the fact that the whole of the Union membership had not been included, and that the Triple Alliance are called to meet as early as Friday, 21st March.  On Wednesday, 19th March,  Mr.  J. H. Thomas flew over to Paris to consult with Mr.  Lloyd George on the situation.     On Wednesday,  19th March, a special conference of the Transport Workers&apos;  Federation is to receive the result of the reference to the branches at the various ports  of the employers&apos; offer on the 44-hour week.  On Friday, 21st March, the  Triple Alliance meets to discuss the decisions of its members.     Police. In the police orders issued on the 17th March it  was notified that the War Cabinet on the 13th March  &quot; decided that recognition could not be given to  the Police Union.&quot;  The Police interpreted the Prime Ministers statement after the recent strike to mean that the Union should not be recognised during the war. In consequence of  their desire to secure recognition, no effort is being made to set the  new Representative Board working, which is due to be established by the 1st  April. The sergeants and  constables decline  to make a sufficient  number of  nominations for the boards representing  their grades,  so that it appears unlikely that elections for these two boards will be able to be held.  The Police Union is protesting against the alleged recent endeavours to introduce military methods in the Metropolitan Force, and demand  a full impartial inquiry into the whole question.  A further complication has arisen since the Police Union has affiliated itself to other  labour organisations.     Postal Workers. Two mass meetings of Postal Workers were held in  London on the 16th March at which the following  resolutions were passed : (1) That the  Postmen&apos;s Federation and the  Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos;  Association should be amalgamated; (2) to support the scheme of the National Joint Committee of Post Office Associations for increased wages, shorter hours and abolition of split attendances ;  (3) to protest against the inaction of the Postmaster-General in applying the Whitley Scheme to the Post Office. It was said by one speaker that the Postal Workers aimed at amalgamating ultimately with the Triple Alliance.     Civil Servants. A mass meeting of Permanent Civil Servants was held on the  14th March in support of  their  claim for the application  of the Whitley scheme to the clerical and administrative departments of  the Civil Service.Demands for Reduced Hours.    It is reported that the  Engineering  and Shipbuilding Trades&apos;  Federation intends togive  notice for a reduction of the working hours to  44 a week.    Male night telephonists and call office attendants are  demanding a reduction of hoursfrom 54 to 42 a week.    The Gas Workers are reported to have rejected the employers&apos; offer of a 48-hour weekand  are determined to adhere to their  original claim for  a 44-hour  week;  and  unless asettlement is effected within the  next fortnight they are resolved to take a ballot on the question of a strike. Joint Industrial Councils.     Baking. On the 5th March,  the  General Purposes Committee met and passed aresolution calling on the Ministry of Labour, in the event of the  withdrawal of the 12 hours old bread clause, to secure its immediate substitution by  an order prohibiting night work between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.   It was announced in the &quot; Times &quot; on the 15th March, that the 12-hour clause  will shortly be removed.     Furniture. The question of the length of the working week has created a very criticalposition in this industry, and if no agreement is reached the Industrial Council may dissolve.A meeting of the Council is being held on the 28th March.
                              (1) DISTRICT REPORTS.London and South-Eastern.    Employment. Unemployment is reported throughout London as &quot; extremely serious.&quot;It is urged that propaganda work should be undertaken to inspire confidence in employerswilling to put new  work in hand.  At Shepherd&apos;s Bush, Messrs. Waring &amp; Gillow are continually discharging workers who have been engaged.on war contracts at the WhiteCity.  The difficulty of resettling these workers  is reported  to be  increased by theretention of pivotal men in the Army.South Midlands and Eastern.    Employment. Unemployment is not considered serious in this area.  The gloveindustry is expanding to absorb women workers at Whitbury, Charlbury and Woodstock.At Grays (Essex) a margarine factory has already given employment to about half thewomen drawing unemployment donation.   .                               ..West Midlands.    Dilutees. Some local unions complain that dilutees are not being discharged in the birmingham  area, and  that  certain  firms are retaining  women instead of employingdischarged soldiers.Yorkshire and East Midlands.    Employment. Unemployment is increasing at Sheffield.  Donation  is being paid toabout 20,000  workers, and for the first time, the number of men is greater than that ofwomen.  Messrs. Vickers and  Messrs. Hadfield have issued notices that, owing to shortageof coal, they are unable to guarantee employment after the 22nd March, but that the mencan remain at work on a day to day contract, so long as coal supplies continue.    Effect of Shorter Hows.-Messrs. Harrison &amp; Co., Ltd.,  ironworkers, Lincoln, estimate that the effect of  the 47-hour  week has been to reduce output by 100 tons per month.    Women Dilutees. A dilution dispute has occurred at the  works of Messrs. Smith,Barker &amp; Willson of Halifax, where members of the A.S.E. and the  United  Machine -Workers&apos; Association have withdrawn their labour because of the refusal of the firm to dismiss its women workers.  The firm intend to make the factory one for women&apos;s  workonly, and refuse to reverse  their policy except under legal compulsion.    Building Trade Hours. An agreement has been drawn up between the Master Builders&apos;Association and the Building  Trades Council at Nottingham to introduce a 44-hour  week to begin at once.North-Western.    Employment.-Unemployment is  still very serious in Lancashire and Cheshire.   Forthe week ending the 8th March, 211,668 persons in the  two counties received unemploy-ment donation, an increase of 8,000 on the previous week&apos;s figures, and double those ofthe opening days  of the year.   More than half of the number consists of  women and girls.The distribution  by industries shows that one-third of the unemployed are  in textilemanufactures, 36,000 are engineers, shipbuilders or metal workers, 11,500 in the chemical industry, 2,100 miners, and 6,000 in the building trades.  It is feared that, at the current rate of demobilisation, the labour market may soon have to .deal with several hundred thousand more men.Northern.    The Coal Commission. In the Northern mining area, interest in the  Coal commission is directed mainly to the question of the royalties and to the 2s. 6d. advance in the priceof coal, which, from the miners&apos; point of view, enabled the coalowners to &quot; pocket fivemillion pounds.&quot;     Ways and Communications Bill. Organisations which have riverside and  harbourinterests appear to be opposed to the Ways and Communications  Bill.   Meetings of protest against it have been held by the River Wear Commission, the Newcastle Chamberof Commerce, and the Tyne Improvement Commission.
     Employment. Employment  generally lias  improved since  the boilermakers&apos;  strike came to an end.     Unrest (Electricians). Unrest is still  active, and  meetings have  been held by the Electrical Trades Union at Sunderland, South Shields  and Newcastle, to demand higher pay and shorter hours.  Failing satisfaction, the union threatens a strike. Wales.     Coal Conciliation Board.- The Dowlais strike has been made the occasion of a  cam- paign against the  Coal  Conciliation  Board, which is described in a  leaflet issued by the Strike Committee,  as &quot; futile, untrustworthy and .  .  . farcical.&quot;     Building Trade Wages -Building trade  operatives are dissatisfied  with the action of the Ministry of Labour in merging the 12  per cent, bonus in the  wage rates settled by the local Joint Council on  the 17th  December.   There are threats of a  strike which may affect all the steel&apos;and tinplate workers in the area.     Alien Labour  on British Ships. The agitation  against the employment of aliens on British vessels continues.   A raid was made on  a steamer of the Blue  Star line, with the result that the Chinese employed on it were paid off and a British crew was signed on.     Conscription. Anti-conscription meetings have been held in the  South Wales  coal- field, and resolutions passed calling for a conference to consider any necessary action. Scotland.     Employment. Unemployment among  women is occupying attention.   The Scottish Divisional Council  of local Advisory Committees has suggested  that,  to assist reabsorp- tion in  industry,  women  in  receipt  of out-of-work donation  should be  permitted to undergo training under approved schemes, without being disqualified for  receipt of the donation.     Unemployment is most acute on the  Clyde and in the jute and  flax  towns of the east coast.  In Dundee in  1913, the cost of making a ton of jute into cloth  or  sacks was  6 above the Calcutta cost; the difference has now risen to  24.   On the other hand, the Tweedside hosiery industry seems  to be reviving, and there are vacancies for a large number of girls in the Ha wick mills.     Housing. Complaints of  house  scarcity are constant  in the  centres  of  industrial unrest.   It is estimated that 50,000 houses are  required for Glasgow alone, and deputa- tions of building trade operatives have been interviewing local authorities to urge them to accelerate  their housing schemes.   The Local Government  Board for  Scotland has sanctioned four  schemes,  but the serious shortage of  timber has limited contracts to60,000 doors and window frames.                                PART  V. DISPUTES.(a)  Involving a Stoppage of Work.           A local strike of  miners in the Nottinghamshire coalfields assumed serious proportions        on the 19th March, when about 38,000 members of the Nottinghamshire Miners&apos; Association        are reported to have ceased work.  Their demands include the substitution of shovels for forks        for filling coal, a new price list for main road workers and a flat rate of 8s. 3d. per day for all        workers in abnormal places.  The coal owners have already granted the men&apos;s demands for        the substitution of shovels for forks, but no agreement has yet been reached on  the  other        points.           The miners who have been on strike at Dowlais accepted the recommendations made  by        their  delegates who met the Coal Controller&apos;.5? representative and returned to work on the        18th March.           The strike at the  Ealeigh Cycle Works, Nottingham, was settled on the 17th March, the        men agreeing to resume work unconditionally the next day.           A strike of skilled engineers at a  Halifax firm over  the question of women dilutees is        referred to in Part IV.
(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.            It is reported that the South Wales Colliery Examiners&apos; Association, dissatisfied with the         Coal Controllers reply to their demand for a 30 per cent, increase in wages and reduction in         working hours, have decided to  cease work on  the 22nd March unless their demands were         conceded.            The municipal  employees in the Borough of Camberwell are reported to have handed in         notices to cease work on the 26th March if their demand that the war bonus shall be increased         to 30s. is not granted, or if the matter is not referred to the Ministry  of Labour.            As a result of negotiations with Mr. Justice Sankey, the threatened strike of the Colliery         Workers other than miners in consequence of their exclusion from the Coal Commission,         has been averted.  They have agreed to await the report of the Commission.            The Employment Exchange clerks in the South-Eastern division are agitating for improved         conditions of service.   At present they are willing to  accept arbitration, if this is offered by         the Employment  Department of  the Ministry of Labour, on all points except the demand for         an increase of wages.            Unrest over the dilutees in  the Birmingham area; over Asiatic labour on British ships         in the South Wales ports;  among  building trade operatives  in South Wales on a  wages         question ; and among electricians at Sunderland on questions of wages and hours are referred         to in Part IV.R.  S.  HORNE.
