Note &quot;by the Board of Trade;       &apos;ijhe following is an extract from the Minutoe  of the  War Cabinet held on Thursday, July 5th,  1917:-       4. tireless in merchant Ships.  The War Cabinet had  under consideration a paper by tho Admiralty (Paper  G.1.1238)  relative to i&amp;e fitting of Wireless  in merchant ships  during  the war and the continuance of its use by overseas merchant  ships of 1600 tons and over after the war *  It was pointed  out that two operators would be necessary during the war,  whereas one operator would suffice during conditions of peace.       The War Cabinet requested the Admiralty,  the  Board of  Trade and the Shipping Controller to confer together,  and  after deciding what was the best course  to adopt,  the Board  of Trade to promote a Bill if necessary to give effect  to  the  decision.     After consultation between the Departments  concerned itwas considered that a Bill should be introduced  to provide forthe compulsory fitting of merchant ship a of 16CC tons  gross  and upwards with wireless telegraphy after tha war.   Sir Albert  Stanlcommunicated with Mr. Bonar Law who agreed on August 16th, 1917,$hat in view of the decision of the War Cabinet it was unneoessarto trouble them again on the matter,  and  that a ooDmmunicationshould be sent to shipowners and to the Marconi  Company informing them that the Government would introduce a Bill  in due course.   v  Subsequently the Merchant Shipping Advisory Committee was asked to advise as to the exemptions which should be made underthis Bill, and they have made a report on this point.                                              $ha
     Ihe Bill is put forward&apos; on the following grounds  (1) as desirable generally for the safety of shipping;  (2) the Admiralty sre most anxious $hat as many merchant      ships as possible should be fitted with wireless      telegraphy as this has proved of such great service      during the war;  in particular it will enable the      Admiralty to take measures for the safety of all      merchant ships so fitted immediately on the outbreak^,      of war;  (3) it opens up to wireless operators the prospect of      permanent er^lo^mint;  (4) to redeem tho pledge given to the karconi Company with      the permission of the  Chancellor of the Exchequer.     Amendments will almost certainly be suggested in theBill by the ship owners representatives in the House;   but theBoard-of trade are informed  by the Chairman of the MerchantShipping Advisory Committee  that the Bill very fairly repre-sents the views cf the majority of the Committee  on the subjeot                                  BO/RD OF SHADE                                     5th April 1919.
