With  reference to  Minute 4  of the&apos; 8th  Meeting,  the                 Chairman announced that the support of the American Exchange                 had been withdrawn as from the 20th March.Controls not            2.  The Chairman referred to the letter that had been circu-already specifically   feted to  the effect that all  controls,  except those specificallydealt with.         retained,  would be automatically removed at the end of the month,                 unless a case were shown for their retention, and in that connection                 he said that a reply had been received from the Ministry of Food[1205]-445B
   setting out the principles that it had been decided should govern   the question of food controls.  He enquired whether the decisions   of the  Conference on import and export restrictions  were being   fully carried into effect.      Mr. Chapman replied that there  was a  Committee  sitting   and at work in regard to imports, and that the decisions of the   Conference were  being given full effect.  In regard to exports to   places outside  the blockade  area, Lord Emmott&apos;s Council were   making recommendations which were being adopted.      Lord Emmott  remarked that  he was quite satisfied that all   was being  done that could be done, but he pointed out that  in   the case, of raw cotton, the Treasury had raised difficulties, and   though the control of the American Exchange had gone, they were   still obdurate.      The Chairman pointed out that the decision in Minute 7&apos;(a)  of the 6th Meeting did not provide for Treasury objection having.   any effect,  and that the matter should  be raised at once with the   Chancellor  of the Exchequer.Publicity.     3. Mr. Chapman suggested that it should be announced thata list should be published of all controls that were being retainedand  stating that all other controls were abolished.     The Chairman said he proposed to have this done at the endof the.month, but that some special wording would be requiredin the case of food controls.Restrictions on exports to Placeswithin theBlockade Area.     4. Lord  Emmott submitted  the following resolution for  con- si deration:      That all  yarns, piece-goods, and other manufactures of cotton,          wool, jute,  and silk, be transferred  from the Prohibited          List to the Free List with the least possible delay, to          which be added  linen manufactures and rubber manu-          factures other than tyres.     Lord Emmott said that if it were not possible to have a cpm- plete Free List, he urged that at any rate, the proposed resolution should be adopted.   One of  the  main reasons for trade being in a state of stagnation was the  difficulties of the guarantee  and certificate system.   It was practically  impossible to  obtain these guarantees, and consequently the United Kingdom was in a very disadvantageous position  compared with other countries.   The only remedy for this was to put as many articles as possible on the Fre3  List.  He understood that one of the reasons  against  this proposal would be one of a purely military nature, but as against the military reasons for not relaxing the blockade, he desired to point  out that one of the  most  potent  weapons they would have if the blockade or part of the blockade were removed, would be the re imposition  of  the  blockade or the fear  of  it.   As  a matter of fact,  however, he was not asking for the complete removal of the blockade,  or for the  destruction of its machinery, but only, that It should be  partially raised.  It had already been partially raised in the case of food.  Another argument which he understood would be advanced  against his  resolution, was that if cotton  manu- factures were allowed through  the  blockade, the United  States would immediately want raw cotton to be allowed through, but those  who put forward  this  argument  seem- to  forget that  the raising of the blockade in  respect of raw cotton might well havea steadving effect on prices and so benefit rather than  injure  thecotton industry in this country, but in any event, it was not at allclear  that the&apos;United States&apos;would  take the  attitude suggested.
  Before the War the textile markets of the Northern Neutrals were  almost wholly British, but now the United States were exploiting  the markets, as they were in a position  to promise to fulfil new  orders, but this country was not, because  it could not complete the  old ones. He felt sure that the bulk  of the odium of the blockade  fell almost  entirely  upon   this  country,  particularly  having  regard  to  the  large  number  &apos; of  orders  which  had. been  placed here and paid for, and in respect of which  no delivery  had been made.  Lord Emmott quoted Dutch figures which had  been obtained by the War Trade Intelligence Department, and  from these figures he showed how the export of various articles  from this  country  to  Holland had  dropped, by reason of  the  embargo placed in October  1917, to practically nothing in  the  year 1918.  On the other hand Germany had kept up her export  trade as far as she could.   He felt that the very rigid  blockade  of manufactured goods as a weapon of war had not proved to be of  any great value.  He thought that this was proved by the figures:  he quoted, for it had really only succeeded in hampering our own  trade while, it had not intimidated the neutrals  concerned.   He  wondered whether the Foreign Office really felt that the military  reasons outweighed  the tremendous advantages that would accrue  to the  trade of this country and its morale if his  proposition were  accepted.      The Chairman enquired what the unemployment figures were  in the  cotton districts.      Mr. Chapman replied, speaking from memory, that there were  about  200,000 out of work in the north-west district, of whom  70,000 were cotton operatives.      Mr.  Ming worth said that the position in the West Riding was getting serious.     Mr. Harmsworth pointed out that he and his advisors were doing their utmost to preserve the blockade  and its machinery, and he believed they  had succeeded in keeping it intact, notwith- standing  the tremendous  pressure that had been  brought to bear upon it.  He did not think that Lord Emmott&apos;s  argument could prevail.  If manufactured textile goods were allowed through the blockade  he understood  the  United  States would immediately demand that the same  freedom should be applied to raw cotton, and France and Italy to  raw  silk.  Both  these commodities were essential materials of War.  The  blockade was an instrument of war, the preservation of which, for the time being,  the very highest military  opinion,  including   Marshal Foch,  demanded.   The onslaught that had been made on the maintenance of the blockade had been tremendous.  There had been demands that such articles as nickel, glycerine and rubber be allowed through. These were all essential ingredients of munitions.  The United States were doing their utmost to break the blockade and for this reason it was all the more essential that this  country should not  in any way weaken it.  He thought that German opinion was  hardening and he understood it to  be  the  view that it might in certain eventualities be  necessary to  threaten  Germany  with  further hostilities,  or  with  a stiffening  of the  blockade.  If  matters pursued their normal course it was  quite possible that the blockade would be removed within a very short time and he thought that any good that might accrue from its immediate relaxation would, therefore, be infinitesimal. Mr. Harmsworth reminded the Con-ference, however, that the  Bolshevik disturbances in Europe might lead to  such eventualities as  would  make the retention  of theblockade,  with its machinery unimpaired, absolutely imperative,and, furthermore, if there were Bolshevik  disturbances in  central europe, the military argument for retaining the  blockade wouldbe all the more strengthened.
     The Chairman thought that  the various points  at issue re- quired to be considered separately. He asked Mr. Harmsworth if the machinery of the blockade would disappear when commodities of the class mentioned in Lord  Emniotf s motion which had been bought and paid for but not delivered, were  treated  as being on the Free List.     Mr. Harmsworth said  he did not think that such&apos; a  limited export would have  the effect of breaking the machinery.     The Chairman pointed out that it followed, therefore,  that the export  could be increased at any r^te up  to a point, without the machinery being broken.  He reminded  the  Conference  that so far as the feeling in this country was concerned, it was not a matter so much as to what was the reason for unemployment as to what the people of Lancashire  thought was the reason  for un- employment.  He asked if the Foreign Office would object to goods of the nature he had described,  which had been bought and paid for but not delivered, being allowed through the blockade.     Mr. Harmsworth said  that he,  personally, had no objection whatever, but that it would be necessary to consult  the Allied Blockade Committee.     Lord Emmott  pointed  out that even if  his  resolution  were passed, very little would percolate into  Germany.     Mr. Harmsworth pointed out that on the one hand  it  was urged that  by passing this  resolution the unemployment problem in Lancashire would be greatly assisted, while on the  other hand, when the military reasons for maintaining the blockade were put forward,  it was urged that very  little would  percolate   into Germany.   He thought that we wanted  our goods to get  into Germany but that we fought shy of the words  &quot; direct trade,&quot; and were endeavouring  to  get  them into Germany  under disguise. He thought  there  would be many advantages in starting direct trade with Germany again.     Lord Emmott  said that he was of course&apos;only referring to goods that could be  used, for War purposes when he said1 that very little would percolate into Germany.     Mr. Wing worth  questioned the value of the blockade  as  a&apos; military weapon.   He thought perhaps the  Food Blockade  was useful, but that was already partially raised.   He felt  that a very strong case had been made in support of Lord emmott&apos;s motion.     Colonel A mery  said that it would be interesting to  know what percentage of these goods would percolate into Germany, and what percentage would be available for War purposes.  If this motion were adopted the trade of the country  would be greatly  helped and the country would be strengthened  for meeting any possible renewal of hostilities, and this  factor would  more  than balance any ill that  might accrue.  This was looking  at the matter in its very worst  aspect,  and he  felt  that there was  no doubt Lord emmott&apos;s motion should be  adopted.     The Chairman  said  in considering  this question  it  was necessary to balance two psychological factors, one was  the feeling of the country that, for some extraordinary reason,-the Govern-ment was preventing trade getting underway, and the other was the effect on German  opinion if we removed  the restrictionsagainst the  import  of these goods into  Germany.  In regard tothe latter point it was  open to argument as  to what  effect  that
removal  would have.  It might make German opinion think wewere softening,  or on  the other hand it might create fear ojf thereimposition of  restrictions.  His  own feeling was that it wagunwise to  adopt Lord Emmott&apos;s motion  particularly as it was hoped that the blockade would very soon be removed.  He thoughta  great  effort should  be  made, however, to  secure passage  to neutrals of goods, of trie class dealt with in Lord Emmott&apos;s motion,which have been ordered and paid for, but which had not yet been delivered.  It was a half-way -step that might well placate opinion in this country.  In  a very short time the whole question could bere considered and then they might be able to  see clearly what themain decision should be.  But in any event, even if they decidedthen to adopt  Lord Emmott&apos;s motion, it would be weeks  before itwould be in operation on account of the necessity of putting thematter before  the Higher Authorities.  His suggestion,  however,would not entail delay as he understood Mr. Harmsworth would put   it  before  the  Allied Blockade  Committee in  Londonimmediately.     Captain  Hotham  enquired  whether  there  would be anyrationing of  these  goods,  and  if supposing there  were  nine months&apos;  supplies in store  in this country for the neutrals-the ration would be affected.     Lord Emmott   thought it  would  hardly be necessary  to ration, as he understood there was not a full year&apos;s supply in store.     The Chairman  requested  Mr.  Chapman  to  submit figuresshowing  what proportion the total quantity  of these goods boreto a  full year&apos;s supply.     Mr.  Chapman thought  that the Chairman&apos;s suggestion as toremoving the  restriction on goods,  (of the class mentioned andwhich had been ordered and paid for) should be extended to goods which had  been  ordered before the embargo was  placed on their export in October, 1917, and in respect of which no payment hadbeen made.  If this were not done, as soon as the blockade waslifted a large  proportion of the latter orders would be cancelled.     It was decided *     (1.)  That all yarns, piece-goods and other manufactures  of           cotton, wool, linen, jute  and silk lying in stock in this          country in respect of which              (a.)  orders have at  any time been placed in this                     country by neutral countries and  payment                    . has been made,               (p.) orders were placed in this country by neutral                     countries before the embargo was put on                     their  export,  whether the goods have been                     paid for or not,          should be treated as if on the Free List.     (2.)  Mr.  Harmsworth  should  be responsible for submitting          the proposal to the Allied Blockade Committee with a          view  to  giving  practical  effect  to  this   decision          forthwith.      5. Mr. Black stated that the fundamental reason for the con- tinuance of the Eoad Stone Control was shortage of supplies.   In 1918, the output of road stone was 2,188,000 tons, whereas it was eidimated that the present requirements amounted to rather more tiiiiZL 5,000,000 tons.   There was  a similar shortage in  tarred     * Subsequently Captain Hotham stated that the Admiralty were unable to give tbeir assent to this decision until the figures to be submitted by Mr Chapman were available.45                                                     C
  materials.   The output in 1918 in this case being f million tons,  whereas the requirements were 1,800,0.00 tons.   In consequence  of the shortage of supply, it was necessary to control prices and  supervise distribution.   They feared the removal of  the  control  would be followed  by a considerable rise in  prices,  and  would  also  mean  that  supplies  would  not  be available  where they  were most  required.   The roads of this country had  suffered  most  in districts  which  had  been  occupied  principally  by  troops,  namely,  counties  south-east of  a line drawn from the  Wash  through  Salisbury,  whereas supplies of  granite and  other hard  materials used in road making were mainly obtained  in Wales,  the  North  Midlands  and  the West  of&quot; England.  Prior  to  the war,  the  southern  counties  of  England had  been  mainly dependent upon the Channel Islands for supplies.  War conditions had interfered with  supplies being brought over  from&apos; the Channel  Islands during  the war  and  now the  high.  freight  charges  prevented supplies  being obtained  from  the  Channel Islands.  Mr. Black said that as regards facilities for  rail transport, the  Committee had  at  its disposal only  11,000  wagons,  whereas  it  was considered that  37,000 wagons were re-  quired for the proper transport and distribution of supplies by  land.  He believed that approximately  1\ million  tons of  road  making  material  was  imported  from  other  countries,  such as  Germany, France and Belgium before  the war.     Mr.  Killick  stated with regard to the question of imported  material a suggestion had been made that boats should be placed at  the disposal  of the Road Board, who should purchase granite f .o.b.  Channel  Islands for use in  the south-eastern counties of England.  This proposal had conditionally been approved of by the Treasury, but the -shipping facilities at present available were limited.   The result of freedom of control of shipping had resulted in ship-owners taking the most  remunerative routes,  to the detriment of the Channel Island granite trade     Mr. Killick stated that the Committee had, after careful con- sideration of the  whole question a month ago, come to the  con- elusion that  it was -most  desirable that  the  control  should be continued for at  least  three months  more, pending the arrange- ments for allocation  of supplies for this season&apos;s work.  He felt that the Government ought to help Local Authorities to make the necessary arrangements to obtain the  stone where  it was wanted to  make good the  damage done by the Military.  He urged that the removal of the control should at least be postponed for a month I to  enable the contemplated allocations for the year to be carried I into effect.                                                    j     Mr. Chapman thought that whereas the control had unques- 1 tionably been necessary during the  war,  it was  now no longer I necessary.   It  was,  in  fact, undesirable,  inasmuch  as it  meant that the Control Board stood between the producer and the con-1 sumer and was frequently a hindrance to both.  He urged that the E way to increase supply was to let the trade alone&apos;and allow private! enterprise to look after itself.   The Control Committee did the I work as well as it was possible for any Committee to do it,  but I mistakes were bound to occur, with the result  that employment I was limited.   He  added that if the control were to be abolished, it ought to be abolished before the allocations for next year were I made, as otherwise they would not merely be leaving the industry Ifree.                                                          j     The Chairman said that, as in all controls,  the psychological Ifactor had to be borne in mind when considering the question of Icontinuing the control.   There  was bound to be a  period of un-certainty while the trade was finding its own feet after resting I
upon Government support.  He realised that during this periodsome local  inconvenience might be caused, but  he did  not thinkthat there  was any danger of disastrous consequences, and hethought that the risk might as well be faced at the present momentas at the end of one or two months&apos; time.   He added that as thecontrol  6f  the Board originated in a Defence of the RealmRegulation, it might be necessary for a general licence to be issuedas a temporary measure until the necessary steps could be taken for the Regulation to be revoked.    It was decided&apos;that:     The Road  Stone Control should be discontinued with effect        from the 31st March,  1919.    6. It was decided that:     The Control of Cement should be rescinded as from the 31st        March, 1919.                                     (Initialled)   A. C.
