KiOTUOTIC&apos;1 S0Hji&apos;t;g, IHiiliATTO.&amp;[ HAi           prepared  in oomollanoe with Chief f3eorotaryFB       -             Minute of 17th March, 1917,look ended 19th March, 1919,                    The following is  a brief  statement  on  the work  ofthe Department  during the past  week in furtherance  of increased FoodProduction in ireland-                 &apos;  LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS,                     The number of applications received during thepast week is 27^and the total value of machinery ordered from thebeginning of the oresent year,  to date, under tho Scheme,  amounts  to 12,554/&apos;                      TILLAGE   SECTION.                     In the case of a large holding,  comprising landsin Qcunties Dublin and Heath, the occupier of which,  in tho opinion ofthe Department, failed without reasonable cause to cultivate in theyear 1918 the area required by the Tillage Order applying  to the hold-ing in that year.,,  the Department this week served notico  of their intention to make a certificate of default under which  tho occupierwill become liable to pay &quot;by way of penalty a sum of  801.  5a,of                     In oxercise  of  their  powers  under  the defence the Realm Regulations,  the Department  have authorised the ListowelRural District Council, acting on behalf of the Department,  toarrange for the cultivation of certain lands near Ballybunion..  Theselands wore entored upon by tho Department  in 1917,  by roaoon of thofailure of the person then claiming  to bo  the occupier  to take thonecessary steps to comply in that yoar with Regulation  PP of theDefence of the Realm Regulations, and  were cultivated in 1917 and1910 by local persons selected by the  Listowel Rural District Councilin accordance with the terms of Authorisations issued by the Depart-merit in those years.  Before authorising the Council to cultivatethe lands again in 1919, the Department approached tho  person whoclaims to bo tho occupier of tho lands, with a view to  affording  himan opportunity of carrying out the cultivation required under thoPillage (Ireland) General Order,  1919, in respect of the lands  inquestion.   The Department&apos;s action in authorising the  Council  tcoultivato. the lands in 1919 is consequent upon the failuro  to obtain,from the person who claims to be tho occupier, an undertaking that  hewould arrange for thoir cultivation,                      PROGRESS OF FARM WORK.                      During the week tho weather in the northern partlef the country wa3 generally very favourable for farming operations.[In the 8tuth, however, conditions were net  so satisfactory,  thejground in many places being too wet for ploughing or sowing.  Tho
planting of main crfrp potatoes and the sowing of oats have commenced ona small  ooalo in some districts, and, as much ground is now ready forseeding, it is expected that considerable progress will he made withthis work next week if tho weather conditions permit,  Some sowing ofspring wheat Is still being carried out.            The difficulties in regard to labour appear in severalparts of tho country to be becoming xk  somewhat less acute.              l                        F   L  &apos; A   X,Flax  Grading,     The  reports received from  tho Department1sInspectors and Flax  Instructors  indicate  that flax  is now being  gradedto a  standard comparable  to  that adopted  in  November and December  last,and. that  the dissatisfaction -that  prevailed,  among farmers has notbeen  considerably  allayed.Flax  Seed (Ireland)  Order, 1918. The  operations connected with the sav-ing   off lax s&quot;oed&quot;*are  now drawing  to  a close, and the Department have arranged  to dispense with the  services of the staff of  Inspectors  whoworo  appointed for the purpose  of  ensuring that the terras of  this order wore carried cut by flax  growers,   Owing  to the bad. weatherwhich prevailed  last harvest,  it is improbable  that mere  than 25$  to33$ of the seed  saved  will be  suitable for sowing purposes.Flax  Growing in  1919a   The reports received by  the  Department  indicateThaTTlhere is  likely to be a decrease of  about  25$  in  the area  sownunder flax this  year as compared with that sown in  1918.  The demandscf farm workers  for  increased wages are  causing farmers to  consider the advisability  of  sowing, instead of flax,  other  crops which  require less  manual  labour,,Demand for Flax  Seed.  The demand for flaxseed by  farmers is still  veryslow.Supplies of Flaxseed.     The supply of flaxseed that has now bee - obtained is  likely tc be in excess of requirements  for thin seasc Canadian (fibre) soed is, on the whole,  of a satisfactory standan &apos;)f quality, but some of  it has been insufficiently cleaned, and shows relatively low rate  of germination.  The quality of tho Dutch seed that  has  arrived is  good.   The , nglish seed in xKxSasJaxa of a variable quality, from poor to medium, and  serious difficulty is being experienced in getting farmers to purchase  this seed,  owing to  the fact that  some English seed imported last season proved to be a &quot;seed&quot; and not a &quot;fibro&quot; variety,                     LiAINTKHAHCL; OP LIVh STOCK-                     -............&quot; -.......- ......11&quot;&quot;&quot; T11,11..........&quot;......-*&quot;&quot;                 During the  period frtia 11th to 17th instant, inclusive,applications for  &quot;licences were  received  as followsJ-            To slaughter  or  export heifers............
