Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War and Air.             The only permanent establishment  at present   authorised for the Air Foroe is  that approved by the War   Cabinet in December 1917  (G.T. 2965) consisting of  2,000   officers and 25,000 N.C0&apos;s  and  men.             The numbers authorised  for the  Ai? Forces  of   Occupation are 6,500 officers and. 75,000 N.C*0*s and men*             The numbers proposed by the Air Council as the   peace  establishment of a  permanent Air Force of 102   squadrons, including 7 squadrons in India,  are approximately   5,500  officers and 55,000 N,C.0&apos;s and men.             As the proportion  of flying officers is two-   thirds of the total number,  it would be  impossible  to   absorb them all, as their period of flying  service  expires,   into the staff, technical and administrative branches of   the Force.j             I propose accordingly  that only 1,500 permanentI&apos;   Commissions be granted to Air Force officers.   The remain-   ing 4,000 officers will then hold temporary Air Force   Comissions and will ultimately  be transferred to the Reserve   or, In the case of officers  attached from the Army  and  Navy,   will revert to these Forces  respectively,                                 W. S. C,3/4/19.
