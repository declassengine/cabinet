REPORT relating to the Work of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for the week ending 9th April, 1919.

                                                                                                1. COMPULSORY ORDER UNDER DEFENCE of the REALM REGULATION 2.M.

In August 1818, on the representations of the Morayshire Agricultural Executive Committee the Board issued an order under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2.M. (1) (a) taking over the farm and lands of Marcassio. This action was taken in order that the Committee might be in a position to make adequate arrangements for the cultivation of the farm. It was subsequently found necessary to take over the implements of husbandry, machinery, stock, etc. on the farm, and an order for this purpose was accordingly issued under 2.M. (1) (b) in February 1919. The Committee ultimately reported that a satisfactory arrangement had been arrived at with the tenant for the future cultivation of the farm, whereby the Board would be relieved of all claims against them in respect of their period of occupancy. The Board have accordingly issued an intimation with-drawing their existing orders.



2. DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEES.

In connection with the cropping programme for 1919 the Board issued a circular letter to Committees in January asking that particulars as to the estimated area under cereal crops and potatoes should be furnished.

A reminder has been issued to those Committees who have not yet supplied the necessary information, urging them to do so as early as possible in order that complete returns may be available.



3. CORN PRODUCTION ACT, PART I. CLAIMS.

The Board have conferred with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland regarding the procedure to be followed in dealing with claims for payment under Part I. of the Corn Production Act, 1917, as modified by the decision of the War Cabinet announced on 1st instant. Draft Regulation dealing with this matter will shortly be submitted to Parliament, and the scheme proposed by the Board for checking the accuracy of Claimants&apos; statements of acreage are being laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.

                                                                                                4. EXPORT OF LIVE STOCK.

On Tuesday 8th instant the Board spent in conference representatives of the breeders of pedigree live stock of all kinds in Scotland to consider the proposal recently made by a Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Royal Agricultural Society of England that there should be continued in peace time, under the central of the Boards of Agriculture, the system of licencing all exports of live stock which has    
has been administered during the war by the War Trade Department.                                                        The oonference was unanimous in the opinion that, in accordance with the declaration made on behalf of the Government that all control necessary during war time should   be abandoned as soon as expedient after the declaration of peace, no case exists for continuing indefinitely this control on the export of live stock.                                           It was also urged that there need be no anxiety as to the possible depletion of British herds,  studs and flocks through abnormal foreign demands for pedigree breeding stock, as the greater  that demand the greater would be the stimulus to the breeding of pedigree stock to meet the demand.                                                                                    5. LAND SETTLEMENT for SOLDIERS and SAILORS.                                                     Under the Small Holding Colonies Acts the Board have received the approval of the Treasury to purchase the Estate of Gagio which is situated in Forfarshire and about 5 miles from the city of Dundee. The area of this Estate is 1324 acres and the present rental amounts to Â£2211. The Board will obtain cl? ontry to 512 acres at Martinmas 1919 and to the remainder of the farm area at ensuing terms. The land is of high quality and specially suitable for tho purposes of a Colony.
