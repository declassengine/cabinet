HIS DOOTTOT IS THE PROPERTY 01? HIS BRIT ATOP MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT) ,WAR CABINET.                     HYDE  PARK  WAR ^ SHRINE.1       (Memorandum by the First Commissioner gf Works.)I           -      Several questions in regard to the temporary War Shrine inHyde park have been addressed to me recently in the House ofCommons.  This shrine was erected by private subscription for a specific, occasion, namely. Remembrance Day, August 4th,  1918.Its present condition Is little les3 than an eyesore.  The flowersas they become dead are removed by the Park Staff, who also attendto the ground, but owing to the aoaroity if floxrers in the winter,they have greatly diminished in number since last summer.  Thereis no authority to maintain this shrine out of public funds,although the park Staff have received instructions to assist asmuch as possible.  There can be no doubt that  the present arrange-ment which is, of course, intended to be purely temporary, isvery unsatisfactory and quite unworthy of the  object of the shrinewhich is very unsuitable for the Park,  I am most strongly urged by the Bailiff of the parks to authorise the removal cf theshrine altogether.  As, however, such a step is likely to raise aconsiderable amount of public controversy,  I think it better thatI should receive the authority of the War Cabinet before taking any action.      The question of providing a permanent shrine is certain tobe raised in this connection.  I have had various offers from private individuals to do something in this direction, butI feel strongly that if it is decided to have  a permanent memorialof this ehara?ter, it should be carried out by the government through the officers of ay Department and at the expense of theGovernment.  I do not wish it, however, to be  understood that Iadvocate the erection of such a shrine&apos;in Hyde Park, my own view being that the whole question of a permanent war memorialrequires very careful consideration and should not be prejudiced by a pre^iure decision^ ,&apos;           t                        &quot; *      I would ask the War Cabinet to sanction the&apos; removal ofthe present temporary war shrine from Hyde Park. -I. attach areoent letteT r have&quot;&quot;reoeived from cne of the  pro^icrters of thewar shrine, Mr. CP. Higham, M.P.                              (Sgd.)  ALFRED MOND.S EC RET.G.T. 7Q36.YLMj, OFFICE 0? WORKS.   *  25th March, 1919.
mui&amp;m.                             22650,  Ludgate  Hill,       London.  March 18th,  1919.Dear Sir Alfred,                In regard to the War Shrine.  I  took  itthe position was this - hhat 3/00,  as the  commissioner of Works with the Bailiff of tne Royal  Parks  had assumed reeponsibility for the Shrine and  thatarrangements had been made with the  head  gardeners ofHyde Park to keep it in condition, pending  the  erection of the new Shrine which Mr. &quot;faring was  arranging for.I understand that Mr, Warjng&quot;e  offer still  holds good and I would, therefore,  appreciate it if  yon  would let me have permission, in corjunction with the ParkAuthorities, tc have the Shrine generally cleaned up andtouched up with paint where necessary and also  have newflags put on it,                I think that to hundreds  of thousands of people this spot in Hyde Park is  now a sacred place where they can go to regularly  to  lay a flower  and I-do not think it ought to be moved.                Do you agree for me  to -put  it intopresentable shape again?  I shall  look  forward  tohearing from you.                I am,                      Yours verv truly,                 (Sd)  CP. HICHAM.
