nt la the Pifp^erty1$MAR1919mMM  j^MQRAgDIM  FOR  THE  WAR  CAB DIET aHELIGOLANDThe possession of Heligoland by Germany donies freedomof movement to hoatile ships in the vicinity of her naval  ports and greatly increases tho difficulty of bombarding, blocking ormining operations against shipping in the Jade, Weser or Elbe,It also makes pursuit into the Sylt-Heligoland-Wangeroog areaextremely dangerous0   The artificial harbour forms a convenientand safe anchorage for vessels patrolling the Bight and has been used as an advanced base for submarine and torpedo boat flotillas4   Is     The-military value of Heligoland appears to lie mainly in its impregnable gun defences, and if these were destroyed the harbour works would be relatively unimportant.   Fortificationscanj however, be extemporised at comparatively short notice ifthe necessary arrange merits are made beforehand and this wouldprobably be done in the event of a future war.   If, however, thoharbour works wero destroyed, the difficulty of landing girts wouldbo greatly increased although it would still bo possible,   Tholevelling of the Island to high water mark which would be a com-parativoly simple engineering operation would bo the only certain.way of preventing its being used for military purposes in thefuture.   o.     From the military point of view, the return of the island to Great Britain is not considered sound policy, because&apos; its supplyand defence would be difficult and we might have to abandon it with consequent loss of prestige.   In peace time it might, however, be valuable to our fishing floet as a harbour of rofugo, etc,   4^     The following alternatives present themselves(a)       Island retained by Germany, all defence being destroyed,(b)       Island retained by Germany, tho harbour being destroyed      as well as all defence works,(c)       Island retained by Germany, but to be levelled to high      water mark.
 (d)       Island taken over by the loague of Nations, with      Holland or Denmark as the mandatory power.   All dofen.ee      works to be destroyed,, (o)       Island to be returned to Great Britain.   54     From the British point of viaw, (c) is considered thebest;  (b) is preferable to (a), but failure to got the harbourdostroyod is not likely to influence a possible future war toany material extent 0          Thero is not much difference between (d) ( and (a)because Germany would probably seize the Island if she went to .war,  (e).is not recommended unless we are prepared to make the island impregnable and tc maintain a strong garrison.   6,     To sum up,- tho signi.fican.ee of the harbour lies in theprotection which is afforded to it by tho fortifications on the island; and, unless the Island is reduced to such a condition thatit is impossible to erect&apos;fortifications upon- it, the harbourshould be destroyed so as to render it no longer an object; oftemptation to an aggressive Germany.(Inltd)    W,  E.
