6THE TWELVE-HOURS CLAUSE OF THE BREAD&apos; OHDKR /NJ) HI G&apos;HT BAKING;Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,Threat of Strike of Oporative&apos;Bakers.          I am informed by the Executive of the A.S.Operative Bakers     Confectioners and Allied Workers  that should the 12-hours Clause     of the Bread Order be withdrawn,  and the Master Bakers insist     on the resumption of nirf.it work in order to supply fresh bread     at an early hour, there weald be  a notional strike of Bakers..     They have circularised all their  branches on this point and there     has been an almost unanimous decision to strike in all districts     in the event of night work being  demanded in any district,-          It should be pointed out that the abolition of night work     (except in a very small number of large firms  working throughout     24 hours) was an incidental result of the issue of the Bread     Order.  Prior to its issue, bread was baked at night or in the     early morning and was sent out fresh at 7 or 8 o&apos;clock. Owing     to the Order, the bulk of bread baking is now  done during the     day as it has to be out of the oven by 7.0.p.m. in order to be     saleable in the morning.  The operatives are very determined not     to go back to continuous night work, which they regard as very   ,  detrimental to the menTs highest  interests, and if the matter     is forced by the employers, there will unquestionably be a     national strike.Proceedings of the Joint Industrial Co-.nc.il.          The National Association of  Master Bakers petitioned the     Ministry of Food for the withdrawal of the 12 hours Clause of     the Bread Order in November, but the matter first came before     the Joint Industrial Council on January 30th 1919, when the     following Resolution was passed unanimously.tiThis/
               &quot;This Joint Industrial Council urges upon, the                Ministry of Pood the withdrs7/al of the Twelve                Hours Clause of tho Bread Order imrcediaielu                upon an agreement being adopted by the Council                modifying or abolishing night work, and that                if necessary such agreement be enforced by                legislation.  That the General Purposes Corn-                mi the be authorised to discuss the terms of                such agreement with the Ministry of Labour                and tho Homo Office with no?jey- to a-;t on behalf                of the Council J&apos;        &apos; &apos;     &quot;     The General Purposes Committee met and passed two Resolutionsone appointing a Sub-Committee to draw up a scheme wherebynight work should be abolished, and a second one asking theGovernment to obtain the necessary powers for enforcing theagreement arrived at, provided that such agreement should notbe contrary&quot;to the public interest.     Between the first and second meetings of the Sub-Committeecertain events occurred which led to the total withdrawal fromthe Industrial Council of the three Associations of EnglishMaster Bakers other than the Co-operative Union Limited.  Theyofficially approached tho Ministry of Food with the reauest that another id. should be added to the sealing price of the loatfowing to extra, manufacturing costs which had arisen since thoprice was fixed.  This request was definitely refused and thisrefusal was made a pretext for the withdrawal of tho threeAssociations from the Joint Industrial Council.  At the sametime Resolutions were being passed by their subordinateorganisations protesting against tho action, of their represontativon the Joint Industrial Council, and contending that the abolitionof night work was &quot;impossible&quot; in London and certain of thelarge towns.  It certainly appears as if tho representatives ofthe English Master Bakers finding their action repudiated bysections of their organisations took advantage of tho actionof the Ministry of Food to get out of a difficult situation bytrying to break up the Council.  In this they wero not successful,                          -2-                              as/
    as  the  Scottish Master Bakers  and  tho representatives of tho    Co-operative  Union Ltd.  remained on  the Council.  The General    Purposes  Committee met again on March 5th with representatives    of  the  Operatives, the Scottish Master Bakers and the Co-    operatives  present and forming a quorum.  The fcrco latter bodies    state they  can carry on  their  businesses without recourse to    night baking.  Two Resolutions were  unanimously agreed to and    were presented by the Committee to the Ministry of Labour as    their considered,  judgment.        The  first resolution regretted  the withdrawal of the    Employers Associations from the Joint Industrial Council and    its Committees upon a matter of employees profits which had    not been  considered by the  Council;  and because this action    nullified the efforts which wore being made  by both  sides- to    arrive  at a settlement of the  night  work  question by agreement.        The  second resolution  was as  follows                &quot;That this meeting of  the General Purposes                 Committee of the  Joint  Industrial Council calls                 on the Ministry of Labour to take steps in the                 event of the Ministry of Pood   withdrawing the                 12-hon  Clause of tho Bread  Order to  secure its                 immediate substitution  by an Order prohibiting                 night work  between the  hours of 11. p,m. and 5  a.m.                 with the exception of the employment  of Lough-                 makers firemen and their assistants;  provisions                 for  breakdown  and holidays  and  to meet  the Sunday                 and  week-end difficulty and  for these  cases when                 employees are  now working 24 hours per  day; such                 working conditions to be adjusted locally when                 desirable.  The order suggested above  to be a                 temporary measure pending the resumption ond    -;r;,--:           completion  of  negotiations  with employers in the                 trade, and  thus in the  interim  preventing any                 stoppage in the bread supply of the country, and                 also giving on opportunity  to the trade of                 demonstrating  the possibility or otherwise of this                 modified form  of  the  abolition  of night baking.&quot;lues tions for - consideration.     The question to be considered is whether any, and if so what steps are practicable or desirable for preventing a                         -3-                            strike/
strike, and the consequent dislocation of the Bread supply,/s to the prospects of a strike, tho Union representsrather less than 50,000 operatives of all grades.  Thetotal numbers engaged in the industry are estimated at60,000 to 70,000.  P. difficult element in the case is thelarge number of- one-man businesses *hore the proprietor maybe classed as cither a Master Baker or an Operative Baker,The number of those is stated to bo about 15,000,  The Tradeis, however, highly organised in Lancashire, Yorkshire,Northumberland and the Midlands and moderately well in SouthWalos,  The strength of tho Union in London is variouslyestimated by the t*&apos;o sides, but it is doubtful if the union is strong enough to hold up the trade,  Elsewhere in theSouth and ?&apos;est the organisation in relatively weak.  Thecentre of the strike -&apos;ould hoover be jr Lor.don, as the demandfor night work is strongest auow - the large wholesalerswho have to deliver bread over large areas.  The small businesses could comply with the terms of the resolution and have new bread on sale at B,a.m, but the factories wouldbe at a disadvantage as thoy commence to send out vansbetween 6 a.m. and 7 a,m.  They would therefore be placed at a big disadvantage and consider that their businesseswould be threatened.     If a strike were confined to London it would probablycollapse, but if the industrial districts in the Northjoined in. there would unquestionably be a serious shortage in the bread supply.     The Finistrv of Labour being satisfied that all  ordinarycauses open to them to &quot;secure a settlement through tho  joint industrial Council have been exhausted, the followingcourses have to be corsMerod:-1,   To maintain tho c.&quot;iflt:!n.&apos;* Order prohibiting  the  sale                                                      of/
of new bread.     (The Ministry of Food declare this to be impracticable,as it is no longer possible adequately to enforce this orderernd it can no longer be contended that it serves the purpose for which it was imposed, viz. economy in food consumption).2.  For the Ministry of Food to be prepared in the event ofa strike becoming imminent to exercise their powers underSection 2 G.G, of Defence of the Realm Regulations (seeespecially par. 4) and to give directions prohibiting nightwork in Bakehouses subject to any necessary exceptions.     (The Home Office and the Ministry of Labour suggest.that in order to maintain the bread supply to the public andhaving regard to all the circumstances set out in thismemorandum it would be proper for the Ministry of Food to take this action.  The Ministry of Food however strongly dissenton the ground that such action would exceed the spirit if notthe letter of their powers under tho Dofone  of the realm regulations and that it is important for the Government not totake sides in an industrial dispute; also they are themselvesuncertain of the practicability of the proposals.3.  To stand aside and let events take their course,,     &quot;Apart from the consequences of B strike to the public,it is a serious objection that it would probably lead to thorestoration of night ?;ork which is, in the opinion of theMinistry of Lebour and the Home Office generally speakingunnecessary, and if unnecessary, most undesirable.  It wouldprobably cause great discontent).     I am strongly of opinion that the Second Course is theproper line of action to be followed and. I venture to advise the Cabinet accordingly,                               (Signed.)   R.3.Horne.                        -5-                    28.3,19.
