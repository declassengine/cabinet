             M                   ----:&apos;        //             j       HO^E, BREWING-                                71        jj&apos;  MgHORAHPTO BY.THE FOOD CONTROLLER.     I desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the present position of home brewing.     During the warj the output of beer for sale was reduced owing io the necessity for economy, in -tho use of cereals.     In order to control brewing i/ithln prescribed limits, the Ministry of Food in 1917 prohibited the sale of malt except (1) under licence, and (2) for the -purposes of home brewing to persons who proved that they had brewed home-made beer in 1910, quantities being restricted to 2 bushels of malt per man employed.  .Last year sales were permitted only to persons who obtained licences in 1917,      The amount of material involved is smalls and the necessity for economy no longer exists.   In these circumstances I air  unable to see any reason, so far as my Department is concerned, for continuing on home brewing any restriction which did not exist before the war, There Is, moreover,&quot;a very pronounced feeling in many parts of the country that present restrictions should cease,      I am, however, informed by Mis Majesty&apos;s Treasury that they are unable to assent td general relaxation of control since owing to &quot;the greatly increased Excise duty and.the restrictions on the output of &quot;brewers* the removal of the restrictions on home brewing could scarcely fall to stimulate. Its development to the prejudice of theRevenue,&quot;    His&apos;&apos;Majesty!s Treasury add that in their opinion any action taken should be confined to the Issue of licences for limited supplies of malt for private brewing to farmers who brewed harvest beer in-1916,      I desire to have the decision of the Cabinet as to whether home brewing should he allowed to go free, as I recommend, or whether the proposal made by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.should be accepted.     If the latter course is adopted, I hope it may be possible to make It clear that the continuance of the restriction is due to Excise considerations and not to the Food Controller,                                   CHARLES A. McCURDY, Ministry of Food,    -               .        .       21st March 1919.             for the Food Controller.
