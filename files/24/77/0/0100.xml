Twenty   Councils have as yet  made  no  proposals.   Of  the  ;.l County Boroughs   in England and tyalss  only  1 Council has as  yet acquired land for the I  purpose  of land  settlement.  This Authority  (Y7alsell) hay purchased   67 acres within  the Borough and  plans for establishing cottage I  holdings upon the Estate are  now under  the  consideration  cf the Board. \       Sii^Pliisory^Orders .   The Board have received during  the v/eek   notice of an order made by the Devon  County Council for the compulsory   hiring of 6 acres of   -  glebs land at Tedburn St,  Mary.       Offers of -Land by Landowners-.    The offers received  direct by   the Board in rerpon?e to the  President1s appeal to landowners for   land suitable for small  holdings now  number 126,  comprising   approximately 22,360  acres.  Of these  47 offers,  representing 2,660   acres, have been declined  as  unsuitable.       Farm Settlements administered by tho Board.    12,267 acres of land I  have been acquired and are being administered oy  the Board for .?arm j  Settlements,  It is  estimated that 4b&quot; 0 ex-Service men will ultimately l  settle cn this land,    Ac  present there are 96 ex-service men who have j  either taken up  holdings or who  are serving their probationary period. I i       On the Heath,Hill Settlement rents  have been  arranged for tho j  holdings to let  Llus  Lady  Bay,    12 ex-service men who rave completed   their  probationary period  will take up  holdings ranging from 7 GO 30 j  acres t    Sites for 9  pairs of cottages  have boon  selected,   Thes3   with alterations to existing  houses will suffice  to equip the   settlement with  houses in  accordance  with the plan for tho division of I  the land, I           - During the  last  week a considerable amount of spring corn I  has been drilled,  and with the exception of JO acres all  the oats I  are now,  sown;  to acres of peas  have  also bee a drilled.

(ii) Work of Agricultural 7.scecutive Committees.           The question of the reinstatement of land which had been taken for military purposes was alluded to in last week&apos;s report and a reply to the Department1s protest on the subject haa now been received from the War Office to the effect that it is not possible for them to undertake as a general rule the restoration of ouch land, but that military labour will be employed wherever it can be used with advantage and economy.   They also inform the Department that an Army Council Instruction will be issued regulating the advance to the persons concerned of an amount not excoeding 75$ of tho estimated cost pf reinstatement, this limitation not implying that no further sum will be paid en completion of the work.      Determination of Tonanclea.   During the week the Board have made an Order determining; the tenancy of a neglected farm (139-J acres) at Rawmarsh in the West Riding which is in the occupation of a farmer who, in the opinion of the Executive Committee^ offioere and of the Board1s District Commissioner, does not seem capable or anxious to improve its condition.   Ho has had the farm for 14 years and gives as an excuse for its present neglooted state the fact that it v/as in bad condition when he took it.   The excuse is not, however, considered a valid one and the tenancy has been determined.                       (iii)  Provision of Allotments.           The West Riding Executive Committee has during the past week been authorised to take possession of 2 acres of land at Morton Banks, 2 acres at Bhitlington and 1 acre at. Criggleston which they intend letting to the Parish Councils concerned for allotments.           The Department are informed that 2 Local Authorities have undertaken to acquire under the Cultivation of Lands Order altogether 6  acres of land which will provide 9G allotments.   tinier the - Small Holdings and Allotments Act 4 Local Authorities are acquiring 19i acres of land in order to be able to provide 98 allotments.   The Board&apos;s Inspectors have been instrumental in arranging for the letting direct to cultivators by the landowners of 21 acres of land which will provide 159 allotments.   3 appeals against notices to quit have been dealt with recently and in each case a continuance of the tenancy has been arranged;  48 holders were affected and the total amount of land in question was 3^- acres.                            (iv)  Land Drainage.           Altogether 21 Orders have now been made sotting up Drainage Committees in England and Wales.                             Horticulture Division. ruit Section.      Holbeach Crown  -Settlement.   The planting of the 10 acre and 5 acre Demonstration Fruit Plots at this Settlement has now been completed, under the supervision of one of the Board&apos;s Inspectors.\ The plots are now being wired in, and mulching the trees with farmyard manure and prundag are being done.           Inspeotions of orchards have boen  carried put  in Norfolk, Rutland and Huntingdon:  in  the last named county, steps have been taken to establish a demonstration fruit plot.   Tho&apos; Land Settlement Committee have agreed tc a proposal to provide  short courses of training  for ex-service men  in fruit growing  and market gardening  on  a  farm at Shippoa Hill, West Norfolk, for the use of which an offer has been made by Mr:. J. Chivers.
Small Live Stock Section.       fe-is.    Complaints are being received that  the  present  low prices  of eggs are causing poultry farmers considerable -anxiety  owing  to  the  fact that the price of feeding stuffs has not  been correspondingly  reduced.    The,, subject is being considered by  the  Poultry Advisory  Committee.       IndjL an Punner. 33u ck s.   The Ant i -halar ial  Sect ional St at ion,  Queensborough,  ] s/io&apos; of Shcppey, have asked tho Board if they can assist  them in the purchase  .bf Indian Runner Bucko,   The War  Office  Authorities at  this Stabion consider that after  the   larvae  ha8 been  cleared from the  Iuiand, this breed of ducks being good foragers would  keep down the growth  of tho larvae  and they propose  making experiments  as to the usefulness  of the ducks in this respect.Instruct ion and Advice,       ftume.- Counties ,   The allotments at Southbo rough and  Tunbridge  Wells have  been &quot;inspected:,  and a meeting of allotment holders  addressed,  .  There is great need for Improvement in  the methods of  cultivation in  the district and advice is eagerly  sought.           A scheme has been drafted by the West  Kent Horticultural  Sub-Committee for running demonstration plots  in the various allotment  centres,  and two  plots have been offered for the purpose.       ^M.^&apos;y 5ii^^Q5^5ll.s.S*   Visits have been  paid to various market  gardens in  Devonshire and Somersetshire,   One interesting feature of a  market garden at  Oorston, between Bristol and  Bath;  is  the very large  crops of  outdoor  tomatoes and cucumbers grown  beneath the trees in the  orchard,  and for-  several year J 14.000 tomato plants  have  been planted  Outside on  nearly an  acre of ground, while ridge cucumbers are  also  largely grown outside.       Midland- Counties.   A large meeting of allotment holders,  gardener^ etc.. was addressed at Wallasey at  the request  of  the  Cheshire  Horticultural Sub-Committee. .  There  are  no signs of any  decrees J  in the al-j.pt merit movement in this district, if any tiling keener  interest  in the  plots is being taken.   Nearly all the  allotment  holders are business  men.           In the  Derby district it was found that,  colliery owners  were using  a   -balk  of the manure produced at the pit  to.oultivate  their own lands.    Consequently, there is a. shortage of manure  for  allotment holders *           A lecture was given at Ripley on soils,  manures and cropping.       Ilia-stern Counties.   A visit has been paid to  the Small  Holdings in  the Korneastle  District of Lincolnshire,   These growers  obtain  extraordinary results from potato planting but in fruit growing their  methods are. \T/-r,:y  backward,   A movement is on  foot to secure a  system  of light  railways through the remote districts,  and  if  successful, it  will have important results.I            The Horticultural  Sub-Committee  for Nottinghamshire has  greatly  assisted  the Notts.  Federation  of  Allotment Holders byr purchasing  about  50  tons  of  Scottish  Seed  Potatoes and  selling  them to  allottees,   A vigorous campaign  against wart disease is being  started.            Visits  have been paid to  glass houses  and allotments  in the  Districts of Peterborough, Wisbech, Gayhouse and Whittiesea.    There  arc  prospects of  a good fruit  crop.   Advice has been given on  the  &quot;Summer  Spraying  of Fruit&quot; and the  hope wa3 expressed that the  Board  would  send  demonstrators  to  show  tho  proper methods of  packing  hard  and  soft fruits.
                     Technical and Cultivation Divisions.  Tec hni cal I)i vi si on&quot;&apos; &quot;t    jjt?-ti sties of Grass land broken 1917-1918.   Before the conclusion of the Armistice altered the agricultural position, steps had been taken to prepare a series of tables for each County in England and Wales show- ing the acreage of permanent grass in each of the 13,000 parishes that had been broken up between June 4th, 1917, and a similar date in 1918. These tables, v/hich are now complete, were primarily intended for dis- tribution to tho lilxecutiv-e Committees to guide them in the issue of ploughing orders,  but they will still be useful for purposes of future reference and comparison.     Analysis of Crops and Yielflft upon new Arable Land.    A full statistical analysis of the crops planted and the resultant yields on newly broken grass land for the harvest year 1917-16 ha^ just been completed.   Reports were obtained from practically every Executive Committee in England and Wales and covered 76,000 acres in 600 different parishes.   jVor the whole of England and Wales  the yield of wheat (31,3 bushels) and of oats (40c7 bushels) can be considered very satisfactory as it was equal to the ten-year average of these crops,  but that of the comparatively. small area of barley (28.C bushels) was decidedly poor. The yields from those counties situated west of a line drawn from the  . Humber to the Isle of Wight were greatly in excess of those obtained from counties east of it, and practically all the complete failures recorded were in the latter area.   The highest returns were found in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Iionmouth. Warwick and Cornwall, and the lowest from the south-eastern counties (h-ent, Surrey and Sussex) and a group comprising Cambridge, Huntingdon. Bedford, Hertford, Leicester and Northampton. It is probable that the deficiency of rainfall between Earch and June ever the eastern portion of England was responsible for this well-defined division, for the yields from the Welsh Counties were also uniformly good. In all, it would appear that some 200,000 acres of wheat, $50,000 acres of oats and 75,000 acres of barley were planted on the new arable land. Reports upon the other cereals, potatoes and roots showed returns in every case above the average in weight.   All the yields would have been considerably higher if more favourable weather conditions had prevailed at the time of harvest, for losses were everywhere occasioned by the autumn rains and gales.     Seed Testing Station.   In view of the replenishing of woodland areas and of extended planting, arrangements are being made at the Seed Testing Station to conduct tests of the seeds of forest trees.         It has also been arranged to show New Zealand soldiers who are studying agriculture in this country the working of the Station,.   These visit the Station in, par ties every Wednesday and their visits are expected to extenl over the next few weeks.     Trac tor So c t i on.   There are ten countiestin England working on the Contract System and seven of these head the list with the highest averages of work doen during the v/eek ended the 21st ult -   The highest average was 12.34 acres for 26 tractors in the East Biding of Yorkshire. Over 5,600.aoros were ploughed in England and 1,200 cultivated.   The cultivating was fairly evenly spread over the country, the largest amount being done in East Anglia and the south-western counties.   The leverage acreage for all operations was 4.70 acres per tractor in commission,   Only one-third of the tractors in the. counties were in commission,  and these were idle for about half the time owing to adverse weather conditions.   Tractor operations have been suspended in fcinc counties principally on account of bad weather conditions.         The work in Wales was almost entirely ploughing but  -the average acreage was only 2.72 acres per tractor in commission - just ever half that for England -   In this case the tractors were idle for too-thirds   the time on account of the weather .   Only one county in Wales (Carnarvon) is being worked on tho Contract System, where the amount Of v-ork por tractor is above the average .   The amount of work done in tho ^serious counties varied from half an acre in Brecon tc over 98 acres Qi&apos; ploughing in Glamorgan:  the total acreage was 460 including 30 acros cultivated.
          During the weok it was arranged  that  the Dorset AgriculturalJlxecutive Committee should retain half their tractors and correspondingftmplencnts until the end of September;  the remainder will be  disposed of at the end of hay.   The number of tractors  to be retained  until the end of September is now 880 out of a total  of 3,020.   Ten Committees have not yet submitted their liquidation proposals..     )Lechapi cnl.Se ot1on *   Although, as st *fc ed  above, for the  last week for whi cii figures are available, the average,  /acres-go per tractor in Wales was lees than&apos;in England, h. previous weeks the average  has been higher.   There has been a steady improvement in the work in Wales both in output and in cost and this result io due very   largely tc  the efforts of the Technical Inspectors.   Evidence of the good work of those officers Is also afforded by the fast that surplus tractors and implements in Wales have not required any  special expenditure  to put th^m in repair before sale,     Requi.rcngntiJiid^^Di^ojsal, Section,   During the week ended 5th April letiw. ns wt sjm.e 5 havo l;ecn r coo i ;ed  from  Wilts, Devon.

Up to  date 186  sales have been held for which 159 returns are to hand.    Twenty-five further sales have been fixed and arrangements are being made for further sales.          In addition to  the above many machines and implements have been transferred to forms in the occupation of Committees, Training  Centres, Farm Settlements and the  Flax Produce ion Department.   Extensive purchases nave boen made  for the land Drainage Section.    .Ereh0^^n\cLlRii    Including the horses taken over by- the Board1 s farms  and colonies,  a further  230 horses have been disposed of  during the past  wee]-, a v. raging   76 per horse.   The best prices realised were at Larket Bosworth and Ipswich, whore the average was over  80.          The total number of horses sold and transferred to date is 4,300.

In a Circular issued by the Board on  the 25th February toall local Authorities under the Order; attention was drawn to themeasures that should be taken in Urban Districts and itms pointed outthat it is estimated that in 7t per cent,  of the cases of rat invasion of shops and dwelling houses in Urban Districts the invasion is due todefective drains.          It is to be hoped that the complaints made to the Prince of wales at his inspection of slum premises in Southwark on the 3rd inst.and the statement of the President of the  Local Government Board onthe 4th inst. at the Conference of Municipal and County Sngineers,namely, &quot;that there are in our cities, houses swarming with vermin andjunfit for habitation&quot; will give point to the advice in our Circular,land arouse the Authorities to whom the Circular was addressed and leadto their taking adequate action.                      -          There is, undoubtedly, evidence  of the increase in the ships1Irat in this country, and it is most important that Public Health^Authorities should give special attention to the subject.

The County statements and statistics of educational work will now be examined in detail and the necessary abstracts will be prepared.           In relation to Colleges correspondence  on reconstruction has now been begun.  From the replies to a recent circular which  have  been received it is evident that the need of additional  grants is  very  great, particularly to meet increases in the salaries of the staff..           Conferences were held during the  week with the  Agricultural Education Sub-Committees of Dorset and Devonshire..   At Dorchester&apos; the board&apos;s letter of 8th January on the development  of Agricultural Education was discussed In some detail.  Chief interest was displayed in the future constitution of the Agricultural Education Committee and in the cost of providing a Farm Institute. A property  known as the Little Commonwealth had been offered to the Committee as  a site. for an Institute but had been rejected.  The Committee decided to  make enquiries as to the possibility of securing a suitable farm.   At Exeter the relations of the County Education Committee to the Governors of the Seale Hayne College we re discussed.   The suggestion  was made. that the College should function a3 the Farm Institute for  the County. Difficulties were raised from both sides, but ultimately a  Committee containing representatives of both parties  was set  up to  endeavour to frame a scheme for co-operation.           Arrangements are being made for the transfer of certain sections of work to the new Horticultural Division.                              Dairy Branch.I      Encouragement of cheese making Scheme.   Active, preparations are now in progress for the re-establishment of Travelling and Co-operative Cheese Schools.  The work however, is being hampered by the  underfcainty of the position of cheese in respect to milk.  An impression  seems to have got abroad generally that the Ministry of Food intend  to fix  a moderately high price for summer milk and at the  same time  to de- control cheese and further, that the Ministry have  purchased  a bulk of Colonial Cheese which it is their intention to dump on the  market  as
 GOon  ao  control  is  removed,  and  the view  taken  is that if this comes to -pass  a very  severe  blow will be  dealt  to  the cheese making industry in this  country.  For  this reason,&apos;  action in many  casec  is being delayed pending  an official announcement of what  really is to be done.          Captain Pet re has?  taken up duties  in  the Branch as a temporary inspector under  the  cheese making scheme .  He will replace Mr. Benson from  the end of this  month,      Arable  Da: iy Farms.

MS5^X4^J[ y^he se .  At  the request of the Department of Agriculture  and  Technical  Instruction  for Ireland a Conference has been held  with the Representatives  of that  Department-/concerning the desirability of  a standard being fixed for whole- milk cheese and for partly skim  cheese. The Irish Department say that they are satisfied that  the interests  of  the.  Industry demand the fixing  of a standard basis on the percentage of fat and dry matter and they propose to take action,  but  they would prefer  that such action  as is  taken should apply to Great Britain as hell as  Ireland;,   There  is  a good, deal to be said in favour of oho proposal  and  the Branch  propose to take action-  It is proposed  to enquire further, into the matter  proceeding in the first instance by  confer ring with  the  representatives of the cheecemaking industry whose support It  would  seem desirable  to obtain before arranging that a standard  should be fixed..

A case in which legal proceedings v/ere instituted againBtan employer in Norfolk,  for the purpose of obtaining a deoision on thequestion as to whether lump sums such as harvest money, Michaelmas  .money, etc. could bo spread over a period and counted as part ofwages for the purpose  of making up the weekly wages to the minimumwas heard at Downiiam Market on the 31st March,          The first case heard was that of a worker employed as ashepherd who was paid the equivalent of 35s. each week, (namely 32s.in cash,  together with a rent and rafe-free cottage), together with 8 Michaelmas money at Michaelmas, which spread over the year would bring the weekly wages to over the minimum of 36s. a week.  the worker stated in evidence that the Michaelmas money was standingwages, and that if he  left at any time during the year he would gota proportion of such wages.  The Court held that under these circum-stances the Michaelmas money could be counted as wages, and that nooffence had accordingly been committed.          The second case was that of a shepherd who was paid the equivalent each v/eek of  35s. (namely 32s. oash and a rent and rate-free cottage) and he also received a lump sum at Michaelmas ascommission on all rams let and sold.  The lump sum paid at Miohaolmas
in this case was not a fixed sum,   For the  year ending Michaelmas,1910, it amounted to over  11,  and if it could he  spread  and addedto the weekly wages no underpayment would have occurred.   The  Bench-held that the ram money could not  he regarded as wages, and  ordered the employer to pay Is. in respect of the underpayment in the  weekc o v o re d b y t he s urns .          The worker in the third  case was  a teamsman who received34s. a week in cash and no cottage, hut who,  in addition  to  his  weeklywages, received a lump sum for harvest.  The  employer admitted inevidence that the harvest wages were paid in respect of harvest  alone,and the Bench held that the harvest wages could not ho spread.They accordingly ordered tho employer to pay the worker 2s.  in respectof the underpayment in the one week to which the sums related.          Proceedings were in the  nature of a friendly test  case, andprosecuting Counsel stated that the Wages Board did not desire the.,imposition&quot; of a penalty or the recording of a conviction, hut  wouldhe satisfied with an Order for the payment  of the  arrears if the Benchheld that tho workers had &quot;been paid at less than the minimum rate.          An employer in Cardiganshire, who is an  official of  animportant -Hmiployers&apos; Organisation, was summoned at Cardigan on the  1stApril in respect of the payment of two of his workers at  IOBS  than  theminimum rates applicable to them.   The first case, that of a soldier.,was dismissed by the Bench on the  ground that the  employer acted onthe instructions he received from the Commanding Officer.  In the caseof tho second worker tho employer was convicted, fined  3, and ordered to pay Counsels foe.          An employer in Oxfordshire was summoned  at Bicester on the4th April for tho payment of 4 of his workers at less than thominimum rates applicable to them,  three of  them being boys under 18.As regards the three boys the employer was  convicted and  fined 10s.in each case, and ordered to pay the  rears amounting to   2. 2s., 2. 16s., and  1. 10s-., respectively.
