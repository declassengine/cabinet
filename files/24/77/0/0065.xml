THE RAILWAY SITUATION.Notes of a Conference held in Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s  Room at the Board of Trade,                   on Wednesday, March 19, 1919, at 4 P.M.                                  Present:         The Rt. Hon. Sir E. C. GEDDES, G.C.B., G.B.E. (in the Chair).The Rt. Hon. Sir A. STANLEY, President  of the Board of Trade.Sir HERBERT WALKER,  K.G.B., Railway  Executive Committee.Sir W.  E.  MARWOOD,  K.C.B.,  Joint  Secretary, Board of  Trade.The Rt. Hon. Sir ROBERT HORNE, K.C.,  K.B.E.,  Minister of  Labour.Sir ALEXANDER BUTTERWORTH, Railway  Executive Committee.Lt.-Col. J. G. BEHARRELL, D.S.O.Mr. G. M.  EVANS,  Assistant Secretary, War Cabinet.               The Committee met in accordance with a decision of the War           Cabinet (W.C. 546, Minute  1)  in order to consider the terms of           an offer to  be made to the railwaymen in reply to the demands           they had put forward in their national programme.               Sir Eric Geddes said  that the  offer so  far  made  by the           Railway Executive, as he understood  it, was that a certain pro-           portion of the present war  wage  of  the railwaymen  should be           transferred to the permanent  wage,  so: as to make  the [latter           equivalent to a 50 per cent,  increase on pre-war earnings.  This           appeared to mean  that  if a man before the  war  was earning           20s. a week plus 10s. overtime, 15s. a week would now have to           be transferred from the war wage to his permanent  wage.            ,  Sir Herbert1, Walter pointed  out that  this was  not quite           correct.  It might be  that of any sum let us say 15s. which it           was proposed to  transfer a certain proportion, say, perhaps 5s.,           would be due on account of what might  be called the &quot; side shows,&quot;           that is  to say, overtime,  Sunday duty, and so  on, thus the basic           wage of the man would  be increased  by 10s. only; 23s. of the,           present war wage would still remain war wage and would be           liable to  variation, according as the  cost of  living fluctuated.           A  proportion of the higher-rated men&apos; might thus) gain some           increase immediately.   Mr.  Bromley,  the   Secretary  of  the           A.S.L.E.F.,  was prepared to negotiate on this  basis, although he           did not consider  the  increase sufficient.  He (Sir H. Walker)           thought, too,  that  Mr.  J. H.  Thomas  would agree with  the           Railway Executive as to the  basis,  but the delegates  of  the           National Union of Railwaymen would oppose it.[1566]                                                         B
    Sir Eric Geddes enquired,  supposing that the present pro.posed transference was an adequate one,  what was the justifica-tion for giving the men something more above the increase grantetin their substantive pay and overtime.    Sir Herbert Walker said that before the war the lower-ratedrailwaymen were admittedly underpaid; they argued that the pre-sent increase of 35s. per week had been given them to cover theincrease in the cost of living, and on this basis they were stillunderpaid and entitled to  a further increase.  At  the same time they desired betterment of their service conditions.  The railwaywas the  only  industry  in  which  the  war  wage was   on asliding  scale.   In all other industries the war-rates were  fixed,and the men  in those industries had a definite basis on which tonegotiate.  The railwaymen were afraid that as the cost of livingdecreased they would  gradually see their war wage  disappear,and if, in the meantime, no increase was made to their permanentrates they would have nothing with which to negotiate.    Sir Eric Geddes enquired  whether  it  would  be possible toadopt Sir Robert Horne&apos;s  suggestion with regard  to the sliding scale, namely,  that it  should be abolished  and the present war wage stabilised for a year.    Sir Herbert Walker  said  that he  wa&apos;s satisfied  that this solution would  not be accepted by Mr.  Bromley, who argued thatthe flat rate war wage was prejudicial to the men of his Union,who for the most  part were engine-men drawing high wages,The present increase of 33s. a week meant an increase of 132 percent, in the case of the average railwayman whose wage  beforethe war was only 25s. per week.   In the case of drivers the increaseamounted to  only 68 per cent.   The A.S.L.E.F. desired that therelative positions of the skilled  and unskilled railwaymen shouldbe the same as  before the war.    Sir  Robert Home pointed  out that the public  would notsympathise much with the  claims of higher grade men for special treatment.    Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that the addition of the present war wage had more than doubled the pre-war earnings;  at thesame  time the  institution  of the 8-hour day would cost at  least 11,000,000 a year, and the addition of ,a further  10,000,000 wasentailed in the rest of the men&apos;s demands outside wages.  If these facts were pointed out to the public, and in addition the public were told that the men had been offered a 50 per cent, increase on theirstandard  rates to be  transferred from  their  war  wages,  or alternatively  that  the Railway Executive  had  undertaken  to stabilise the present war wage and abolish &quot;the sliding scale untilthe end of the year, thus  bringing the railwaymen on the same basis  as those  in other industries, and  that the whole question would be  thrashed out later on  in the year&quot;, when  it was clearerwhat  the  conditions of  the  industry  would be, he thought theGovernment would gain the support of the public.    Sir Herbert Walker pointed out that Mr. Bromley had already accepted the  50 per cent,  basis  of negotiation on  condition thathis men obtained an immediate increase.    Sir Eric Geddes continuing, said there was no economic orcompassionate  justification for  a further increase in the men&apos;swages.  The  country understood now  that  the extra cost wouldhave to be paid by the  general public, and they would not be keenon  increasing the bill.   In any case it  was certain that  if theminers came out the railwaymen would not be satisfied with any-
 thing the Government would offer; whereas, if the miners stayed in,  the railwaymen  would probably still continue  to negotiate. The great point now was to get the public behind the Government in  the  matter of the  terms  which  the latter  offered to the railwaymen.     Sir Herbert  Walker pointed out that  he had prepared an answer  to the men&apos;s demands.     Sir.  Eric Geddes  then  read  out  the  proposition  which Sir  Herbert Walker suggested should be made to the railwaymen&apos;s representatives, the chief points of which were as follows:-     (1.) That the present regulation as regards the  war  wage           should continue in force until the 31st December, 1919.           This would ensure that the war wage would not fall           below 30.9. a week.     (2.) To offer an increase  which should include  all  &quot;side           shows &quot; of 50  per cent,  on the  pre-war earnings. It           should be  decided by the men  as  to how  this  increase           should be  distributed between  standard rates and           &quot; side shows.&quot;  As  soon  as the basis of  increase was           agreed upon  the transference  from the war  wage to           the permanent rate should take effect immediately; but           until the end of the year no man would receive less           wages than he did at the present  day.     (3.) A Committee should be appointed to see how much, if           any, of the remainder of the war wage (after deducting           the 50 per cent, increase on the standard rates) should           be ultimately transferred to permanent wages.     It was generally agreed that with regard to (1) the war wage should be stabilised at the present figure of 33s.     Sir Robert Home  suggested  as  an alternative to Sir H. Walker&apos;s  plan the  following  offer:  that  the men should be guaranteed their present earnings up to December 31,  1919, and in the meantime negotiations should continue on all the points at issue,  a definite - promise being  given  that  the permanent wage from January 1,  1920,  should not be less  than  an increase of 50  pei1  cent,  on  the  pre-war  earnings;  the frehiaindefr of the: war wage  would then be the subject of negotiations in exactly the same way as in the case of  other industries.     Sir  Herbert Walker thought that neither Mr.  Thomas nor Mr.  Bromley would accept that offer.   It was not certain what attitude the public would take.  At the present time the average earnings including war  wage and  overtime amounted to  about 65s.  a week.  The  Government were undertaking that this should not  be decreased between  now and  December 31.   It had  been agreed with  Mr.  Bromley that an  attempt should be  made to arrange  matters on the basis he (Sir H. Walker)  had suggested; when that basis was  arrived at a standard war  wage would be fixed, with the proviso that no man should be worse off  between now and December 31.  A few of  the higher paid men would be better  off, and it was because Mr. Bromley had seen that  his men would benefit  that he had  consented to continue negotiations.     Sir  Eric  Geddes suggested  that the two alternatives which had  been put forward should be offered both to the A.S.L.E.F. and to the N.U.R.     It was pointed out, however, that this would be deferring any permanent increase to the end of the year, while at the same time the two Unions might accept different alternatives which would give rise to a very anomalous position.   The  Committee   then proceeded to  discuss the  suggestions  put forward  by Sir HerbertWalker and Sir Robert  Home.
    Sir Albert Stanley said that  he  was afraid that any offer of the kind suggested would give rise to a great  deal  of mis-imderstanding, both  among  the men. and among the public.   he doubted  whether it  would  be possible, by stabilisation of  thewar wages to meet both the N.TJ.R. and the A.S.L.E.F.   Couldthey not offer to  negotiate as to whether  any additional adjust-meiits could be made with  regard to  particular  grades?  this might meet the claims of both Unions.    Sir Herbert  Walker pointed out that it was easy to go tothe public and tell them that we were prepared to add 50 per cent.on the  standard  rates.  There were,  however, great  anomaliesthroughout the whole country in the case of men  doing the samework  side  by  side and getting different wages.  We wanted tolevel up these differences and not to accentuate them.    Sir Albert Stanley said that  if a 50 per cent, increase weregiven now it would proportionately reduce the  amount of money which the Railway Executive would have  to negotiate with later on on the other points at issue.  He suggested that each item ofthe rnen&apos;s programme should be  considered separately  and an offer made in each case.  It might be possible afterwards to adjust the differences bet wen the two Unions.    Sir A. Butterworth  said that certain offers  had, been made which the men had accepted; for example, the Railway executive had agreed to pay time and  a quarter for overtime, time and a halffor Sunday duty,  and to  allow a week&apos;s holiday on  full pay eachyear.   These offers had been made, however, with the proviso that agreement was reached, on the whole programme.    Sir Robert Home said that he  thought  they  should makeimmediately what was a fair offer and publish it at once.    Sir Eric Geddes said that there was little difference betweenthe proposals put forward by Sir Herbert  Walker and Sir RobertBorne.  He thought  the public would have little sympathy  forthe railwaymen if either  offer were refused. It was not economi-cally  possible to  give a higher wage than they were getting atpresent, as the railways  could, not afford  it.  The only justifica-tion for giving more would be in order  to keep the  men fromstriking, and that would be merely yielding to force.    Sir Robert Home pointed out that the men  desired agreement on their minor claims as well as on the claim for  the increasedwage.   Would the present offer enable them to say that they  hadbeen granted nothing in respect of their claims on &quot; side shows &quot;?    It  was pointed out  that the  cost of wages  for men in theconciliation grades in 1913  amounted to  28,000,000 per annum;at present, including war  wage,  the cost  was  62,000,000  perannum, and this did not include the eight-hour  day.  The present proposal was  that from January  1, 1920,  the cost of their wages should  amount to  42,000,000 per annum.  To  any claims  for increases  of overtime, &amp;c, it should be pointed out to them thatthe additional  14,000,000 was the maximum increase which theGovernment  was  prepared to make, although, the distribution ofthis increase between standard rates and &quot; side shows &quot; was opento. adjustment.     A discussion ensued  on the cost of the men&apos;s demands,  andthe cost of the proposed  offer by the Railway Executive.     It  was pointed out  that by the end of the present  year therailways would be employing about 400,000 men in the conciliationgrades.   The present war wage would mean that this  would  cost the State about  40,000,000, in addition to the pre-war  expendi-
  ture on wages.  If the men&apos;s programme was granted it would  mean an additional  31,000,000 a year.  At the same time it was  unlikely that additions to the wages of the 300,000 men in the  non-conciliation grades would amount to  less than  30,000,000.  This would give a total increase by the end of the year of about   101,000,000 per  annum in the wages bill.      With  regard  to the proposed offer, it was pointed out that a  50 per cent,  increase to all  grades would mean  an increase of   25,000,000  a year.   The eight-hour day  would  cost another   9,000,000, so that the total increase would be about  34,000,000  a year on a  wages bill which in 1913  had amounted to about   50,000,000.   In  addition, it was  estimated that the  cost of  materials would be an increase of at least  20,000,000 a year and.  rates and taxes about  6,000,000 a year up.      Sir Albert Stanley said that he was not in entire agreement  with the proposed offers to the men.  He would like to approach  the problem in the hope that by making  an offer which would be  something  more than  had  been suggested up to the present, it  would, if possible, secure acceptance by  the two Unions,  and so  their support for  the  Government at the meeting of the  Triple  Alliance to be held on the following Friday;  and  that it  should  be an  offer understood and formally supported by  the public, the  press, and the House of Commons.  Too much stress should not  be laid on the cost of operating the  railways during the war  resulting from the increase in wages.  These  increases had been  given on account of the increased cost of living, and although the  men&apos;s  demands would have a bad effect on the industry, the same  argument could be applied to  all  other industries.   It was desir-  able to see what  would be the additional cost of running the  railways, not  in the present conditions, but when  conditions be-  came more nearly  normal  again,  taking  into account the  higher  income which would accrue on account of a higher currency.  It  was estimated that the increased cost to the railway companies,  based  on a 50 per cent, increase on the  1913  wage rates, and including the cost of the 8-hour day, the increased cost of materials and the rise in rates and taxes, would amount to about  60,000,000 a year; but in all  cases dealing with the demands  of men  for an iu crease in wages he had found that the  actual cost to the industry invariably worked  out at less  than the estimated increase.     Sir Herbert Walker pointed out  that in this case, the estimates were made  on known figures, namely, a 50 per cent, increase on the actual wage bill for 1913.     Sir Albert Stanley said that no account had been taken of the fact that economies would probably be made in  various  direc- tions.   Continuing, he said  that there was no kind  of uniformity of grading  throughout the  railway system, and its absence bad been a constant source of irritation.  The Unions were now asking that these grievances should be discussed so that they could  be got rid of,  and  the men made more contented.  The present proposi- tion was that we should say to the men: &quot; During  this year we cannot  teli you what may happen in the railway world.  We are prepared to allow the present position to remain stabilised during that time, and promise  that on January 1, 1920, your permanent earnings will  be advanced by not less than 50  per cent.&quot;   The men&apos;s demands had been put  forward with a view to getting  a permanent increase at once,  and to the standardising of the con- ditions.  These demands we were not going to&apos;  touch during thisyear, but we were offering  to  meet the men in the  course of theyear in order  to see what could be done  regarding the existinganomalies within  the  limits  of  50 per  cent, increase.   Thissuggestion had been put forward  as a basis  for a negotiation.He had spoken to the Prime Minister and to Mr. Bonar Law on
the matter, and he gathered that  their  opinion  was  that theRailway Executive wo aid have to offer, more.  At the same timethe men would be able to say that their immediate demands werebeing turned down, and that they were getting nothing until theend of the year.    Sir Robert Home pointed out that their war wage would be stabilised and the sliding scale abolished.    Sir Albert Stanley, resuming, said that the men were alreadyprobably convinced that  the  position would be stabilised as theresult  of further negotiations.  They had been working undergreat difficulties, and with, a sense of grievance which everyoneadmitted.  There was no justification for our refusing until theend of the  year to settle grievances which we  were prepared torecognise on  the sole plea that  settlement would mean a heavy burden on the industry.  &quot;The men would argue that in some ofthe bigger industries adjustments had been made, since they hadnot entered into a  truce with the employers, as  in the case of the railwaymen.  For  instance, the miners had forced the Govern-ment to grant them big concessions during the war.  There wasno  doubt that  the railwaymen had very legitimate grievanceswhich  ought  to be put right.  It was impossible to refuse for awhole  year  to  remove the  anomalies  existing in  the industry.Consideration should be given  to  all the demands outlined intheir programme.  A refusal would precipitate a strike.   It was generally recognised that Sunday work and all-night work shouldbe paid for at a higher rate, and these points could certainly begranted. In the same way with regard  to the men&apos;s scheme fora share in  the management:  it was generally  admitted that themen should have a better  knowledge, of the  conditions of theindustry.  Surely something could be put in the reply which wouldgive the men the hope that this would be done.  Otherwise, whenthe Government&apos;s  reply  to the  men&apos;s demands were published,it would be pointed  out that, while recognising the existence ofgrievances,  the Government had given a blank refusal to deal withthem.  The &quot;side  shows,&quot; as they had been called, would causemore argument and  misunderstanding than any question of thepermanent  increase in wages.  He  appealed that the men&apos;s pro-gramme should be  considered item by item, and that it should be announced that the war wages would be continued for the present,while the Government would try to meet the men on each pointin their programme.    Sir Eric Geddes suggested that Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s proposalamounted to  a continuation of the negotiations.  He pointed outthat at the end of the year half of the men&apos;s demands would havebeen granted, while thei question of increasing the permanentwage would not have been touched.  The men  were now getting132 per cent, more than before the war.  It  was  impossible to ignore the economic  effect on the  industry.   The pre-war profiton the railways had  been turned into a loss.   If the proposal ofthe Railway  Executive that  they should transfer from the war wage to the permanent wage an amount equivalent to 50 per cent.of the  pre-war earnings were  a reasonable figure, he thought therewas no point in departing from  it at  present.  If Sir  albert stanley&apos;s proposal  were accepted, it would mean that at  the endof the year when the men came forward with their demand for anincrease to the permanent wage all the  other concessions wouldalready have been  granted to them, and  there would be no room for negotiation.  As things stood at present,  we were preparedto offer the men  34,000,000 a year as  a minimum increase ontheir pre-war wage bill  of  50,000,000.   At the same time,  wewere prepared to negotiate with them as to the distribution ofthis amount and as. to the removal of their other grievances. When
it came to the point it might be discovered that the  34,000,000was too small an increase and compared unfavourably with otherindustries.   In any case, he thought that the amount by which theGovernment were prepared to increase the men&apos;s wages should begiven to the public.    Sir Robert  Home said that if Sir  Albert  Stanley did notconsider the present offer to be  a fair one it would be difficult to convince the public on the point.  It would hot do to give the mena  chance of  saying that nothing had been  done to remove the anomalies which existed throughout the industry.    Sir A. Butterworth said that he would be prepared to try andsettle  the side-shows if this would prevent a strike.    Sir Eric Geddes  said that the  present  proposal was asfollows:     That the present war wage should be continued to the  end of        the year and should not be subject to the sliding scale        agreement.  In the interim period negotiations  should        take place to see if the Railway Executive could meet        the men&apos;s Unions on all the points put  forward.   At the        same time they should have a permanent increase in their        standard  rates of 50 per cent,  on the 1913 earnings. As        soon as the basis of increase had been agreed upon steps        should be taken to transfer from the&apos; war  wage to per-        manent rates the amount agreed upon.    (At this point Sir Eric Geddes, Sir  Albert Stanley, and sir robert Home left  the room to confer.)    On their return,    Sir Albert Stanley  said that they had just seen Mr. J. H.Thomas, who had indicated certain concessions which he suggested should be included in the Executive^ offer to the Unions  on thefollowing day.    The concessions suggested were as follows:     1. That  the present war  wage  should  be stabilised for a          certain period.    2. That district rates should be established; that is to say,          that men doing the same  work in the same district          under the same conditions should have the same pay.    3. Night work: Where a man isi booked on after  6 p.m. at          night, works after midnight and is booked off  before          6  a.m.  in the morning, he should receive pay  at the          rate of  time and a quarter.    4. Pay  for  overtime  should be at  the rate of time  and a          quarter.    5. Pay for Sunday duty should be at the rate of time and a          half.    6. The  claims  with regard to shopmen  and non-Unionists          to be settled by negotiations.    7. Management:  To meet  the present  situation it  was          suggested that the Railway Executive and members of          the Unions should confer to see if an agreement could          be arrived at as to  the  setting up of machinery for          dealing with problems affecting the men&apos;s conditions          of service.    Some discussion then ensued on the proposals put forward byMr. Thomas.
k.8    Sir A. Butterworth pointed out that the claims for a districtrate would give rise to grave difficulties, because it would not bepossible to limit the concession to equalising rates  in competitivetowns.    It was stated, however, that Mr.  Thomas had said he wouldconfine his claims to the equalising of rates in  separate towns.    Sir Eric Geddes, with regard to the question of management,said that he thought this could be met if the men knew that theywould have a share in the Consultative Labour Section to be setUP  under  the Ministry of Ways and  Communications.    The Committee then adjourned in order  to bring before theWar Cabinet at a meeting to be held at 9 p.m. the same evening;the proposals that had been put forward.    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,          March 20, 1919.o
