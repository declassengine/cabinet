The adjourned National Industrial Conference met on Friday, the 4th April, at 10.30&apos;a.m.  The Report  of the Provisional Committee  appointed  on the 27th February  hadbeen circulated, and had obviously gratified the majority of the delegates.   After shortintroductory speeches  from the Minister of  Labour and Sir Thomas  Munro, Chairmanof the Provisional Committee, there was an hour&apos;s questioning,  dealt with in part by theMinister as chairman, but mainly by Mr. Henderson, the Chairman of the Trade union side of  the committee, and  Sir Allan Smith, the Chairman of  the  Employers&apos; side.  Itwas noticeable that the employers took no part in the discussion.  The two sides of theConference then separated to  consider the  Report in detail.  On the resumption at 3.30p.m., Mr. Henderson moved and  Sir Allan Smith  seconded the following resolution :            &quot; That this Joint National Industrial Conference, representing the Employers and the        Trade Unions, welcomes the Report of the Provisional Joint Committee, and agrees to submit        it for the acceptance of its constituent  organisations  immediately the Government officially        declare their  readiness to proceed at once with the legislative  and other steps necessary to        carry the Repoit into effect.           &quot; That the  Provisional Joint Committee remain in being until the National Industrial        Council and the Standing Committee have been brought into operation.    The resolution  was carried unanimously.(C 1739)  140 4/19 EU
    It was evident from the discussion in the morning that the Committee&apos;s Report had made a good impression.  Several speakers, including Mr. Henderson,  Mr. Thomas, andMr. Clynes,  emphasised the large measure of agreement that had been reached, and the promise of better relations implied in that agreement.  The discussion was good-temperedand practical.  It contrasted with the previous meeting in its concentration on the imme-diately realisable; on the 27th February there  was the same desire to  find a way  outof the industrial difficulties of  the country, but political references were loudly cheered ;on the 4th  April the one or two references to political  questions evoked no sympathy and, when persisted in, were shouted down.  The optimistic tone of the meeting contrastedalso with the tone of the Joint Conference of the Trade Union Congress and the national labour Party in the same hall on the previous  day, which  was sullen and threatening.Perhaps the most significant feature of the meeting was that the Labour representativesfully and frankly accepted the  agreed Report as a programme of industrial reconstruction,although  it  fell  so very far short of the policy outlined by their  own representatives inthe latter&apos;s  appendix to the  Report.  &apos; They accepted Mr. Henderson&apos;s plea that it wasnecessary to proceed by degrees.    The questions and discussions touched on but did not  press all the chief points of controversy in the Report.   The refusal of some employers to recognise trade unionism ;the difficulty of enforcing locally national agreements or awards; the relation, to employerson the one hand  and to the trade unions of the ordinary workers on the other, of employees in a position of trust  or confidentiality ; the claim of the workers to a real association with employers in the direction and control of industry ;  these were all raised,  but it waspossible in each  case to show either that the Report provided for  the difficulty raised, or that the subject could best be left to the National  Industrial Council to deal with.  TwoLabour speakers objected to  the proposal to make collective agreements about wagesand  hours legally binding ;  but the  sense of the  meetings  was  against them, and noamendment was proposed.  It should be noted  that in 1913, when last  the proposal tomake legal  agreements as regards wages was before the Trade  Union Congress, it was defeated by a large  majority.   The project of a permanent  National Industrial council was generally welcomed, and  the success of the Provisional Committee in getting out afull and practical report in the short time at its disposal was taken as an indication ofthe kind of  work such a joint  body could undertake.    The only other point of note-in the discussion was an appeal by Mr.  Clynes to theindustrial organisations that had refused to participate in the setting up  of the ProvisionalCommittee to recognise their  responsibility to less organised workers and co-operate incarrying out the Report.  Mr. Thomas replied by  recognising fully these responsibilities and eulogising the Report;  but he  had  no power to commit  the Triple  Alliance  to aceptance.    The terms  of the  resolution in which  the Conference  welcomed  the Report were apparently  chosen with the express intention of  throwing on to the Government  theresponsibility for making the  recommendations effective.  The chairman, in opening themeeting, had read the Prime Minister&apos;s letter promising &quot; immediate and sympathetic consideration &quot; for the Report, if the Conference adopted it,  and the chairman&apos;s explana-tion of the steps that had already been taken and of his own  attitude to the recommenda-tions  was very well received.  But the mover and seconder  of the resolution, expressing the sense of the  separate meetings of the two sides, insisted on more.  The Governmenthad thrown the  responsibility for finding a solution for the  present industrial unrest onthe Conference;  having provided, as it thought,  a solution, the Conference refused to relieve the Government of any  of the responsibility for dealing with  the industrial situation.The resolution was carried unanimously, no alterations being made in  the Report itself.The mover and  seconder had, it  may be noted,  frequently insisted in the  discussions ofthe drafting committee that the  National Industrial Council would not be of any valueif the Government did not give to its advice much greater  weight than  had been givento the advice of  any  advisory committee during the war.  The procedure they adopted inregard to the Report at the National Conference enabled them to test the  Government^intentions before they take any further steps.    Altogether the result of  the Conference was  distinctly  encouraging,  but it shouldnot be overlooked that the Report skated over  some  dangerous questions  (e.g., whetherthe statutory 48-hour week was to imply maintenance of earnings), and  omitted to dealwith others  (e.g., the question of control, which figures prominently in the Trade union memorandum attached to the Report).   Questions like these will certainly be  raised bythe Trade Union representatives on the National Council, when formed, and will severelytest its efficiency to  deal with the radical causes of industrial unrest.  But a good starthas undoubtedly been made.
                      PART II.-DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.    The Work of Local Advisory Bodies.        In dealing with the mass of detailed work involved in demobilisation and resettlement,    it was  felt from the  first to be necessary to make full use of local knowledge and in-    fluence.  Accordingly,  a system  of  local  bodies  was set up representative both  of    employers and  employed.  The initial  step was taken, at  a  time  when the cessation    of  hostilities  was still  distant, by the  establishment  of  Local Advisory  Committees    closely connected with the Employment Exchanges.  Their period of activity before the    armistice was recognised as a preparatory stage for their fuller employment when demobi-    lisation began.  They were called upon to advise the Ministry on all matters calculated  to    increase the efficiency  of  the  Exchanges to which they  were attached.  During this    preparatory period they were asked also to deal  with such questions as the provision  of    substitutes for men to be released for service with the forces.   As regards resettlement,   &quot;their functions were necessarily restricted;  they were concerned in the  main with the    re-establishment in civil life of men discharged from the forces, who at that time were all    disabled.  Close relations therefore  were established with the  local committees of the    Ministry of Pensions,  and in many cases joint sub-committees were set up.  By the date    of the armistice, the organisation of the Local Advisory Committees was sufficiently com-   plete to allow of the rapid establishment of special sub-committees to. deal with questions   affecting women, and of trade panels, where necessary, to deal with  special  problems   arising in connection with various industries.   There are now in all some 270 Local Advisory   Committees, closely associated with an Employment Exchange,  or in some cases with  a   small group of Exchanges.       A rapid expansion of their work followed on the commencement of demobilisation.   They were called upon to assist the Ministry of Labour in the actual work  of demobilisation   by helping in the selection of pivotal men, and by endorsing the oilers of employment  &apos; made under the &quot; contract &quot; system  by those who wished to secure  the early release of   men who had&apos;been in their employment on  the  outbreak of war.   They were asked to   advise on, and to further the resettlement of disabled men, of demobilised members of*   the forces, and of women, as well as to continue their original  function of suggesting   improvements in the work of the Employment Exchanges.   They were called  upon also   to collect for  the guidance  of  the  Ministry information as to  local projects for pro-   promoting  employment,   and  as  to   factors  hindering the  readjustment  of  dislocated   industries, and  to act generally as ,local  centres of intelligence  and  publicity on behalf   of the Ministry.       It was seen, however, that the value of these local committees would be greatly in-   creased, and the work of the Ministry of Labour facilitated if, instead of reporting in all   matters direct  to headquarters, they were  brought under a  co-ordinating  authority   covering a wider area  than that  of the Employment -Exchange.  In  this  way  the   Advisory  Committees,  working simultaneously  on  problems  stretching  far  beyond   the limits of a single  area, would be brought into contact with one another without the   delay involved in reference to headquarters.  Inter-communication of knowledge and   opinion, and co-ordination of effort would become possible.  At the same time, by attaching   to these larger co-ordinating bodies a small official staff appointed by the Ministry of Labour,   many local difficulties  and grievances could be settled more  efficiently on the spot in the   light of  local knowledge,  and in such a way as to leave the central  organisation of the   Ministry at greater leisure to deal with the broader problems involved.  Divisional Councils   have therefore been established, one for each of six of the Employment Exchange Divisions   in England, two for the other the  South-Western Division one for Scotland, and one  for Wales, where there  are two standing Councils, for North and South Wales respectively.   The full Divisional Council comprises, almost invariably, two or three representatives selected  by each Local  Advisory Committee in the division.  To avoid, however, the difficulties  involved in working with so large a body, the full Divisional Council, as a rule, appoints from  among its members a Nucleus Council in whose hands its work normally rests.  In dealing  with subjects in wrhich some particular district or  industry  is  involved, the  Nucleus  Council summons to its meetings the representatives  on the full Council of such Local  Advisory Committees as  are concerned.  Attached to  each of the Divisional Councils is  a small official Secretariat appointed by the Ministry.   The Secretariat prepares business  for the consideration of the Divisional Council, and  in the interval between meetings of the  Council carries out the Councirs instructions.   The Secretariat has authority also  to deal  independently with matters not sufficiently important  to merit the consideration of  the  Council, and it is responsible for the liaison work necessary to maintain contact between  the Council and the headquarters of the Ministry.

                           PART III.-?PRESS COMMENTS.    (A) Labour and Socialist Press.  The Peace Conference and the Soviet Movements.    The views of the Labour papers on the problems before the Peace Conference, andtheir attitude towards the revolutions in Europe, cannot  be dealt with under  separatecategories ; the two are mutually interdependent.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and &quot; Forward &quot;both complain that the Entente diplomatists are living in a dead world of secret treaties and a disdredited diplomacy ; while they are busy with their schemes for adjusting frontiersand&apos; collecting tribute, there is  arising in Central and  Eastern  Europe a new League ofNations which bids fair to transcend the limit of frontiers or  cordons sanitaires.   Withthe new forces thus called into  being rests the determination of the future of Europe :  ifParis ignores them, it will find  itself stultified and side-tracked in the march of history ;if it tries to destroy them with bayonets and blockades it will hasten the  ruin of thecivilisation it claims to champion.   Such is the view of papers which, while gladly givingpublicity to disclaimers of Bolshevik atrocities such as the statements of Colonel RaymondRobin (late of the American Red  Cross Mission to Russia) before  a Committee of theU.S. Senate, are equally emphatic (at least in the case of &quot; Forward &quot;), in their condemn a-tion of the &quot; tyranny &quot; of the Soviet system in Russia.  The attitude of the &quot; Clarion &quot;is not widely divergent Bolshevism, it says, is the &quot; ill-begotten child of war and famine &quot; ;the way to stop its growth is to  kill its parents, not to form &quot; sanitary cordons  &quot; around it.Even the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; while it assumes that&quot; all decent people &quot; will concur in affixingto Bolshevism a series of emphatic epithets summed up in the word &quot; satanic,&quot; and extendsthe condemnation to the milder syndicalist movement of Western Europe and America,tempers its willing assent to an anti-Bolshevik crusade  in Russia by a caution againstthe unwisdom of making the peasantry tremble for the  security of their tenure of con-iiscated  lands.  The  &quot; Call&quot;  and  the  &quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought&quot;  naturally  go   much further, the former publishing  an article by Bukharin, &quot; Russian Peopled Commissary,&quot;maintaining that the Soviet system is the only true social democracy, the latter urging that every nerve should be strained to prevent the Powers from strangling  the nascentrevolutionary communities.   &quot;  Justice,&quot; repeating its  repudiation of Bolshevism as the    The appointment of  the  Divisional&apos;Councils was regarded in some instances withdistrust by Local Advisory Committees as likely to result in further delay in dealing withthe suggestions which they offered or the difficulties  which they brought to light.  Whilethe Local Advisory Committees are generally referred in the first place to the DivisionalCouncils, they are still left with the right of direct access to the  Ministry in matters  ofimportance.  The difficulties anticipated, however, have not been experienced, and it isgenerally  felt that  the co-ordination of  the activities of these bodies in the wider unithas proved a successful experiment.    The work of these bodies  has in the  main been advisory, but an interesting develop-ment has recently been made  by assigning to them definite administrative duties.  thus the Local Advisory Committees have been constituted the authority to which are referredapplications for an extension of the out-of-work donation in cases where the original periodof 13 weeks for which donation was payable has been exceeded.  In connection with thescheme  for the resumption of apprenticeships interrupted  by service with the forces, itis proposed to assign to them, in addition to the function of  advising on points of difficulty.arising under the various  schemes negotiated with Joint Industrial Councils or InterimReconstruction Committees, the power to give decisions through  their trade  panels  indisputes between individual employers and apprentices which do not involve  questions as to  rates of wages or the payment  of any allowance by the State.  In these cases thedecision of the. trade panel will  be final  and binding upon the parties  affected.   In thecase of  the Divisional Councils,  the main administrative function hitherto assigned, hasbeen that of  the application of the Retail Business (Licensing) Order, 1918.   The general administration of the Order lies in the hands of a member of the Divisional Council Secre-tariat, specially appointed for  that purpose, but cases in which, there is a doubt as to the advisability of granting a licence are to be determined by the Divisional Council itself.The Divisional Councils have in some  cases proposed  to delegate  their  authority  inthis matter to the  Local  Advisory Committee in the district, in  order that advantagemay be taken of the fullest local knowledge of the circumstances.
antithesis of sound social democracy as preached by Marx, Kautsky or Jaures, has little to say on the Peace Conference beyond a few pointed queries on the purpose of the visits to Paris of Messrs. Ramsay Macdonald, Henderson and Lansbury.  The &quot; Dreadnoughtreviles some of the. socialist journals for being content to exonerate England and America,as distinct from the other Allies, from their due share of blame for the continuance of theblockade and the delays of the Peace Conference.  In particular it takes the &quot; Herald &quot;to task for its ambiguous attitude with regard to Russia : if the Bolsheviks were induced,it maintains, to agree to a  peace such as the &quot; Herald &quot; suggests, accepting responsibilityfor the French debts, it would be an unjust peace, for these loans were among the lastprops of Tsardom and oppression.  It further anticipates that,  if the  Allies would offerfair terms and adequate guarantees, there would be no difficulty about keeping  our troopscomfortably in Russia as guests of the  Soviet Government till climatic conditions allowedof their peaceful removal.  An  event which evokes  much attention is the declarationof the Italian Socialist  Party rejecting the Berne International as a mere caricature ofsocialism, and offering its adherence to the revolutionary International of Russia.   Italy is consequently welcomed by the &quot; Dreadnought&quot; as the latest recruit to the  Bolshevistphalanx.    The &quot; Dreadnought &quot; is the only paper which comments at any length on the so-called&quot;Labour Charter1&apos; agreed to by  the  International Commission on  Labour Legislation.It remarks that it bears a striking resemblance to  the proposals adopted by the &quot; Govern-ment &quot; socialists at Berne,  and adds that the proposed Constitution of the General Confer-ence and the Governing Body of the International Labour Office  makes it always possiblefor the representatives  of  Governments and of employers  in combination to ensure thecomplete docility of the Labour representatives.   It calls on all true  socialists to boycottthe Institution.    The &quot; Call &quot; draws attention to the sinister implications which it believes to be in-volved  in the continuance  of Conscription in  England,  and the &quot; Big Navy &quot; policy inAmerica.                             (B) Other  Foreign Affairs.    Egypt and  India  again come in for considerable notice.  With regard to the formercountry, &quot; Justice &quot; quotes a  statement by Sir W.  Willcocks pointing out how we  haveforfeited the support  of the Fellaheen  by our oppression of them during the war.  The&quot; Labour Leader &quot; in an article by Dr. Haden Guest reinforces the same point and demandsthat a Commission with full powers of  public enquiry be sent there at once.  The exportduring the war of vast  quantities of wheat to the  Allies from India, when the country was herself  starving, is  arraigned in &quot; Justice &quot; ;  while the &quot; British Citizen &quot; publishesthis week the first of a  series of articles, in opposition to the granting of Home Rule toIndia, written by a contributor who claims inside knowledge on the strength  of contact with the native army during  the war.France.    The acquittal  of the  assassin of Jaures excites almost  universal comment andindignation.  &quot; Justice &quot; thinks  that the consequences may be disastrous;  the &quot; Call,&quot;on the other hand, rather welcomes it as a direct challenge to the whole Labour movementin France, and  only wonders whether the workers will pick up the gauntlet.                                 (Cj-Home  Affairs.Triple Alliance.    The temporary settlement of the threatened crisis  is taken as more  or less a faitaccompli, and comment  is mainly directed to the wisdom or unwisdom of the acceptanceof the terms of  settlement,  and to the wider political aims which the miners have  tackedon to  their industrial programme. The &quot; Call&quot; thinks the railwaymen gave in whenvictory was within their grasp.; the Government &quot; threat &quot; was mere bluff, and the unitedforces of the Alliance could not have failed to win if they had forced an issue.  With regardto the miners, however, it  believes that the magnitude of the concessions won will place them in a strong position to  fight the case for Nationalisation at an early date.  If this principle, it adds, has not been conceded by May, no power on earth will hold the miners in.  The  &quot;Labour Leader&quot;  applauds the &quot;wise decision&quot; of  the Triple Alliance  toaccept the prof erred terms, and  joins  with &quot; Forward &quot; in  deploring the sporadic strikes.which have broken out; the  &quot; Dreadnought,&quot; on the other hand, glories in the attitude.of the South Wales miners, and hopes they will  not  be inveigled into receding a single    (C 1739)                                                                 B
 step from the full claims of the charter propounded at Southport.   The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; publishes a statement by Mr.  Smillie  expressing great hopefulness of the future work of the Commission in improving mining conditions in general, and forecasting the consolidation and expansion of the Triple Alliance, especially with a view to increased political inter- vention in such questions as conscription and the release of political prisoners.  On this subject the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; adds that &quot; industrial action may yet become necessary to show the Government it cannot force legislation opposed by the overwhelming majority of the people,&quot; with the reservation that &quot; only in cases of exceptional aggravation could this course be justified.&quot;  The &quot; Clarion,&quot; however, thinks it is time a limit was set to the obstruction by minorities of the actions of the majority, whether it be a case of&quot; sectional &quot; action against the main body  of organised  labour, or organised labour itself against the political  community.  The &quot;British  Citizen&quot;  takes up  the  cudgels  for the  consumer, who had no representation  as such, it  says, on the Coal Commission;  in his interests the nationalisation of mines which as a business proposition  it condemns must  be regarded as of subordinate importance to the nationalisation of  the coal supply or, if this is unworkable, at least to the creation of a more economical system of distribution by the elimination of superfluous middlemen. Industrial Conference.   . Only three papers  make  any noteworthy  comment  on the Report issued by  the Provisional Committee of the  Industrial Conference.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  regards.it. as &quot; sadly inadequate &quot; and thinks the Appendix signed by the Trade Union representatives the most valuable portion.  The &quot; Call&quot; describes  it as &quot; pills for earthquakes &quot; and is glad the miners and railwaymen refused to be .&quot; side-tracked &quot; into the activities of the Conference.  It attacks the &quot;  inconsistency &quot; of the Trade Union representatives, who, after drawing up the drastic terms of the Appendix, subscribed, their  names to a report embodying  proposals  which fall  short even of  what is at present within  the grasp of organised labour, e.g., a 48-hour week, when the  proposal for a 44-hour week is now being . balloted on.   The &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks that, whatever the inadequacies of the Report,  &quot; it all helps.&quot; Food Control.     Mr. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot;  expresses his disappointment  and  disillusionment at the failure of the Government to sanction  the  proposals of the &quot; Consumers&apos; Council,&quot; especially with regard to the distribution of milk. Apparently, he observes, the Govern- ment is lending a sympathetic ear to the profiteering cry for the abandonment of control. Housing.     The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; points out how the necessity for paying high interest cripples all public housing schemes. Import Restrictions.     &quot; Forward &quot; deplores  the fact that only two  representatives of organised labourhave a place on the Committee dealing with this matter, and accuses the I.L.P. of slackness in permitting this.                              ,                  , The Land.     &quot; Justice &quot;  comments on  the  rapid disappearance  of  the tenant farmer, and  the suggested schemes  for agricultural co-operation  and the  elimination of  the commercial middleman.   Such measures, it owns, may help  to make the  industry  &quot; pay,  but from the  socialist point of view the important thing is not the margin of profits yielded by the industry,  but the amount- of food raised for the community. Income Tax Commission.  -  The &quot; Clarion &quot; welcomes the inquiry into what it regards as the injustice of assessing jointly the income of husband and wife. The only fair way,  it maintains, would be to take an average  of the two incomes and assess both husband and wife separately with the sum thus arrived at.  i.. Domestic Service. r-\J&apos; Justice &quot; publishes an article by Miss Jessie Stephens on the Report  of the Women&apos;s.Advisory  Committee  on the Domestic Servant Problem.

It is reported that the Bolshevist element which secured the vote of the South WalesMiners&apos; Federation against the Sankey  Report does not  control the  situation  in SouthWales.  There are signs that a considerable number of votes will be given for acceptanceof the Report.Railwaymen.    The Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen is taking steps to bring aboutarrangements with the craft unions for the purpose of ensuring the presentation of a unitedprogramme.    A further conference between representatives of the  Railwaymen&apos;s  Unions and theR.E.C. was held at the Board of Trade on Wednesday, the  9th April, to consider  questionswhich had not been covered by the recent settlement.&apos;Busmen.    An agreement has been drawn up between four London omnibus companies and theNational Transport Workers&apos; Federation,  covering motor-bus drivers and conductors.    The following are the main points in the agreement:     (1) 48-hour week 6 days of 8 hours.    (2) Is. 2d. an hour for drivers; lid. an hour for conductors.    (3) Average spreadover not to exceed 9 hours.   Maximum spreadover of 10 hours.

The agreement was  submitted to the Executive on 8th April, and will be submittedto the men for endorsement next week.    The ballot on the question of the amalgamation of the London and Provincial Unionof Licensed Vehicle Workers and  the Amalgamated Association  of Tramway and VehicleWorkers shows an overwhelming  majority in favour of the scheme.                                         7the Committee to accept more drastic proposals, she feels that from the point of view ofthe average employer the document will be regarded as &quot; revolutionary &quot;  The editorialcomment, however,  is that  only socialism, with  its reorganisation  of society and re-distribution of income, leisure and labour, can solve the problem.Other.    Dealing with the question of industrial control, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; remarks that&quot; the working man is no longer  bemused by such&apos; banalities as the condescending claim that Capital is a fellow-citizen when he used to proclaim himself Bang and Emperor.&apos;&apos; In thesecond of a series of articles in the same paper on &quot; Socialism and the Reward of Labour,&quot;Mr. Brace Glasier maintains that if the worker is merely fighting for the fruits of his ownunaided labour, he is struggling for less than he already possesses ; his  efforts should  bedirected rather towards obtaining his due share as a citizen in socially-created wealth.&quot; Justice &quot; has many criticisms to make on the policy of the Labour movement in England.The delegates at the Trade Union Conference on the League of Nations, it says, are beingrushed into ill-considered resolutions  on  subjects  to which they cannot have given dueattention, and these resolutions some of which are criticised in detail will go forth asthe voice of organised labour.  In a bitter attack  on Mr. J. H. Thomas it describes him as a man whose views no one really knows, and whom it is preferable in a crisis to have as an enemy than as a friend.  &quot; Justice &quot;  also has some interesting comments on theConference on Public Health held last  month at  the  Royal Surgical Institute.  Thediscussions there, it says, prove  on the one hand that the capitalist  classes are wakingup  to the fact that no class in the community can suffer without the whole communitybeing involved in the injury,  and on the other, that no fundamental  reform of publichealth  is possible under  the present economic system, because  no such reforms can  bemade to  &quot; pay.&quot;

The difficulties connected with the  arrangements regarding piece work rates which followed the introduction of the 47-hour  week  in  the engineering trades, have been thesubject of negotiations between the  A.S.E. and kindred organisations, including steamengine makers, united machine workers, tool makers, smiths and  strikers, brass-foundersand scientific instrument makers and the Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federation.An agreement embodying the following terms has now been arrived at:            &quot; Where by reason of the introduction of the 47 -hour week, a workman is not able to earn        on piece work his previous remuneration on the same job, the employers will undertake  to        recommend that suitable adjustments shall be made on the piece-work prices for that job.           &quot; It is agreed that piece-work prices should be such as will enable a workman of average        ability to earn at least 33^ per cent, over present time rates (excluding war bonuses).   Piece-        work prices once established shall not be altered unless the means or method of manufacture is        changed.           &quot; Meantime it is agreed that where prices are such that on account of the reduction in        hours the workman of average ability is unable to earn 33J- per cent., the necessary adjustment        should be made.&quot;Co-operative Societies.    The Co-operative Wholesale  Society announced on the  7th instant that they hadconceded a 44-hour week, without reduction of wages, to all the employees in their soap,jam, flour, margarine and printing works.   Over 9,000 workers are affected.  This con-cession will probably be extended to all employees, numbering about 80,000.    Lord Armadale has issued judgment  against the funds of co-operative societies being used to further  co-operative candidatures in politics, civic  or  national.   Co-operatorsstate that they intend to take energetic measures to secure the reversal of this judgment.Cotton Operatives.    The trade unions of the cotton trade  have rejected the employers&apos; offer of a 491-hour week, and a strike ballot is to be taken.   The employers have given the depressed stateof trade as their reason for not going further to meet the operatives&apos; demands.&quot; Russia &quot; and &quot; Conscription.&quot;    The Labour Party  Executive met on the 3rd April and decided to  approach theParliamentary  Committee of  the  Trades  Union Congress with a view to discussing themost prompt and effective  measures to be taken for the purpose of  carrying into  effect the miners&apos; resolution calling for industrial action to secure the withdrawal of troops fromRussia  and the dropping of &quot; Conscription.&quot; Prominent Labour leaders have expressedthe opinion that troops should be  withdrawn from Russia.Dyers and Bleachers.    The Amalgamated Society of Dyers  and Bleachers is taking steps to improve wagesand conditions of labour of the workers  of the trade  in London.   It is  alleged that thelow wages and poor conditions  prevalent in the metropolis give an unfair advantage to the London trade over Scottish competitors.Agricultural Workers.    Serious discontent among agricultural workers is reported from all  parts of thecountry.  The  workers are  dissatisfied with the  award of the Agricultural Wages Board.-(See Report for week ending the 2nd  April, 1919, p.  9.)Seamen and Chinese Labour.    The National  Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union are protesting against the employmentof Chinese labour on British ships so long  as British sailors and firemen are available  tomake up a crew.  The Union states that  it is determined to abolish cheap Asiatic labour.When  the unemployed British labour  is absorbed the Union will not prevent Chinesefrom sailing, but they must be paid the  national standard rate of   14 10s. a month forA.B.&apos;s and  15 for firemen.Asylum Workers.  . Representatives of asylum authorities met delegates of the National Union of AsylumWorkers on the 4th instant and discussed the workers&apos; national programme.    The authorities agreed to recommend the adoption of a working week  not exceeding
                                         ?! 60 hours, inclusive of meal times.  It was also decided that (1) meal times should not be less than 6  hours per week ;  (2) the 60-hour week should date from the 1st July next; (3) each member  of the indoor staff be allowed 14 days&apos; leave every six months;  and&apos; (4) in the event of resignation payments for any loss of leave be on a pro rata basis.     The question of wages is to be considered by the  Conciliation Committee, and the concessions granted will be retrospective as from the 1st April. Employers&apos;  Organisation.     In connection with the  Joint Industrial Conference set up by  the Government a movement has been inaugurated among  the  Employers&apos; representatives for  the estab-lishment of a new organisation to co-ordinate the activities  of the various Employers&apos; Associations dealing with labour matters.     The Federation of British Industries has decided to appoint a committee to consider the  Report of the Coal Commission and to continue to consider  its various Interim Reports; to consider the Report of the National Industrial Conference ; to take evidence from the various trades with regard to the question of nationalisation; to report back tothe  Executive Committee. The General Federation of Trade Unions.     The General  Federation of Trade Unions is publishing a new weekly newspaper  &quot;The  Democrat.&quot; The tendency of the new periodical is to be industrial rather thanpolitical.  It will  replace  the &quot; Federationist &quot; which was issued monthly. Boilermakers.     An agreement was reached on the 9th April in the negotiations between representatives of the boilermakers&apos;, shipwrights&apos; and blacksmiths&apos; societies and the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation  on the question of lieu and piece rates in connection with the introduction of the 47-hour week.   The terms of settlement will not be made public until after theyhave been communicated to the societies throughout the country.     It is reported that it has been agreed that the earnings  of the workmen are not to be adversely  affected  by the  reduction  of hours, that the  necessary readjustment ofpiece-work rates be settled by district conferences.                               Joint Industrial Councils. Reports on Councils.     Furniture. Difficulties have arisen in the furniture industry in connection with, thequestion of the 47-hour national week.  A committee held  on  the 3rd April failed toarrive at agreement.  The delay in arriving at a settlement is  producing a feeling on bothsides that little is  gained by having a National Industrial Council.                        i Waterworks Undertakings.     The first  meeting of the Joint Industrial  Council for Waterworks Undertakings washeld on the 3rd April.                                   Trade Boards.     Linen and Cotton  Embroidery Trade  in Ireland. The Trade Board has resolved toissue a proposal to fix general minimum piece rates for German embroidery on householdlinens, on the basis of present general minimum time rate of Z\d. an hour.     A Special Order dated the  1st April, 1919, has been made, applying the Trade BoardsActs to the laundry trade, viz., The laundering of articles of every  description and allprocesses and operations incidental thereto performed by way of trade or for the purposeof gain.     Metal Smallwares Trades. At a conference held during the  week the Trade union representatives expressed themselves in  favour of the  application of the Trade BoardsActs to this industry.   The employers&apos;  representatives, however, reserved their supportuntil they  knew  what action  the Government intended to  take to  prevent  thedumping in the English market of metal smallwares by foreign competitors.     Toy Trade. A conference has been  held with the employers&apos; representatives  whowere generally favourable to the establishment of a Trade  Board.  Great stress was laidby the representatives on the  damaging  effect  on the  trade of  foreign competition bysweated labour (especially from Japan).
                               (2) District Reports. London and South-Eastem.     Resettlement  of Women. The  London  and South-Eastern  Divisional Council has- received a report from its Women&apos;s Sub-Committee which has been considering the formation of  special Trade  Committees and the co-operation of employers&apos; associations and trade unions in the resettlement  of women in certain trades.  A scheme of training in mid- wifery, the  position of demobilised -temporary civil service clerks  and the prospects of the Wbmehs Land Army are also considered in the report. South-Western.     Unemployment and  Public  Works. Bristol City Council has appointed a  special&apos; committee to consider  unemployment and to suggest utility schemes, one of which would be  the construction of  a low-level&apos;road between the city and its port of Avonmouth. At the dock centres of Devonport and Portsmouth the Resettlement  Committee of the Local Advisory  Councils is working in close co-operation with the Municipal Employing Com- mittees.  Housing  schemes  are being pushed forward at Barnstaple,  Plymouth and Exeter.  The &quot; Western  Daily Press,&quot; however, reports (2nd  April, 1919) that a  memo- randum issued by the National Housing and Town  Planning Council expresses great uneasiness at the  &quot; slow return of men necessary in the earlier stages of  housing schemes.&quot;&apos; At  Falmouth it is proposed to ask the Coastwise Steamship Company to  resume its callings and to arrange a  service  of shallow steam or motor barges up the Eal to Truro.  The position of the mining industry in Cornwall is  serious, and it is  reported from Redruth that if immediate assistance is not  forthcoming a collapse is  feared.     Training Schemes  for Women. The resettlement  of unemployed women has  been occupying the attention of the Eastern Divisional Council of this area, where the problem is particularly acute in the greater Channel ports.  Training schemes for domestic service are in operation at Weymouth,  and are proposed for Bournemouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth.  A further suggestion is a short period of intensive industrial training with a maintenance  grant,  rather than  an  out-of-work donation.  In  view of the difficult situation at  Southampton and Portsmouth, Adult Female Unemployment Centres are advocated for these ports. West Midlands.     Employment. There is&quot;  a slight decrease  of unemployment  in Birmingham, where the Divisional Council has appointed a committee to discuss public  schemes with the Town Clerk.  A slight  rise of unemployment is reported from  Dudley and Coventry.  At Stoke, the pottery industry is said to be suffering from a shortage of clay, the import of which is affected  by transport difficulties.  The industrial situation in Stafford is note- worthy ; this boot and shoe centre is short of fine leathers for &quot;upper work,&quot; usually supplied from America but till now practically unobtainable.  Any quantity which may be released before  normal conditions are restored is to be rationed among the  various manufacturers by the Local Advisory Committee.  The Department has prepared reports on the probable effect  of German competition on the  Redditch needle industry, and on the prospects of brickmaking at Nuneaton. Northern.    Employment. More men are being  absorbed into  shipbuilding, but unemployment in engineering is still high.  Generally, shortage of coal and the  fear of American corn- petition are given as explanations of the depressed condition of the  iron and steel indus- tries, and this may cause  a rise in the unemployment figures for Hartlepool and Middles- brough.  Unemployment  is  considered  to  have reached  its maximum  on  Tyneside. Gateshead is  to push forward a large improvement scheme of street  and sewerage repairs and alterations.    The  Divisional Council is investigating  the condition of the paper manufacturing trade at Sunderland in  view of the removal of restrictions oh imports. In Newcastle the resettlement of women is a pressing problem, but unemployment in the binder twine industry on Tyneside is not likely to become worse.  The Divisional councils reporting on the dressmaking and millinery trades, and encouraging  a modification of domestic service whereby home workers will be supplied at a fixed charge per hour.  TheCouncil has before it two schemes for the employment of disabled  ex-service men onethe  opening of pottery works at Blyth, the other the training of  disabled men by individual employers in their own home area.
    Housing. Lack of  building material  is arresting the scheme  put forward by  theHartlepool Council for 500 houses, and the high price of land is given as the cause of thedelay in housing schemes at Stockton and Middlesbrough and in the  Cleveland district.    Hours. A movement is showing itself to abolish piece work and fix a guaranteed day or minimum time rate ;  the idea is likely to appeal to platers&apos; helpers, who often lose timebecause of the absence of the plater.   There are vindications that a 44-hour week agitationis gaining a hold among  the members of the Electrical Trades Union, the National Unionof General Workers, the National Amalgamated Union of  Labour,  the organised Black-smiths, Boilermakers and Shipwrights, and in the Teeside units of the Amalgamated society of Engineers.  Failing a 44-hour week, the tendency in the Middlesbrough area is to  put an embargo on all overtime and  repair work during meal-hours and week ends.  Theundertakers in the  area have decided not to conduct in future any funerals on Sundays.Yorkshire and East Midlands.    Employment. In the West Riding unemployment is affecting the cotton and woollenindustries most acutely.   The engineering trade is fairly well engaged, the clothing tradeis  exceptionally busy, and  at York  there is  a demand for workers in the  confectionerytrade.   In Sheffield, the cutlery and silver trades are busy ,and absorbing  a good manymunition workers  who  are  returning to  their pre-war occupations.   The demand for labour appears to be increasing generally.    Hours and Wages. After a trial period of  three months, the various employers&apos;federations and societies in Leeds decided to continue  the  existing  arrangement of  a47-hour week.  In  Sheffield, the two outstanding questions are the offer by the  Bone-Cutters  Association of a  12^ per cent, increase in their workmen&apos;s wages, and the  claim ofwomen workers affected  by the 47-hour week to be paid as for a 53-hour week.    Resettlement of Disabled $o^ers-Pontefract Local Advisory Committee is  pressing the questions of the disabled soldier and moving to establish locally such light industries as box-making, carpet making, tinning and enamelling, basket making, coopering,  andmat-making.North- Western.    Unemployment. There is a rapidly growing  volume of unemployment in the cotton trade, particularly in such cotton goods manufacturing towns as Burnley, Come, Blackburnand Padiham, and it is reported that the agitation for the removal of the embargo on export is passing &quot; from a commercial problem to a political crisis.&quot;  At a  mass  meetingof unemployed men and women at Bacup  on the 3rd April, resolutions were passed pro-testing against the reduction of the  out-of-work donation,  and the interval of six daysbetween the  first  and second periods.  Unemployment is also serious in  engineering;this is evidently due to  readaptation to  civil work and is therefore temporary, althoughthe non-release of plate  moulders from the army is mentioned as a subsidiary cause.  to cope with an undoubtedly serious situation, the Divisional Council  is taking steps tosecure the active co-operation and advice of influential members of employers&apos; federationsand trade unions.    It has been suggested that the  cotton rota system, which was terminated after thearmistice, should be revived, on the  principle that each industry should maintain its ownunemployed.   Under this system unemployment  was provided for by a small fine leviedon each spindle, and added to the cost of the product.  It is urged that  such a systemprovides a much needed incentive to push strongly for more work.Wales.    Employment. The Welsh Divisional Council is considering the prospects of the milford haven dry dock.   Unemployment is increasing at Bargoed, where attempts to set on foota laundry and basket and toy making industries were not successful.  The problem ofresettling the unemployed at Merthyr is peculiarly difficult, as mining is the staple industrythere, but attempts are being made to re-open the local brickworks and the CyfarthfaIronworks.   The  South Wales tinplate industry continues depressed,  under the threats of American  competition, and of industrial unrest which the establishment of a  whitley council is said to  have  done little so far to alleviate.  Steel works are fairly busy,  butare unable to keep their furnaces in full operation because of the shortage of raw  material and of gas coal.    Industrial Developments. Complaints against the Bute Dock Company are constant,and industrial firms are hampered,  and private  and public enterprise  retarded by the
 failure of the Cardiff Corporation and the Bute Authorities to settle terms of an agreement for the supply of electric power to the docks.   Port Talbot is expecting a rapid industrial development and is preparing a housing scheme in anticipation of the resulting  demand. The Welsh ports are still agitated  by the employment of non-European seamen; the district Committee of the National  Sailors&apos;  and  Firemen&apos;s Union at Cardiff threatens national action within a  month&apos;s time if Chinese  are not  replaced  by British  or allied workers at standard rates of wages.      Industrial Settlements. A conciliation board  is being  formed for the South Wales copper trade,  and employers  and workers in that industry have agreed on the terms of a 47-hour week.  The proposal to convert war  bonuses into wages is to receive attention shortly. Negotiations on the  working hours of tippers and  trimmers are proceeding to a satisfactory conclusion. Scotland.      Employment.-&apos;!!^ Scottish Divisional  Council reports that, contrary  to  popular opinion, there  is no evidence that apathy as to employment has been caused by  the pay- ment of donation.  Unemployment  is increasing among textile and  paper workers, and, in the flax and jute towns the system-of working only in alternate weeks is now general. The paper industry is evidently suffering  from the resumption of Scandinavian imports and from an anticipated fall in prices.  The starch works in Paisley are in a serious position owing to the fall in the price of feeding stuffs produced from  maize, and to  keen prices in the American market which defy  competition.  In the metal industries the unemploy- ment crisis is considered to be past.   Housing schemes are being generally pushed ahead, and in  the western districts of Moray and Inverness, timber-cutting  and saw-milling are reviving on the removal of government control.  The industrial situation in the  Western Highlands  lias been eased by the announcement  that the  Government has  taken  over the  Ballachulish slate quarries on a ten years&apos; lease, and two  proposed public works  of first-class importance the reconstruction of the Crinan Canal and a new main thoroughfare through the town of Dumbarton with a bridge across the Leven should further absorb labour from Argyll and Lome.      The main subjects occupying the local councils have been housing (at Stirling, Greenock., Wishaw and Inverness),  apprenticeship, and  schemes  of  domestic training  for women workers.                                PART V. DISPUTES.(a)  Involving a  Stoppage oj Work           The strike of the Dowlais miners, which began on the 3rd March, came to an end on the       7th April.  The principal cause of the strike, namely, the demand that the coal washery men       should be recognised as members of the Miners&apos; Federation, is to be considered by the Coal       Controller during the week.   The questions concerning the establishment of a minimum wage       and the new scheme for house coal delivery will be dealt with by the Coal  Board Disputes       Committee, and failing a settlement, will then be referred to the Coal Controller.           Over 1,000 quarry workers in  the Black Country struck on the 5th April because the em-       ployers refused to concede their demands for a 10 per cent, advance in wages.   The employers&apos;       offer to submit the dispute to the Whitley  Council for arbitration was refused.           Several hundred colliers in the Swansea Valley ceased work on the 5th April owing to the       introduction of demobilised soldiers into one of the pits.           A strike of 26 painters,  which has begun to extend to  other firms in London, began at       Messrs. Mellier, of Tottenham Court Road, on the 7th April.  The men are demanding that       the full increase to Is. 8d. per hour, demanded by the National Union of House and Ship Painters       early in the year, should be granted them.   Up to the present the employers have only conceded       an increase up to Is. 6d. per hour.           A strike of farm labourers for  2 10s. weekly wages, and a 49-hour week, appears to  be       spreading in Ulster.  The farmers say they cannot grant the men&apos;s demand, being bound  by       the decision of the Wages Board.  Strikes among labourers are also reported in Kerry and       Limerick.           Two thousand  Huddersfield tailors and tailoresses,  employed on wholesale work, struck       on the 9th April  They demand  18s. M. per week for men and 12s. Qd. for women, in addition       to all present wages and war bonuses.  The offers of employers have been rejected.
             The engineers  and firemen  employed on steam fishing vessels have  declared a strike at         Fleetwood because the owners  refuse to  grant  their request  for higher wages and a share         in the proceeds from the catches of fish.  The compromise offered by the employers was not         accepted by the men.((b) Not Involving a  Stoppage of Work             With regard to the operative bakers&apos; national demand for the abolition of work between         11 pan. and 5 a.m., it is stated that the employers have refused Government intervention on         the subject.  At a meeting on the 8th April between the employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives,         the employers passed a resolution suggesting that, on the repeal of the  12-hour old bread clause,         district meetings between employers and employed should be held to discuss how far local         conditions  will permit of a modification of night work.  This resolution has not been accepted         by the operatives&apos; representatives, but they agreed to place it before their Executive Council         on the 14th, April.             At Bradford and Swansea the Shop Assistants&apos; Union is making every effort short of         striking to prevent the Maypole Dairy Company from carrying out their proposal for extending         the shop hours.             Strikes of agricultural labourers are threatened in Shropshire, to secure a  12 o&apos;clock stop         on Saturdays,  overtime and  Sunday pay.   The Maghull (Lancashire)  branch  of the Workers&apos;         Union (Agricultural Section) have decided to boycott farmers  who  have not conceded an       &apos;  increase of  5s.  a week and a 54-hour week.  Workers are guaranteed similar work adjacent to        their homes at the increased  rate from other farmers.
