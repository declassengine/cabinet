&apos;1ECRET.   1^             V&apos;AR CABINET.G.T//00.1.    GUARANTEE OP CEREAL PRICES ? 1919 CHOP                             IhEI-APD-                   Memorandum by Mr. Ms cphe r s o n.        The enswer given on 19th jvov ember to a question, by Mi1,Lambert in   the House has led Irish farmers to believe that the 1918 maximum prices   for wheat, barley and oats were the guaranteed minimum prices for 1919.       &apos; Subsequent authoritative statements in the press amply confirm   this view, and I cannot see that any other construction can be put   upon it.        To make any change nos would imperil food production schemes in   Ireland by destroying, all confidence In the Department of Agriculture   and in the Corn Production Act.        The President of the Board of Agrioulture &amp; Fisheries, however,   proposes that the premise be amended as regards the oat crop and to   pay threfor on 2, or, at the most     quarters per acre.  Payment on   anything less than 5 quarters of oats per acre - the accepted average   yield per acre in the Corn Production Act - would be regarded by our  1 farmers as a distinct breach of faith.        In view of the very clear promise of the Government and the   disastrous effect which the proposed change in the guarantee would have,   I feel bound to press that the pledge be kept in full, for oats as well   as for wheat and barley.        It must further be borne in mind that the proposed change in the   guarantee, if made, would operate with special severity against Irish   and Scottish farmers, who are oat, rather than wheat, growers.        In this connexion the following figures indicate how Ireland   would be affected:-       Area under i each crop in J-9^ :  per cent                      England &amp; Wales           Ireland       Wheat   &apos;         &apos;                         8.2       Barley   ..         21,9                  9.5       Oats     . .         40.6...   .            82.2     In considering this important matter, which concerns fully400,000.farmers in Ireland, regard must also bo had to the present political circumstances of that country.     If.the Cabinet decide that the pledge must be modified,, an intimation to that effect should be made at once, as the resentmentcaused thereby will be intensified if  notification is delayed until after the crop is sown.     The Irish Department of Agriculture should be authorised at thesame time to announce that,, as the outlook regarding the supplies ofcereals and imported feeding stuff3, has improved, some relaxation of the Order requiring compulsory food production may now safely bemadeo   It would be quite impossible for the Department to enforcetillage - involving the further breaking up of grass land, except to a limited extent - if there Is any  variation of the guarantee .^                                           &apos; (Intd.)
