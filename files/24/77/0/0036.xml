-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government]/ U v y     y-7WPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1019.SEOili-T.        ^[42889]                    THE  EVACUATION  OF AKCHANGEL.    THE British  Commissioner at Archangel has  now  furnished  his views on  thesubject of the proposed evacuation of Archangel.    In Mr Lindley&apos;s opinion no difficulty is to be anticipated as regards the evacuationitself, which could be completed by the autumn provided a  reliable contingent, whichhe estimates at 3,000, could be landed at Archangel when navigation opens in June next,to act as a force to cover the retirement.    Mr.  Lindley estimates the numbers whom it would in all probability be  necessaryto bring away at no less than 18,500, made up as follows :      Archangel          9,000 russians         4.000 Finns, Poles, Esthonians, Letts, Lithuanians.        &apos; 5,000 locally enlisted troops now serving in British or French Legions.    Murmansk           500 inclusive.    As regards  the Finns, Poles,  and other nationalities of the Baltic States, thereshould be no difficulty in arranging for their ultimate repatriation to  their own countries,provided those countries have been able to  maintain themselves against the Bolsheviks *13,500 would accordingly be  the number for whom provision would have to be madeby the Allied Governments.    The question  of  the  attitude to be  adopted to  the - Provisional   Governmentpresents a more difficult problem.   In Mr.  Lindley&apos;s opinion His Majestys  Governmentare bound to give that Government fair&apos;warning, and he considers that if evacuation isto take place a notification should be conveyed to them forthwith.    There can be no question that such  a notification conveyed at the  present time would have  effects which would react  far beyond Archangel itself.  It could not  fail to  be regarded by  the  Russian  Bolshevik  Government as a  sign that the AlliedGovernments had definitely decided to abandon  to their fate those Russian  groupswith whom they have hitherto been co-operating,  and would correspondingly  discouragethose who are at present fighting the Bolsheviks in Siberia, South Prussia, and the baltic states.     While, therefore, evacuation may be justified as a purely military  measure, it is amatter, for consideration whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should make any announce-ment of their  intentions at the present stage.  Seeing the elaborate provision which itit  is proposed  to  make  as  regards  that part, of  the population  of  Archangel and murmansk which may elect to leave with the Allied forces,  there would seem to be no-reason why notification should not be deferred at least until the relief force was on  thepoint of arrival.   This would furnish a delay of two or three months, and events may by then  have taken a course which would  render the effect of the evacuation of Northern Russia less objectionable.     Mr. Lindley states that he is  unaware whether it is intended to evacuate as aresult of an agreement with the Bolshevik Government.   Any attempt  in this, direction would seem to be open to the  same objections as notification of the withdrawal to the Northern Provisional Government, and might be calculated to produce the same effect. In all the circumstances, if the evacuation must be effected, the best course would be to allow the preparations to go forward,  but  to defer an announcement on the subject for the present.     It does not appear that any decision has yet been come to as regards informing the Allied  Governments of the  views of His Majesty&apos;s  Government.  This  cannot  be deferred for long, seeing that  France,  the  United States, and Italy, all have troops in
IN                                        2Northern Russia.  When, and if these Governments  are informed of our  intentions, itis suggested that they should be made acquainted with the commitments  which will be involved as regards the evacuation of Russians and others who  may  desire to leavewith the Allied forces, and should be asked to bear their share in making the arrange-ments for providing for the needs of the refugees.    I  have written  the  above  on the assumption  that  the  policy of  evacuation isproceeded with, but am not quite clear in my own mind whether the War Cabinet  has arrived at a final decision.                                                                      C. OF K.    Foreign Office, March 25*- 3 919.
