[This Document is the Property of His  Britannic Majesty s Government.     THE  Italian  Parliament  reassembled on the  1st  March  for  a  short  session. Proceedings opened with the Governments &quot;declarations.&quot;  Signor Orlando&apos;s speech. (of which  the more  important passages are given in  Appendix I) dealt first  with internal and economic affairs, and then, after an appeal to the Italian people  to  keep itself clear of Bolshevism,  went  on to deal  with the Peace Conference and Italian claims.  The  first  part was chiefly retrospective  and extremely vague, making no mention of the matters in which members were  chiefly interested, such as financial arrangements, State monopolies, and, in particular,  electoral reform.  It was coldly received in all parts of the House, and it is  rioted that even &quot;the Presidents most loyal supporters made no attempt to defend him from the derisive interruptions of the official Socialists.   The reference to Italy&apos;s  claims,  and especially to Fiume, in the second part of his  speech, was the first and only point  which evoked enthusiasm.  The rather cryptic definition of the Governments interpretation of Italy&apos;s rights can have satisfied no one.  In the course of the discussion which followed  foreign affairs were treated of by several  deputies.^     Theodoli  (a Moderate Liberal)  discussed Italy&apos;s treaty  rights in Asia and Africa. He referred to the agreements concluded in 1914 between France, England, and Russia, attributing to  these Powers certain zones of  influence in Asia Minor, which agreements, according to M.  Briand, were to be laid before the  Peace Conference.   He feared that France would thus gain  an advantage.   There  was another agreement, he said, between France and England as regards Togoland  and the  Cameroons,  and according to a previous agreement between the two Governments the  division between them  of these districts would be a permanent one.  These  arrangements, he  said, brought into force article 13 of the 1915 Treaty  of London,  providing compensation to  Italy in case of such division.   The speaker asked  the Government whether  the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs had been informed of this agreement,  and at what date, and what  it had done to remedy the obvious injury to Italian interests involved in her exclusion ; further, whether it was true  that  the Italian Government  was informed by  their consular agents in the East that the work of delimiting the respective spheres in  Asia Minor  by England and France had been begun, and  that, in  reply  to  our inquiries, the Allies  had  replied,  denying the existence of any  arrangements between  them regarding Asia Minor ?   As  to the system  of mandates, he claimed that  Italy should receive a mandate over a zone of territory proportionate to the position she had earned for herself in the Mediterranean.   Apart from  AdahV, Italy must have Armenia minor, that is to say,  Adana  and  Mersina,  which had never been  Arab, and  formed part of Cilicia;  if Alexandretta was claimed by France,  Mersina  must  in compensa- tion be assigned to Italy.  A mandate for Armenia would not be sufficient unless  it comprised the whole region, along with its  outlets  on the Mediterranean.    Labriola  (Independent  Socialist), in the part of his speech which  touched on foreign affairs, while applauding Theodoli&apos;s speech, differed from him with regard to Armenia,   which country,  he said,   was  quite ripe lor  complete independence,  and should not  be  under,any mandatory.  He regarded the League of Nations as in reality a league of the victors against the vanquished, and showed that he shared Theodoli&apos;sfears as to  French ambitions.   He foresaw  that  the  world was  going  to be  divided into  two groups,  the strong nations and the weak, and feared that Italy would  find.herself in the latter.  r  Bevione created something of  a stir by  reading a confidential  memorandum,written and sent to London by l)r.

Austro-Hungarian fleet.  He characterized the document as a betrayal of the Pact of rome, and claimed that the extravagant pretensions of Jugo-Slavia, as laid before thePeace Conference, had  happily united  Italian  opinion.   In the latter part of his speech lie defended the claims of Italy in Asia Minor, and  asserted that  the Pact  ofLondon was a proof of  the foresight and moderation of Baron Sonnino.             &amp;     It had been expected that  the  question  of electoral reform  would have been  atleast mentioned  in the declarations  of  the  Government.   The question  bad  been largely discussed during the last few months in the  press, and reform, in the sense of larger constituencies with several in place  of single members, scrutin de liste  with.R., has  been  demanded by  influential sections  of  nearly  all  parties Socialists,Reformists, Radicals,   Republicans,  Liberals of the Right, and the  newly-formedCatholic party.  A motion  embodying  proposal for reform  in the  sense  described above was introduced on behalf of the inter-party coalition by Turati, the  leader  ofthe  Official Socialists,  on  the  6th  March.  He  urged that the country had to choose between a reformed Parliament and the Soviet.  Signor Orlando&apos;s reply was  lame andembarrassed.   Reform  would  mean  delay in the  elections.  The present  Chamberwas not the right body to decide so  important a question, and so on.   He moved thatthe discussion of Turati&apos;s motion be postponed for six months, making it a questionof confidence.   On the  division,  which  was by roll-call,  the Government gained amajority of 114 (243 ayes to 129 noes).   The Catholic party (with the  exception  ofSignor  Meda, the  Minister  of  Finance) and the Official  Socialists  voted  solid  for reform ; other parties were divided. &apos;     Signor Nitti  intervened in the  discussion,  saying that he should  vote  for theGovernment because, at a -moment when the very life of the country was threatened byinsidious dangers, it was every man&apos;s duty to support the Government.  He went on topaint a very gloomy picture of the economic and financial condition of  Italy, and endedby expressing his  own personal conviction that if Italy could survive the  difficulties ofthe next two or three years she would become one of the richest countries in Europe.The Nationalist paper, &quot; LTdea Nazionale,&quot; represents  his  conduct as a ridiculouslyobvious attempt to place himself at the head  of a Giolittian-Socialist majority, and theGovernment in  the position of his debtor and  dependent;. it accuses him  of apeingGiolitti &quot; Signor Nitti, speaking from the seat usually occupied by Signor Giolitti. andwith Signer Falcioni seated next to him, attempted to reproduce in  relation to theOrlando Ministry  the situation created by Signor Giolitti  in relation to the  variousinterim Governments which in  the  course of  his long dictatorship were  entrusted byhim to his various pro-consuls.&quot;     The object aimed  at  by the  Reformists is  that of making  more  difficult themanipulation of elections, and of freeing deputies from the tyranny of their constituentsand of petty local  interests.   A majority  of the  Chamber, it seems, was  in  favour  of reform, but the question of confidence  having been raised, many members feared thatthe  consequences  of a  defeat of the  Government were, in view of the  international situation with the decision.of Italy&apos;s claims just coming before the  Peace Conference, too great to be risked.  The   Times&quot; correspondent quotes in regard  to  the voting &quot; thecomment  of one  well-known  publicist,&quot;  to  the effect  that &quot;it was clear that theGiolittians had agreed to take part in the Government on condition that electoral reformwas shelved.&quot;  The boast  made by &quot;La Stampa&quot; that the old majority, which hadsaved the Government on previous occasions, would  again come to its rescue,^ seems tobear out this supposition.     On  6th March the Minister of Finance introduced a Bill  abolishing  the  threeexisting direct taxes and fusing them in one income tax, with rates graded according tothe nature of the income.     On 8th March the Chamber adjourned till 3rd April,  in  order to enable thePresident to return to Paris.    * &quot; Once more, if this danger arises, wlat was before the war the Parliamentary majority will intervene to save the Government, to rescue it from the concentrated fire of the Socialists and the men of the Fascio atpiesent united on the ground of Electoral Reform.&quot;-(&quot;La Staiiipa,&quot; 3rd March ).
APPENDIX I.                    EXTRACTS EROM SIGNOR ORLANDO&apos;S SPEECH.                                  Demobilisation     THE difficulties of the situation are without precedent.  The Government has madeevery effort to meet them.  Meanwhile it has proceeded, and is proceeding, to demobilisethe army, and this at a rate not surpassed in any other State.   The procedure is  basedon the objective principle of the order  of classes modified by release on a large scale ofcertain categories of workers and producers  whose help is most urgently required forthe restoration of normal conditions of life.  Altogether 1,700,000  men  have  been restored to civil life.                              The. Peace Conference.     [After an explanation of the apparent slowness of procedure.]     And yet, in spite of these difficulties, the first phase of the Conference comprisedwithin a period of  less than one  month, succeeded in  ordering all  the vast mass ofmaterial with which it  had to deal, in distributing  the  work between  a number  ofspecial commissions ; in hearing  from  the  actual representatives  of  the  peoples oralstatements of their chief aspirations, and in undertaking the researches necessary for establishing the principles of an  equitable  solution ; so  that, within  a second period,which  will probably not be longer than the first, it is in a position to  have all the dataof all the questions sufficiently worked  out.   It is not therefore too much to hope thatit may be possible to fix the cardinal points of the Treaty of Peace within a third period,which  the  latest  news  from Paris warrants us  in saying will be entered upon imme-diately, and will be of the shortest possible duration.    1                     The League of Nations  Convention.     [People criticised the draft of the Convention, but to  those who knew the difficulties and the irreconcilable oppositions the  surprising thing was that something more thana paper Utopia had been achieved. j     How often has not  the  attempt been made to set up High Courts of InternationalJustice ?  But  when it  came to imposing  them, State sovereignty rightly saw in the 1institution an intolerable limitation, and  a Court which had no power of  enforcing its decisions remained a lifeless body.     The essential novelty in the  new Statute of the Peoples consisted, however,  in itshaving substituted for the passivity of  non-obligatory justice a positive and continuousactivity which obliges all  peoples and all States to turn their collective attention to thegreat problems connected with  international life, and consequently with  international peace,  and  to subject them to discussion, to criticism, to the control of public opinion-and all this based on a solemn assurance mutually given  by the members of the society of Nations pledging each to abstain from any form of unjust violence.     In this way I  think a new era.....a  happier and  safer era may be  dawning for the peoples of the world, in which maintenance of  peace shall depend  not so much onabstract  principles and  formal judgments  as  on a whole complex  and  continuousactivity, relying not only and not so much on material force as on checks and controlsexercised by spiritual forces whose  influence is daily growing and spreading.     Italy is the more glad to have been able not merely to accept, but  actively and notineffectively to  co-operate  in the affirmation of this new spirit, demanded by the feeling of all countries, inasmuch as she feels and knows that every one of her particular aims and aspirations conforms strictly with the principles of the most rigorous justice.                              The Mandatory System.     Italy, who can with legitimate pride claim for her people a high degree of civilisa-tion,. has  demanded and has been acknowledged the right to make  her contribution  tothis work of;international civilisation.   (Comments.)&apos;  .                                Italy&apos;s  Claims.,-t.   And  finally, as regards her national  aspirations,  Italy  has  believed, and stillbelieves,  in their complete justice, since, while she asks no more, she cannot admit less-than this to reunite with herself landg  and peoples Italian by glorious tradition, and       [1130]-382                         &apos;                &apos;  *          B 2
 to include them  for her own integrity and  protection within the  confines fixed by nature herself (hear, hear !), thus rendering herself the country most clearly defined as regards boundaries and the most homogeneous in population of all Europe.  (Loud and general applause.)      Precisely because conscious of her rights, Italy is not blind to that limitation which goes with every right: the limit at which one&apos;fi own right touches that of other people&apos;s.  (A Member :-&quot; Where is that? &quot;   Laughter.)      Not having been impelled originally by motives  of interest, and undisturbed at the present time by resentment of extravagant pretensions, Italy has always recognised the necessity  for harmonising in  a just compromise her own  needs with those  of others, and for not insisting on her own interests regardless of the essential needs of other peoples.  And it was the spirit&apos; of compromise which was embodied from the beginning in that treaty, by which Italy on her entry into the war  intended nothing else than to obtain from her Allies a solemn recognition of the extensions that must be given  to  her  national rights a character of compromise tangibly revealed by the very renunciations which that treaty contained, and whose importance is to-day being so keenly felt  by all of us.  In spite of that, we remain faithful to the conciliatory spirit by which that document was inspired.  That, however, does not me,an  to say that  Italy can remain  insensible to  the  appeal which  comes  to her  from  that superlatively Italian city, the jewel of the Quarnero  (cries from all parts of the Chamber of &quot; Viva  Fiume!&quot;   General applause Deputies  rising  to  their  feet),  which throughout  the ages  has   proudly&apos; maintained  both  its national  character and its political independence, but at  the present moment would seem to be in  danger  of losing both the one and the other.  We cannot believe that to be possible at a moment when it is desired to rescue the world from the record of violences done to the rights of peoples.  And in spite  of difficulties, of which the Italian Government  must  take impartial account, we  are  persisting in  the full defence of our rights, without  blind intransigence, but at the same time with resolute  firmness.   These rights have  been consecrated  by the incalculable sum -of  sacrifices and hardships endured by the whole people ; they have been sanctified by the hundreds of thousands of Italians who  have died in the cause of  justice.   They, desired justice  for the world, and&quot; they desired justice for their  own country ;  and these two  ideals coincide  harmoniously  in the serene  and   unshakable affirmation  of the rights  of Italy.   (Loud  and general^applause.)APPENDIX  II.     SPEAKING in the Senate on the .10th March, the ex-Minister for Foreign affairs and ex-Ambassador jin  Paris,  Signor Tittoni, expressed  complete distrust  of  themandatory system which a French jurist had  described as disguised cession.   &quot;Thisold formula,&quot; he said, &quot;cannot be rejuvenated by the rouge of a League of Nations.&quot;Ho dwelt at length with the economic aspects of the peace settlement, and with Italy&apos;sneed  of  raw materials  and markets.   Speaking of newspaper  reports concerning theallocation of mandates, &quot; Great Britain,&quot; he said, &quot; will have a mandate for mesopotamia and Palestine, France  that of Syria, and America that of  Armenia, whilst Italy  willhave a mandate over the country between Armenia and the Smyrna region assigned to greece.  In Africa England will  have a mandate for German  East Africa, France forthe Cameroons and Togoland, and Italy-nothing.  There is not a word about the adriatic.&quot;    Turning to the Adriatic,  he  urged that the question should  meet with a speedysettlement, so  that they might at last no longer behold the unworthy spectacle  of a portion of the Austrian army, which,  after having long  fought against Italy  andiDarbarously devastated her invaded  territories, was-now re-forming  under anothername, but with the same arms and soldiers and the same generals.  (Cheers.)     Signor Tittoni endeavoured to show the absurdity of the arguments of some foreignnewspapers, to the effect that recognition of Italian rights in Asia and Africa could not take place unless Italy renounced a part of her rights in  the Adriatic, or vice versa.V We went into the war,&quot; he said, &quot; with the assurance that all these rights would be equally safeguarded, and  the  sacrifices we had to make, even without counting themoney spent, were infinitely more painful than we had foreseen.  In Asia Minor weshall  have the country between Armenia and  Adalia, but without the  Aidin  district,
and they want to give us the rocks of the Taurus and the desert of  Konia without the plain of Mersina and Adana, the  only fertile one.   Nothing is  said about Heracleia,where there  is  a coal-field,  which is an absolute necessity for us.  We had been promised compensation in Africa  if the Allied Powers acquired all or a part  of  theGerman colonies, but these compensations  cannot be withheld from us.   If  these colonies  are  occupied  by a  mandate of the  League of Nations we cannot contentourselves with our old  colonies without  their commercial hinterland.&quot;  He concluded by expressing his unaltered confidence in the fairness of the Allies, the firmness of  theItalian delegates, and italy&apos;s faith in the holiness  of her  rights.
