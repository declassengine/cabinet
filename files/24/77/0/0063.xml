I               I                        OFFICE&apos; ACCOMOpATIOH.          Memorandum, by t ha J llgt^pmmi 2g practitioner of Jerks,G-.T*7^39      /     In reference to the memoranda by   Lord Curzon, &quot;  J026     ALord Inverforth, and J*Lord Irr-le, I- must point out that &quot;  6664     this whole question of aoeommcStation dipsn&amp;g essentially            upon the numbers of staifa in  the various Departments, now            in the occupation of premises  in possession of the Govern-            r. e r. t.  I have been e n de a v 0 u r i n g for a 10.0. g t i&apos;rh e past to            obtain from various Departments their probable reduction of            staffs and the dates which they can evacuate buildings.            The replies I have received on the whole have afforded me            very little assistance, and the reductions in staff, with            tho exception of the Mini.3cry  of Munitions and the Hinistry            of Food who have considerably  reduced their staff, axe            small.  There is no accommodation of any kind at present            vacant, or likely to beecms vacant in the near future  in            the Whitehall area, to enable  the demand&apos;? now put forward            in these memoranda, to be met.  To deal with tho memoranda            seriatim,                  1.  OVERSEAS TRADE EEPARflMBNT,  It has always been            impossible to requisition for  this Department, which  is            not a war Department, and in any  case, I cannot imagine the            War Cabinet would wish me to requisition now, nor are  there            any premises in  the Whitehall  area of a suitable  character &apos;            which would enable me to recommend such a stop being  taken.            A proposal was put forward some time ago, during  the war,            to erect temporary building a outside the Foreign  Office.            At the time, this proposal was rejected on the ground of            the want of material, and. insufficiency of labour, which of            course to-day do not exist.  .  Such a scheme can be carried            out now if the Cabinet so decide, but, personally, I would            strongly urge that the expenditure of more public money on            office accommodation ior a1 Department which is housed  already^&apos;            would evoke vary strong&apos;public criticism and it certainly            does net appear  to me justifiable.   There is also the            further serious  question of blocking up the Horse Guards            with buildings and its possible interference with&apos; the            military ceremonials usually held there in peace  times.                  The suggestion that the  War Trade Intelligence            Department Building in St. James1 Park could be utilised is            impracticable, as although the staff of that Department is            diminishing it now numbers 266, and it is understood  that            its further diminution is dependent on decisions  to be            taken at the Peace Conference, particularly as to the            raising of the Blockade.   Recently all the available  opaoe            in the building  was allocated  to  the Passport Office  of            the Foreign Office who were in urgent need of additional            accommodation which had to be  provided in the immediate            vicinity of the  Foreign Office.
2.  BOARD &quot;OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.      1 fully sfeare the feeling of Lord Ernie regarding the difficulties under which he and hia Department labour, in having their cf &quot;ices apl.lt up, in so many sections.  I however regret that I cannot see how Armament Buildings can be released until the future accommodation cf the Ministry of  uppliea is disposed of* I have obtained from the B*ard of Agriculture, ah estimate of its post-war staff, whitfh I understand. &quot;-ill number 1650 and which is bO% in excess of the pre-war staff.  Of thia number 1250 will be Kead-QuartersJ Staff requiring aocemmodaticn in Whitehall, whilst Arma.ment Buildings will not accommodate more than 900. -   3.  MINISTRY OF SUPPLIES *      In regard to Lord Inverforth1s memorandum,there are no buildings available or in. ^xisirence in possession of the Government to house his staff of 2500., Lord Inverforth!s Department ia now housed in the Hfttel Metropcle and Armament Buildings.   The. Far Cabinet Committee on Accommodation has been^considering the &quot;po&quot;3sibility&apos; cf finding &quot;r&quot;0&quot;om for the Head-Qua?t * mStaf f e  the Ministry of Supplies in the New Public Offices now oocupled by the.Local Government B^ard, the Board of Education, the Off ice of Works and the Controller tf the Navy, and I hope to be In a position to. submi.  shortly a report on this question.  There certainly is.np possibility of finding room for a staff of such magnitude  in th&amp;se&quot;buildings even if other, accommodation Is obtained for the Controller of the Navy,  whose  Department,  1 may state, 13 a  permanent one.   The main Admiralty Wilding  Is am^eady very overorowdod.      The fact has tp. be  faced  that  the creation of so many ,new&apos;Departments  with:very large staffs  has produced a&apos;crisis  in the&apos; whole., question of; Government accomm^ation. The question of permanent accommodation for these ;v- partments ^ill require an early decision.   I have been going Into,this matter with my teohnioal experta and examining various alternative  proposals.  The  question of prinoiple, which,  It  seems  to  me,  should be  decidea,  is, now far the advantage of concentrating ataffb  of D^part- ments in  one building outweighs.the difficulties oi- providing accommodation  in the Whitehall area,. which,, is limited,  and very expensive. &apos;  Further, whether  the prln- ciple of  Head-Quarter staffs remaining in the Whitehall area and  the les3 important sections  of the  department being housed in areas further  away  from the  centre, should^ bo adopted.   I have had  prepared a  preliminary  scheme for X utilising.the&apos; Crown Property between the Board  of Trade Offices and fdchmond  Terrace.   I find by fully  utilising the site,  it vo  uld Y,e possible to  erect office accommodation of  a modern character, for some 23,COO staff. It would  probably take four years to carry  cut, and a rcugh estimate of the co8t  is  given, as four  million pounds apart from the land which Is however Crown  Property..   I feel convinced that some such  scheme  will have  to be  under- taken,  and the sooner the  better.   In spite  of  the large expenditure,, it would be more  economical than  the continual Hiring of premises..   1 propose,  ^&quot;ith Tar Cabinet authority, to go into this cremation  in  full detail.      I  could respectfully point, out. that the Far, Cabinet has delegated questions  of  h accommodation to  the FarCabinet
    flaibinet Committee on Accommodation, \hich is in con-&quot;tinuous and close touch &quot;ith all the difficulties and matters arising from : tne demands for accommod..tion fromall quarters. - The question of accommodation is one of detailed complexity, and cannot bo dealt -ith piecemealIn conclusion, I uould submit that no stepsbe at presenttaken regarding the. three memoranda submitted., as the &quot;holeof these and other contingent questions is receiving the constant attention of the Y&apos;ar Cabinet Gcmimittree- pn AccAmimodai^rri,-(Inod.)    \.M.H.MV office of Forks,&apos;      Storey1 s Gate, S^M.             28th March, 1919.
