SUMMARY. PRANCE.                                                      *    The recent decision of the Confederation Generate du  Travail  to collaborate with  the  Socialists and the Ligue  des  Droits de 1&apos;Homme is in effect a concentration of the Left against the Right iu the struggle for supremacy between the Freethinkers and the  Catholics.    The extremists, realising that as long as Jouhaux led the C.G.T. the organisation was useless from their point of  view, amended  the statutes of  that body daring  the  recent  National Congress so as  to  make  it impossible for members  of  the  Confederal Committee to  hold  auy administrative function for more than a single year. BELGIUM.    The discontent still lingering amongst  the working  classes is due  to the steady increase in the  cost of living and  to the delay in passing the Bill for  an  eight hours  day.   Industrial  depression  in  many staple industries is  having  a marked effect  upon  labour,  but the  threatened increase of unemployment renders strikes of  importance unlikely for the moment.   Broadly speaking,  the  effect  of Communist  influence  is negligible. ITALY.    The past  two  months have been marked by a general reaction against extreme doctrines, and the power of the Government to deal with revolu- tionary matters is reported to be on the increase.    The Italian Government is doing its upmost to  help d&apos;Annunzio  to retire with dignity from Fiumeand from the position in which the Treaty of Rapallo has placed  him. SPAIN.    The metal workers1 strike  and terrorist campaign in Barcelona have come to  an end.   The terms upon which the  men returned  to  work constitute a complete victory for the Government. NORWAY.    The cost  of  living,  heavy taxation,  and  other hardships of the professional classes are causing considerable discontent with the existing regime.   The bourgeois and farmer classes, though opposed to Bolshevism on  the  Russian model, are reported to  be far less sound  than theyformerly were. SWEDEN.    Business in Sweden is  reported  to be  almost  at a  standstill.  Thecreation of a Bolshevik  Exchange Bureau in connection  with  thecommercial bureau of  the  Soviet Government is under  consideration  in stockholm.DENMARK.    The Left  Socialist party has resolved to accept the 21 points of theThird International, and has adopted the title of the Danish CommunistParty.

The recent Congress showed a poor spirit, and adherents to the party, finding they had been deceivedin the  inflated promises  of their leaders, no longer take them at theirword.GERMANY.   German Independent Socialists feel that a trial of strength betweenthe Monarchists and the Spartacists is  impending.  The danger is mostacute in Bavaria, where the policy of  the Monarchists is  to stir up  theworkers first and  to start a Putsch from  the Right, ostensibly for thepurpose of restoring order.   The decision  of the German Independent Party at the Congress atHalle to adhere to  the Third International was  by no means representa-tive  of the feeling of the party.   The recall to Moscow  of Kopp, the Soviet representative in Berlin,is regarded as certain.SWITZERLAND.   Swiss Socialists particularly object to the three points in the ThirdInternational requiring  affiliated  organisations  to remove  followers ofReformist and Centrist tendencies, to purge the  party periodically,  andto eject all members refusing the conditions laid down by the CommunistInternational.AUSTRIA.   Failing financial assistance on the part of Great Britain and America,the economic position in Austria seems hopeless.   The financial problemstrengthens  the  Anschluss  movement, which continues unabated  andwhich  credit from Great Britain and America would probably go far to destroy.RUSSIA.   The Supreme Economic Soviet Council of Russia has  issued a decreepointing out the general principles on which foreign capitalists may be permitted to exploit the natural riches  of the  country.   There is, how-ever, confirmation from various quarters of  the  dilatory and insinceremethods of the Soviet Trade Delegation abroad.    Krassin  has  written  a letter to Ropp expressing alarm at a Berlinscheme for sending technical experts to Russia.   An account is given of soviet intrigues in the Orient.LITHUANIA.   The Lithuanian  Government has  recently shown  signs  of  closer relations with Soviet Russia.POLAND.   An internal economic crisis and the danger  of  complications  withRussia render the general situation in Poland disquieting.BULGARIA.   Bourgeois parties deplore and even resist the anti-capitalistic measuresof the Government, while the Communists attack the administration onthe ground that it encourages profiteering among the peasantry.
CANADA.   Canadians boast of having  fewer labour troubles than any nation inthe world, a fact for which prosperity  during the past year probablyaccounts.SOUTH AFRICA.   The parties in South Africa tend  more and more to  be ranged inopposite ranks.  The Nationalists&apos; attack on the Constitution is a danger to peace.AUSTRALIA.   Diversion of the copra trade from Australia and  Great  Britain to america is causing both anxiety and discontent.UNITED  STATES OP AMERICA.   The Government is expected  to impose  stringent  conditions on the admission of aliens shortly after the assembly of Congress.   Ludwig  Martens,  the Soviet representative in America,  has  been requested  to  leave the  country, and only  delays his  departure pendinginstructions from his Government regarding the lodgment of an appeal.   There has been a final cleavage in  the ranks of the Irish agitators inthe  United  States.   The Oriental question occupies  the forefront ofpublic interest, and the Hindu  is reported  to he nearly as unpopular inCalifornia as the Japanese.
CONFIDENTIAL.A  Review  of  Revolutionary Movements  in                  Foreign Countries.PAET I.                   1. LATIN COUNTRIES.                            FRANCE.General.   The social stability of the French ami the unique  capacity shown byFraftice to cope with labour difficulties as they arise is attributable&apos;in nosmall degree to the strong and, ou its worse side, rapacious individualismof the peasantry.  The system  of  peasant holdings instituted and madepermanent by the Napoleonic code  has engendered a fixed and conserva-tive  love of the soil in great  sections of tho French population.  this applies now not only to the dwellers  on  the soil themselves ;  men cometo the towns imbued with the sentiment for and love of the earth char&amp;c-teristic of  the small-holder, and these feelings to a  great extent nowpermeate all professions and all layers in French society.   The sentiment of ownership is therefore firmly fixed  in the Frenchmind aud  carries with  it a natural  antipathy to  men who have becomeuprooted.   The refusal of the peasantry and of those associated with themby sentiment to support the  deracines of  the  workshops and of  therevolutionary  labour  organisations  was  largely  responsible  for  theGovernments victories over  the  railwaymen  and  the  ConfederationGeneral du Travail in the  spring.  Virtually the peasantry said  to the strikers, &quot; If you refuse to work and carry our produce we shall see thatyou yourselves will be the first to suffer,&quot; and the Government, relying Ontne solidarity of agrarian opinion, was able to deal with what, to judgefrom the temper of the workmen alone, had all the  appearance of au uglysituation.                                               -   The Confederation  General du  Travail and the Socialist Party have recognised this.  In their recent joint campaign against military support to the anti-Bolshevik forces operating from the Crimea, nationalisation ofthe large estates was promised to  the peasant classes as the reward oftheir concurrence.   Promises were  also made that  small holdings workedby the owners would be respected  in the general campaign of propaganda,and  it wa; emphatically contended  that the movement was for the relief of the Russian people and not for any support of the Third International.    Free-thinkers and Catholics, the two great parties  which for the past50 years  have contended  for  the direction of  France, are  once  morestaking their all upon their  colours.  The Catholics are in the  majority in the Chamber of Deputies, but in a minority in the  Senate.   The&apos;  twoChambers  are  consequently opposed, and,  as each  is immovable, and neither can over-rule the other, something very like  a dead-lock is theresult.  In January the President  of the  Republic may find it necessaryto dissolve Parliament and seek  a solution in a new general election.The recent decision of  the  Confederation Generale du Travail  to colla-boivite with the Socialists  and  the Ligue des Droits de lTIomme is ineffect mere&apos;y a concentration of the left againsL the right  in the strugglefor supremacy between the  two great parties.
The Resumption of Diplomatic Relations with the Vatican.    In Parliament the question of resumption of diplomatic relations withthe Vatican continues  to  be hotly debated.  As  far  as  the Chamber of deputies is concerned, it will probably end  in a victory for  the  government -ment.   The Senate, on  the other hand, will certainly put  in the wayevery difficulty it can devise.  Its majority is Radical and constitutes anEntente Republicaine with 160 votes out of 318.   This Radical majorityis reflected in  the Senate Committee of Foreign Affairs, whose Radicaldelegates  undertook before election  to refuse to vote in favour of  the resumption of diplomatic relations or of the credits for  Syria demanded by General Gouraud, even should  the Government make these questionsa matter of confidence.Relations with Russia.    The resumption of relations  with  the Vatican, supported  by  theRight, is beit-g used by orators  of the extreme Left as au argument  forthe resumption of relations with Moscow, where, they argue,  the polfticaland economic interests of France are at  least as great as in  Rome.  Thesituation of the Soviet Government is believed by the Soviet authorities themselves to be so  desperate  that Krassin recently sent a message toFrossard urging  the  Socialist  Party to call  a  truce  to internal striferegarding the Third International and to come to au understanding withthe French Trades Unions in order to save  the Russian revolution, whichwas in  danger.  The Confederation  Generale  du Travail consequentlyconsented to collaborate with the Federation Socialiste de  la Seine, theSocialist Party, and the  Ligue  des Droits ie 1&apos;Homme  in  their  actionagainst  the intervention of the Allies in Russia. A campaign of meetingswas organised in  Paris  and throughout France.  Speakers like PaulBoncour,  Leon  Blum,  Marcel  Cachin,   Bidegaray,  and  Rappaportspoke   in the  usual  strain  about the  foreign  policy  of   the  Allies.Royalist partisans  caused  some  disorder,  and  meetings resolved  them-selves into free fights in which success  generally favoured the strongestbattalions.   At one meeting, where Sebastien Faure was speaking, therewas a revolver battle between the followers of Lenin and the followers ofLeon Daudet.   The police managed to restore order after 20 minutes ofintermittent firing, and Sebastien Faure finished  his speech protected  bya triple  cordon of Agents de la  Paix.The Confederation Generale du Travail and Jcuhaux.    Within the C.G.T. an attaek of  some  importance  developed duringthe last fortnight of the month  against the  officers of the Federation, andmore  particularly against Jouhmix.   The extremists, by  successive and repeated manoeuvres, succeeded  in partially gaining their end.  Jouhauxis the most anti-Bolshevik of all the officials m the Labour organisations.General secretary of the C.G.T. for the past 10 years, he has invariablybeen re-elected to his post by a  large majoriiy.  The extremists, realisingthat as  long as he led the C.G.T. the organisation was useless from their point of view, succeeded during the recent National Congress held at the headquarters of the organisation in amending  its statutes so as to makeit impossible for members  of  the Confederal Committee  to hold anyadministrative function on it for  more than a single  year.   The motionwas adopted by a considerable majority, and will make it  necessary toelect auolher secretary at the  next  National Congress.   Jouhaux firstresigned his post of general secretary, and was then induced to remain.Between now and February  it is quite possible  that an amended statutemay enable him to retain his post.
Longuefs Visit to England.   Longuet came to England on behalf of his  group in  order to confer with the English Council of Action.   His object was to ask the Councilto  persuade Krassiu and  RiazanofF to  use  their  influence  with theExecutive Committee of the Third  International  and with the  SovietGovernment in a conciliatory sense and obtain a modification of  Moscow&apos;attitude towards the Governments of  Frauce and England.   The  Council of Action  finally  accepted Longuet&apos;s  point of view.Longuet did not  succeed  in  seeing RiazanofF,  but  frequently  metKrassin.   Krassin admitted to  Longuet that politically he was powerless to do anything   It  was  only  after  strenuous  efforts that  he succeeded  in getting his economic policy recoguised  by Moscow, as he  had beenviolently attacked by Zinoviev,  Bukharin and Radek.  He is  convincedthat he would  inevitably compromise  himself and wreck his whole policyin London if he attempted  to insist  upon the necessity of any modifica-tion whatsoever in the external  policy of the Soviet Government and theExecutive Committee of the Third International.   Krassin advised Louguet to  get the motions that were thought to benecessary voted by Socialist congresses  and conferences.  According  tohim  there  is no other  method of bringing influence  to bear upon theleaders in Moscow and Petrograd.   In Krassin&apos;s opinion the best thing that  could  happen would be ifthe French proletariat could force the French Government to abandon itsfavourable attitude  towards Wrangel.  In  this way the French proletariatwould prove its  energy  and vitality to  the Soviet  Government, uponwhich the  latter would most  certainly make  some  concessions  in the sense indicated by Longuet.   It  is reported that  whatever the decision  of  the coming SocialistCongress which is  to discuss the question  of  adherence to the ThirdInternational,  Jean Longuet, representing  the Centre  Socialists, hasdecided to remain within the party.Unrest in  the  Mines.   The Central Executive  Communist  Committee  of  Stockholm hasreceived strictly eonldential information from  France with  regard to the unrest, brewing among the workmen in the French  mines.    The informants  of the  Committee state  that a connection  is kept upbetween the French workmen and those of  the Sarre basin by means  of confidential agents, also that  there is a  scheme for  proclaiming a strikesimultaneously in France and in the Sarre basin.    Those informants request the Committee to convey the above informa-tion to the Soviet Government  and to  the Executive  Council  of theThird International, and to  obtain  a subscription to the  funds  of the strikers.  The  sti ike, if it takes place, will certainly be long and difficult;money is therefore absolutely necessary.                             BELGIUM.    The discontent  still lingering amongst the working classes is reportedto be due  to  the steady increase in the  cost of  living, and to delay in passing the Bill for an eight-hours  day.  Industrial depression in manystaple industries is having a marked effect  upon labour, but the threatenedincrease of unemployment  renders strikes of importance unlikely for themoment.
   Broadly  speaking, the effect of CounnuniHt influences is  negligible,though the outbreak of the miners&apos; strike at Charleroi, declared contraryto the advice of the National Union of Miners, is attributed to Bolshevik propaganda.  Recent Bolshevik meetings in industrial centres, however,are in no case reported to have been attended  by more than 50 persons.The leader of the Belgian Communists, Van Overstraeten, has, since his return  from  Moscow, been organising meetings  of this  kind,  wherespeakers  urged their hearers lo take no part in the trade union movement,and to form a united syndicate to control production and profits.   Early in November Van Overstraeten  managed to organise a smallinternational  congress at  Liege, but its proceedings degenerated  into aseries of  disputes between different  delegates as  to the language to boused at the conference, a question finally referred to Russia.   The most active members  of  the  Communist  Party  at  Liege  are reported to be the brothers Juste and Marine Wasterlain,  the  former ofwhom  was receiving money for propaganda purposes in Belgium fromRutgers,  the  Dutch Communist.                               ITALY. Extremists.    The past two months have been marked by a general reaction against extreme doctrines, and the power of the Government to deal with revolu- tiouary matters is reported to be on the increase.  Instructions have been given to enforce the precautionary measures against revolution embodied in  the Royal  Decree for  the  disarmament of the people issued ou the 3rd August.    It is now definitely  ascertained  that  the revolutionary  movement which was to have taken place on  14th October, but was suppressed by the authorities,  was  to have  been the combined work of Communists, Anarchists, and Syndicalists.   It was intended to begin with a general strike and demonstrations, which would gradually increase to revolution by bloodshed.  The  general strike was duly declared  by the Federation of  Labour  and  the  Railwaymen&apos;s  Syndicate, but  the movement  lost consistency and ended in a series of violent scenes in which many people were killed or injured.  The serious  explosion at an ammunition  dump near  Milan towards the end of November is thought to  have been an act of  terrorism on the part of the Reds.    In the earlier part of October itAvas reported that the s.s. &quot;Belluno,&quot; a ship  belonging to the fleet of  the Italian  Federation of Seamen, was visiting different  countries and circulating Communist propaganda to foreign  ports.   The Italian Government  could  not  intervene  without provoking the  ail-powerful Federation of  Seamen to  proclaim a sirike. The  Bolshevik sympathies of Giulietti,  the leader of that  body,  are, however, not quite disinterested enough to please the Moscow Committee. His  use  of the Federation for  Bolshevik propaganda was his way of. strengthening the  Garibaldi Co-operative  Steamship  Society, which  is run by the Italian Federation of Seamen and  to whom the representatives of  the  Soviet Government in  Italy consequently  handed  over  three Russian ships belonging to anti-Bolshevik  Russian owners. D&apos;Annunzio in Fiume.    Every effort is being  made  by  the  Italian Government  to  help d&apos;Annuuzio to retire with dignity from Ftlmie and from the position in which  the  Treaty  of R&amp;pallo  has  placed  him.   Negotiations  for a settlement with bim were  reported  to be progressing favourably,&quot;and,
  given behaviour not too  unreasonable on  his  part, the Government may  recognise and tolerate his presence at Fimne a little longer.     Self-advertisement  is  generally thought  to enter  largely  into  d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s dealings  with the  League  of  Oppressed  Peoples  and  Orientals in general.  Use Fiume as he may for a port  of  embarkation  for arms destined for the  East, his  schemes and  projects are calculated  to strike the public eye more than to achieve practical results.     The Adriatic question was settled a month before the signing of the  Treaty of Rapallo by Signor Volpi, the  plenipotentiary of the Italiau  Government, and M. Vesnich, the representative of the Jugo-Slavs.  On  the  Italian side  the general difficulty lay id the sympathy  of the army  and &quot;patriot&quot;  revolutionaries  for  d&apos;Annunzio.   Gradually,  however,  Signor Giolitti succeeded  in securing the support of those likely to be  opposed to  the signing of the treaty, and d&apos;Annunzio in the end found  himself completely  isolated and deprived  of the support of the leading  generals and of Admiral Millo.   His subsequent efforts to occupy portions  of  Dalmatia met  Avith no real  success,  though  the defections  to his  side of isolated units of the blockade fleet shows that he has  sympathisers  in the Services.  The Italiau Government, however, are  reported to have  refused to recognise the Regency of the  Quarnero, and to  have decided  to urge the Senate  to follow the Chamber of  Deputies  in its ratification  of the Treaty of Rapallo.  Oriental Policy.     Advices  tend to confirm  the modifications of Italian policy  in the  Near East referred to in recent reports.     The Italian Government  seems apprehensive  of   the continuance  in Italy of  the Islamic Committee, and has  informed  its leaders  that  it  would  favourably  regard  the  transfer  to Fiume   of  the Central  Committee.     Djavid&apos;Bey&apos;s   recent  visit  to Italy  to obtain recognition for the.  Nationalist  Government in Anatolia  was  not favourably received by  the Italian Foreign Office, who,  for the time  being  at  least,  were not  prepared  to recognise Mustapha Kemal officially.  They showed  them-  selves more sympathetic  to a  Turkish Government of Nationalist or  modified  Nationalist views  which, in  exchange for certain  economic  advantages,  they  seem to have intimated  that they might be inclined  to  support.   Djavid Bey  gained  the impression  that both France and  Italy favoured a revision in the near future of the  Treaty of Sevres.     The Italian Government, at the beginning  of October, broached the  question of  freedom of trade  in  the  Black  Sea with  the  British and  French Governments.   They were given to  understand that restriction of  the transport of arms to Kemal Pasha and the Bolsheviks was a desirable  preliminary  to any  discussion.  The Catholic International.     A movement is afoot in Italy for the formation  of a Catholic Inter-  national, anti-Bolshevik and pacifist in tendency.  Signor Cavazzoni,  a  prominent member of the Italian Popular Party and Member of ParJia-  ment for Milan, is  in  relations  with the Catholic Syndicates in Holland,  Belgium, Germany, and France,  and has arranged with them  that the  first Congress of  the Catholic International shall be held  at the  Hague  next May.  The tacit conseut  of the Papal  authorities seems to have  been given  to the  movement.  There is already evidence that the more  sensitive  international extremists,  such  as,  for iustance, the  Dutch  Intellectual  Socialists, are considerably alarmed at its progress.  In all
countries,  and more  especially  in  Holland and Italy,  Catholic Unionsplay a part in disputes which, in the  campaign against  Bolshevism, may become a formidable one.German Intrigue.   The Germans are reported  to  be doing their utmost  to  prepare asphere of  economic influence for themselves in Italy, and are accordinglydiscouraging  the  development  of  Italian  industries.    Dr.  Stein,  therepresentative  in  Italy  of the  Association of German Industries, is carrying  on active  propaganda  in Italy  to create the  impression that italian industries  have been  over-developed, and  that  the lack of  rawmaterials and coal makes it impossible to revive them.                              SPAIN.   The metal workers&apos; strike  in Barcelona has come to an end, and  the terrorist campaign has ceased with it, at any rate  for the present.   Theterms upon which  the  men  returned to work  constitute a  completevictory for the  Government, who undertook only that  a commission of technical experts, whose decision  was to be final, would consider  themen&apos;s  demands.  A  large  number of Syndicalists were  arrested,  theGovernment at the same  time taking measures to purge the army of revolutionary elements.   The sudden change in the Government attitude is not easily explained.Until quite recently that attitude had been one of conciliation towardsthe strikers.  It  seems  probable, however,  that the Syndicalists werebetrayed, possibly by Segui, who may, as  an agent of  the Government,have brought the strike  to  a temporary  settlement  and sacrificed  his associates.   Government  intervention  in the Rio  Tinto  strike has  been  lesssuccessful, and little progress  towards  a settlement is reported.   Themen refused the invitation of  tho Government to send representatives to madrid, and said that they considered it was for the Government to sendnegotiators to Rio Tinto.                            PORTUGAL.   Another Portuguese Cabinet  resigned on 14th November on accountof  matters  concerning  coal  and  other Government contracts.  On17th November the  railway strike was  settled, all employees except afew on the State Railways returning  to work.              2. SCANDINAVIAN  COUNTRIES.                             NORWAY.   The cost of living, heavy  taxation, the difficulties of the professionalclasses in  obtaining  suitable employment, and the severe terms given bythe banks for loans are  causing considerable discontent with the existingregime among the bourgeois and farmer classes, which, though opposedto Bolshevism  on the Russian  model, are now reported to  be far  lesssound  than they formerly were.  The  bulk of labour in  Norway is undoubtedly averse  to violence, but  is also apathetic.   The indolence ofthe  older  and  saner workmen  and  the  energy  of  the really  fanaticminority have  resulted in the  gradual  transference  of power  to  the extremists of the Norwegian  Labour  Party.
   Things have now come to such a pass that  moderate opinion carrieshardly any weight  in the  counsels of the Norwegian  Labour Party, andthat Norwegian workmen  now stand  before the world as the servants of moscow  and the upholders of doctrines and  methods which the greatmajority  of their kind really dislike and condemn.   *   At a  meeting of  tho Norwegian Labour Party held on  tho 30th and31st October in Christiauia, the moderate sections  of  the  party  were completely defeated, and  a resolution was  passed  by il7 votes  to  3 infavour of unconditional adherence to the Moscow programme.  It was further decided  to  change the name of  the  Party from &quot; NorwegianLabour  Party&quot;  to  &quot; Norwegian  Communist  Party,  Section of  theCommunist  International.&quot;  Although the resolution was in favour ofunconditional adherence to Moscow,  certain  reservations were concededwhich affect (1) local organisation, and (2) the right of  personal opinionof individual members.  The Socialist opinion  is that these  reservationswill not affect the situation as regards the control of the party  by Moscow.The &quot; Constitutional Press,&quot; on the other hand, anxiously  affirms theimportance of the second reservation, and that  the opinion of the leadersis not the voice  of labour.Communist  Activities.   A scheme of work is to be  drawn np by which  the Scandinavian and norwegian Bolshevik Committees will work  in  the closest co-oporation.Two  delegates  from the  Scandinavian Central  Bolshevik  Committeerecently  met Losovsky, the Russian Trades  Union  leader,  at Reval, todiscuss  the  question and  laid before him a  scheme  by which 250,000kroner was to be devoted  to  propaganda and  the  creation of extremistschools  in Sweden.  A general scheme supported by Moscow is beingworked out by the Scandinavian Bolshevik Committees for  propagandaamongst  the farmers.   It is intended  to win over to the Communist cause the small holders who are largely in debt to  different  banks,  and toencourage them to  transfer  their  mortgages to Communist ControlledFinancing Institutes, such as &quot; Folkets&apos;  Bank&quot;  and the New central bank of  the Norwegian Co-operative  Societies, both of which are backedin some way or  other by Russian money.   A campaign for this purpose will be started at the end  of September, and the publication of a Com-munist Farmers&apos; weekly is projected.Miscellaneous.   The  dated States of America are reported to have  secured theco-operation of  the Norwegian Government with  various  American-German  combines, especially for the Russian market.   The Governmentwill receive  a loan iu exchange for facilities for the  transit of goods forArchangel via Norwegian ports  to the U.S.A. and vice versa.  Thoughhis report should be accepted  with  caution, it appears not uninterestingif read in connection with  the recent activities of Mr.  Vanderlip.   &quot;  Morganbladet,&quot; the  principal  organ cf the  Government, is  nownotorious for its articles in  support of Sinn Fein.   This  newspaper reliesfor information  regarding Great Britain on British  newspapers of the left,  which it imitates in printing accounts of the reprisals first  in  largetype,  and barely mentioning  afterwards  the  murders  which provoked .them.   Vessels with cargoes  of fish plying between Vardoe and Archangelare reported to be used for the transport of arms to Soviet Russia.   The  policy  of the Farmers&apos; Federation in Norway is to force theGovernment energetically to  develop  the  agricultural  resources of the
country, to control food prices  in Norway, and to restrict tlio import offoreign food stuffs by duties and regulations as to quantities imported.   The reactionary elements of the Agrarian Party and of the Employers&apos;Federation are working  in conjunction with  the Danish and  SwedishEmployers&apos; Federations for the abolition of the Court of Arbitration in labour disputes and for its substitution by private agreements  between employers and workers.  By this means they hope to force upon Labourlesser wages  and longer  working hours.  Their  policy leaves the Nor-wegian Labour Party cold, as they consider  that  if a system of privateagreements were adopted they would be able  to break or hold to such agreements as they liked.                             SWEDEN.Political and Economic.   Despite  the excellent  financial  situation  in Sweden,  business  isreported  to be  almost at  a standstill.  Banks  are  refusing  credit onaccount of the depreciation in the value of  shares, and a  newspapereconomy campaign is checking the sale of goods.  The uncertain rate ofexchange and impossibility of trade with Russia contribute to the state ofaffairs in which traders have large quantities of goods to  sell  but cannotrealise them.Trade with Soviet  Russia.   The creation of a Bolshevik Exchange  Bureau in connection with  thecommercial  bureau of  the Soviet Government, managed by the engineer,Professor Juon,  is under  consideration  in  Stockholm.  The soviet authorities think that  the  establishment of such a bureau will enablethem to import gold, diamonds, securities, Ac, legally into Sweden fromRussia.   These valuables  could then  be sold on  the European  markets.Intermediaries have proved expensive, and the bureau would be, in effect,the opening of a kind of clearing  house by which  Russian liabilities canbe more cheaply liquidated.   Lomonosoff will discuss the question  in moscow, and rumour assigns  important parts in the proposed  bureau toSpivak and his brother-in-law, Zimmermann.   Juon has received a written  guarantee  from the Nordiska ITandels-bank and  the Sveriges  Riksbank that gold deposited with them will not beconfiscated or used for payments not  authorised  by  the  Soviet Govern-ment.  He has duly informed  Moscow, and it is likely that 15,000,000roubles in gold will be sent  to Stockholm.   Juon has been clearing  theway for future activities in Stockholm by officially requesting the swedish government that Hoffmann, who represents anti-Bolshevik co-operatives,should not be permitted to call himself the  Centrosoyus delegate.  Juonannounces that the Russian State can  only recognise the Soviet Centro-soyus, representation  of  whose rights private  persons must  not usurp.The question has placed the Swedish Government in a very  difficult position,  and  is  occupying  the close  attention  of  the Council  ofMinisters.   The s.s.  &quot; Kalavipoeg,&quot; sailing  from Reval, unloaded 71  cases  ofgold at Stockholm on the 1st October  and 78 more on 14th October.Extremists.   The Left Socialist Party decided by 13 votes  to 2  to  accept Lenin&apos;s21 points for adherence to the. Third International.   A break  in the flow  of subsidies  from  Moscow  is considerablyhampering the activities of the  Swedish Ltft Socialists, who late  inOctober decided to send a mission there for money, partly for propaganda
purposes in the north of Sweden and  also for the supply of ammunition and arms to the Sinn Feiuers.                           DENMARK.THE  CLEARING  HOUSE AND TRADE WITH RUSSIA.   In negotiating the reopening of trade  relations with Denmark  theSoviet Government  has agreed to reconsider  the  question  of  partialreparation for losses incurred by Danish firms in Russia, but will hear ofno concessions in Russia until the  trade agreement with  Englaud  has been signed.   Krassin appears opposed in principle to  such concessions in the caseof small countries, but strongly favours the  project of a clearing house to be established in Copenhagen.  Danish  industrialists  are  pursuingnegotiations with  him on the subject and are  reliably reported to havereceived  a promise  from America that  American business transactions with  Russia  will  be  carried ou through  this medium, a  staiementemphatically denied by the Department of Commerce iu Washington.LABOUR.   At a general meeting of  the Employers&apos;  Association of Denmark thePresident of that body declared that the continuance of Danish industriesdepended  upon employers opposing any further  increase in wages and ona modification  of  the  eight-hour  day.   This  declaration has arousedprotests among the workmen, who state that wages have  not  increased in proportion  to  the cost  of living, and announce  vigorous  action in opposition to  anv revision of  the clauses concerning the application ofthe eight-hour day.   As  a defensive measure workmen  have decided tointroduce  a shop  council into every factory  or workshop  with  more than five  employees.   A large say  in  the  management of  the industry concerned is demanded for these councils.COMMUNISTS  AND SYNDICALISTS.   The Left Socialist Party resolved unanimously early in November toaccept the 21 points of the  Third International, and has  adopted  thename &apos;* The Danish Communist Party.&quot;   An  inquiry of the Scandinavian Central Committee at Stockholmregarding  the attitude  of the  Danish  Syndicalists towards  the  ThirdInternational obliged Marie Nielsen, the representative  of the extremeLeft Wing of the Danish  Syndicalists, to reply  that  to  make thatattitude favourable it  would be necessary  to  hold  a plebiscite of theparty, preceded by intense  propaganda.   Syndicalists, she  said, were more interested in economic  than political projects, and  it would requireboth time and money to alter this state of things.   Kopp, the  Soviet representative in  Berlin, recently  sent one  of hisagents to Copenhagen with  jewels, the  proceeds of whose sale were togo to the Scandinavian Left Socialists.  These jewels  are  believed tohave fetched 50,000 crowns.           3.  CENTRAL EUROPEAN  COUNTRIES.                            HOLLAND.   The Communist  cause is not prospering in Holland.   At the 11thyearly congress of the Dutch  Communist Party held at Rotterdam on the23rd to 2oth October, the majority of the Intellectuals declined to accede to ,the dictatorship of Wynkoop and Ravensteyn, so demonstrating the
  fundamental disunion  which  clogs tlie militancy of  (he  Party.  The  foreign delegates to a  secret International congress at Amsterdam, which  coincided with the Rotterdam congress, were not allowed to attend the  latter.  Wynkoop&apos;8 opening speech was pessimistic  enough  to  provoke  open disfavour on the part of his more hopeful adherents,  lie had no use  for the revolutionary movement  in Germany ; the future of Communism  in  Western Europe rested  ou the activities of  the British Labouring  classes, which, in  the question of revolution  as in all others, were  slow  but  sure, and  whose effective co-operation  Moscow did not consider  as  necessarily bound up with adherence  to  the Third   International.   He  regarded the movement in England as  of  greater importance than the  more sensational display of revolutionary activity in Germany and Italy.     Generally  the Congress  showed  a poor  spirit.   The  leaders  have  promised too much as  regards revolution in  Holland and elsewhere, and  are no longer taken at their word.  Rutgers is deeply  disappointed, and his departure  for  Italy, for which reasons of health were given,  was really a transference of his activities to a happier atmosphere.    One result  of Erkki Veltheim&apos;s trial in London has been the discovery, from  a statement made  at  a meeting of  the Dutch Intellectual Com- munists, that Veltheim had acted  as Leniu&apos;s  courier  in Holland and had several times carried revolutionary literature to Bolsheviks there.                             GERMANY. Possibilities of a Coup d&apos;Ekt from  the  Right or the Left.    Berlin has recently been full of rumours regarding the  more than possibility of a coup d etat either from the  Right or from the Left.  In German Independent  Socialist  circles  there  is a strong  feeling that  a trial of strength between the Monarchists and the Spartacists is impending.  While leaders  of the extreme Left are working hard for a general strike, the reactionaries  have given orders  to the  Schutzwehren,  Wohnungs- wehren, Orgeschwehren, &amp;c, to hold themselves in readiness to  report. On the whole, forces appear evenly balanced ; and  though weight on either s-ide tends to the extreme end  of  the scale, it seems probable  that the equilibrium may be maintained.  The Government is aware of  the situation and has taken precautionaty  measures with regard to it.    Upon the Right elements Herr Hugo Stinnes  appears to  havo laid a steadying hand, and his influence  will  undoubtedly be against any coup d&apos;etat in that quarter. The  Orgesch  Organisation  in Bavaria and its dealings with  the       Bolsheviks.    It is however in Bavaria that the  danger lies.   The policy of  the Monarchists  in Bavaria is to stir up the workers first and  then to start a Putsch from  the Right, ostensibly for  the purpose  of restoring order. The Monarchist party is so strong that danger of an open revolt from the Bavarian Communists is small.   This party has been  obliged, however, secretly to move its headquarters from  Munich to Augsburg to  avoid persecution on  the part of  the Government.   It has  organised thefts of arms with fair  success, but, in spite of all  efforts, would, if it came to open fighting, be at the mercy  of its  foes  both  as  regards arms  andammunition.  On the other side the Orgesch and the Einwohnerwehrare certainly the instruments of the pan-Geim.m Militarists, who have no intention of  disbanding them.   The Einwohnerwehr still maintains thatits sole purpose is to keep  order, but this claim is  hard to reconcile withthe fact that it  is equipped with Minenwerfer, Gewehrgranalen, and field
guns.  Despite Government denials  there seems  to be  little doubt thatthe Bavarian police  are  in  close league with the Militarists, and havebeen  removing persons giving  information about weapon stores  to  theEntente.  The Orgesch organisation in Bavaria has started a press agency for the purpose  of  counteracting the anti-Orgesch propaganda  of  theFrankfurter Zeitung and the Neue Zuorcher Zeitung.  It aims largely at&quot;influencing the Swiss press.  The Bavarian Orgesch is working in close touch with Hungary, and new military formations have  been established in Lower Bavaria on the Czecho-Slovakian frontier.    During Zinovieffs  recent visit to Germany he was  reported to have come to au understanding with  the secret general staff.   Kopp has been obliged publicly to deny to Tchitcherin Ziuovieffs authorship of a letter addressed to  the  Communist Labour Party from  Riga  containing blood-curdling details about the  supposed  joint military action on the part ofRussian and German revolutionaries.  This letter purported to be writtenunder the instructions of the Council of People&apos;s Commissaries and theExecutive Committee of the Third International.    The German  Majority Socialists  have completed their report on theaction of France in Bavaria, but intend before asking the question in theReichstag to await  the results of  the interpellation  of  the FrenchSocialists on the same subject.The German  Independent  Party.    The decision of  the  German  Independent Party at the Congress atHalle to adhere to the Third International was by no means representativeof the feelings of the party as a whole.  Out of a total membership of800,000 only 200,000 members  took part in the voting, and of these only120,000 declared for Moscow.   The abstention  of such  a  large per-centage proves that  the masses do not  take  the Moscow question very seriously.   Many of  the workers who did vote  for Moscow  had only  avague idea as to what the Moscow conditions were, and should they becalled upon at some future date to  put them  into force, it is unlikelythat the appeal would meet with much response.    Zinovieff, who was at Halle, declared that it was unnecessary for the left Wing of the Independent Socialists to  throw in their lot with  theCommunist Party.  The relations between these two groups are anythingbut friendly, the Independent Left Wing being derided by the CommunistParty as turncoats and Opportunists.  The Right Wing of the Indepen-dent Socialists regards ZinoviefFs recommendation  as  a device to keepalive the fight between  the  Right and Left Wings of their party and to hamper the political  position of the Right by declaring them unjustifiedto retain the title of Independent Socialists.    A  Strike  Council organised by the Left Wing of the Independentshas, according to its own  estimate,  sufficient  money to carry on  a  ten days&apos;  general strike.   600,000  marks a day, exclusive of the moriey ofthe Trades  Unions,  has  been allocated to  Berlin  for this purpose.Similar Strike Councils have been organised in Hamburg, Bremen, andother large towns.The Soviet Delegation.   The recall to  Moscow of Kopp,  the  Soviet  delegate in Berlin, isregarded  as certain.  Zinovietf on his return to  Russia from Germanyreported  adversely on  his  colleague&apos;s activities,  and it  is said that heintends to bring about his recall.  For one thing, Victor Kopp has misled    O AS 8550                                                B
Zinovieff, who from  his  reports  expected to  find  German workmenready for a general strike and preparations for revolution well advanced.Zinovieff consequently  blames Kopp  for misinforming him and  alsoblames him for the  inefficacy of  his  attempts to  prevent  Zinovieffsexpulsion from Germany.  Kopp&apos;s influence with the German ForeignOffice, both as regards the bringing  about of official  diplomatic relationsbetween  Germany aud Soviet  Russia, and in propaganda  questions, hasbeen  adversely  affected by  his  activities.  He  has been  unofficiallyaccused by  the Government of fomenting strikes in  Germany, and thereis  definite  evidence  that   he contributed 1-g  million  marks  to thefurnace workers&apos;  strike organised  to  celebrate  the third anniversary of the Russian Revolution.  He  also controls  Russian prisoner-of-warcamps ia Berlin and lets the interned troops spread Bolshevik propagandaamong the population,  while  threatening with punishment or imprison-ment any prisoners who  wish to join the White  Russian forces.  Koppdenied the accusations brought against  him and supported  his statement by pointing to the  large contracts for  the supply of arms placed  inGermany by the Soviet Government, and by arguing  that these contractscould not be carried out  in the event of a general strike.   ZinoviefFs  censure of  Kopp was  also  directed to the small  resultsproduced by his large  expenditure on  propaganda.   Kopp  is reportedrecently to  have realised 3,500,000  marks through the sale of pearls anddiamonds, some of which were sold to German  dealers and  others to aNew York  firm.  It is curious to note that the secretary of Philips Price,the representative of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; in Berlin, acted as intermediaryand interpreter in the  American deal and  received a  commission  for his services,  of  which, however,  Philips Price himself appears to  have taken no share.   Propaganda work in Germany  has   been  transferred  by  ZinoviefFsorders from the direct control of  Victor Kopp to the Russian section  ofthe German Communist  Party, which is presumably identical with the berlin Bureau of the Third International.  Kopp&apos;s  position  is, indeed,too difficult and too  unstable to allow  of  his being connected with a bolshevik propaganda movement.  The proposed transfer of the  Bol-shevik Bureau in Berlin to  Prague is  also attributed to  the decline  ofKopp&apos;s power, as  well  as  to  the  insufficient adaptability  of GermanCommunists.Transmission  of Arms  to Soviet Russia.   Information has  been  received  from a  reliable source  to the effectthat  Victor Kopp  has received an  urgent  request from  the  soviet authorities in Moscow for the purchase of arms in Germany which are  tobe transmitted to Russia immediately.   These arms  are  to be paid forwith money realised  through the sale  of  Soviet gold.   The gold  in payment  is  to  be handed over  at Reval,  and  credit  against  it is to  be opened to the extent of  500,000,000 marks by a banking firm in Berlin.This firm further agrees  to give credit to firms carrying out Kopp&apos;s orders to the extent of one milliard marks.   Steamers arriving in Reval from Germany have  been found carryingmachine-gun barrels hidden in boiler pipes, both ends of which had beenplugged with wooden corks.Oriental  Policy. , Dr. Von Simons,  the German Foreign Minister,  in a  recent  speechstated that his country would not  press  for  admission to  the League  ofNations,  and would, if she were accepted, on no account involve  herself
in any  offensive of  the League  against any  Eastern State.   ColonelEmerson, of the  League of Oppressed Peoples in Berlin, is in close touchwith Pillai, the Indian agitator, Sheik  Abdul  Shawish, the EgyptianNationalist, Arif Bey, a Turk, and an Arab whose  name  is unknown.,He also maintains  touch with  the Irish Party in the United States, from whom he has received a small sum to carry on his anti-British activities.Economic.   Representatives of two well-known American firms are at present inBerlin  negotiating with  German firms for the  formation of a German-American Syndicate.  This Syndicate is  to furnish Germany with articlesof prime necessity, especially fats.  Germany is being given a  credit of350,000,000 marks for six months,  while  the American banks  haveagreed not  to export the marks but  to leave them  in Germany.  these negotiations which are  being  kept very  secret are  being backed by theGerman Minister of Economics.   A contract between Krupps and the Bolsheviks  for the delivery of500 locomotives against  payment in gold is reported.                         SWITZERLAND.Commun sfcs  and Anti-Communisls.   Swiss communism if far from self-supporting.  The Moscow ExecutiveCommittee of the Third International has voted it a grant for the current year of  10.000  Swiss francs,  part  of which will be devoted to thefinancially embarrassed &quot; Bieler Vorwarts.&quot;   A suggestion on  the  part  of  the Federation  Patriotique Suisse thatan International  anti-Bolshevik organisation  should be set  up has notbeen  altogether  favourably  received  abroad,  the French in  particularbeing opposed to it because it would mean co-operation with, and a supplyof information to, the Germans.The  Socialists and  the  Moscow  Programme.   Many  of  the  Swiss  Comrades refused to accept  the 21  points of moscow and fought against  the entry of  the Swiss Socialist Party intothe Third International.   They particularly object  to the  three pointsrequiring affiliated organisations to remove regularly and systematicallyall followers of Reformist and Centrist tendencies, the periodical purgingof the Party,  and the ejection of members  who refuse  the conditions laiddown by the  Communist  International.  The Party is balloting on thequestion, which a meeting called  by the extremists, Humbert-Droz, &amp;c,was  held  in Berne Ou 27th  November to discuss.  Members who  have left the  fold  of the Second  International, but  do not  wish to  enter theThird on  its  present exclusive terms, demand  that the latter should  be modified to facilitate their admission.The  International Socialist  Conference.   The  International Socialist Conference  to  be  held  at Berne  on 5th December will discuss the question  of the  conditional adhesion tothe Third International recently formulated at Stockholm by the leadersof the Swiss Right  Independent Socialists, Ledebour, Crispien, andRosenfeld, in  consultation with Socialist  delegates of other  countries.A successful issue of the Berne Conference would provide a future  basis    O AS 8550                                                 C
for negotiations&apos;011  with the Committee of  tho  Third International, uponwhich the latter wotdd  have to decide whether iutransigeance regarding,or an apparent modification of, Letrir/s 21 points, was the better policy.                             AUSTRIA.General.    Failing financial assistance on the part of Great  Britain  and  America,the economic situation in Austria must be considered as practically hope-less.  It was signalised  recently by a strike on  the part  of large sectionsof  the  Vienna  officials,  the  equivalent of our  second  grade  clerks,employed in the Post Office, Ministry  of  Finance, Customs, PassportDepartment and provincial Courts, together with members  of the  police and the Security  Department,  whose striking  work  on a question of promotion has brought  the  financial  crisis  to  a head.  Failing outsidehelp the grant of anything like adequate rates of pay to  these men, who,at present rates, are starving, IS quite beyond the power of theadiniuistra-tion.  It is the first protest of the middle class, &quot;of the  men who formerlylooked down upon, but now envy, the workman.&quot;    Hitherto Communist propaganda has failed to make much impression,and Lenin&apos;s agent, Bronsky, is reported  to  have profoundly disappointedhis master by failing to  impress principles of Communism upon the minds of the Ausrrians.  The  defeat  of the Communists at the elections IS afurther  proof of the general reaction against Moscow.    The financial problem,  however, makes  the situation exceedingly difficult.   It strengthens the  Anschluss movement,  which  continuesunabated  and which credit  from  Great  Britain  and  America  would,probably!y go far to destroy.The Soviet  Representative.    Bronsky, the Soviet representative  IN Vienna, AVHOSE differences withLenin are referred to above, is reported to be remarkably well informed on events in the Entente countries and to have agents  in a position to SEEconfidential  telegrams in the  Austrian  Ministry  for Foreign  Affairs,Bronsky gets through a lot of money.   Large sums borrowed from localCommunists  and from  Victor   Kopp  in Berlin have  b&quot;&apos;CN  expended,Toman, a delegate of the Austrian Con munist  Party  to the Congress ofthe Third International  in Moscow, has also done well out of his connec-tion.  He is living on a well-furnished  flat, with a  bathroom  and everymodern  convenience,  which he  could certainly  not have afforded before his visit to Moscow.Political.    The  following remarks  made  in  confidence  by Police   PresidentSchober on  his  endeavour  to  form a  Cabinet may be of interest asthrowing  light on conditions in Austria :          &quot; I will  not undertake to form a Cabinet  and  act  as Prime       Minister of Austria until 1 am  assured  that  the intrigues of party       politicians will be relegated to a secondary position.         &quot; I have during two weeks negotiated for three  hours daily with       the representatives of each party.   I find that, with few exceptions,      they place their own  interests first ; those of their own group in       the party second ;  those of their  party third, and the interests of       Austria last of all.         &quot; Until  I see  that the last interest  becomes  first, I will  not      accept  the  task  I  am  invited to  undertake.   I  am not a party
      politician, nor  does Austria require  me to become one.   No party-      Prime Minister could live for a month under present conditions.        &quot; Austria  requires  reconstructing under the direction of  dis-      interested experts.   1 can build  up a Cabinet  of  experts without      party significance.   But their independence must be recognised,      must be  acknowledged by all. parties, maintained by all parties.      And to this  end  I must have guarantees.   I have  not yet received      them.  Perhaps in a week&apos;s time they will be forthcoming ;  I  will      then accept my task.  What Austria can  do will be done.        &quot; But remember  that Austria  cannot be made  to  live without      the help  of Enghind  and  America.   Without coal  and  raw      material we  cannot work.  If  England and America give us  coal      and raw material we can and will work.        &quot; Then in five years Austria  will live.  But  the credit given      must be a long-term credit.  A  long-term credit will enable us to      produce ; by production the  value  of  the  krona will rise.   Not      until the value of  the krona has risen must we be asked to repay      the credits.        &apos;k 1 shall  appoint  a  Finance  Minister who is worthy  of  the      confidence  of  England and America.   Not a  banker, but a  man      of wide  knowledge  and great integrity a  practical  man  and a      scientific man  ; not a party politician, but a  patriot.   He would      not stay in his office in Vienna, but would go to England  and      America and  convince  them  that  Austria  must and shall  live,      and, living,  will honourably repay  those  who have made her life      possible.         &quot; It must not bo fo-gotten that Austria is a new country.   Its      resources have  never been developed ;  its water power  will in      10 years time substitute the necessity for foreign  coal.  Then our      capacity for work  will  be  given full opportunity, and  it must be      remembered  that  the intelligence  and skill  of  our workmen  is      unrivalled.         &quot; Give us  time ;  give  us  confidence ; give us credit, and we      will play a role of no mean importance in the  comity of  European      nations.&quot;                       CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.General.   The spirit of the  working classes  appears to be good, and the leadersof the metal workers have assured the big factory owners that labour isprepared to stand  solidly behind  their employers and the Government intiding over the  industrial crisis.   In  official circles Bolshevism  is  not regarded  as a  serious menace.President Masaryk is confident that  his people are more swayed by  whatthey see than by what  they hear, and  are in no danger of  being  carriedaway by  soap-box orators.  Even  extreme Socialists hesitate to adoptthe programme of the Third International without  very definite modifi-cations.  Most of the party  leaders are political  profiteers,  and  thoseprepared  to  stake their  political fortunes  on the  dictatorship  of theproletariat are few and  far between.   Indeed, although  most of the extremist leaders  declare themselves Internationalists, they cannot  bringthemselves to overlook the racial  differences between Germans, Magyars,and Czechs.  Czecho-Slovak Socialists are acutely aware of the differences of character and  complexion between Czech communism and the  com-communism of Russia.                                                             0 2
   The dissensions within the Socialist party occasioned by the Moscowprogramme have  on the whole weakened  the Communist forces  in  thedisturbed districts of Northern Bohemia, where in any case the Communistfactions are insignificant but for their  connection with the Spartacists inBerlin and Vienna.   Kladno is the one point where Communist influencesreally make themselves felt.   In  sliort, although the coming  winter  presents difficulties from  aneconomic point  of view,  tho situation is  satisfactory.   The  Minister ofPublic Works has asked industrials to  lessen unemployment by employingmore workmen during the coming  winter than they actually require.DR. GILLERSON  AND  THE COMMUNISTS.    Under these circumstances it  is not surprising to find Dr. Gillerson,the Soviet representative in Prague, complaining to  Kopp  in Berlin thathis position in Prague is getting more difficult from day to day. Gillersoucomplains of the hostility towards him of  Russian  reactionaries and  theFrench Legation, who have succeeded in  turning the Czech legionariesagainst him so  that they have submitted a resolution to  the Governmentdemanding the  expulsion  of Soviet,  Government agents  from  Czeoho-Slovakia and the immediate evacuation of  the  Russian  prisoners&apos; camps.Gillersou asks the Soviet  Government  to obtain for him a guarantee of full  territorial  rights.   He remarks upon  the  changed attitude  of  the czecho-Slovak Government, which, whereas it formerly favoured recog-nition of the Soviet Government, is  now  openly hostile to it.   certain persons,  he  says, are trying to force  the  Government  t) assist  Polandagainst  Soviet  Russia  in consideration  for   favours territorial  andfinancial.MONARCHISM.    In  comments on  the  situation in  Czecho-slovakia  Dr. Gillersonremarks  on the strength of the movement, supported by French  agents in Prague, in  favour of a restoration of  the Hnpsburg  monarchy.  It is,indeed, believed  in certain quarters that the Czecho-Slovak Republic isin  greater danger on the Monarchist, than  on the Bolshevist, side.   Dr.Kramer, who is strongly reactionary and has the support of the Agrarians, is believed to be in relations with the remnants of  the  Hapsburgs and to desire a  Catholic  Danubian Confederation.  He is  reported to  believe that  in  this he can gain the support of  the French and to be  bitterly opposed to  the republicanism which causes  President Masaryk to favour a rapprochement with the British Labour  Party and other  upholders of moderate labour principles throughout the world. POLISH-HUNGARIAN INTRIGUES.    Not  unconnected with the Monarchist activities is the co-operation in political and military propaganda of Poland and Hungary, intended to prepare  the way for the  break-up of Czecho-Slovakia and  the reunion of Slovakia with  Hungary.          4. RUSSIA  AND THE BORDER  STATES.                              RUSSIA. TRADE WITH RUSSIA.    There is confirmation  from various quarters of  the methods of the Soviet Trade  Delegation  abroad, described at  length  in Part 1; of our Report for  October.  The Supreme Economic  Soviet Council of  Russia
lias, it is  true, issued a decree  pointing out the  general  principles onwhich foreign capitalists may be permitted to exploit the natural richesof the country.  The decree points out that Soviet  Russia requires offers of experienced forces and large  material means in order  to create withinthe boundaries of Soviet Russia an inexhaustible source of raw materials,for manufacture both on the  spot and abroad.  It also  points out  thatthe present  law permits foreign  capitalists  to work the natural riches ofRussia, receiving in return the right to export abroad a portion&apos;of whatis produced.   The decree further promises  the capitalists  that nothingthey  invest in their undertakings shall be nationalised, confiscated orrequisitioned  and gives them the privilege of  engaging  workers  and employees for their  undertakings in accordance with the existing labourregulations.    As long as the Bolsheviks confine themselves tf&apos; decrees  it is all plainsailing.  It is when he comes to business that the Soviet Russian shows thecloven hoof.   Contracts which have been negotiated over long periods oftime  suddenly fail or gradually peter out.    Tho methods of the soviet trade Delegation at  Reval appear to be similar in this respect to those ofthe Delegation in London, reported in our last issue.  A representative of  abig American firm exporting harvest and haymaking machines has wastedseveral months in an endeavour to bring off a contract.   The Bolsheviksfirst proposed to buy two million machines.  When  prices were  quotedthey  diminished  the number to 200,000.   When it came  to  signingthe contract  they  ordered   20.  A Mr, Michael, who  represents theinterests of a large  American  concern  and  stated that his principalsdesire was to restore the agricultural resources of Russia by providingall that  was  necessary as  nearly as possible at  cost price, practicallysucceeded  in  putting  through a  large  contract with  M. Solomon,Gukovsky&apos;s right hand man in the Reval  Delegation.  This  contract,however,  failed, owing  to  the latter demanding some trifling reductionin price,  which  ci uld  not  be  agreed  to.  The  Delegation began bvoffering  the  usual  terms  of 30 per   cent, deposit in gold  and  theremainder  on  delivery.  Mr. Michael  said  he  had  now  arrived  atthe same opinion as many  others,  namely, that  the  Soviet  Govern-nient  did not wish  to  trade with  America or Britain, but could not understand why they took  all the trouble  to bring contracts practicallyto a conclusion, and  then inserted some impossible condition.   In response to the suggestion that they might intend to gain time and oover transaction-tions  with Germany, Mr. Michael replied that it was either this or  thathigh  bribes  were expected.   He  announced  his intention of  elucidatingthe mystery.   A Mr.  Coombs   recently left  Helsingfors  en route for england after similar treatment  at the  hands of  the Soviet  authorities.Meanwhile  it is reliably  reported  that   Zinovieff and Lit/vinoff are doing their utmost  to  make Krassin&apos;s mission a failure  and have starteda campaign  in  Moscow  for Krassin&apos;s  recall.   M.   Krassin  himselfrecently  announced  that  he  intended to  return to  Moscow shortly  todiscuss  the  whole question  of the trade  agreement, and  if it js acceptedby the Foreign Office to ensure that he shall have  the genuine supportof the Central Executive in carrying out its terms, and, in  fact, all theevidence available tends to  show that  there is no chance  of the  trade agreement in  its  present form or containing  adequate guarantees againstinterference with the institutions of this country receiving the assent ofthe Soviet authorities.Internal Economic  Conditions.    A competent observer  who  receutly  returned  from Soviet  Russiarepresented the industrial failure as due to lack of raw materials, to lack  of
 fuel, to the constant absence from work of employees marauding for food, to neglect on the part of the workmen lo devote either skill or energy to their work, and to the  indifference of everybody concerned as to whether work undertaken was successful or  not.  No  interest  is taken in either the quality or tho quantity of  the work produced.   Skilled artisans Continue to drift back into the villages, where they are absorbed and, as artisans, disappear.  65  per cent, of the  works and  factories of Soviet Russia ate, therefore, entirely  out  of  actiou as  a  result  of  existing conditions.     The marauding parties of workmen  permitted, and  even organised, by the Government as  a reward for good  labour  appear to  have  over- stepped even the generous bounds by them permitted.  Factory workers fetch sacks of provisions from  the country.   But  they do not use  them themselves.  They resell them at fabulously enhanced prices, and so im- poverish the peasants  that they are unable to deliver the proper quantities of corn  to  the   Government.   The system  of  rewards, in fact, has encouraged  speculation to a  serious extent,  and  the Government has issued  a decree that peasants having to do  with speculators will have to yield up to the Government not  only the  quantities due under existing regulations, but,  in addition, quantities equivalent to what they have sold to  the speculators.    Speculators have  been using children  for their trade, as they are not amenable  to  the  laws,  and the connivance of local commissars  is hinted  at  in an  order by the  Government that Fcal authorities  must denounce  their officials  to  higher  authority  should  they  discover that these are accessory to dealings with the peasants.    Krassin has written a  letter  to Kopp in which  he  expresses alarm at a scheme which  is on foot in Berlin for  sending technical  experts to Russia.  He considers that owing to  the present economic state of Russia great care should  be taken in the selection  of  the  individuals, as  several cases have recently occurred in which visits of  foreign specialists ended in a complete fiasco, and even  involved the intervention of  the Extra- ordinary Commission.  Krassin  is probably referring  to  the American engineer, Keely,  who was charged by tho  Soviet Government with the investigation of  the state of industry throughout  Russia. He  made a very pessimistic report to  the Central authorities, and  in consequence he has not been allowed to leave Russia.    Reports from  Turkestan indicate a steady decrease  in  tho number of poods of cotton produced  per acre, and in the total area under  cultivation. Owing  to lack of  transport only a  very  small portion  of the  reduced output has found  its way  to Moscow.Discontent with  the Existing Regime.    The agents of  the Soviet Government  have recently had  their work cut out.  The  formation of groups  or organisations  of malcontents  isreported to be  frequent.  They consist chiefly of individuals  dissatisfied with their treatment at the hands of the senior Bolshevik officials, and ofpersons in revolt against the  despotic methods of their leaders.   Dis-contented idealists who  have  lost faith in leaders whom they formerlytrusted  blindly are also banding  together.   Arrests  are reported to be offrequent occurrence.  A group of chauffeurs  and motor drivers is graduallycoming to  be regarded by the  authorities  and by the workmen as  in aseparate class.   This  group speaks  its  opinions freely and  calls  itselfnon-party,  while expressing anti-Communist views.
   Fear of counter-revolutionary  outbreaks  has  given birth to  a  newseries of orders issued for the defence of  the  town and  province of moscow.  The guards  there have been increased and an elaborate systemof passes, without which no one can  enter or leave the town, has been devised.   After  12 midnight  no one  is  allowed  to go  out  withouta pass.   Peasant  revolts, caused by the requisitioning of the harvest  by theBolshevik authorities are reported  in Smolensk, Oral,  Cheruigoff, Kursk,Saratoff&quot;, Samara, Tula, and the whole  of  the  Ukraine.  These risingsare mercilessly suppressed.   They are neither co-ordinated nor organised.   The Moscow  &quot;Izvestia&quot; gives the following figures purporting toshow the total  number of death sentences  passed by the RevolutionaryTribunal of the Soviet Republic during August and September : Espionage    -     -     -     -     -    -    -        13Treason      -         &apos;.....-  285Disobedience to military orders                        38Rebellion........139Desertion.......-  923Marauding   -     -     -    &apos;.....397Counter-revolution -     -     -     -    -    -    -  124Crime   -    -          -     -     -    -    -    -311Drunken rioting   -     -     -     -    -  ,  -    -23In possession of firearms -     -     -    -         -   35Office crime  -     -     -     -     -    -    -    -106   There are numerous insurgent bands operating in the Kuban and theNorth Caucasus.  The following principles are declared to be the objectsfor which these bands are fighting :    (1) The overthrow  of  Communism  and  Bolshevism, Avhich  have          ruined Russia;   (2) The establishment of a National Constituent Assembly with the          object of regulating the future form of government ;   (3) Land and liberty to  the people and power to the government;   (4) The population to be protected from tyranny and lawlessness ;   (5) Entire  religious tolerance to all peonies ;   (6) Cessation  of hostilities between  the races of Russia, all  inter-          racial and other questions to  be settled by  the Constituent          Assembly ;   (7) Pending the establishment of the Constituent Assembly all popular          government to be defined by local election.Financial Policy.   The Soviet Government, which on the 1st January 1921 proposes to abolish payment in  currency  and to  revert entirely  to payment in  kind,meanwhile bases its  entire financial policy on  an unlimited printing andrelease of paper money.  The commission for the preparation of Govern-ment notes estimates that three milliards of paper roubles are being printeddaily.  The effect ou the purchasing value of the rouble is shown by thefact  that in the autumn of 1918 a pood of rye flour cost 300 roubles,by the autumn of 1919 3,000 roubles, and in September of this year25,000 to 30,000 roubles.   Gold reserves on hand in Russia are reliablyestimated at 300,000,000 roubles, of which 100,000,000 have been placed at the disposal of Krassin for the purchase of goods abroad.
   Even paper seems to have failed as a mode of currency.   A shortageof the commodity is causing anxiety to the Bolshevik Finance Depart-ment, who cannot find suitable material for the issue of notes to make uptho deficit on the budget.   It is significant that  they are buying  up Russian 500 rouble  notes inRiga  and paying for them in false Lettish money.   Notes  paid in  thisway are being sent to Soviet Russia.The Red Army.   Early in November  the army was reported to be totally demoralisedand  men were said  to  be deserting wholesale.   Although the SovietGovernment then claimed to have au army of 3,000,000 men under arms,military expertsexpress the opinion  that out of the 3,000,000 2,000,000are incapable of taking the field owing to lack of equipment.  Aminuni-tion was also  stated to be running  short.  Considerable divergence ofopinion was then  reported concerning  the demobilisation  of the army.It was said that the Djerjinsky party were strongly opposed to anything like a full demobilisation during the next  six months.  Trotsky, on theother hand, recommended a rapid demobilisation of  50 per cent, of theforces on the front, and that, after disarming them, they should  be per-mitted to return to their homes in  the provinces.   The Djerjinsky party would use  the army to force the peasants to  give up the  quantities offoodstuff already demanded which  the  Soviet  Government has so  far been unable to  obtain, but when Smirnoff, the President of  the SiberianRevolutionary Committee, was instructed to  coerce the peasants he flatlyrefused, stating that the Soviet Government had created great disaffectionamong Bolshevik  supporters in his region  by the requisitions  already-made, especially as the transport  department had been unable to remove the supplies from Siberia.   A Soviet of German soldiers and workmen and a Soviet  of Austrianshave just been  formed in  Moscow.   The  German  Austrians in  moscow and Petrograd  number more than 20,000, and there are 10,000 Germans,mostly former  prisoners of war, who live at the expense of the SovietGovernment, and  are employed in different workshops.  They are  to be trained in reality as recruits for the international army.Oriental Intrigues.   Losowsky, the head of  the Trade Union Delegation, interrogated by herr von Simons, in Berlin, regarding Bolshevik intrigues in Asia, repliedthat it was true the Soviet Government was negotiating with the Amir of afghanistan about the transfer of  arms  between Afghanistan and SovietRussia, and that very small detachments of  Russian soldiers had alreadyarrived in Kabul.  He stated that Bokhara and Khiva were in the handsof the Bolsheviks and contended that their policy was fully justified bythe  attitude of Great  Britain, who was doing her utmost  to fosterintrigues against  Soviet  Russia.  Further  evidence received tends toshow that the  Bolsheviks are making a  special  point  of  organisingpropaganda work  in  India.  A large number of  specialists with a com-plete knowledge of the dialects of India havo gone to Moscow and  areundergoing  a  course  of  instruction  before being despatched to the FarEa^t.  Pamphlets are being printed and quantities of  false bank notesare already in circulation in India.  The Bolshevik Academy has among its new students a large number of Persians,  Hindoos, Koreans, BouriatesrChinese, Japanese,.  Mongolians,  and French, besides 82 Germans and60 Austrians.   Hindustani and other Eastern languages  have recentlybeen printed in Moscow for distribution  in the countries concerned.
                                 on                              - -    Chattopadhyaya, the notorious Indian revolutionary, stated that while Bolshevism is a strong card for the Indian Nationalist to play against the British capitalist, the so-called menace in  the  East is  mere bluff on the part of the Soviet Government, since India is not ripe for Bolshevism. Should the  Bed Army  attempt  to penetrate India the  inhabitants would rise against it.   He also points out that  an economically ruined India is of no use to Soviet Russia.  As regards  a religious war, he states that the leaders in India have things so well in hand that a war of this kind is impossible.    Dr. Suritz, the Bolshevik agent in  the East, recently stated  that the paucity of capable  Bolshevik agents was letting the movement  slip into the  hands  of  Mustapha Kemal  and  Euver  Pasha.   The Bolshevik authorities have hence  found it necessary to place an agent in the head- quarters of Enver Pasha, to watch his activities.    Barkatulla has been sent to  Moscow by Mustapha Kemal to receive instructions with regard to the population of Bokhara.   The Moslems in Bokhara are showing a lively distrust of Bolshevism, which they do not understand, and which offends their general convictions.  Krestinski, the Commissar of Finance it) Russia, in  a recent statement to the Executive Committee, declared that he had spent hundreds of millions of roubles on propaganda in Central Asia, Bokhara, Khiva, Turkestan, Caucasia and Persia, and that he could not continue to  bear the burden of these enor- moiis expeuses utdess help was obtained  from the districts concerned. Persia was asked to pay a  fixed sum to  the Third International, which would be used for propaganda in the East.    Theodore Rothstein, who has been  refused entry into the United Kingdom and Sweden,  ha3  left for  the  East, it  is believed for Persia, with a  large staff.                            . FINLAND. The Communists  and  Social Democrats.    The formal split of  the Social  Democratic  Party into two  camps  the Communists on the  one  hand, who, while prefering  to call themselves Left Socialists, demand the adhesion of the Social Democratic  Party to the militancy of Moscow, aniPthe Socialists,  on  the  other has caused considerable unrest in  the  province of Viborg.   A  demand  that the Government should not interfere with  the official establishment of  a Communist Party  was  postponed  until  the  conclusion of peace  with Soviet Russia, as the leaders of that Party believed that the Government would then be in a more conciliatory frame of mind.    Two representatives have been sent  to Petrograd by  the Ministry of Food to negotiate with  regard to  the export of perishable food stuffs to Russia.    The resignation of  M.  Erich,  the Finnish  Premier,  was due to the rejection  by the Riksdag  of  a Government  Bill designed to prevent improper speculation  and the export of money from  Finland  to Soviet Russia after the conclusion of peace.                           Baltic States.                            ESTHONIA.   The economic situation, while still causing anxiety, has been to someextent relieved by the purchase  of foodstuffs  from abroad.  A  proof of the critical financial position is the fact that the Esthonian Government has been obliged  to  sell part  of its gold reserves,  notably  the  gold
received from Russia under the terms of the Peace Treaty, for purchaseof bread, salt, and other products.   The first elections to  the Slate Assembly have just  taken place  onthe conclusion  of  the labours  of  the Esthoniau Constituent Assembly.The extremo right and extreme left have  gained at the expense  of theSocialists,  who lost many votes  to both.   The Independent Socialistshave gained ground, and  the  Trade Union party, which may be regardedas communist, polled heavily, especially in Reval.  A Coalition Govern-ment  of  the Right, supported by the Centre, would secure for Esthonia,which has had three ministries in  six mouths, a more stable Government.Capable  politicians seem to  be a  monopoly  of the Nationalist  party,which forms part  of  the Right.   In the elections the Feople&apos;s parly, ofwhich  the ex-Premier, Mr.  Tonuisson,  is  leader, was  singled out for attack by  the  so-called  Labour party,  to which all  members  of the recently  formed Piip Cabinet belong.   Tonnisson  himself  Avas  accused of conspiring with  the Baltic Barons and  Germanophiles.                              LATVIA.   Protests by the Soviet authorities against anti-Bolshevik activities in Latvia led to the arrest of Colonel Sergieff, the Chief of the TechnicalDepartment of the Lettish Ministry for War,  on a  charge of  treason.Sergieff,  who  is an ex-officer  of  the Russian Army, has for some time been engaged  in  raising  troops for the  Whites.  In touch  with  Paris,Warsaw,  and  the  Crimea, he  had worked  out a detailed scheme for arising in  the North.   The Chief of  the Lettish General Staff, apparentlya party  to his activities, has handed in  his resignation since SergiefFsarrest.                            LITHUANIA.   The Lituanian Government has recently-shown signs of closer relationswith  Soviet Russia.  This  is  probably  due,  not to any real tendency towards Bolshevism, which  would  be inconsistent with the Chauvinisticcharacteristics of  the people,  as  to recent  Polish pressure  and  fear ofbeing crowded out by Poland in  her  endeavours to establish herself onthe Baltic.  It  is reliably reported  tha%-200  German N.C.O.&apos;s haverecently been drafted into different regiments of the Lithuanian Army.                             POLAND.   The general situation in  Poland is disquieting.   Internally the Polesare faced with  an  economic  crisis.  The lack  of cohesion  amongst thevarious political parties is such that there has for some time past.been a growing  feeling  that  a dictatorship, however dangerous in principle, mayafter all be the best solution of  the situation.   Externally the Poles have  endangered their  position with Russia bytheir  secret assistance  of Balahovitch  and  Petlura.   Regarding theultimate  success of Balahovitch&apos;s campaign  they were always sceptical,but they realised  his value  as a  temporary screen  against Bolshevikaggression.  Their attitude  towards him was  therefore one of  slightduplicity  tinged with  apprehension lest his popularity should tend tomovements unfavourable to  themselves  in the White  Russian  districtswhich the Riga peace preliminaries marked down as annexed to Poland.   All their screens in fact  have collapsed.  The failure of Balahovitchand  of Petlura, the  exploits  of  Zeligowski in  Vilna,  as  well  as thedifficulties in  which the Ukrainians  have  become  entangled,  are  allindications of diplomatic failure.
   Much perturbation has, however, been caused in the Central BolshevikCommittee at  Stockholm by  the  report of an anti-Bolshevik  Ententobetween Poland and Finland specially directed to a common fight againstBolshevik  propaganda,  especially  as a similar  arrangement  between poland and roumania was also said to be under consideration.                            UKRAINE,   The  Soviet authorities are finding the situation in  the  Ukraineextremely difficult and have  declared a state  of  siege in all parts over which they have control.   Food is scarce  and riots have broken out inthe provinces.   The  majority  of the male population is under arms.   Vinitchenko, the former premier of the Ukraine,  who together withthe educated classes  of the  country was  opposed to the work  of  theBolsheviks  and  favoured the  Ukrainiau  Nationalists,  has succeeded,through  the influence of  Rakovski,  in leaving  the  country, where hecould in  reality  do nothing without  the authority of a Bolshevik com-missary.   He is now in Vienna, where he intends to found an organisation in favour of Ukr.iiniau Communist independence.      5.  BALKAN AND  EAST  EUROPEAN  STATES.                             GREECE.The Elections.    Even  to those resident  in the  country the result  of the  Greekelections came as  a  complete surprise.  Reports that the  Army would support Venizelos if  he were  defeated at the polls were soon discoveredto be unfounded.  There is,  in fact,  little doubt that  the defeat  ofM. Venizelos was due to the continued  mobilisation of the Army as wellas to the mal-administration of the Interior, due to Ministerial inefficiencyin  his absence, though  the  Royalists assert that the  dictatorial andvindictive  methods of the Venezelists  had long  been antagonizing thecountry.Constantinist  Propaganda.    The  Constantinist press  campaign has  increased  ten-fold.  King Constantine is served by  some of the  ablest and most  unscrupulous pressagents in Europe.  The utter debacle of the Bulgarians after the secondBalkan War was  in a great  measure  due to  the journalistic blockadewhich he imposed on Bulgaria at that time, while suffering  news of  the campaign to reach Europe only through channels controlled  by himself.    There  is evidence now of similar  proceedings.   News  emanating from the Venizelists  is smothared.   Advices indicate  close co-operationbetween the Greek Royalists  and certain sections of the  foreign, notably the Italian, press.  A telegram appeared in the Roman papers describing the departure of the Dowager  Queen  Olga of Greece  for Athens.  Itstated that she was seen off by the British  Consul at Brindisi, who worethe sprig of olive leaves, adopted as a badge by the  Royal  Party.  the telegram from Brindisi was in fact distributed to the Roman papers byRaggniauti, who paid 500 lire to each  newspaper that published it, andthe &quot; official&quot; who bade the  Queen  farewell was not a British  Consul,but a certain  Mr. Cocoto, an ex-British Consul at Brindisi, a Greek bybirth and nationality, who re-assumed office for the purpose.    Information  has  been received to the effect  that the Constantinistsare endeavouring to run  8,000 rifles into Greece  from an Italian port.
   Whatever the outcome of the present  situation  and of  the defeat ofM. Venizelos may be, it is bound  to result in the encouragement of  theConstantinists,  and  it  would be  prudent to reckon  on  a  future  ofunscrupulous intrigue on the part  of  persons who, though they may paylip service to the Entente, will certainly do all in their  power to uuder-mine its ultimate  influence in tho Near East.                          JUGO-SLAVIA.   Since the split in the Communist  Party  the Right Wing is tendingstrongly towards Social Democracy, but even  the Left cannot  be said to favour International Communism and  relations with  the Bolsheviks.                            BULGARIA.   The Agrarian administration of M.  Stamboulisky still holds the field,while facing both ways to resist attack.   The bourgeois parties continue to deplore,  and even in some instancesendeavour acutely, to resist the anti-capitalistic measuies of  the  Govern-ment, which they say  are keeping foreign capital  out  of  the  country.They deplore  legislation whereby agricultural individual  holdings  arerestricted  to 75  acres, and  the  expropriation  of   buildings  for public purposes, against negligible compensation, is of everyday occurrence.   Communists, on  the other  hand,  resent  the rather rough handlingthey receive at  its hands and attack the administration ou the score thatit encourages profiteering among the  peasantry.  The truth is  that they find the semi-communist measures adopted by Slambolisky take the windout of their sails.   The compulsory  labour  law, although not yet  generally  applied, isalready estimated to have saved 200,000,000 leva  for  the country.  Ofthis  amount  2,000,000 was  saved  in  the  construction of a canal.  Thehead  of  the Administrative Department  of the   Compulsory LabourOffice is optimistic  about it, and states that there have been no seriouscomplaints  and  that no real trouble with the Communists is  anticipated.                6. NEAR  EASTERN STATES.                             PERSIA.   The Bolshevik Government  cannot  keep  its fingers  off  the propertyof its  &apos;&apos; Allies,&quot;  prospective or actual.  Two  Persian  envoys visitedMoscow in  October to discuss the payment  of certain debts  to Russia.It was suggested  to them that as Persia possesses  considerable riches inprecious stones, carpets, &amp;c, which could be &quot; requisitioned,&quot;  expropria-tion of the sort would go far to  pay off the  debt.  It  was even hintedthat, such possessions being as dust beside the glories of the Communist&apos;cause,  Persians could  by the same means pay the  expenses of some atleast of the Bolshevik propaganda and military organisations in the East.The Persian delegates retired to lay these promising propositions before their Sovnakom.   Early in October the Bolsheviks&apos; forced withdrawal  from Resht uponEnzeli  discovered&apos; their unpopularity  in   Northern   Persia.   their departure  from  Resht  was preceded  by a  general  requisitioning  oflarge quantities of rice and grain.  Local merchants, however, set fire tothe storehouses, where  the requisitioned commodities lay, and Bolshevik
 retaliation of  the same kind, but  on different buildings, drew upon them au attack by the incensed inhabitants.    The effect of  the  temporary Bolshevik  occupation of  the Resht area was, in fact, a wholesale  revulsion of feeling in favour of the British, who, it was recognised, had  respected the rights and  customs of the population. Tartar troops  fighting  for the Bolsheviks passed over to the Persians.                             TURKEY.    The recent joint  attack on Armenia by the combined  forces of the Nationalists and  Bolsheviks  has led  Mustapha Keinal  to reverse his attitude towards the Turkish Government, and to decline the pourparlers he had formerly almost accepted.    Bolshevik persuasion  took  the form of promises that Kcimil should obtain immediate possession of the Turkish Caucasus, including Batum.    Rifaat Pasha, the ex-Turkish Ambassador at Berlin, who is both  a moderate Unionist and a good judge of the political situation,  is anxious that an arrangement should be arrived at  between Mustapha Kemal and Tewfik Pasha and  his  colleagues.  Such  an arrangement, he  thinks, might result in the pacification of  Anatolia.   Rifaat Pasha considers that there are greater  chances  of this  coming  to pass now than  under the regime of Damad  Ferid Pasha.    A recent Turkophile statement by General Gouraud, Avarmly supported by MODS.  Leygues,  shows that French policy aims at a  modification of the Treaty of  Sevres Avhich, Avhile  conciliating Moslem  susceptibilities, would  at  the same time  reduce the heavy financial burden of French commitments in Asia Minor.                              EGYPT.    Switzerland has almost ceased  to be a centre of Egyptian Nationalist intrigue, though  Zaghloul appears  to have the  support of most of the Egyptian Nationalists formerly resident there, as also of those in Vienna. Many well-known Nationalists in Switzerland have left for Egypt.    The Turco Egyptian Committee, so active in Switzerland during the war, has been abolished, and, indeed, a coolness in the relations of Turks and Egyptians has been noticeable of late.    Before  the office  of the Paris extremist organ, &quot; La Vie Ouvriere,&quot; Avas closed doAvn by the French police ; it was being used as a transmitting station to Egypt, of the Bolshevist newspaper, &quot;Pravda.&quot;              7.  CENTRAL ASIATIC  STATES.                            ARMENIA.   Armenia has  gone -the  Avay of Azerbaijan.  Towards the  middle of November the  Turks presented a new ultimatum, whose clauses regarding the handing over of arms virtually amounted to disarmament on the part of the Armenians.   A Aveek later Armenia had been obliged to agree to the terms offered her.  Prior  to the  establishment of  a  Soviet Republic in Armenia the Bolsheviks proposed  the creation of  a mixed commission with the participation  of Russian representatives to define the boundaries between Armenia  and Turkej&apos;, and in particular, to settle the  exactboundaries of Turkish Armenia.   The opposition encountered on the part of the Dashuaks or ArmenianNationalists the Soviet Government  attributed to action by the  Entente,
whom tliey licensed of supplying (lie population with arms,and of urging the Dashnaks towards a hostile policy against Soviet Russia and SovietAzerbaijan.    The  Soviet  Government believes  (hut  a secret  agreement exists between  Kemal Pasha and the British Government, and that the Britishintend, by supporting the  Mussavats, to eliminate Soviet  authority inTranscaucasia and  to  compensate  the Turks  for the blow  to theirprestige in Constantinople  by giving them Batum.   On the other hand,the Russians  think it possible  that the rumours to this  effect current inArmenia   and Georgia may have  been  circulated to sow dissensionbetween Soviet Russia and  the Kemalists.   The temper of the  Russianstowards the latter is in any case one of covert distrust.                          AZERBAIJAN.   The completeness of the subjection in which the Soviet  Governmentholds the so-called Republic of Azerbaijan receives interesting illustrationby the despatch by the  latter, contrary to all undertakings, of 5,000 mento Resht and  of further forces to Euzeli.   Quite  recent reports tend to show  that  the  conference of  EasternPeople which was held in Baku in August  and September  last was not so successful from the Bolshevik point of view as had been thought.   The Bolsheviks, who, if it had been  a  substantial success from their point of view, would  have  done their utmost to trumpet it abroad, haveconcealed  their  chagrin at  the  paucity of  the  results achieved.   as reported in the article on the subject in Part 2 of the October report, theTurkestan delegates urged the idea of Turkestani Independence eveumore  keenly  against Northern   Communism  than  against  WesternImperialism.   Kiroff, former chief of the Bolshevik  Mission in  Tiflis, remarkedsignificantly on  the willingness of the  Moslem  delegates to attend anycongress where  there was  good fare.   Though  Russian was the officiallanguage of the Congress, only an infinitesimal minority of those presentunderstood it, the bulk of the Conference  remaining wrapt  in  Orientalsatisfaction with the  mere sound of the oratory.                            GEORGIA.   The recent anti-Bolshevik  demonstration outside the Soviet mission in Tiflis was of  great effect in  convincing  the members of  the Missionthat Georgian democracy is from their point  of view strongly reactionary.The Soviet Government issued an ultimatum to Georgia demanding thatall  negotiations  with the  Entente  should  be immediately broken  off.There is  reason to  believe  that  the Georgian  Government refused tocomply with this demand.   A munition factory in Tiflis, run by  American  and Swiss capitalistsin Berlin, is projected.  The Soviet Government is a party to the scheme,and has imposed conditions  which  will guarantee the sale to Russia of allarms therein manufactured.                 8. FAR EASTERN STATES.                             CHINA.   Acting probably on Bolshevik advice, the Chinese  Government hastaken over the Russian legations in China.  Russians in China conse-quently come under  Chinese law.
250                             SIBERIA.   With the  disarming  in  Chinese territory of General KappePs  troops the  last remnant  of militant  White  Russia  disappears from Trans-Baikal ia.  The whole of that vast region is now under the control of theFar Eastern Republic, whose seat of government is now  in Chita.  ThoFar Eastern Republic is purely Communist  in  character, and  maintainsthe closest relations with Moscow.  It may, indeed, ba  said that, withthe exception of the Vhulivostock enclave, the  whole Russian area in theFar East is as much, or  as  little, under Soviet  rule  as are the regions ofRussia proper.  There is evidence, however, that Bolshevik requisitioningbands sent into Siberia to  obtain food  for the Centra&apos; Government havebeen meeting with  considerable resistance at  the hands of the peasantry,who  in some cases  have  organised themselves into groups to defend their property.   Vladivostok alone, with  the support of  the Japanese, stands out inthe midst  of  the  Red flood. The Japanese forbid Communism  in thearea  under their control, but cannot prevent the working population ofVladivostock itself from remaining  Communist  in sympathy.   The Democrats in the  Vladivostock Government remain  in  powersolely with Japanese support.  Japan  is  in great  fear  of Bolshevism.She  has spent  nearly  100,000,000/. on intervention in Siberia.  Hertroops have undergone great trials in maintaining themselves  in a climatemost uncongenial to them.   Japan  realises  the difficulties of coming toany  real understanding with a Bolshevik Government regarding enter-prises undertaken and capital invested, in Siberia.   She has occupied thesouihof Kamchatka to protect her fishing interests, and has sent warships and troops there to maintain her position.   The Japanese  will,  if  they can, merely watch  the  trend  of  eventsduring the winter in order that they may know the best course of actionto follow.   Japan, if  invited to name the date of her  evacuation ofRussian territory, will find  herself very awkwardly placed indeed.  Theposition is, of course, immensely complicated by the Soviet Governmentsalleged  concessions  to  Mr. Vanderlip,  which,  if the Americans  support them, will  have the effect  of placing  the Japanese between  two fires.That this is the intention of Lenin is  manifest.  The  Bolshevik journal&quot; Krasnaya  Gazeta&quot; publishes  a  report of a speech  by  Lenin, whofrankly states that by signing  the  concession which the Soviet Govern-nient has granted  to American citizens  it has  aggravated  the relationsbetween the United States  and Japan.  &quot;In  this, as in other conflictsli  between our enemies,  we are the gainers.  Our concession of privileges&quot;  to foreign capitalists therefore fundamentally means amoral  and material&quot;  victory for us.&quot;                               JAPAN.   The Third International now has established connections Avith Japan,principally with the Young Socialist movement.  Groups  of revolutionaryyouths have been  formed in important  centres under  the leadership  ofintellectuals  and  Socialist  students,  while Japanese  comrades  of  theschool of Moscow  have  started an organ of their own.    Recent utterances in the Moscow &quot; Izvestia&quot; make it clear that  the-Soviet  Government  is acutely uneasy about Japanese aggression  in siberia.   Articles in that  newspaper urge the Far Eastern Republic to
 join with China in resisting such influences to  the utmost.  The famous so-called &quot;contract&quot; between the  Soviet Government and the American Vanderlip  Syndicate is reported, on  good authority, to be  a scheme&apos; engineered by the Bolsheviks in the hope of bringing&apos;about war between America and Japan.                    9.  BRITISH  COLONIES.                             CANADA. General.    During the past year Canada has been very prosperous.  Depression in revolutionary unions  and associations has been caused  by the lack of noticeable discontent and comparatively little labour trouble.   The crops Avere declared by Mr. Reid, the  Minister of  Railways and Canals, to be equal to, if not better than, those of any previous year in the history of the country.  Manufacturing industries have been running  to their fidl capacity, and Canadians boast of having fewer labour troubles than any nation in the Avorhl.    The Dominion Trades Council,  the most important labour body in  the country, Avhich some two  or three years ago  showed  signs of  coming under  extremist influences, at  their  annual meeting  in  September, re-elected Mr.  Tom  Moore,  the  outgoing  President,  whose  success, together Avith the resolution of the Congress to meet in Winnipeg in 1921, is regarded  as a deliberate challenge to industrial unionism, which  the extremists will  probably be unable to take up.    Communist groups, in fact,  are so small in number,  and successive defeats and internal quarrels have so Aveakeued  the One Big  Union, that effective agitation  by  extremists is  not  likely to  prove dangerous, especially as  they are short of funds.   Genuine unrest through Jack of Avork is more to be feared, but unemployment  has  so far  not reached dangerous proportions nor aroused  discontent.  Cases of reduction  in Avages, accepted virtually  without  complaint, are  increasing.   The extremist press  in Western Canada  has been  making a  great show of indignation at one  such acceptance by the  employees of one of largest boot factories, Avhose men  have realised  the  difficulties caused lo  the management  by  the present extraordinary conditions  in  the money market.   Apprehension of  a hard winter is  also  lessening the disposition  to strike.   The  loggers of  British Columbia,  usually turbulent, are now grumbling at the work and pay  they haAre sacrificed  in obeying calls  for strikes. In Vancouver  the  position of  the  Lumber  Workers&apos; Industrial Union  has been greatly Aveakened.  An influx of non-union loggers from the East, and the number of unemployed willing to  Avork in the forests, are making  the officials  anxious.  They know  the mills  have no  orders for lumber, and  that the British Columbia Loggers&apos; Association  is about to make a determined attack upon  them and upon  the Industrial Union, Avho, together Avith the delegates of the  Industrial Workers of the World, caused  much trouble  in logging camps during the  past yea,r.   For a time some camps may be closed down, Avhich, Avhen they reopen, maydeclare &quot; open shop.&quot;  Martens&apos; office in NeAV York,  in a last effort tomaintain its hold upon the organisations that are slipping aAvay, intends to open a  branch in Canada, and, by placing large orders  with importantfirms, to avert unemployment, and so  induce the Government  to treat&apos;Soviet  representatives more leniently.
    Generally it is thought that if a good all-Canadian organisation couldbe started, from which Radical agitators were excluded, it would probablybe favourably received by Canadian labour.Difficulties of  the One Big Union.    Events  increase the discomfiture  of the One  Big Union officials.There is a  growing  willingness  to  take  contract work  in  spite of theOne Big Union.  In  Toronto where the One Big  Union had obtainedcontrol  of  the  Toronto Trades and Labour Council, and  had caused  itto pass revolutionary  and  Sinn Fein resolutions, which alarmed not onlythe steady element in the rank and file, but also the orthodox leaders public sentiment  in the city was offeuded, and a  campaign is now  inprogress to oust the  Radicals from  their positions of influence.  Theexpulsion of the extremists  would mean &quot;their relegation to an  outlaworganisation  outside  the  Unionist  ranks  and the consequent  increasedhostility of the craft unions.    In British  Columbia  also  the  One Big  Union is  very near  dis-integration.  Labour  there is  strongly against  the Third International.In  the  course  of the recent gasworkers&apos; strike many strikers offered  toreturn to the International fold if the leaders of the Internationals could get their jobs back for them.   The  Vancouver Trades and Labour Union,however, has added a clause  to  its constitution decreeing the exclusion of the Reds, and  the returned wanderers were rebuffed.    In a coal-mining town in Vancouver workers seemed anxious to retain their jobs  in  anticipation of  a hard winter, and prevailing  unrest in the cape Breton mining towns is reported to  be chiefly due to bad conditionsof housing and to the lack of water and sanitary arrangements generally.The Self-Determination for Ireland League.    The Dominion Convention  of  the Self-Determination  for  IrelandLeague took place in  October,  after having been forbidden  in  Toronto,and despite  attempts to  induce  the Ottawa  authorities to  forbid  thegathering.   Though the meeting  itself passed off quietly, sufficient anti-British feeling was shown to occasion the founding of counter-organisations.Religious animus was disclaimed by the officials of the League in orderto  induce Protestants to join  it.  This policy  has  its  disadvantages :a number of extremists have also  joined and are embarrassing the Leagueby  resolutions calling for the overthrow of the existing social order.   the demonstration in  memory  of Mr.  McSwiney led to little disturbance, andwas less anti-British than was expected.  Irish and French clergy presenthelped  to  check trouble.  The President of the  Self-Determiuation for ireland  League  for  Canada  advocated straight  Republican principles for Canada as  well as for  Ireland,  and appealed to French Canadians tosupport these views.Foreign Extremists.    The revolutionary agitation is  most  rife among the foreign  work-men, but even among these schism  is  growing,  the anarchists resentingthe opportunism of  the  government, which  the Communists uphoid.On the whole,  young foreigners of revolutionary tendencies are becoming increasingly critical of Bolshevik rule in Russia, and  this  despite  thesupport of  such  organisations as  the Technical  Society in aid of SovietRussia,  which, under strict  Soviet discipline, advocate every phase of moscow policy and defend the practices of  Moscow as  necessary duringthe &quot; period of transition.&quot;     O AS S550                                                  D
    The Jewish  Socialist Party of  Toronto has decided to  form a Com-munist party, yielding full allegiance to the Third International, and theJewish Socialist League of Toronto has decided to create a new party tobe termed the International Socialist Party of Canada.    Extremist newspapers are turning to the revolutionary press of GreatBritain for their  inspiration, rather than as heretofore to the UnitedStates.  The effects of the working arrangement  between the FederatedPress, an  extremist  newsagency   with  headquarters  at  Washington,referred  to in  Part 2 of  our October number, are visible  in  Canadianrevolutionary journals, upon  which the mark of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; ismore manifest.  Canadian Radicals&apos; interest in the doings of the british labour parties of the Left has  apparently been quickened by the visit ofKavanagh  and Gage to Great Britain.                          SOUTH  AFRICA.   The parties  in South Africa  tend more  and more to  be ranged  inopposite ranks ;  on the  one side  the  Constitutionists, standing for themaintenance  of  Imperial connection, and  on  the other, the Hertzogitesand Socialists, who are for separation and revolution.   At the Unionist  Congress at Bloemfoutein the speakers emphasised the imminence of the danger  to the peace of  the country created by theNationalist attack ou the Constitution.  Sir Percy Fitzpatrick&apos;s descrip-tion  of the Nationalists as the &quot; civil war party &quot;  created a profoundimpression.   The unanimity of the Congress was remarkable, and, thoughits unconditional acceptance of General Smuts&apos; invitation caused surprise,it was widely regarded as  according both with  the patriotic attitude ofthe party and with the gravity of the situation.   The authorities view with  considerable apprehension attempts whichare being made to spread  Bolshevik literature and doctrines among thecoloured and native communities.   The natives  are unfitted  by theirtraditions and cast of mind to  be recipients of indiscriminate propaganda which might easily foment an agitation fraught with dangerous possibili-ties  for  themselves  and  the  rest of the community. &apos; Several SocialistEnglish  newspapers of  more or  less revolutionary  character  have alimited circulation and the &apos;&apos; Bolshevik,&quot; the official organ of  the IndustrialSocialist League, is also  being circulated.    The  recently  published  amended Constitution  and  Declaration  of principles of the International Socialist League  proves  that the  aim ofthe body is to establish a Socialist  Commonwealth in  South Africa  byrevolution  and  force with the  co-operation of  all coloured and nativeworkers.    Large concessions  to democracy in its  widest  sense are being made inSouth-West  Africa by the Commission under the chairmanship of Mr. DcWet, Minister  of Justice.  The Commission recommends that on the repeal of martial law the Administrator should be assisted  by a  Councilrepresenting  varied  interests and sections  in  the  population.   ThisCouncil  will, the report recommends, consist of six members appointed bythe Governor-General; five to represent farming, commercial, mining andwage-earning interests, and the sixth to be specially qualified to representthe natives.  Excepting this adviser on natives no person in government services  shall be appointed a  member of the  Conncil.   The Administratorin Council will be empowered to request the attendance at these meetingsof  the  heads of the departments,  who, without voting, will  have fulldeliberative powers,
                           AUSTRALIA.The  Irish Question  and Australian Opinion.   Agitation regarding the  Irish situation, though not very widespread,is providing material for sectarian  and  national fanatics, and  a LabourMember  moved  the  adjournment  of  the  House  of  Representatives todiscuss intervention.  The motion received little support,  Mr. Hughesaffirming that  a  British Member of Parliament who lectured Australiansas to what they should do in a matter of this sort would be told to mindhis own  business.   Mr. Mahon, Labour ex-Minister,  formerly associatedwith Paruell and  imprisoned  in Kilmainham Gaol  in  1881.  has beenexpelled  from the House of Representatives for sedition and disloyalutterances inconsistent with  bis oath of  allegiance.   Protest against his speech have been issued  by various public  bodies,  including the city council,  the Presbyterian Assembly, and the Anglican Synod.The  Colour Question.   The  white Australian policv  of  the  Government  has  received  acheck.  Mr. Millen&apos;s efforts  at Geneva to obtain sanction for its applica-tion  to  the ex-German islands, of  which the mandate has  passed toAustralia,  are  being watched with  anxiety.   A.   certain  number  of japanese already inhabit the Bismark Archipelago and ex-German new guinea,  and a further  substantial immigration from the  Caroline  andother islands occupied by Japan is feared.   The aboriginal  populationof Australia is  declining ;  a  new race of half-castes  of Malay bloodoccupies  the north ; and on the 400 miles of coast line from Cooktownto Cape  York, the white Australia writ does not even pretend to run.Industrial.   The diversion of  the copra trade from  Australia and Great  Britain to america is  causing  both anxiety and  discontent.   Merchants  contend that, during the  war, when arson by German agents and the I.W.W. wasto be feared, irksome restrictions on the trade with  the Pacific Islandswere perhaps necessary ; at present, however, the  cause  having been removed, facilities  for recovering  the lost trade  should be given.  Theauthorities,  who  still regard  the danger from fire as serious, are neverthe-less preparing to build special  wharfage  and storage accommodation in anticipation of a satisfactory solution.   The coal situation in Melbourne is  growing  worse.  The VictorianGovernment persistently refuses to  pay the wage rates awarded by theFederal tribunals to the men engaged in the State-owned Morwell brown-coal mines,  and denies the competency of the Federal  tribunal to prescribe the wage rate for a State-owned industry.   The Executive of  the MinersFederation has decided to institute a coal blockade at Victoria and to ask the miners to give it powers to deal with  the situation in default of  asettlement.   The  two years&apos;  strike  of  the Broken Hill  miners appears to be approaching its end.   The difficulties of interpretation in certain sectionsof the arbitration award have been  overcome and the  miners&apos; organisation has  asked  the  companies   to  enter into  negotiations  with   it for  there-opening of the mines.                         NEW ZEALAND.   Agents  from America are  reported  to be spreading Bolshevik pro-paganda among the miner  and  waterside workers, and attempts  arebeing made to persuade the  railwaymen  to join in  a Triple Alliance.                                                             D 2
    There is a good  deal  of  resentment among workmen at  the rise in prices occasioned by  the excessive  drain  of  exports  to  Europe.  An instance in point  is the  case of butter,   The  British Government pays 2*. 9d. a pound for butter exported  from the  country ; in New Zealand the current price of  butter is Is. 9d.   The effect of  the high  price paid for exported butter will, if it is maintained, raise the  price of local butter to  the same level, and  in  that case  it is anticipated that  Avaterside workers may refuse to load the butter for export to the United Kingdom. Should the  railwaymen   strike to  honour  their  bond  in the Triple Alliance serious trouble  is  probable.  The Government  is  not  in  a position  to deal with  strikes requiring the  use, or  a display, of armed force.    The strike among the employees of  the  Colonial Sugar Refining Company at Auckland is  producing  a serious  shortage of  sugar.  This shortage has become so acute that confectionery works are beginning to close down owing to  lack of material,  thus  adding  to  the mass  of unemployment.  A large  cargo of raw sugar which has been landed at Wellington has been used  as a substitute for the refined product.            10.  UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA. The Bolshevist Campaign.    The Bolshevist campaign in the United States will, it is thought, be  intensified by the defeat  of  General  Wrangel.   On a captured Bolshevist   courier there  has  been   found  a  set  of  instructions from Zinovieff  to  the American Bolshevists.   The document  urges  the establishment of a daily  political newspaper on the  line of the London &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; which Lenin clearly  believes to be of  the greatest value to his  cause.  The   Daily  Herald&quot; is at present  connected with the United States through  the Federated  Press of America, regarding which an  article  appealed in Part II. of  our October number.  Mr.  E.  J. Costello, its managing editor, is reported to have  personally presented an  account of his expulsion  from Great Britain to  Mr.  Colby and  to have demanded au investigation into the circumstances.  The deportation order was  served upon Mr. Costello in this  country  after a consultation with th&apos;e American  Authorities, so   that the  result of Mr.  Cosl;ello&apos;s application is not likely to be satisfactory to himself.   In  the document mentioned, Zinovieff aho urges &quot; American comrades to establish an  underground organisation &quot; forthwith, even, though  it is possible for the party to  work legally.  The  advantages of an under- ground organisation,  he  contends,  are  that  it can carry   on direct revolutionary propaganda&apos;an ong the masses and will, in case  of violent suppression of the legal  party organisation, be in a position  to let  the work suffer no interruption.   There are signs that this underground work is already going on, and  that a secret printing plant  and  machinery of distribution are  in  existence.  Moscow further instructs  the  American Reds to sow dissension in the American Federation of Labour and other Trades Unions and gradually to work the fragments into  a struggle forthe final revolutionary aim  of the   proletariat, the  overthrow of  the bourgeoisie and the abolition of the capitalist order.   Communists  have  succeeded in  obtaining  a . footing  in  the trades unions organisations of the petroleum industry, some of whose workers are even  expressing a desire to go to Russia and work in  the  petroleumbranch there.   Their comrades in the shipping industry counive at  the arrangements with European countries  for  the concealment of  personswhom  Government suppression is driving to Europe, and are  helping
such comrades to reach Russia via Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Flushing, andthe Hook of Holland.  Negotiations  are on  foot for the provision of analternative  route via, Germany  and Belgium, in case  arrangements inother countries should bo brought to nothing.   The efforts of the Third International in  this direction have hitherto been violently resisted by Mr. Samuel Gompers, the head of the AmericanFederation  of  Labour.  The revolutionaries, backed  by Bolshevik money,are,  however, now obtaining sufficient  leverage  in his organisation tomake resistance within the  Federation itself ineffective, and  the  time isthought  to be  near when  Mr. Gompers and the Right Branch  of theFederation  must either fight and openly defeat  Bolshevik  organisers orsee union labour committed to Bolshevism.  Meanwhile, the Government,fully aware of the number of Red propaganda agents who have recentlyentered, or  are about to enter, the United  States, is  expected to imposemore  stringent conditions  on the admission of  aliens shortly after theassembly of Congress.Martens&apos; Bureau.   Martens reported to  the Central  Committee in Stockholm early inNovember  that the American  Authorities were  becoming more  severeagaiu against the Bolshevik delegation, and  that he himself was  on theverge of expulsion.   The Authorities, he says, have sharply raised the question of contra-band traffic in jewels upon information supplied to them by a  Norwegiansailor named  Jesperson, who was found in possession of small cases ofdiamonds sent from Vardo,by Piatigorski.  The  Americans suspect  thatvaluables aud securities are being smuggled in  via. Japau and Mexico.2,000,000 roubles in Bolshevik gold sent to  the States by parcel-post arealso reported to have been confiscated by the American  Authorities.   Acommittee organised by Martens  specialises  in  factory proganda and thomanagement of Communist centres there.  The  method is probably  thatdescribed in  the  article in Part II. of this issue,  entitled  &quot; The  CellSystem of  Communist  Propaganda.&quot;   This  Committee  also  has  itscounter-espionage branch and subsidises the bourgeois press where it can,Martens having  supplied  it with 2o0,000 dollars for   the  purpose.Roustam Bek, Martens&apos; lieutenant, who is  its head, boasts  that  he hasrecruited a  large number of agents among  the  Poles,  Italians, and theFrench  living  in the United States  and Canada,  and particularly iusistsupou the excellent results of the course of studies in military espionage.The secret schools established in New York, San  Francisco, Montreal,and Philadelphia, while not large, are admirably equipped.   Among theforeigners (aud they are mostly foreigners) attending  them five Englishmenaud eight Irishmen are mentioned.Sinn Fein.   The hope that Irish agitation in the United  States would diminishafter the elections has not  been justified.   There  has, however,  been afinal cleavage in the Irish ranks, aud the more extreme partyr, with FrankP. Walsh at its head, has formed an American association for the recog-nition of the Irish Republic in  direct rivalry with the  Friends of  IrishFreedom.  The new association avows  its  determination  to  make  itselftroublesome to the American Authorities, and with  them  it  is probablethat Mr. de Valera will throw in his lot.  The purpose of the association is  to reduce the British Empire to a chaos of revolutions, and out of thegeneral confusion to wiu Irish freedom.
    Sinn Fein  attacks  on  the British flag  have done much to alienateAmerican sympathies.  A group  of American  Roman Catholics haveprotested against the action of the Irish nmb which  attacked the UnionClub in New York because of its refusal to  remove the Union Jack froman Allied trophy.    The partiality of the Committee  of 100 can be judged by its chair-man, Senator Walsh, who  was the author of a resolution advocating theindependence of Ireland which Senator Lodge forced through the Senate.Another prominent  member,  ex-Governor  Falk,  is attorney for theEgyptian  junta seeking independence, and  has  been intemperate in hisdenouncement of England.  His partner, Mr. Frank Walsh, is chairmanof the Committee of Irish Independence.   The  tone of the evidence given  before the Committee  by such persons  as  Mrs.  MacSwiney has gone far to persuade the American  public that no  just or even judgmentcan be expected from it.  &apos;  Both Irish  sections are divided  as  to  the attitude to be  assumedtowards  Egyptian  and  Indian independence and  other  movementsagainst the British  Empire.   The  Walsh  group will  co-operate withany  association whose activities  appear  weakening  to Great Britain.The Information Bureau of the Friends of Irish Freedom,  on the otherhand,  has forbidden  the  use of  its headquarters or publications forEgyptian  or Indian propaganda.  The Friends  of Irish Freedom fear that the connection of the  Jrisli cause with revolutionary movements willunfavourably affect the strong dislike for revolution which marks american public  opinion.   Meanwhile certain sections of the extremists resort tothreats and appear to be in close touch with the murder gang in Ireland.On 18th November a cable was received  in Philadelphia announcing toIrishmen there the projected  execution on the following Sunday of fourofficers who court-martialled  MacSwiney ;  a threat  made  good in thoDublin murders  of 21st November.  A man named J. V.  0&apos;Connor,signing himself as  President of&apos;  the (unknown) Amalgamated  IrishSocieties of  America,  wrote,  shortly after  the  British  Embassy  atWashington ha 1 published the tltreat then  recently received by cable bySir  Hamar  Greenwood : &quot; We warn  you  that  if  after 14th  November&quot; there are any more reprisals in  Ireland, we shall  begin  reprisals on&quot; Englishmen  here.   For every man, woman,  or  child murdered  after&quot; the  above date by  the  cowardly English soldiers and  police three&quot; Englishmen ia America will pay the penalty.&quot;    Officials and members of the Loyal Coalition, a Boston  organisationof  Americans,  opposed  to  interference   in  Irish  affairs, have  beenthreatened  with  violence : &quot; Unless you keep quiet  about a businessthat does not concern you, such as Ireland and all Irish  questions.&quot;  Infor-mation has also been received from  a reliable source that a certain FatherPeter  Yorke of  San Francisco  is  implicated in  a Sinn  Fein plot toassassinate the Prime Minister within two or  three months.German anti-British Intrigue.    The German-Americans continue to seek political co-operation withthe Irish.   Senator Harding received a considerable part of  the German-American  vote, and  these constituents  now regard it as more  thanpossible that two or more German-American members will be includedin the  Cabinet.  The names  of Mr. Charles Nagel,  of St. Louis, and dr. Edmund von Mach have been suggested.                                 DO   A  German  representative has recently visited  the United States  tosettle the financial side  of German intrigues during the war.  His name
is given as von Sigel, and he  is reported to have been in touch withlarankad N. Das, of New York, who  is advocating a strike boycott of english ships and of any concern in which English capital is known tobe invested.   Von  Sigel also approached  the  Hindustan  Ghadr  partyin San Francisco.  He is stated to have  sailed from the United states for Australia en route for China.Strikes and Strike breaking.   The Superior Court has granted an  injunction against local unions ofthe United Shoe Workers of America  and the Allied Shoe Workers  of greater Boston restraining them from continuing a strike which has beeniu progress since  May 1919, for the &quot; Union Shop &quot; at the factory of  theThomas G. Plant Co.   Under  the  drastic terms of the  injuuctiou  theunions are enjoined perpetually from any attempt to bring  about a UnionShop,  from  proceeding with the existing strike or any other strike forthat purpose, from paying strike benefits, from  picketing the plant, fromcircularising either employees or the public, and from intimidation.   A  number of Oklahoma  City  men have pledged themselves  not tosupport the Chamber of Commerce while  it continues its  &quot;open-shop&quot;policy.    Considerable  data has been collected by the Lockwood Committee onthe part played  in building  construction  in New  York  by the UnitedStates  Steel Corporation and  the National Erectors Association withWalter Drew at  its head.  Until last year  the war between the bridge and  Structural  Iron workers  and the  National  Erectors Associationwhich was begun  in  1904  proceeded  along Trade Union lines, i.e., byfrequent strikes.  About a year ago, however, it  was decided to spend acoasiderablesum in preparing evidence for an investigation by the FederalTrades Commission.  It is proposed to show : (1)  That  the NationaLErectors  Association  is dominated  by  the American Bridge  company which iu turn is controlled and  is  a  subsidiary of the U.S. Steel Cor-poration.  (2)  That the Ereetors Association, through Walter Drew, hasset up a system whereby only those  persons willing to do business with non-union concerns may have any steel for building purposes.  This, it isalleged, constitutes a criminal conspiracy.Oriental  Question.    The Oriental question is occupying the public interest at the presenttime.   Although the campaign is primarily directed against the Japanese immigration, the Hindus are also involved iu the general  threat of anti-alien land legislation.   The Hindu is nearly as  unpopular in Californiaas  the Japanese, aud although the former is  a  subject  of the  Britishcrown, he has been, and is now, excluded from practically all the Britishprovinces including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. A movementvwas lately on  foot having for its object the  formation of anon-political society embracing all sections of  Indians  to protect  theinterests of the Hindu colony geuerally in California,  but failed, owing to internal dissension.The Negro Question.    Property  owners in Chicago have  been banding themselves  together to prevent negroes from moving into their territory, and are planning to enlarge their  organisation.   They have decided to  canvass the owners ofall property in  that zone, and  to  ask them to become members of their organisation in order to prevent the sale of property to negroes.
                             MEXICO.   The complexion of  Bolshevism in  Mexico  is reported to be almostcomically consonant with the character of the people.  Labourers affected,believing their position  invulnerable, work only when they choose.  Theystop  their machines to listen to speeches at any time of  the day and theforeman who tries to persuade them to go on with their work is denouncedand his dismissal demanded.  At the Communist Congress held in MexicoCity  in September there was a great display of poster Bolshevism.  TheCongress itself, however, was a failure.  Only the intervention of thepolice prevented its conversion into a shooting affray.   ,The majority ofthe Congress showed scant sympathy for the idea of Communism and theinsignificance of the Communist federation was displayed.   Bolshevik agitators have done their utmost to foment race disturbances.An American Communist, Pat Quinlan, absolutely penniless when he arrivedat Mos.cow, is reported to have  left that centre for Mexico  via germany with ample funds received from  the  Soviet Government and  probablyintended for propaganda among Southern negroes.  Mahendranath Roy,who  represented Mexico at the  last Congress of the Thiid International,intends to return with funds and ultimately  to go on to the United States,where he will engage in  propaganda  among the Southern negroes.  Hewill  probably,  however, continue  his  present activities  in the near Eastfor some time before coming to  America.   Reports have been circulated i-i labour communities that the  &quot;FourthInternational &quot; Labour  Congress,  also called the &quot;Pan-American SocialCongress&quot;  will be heid in Mexico City.   The subjects to be discussedare identical with those  considered at the Third International.              12.  SOUTH AMERICAN STATES.                          ARGENTINE.Communism.   The decision of the  Third  International to extend its propaganda to south  America has so  far received  no  definite  response from  theArgentine Socialist Party, several  of whose local committees have alreadyvoted against  adherence to the Moscow  programme.   Generally  there appears to be a desire  to  wait upon  events.   A  National Congress ofthe Party will he convoked on 8th and 9th January 1921, to decide for or against  adherence  to  the  Moscow   International.    The  mostdisturbing elements in the country remain outside the Socialist organisa-tions.   Much that is called labour unrest  in the outlying provinces and governments is in reality mere normal South American disorder and thework of wandering brigands.   The employees of the Forestal company in Santa Fe, however,  have a more elaborate organisation.   In  themCommunist propaganda appears really to have instilled its principles.The Federation Obrera  Maritima and the Mihanovich River service.   A conference took place  in the earlier  part of October between theMinister of Public Works and Delegate representing the F.O.M. regardingthe proposed assumption  of the river services by the Government.  the directors of the  F.O.M. were reported  to be disposed to agree to theprovisions  of  the  law  and  to   have invited  suggestions  concerning
procedure-   When asked to name their terms for the return of the men totheMihanoich River  Service  they demanded  the dismissal of severaladministrators of the Company and the nomination of  their successors bythe Federation.   This condition the Directors  refused to entertain.  TheGovernment  was obliged to take  refuge  in  endeavours to induce theF.O.M. to come  to  terms with the Company  while for political reasonsmaking it appear that victory had gone to the  men.    The   suggestion  made by  the  British aud  European   SteamshipCompanies that they should combine to force the boycott of  tho F.O.M.came to  nothing as the American Shipping Board did  not  favour thescheme.  A second meeting  was convened by the &quot; Centro,&quot; when itwas decided to ro-opgn the question with the respective Companies, a step which might compel the Government; to come to a definite decision.  Theadvertised intention of the Argentine Government to hire or requisitionsteamers  to replace  the Mihauovich  River Service was probably bluff onthe pirt of the Authorities which, if they had attempted to pay the crewsat the Steamship Company&apos;s rates of pay, would certainly have involved the Government in serious trouble with their workmen in the  Departmentof Public Works,  Customs, &amp;c.    The official organ of the F.O.M. declared  that neither conscripts ofthe Navy, nor blacklegs of the Patriotic League could take the place ofthe strikers and  that without F.O.M. co-operation the River Servicescannot be resumed.The Circulo Irlandez.    Jn their  efforts to boycott British shipping  the F.O.M. have enlistedthe Irish Republicans.   The &quot; Circulo Irlandez,&quot;  under the management of  Monsignor I. Usher and others,  is working to raise capital for theestablishment of  an Irish  Bank  in  the Argentine, in order  to capturefunds and business from the English.  Monsignor  Usher is the principalproprietor of the frequently Sinn Fein  El Puedlo.&quot;    A plot by the Circulo Irlandez to blow up  the Edificio  Britanico, a building  occupied  by  the British Legation,   Consulate, Royal  wheat commission, the Royal Mail and other British companies, on  the death ofMacSwiney was  reported.  &quot; The Liga Nationalista Cataliua,&quot;  in theprovince of Mendova, has announced that it  stands with  the CirculoIrlandez  to the &quot; last drop of blood &quot; for the liberty of Ireland.                          VENEZUELA.    The  Government  have signed a contract with Emil Zimmermanu, aGerman, whereby the contractor undertakes to colonise a region of some100,000 acres in the eastern part of  the Republic with  his countrymen.He is to  settle not less  than  a hundred German  families of the farmerclass upon the land  within two years, each  family having a  lot approxi-uiately of 60 acres of agricultural land with 25 additional acres for eachson  over ten years  of  age,   In  return  the Government  are givingZimmermann the use of 84,000 acres for 50 years.
PART II.              1.  THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN RUSSIA.    The following account of the economic situation is derived  from tworeports by separate Soviet authorities, whose opportunities for knowledge and motives for veracity on the  occasions on which  they rendered their reports combine to make their witness unimpeachable.    According  to one,  the internal  situation  of  Russia is extremelydifficult and is due  to the  policy followed by the Entente.   In  the firstplace the blockade and in the second the state of war between Poland and russia has made  it  impossible for the latter to succeed in anything.   Thewinter threatens all manner of trouble for the  Soviet Government.   Thereis very little  food and if  help does not come from Siberia and the Donregion the situation will become very much worse.   The  only hope for russia is at present in England.  According to the last reports receivedfrom  Krassin  it is  quite  certain that the commercial agreement will be signed.  It is  owing to the help of Germany from the industrial  point ofview  that Russia  has been able to keep her head above water.    The Government has been obliged to make new requisitions of clothingthereby  causing  deep  discontent among the population.   Krassin hasplaced an order in England for material to the value of 10 million poundssterling,  but deliveries are very slow.    There, is  nothing left  in Russia.   It  is difficult to  buy anything, asthe export and import trade has not yet been organized.  The gold reservedwindles day by day and unfortunately the  Government is robbed ou all sides.  It would be  dangerous to  demobilize the army, not only on accountof external, but also because of internal, dangers.    Peace with Poland is  of very little importance ; Polaud is entirelyunder French  iufluence and in future will do  whatever France wishes her to do.    For the moment the task of  the international proletariat is  to keepFrance in check.  Though  they play an important part, very little, asLonguet  himself  has  admitted, can be hoped for from the  Frenchcomrades.    The task  of the German proletariat is to take up an attitude whichwill make France understand that, should things go to extreme lengths,the German workers will  side with  the Russian  workers and join thelatter against France.   This must not be kept from the German workers  ;on the contrary, they must be made familiar  with  the idea.  The SovietGovernment does  not want  war with  France, but it must be prepared forevery  emergency.  The  Soviet  Government looks upon  France as itsworst enemy and  acts upon  the principle that whoever desires peace mustbe prepared for war.    The Soviet Government is,  of course, prepared  to bear the cost ofarming the German proletariat  in the possible event of it coming to the help of Russia.    The only traces of bias  perceptible or likely in  this  report are con-tained in the two  paragraphs which urge that French policy is the chiefexternal danger to Soviet Russia  and that the German proletariat should keep it in check.
   According to the other authority, of whose single-miudedness in thepresent instance there can ha no doubt, the transport crisis  in Russia has reached its  height,  as  the  engines which have  been in  use  up to thepresent are worn  out.   There are no spare parts  and it is impossible to procure any.   Millions of sleepers  are required  for the railways, themajority of those iu use being rotten, but there are none to be had.   Thereare no snow ploughs.   In spite of the extraordinarily se\ere  measureswhich have been taken, there are  sabotage, speculation, and theft every-where.    For  the  year  1920-21  the Supreme  Agricultural  Councilproposed  to  construct  4,600 locomotives and to  repair 5,000, but it isalready known  that these figures have been  reduced to 620  and 1,600respectively.    There are  only  70 factories and  workshops  working in  Russia  atpresent and of these 70 only 21 are working properly because  they havebeen  converted into &quot;storm  factories&quot; (fabriques  d&apos;assaut).  All  thathas  been  procurable in the  way of food, fuel, raw  materials, &amp;c, hasbeen  brought  to these 21 factories, which nominally should employ about58,000 workers.   Through  the war and  by desertions this figure hasbeen reduced  to about 36,000.   Even these  21  factories, 14  of whichfactories are iu the centre of  Russia and 7 in the  Ukraine, cannot obtainall the food the workmen require, therefore the production  is 30 per cent.below normal.  Petrograd no longer counts as au industrial centre becauseof transport difficulties.    None of  the hopes founded upon  help from abroad have been realised up to the present.  Even though a contract has been signed with Germany for  the delivery of 2,000 railway engines,  the contract has not been  fulfilled  as  Germany at  the   last moment  demanded financial guarantees  which  it was difficult  to  give.  The firm  of Krupp* had undertaken to furnish  501) tons of metal  tires (bandages) per month, but has not yet  sent even one.  A  deposit  of  gold in foreign banks was demanded as  guarantee.  It was  impossible  to agree to this as the money would have been confiscated.    The negotiations with the English have  led  to  nothing, as they will not deliver anything until a  year after  the signing of the treaty .f    The deputation led by Krassin has  entered into  negotiations  with the three principal locomotive  trusts in America, but  they state  that their Government  has prohibited trade with Soviet Russia.    The price of an  American locomotive, bought through an intermediary, is 65,000  to  75,000 dollars ; that of  an English locomotive  20,000/. to 24,000/., while a German locomotive costs 2,000,000 to 2,o00,000 marks. It is, therefore, in Germany that  the most advantageous business can be done.  It must &apos;also be  said that the contracts made by Goukovski and Kopp with the Germans were straightforward and easily negotiated.     &quot; It is impossible to  know at present,&quot; concludes this report, &quot;how &quot; our economic  situation will develop in the near  future.  If it is  true &quot; that the  English are  making  preparations against us  in the  East and &quot; the French on the  Black  Sea  and  the Caucasian coast, these attacks &quot; threaten a terrible winter  for us.   We must warn our representatives    abroad not  to promise too much in the way of  exports, as the wood, &apos;* hemp, and flax  which we have to dispose of barely  suffice for  our   own wants.  There is only one ray of light  on the whole situation.    This is that we have been able to secure 100,000,000 poods  of naphtha *&apos; which will enable us to mitigate the horrors of this winter.&quot;   * It is stated on the authority of an agent of Krupps that  the firm has atsocontracted to supply 500 locomotives to be paid for in gold.   f But see opinion of first informant in para. 2.
  2. THE  &quot; CELL &quot; SYSTEM OF COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA,   The &quot;Germ-cell&quot; system  of  Communist  piopaganda, known  in french  as  the &quot; alveole&quot; and  in  Germany  as  die  Kommuniat inciteKeimzelle, has been devised by the authorities of the Third Internationalto meet the condition of  affairs brought about by  the announcement ofLeniu&apos;s 21 points.   The effect of that announcement throughout europe was  a  sharp  cleavage between  the  extreme revolutionaries  on  the onehand and  the reformist  elements in Socialist groups, trade unions, andlabour  parties and  organizations of  all  kinds on  the other.   The germ-cell  system  is designed  to  compensate  the  sacrifice  of  propagandistfacilities, due to this split and to Leniu1s insistence upon pure Communistdoctrine.  It  represents a new phase in  the Communist movement.   A group  of revolutionary enthusiasts, possibly infinitesimal  in  size,is formed  in  the  midst of a  large or   small company of reactionary orreformist elements and proceeds to undermine and disintegrate it.  this work is carried out in offices,  in factories, or in  trade  unions.  It isparticularly active in trade unions, which, as essentially reformist bodies,are the Sclimerzenskinder of the Communists.   Suppose that in  the town of  A there is an official Communist section.In the town  of 15,  a few miles distant, there  may be  only five or sixmen imbued  with  Communist  ideas.   Before the introduction of  the&quot;Cell &quot;system these five or  six,  in order to belong to the CommunistParty and obtain  its recognition,  had  to join the Communist section inA.   This  they would have every inducement not  to do.  The  fact  of coming to an  outside body as  strangers ; the lack of local support; the fear that they might, be unable to meet their own local situations in a waysuited to it would all tend to discourage  adhesion, and  the men, while retaining their Communist beliefs,  would by the mere bias of  circum-stance be withheld from Communist action.  By the introduction of  the&quot; Cell &quot; system, however,  a  group of men,  however  small, can formthemselves into a separate Communist section in no way dependent upona more  important neighbouring section, but having all  the rights and privileges of any section,  however  great.   The &quot;Cell&quot; system  corrects  moral as well  as geographical disad-vantages.   It  takes advantage  of  natural  comrad ship.  SeparateCommunist sections can  be formed  in  different workshops or offices  inthe same  town.  Many  workmen  are quite willing  to  belong to .theCommunist Tarty as long as  they can do  so under a leader of their ownchoice and not under a Communist  Party official in auother town or in another trade or  factory, of which they may in  the past have  beenjealous.  Wherever  five  or six men gather together  a  &quot; Cell&quot; can be formed and  the infection introduced not only into workshops, but intooffices, Government  departments, &amp;c.   When a small Communist  &quot; Cell &quot; is formed all the elected leader hasto do is to get  in  touch with  the  head of the Communist Party of his country.  The  head of the party then causes inquiry to be made, and,if he is satisfied with the genuine  communism of  the section, he reportsits  formation to  Moscow, where  it is  enrolled as belonging  to  theInternational Communist  movement.   The most precise information about the system  hitherto obtained has reached us from Germany.  Here  these foci of revolution are scatteredthroughout the country.   The Communists are in the first place strivingwithin every economic organization in which men or women holding suchopinions can  be found to form a  group  of  comrades to act both as a propaganda bureau and as a  group  capable of action  when the  moment
comes.  Trades unions have been especially attacked by the &quot; Keimzelh&quot;but the system also covers the larger and more general confederations oflabour.  At first the Communists, in their endeavour to keep the word oftheir doctrine pure, were hostile to both  these types of labour organiza-tion, because, connected with  them, they themselves could be at best onlya turbulent and active  minority,  hopelessly outweighed by the moderateelements.   They therefore strove to replace them  by the Political Work-men^ Committees.  When, however, they discovered that this was abovetheir power they fell back upon the policy of a general spreading of  theirdoctrines and,  iu order to instil  their  ideas  into the existing,  in theCommunist sense,  non-party organizations,  they proceeded to apply thedevice of the  &quot; Keimzelle,&quot; first to the Gewerksckaften aud later to thetrades unions themselves.    Geographically, &quot; Keimzelle &quot; are established  where they can  mosteasily spread,  that is  to say, in those parts  of the country which are highly  industrialised.   In Germany  this  means  the  Rheinish-Westf.Gebiet  and Western Saxony.  Their difficulty in  the  Rheinish-Westf.Gebiet is that  the district is honeycombed with foreign-speaking elements.Saxony is  therefore now the  stronghold of  the Communists and has been described as one huge &quot;Keimzelle &quot; working upon the whole of germany.In Saxony itself Chemnitz harbours the most  Communists and the group of the Communist Party there is  reported to be better organized even thanthat in  Berlin,  where the proletariat is reported to be generally less class-conscious and  the Workmen&apos;s Committees to be less well-directed and lessenergetic.   Messrs. Brandler and Heckert., the local Communist leaders,are both plausible  and energetic  and  have  worked to  such effect thatSaxony can now claim to be the most advanced  State  in germany.Heckert is  now transferring his &quot; Cell &quot; system to  Berlin, from whence hehopes that the infection may spread even more widely.        3. &quot;SOCIALISED&quot;  MUSIC  IN  SOVIET RUSSIA.    The following account  of musical development under  the  Smrietregime is  by a  professor of the Geneva Conservatoire de Musique whowent  to hiissia  three  weeks  before the  outbreak  of war,  teas  thereinterned as an Austrian, and proceeded, on the outbreak of the rcvolu-tion, to  Moscow, where he was appointed  chief violin professor at  IkeGovernment Conservatoire.    If you speak to people of the progress  made  in the cultivation ofmusic under the Bolshevik regime, you are  invariably met with surpriseand incredulity.  People ask whether  it is possible that a Governmentwhich  made a wilderness of Russia and a charnel house of Moscowshould have made the cultivation of art, and  especially of music, one ofits  principal  objects.   But the apparent anomaly will not surprise thehistorian.   He  knows&apos; that in times of economic disaster those in powerstrive to forget and to make  their subjects forget, by mental and spiritualopiates, the lack of material comforts.    As  in the  case of other enterprises in Russia, though rather later than most, musical activity has  been socialised.   There was so  muchelse to  be socialised that musicians  began to think they bad been for-gotten,  when,  in  October 1918, the  first decrees reached  the board ofthe Conservatoire, making the highest seat  of musical instruction subjectto  the  musical  section of Lnnacharsky&apos;s  &quot; Commissariat   for PublicEnlightenment.&quot;   It was ordained that the resolutions of  the board ofprofessors, which had hitherto conducted the affairs of the institute as au
4(5autonomous body, wove to be submitted to the commissaries for approval.The students themselves had  thenceforth  their students&apos; council, com-posed of the &quot; elders&quot; elected by each class, to represent the interests of allstudents ou the board of professors.   A  subsequent  decree  deposed thedirector, whose  office, together with  that of the committee, was trans-ferred to the council  of &quot; deans,&quot; or  chiefs of the four  faculties, i.e., oftheory,  song, piano, and orchestral instruments.    The administration having  thus  been remodelled, an artistic refor-matiou ensued.  Experts were consulted,  and in endless  sessions lastingall through the winter and  on into  the summer  months, every nook andcorner of the Conservatoire was examined and discussed.    Starting  from the  common  sense assumption  that  the majority of graduates  from  the instrumental  classes  ultimately  find their  vocationin the orchestra, great  attention was  bestowed  on the  orchestral cliss.It was divided  into four annual grades with  four  trial  performances oftwo hours&apos; duration a  week.  The first  year is devoted  to orchestralexercises for string instruments, the orchestra being conducted by one ofthe violin or &apos;cello teachers.  In the  second year the student enters the&quot;great  assembly,&quot; which  has its  special conductor, and devotes  boththis and the third  year to the study of musical  classics.  In the fourthhe is initiated into the secrets of the orchestral technique of the present day  under the  guidance of another  conductor, a specialist in  modernmusic.  A lecturer explains the works prescribed for  study.    As far as I  know, this  is the  first attempt  ever made  to trainorchestral  virtuosos  by progressive  studies.   At  our  conservatoiresmonths  of rehearsing  are employed in drilling the student  to perform apiece of music that is often far too difficult for him.   At  best, he only hasorchestral lessons loosely and unsystematically conducted.  That playersof wind instruments who have graduated at a conservatoire are helplesswhen confronted with  a score of  Strauss, Debussy, or   Scriabine  is aneveryday experience to which every conductor can testify.    At  Moscow  a string   quartette, composed of  professors  of   the institute, plays masterpieces of chamber music to the students at privateevening performances twice a month.  Besides this, the Conservatoirearranges a series of public concerts by its  professors.    Examinations have  been abolished, performance at evening  concertsat least twice in  the course of  a school year being substituted for them.On these occasions the merits of the student are  considered  by a board ofprofessors.  If the progress  made  is  not satisfactory, removal from the institute can  be advised.    Most important of all instruction is  gratuitous, and uone but talentedapplicants  are  admitted.   In March   1919 all  students  were  examined and the unproficient  compelled to quit the  school.  The Conservatoirethus became  a sort of university of music, accessible only to the select.    But students with  less talent or  training to  whom the doors of themusical university are  closed are not  neglected.  Schools of music arebeing established all  over  the country.  All  towns are provided  withschools  of oue, two, or three grades, according to their importance.  Theinstructional  programmes  of  these institutes are  compiled by  expertswith  the  greatest  care, and meet the  most up-to-date requirements.Here, too,  instruction is free.  Now that  the people  have taken  posses-sion of all  &quot;bourgeois&quot;  property,  the   many popular conservatoiresfounded in all towns at the time of Keiensky, in order to give the lowerclasses  an  occasion to  develop their  talents, have  already  partiy  beencombined with the newly founded  music schools.
   At the Moscow Conservatoire the system of student representationled to no abuses.  I had, however, occasion to notice  grotesque eccen-tricities at a provincial conservatoire.  There  the representatives of the students monopolised proceedings at the sessions, laying down  the law to the professors and criticising their methods of instruction.   In  Moscowthe students behaved with tact and in keeping with  the decorum of the institute.   The reorganization of  the Conservatoire comprised  many good, manyunnecessary,  and  not  a  few ridiculous reforms.  Thus it  was foundnecessary to substitute the expression &quot;workshop &quot; for &quot; class,&quot; &quot; master-worker &quot; for &quot; professor,&quot; &quot; great assembly &quot; for &quot; orchestra,&quot; &amp;c.  great care was taken to remodel and  appoint new teachers for the  classes forsinging, grouped wind instruments, chamber music  and quartettes, thelast named being made  obligatory for all  violinists  and &apos;cellists duringthe whole term of  their  studies.  Provided  with excellent teachers, these important branches are now most artistically conducted.
