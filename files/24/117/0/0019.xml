This Sub-Committee has recommended (inter alia) in                        that                        ,   -          ^s draft report/iniormatior as to consumption, stocks and          supplies oi&quot;  food shall continue to bo  obtained in normal          times so that it may be available for  use on an emergency          arising which would involve food control.               As Secretary  of the Committee of  Imperial Defence I          would observe that  in  our preparations for war before          1914 and at  the  outbreak of war great  difficulty was          experienced  owing to the absence of any -..uch information.                        ;   (bg&apos;d.1 M.P.A.
