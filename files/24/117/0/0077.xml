I i  mm-on i T&quot; &quot;i--i . ul l m j . vi u i mm , un n. j . .mn           In connection with our policy in Mesopotamia, the  Admiralty desire to point  out the extreme importance  of  safeguarding the South Persian Oilfields*     2*    Adequate oil supplies are a vital necessity  for  both the Navy and the Mercantile Marine, and the South Persian  fields provide one of the  largest and cheapest sources from  which the Navy draws Its requirementso     5.    At present 550,000 tons of the South Persian output  is used by the Navy, and this will shortly be Increased to  500,000 torts o  This oil Is supplied at a special rate, and if  the same quantity of oil had to be sought olsewhere the coat  would be six to seven times as great*  Moreover, it is extremely  doubtful if efforts to obtain such an amount would be successful.     4*    The Admiralty must further point out that the  availability of the South Persian supply is a factor In  determining the extent of the oil fuel reserves to be laid down  abroad for Naval use in time of war, their geographical position  being especially advantageous from this point of view.           If interference with supply has to be contemplated it  will be necessary to provide still larger- reserves at Singapore  and elsewhere than Is at present Intended*   5*    The extra cost Involved in purchasing Naval requirements from other sources (if available), and in providing the additionaluar reserves referred to In paragraph 4 must be set off againstthe expense Incurred in maintaining the safety of SouthPersian supplies *   6&apos;o    The&apos; protection of the oilfields is a military matter,since the Naval  guarantee against oversea attack can be givenwith assuranceo         It is understood that protection Is now required againstSoviet Russia  and local tribes, and not against the Turks.         As far  as the tribes are concerned, up to 1914 theAnglo-Persian  Company safeguarded the wells and pipe line by asystem of local  subsidies, and this system is believed to bestill In force.   7o    No account has been taken in this paper of the oilfieldsof Mesopotamia,  In the neighbourhood of Mosul.  The  developmentof these fields  Is still in its infancy; but in view of thedemands that will be made on existing sources of supply by the growing needs  of the Navy and Mercantile Marine, the Admiraltywish to call attention to the possible future potentialities ofthis, area.  They recognise, however., that the question as towhether military occupation is necessary to ensure proper?development Is not one upon which they are In a position to. advise *(Initialled)     W. H.
