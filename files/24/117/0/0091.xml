Papers Nos. 240-B and 244-B.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,             June 28, 1920.
OUR FUTURE  RELATIONS  WITH  BELGIUM.    I UNDERSTAND that the only proposal immediately before the Governmentis that our military authorities should join those of France and Belgium in consider -ing plans for resisting unprovoked aggression  upon the latter  country on  linessimilar to those adopted by France and the United Kingdom prior to the war.   Ithink that this is right, but I desire to invite the Committee of Imperial  Defence to look at the political consequences and to consider whether this is sufficient.  Suchmilitary conversations, it is said, bind us to nothing.  The same was said repeatedlyand  with insistence  in respect  of the  French  conversations, and  no doubt it istheoretically and legally true in both cases, but is it true morally and in fact ? would it have been possible  for us without moral disaster to have held aloof from  the late war after we had proceeded so far, even if Germany&apos;s attack had been directed solelyagainst France ?  And if the future military organisation and defensive- plans ofFrance and Belgium are based upon the results of such conversations and are affected,as in such  a case  they must  be, by the part assigned  in the  conversations to  themilitary and naval forces of Great Britain, and are framed to facilitate our co-opera-tion, could we, without disgrace and dishonour, refuse to act when and if the occasion for action arose ?    I think not, and I do not quarrel with this  result,  for the independence of  theLow Countries has been a secular object of British  policy, and is certainly  not  less essential to us to-day  than at any previous period of our history.  Indeed, moderndevelopments of warfare have increased, and are likely still further to increase itsvital importance.   But if it be once admitted that we cannot afford to see Germanydominating Belgium  and Holland or overwhelming France, is it not far  better thatthis vital object of British policy  should be consecrated  and  defended by a publictreaty ?    The knowledge that such, a  treaty exists may restrain the aggressor, but evenmore important than this, once made and approved (as I think it should be approved)by Parliament, the object and purpose of our policy in Europe  become the object and policy of the nation.  The treaty  becomes for us what the Monroe Doctrine is for theUnited States something  for which, however   imperfectly  understood, the  whole country knows that it must fight, the Ark of the Covenant on  which no sacrilegioushands must be laid, a pledged word which no party in the country will ever break.    By God&apos;s mercy we entered  the late war as  a united people.  I need not dwellon the immense, the decisive advantage that we derived from that initial unity,  butit was not a clear perception of our vital national interest in the stuggle, it  was not even dislike of Germany or sympathy with France or the moral obligations that wehad undertaken towards France,  partly by the military and diplomatic conversations and still more by the naval dispositions, which determined the national attitude.  Itwas the &quot; Scrap of Paper,&quot; the Belgian Treaty that rallied the whole people  at thefirst moment.    It is not safe  to bring a people unawares and unprepared to the brink of war.Least of all is such a course safe with a democracy.  They must know for what andwhen they have to fight.  A treaty obligation is something which all can understandand, once accepted, all will maintain. Such a treaty, protecting as it would a vitalnational interest of which at this  moment our people are more widely aware thanat any time during my life, would do more than anything else to secure national unityif the  emergency  against  which  it is  directed&apos; again arose, and in the meantime  itwould serve as a navigation mark  in the conduct of foreign affairs, and as a guideto the  character of the military and naval force  which it might be necessary  for us at any time to maintain.                                                      (Initialled)       A. C.    June 28, 1920.[3663]
