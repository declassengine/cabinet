16th Deoeubcfc, 192&amp;3m  CABINET.THE NAVY AND kW OADTjflSJi board AND PRIVATE  TRADING.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty,        In the Memorandum circulated by the  Secretary ofState for War on 3rd Doconbor &quot;(C.Po2224),  attention is-called to the assurances riven in Parliament as to theactivities of the Navy and Army Canteen Beard,  and to theobjections raised by a deputation to these activities. the assurances appear to concern the class of  persons who may       ;deal with the Board,  The Admiralty are quits prepared to conform to them.  The objectionsin the main concern the description of commodities sold and the persona who may be      1allowed to buy.  The Admiralty would of course  be bound byany decision reached in regard to these matters^        But I find nothing in this to affect or to meet thecse I have endeavoured to put in previous aemoranda,namely*that the wives and families of Officers and men of the EoyalNavy do not possess the facilities enjoyed by the wives and families of Officers and men of the Army for purchasinggroceries and other canteen stores from the Navy and Army       ;(knteen Board,  It is to remedy this grievance  which is of long standing, that my proposal is made.         It happens that, owing to administrative differencesbetv/oen the two Services, purchases by the Army can be madein shops situated on War Department property; for the reasons give below this is not practicable in the case of the $avy.         In the case of the Army, the purchases are madeat Canteens situated within Barracks or Army Institutes;this is possible owing to the Army being divided up into       ,self-contained units of workable size., such as  regiments*  In   jthe Navy..on the other hand, the wives and families of the men* !wherever the latter are serving, are mostly congregated        jat the three large naval portsj and, apart from&quot;disciplinary   jand administrative difficulties, it is not practicable.owing   sto the very large numbers involved, to provide  facilitiesfor them to purchaso at the Naval Canteens in the shoreestablishments.  The only privilege in this respectenjoyed by the Royal Navy, is that serving Officers andman may purchaso at the canteen and ,takevashore supplies ofgroceries etCo for their wives and families,But this is  avery different matter from wives and families making theirown purchases, and. in practice works out unequally,as the privilege is only operative in point of fact in the case ofOfficers and men actually serving at the naval ports.        The proposal for the Navy is therefore  to open shopsnot on Government property, I cannot find in the memorandum to which I rofer, that the proposal is likely to be moreor less objectionable to the traders than the system alreadypermitted ior the Army,except,indeed,that if rent and rates are-paid in respect of the shops for the Navy (as I presume theywould be) one complaint which the deputation makes aboutexisting Army shops will be eliminated.         On the other hand,the proposal will put the services on an equality,and will remove what is rightly felt by theNavy to be a legitimate grievance&apos;.                          (Ind.)    W.]fel.
