Having scon tho personal telegrams on tho subject of      withdrawal from Persia and liesopotarnia, passing between S* of s,      and yourself, wo now wish to place tho mattor on an official      basis*         Wo had been uranaia: for a lone; time previously the      importance of withdrawing jurors Persia before the winter came on,      in ordor that questions of general policy in. Kesopotamia      might not be fettered by difficulties of withdrawing from      Persia during the winter, but for questions  of high policy      tho Cabinet decided to remain there till tho springs.  They      havehowevers  now decided that tho question of withdrawing tho      force from Persia at an earlier date than April 1st mentioned by      Ironside- must bo fully examined,         Tho evacuation of white refugees from Teheran and also-      where in advance of the troops is, of course, essential, but      it is not necessary that all stores should bo removed,      though anything having the appearance of a panic withdrawal      is to be avoided.         We shall be  glad if you would consult Ironside and                             . opinion      -rive us your considered/   as to whether earlier      withdrawal is a practical possibility and of the consequences      and dangers which would be entailed thereby.      Part 11*  2.  The Cabinet are ansious to reduce aarponl^ture in      Mesopotamia by withdrawal at tho earliest possible moment to a      position covering Basra,  So far as we can ;)udge, the date of      withdrawal from Persia is the limiting faotor, thoragh^it is for      consideration whether time might not bo gained by a preliminary^      withdrawal in the UistiX &quot;Vilayetj before or airnultanoously with                                                             tho
the withdrawal from Persia, to a position-covering railheads^ *-la forwarding an approximate time-table for complete with-drawal to the Basra position, you will no doubt take thisinto consideration.  11? is understood that the Cabinet regard the necessity for the early reduction of expenditure by thewithdrawal of military forces as entirely over-ruling anyconsiderations for the internal security of the country after our troops have left, and taking this, for the moment asyour basis of calculation, the time required for organisinglocal forces in the evacuated area need, not be taken intoconsideration by you.Part III.   3.  Vve have tentatively suggested the holding ofa position including AKWAZ - KUMA - MSIBIYhH with a garrisonestimated at 1 division,  2 cavalry regiments and 2 battalions.You will no doubt give us your, views in due course, stating the general line yon would propose to hold, the troopsrequired, including an estimate of Air Prrces required.,     We are asking the India Office tu send communication on the subject of this telegram to the High Commissioner.
