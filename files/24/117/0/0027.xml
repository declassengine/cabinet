2 327Draft of King&apos;s Speech for the Prorogation of Parliament.Mv LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    My  relations with  foreign Powers  continue to  be of  a  friendly  nature.Throughout  the year My external policy has been conducted in close co-operationwith my Allies.  The general appeasement  of  the passions engendered by thewar has  been  assisted  by a Conference with our late enemies at which  certain matters in dispute were satisfactorily adjusted.   The situation which  has arisenwith Greece, will, however, require  the  earnest  attention of My  Government,who will, in  conjunction  with their   Allies, endeavour to  reach  a  solutioncompatible with our joint  responsibilities.    In Russia the situation is still unsettled and obscure.  I trust that trade will shortly recommence with Russia, and that this may lead to an era of peace greatlyneeded by the  suffering peoples  of Eastern Europe.   It  is of  the   highest importance,  however,  that Poland  and her neighbours  should  compose  their political  differences, and devote their  undivided energies to producing internalstability  and to the task of  economic reconstruction.    The  definite conclusion of peace with the Ottoman Empire is, I trust, near athand.    I have accepted Mandates, under the Covenant of the League of Nations, inrespect of  Mesopotamia, Palestine,  certain parts of Africa  and other  Germanpossessions  in the Pacific  Ocean  south  of the Equator.   The Mandates for german  South-West Africa and the German possessions in  the Pacific  will beseverally administered on My behalf by the Governments of  the Union of SouthAfrica, of the Dominion of New Zealand and of the Commonwealth of Australia.It will be the  high task of all  My Governments to superintend and assist thedevelopment of these countries, according to their varying degrees of advancement,for the benefit of the inhabitants and the general welfare of mankind.    During the past year the League of  Nations has come into effective existence.A long series of important measures has been  initiated by  the  Council of theLeague and the Labour Bureau.  The First Assembly of the  League has shownits sense of the importance  of including all nations in its membership by admittingtwo of  our late enemies.  It is  My earnest hope  that the  spirit of harmony andgood-will between nations manifested at the Assembly is  an augury of the value ofthe League as a force making for conciliation and peace throughout the world.    Since I  last addressed  you I have  had the happiness of  welcoming My son,the Prince of Wales, on his return from his visit to Australia, New Zealand andthe West Indies. The  enthusiastic affection with which he has been everywherereceived has afforded me the liveliest gratification, and I am confident that he has&apos;done much  to  strengthen  the mutual sympathy and  trust  which cement MyEmpire.    The  measures required to bring into operation the  Government of India Acthave been taken, and the new constitution will be in general  effect within a fewdays.  It is  a matter of great regret to me that  the Prince of Wales will not beable to inaugurate the new  Councils. But the Duke of  Connaught is now on his way to fulfil that duty, and I am confident that  the people of India, to whom; heis well known as having filled the high  office of  Commander-in-Chief in Bombay,will accept His  Royal  Highness&apos; visit on  My behalf as  proof of My earnest andunwavering hope that their legislators will so fulfil the  responsibilities entrusted to them  as to bring increased prosperity and contentment to all  My subjects inIndia.MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    I thank you for  the  provision made  for  the  public  service and for theredemption  of debt.  Obligations arising out of the Great War and the disturbedconditions  still prevailing in a large  part  of the world have made  very heavy expenditure unavoidable.  These  difficulties are  common to the whole world,and have been nowhere  so successfully met as  in this  country.  I am conscious of the great sacrifices  entailed by this heavy draft upon the national resources and of the vital need of economy in all Departments of the public service, and my Ministers will continue to make every effort to reduce expenditure.[5192]
the Unemployment Insurance Act makes an important extension of the provisionagainst unemployment  and  enlarges  the number  of  insurable workers from to 12 millions.    A measure has also  been  passed whereby Local Authorities will be assisted in the maintenance  and improvement  of roads and  bridges, thus facilitating thefurther  development of  the new methods of transport which are becoming every year of greater importance to the life of the community.    In the domestic  sphere the past session has  seen a steady return to normalconditions.  I am glad to believe  that  the weariness and exhaustion which besetMy people after their sufferings and efforts during  the war are  rapidly passingaway, and that the difficulties xiri^ikg^kx:i^Kx&amp;^            especially in  /thusindustrial affairs,  are giving place to a  better general  understanding  of theproblems of industry and to  better relations between  employers and employed.The darkest cloud on  the horizon, the growing amount of  unemployment  amongMy people, now  springs, not so  much  from internal  causes, but  from thecontraction of the  export trade due  to the poverty of other nations  and to their inability to secure credits  for  the  purpose of placing orders  in this  country.AH nations  equally with ourselves  are  effected  by  these  conditions.  Theproblem  of restoring trade  and of providing  for  those left without employ-nlent  has  for  some  time  been  engaging the close and  earnest  attention ofMy Ministers, and various  schemes, of which some are already in operation,have been prepared to alleviate the distress arising therefrom.  It  will be theduty of My Ministers to continue to give  unremitting attention to  this problem with  a  view to mitigating,  as  far as is  humanly possible,  the hardships ofunemployment.  .  .As a direct consequence of the  industrial depression, My hope that men whoserved in My forces  during the  war,  and particularly  those who are  disabled,would by this  time  be  absorbed  in civil employment, has  been disappointed.No efforts  have been spared  by My Government to secure the resettlement tothese  men  in civil life, but it has become more than ever necessary that these efforts should be supplemented by the active aid and co-operation of My people.    December 20, 1920.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE or COMMONS,    The  state of  affairs  in  Ireland  grieves  me  profoundly.  I deplore the campaign  of violence and  outrage  by which  a small section of  My  subjectsseek to  sever Ireland  from  the  Empire,  and I  sympathise with the  loyalservants of the Crown who are endeavouring to restore peace and maintain  order under conditions  of unexampled  difficulty and danger,   It is  My most earnesthope that  all  sections  of  the people in Ireland  will insist upon  a returnto  constitutional   methods,  which  alone can put  an  end  to  the  terribleevents which now threaten ruin to that country, and make possible reconciliation.and a lasting peace.   I have given my assent to a Bill for the better governmentof Ireland.  This Act, by setting up two Parliaments and a Council of Irelandgives self-government in Irish  affairs to the whole  of  Ireland,  and provides themeans  whereby the people  of  Ireland  can  of  their own  accord achieve unity.I sincerely hope that this  Act, the fruit of more than  thirty years of ceaselesscontroversy, will finally bring about  unity and friendship between all the peoples of My  Kingdom.    My Government  are giving careful  and anxious consideration to the  questionof naval strength as affected by the latest developments of naval warfare.    During the past session I have been  glad to give My assent to a number of measures for the promotion of the well-being of My people.  Among other Acts, Imay mention  the  Act providing  old age pensions for  blind persons at the ageof 50;  the National Health Insurance Act, which increased the general rates  of benefits to contributors; the Juvenile Courts Act, which secures an advance bothin the treatment of children and in the co-operation of women  in public affairs;the. Mining Industry Act, which  recognises the importance  of mining in theindustrial life of the country by the constitution  of a Mines Department in whichall the powers and  duties relating to the industry are now concentrated;  the Actregulating  the  importation of dye-stuffs in order  securely  to  establish thedye-stuffs industry in this country; and the Agriculture Bill which

 MY LORDS AND MEMBERS O:F THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,     The state of  affairs  in  Ireland  grieves  me profoundly.  I  deplore  the campaign  of  violence and  outrage  by which a  small  section of  My subjects seek to sever Ireland  from  the Empire,  and  I sympathise  with the loyal servants of the Crown who are endeavouring to restore  peace  and maintain order under conditions  of unexampled  difficulty and danger.   It  is My  most earnest hope that  all  sections of the people in Ireland will  insist upon  a  return to  constitutional   methods,  which  alone can   put  an  end  to  tile  terrible events which now threaten ruin to that country, and make possible reconciliation and a lasting peace.  I have given my  assent to a Bill for the better government of Ireland.   This Act, by setting  up  two Parliaments and a Council of Ireland gives self-government in Irish  affairs to  the whole of  Ireland, and provides  the means  whereby the people of  Ireland can of  their own  accord achieve unity. I sincerely  hope that this Act, the fruit of more  than thirty years of ceaseless controversy, will finally bring about unity and friendship between all the peoples of My Kingdom.     My Government are giving careful and anxious consideration to the question of naval strength as affected by the latest developments of naval warfare.     During the past session I have been glad to give  My assent to  a number of measures for the promotion of the well-being of the people. Among other Acts, I may mention  the Act providing old age pensions  for  blind  persons  at the  age of 50; the National  Health  Insurance Act, which  increased the general rates of benefits to contributors; the Juvenile  Courts Act, which  secures an advance both in the treatment of children and in the co-operation of women in public affairs; the Mining  Industry Act, which  recognises  the  importance of mining in  the industrial life of the  country by the constitution of  a Mines Department in which all the powers and duties relating to the industry are now concentrated; the Act regulating  the importation of  dye-stuffs in  order securely to establish  the dye-stuffs industry in this country; and the Agriculture Act which will increase the production of food: promote good husbandry : and improve the legal position of agricultural tenants;  and  the Unemployment  Insurance Act which makes an important  extension  of the provision  against  unemployment and  enlarges the number  of insurable workers  from 4 to 12 millions.     A measure has  also been passed whereby  Local Authorities will be assisted in the maintenance and improvement of  roads and bridges, thus facilitating the further development  of the new methods of transport which  are becoming every year of greater importance to the life of the community.     In the domestic  sphere the past  session has seen a steady return to normal conditions.   I  am glad to  believe that the weariness and exhaustion which beset the  people after their sufferings and  efforts during the  war  are passing away, and that the difficulties thus  caused, especially in industrial affairs,  are giving place to  a better general understanding of  the problems  of industry and to better relations between  employers  and employed.  The darkest cloud on the horizon  &apos; the growing  amount of unemployment now springs, not so  much from internal causes, but from the contraction of the export trade due  to the poverty of other nations and to their  inability to  secure credits for the purpose of placing orders in this country.  All nations equally with ourselves are affected by these conditions. The problem of restoring trade and of providing for those left without employ- ment has  for some  time been engaging the  close and earnest attention of Ministers,  and various  schemes, of  which  some are  already in  operation, have been prepared  to alleviate the distress arising therefrom.  It  will be  the duty of  My Ministers to continue  to give unremitting attention to this problem with  a  view  to mitigating,  as far as is humanly possible, the  hardships of unemployment.    As a direct consequence of the industrial depression, My hope that men who served in My forces  during the war,  and particularly those  who  are disabled, would by this time  be  absorbed  in  civil employment, has  been disappointed. No efforts  have been  spared by the Government to secure the resettlement  to these men  in civil life, but it has  become more than  ever necessary that these efforts should be supplemented by the active aid and co-operation of My people.    In bidding you farewell, I  pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
