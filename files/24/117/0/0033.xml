Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.Telegram -from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India    Bengal. Beginning of dissension among supporters of Khilafat propaganda ana!non-co-operat(ors).   Enthusiasm  of  Marwaris,  formerly among Gandhi&apos;s  strongestsupporters, has  cooled.   Friction  among supporters of Khilafat Committee,  andcomplaints of maladministration of Khilafat funds,  influential Maulana, Abu Bakar,issued proclamation supporting non-co-operation, but Hindu extremists faint hearted,and, while desirous to reverse policy at Nagpur, unlikely to be successful, though wehear that C. 11. Das and  B. C. Pal, who have been in consultation with Lajpat Rai audMalaviya, will put up fight for more practical  programme of non-co-operation thanthat of Mr. Gandhi.  It  will  probably avoid schools and law  courts, and concentratemore  on  Swadeshi goods.    Secession of Bengali nationalists  possible if  Congressconfirms Gandhi&apos;s programme. Rupee  receipts issued  by Khilafat Committee  met with less success than anticipated, but developments require careful watching.  Noteshave obtained certain amount of circulation, probably forced, at Delhi and elsewhere.Agitators been active organising meetings especially to reduce number of iVIohamedancandidates and to  secure small polls.  Position in regard to  schools and collegessatisfactory, but  Bengal students  excitable.  Leaflet published  in  Dacca that anyonetrying to become  Member of Council, or voting, would thereby sever connection withIslam.  Secretary, Dacca Khilafat Committee, being prosecuted under section 171 (F)Indian Penal Code.  We have not yet received official reports, but  according to Pressaccounts polling   was  fairly brisk  in  Calcutta,  particularly  in  non-Mohamedanconstituencies.  Labour unrest continues.    Madras. Interest concentrated chiefly on elections. Advocates of non-co-operation and candidates both made great efforts.   An illiterate coolie returned unopposed toMohamedan seat  in Legislative Council for  South Kauara in  Madras. Some stonethrowing  but no serious  trouble,  and no reports  of  disturbances  elsewhere  inPresidency.  According to Press reports polling  in Madras urban constituencies wasdistinctly good,  varying from about 40 to  70  per cent.;  in rural  constituenciesthe percentage was naturally  lower, about 15 to 40;  polling in some areas beinghampered by floods.  Lock-out, Buckingham Mills, continues.  Judgment delivered in High Court on application for  interim  injunction by Company against Wadia and.others on grounds that defendants had been conspiring to injure plaintiffs by inducingworkmen to break contracts.  Temporary injunction already granted, and in judgmentinjunction continued pending hearing of suit.    Bombay. Unofficial  reports calculate  about  10  to 15  per cent,  of  electorsvoted.  General  lack of organisation and zeal on part of  candidates.  One  DistrictMagistrate reports cyclists sent round by non-co-operators to tell voters elections werestopped, and  rumour widely spread that  object of elections (was) to quadruple land revenue assessment.  Some success in campaign against few schools.  Attempt madeto reduce  to  fiasco Anjuman-i-Islam  School prize distribution, at which Governorattended.  Volunteers posted to turn back scholars and visitors.  Placards denouncingfunction distributed and posted  up around institution.   Nevertheless function was successful.   At  subsequent  counter-meeting,  Patel  presiding,   resolution   passedcondemning  action of  office-bearers  of school  for inviting  Governor  to  prizedistribution, and urging their social  boycott.   Central Khilafat Committee believed to have prevailed upon  gravediggers in big Mohamedan cemeteries to refuse  to burytitle-holder  of  co-operator.  Bands of mill-hands  led  through  streets persuadingvendors of: teashops to close,  and  in consequence of Mohamedan revivalist movementmob of  several hundreds visited,  liquor shops  and  molested Mussulman  customers.Bomanji described Gandhi as the &quot; Zaghlul Pasha  of India.&quot;  Considerable labourunrest.   Baptista  announced  intention of starting messenger service, Bombay, from 1st December,  ex-postal men to  be  employed.   Doubtful whether  local  messengerservice will pay its way.    Bihar and Orissa. Vigorous agitation  directed  against  Roman Catholic schools.For moment  some success secured ; number of boys influenced, but action  has caused      2949    100  12.20
distinct hardening in the minds of responsible persons  against this agitation.  iWehave not  yet  had report of results of GandhPs tour;  but he and  his followers  havebeen making  speeches  in  usual  style.   Effect likely to be ephemeral.   Gandhi hadinterview with Hasan Lman and  made misleading references to subject in speech atPatna, stating that Hasan Iman favoured non-co-operation, and would join movementas  soon as bar  removed,  on  violence.   Hasan  I man  has written . to  Searchlightdenying this  statement, and  denouncing  non-co-operation as practically unsound,politically unwise, and suicidal for students.  He  told  Gandhi  lie  was  opposedto movement in its entirety.   Non-co-operation could  not continue to  lie non-violent.Swami  Biswanand active in coalfields and  endeavouring to form labour /union andthen to secure increased wages, aim being  minimum wage  Re. 1. 8 a day.   Twostrikes  occurred, but men have now returned  to work.  Railway Board  has receivedalarmist reports  of possible  general strike of  coalfields  between  .12th and  22nd.Precautions being taken in consultation with India Mining  Association and  local governments.  Miners&apos; wages being raised somewhat.   Miners have no organisationnor funds to support long strike.     Central Provinces. Extremist leaders  touring  Province to collect  funds forensuing Congress.  Practical  non-co-operation  making very slow  progress, thoughunrest developing among schools at Jubbulpur. H Gandhi shortly expected in Province,and further efforts will be made against schools, but education authorities anticipateonly temporary effect.   Voting in elections  undoubtedly affected  by non-co-operationmovement.  In some constituencies extremists secured  election of men of straw, andnew  Council   will contain several  unsuitable  members.  Khaparde, in  spite  ofpersecution by non-co-operators, elected to Council of State.     Assam. Manifesto condemning non-co-operation published in Assam, signatoriesincluding leading men of Sibsagar and Lakhimpur. and four great Abbotts of AssamValley.   Elections not eliciting much interest.   Attempt to start Madrassah. at Sylhetin opposition to Government Madrassah  not made much progress.     Punjab.  Election  returns up  to 7th  instant show  that in rural constituenciespolling  averaged  about 36 per  cent, of electors on rolls.  But  voting in urbanconstituencies  so far reported, and particularly  in Lahore and  Amritsar, has  beenfailure  as  result  of interference  by organised bands of city hooligans employed bylocal non-co-operative leaders.   In Lahore, voters, candidates and officials commonlyintimidated, and in some cases assaulted, one seriously.  One honorary  worker at pollsubjected to four  hours&apos; insults from crowd of 8,000, in  spite oJ  protection of armedpolice.  He and police inspectors  escorting him stoned on leaving booth, and crowdattacking  his  residence tired  on by his son,  four persons being slightly wounded.Firing excited crowd, who  tried to  break into house.   Timely arrival of police and non-co-operation leaders prevented, further trouble, Kite-blew taking  crowd away and holding indignation meeting.. We have  asked Local. Governments to report action.taken against  intimidators,  and  have pointed out necessity of  prompt  prosecution.under sections  143 and 171(C)  Indian Penal Code.  Report received from a Sikh policeofficer states that feeling in.Punjab  very bitter,  specially tendency  of poor people toinsult and. humiliate the rich.   Recommends formation of  moderate  Sikh Association-among Sikhs, and  Steps now taken  by  Sunder Singh  and  other  influential Sikhs to start daily Sikh papers ou lines of Leader of Allahabad, with view to impress on Sikhsnecessity of formation of moderate Sikh Association.   Thirteen professors of KhalsaCollege, Amritsar, have  resumed work in  consequence of  withdrawal of government control.  Tilak school  of politicians established  at  Lahore  under  directorship  ofLajpat  Rai, to which  Wedgwood has subscribed Rs. 500  in a letter eulogising  itsinstitution.  Objects to  include training of political workers with object apparently ofestablishing training for non-co-operating students of Punjab, as  Muhammad  Ali&apos;national University at Aligarh will for United  Provinces.     Delhi. Unpleasant development this week at funeral  of Khan  Bahadur MaidviAbdul A had, trustee  of Aligarh  College, who has always  been strong  supporter ofGovernment.  Family warned not to take corpse to June Musjid for  usual  prayers.On way to burial ground funeral party met mob led by  volunteer organisers and forcedto take  corpse back to house.  Abuse hurled at deceased as title-holder and question raised whether he could be buried in Mohamedan burial ground.  Relatives appealed to authorities  and police taken to spot..   Eventually announcement made by relativesthat deceased had repented on death-bed and  on this  purely suppositions assumptionobstructors professed  themselves willing  to  assist in  funeral,  which took place.En route, intimidation, of title-holders and voters also carried on, and  especially mob
collected  at  house of loyal  Rai Bahadur,&apos; reported  to have  died, and refused to&apos;disperse.  Chief persons responsible  for rowdyism at  Maulvi Abdul. Ahad&apos;s funeralbeing prosecuted under section 207, Indian Penal Code.   With a view to check thishooliganism and dangerous extension of volunteer movement, which would lead to serious rioting and conflict  with police, and. to restore confidence amongst large bodyof well-wishers  of Government  and prominent  men, Chief Commissioner, with our full approval, has extended to Delhi part two of the Indian Criminal Law amendment act, 1908, and declared, unlawful four volunteer associations founded this year,   liehas (? also) with our  sanction  applied Seditious  Meetings Act to Delhi for further period of  six months.  (? Since)  28th October, when  previous  application  of  Act toDelhi expired, there  has  been a growing abuse of public speech and.  meetings ofgrossly seditious character  being held to encourage disloyalty and to intimidate loyalcitizens.   We have tndicated  fo Chief  Commissioner the importance  we attach toprompt  prosecution  in all  cases of  intimidation.   Election  turned into  farce  byintimidation of candidates  and voters, and return of  sweetmeat seller,  who paradedstreets on donkey.  No prominent man takes  lead  in Delhi,  and developments now reported chiefly work of city hooligans who have got out of  hand and were terrorisingrespectable citizens.   Action taken under two Acts mentioned above, and prosecutionswill, we hope, have salutary effect.     United Provinces.-In Agra, some  voters  roughly handled.   Rubbish thrown atrespectable voters and superintendents of police.  Rowdy crowd consisted of studentsof low caste of Mohamedan and riffraff shouting &quot; Mahatma Gandhiji Ki Jai.&quot;   leader of 9th instant vigorously denounces  disgraceful exploits of non-co-operators at Agraand Meernt, also at  Cawnpore, where  Hartal, enforced to commemorate death  ofMuhmud Hasan.  Leader says :&quot; Non-violent non-co-operation has begun to emergeinto violent non-co-operation despite saintly advice of Mr. Gandhi.&quot;     Generally  in  United Provinces  polling fair, and  especially in Lucknow, and  nodisturbances reported  elsewhere.   From Agra and  (? word omitted)  sensationalreports  received of  disorderliness   at  elections show how  imperfect  is  Gandhfspretended control.  He issued  message hoping that  no voter would go to polls  on-30th, but  that  there  would be no&apos;  undue  interference with those wishing to vote.Events, Lahore and Delhi and  Agra, ironical commentary on  this message, described by Independent-  as &quot; voice of the uatioiPs  soul.&quot;  Poor polling reported from some places will be claimed as triumph for non-co-operation, though  this is in many placeslargely due to apathy.     Burma. Considerable unrest among students&apos;  (? community), Rangoon, of whichdetails  separately reported by  Education Department.  Local Government ascribessituation  to preaching Indian agitator, Swaini Sracldhanand, and  does not regard(? episode) as serious political manifestation.     General. With  the  exception of  unpleasant  development of  hooliganism  and social boycott successfully adopted  in some quarters, situation unchanged and  non-co-operation movement  certainly   not  gaining  strength  with  educated   classes.Wedgwood; in interview Calcutta, condemned  non-co-operation movement  as  hatefuland wished;it  at end and. hoped Nagpur Conference would convince  Gandhi of itswickedness.   We have received, full  text of  opinion  of  Advocate-General, Bombay,. advising against prosecution of Gandhi, and as  promised in para. 3 of our telegramof 2-ith October, are  forwarding  copy by mail.  Andrews  has  returned to charge on policy of  segregation adopted in East Africa and. alleged that decision (&apos;? would  be)insulting  to Indian  self-respect.  Attention drawn to  recent statement in Gandhi&apos;s paper Young India  (? from its)  Baghdad Correspondent, describing inauguration ofGandhPs  non-co-operation campaign  and protesting  against  action of militaryauthorities  in  enrolling men of Indian labour corps into lighting units.  Facts  not- correctly  stated, as only ex-soldiers  in labour corps invited, to enlist as volunteers inbattalions, but matter of considerable political significanne.  Recruitment of military labour corps was only agreed to by Government of India in April last with reluctance, as military needs were predominant in Mesopotamia and on understanding that thereshould be  no  labour recruitment  in India  by civil  authorities  for  Mesopotamia. Reported from Rangoon editor and publisher Rangoon Mail, Halms (? word omitted), and charged under section 153A, Indian Penal (lode.
