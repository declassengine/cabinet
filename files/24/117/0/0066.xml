PART  I-THE   LABOUR  SITUATION.THE  GENERAL  SITUATION. General Survey of the Week.     The strike of the shipyard joiners-has continued during the week under review, and there is every indication that the dispute will be protracted.  The situation otherwise remains quiet, and is, in fact, easier than for many  weeks past.  The threatened strike of tramwaymen has  been averted for the time being by the decision of the Minister to establish a Court of Inquiry under Part II of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, to investi- gate the position with regard to the men&apos;s claim for an advance in wages of 12s. per week ; and the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association have also agreed to suspend their strike notices  against those electricity supply undertakings who refused  to accept the wages schedide for technical staffs, supervisors, and others, drawn up by the National Joint Board for the Electricity Supply Industry, in view of the fact that the Ministry of  Labour have undertaken to enter into negotiations with the recalcitrant bodies.     Another  noteworthy event of  the week, indicative of a more conciliatory attitude at the present time, is the acquiescence of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, who represent mainly the shipbuilding unions, in the suggestion of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos;  Federations that the unions&apos; claim for a wage increase of 6d. per  hour  should be adjourned  for six months,  on the ground that the industry in its present state is unable financially to  bear the strain which the increase would involve. Meanwhile a proposal is under consideration for setting up a joint committee, representative of employers  and employed, to investigate the possibility of the adjustment of wages on the basis of  fluctuations  in trade. Similar  proposals were made to the Amalgamated Engineering Union and  the National  Federation of  General Workers, but these  two organisations  have  not yet come to any decision in the matter.    Public attention  has been concentrated on the unemployment position, which grows steadily worse,  the number of persons registered as unemployed on the 10th December at the Employment Exchanges in  the United Kingdom being 591,074, as compared with 565,703 on the 3rd.    The unemployment question was also raised in the House of Commons on the  18th and  the 20th; and on the  21st the Minister  explained the Governments  proposals for dealing  with  the problem.   These  proposals will be  referred to in detail in next  week&apos;s Eeport,  but attention is drawn to the Governments further  attempt to overcome the deadlock with the building trade unions, referred to below, by undertaking to pay to theunions concerned, provided they agree to admit and train not less than 50,000 ex-Servicemen, a grant  of  5 for each man so admitted  and trained.  The Minister also introduced the Unemployment Insurance (Temporary  Provisions Amendment) Bill to amend Section44 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, by rescinding the condition that not lessthan four contributions must  be paid in  respect of an employed person before he canreceive unemployment benefit, and substituting therefor a minimum number of weeks ofemployment since the 31st December, 1919, or since the 4th July, 1920.  This amendmentwill remain in force until the  31st March, 1921.    Apart from anything which may develop from  the Minister&apos;s proposals referred to above, the deadlock with the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives over the proposals of the Government for the employment of ex-Service men in the building industry continues.  The Minister invited the representatives of the building trade unions to meet him on the 20th to discuss the matter further, but a full conference of the joint executive councils of the societies affiliated to the Federation decided that no useful purpose would be served by  sending a deputation to the  Minister, on the ground that &quot; the deputation not having executive power could only act in a consultative capacity.&quot;  At the same time the conference undertook to consider and reply to the proposals if they were communicatedto them, and  the Minister forwarded them to  the Federation on the 18th December.
The General  Situation-continued.    With regard to the political aspect of the Labour movement, attention may be drawn to a joint meeting of the National Executive of the Labour Party and the parliamentary labour Party on  the  16th December, when the Joint Labour Commission  of  Inquiryreported the result of their recent  visit  to Ireland.  The Prime  Minister received adeputation from the joint meeting the same evening.  The &quot; All Ireland &quot; Conference,convened by the Executive Committee of the National  Union of Railwaymen, met inDablin on  the 21st December, when it was unanimously decided to resume work forthwith,provided all dismissed men were reinstated.    The Labour Gazette cost-of-living  index  number for  the 1st December was 169, ascompared with 176 for the 1st November, and 164 for the 1st October.   The decline was mainly due to the reduction of id. per lb.  in the price of sugar, which took effect during november, and it is particularly noteworthy as, with  the exception of short breaks inOctober, 1917, and from March to July, 1919, the figure has risen steadily since  the endof 1914.    The House of Lords amendments to the Women,  Young  Persons  and Children(Employment) Bill, and the Women and Young Persons (Employment in Lead Processes)Bill, were agreed to by the House of Commons on the 15th and 16th December, respectively,and the Bills are now awaiting the Royal Assent.  Copies of the correspondence between theMinister of Labour and the  National  Federation of Building  Trades Operatives on  theemployment of  additional ex-Service  men were presented to  both Houses  on the 20thDecember.  The Unemployment Insurance  (Temporary  Provisions Amendment)  bill passed through all its stages in the House of  Commons on the 21st, and was read for thefirst time in the House of Lords on the 22nd.The Unemployment Position.    The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policiesremaining lodged for the week ending the 10th December was 219,933, made up of 219,273lodged by men and 660 by women.  In addition, 3,901 policies remained lodged by workers on short time, 3,857 by men and 44  by women.    On  the 10th  December, 245,914 unemployment books, 140,072  for  males  and105,842 for females, remained lodged by  workers  under  the  Unemployment InsuranceAct.   In addition, 84,184 books remained lodged by workers  on  short time,  37,653 bymales and 46,531  by females.    The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges and a detailed  analysis of the unemployment position will be found on p. 713.    [NOTE. Owing to the incidence of the  Christmas holidays the remainder of Part I hasbeen held over until the next issue.](B 16777)4112
PART   IL-THE   WORK   OF   THE   MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL  RELATIONS  DEPARTMENT.               ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.    Blastfumacemen (Middlesbrough). The  National Council of Iron Masters  and theNational Federation of Blastfurnaccmen have asked the Ministry to appoint an umpireto arbitrate on a dispute  on the holidays and week-end wages of  blastfurnacemen atMiddlesbrough.    Time lost by Apprentices owing to Strike (London, Brighton and South Coast Railway). The National Union of Foundry Workers requested the department^ intervention regardingthe refusal  of the London,  Brighton and South Coast Railway Co. to allow the time lost by their foundry apprentices  who took part in the moulders&apos; strike.   It was urged thatthe other railway companies had allowed this time to count for purposes of annual incre-ment  and apprenticeship.   The company, however, stated that they granted the advance to apprentices only after one year&apos;s working, and time lost by apprentices was not includedin the year&apos;s working.  This system applied to all apprentices in their employment. any concession to their apprentice  moulders  would place them at an advantage  over theapprentices in the company&apos;s  other shops.  Owing to the intervention of the department,the general manager agreed to meet the secretary of the union, with the result that thecompany have agreed to allow half the  time the apprentices were  on strike  to counttowards their increment.    Electricians in Railway Workshops [Ireland) -A claim was made that electriciansemployed at the works of  the Midland Great Western Railway Co. should receive the dublin district rate for electricians in the building industry, namely 2s. lfd. per hour fora 44-hour week.  The Industrial  Court  held  that  the engineering trades  district ratefor electricians should be applicable, namely,  4 9s. 5d. per week of 47 hours.  (AwardNo. 570.)    Optical Instruments. The sub-committee of the Interim Industrial reconstruction committee appointed to administer the apprenticeship scheme met on the 14th December,and drew up a scale of percentage rates for indentured apprentices, based on the presentadult  minimum.   This scale will be recommended to the Committee  on the  5th  January.Messrs. Negretti &amp; Zambra  have given formal notice of their intention to terminate thewages agreement of December, 1919, which expires this month.                   BUILDING AND WORKS  OF CONSTRUCTION.    Rates of Wages on Public Works Contracts. The chairman and certain members  ofthe Joint Committee of Civil Engineering and Public Works Contractors had an interview with officers of the department on the 17th December.  The deputation stated that theFederation of Civil Engineering Contractors and the Public Works Contractors&apos; Associa-tion had been moving for some time in the direction of establishing their industry as onedistinct from the building industry, with their own rates of wages and working conditions.They  were informed that the Building Labour Committee, and the  departments repre-sented upon it, had for a long time adopted the view that the construction of roads and sewers in connection with housing schemes,  and the laying of cables under General PostOffice contracts, was work distinct  from building  work, and that the rates and conditionsof the building industry were not  applicable.  The fixing of the rates and conditions forthe public works and civil engineering contracts, however, was a matter which could onlybe undertaken by those concerned in that industry, and in arranging these matters the associations represented by the deputation would have to take their part.    They also stated that they hoped to arrange a meeting with local authorities in the birmingham area in the first  week in January, in order to reach some understanding forsecuring common action in establishing the separate position of the public works industry.
A similar meeting Avould probably be held in Manchester at an early date, and they would inform the department of the terms of any arrangement made.    The question was raised of the conditions under which the works in connection withthe Government road programme for the relief of unemployment were being earned out.They said that they had made representations to the Ministry of Health and to the Ministryof Transport to the effect that these works should be carried out as far as possible by con-tract, on the ground of economy, and that the rates of wages and conditions observed shouldbe not higher than those prevailing in the district for public works.  They were told thatthe Ministry of Transport had been invited to appoint a representative on the  building labour Committee, and that by this means the wishes of the deputation would probablybe met, at any rate as regards wages and working conditions.    Building. The Management and Costs Committee of the Industrial Council met onthe 16th and the 17th December, and decided that no further steps will be taken to proceedwith the report already considered by the Council, but that an endeavour will be made todeal, as separate matters, with a scheme of unemployment pay,  a  minimum system ofaccountancy and costing, and a system  of superannuation, regularisation of demand for labour, and its decasualisation.    On the 17th December, resolutions were  adopted to consider in the first place  theprovision of a supplementary scheme under the Unemployment Insurance  Act  to coverunemployment, as distinct from  intermittent  unemployment through  stress of  weather, Nsickness, or accident, and that the basis of the  proposals should be to provide for  a benefitof 45s. inclusive of the State Benefit of 15s., the funds to be found by joint contributions from employers and operatives.    The Administrative  Committee met on the 16th December, and  decided  that  thesecretaryships, which are both vacant,  should be carried on in future by one secretary,to be found, if possible, from either section of  the Industrial Council.  It was announcedthat the Royal  Institute of British Architects and  the Society of  Architects had eachnominated four members to serve on the Council in an advisory capacity.    The chairman of the Resettlement  Committee  moved  a resolution that &quot; a generalexpression of opinion having been made  that much building work has been withdrawn orwithheld owing to the high cost,  it appears to this committee that an exhaustive inquiry should be made into these allegations.  We, therefore, request the Council to consider thismatter with a view to having such a question investigated, and we consider it of greatimportance to the building industry.&quot;    Heating and Domestic Engineers. The Emergency  Committee  of  the  Council  meton the 15th December, and considered the situation arising from the demarcation disputeon the Blackley housing scheme as between the National Union of Operative Heating and domestic  Engineers  and the United Operative Plumbers&apos;  Association.  The employerwhose firm is involved in  the dispute informed the committee that he had been before the manchester Housing Committee, and had stated that he was not in a position, without theinstructions of his association, to say whether  the work could be carried out in the futureby plumbers.  The workpeople&apos;s secretary stated that the two  associations had met  theParliamentary Committee of the  Trades Union Congress on the 14th December,  but thatthe plumbers&apos; association had refused to consider the dispute at Blackley, claiming thatthey were unable to  discuss anything but amalgamation before the  Parliamentary Com-mittee. The&apos; plumbers&apos; association, however,  undertook that their executive committeewould consider, on the 21st December whether they were prepared to submit the  Blackleydispute to the arbitration of the Parliamentary Committee.  The Emergency Committeeof the Council, therefore decided that the employer should not meanwhile recommencethe work, but that if negotiations fail the heating and domestic engineers should commencework on this site again on the 3rd January.              PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC  UTILITY SERVICES.    Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales). The National Joint Council met on the 17th December.  A report on proposed scales of salary for men and women sanitary inspectors was discussed, a representative of  theMinistry of Health being present;  further  consideration  will be  given.  The Councilresolved that in future no salary scales should be adopted for any area until the ProvincialCouncil for that area had been given an opportunity of expressing  their views.  It wasdecided to urge upon the  Ministry of Health the necessity of empowering local authoritiesto pay subscriptions to National Provincial Utility Councils,
    A conference of representatives of the local authorities in Somersetshire, Gloucestershireand Wiltshire, and of the staff associations concerned, on the 13th December, decidedthat a Provincial Council should he established for the area.  A constitution was adopted and the allocation  of seats arranged.      *  -    Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual  Workers (England and Wales).-TheProvincial Council for the Eastern Counties met on the 16th December.  The chairman and vice-chairman of the National Council attended  to endeavour to assist the Councjlto arrive at a decision on a schedule of basic rates for the various grades of local authoritiesin the area, over which a deadlock had arisen.  It was found impossible to reach agreement at the meeting,  but the  representatives of the local authorities agreed to consult theirconstituents as to the acceptance of the final application put forward by the trade union side.  It was agreed that, in the  meantime, it was open to individual local authorities or trade unions to negotiate on wages increases.    The Provincial Council for the Western Counties held their first annual meeting onthe 17th December.  Officers, were elected  for the  ensuing year.  A report on the work done by the Council was agreed, and is to be circulated to the local authorities in the area,and the trade unions concerned.  The financial difficulties of: the employers&apos; side, due to the lack of legal sanction for the payment of contributions by local authorities to the Council,Were considered, and it was decided, in view of the situation, that there should he nofurther meeting  of the Council until  March, in order to allow  time for  the matter to bere considered.  The trade union side promised to use what influence they might have inthe matter.    The District Council for Northumberland and Durham met on the 17th  December.Several  questions in dispute locally were determined.   In view of the intention of certainlocal authorities to withdraw from the Council, on the ground that the grading schemeand the  minimum rates  of pay laid down are not acceptable, it was decided to call aconference, early in  January,  of representatives of all local authorities in the area, todiscuss the objections raised.  The Grading Committee of the District Council will considerthe matters then raised and report to the Council.    The District Council for the West  Riding of Yorkshire, on the 16th December,  heldtheir first meeting since  the adjournment, sine die,  on the 21st  October. ; The Councilresolved to  recommend to  all local authorities in the area that  the existing minimum rates of pay be increased by one penny per hour, as from the first pay-day following the1st December;  and that, where any employee has been in receipt of  a special rate of pay above the minimum rate for  semi-skilled or special work, he shall continue to have such additional pay above the minimum rates now  recommended.    Electricity Supply.-The District Council for the South Coast Area, comprising Sussex,Hampshire and  Dorset, met on the 13th December.   A dispute had arisen between theBournemouth and Poole Electricity Supply Co. and the Workers&apos; Union as to the interpreta-tion to be placed on the schedule of basic rates and conditions.  The reduction of working hours from 55j to 47 had resulted in the workmen receiving less wages at the end of theweek, though the standard rate was increased from Is. 5d. to Is. Id. per  hour.  The unioncontended that the amount of cash received  should not be less than under the old con-ditions.  The matter was referred to the National  Council for settlement.    The District Council for the East Coast Area, comprising Huntingdonshire, Cambridge-shire, Norfolk, Suffolk and South Lincolnshire, met on the 16th December to consider theschedule of basic rates and conditions, which the employers&apos; side refused to accept, althoughit had been approved by  a properly representative  sub-committee.  The National council had been asked for their decision, and had recommended the adoption of the schedulewith some minor modifications.   The employers&apos; side  of the District Council refused toaccept this decision,  and were not disposed to go to arbitration, which was pressed for bythe trade union side.  It was agreed, however, that the  constituent authorities  shouldbe consulted as to the adoption of the latter course.    The National Council met on the  17th December.  Several important matters  weretabled for discussion including an application from the South  Wales and MonmouthshireDistrict  Council for advances for skilled and unskilled workers,  and also a  schedule of basic rates and conditions submitted for approval by the Greater London District Council,which involved  the new  principle of Id. per hour  extra for shift-workers.  As there wasnot a quorum on the trade union side, and, as both sides felt that insufficient time had beengiven for previous consideration, it was agreed to defer consideration of  these two matters to a special meeting of the  Council on the 11th January.
    The Council decided  in the case submitted by the South Coast District Council thatno increase in the standard rate laid down in the schedule should be given.    A conference of representatives of undertakings in the East Midlands area and of the electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association was held at Nottingham on the 16th December,under the chairmanship of a representative of the Ministry, to consider the situation arisingfrom their difference in regard to the  acceptance by the undertakings  of the schedule of salaries  and conditions of service recommended by the National Joint Board of Employersand Staff Members.   The conference arrived at an agreement.    Tramway. A special meeting of the National Joint  Industrial Council was held byinvitation of  the Ministry on the 15th December, under  the chairmanship of Sir DavidShackleton, in order to discuss the possibility of a settlement of the trade union side&apos;claim for an  increase of wages.  The employers&apos; side  were unable to depart from thedecision of their constituents not to refer  the claim to arbitration. In  the circumstances,the Minister has decided to establish a Court of Inquiry under the  Industrial Courts Act.    The Standing Committee of the Council met on the 16th December and considered anumber of appeals arising from the operation of the national agreement. Several decisions were made.    Waterworks  Undertakings. The Home  Counties District Council met on the 13thDecember. A number of anomalies arising out  of the grading  schemes adopted on the12th August were referred to the Grading Sub-Committee for consideration.                          GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.    Admiralty. The Industrial Council met on the 17th  December.   It was stated thatthe Admiralty, after further consideration, had decided that smoking facilities could not begranted in the Royal Dockyards.  Arising  out of a suggestion from  the trade union side thatcertain  smoking  facilities had been granted in  the industrial establishments of  anotherGovernment department, the Ministry of Labour were asked to obtain information regardingthe practice of other departments in this respect.    The Council decided, on the representation of the trade union  sides, that arrangements should be made for the establishment of a yard committee at Haulbowline Dockyard.                                  QUARRYING.    Quarrying. The  Executive Committee  of the Joint  Industrial Council met on the13th  December.   The Mines and  Quarries  Report  for 1919  was criticised.  The ChiefInspector of Mines is to be asked to receive a deputation  to discuss safety regulations andother matters.  Amendments to the conciliation and arbitration machinery were approved.The secretary had received copies of several agreements reached in the Granite and ChalkSections.  He drew attention to  Clause  2 of the constitution, under  which no decisionaffecting any section as a whole shall become operative until it has been approved by theNational Council.  It was agreed that this  clause should not be too  strictly construed.It was considered impracticable to establish uniform rates  throughout the country.    The Council met on the 14th December.  Clause 2 of the constitution  was discussed.It was agreed that, where a fundamental principle was involved, the Executive Committeeshould call a  special meeting of the Council to consider the ratification of an  agreement reached by a subordinate Council;  in all other cases, the ratification  could be taken for granted, as it would be intolerable if an agreement could not take effect until it had been formally approved by the National Council.  It was considered unnecessary to amend theconstitution in this respect at present.  The position of the Freestone Section was discussed,and the reasons for the hurried calling of the inaugural meeting of the Sectional Council,which proved abortive, were  explained. The status of the Yorkshire Area Freestone joint council, where a deadlock has been reached in the attempt to settle a dispute about wages,was criticised. It was chiefly with the aim, if possible, of settling this difference,  as by a kind of higher Court of Appeal,  that the Sectional National Council had been prematurelycalled together.  Two members of the Council were appointed to act  with the secretary as a Conciliation Board, and to endeavour to effect a settlement.                                  FOOD  AND DRINK.    Scottish Baking. The adjourned meeting of  the appointed Industrial Council was held in glasgow on the  16th December for the purpose  of considering  further the demand forincreased wages.  At  a private  meeting of the employers&apos; side a resolution was adopted
 adhering to a former offer of a general temporary advance of 5s. per week or, alternatively, arbitration.  The operatives insisted on an advance of at least 10s. per week, and stated that strike notices would be  lodged  on the 18th December, arbitration  being declined meanwhile.                                   TRANSPORT.     Docks. Sir Joseph Broodbank, of the Port of London Authority, in an interview on the 18th December, stated that the employers&apos; side of the newly formed National Council considered that the Council carried  out  the recommendation  of Lord Shaw&apos;s  Report, and did in fact form a Whitley Council for the industry.  In addition to the question of unemployment insurance, which was considered at the first meeting of the Council, and has  to be considered in detail by a small joint committee which  is meeting shortly, the Council will also  deal with the other subjects indicated in the Eeport.  As regards port committees, he was of the opinion that there should only be one such committee in each port, and that the broad plan of the Joint Industrial Council system, that the district and local bodies should deal with the same sort of subjects as the national  body,  but  in a  more local aspect, was the plan  that they intended to follow.  The position of the existing Port Labour Committees will require consideration in this  connection.   He considered, there- fore, that the department could regard the new Docks National Council as a Joint Industrial Council under the Whitley Scheme.  He suggested, however, that  the department should ascertain whether this was also the view of the trade union side.                                     POTTERY.     Pottery. The Executive,  General  Purposes,  and Finance Committee of the  Joint Industrial Council met on the 30th November, and re-affirmed their resolution of November, 1919, relative to the marking, under the glaze where practicable, of all ware with the country of origin.  A deputation of six, together with the five local members of Parliament, were appointed to interview Sir Robert Home  on the subject.  The operatives have decided to administer the Insurance Act through their union.     The Wages and Conditions Committee met on  the 6th December. The report of the visit to the Gypsum Association was accepted, inasmuch as an additional 40 tons of plasterper week has been promised.  The position is to be reviewed in three months&apos; time.  records of progress as to the placing of apprentices under the Interrupted Apprenticeship scheme were submitted, showing the number apprenticed to be 65.   The report was accepted  as satisfactory.                                    TEXTILES.    Carpets. The Joint Industrial Council  met on  the  16th December.   The Scottishemployers, who recently  seceded from the Council, submitted for consideration a -draft constitution for a  District Council for  Scotland, with autonomous powers in matters  ofwages and conditions of labour, which had been prepared by the employers and operativesjointly.   the  Scottish employers were not present, but were represented by their secretary.In their absence the Council refused to consider the draft constitution, but decided thatthe other two districts should formulate their proposals for District Councils, and that thethree drafts should be considered at a special  meeting which the Scottish employers wouldbe invited to attend.    There was a long discussion on the subject of contracting out of the UnemploymentInsurance Act.  The employers were generally opposed to the principle of contracting out,but were prepared to consider the question further at the next meeting.    Scottish Hosiery. Arising out of the issue of notices by employers in accordance withthe terms of the resolution of  the West of Scotland Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Associationof the 24th November, to the effect that contracts of service would be terminated as fromthe 11th December, and workers would be re-engaged  as from the  13th December at the reduced rates, about 1,000 hosiery workers in  the Dumfries district refused to resume  work under the new conditions.  A special meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 14th December.   The employers&apos; association were invited by the department to suspendnotices  pending  consideration of the  question by the  Council.  This course was not adopted.  The result of the meeting on the  14th December was  inconclusive.  It was,however, arranged that the liaison officer to  the Council should confer with the West ofScotland Association, at their annual general meeting  on the 22nd December, respecting the situation and the relationship of the Association to the Council.    .
    So far the only workers affected are members of the Workers&apos; Union.  The other unions concerned seem to be desirous of taking no action which would prejudice their claim to unemployment insurance  benefit.                      LEATHER AND BOOTS AND SHOES.    Boot and Shoe Manufacturing. The Unemployment Insurance Sub-Committee of theJoint Industrial  Council  met on the  16th December.  The draft  special  scheme and anactuary&apos;s report  thereon  were discussed.  Before a further meeting is held the actuaryis to furnish a scale of rates that  could be paid under rates  of unemployment varying from 3 per cent,  to 5 per  cent.                            PRINTING AND PAPER.    Paper  Making. The Interim Industrial  Reconstruction Committee met  on the18th December.   The depressed state of the trade  was discussed, and a  committee wasappointed to issue a statement showing the costs of producing paper, and the impossibility of reducing prices below their  present level.   It is hoped,  by these means, to restore confidence  to the market  and encourage customers to buy.  The committee were furtherinstructed to draw up another statement for submission to the  Government.    The draft constitution for an Industrial Council was discussed  and adopted.  Norepresentation is given therein to any of the general workers&apos; unions ;  it was suggested,however, that they should be given representation on the Southern District Council, whenformed, since their membership is said to be confined to paper mills in this area.                           PROFESSIONAL   WORKERS.    Insurance Workers. The strike  of insurance officials against the General AccidentFire and Life  Assurance  Corporation continues;  a mass meeting, said to represent amillion members of 18 non-manual professions,  was held on the 15th December.  Resolu-tions were passed protesting against the action of the Corporation,  urging the Governmentto set up a Court of Inquiry under, the Industrial Courts Act, and  affirming the urgent necessity of setting up Joint Industrial Councils for non-manual professions.

The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met on the13th December, and discussed an application from the trade union  side for  a 15s. per weekincrease in wages,  with proportionate increases in allowances.  The employers met thedemand by stating that owing to trade depression,  it was quite impossible to grant anyfurther increase at the moment.  On the suggestion of the chairman, consideration of theclaim was deferred until after Christmas, and it  was arranged that a special meeting of theCommittee should be summoned early in the New Year.

The  Administrative  committee agreed to recommend the  Board to take no further steps to co-operate with JuvenileAdvisory Committees in respect of the  training and. employment of juvenile workers,and to recommend the Board to adopt a scheme of learnership for juvenile  female panhands, in setting only.   The committee further  agreed to recommend the Board for thetime being not to fix general minimum piece-rates;  the determination of piece-rates tobe paid to be left to the operation of the proposed piece-work basis time-rates.  The question of foreign competition in the trade was considered, and it was agreed torecommend the Board to adopt the following resolution :-          &quot; That while the British brush trade requires no protection against those countries where condi-       tions are comparable with those prevailing in this country, the Government be requested to prohibit       the entry into this country of all brushes made in countries where the prevalent rate of exchange or       low rate of wages produce conditions under which it is impossible for English manufacturers to       compete, except under licence to be given where it can be shown that the  brushes in question, or       suitable substitutes, cannot be procured in this country, the licensing authority to be the Administrative       Committee of the Trade Board.&quot;    The committee also considered a letter from  the Minister on the subject of the period for which permits of exemption  are granted, and decided that the Minister be informedthat the  existing practice  of the Board  is in  accordance with  suggestions contained inthe letter, and that they have no comments to make on the matter.Council to secure the postponement of the date of operation of the Women and YoungPersons (Employment) Bill.

General Department-continued.    Made-up Textiles Trade  Board (Great  Britain). The question of proposing to fixminimum rates of wages for male and female workers was considered by the Board, who,after discussion of the proposals submitted by the representatives of employers and workersrespectively, agreed to propose  the general minimum time-rate of %\d. per hour  for un-skilled female workers of 18 years of age and over, subject to an agreement later as to the classes of workers to be graded as skilled and unskilled respectively.    Flax and Hemp  Trade Board (Great Britain). After  consideration of the objectionslodged against their Notice of Proposal, dated the 31st August, the Board agreed to appoint a special committee  consisting  of four  members  from each  side of the Board, under thechairmanship of Professor Baillie, to advise as to when, economically, the trade is  in astate to fix and vary the proposed rates of wages.   The Board considered their correspond-ence with the Minister on the subject of the position  of oilers and sweepers in the trade,and agreed to request that a representative of the Ministry be instructed to attend thenext meeting of the Board to discuss the matter.    It was agreed that the Industrial  Fatigue Research Board be approached with an inquiry as to whether  they would be willing to make experiments in the trade for the purposeof determining  the effect of fatigue on output, and the effect of increase or decrease in working hours on output in the different departments.    At the request of the  Minister, the Board considered an inquiry as  to whether de-seeding, retting and  scutching were  within  the scope  of the minimum rates fixed by theBoard, and agreed to reply that  the operations in  question are not, in their opinion, withinthe scope of the Board.   It was agreed that a protest be made to  the  Minister in respectof delays which had  occurred in investigating complaints lodged with  the department asto the non-payment of the minimum rates fixed by the  Board.    The Special Rates Committee considered a letter addressed to the Board on the subjectof the legal obligations of an employer in the case in which one of the looms operated by a two-loom weaver is idle and agreed to recommend the Board to take no action in  respectof the matter.    Dressmaking and Women&apos;s  Light  Clothing Trade Board (England and Wales). TheAdministrative  Committee considered a letter from the Minister on the precise meaning of the terms &quot; fully qualified bodice, skirt, gown or blouse hands,&quot;  as used in Section II ofPart I of the Board&apos;s  Notice dated the 22nd November, and agreed to reply  that, in framing the section in question, it was the intention of the Board that a female worker who can take a bodice, skirt, gown or blouse  direct from the fitter, and make it up without super-vision, should be regarded as a fully qualified bodice, skirt, gown or blouse hand.    The committee considered a further letter from the Minister on the subject of proposedmodifications of the Trade Boards (Women&apos;s Clothing) Order, 1919, and of the specificationof the Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light  Clothing Trade  Board (England and Wales) asset out in the  Regulations made by the Minister on the 24th November, 1919.  they agreed that a sub-committee consisting of three members  from each side of the Board beappointed to confer on these questions with other Trade Boards concerned in the proposedmodifications,  or with sub-committees appointed by these Boards,  and that the  sub-committee should report on the matter to the Board.    Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board  approved,  withcertain alterations, a form of indenture of apprenticeship prepared by  the AdministrativeCommittee, and agreed that it be made a condition of the payment of the minimum ratesfor apprentices  that the indentures under which apprentices in future are  to be employedshould be in the form approved, and that the number of apprentices to journeymen inany establishment should be limited to certain proportions.    The  Board  considered a report from  the Administrative Committee on the steps which should be taken to secure the  registration of all boot repairers.   It was agreed thata communication be sent to the Minister pointing out that, in many parts of the country,the Board&apos;s determinations were not being complied with,  due largely to the fact that,owing to the lack of machinery for ascertaining the names and addresses  of all firms engagedin the trade, a large number of firms had not received the Board&apos;s Notices, and requesting that steps be taken to secure the compulsory registration of all persons  carrying on thetrade of boot repairing or boot making for the public.    The  Board  also  considered the report from the Administrative  Committee on the praticability of fixing general minimum piece-rates for machine finishing, and agreed to delay further consideration for six months.    A further report from this committee on the  revision of the anomalies in the generalminimum piece-rates was considered, and it was agreed to refer the report  back to the    (B 16777)                                                             4 X2
General  Department-continued.sub-committee with instructions to consider any amendments which may be sent to thesecretary by the individual members of the Board.  Representatives of the surgical boot makers were added to the sub-committee.     The Board considered a motion, on behalf of the representatives of workers, to  vary the minimum rates fixed by the Board, and a motion, on behalf of the representatives ofemployers, that the question as to whether any variation should be made in the minimum rates be referred in the first instance to the District Trade Committees for report.   It wasagreed  by a majority that the proposed variation of  rates be forwarded to the DistrictTrade Committees in the first instance.     The Board considered, at the request of the Minister, the draft definition of the tradeunder the proposed Trade Board for the boot and shoe retail distributive trade.   The Boardapproved of the proposed  definition with the exception of certain  operations, which they considered were included within the scope of the Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board.They agreed to suggest that these operations be excluded from the scope of the Boot andShoe Retail Distributive Trade Board.             FIXING AND  VARIATION  OF  MINIMUM RATES  OF WAGES.     Rope, Twine and Net  Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order,dated the  13th December, confirming general minimum time-rates,  piece-work basistime-rates and  overtime rates as varied for certain classes of female workers, and hasspecified the 31st December as  the  date from which  these rates  as varied shall become effective, the operation of the rates to be limited to four months from this date.           The general minimum time-rate as varied is lOfi. per hour for female workers, other than home-        workers, 18 years of age and over, when employed in the making of rope of l^-in. circumference or        over, or on processes preparatory thereto when carried on in the same factory or workshop.  The        corresponding piece-work basis time-rate as varied is ll\d. per hour.           The overtime rates as varied are to be calculated on the rates set out above in the manner set        out in the Ministers Order dated the 31st March, 1920.     Stamped and Pressed  Metal Wares Trade Board  (Great Britain). The Minister hasmade an Order, dated the 14th December, confirming general minimum time-rates and over-time rates as varied for certain classes of male workers, and has specified the 31st Decemberas the date from which these rates as varied shall become effective.           The general minimum time-rates for male workers, 21 years of age and upwards, as varied        range from Is. 8^d. to 2s. per hour for braziers, burnishers or drop-stampers ; from Is. %\d. to Is. 8^(1.        for dippers ; from Is. S^d. to 2s. for dippers who are also  bronzers ; and from Is. 8^. to 2s. O^d. for        brass polishers.  The rate as varied for annealers who can take charge of their own work is Is. 8 d;        rates are also fixed for similar workers under 21 years of age who can take charge of their own work.        The overtime rates are to be calculated on the minimum rates as varied by this Order in the manner        set out in the Ministers Order dated the 7th September.     Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (Scotland). The Board have issued a Notice of proposal, dated the 14th December, to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime  ratesfor male and female workers.           The general minimum time-rates proposed range from 65s. to 72s. 6.&apos;/. per hour for male workers,        and from 49s. to 55s. for female workers 21 years of age and over.  These rates are in respect of a        week of 48 hours, or, in the case of counting-house clerks employed in the wholesale trade, the number        of hours customarily worked, provided that it is not less  than 38.  The overtime rates proposed.are        double time for all hours worked on Sunday, on customary local holidays and on statutory holidays,        and time-and-a-half for all other hours in excess of 48 worked in any week.  In the case of counting-        house clerks employed in the wholesale trade the hours worked in excess of those constituting a week,     -   but not in excess of 48, must be paid for at the normal hourly rate.

General Outlook. Reports indicate that the industrial position generally is steadilygrowing worse, and that the depression affecting most trades is extending rapidly.   Onlyin the pottery trade and the carpet trade can the position be regarded as normal.   the combination of adverse factors which have retarded employment, and the prospect of longstoppages during the  Christmas holidays, tend to accentuate the note  of pessimism inregard to the immediate future.    The  position of the  cotton trade is particularly serious.  In the opinion of manyemployers and leaders of the operatives, there was never a period in the history of theindustry when unemployment was so pronounced in all its branches simultaneously.   Thedepression in the woollen trade appears to be most acutely felt in the Dewsbury, Ossettand Mirfield districts.   The reports  from these centres indicate that, while not one firmis  working  full time, many have closed down altogether until after Christmas.  In thelace trades, buyers are stated to be holding off in expectation of a further reduction inprices.  In the boot and shoe and hosiery trades, unemployment, already acute, is appar-ently  becoming more  serious, particularly in the Leicester district, where a number of firms are stated to be contemplating suspending all their employees.    Abnormal unemployment, due to lack of orders, is still a feature of the tinplate and steel industries, but it is reported from Sheffield that,  as the result of the placing of a  largecontract  by the  Japanese Government, Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., are about to start  theirarmour plate mill.    In the Metropolitan area unemployment is still prevalent in the unskilled occupations,such as those of porters, carmen and general labourers.   There is also a pronounced slacknessin the printing and engineering trades.    With regard to the shipbuilding and allied industries, the position in Scotland is not regarded as promising, owing to the cancelling of a large number of contracts.   On the tyne  work continues to hold out,  except as regards repair work, which is declining. Onthe Tees and the Wear a shortage of material is making employment somewhat irregular.On the Mersey there is some indication that shipyards are rather busier than during thepast three or four months, but the position is still far from normal.  Hopes are entertained,however, that the New Year will see an improvement in the position generally.    Industrial Developments. From Sheerness it is reported that Sir R. McAlpine &amp; Sons -expect to hand over the new factory at Queenborough to the British Window Glass Co.early  in  the New Year.  The factory, when in  full work,  should employ about 900workpeople.    The rolling mills at Woolston have been re-opened and a representative of the firmstates that he expects, in the  New Year, to start about 1,000 hands on motor work, alarge  percentage of whom, he hopes, will be ex-Service men.
 Employment and Insurance Department-continued.     Labour Reductions. Lowestoft report that about 80 workpeople will be thrown out of employment by the closing clown of the engineering works of Messrs. James Talbot &amp; Davison, Ltd.  Messrs.  J. S. White &amp; Co., Ltd., Cowes, shipbuilders, are discharging a number of workmen owing to cancelled orders.   At Woolston, Messrs. J. I. Thorny croft &amp; Co., Ltd.,  are discharging 400 workmen, chiefly marine fitters and boilermakers, owing to the completion of repair work on a liner.     Shortage of Ijabour. The  situation in the building trades remains  practically un- changed;  but  the supply of carpenters in the London area is in excess  of the demand owing to the shipyard workers&apos; dispute. A serious shortage of moulders is reported from Altrincham and Dumbarton.     Shortage of Material. Aberystwyth report that  a contract for the building of new woollen mills at Cardigan has been suspended indefinitely owing to lack of building material. A shortage of material  is also adversely affecting building operations at  Bathgate and Linlithgow.                        ...                                          f     Transport. The position  in regard to  transport  workers is fairly good at the ports in the South Wales district.   Shipping is very quiet at Grimsby and Hull and in consequence there is a very  large surplus of labour at both  these ports.  At the Copenhagen Oil Cake Mills, Poplar, delay is experienced in clearing the products owing to a shortage of railway wagons.     Miscellaneous. As  a result of the discussions of  the Divisional Councils, valuable assistance has been given to the Training Department by the managers of the Employment Exchanges, in notifying  vacancies for improvers, and, in some cases, for  trainees.  This assistance is especially helpful in rural or  outlying districts.   It may be  noted that the close co-operation of the executive officer of the Training Department at Walsall and the manager of the Employment Exchange at Wolverhampton has resulted in placing over 100  disabled ex-Service men for training.   The Divisional Director of Industrial Training is particularly grateful for the help he has received from the managers of the Exchanges in this  division. Women&apos;s Employment     General Situation. Another rapid increase has taken place in unemployment during the week.  Detailed reports from the  divisions all indicate increased unemployment and short-time arrangements.     Local Reports. The North-Western Division report little change.  Systematic short time is being worked in the cotton industry, and Exchanges in the textile areas are under- going great strain.   At Oldham, practically every mill has adopted the short-time working system.  Upwards of 1,500 claims for insurance benefit have already been received, and it is anticipated that several thousand more women will apply  during  the week.   At Farn-worth, 5,055 claims to benefit have been taken in the women&apos;s department of the Exchange ;at Bolton, 2,574 ; and at Openshaw, benefit was paid on the 10th December to 1,127 appli-cants.  From the Preston area it is reported  that, as and when  applicants qualify for benefit, from 20,000 to  25,000 workpeople, of whom five-sixths are women,  will lodge claims.  It is thought that short-time working in the&apos; industry will continue for two months at least.     General trade depression also continues in other industries throughout the division, as, for example, the sewing trades of all kinds including waterproof garment-making ; theleather, hatting, slipper, drapery, cardboard box,  rope, twine  and mattress trades.  at liverpool  all factory work, especially  cardboard box making, bag and sack making and mending, and tin goods work, is depressed.     The Yorkshire  and  East Midlands Division report increasing short-time working in all the textile  and clothing centres.   At  Brighouse approximately 800  women cotton operatives are working systematic short time and claiming unemployment insurance benefit.At Dewsbury, between 4,000 and 6,000 women are working not more than 24 hours a week.At Hebden Bridge,  unemployment increases, and approximately  half the workpeople inthe area are on short time. At Nottingham, the position is the same ;  all the large factories are on short time and many workers are totally unemployed.  In addition to the slacknessin the woollen and cotton textile industries there is depression in the wholesale clothing,lace, blouse, hosiery and leather trades.     No improvement is reported from the South Midlands and Eastern Division in thestaple industries of boot making, wholesale clothing, hosiery, and silk manufacture.
Employment and  Insurance  Department-continued.      0    At Leicester, approximately 40 firms have closed or are closing for a month or six weeks.During the week. 700  fresh claims for benefit have been made;  there are 1,040 currentclaims registered, and over 1,200 totally unemployed women on the register.  At Fleckney,several large factories have closed,  affecting 600 workers.  At Northampton, 673 women,mainly boot and blouse,workers, are  claiming benefit.    The West Midlands Division report increasing short time in all the staple industries,namely, engineering, motor and  cycle manufacture,  and the jewellery, silk, leather and clothing trades.  Amid the general depression,  the pottery trade is still brisk, and satis-factory reports are received from Burslem, Hanley and Longton.    No improvement has taken place in the serious unemployment in London.  In certain cases  there are small decreases in the live register, due to the Women having exhaustedtheir  unemployment benefit.  Attention  is  being drawn  to  the many married womenseeking work owing to the unemployment of their husbands.  In addition to the general depression in all factory employment, the depression in the dressmaking and  tailoringtrades shows no abatement.    Little change  is  reported from  the  South-Western Division.  Slackness continuesprevalent in all the clothing centres.  Eastville (Bristol) report that approximately 500unemployment insurance claims have been made by workers on short time.  At Gloucesterthe live register is 463, and many women are working short time.    It is reported from Gorseinon that men and women workers in the tinplate  industry have  received  28 days&apos; notice from the majority  of the local works, terminating on the1st January.   Approximately 360 women  will be affected.    The Northern Division report  that woollen mills at Darlington, the paper mills atSunderland, where 100 women are affected, and the ropery works at Willington Quay,are working short time.    From Scotland depression and short time continue to he reported in the woollen andtextile industries, and in the linen, calico printing, hosiery and jute trades.   At Dundee,about 20,000 jute workers are now on short time, working three days a week.  At Dunferm-line, it is stated that slackness in the linen industry is very serious, and systematic short time is expected.   This will affect approximately 2,500 women and girls.                       LOCAL  EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.    Constitution. On the 21st November  a letter was sent to the chairman of  each local employment  Committee whose term  of  office  expires before the  15th   January, 1921,stating that the period of the appointment of the committee was being extended to a date not  later than the 20th May,  1921, pending the decision of the department on thequestion  of reconstitution.  The number  of committees concerned was 91.   It  appears,so far, that they are willing to continue working, and  to assist the department  in everyway possible until their future is decided.    Unemployment. The committees continue to take energetic action in  urging  upon local authorities the necessity of taking in hand public works.  The Liverpool Committeeare of opinion that no solution of the unemployment problem will be  found  until allobstacles in the way of the admission of unemployed men into occupations where a shortageof labour exists are removed.  The Birmingham Committee have made several protestsagainst the dismissal of Employment  Exchange temporary staff and their  replacement byinexperienced ex-Service men, pointing out that the Exchange staff are already overworked.    Unemployment Insurance and Oid-of-Work  Donation. The question of  reducing thepresent waiting period continues to be raised by Employment Committees.  The HackneyCommittee are of opinion that a large proportion of the women applicants are not genuinelyin need of unemployment benefit.  The Maidstone Committee recommend that  the PoorLaw authorities should be compelled to pay all unemployed persons an allowance equal tothe amount paid by the department.    Ex-Service Men. The problem of the unemployable disabled ex-Service men continuesto occupy the attention of committees.   The Inter-departmental  Committee  preside over by Sir Montague Barlow recently sought the advice of Local Employment committees on certain specific points in this connection.   A questionnaire was issued at the beginningof December, and the committees generally have taken considerable trouble to  give theinformation required.  The opinion continues  to be expressed  by various committeesthat the best solution  of the problem  is to pay all disabled men who are unemployable, by
reason of their disability, a pension sufficient to maintain them in comfort, and thus keep them off the labour market altogether.    Women. Resolutions on the subject of the adverse effect of Trade Board rates on theemployment of women continue to be received.  The Plymouth Women&apos;s Sub-Committeeassert that the rates fixed for the wholesale clothing and laundry trades constitute one ofthe main causes of women&apos;s unemployment locally.    General. Arrangements were recently made for the National Clearing House Gazetteto be exhibited in the Exchanges.  Several  Employment Committees have now pressed for its exhibition in public libraries as well,  but the department are anxious to test thevalue of the present arrangements before any question of wider publicity is considered.    The inadequacy of present premises for dealing with the large increase in the numberof workpeople now using the Exchanges has  come up for consideration in a large numberof areas.   Employment Committees  are generally of opinion that the premises are entirelyinadequate.      OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE  BENEFIT.    Out-of-Worh Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 9th December, 1920,show 371,910 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  336,207 8s. 5d.     Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments  of  unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 3rd December, 1920, was 122,599, involving an amountof  79,748 7s. U.            DISCHARGED  AND  DISABLED  SAILORS  AND  SOLDIERS. National Scheme.     Up to and including the 15th December, 23,208 certificates have  been issued to em-ployers under the Scheme.   The undertakings given by these employers cover 254,682disabled ex-Service men.     The recent appeal to chairmen of Local Employment  Committees,  asking them toendeavour to obtain undertakings from local authorities not on the Roll, has resulted in alarge number of undertakings being received from these public bodies.                               JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.     Employment of Juveniles in Cinema Theatres. Representations having been made tothe department that the employment of boys and girls in cinema theatres in undesirableowing to the ill-effects of the long and continuous hours of work, the close confinement,and the heat and glare from the lantern, a preliminary inquiry into the conditions  underwhich juveniles are working in cinemas has been carried out by Juvenile Exchanges.  -     The majority of the reports agree that the hours are much too long.  An instance isgiven of a boy who works 80 hours a week, and others of juveniles working 12 hours continu-ously every day.   In the better-class cinemas  the hours vary from 40 to 48 weekly.  working conditions are apparently not unsatisfactory  in &apos;the most modern cinemas, but in buildingsnot specially designed for the purpose adequate ventilation is  said to be almost impossible.     A number of reports recommend that the employment of juveniles in cinemas shouldbe prohibited, but the majority, while agreeing  that many undesirable features  exist,especially in the  smaller  towns, consider that the occupation is not in itself unsuitable,and that satisfactory arrangements could be made to protect the juveniles engaged in it.     War  Scholarships in London. Through the efforts of the London Central JuvenileAdvisory  Committee, the London County Council have agreed to  set up special classes for a limited number of girls under  18 who may be awarded scholarships under the  Board of Education^ War Scholarship scheme.  The girls must live in the administrative area of the  London County Council, and  must have suffered loss  of educational  or industrial efficiency owing to the war.  The scheme is an extension of  the original War Scholarship scheme instituted by the Board in 1919, and confined to boys and girls who had attended the centres for unemployed juveniles during the period of demobilisation^  Formal approval has not yet been received, but unofficially the Board have informed  the County Council                      * See-this Report, No. 26, 12th July, 1919, p. 18.
APPOINTMENTS  AND  TRAINING.     APPOINTMENTS  AND  CIVIL  LIABILITIES  DEPARTMENT.                                  APPOINTMENTS.     Statistics. During the week ending the 10th December the Appointments Department placed 427 candidates for  appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 46,475.  Of these, 6,326 have been placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards.  Applications were registered from 702 ex-Service men and 19 civilians.   The number of candidates available for appointments on the 10th December was 11,441 ex-Service men and 1,380  civilians.  At the same date 1,200 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were  at the disposal of the department, 563 having been registered during  the week.     Reports from Directorates. The Director at Manchester reports that, notwithstanding the depression of every important industry in the  district, the number of placings during November 257 was larger than in  any month since April.  A meeting of representative Liverpool-business men, called by the Lord  Mayor, decided to make  an appeal to  the business community, in the first place on behalf  of disabled men, and his  Lordship  has addressed a letter on the subject to two or three hundred firms.  The communication  has been published in all the local papers.     The Controller of the Appointments and Training Branch (Ireland) reports that propa- ganda with reference to the Business Training Scheme will be opened in Ireland shortly. In the Ulster area there is a marked increase in the number of new registrations and re- registrations by men placed in temporary employment which has now terminated owing to the prevailing depression in trade.  In  Belfast a number of mercantile marine officers who have completed their training under the Training Grants Scheme are without employment, and  consideration is being given to a suggestion that a special panel be formed to deal with these and other men trained under the Scheme but  still unemployed.  -                    BUSINESS AND  PROFESSIONAL  TRAINING.    Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 10th December the Appointments Department received 33 applications for training under this scheme, of which 21 were for training  of the type provided by the department.  Deducting  cancellation-tions and withdrawals, 28,256 applications for training  of  this type have been received in all, and 49,947 for the types provided by other Government departments.  The Inter-viewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,563  applications,  of which 23,120 have been recommended.  The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, havereceived 21,988 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,170 cases.    Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 10th December the Appoint-ments Department received 240 applications for training under this Scheme, bringing thetotal number of  applications to 1,060, of which 101 have since  been cancelled.  Grantshave been sanctioned in 70  cases.  At the same date 251  &quot; live &quot; training vacancies were atthe disposal of the department, 96 having been registered during the week.    (B 16777)                                                             4 Ythat they will be prepared to grant 100 scholarships under the scheme.  It is proposedto start the classes early in the New Year.  Forty scholarships will be awarded to well-educated girls capable of becoming fully trained and expert shorthand typists;  the re-mainder will be allotted to girls prepared to take courses of training in domestic subjects.The scholarships carry with them substantial maintenance grants, and  it is probable thattravelling expenses to permit of attendance at the courses will also be paid.  The preliminaryselection  of the girls will be undertaken by the Local Juvenile Advisory Committees, thefinal choice-being left to a small committee on which will be represented the Board ofEducation, the London County  Council, the Ministry of Labour, and the institution atwhich the courses will be established.

                         TRAINING  DEPARTMENT.                             INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.    Statistics. On the 14th December, 25,146 men were in training, as  against 25,044on the 7th December  and 25,047 on. the 16th November.  The number of  men placed intraining during the week was  493.  There were 16,041  men awaiting training, the corre-sponding totals for the 7th December and the 16th November being  16,264 and 17,075,respectively.   The number  of men  whose training had  been completed since the 1stAugust, 1919, was 22,307, the totals for the 7th December and the 16th November being21,916 and 20,523 respectively.    Distribution of Men in Training. The number of men in training in InstructionalFactories has risen, during November, by nearly 1,000 and on the 30th November  over one-third of the men in training were receiving instruction under factory conditions.   Inall but three divisions there was a reduction in the number of men training in technicalschools and similar institutions.   There is also in most  divisions a certain falling off,  very marked in London, in the number of men training in employers&apos; workshops, due doubtlessto trade depression, which causes employers to hesitate to take men either for full-timetraining or as improvers..    Medical Examination of Trainees. An arrangement has been made with the Ministryof Pensions whereby all men under instruction in Government  Instructional Factories willbe examined to ascertain the effect of their training upon their health, and so far as possibleto minimise the chances of break-down during training.  For the present the examinationwill be made quarterly, and the names of any men recommended by the medical referee for transfer to a different form of training,  or for further treatment, will be referred to the divisional  director for appropriate action.    Basket Making. It is unfortunately necessary to wind up the Orsett Farm basketmaking scheme, but it will be possible to transfer the majority of the men in training to HareHall,  where a new class, with accommodation up to 25, has been arranged.   The remainderwill be able to finish their course at Orsett.    Hostels, Canteens  and Welfare. The Hillcrest Hostel, Birmingham, is to be kept open for the present in order to meet an anticipated demand for accommodation for men whoare to be trained as teachers at the Springfield College, Moseley.    In the 12 hostels for which the Ministry are more or less directly responsible, there arenow 446 men in residence, and two-thirds of the available accommodation is fully occupied.    Government Instructional Factories -There has recently  been marked  progress  infactory training in the Yorkshire Division, in which training  work has suffered seriouslyin the past from delay in the provision of facilities.   The Minister, accompanied by  theLord  Mayor of Leeds, has visited the Whitehall Road and the Woodhouse Lane Factories,and inspected the work in hand.  The Woodhouse Lane Factory had a very good recordfor sales during the month, and there are contracts in hand to the value of  1,350.    At Hull the number of men in training at the recently opened factory is now just under100, the numbers having been more than doubled during the past two months.  The two new Scottish Factories, at Edinburgh and Dundee, also show satisfactory increases ;  the.first has now just over,  and the second just under,  100 men in training.   The CardiffFactory has now 432 men in training.   There are contracts in hand to the value of  2,513,and the month&apos;s sales have been  very satisfactory.  This factory is taking an  important part  in the Mynachdy housing scheme.  Four houses  are already nearly  completed, andbricklaying has been  started  on six others.     National Trade Advisory Committees : Boot and Shoe, A meeting of the  Administra-tive Committee of the Boot and Shoe Trade Board was held on the 15th December,  when50 applications for training were approved.   A resolution Was passed, however, that thecommittee are unable to consider  any further applications for training at the present time,    Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Departmenthave dealt with a total of 950 cases, in 448 of which the training sanctioned is provided bythe Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments.Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 232 cases,and abandoned training in 43 ;  149 are still in training and 24 are awaiting training.
with the exception of those made to Local Technical  Advisory Committees before the30th November.    National Trade Advisory Committees:  Cotton. A resolution was passed by the Com-mittee at their last meeting that if, in the opinion of a Local Technical Advisory Committee,any trainee, before the expiration of his period of training, is earning and receiving the fullaverage adult wage of his occupation at the mill where he is working, the Local TechnicalAdvisory Committee may, subject to the consent of the Divisional Director, terminate thetraining allowance at their discretion.  This resolution has met with approbation from allthe Local Technical Advisory Committees.    National Trade Advisory Committees: Pottery. At the last meeting of the Committee,at Stoke, the question of the formation  of a separate National Trade Advisory Committeefor the stoneware branch of the industry was carefully considered.   It is hoped that earlyin the New Year a conference may be held between a sub-committee of the National TradeAdvisory Committee and representative members of the stoneware industry.  Since thepeople connected with the stoneware trade, although most  anxious to do all they possiblycan to help, cannot train men under the present Report for the Pottery Trade, they will he asked to draw up a second Report, and a strict line of demarcation will be drawn, to preventoverlapping between the china clay and the stoneware industries.    Local Technical Advisory Committees : Cotton. Owing to the great depression in thetrade and the fact that many of the mills are only working three days a week, manycommittees are raising the question of the length of training.   They state that it can hardly be expected that a man can become efficient within a definite limit of  so many weeks,  ifhe is only working three days a week.  They urge that training ought to be  extended until he has worked a sufficient number of days.    Local  Technical Advisory Committee:  Engineering. The inaugural meeting of theLocal Technical Advisory Committee at Walsall was held on the 13th December.   It wasagreed that 100 disabled men should be trained in the coremaking processes.    Local Technical Advisory Committee:  Gold, Silver and Allied Trades. The inauguralmeeting of the Rochester committee for watch and clock repairing was held  on the  13thDecember.  They agreed to commence with a class of ten at the technical school, and decidedto use their influence with the trade in the Rochester, Gillingham and  Chatham districts,in order to  provide work for the trainees.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.    Statistics. Up to the 15th December, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect  of 45,049  apprentices  under the 41 schemes approved.  Grants had  been sanctioned in respect of 43,110  apprentices, employed by 17,182 employers.  The  totalnumber of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 14,634.    Proportion of Apprentices to Journeymen-When the scheme was inaugurated, it was thought that difficulty  might arise in  cases where the  return of ex-Service  apprenticescaused the normal proportion of apprentices to journeymen to be exceeded.  This anticipa-tion has not been realised.  In many industries, indeed, owing to the practical cessation of apprentiship during the war and the general dearth of recruits, the question has seldom.arisen.  In certain instances, as in the Scottish baking industry, special arrangements havebeen made to allow the employment of returning apprentices in excess of the normal limit,.provided that no new  apprentices are taken until the recognised proportion has been restored.   Individual instances of an excess of apprentices have generally been amicablysettled with the unions concerned, or have even been accepted without controversy.    Progress of Training. An interesting light is thrown upon the methods of training injoinery and carpentry by the foreman of Messro. Lawson &amp; Co.,  Glasgow, building con-tractors, in referring to their apprentices under the scheme.   He is retaining them inside the workshops to enable them to secure better training.  Those who  are  put on outsidework are usually found of little use in the general work of the trade, whilst those who servetheir time upon inside carpentering are able subsequently to master the outside workquickly.  The employer and the foreman both complained that the journeymen give theboys little  or no assistance.     Unemployment. The general outlook in the furniture  industry  at Swansea is mostunpromising.  Nearly all  the factories  are reported to be full of unsaleable stock, because     (B 16777)                                                             4Y2
London manufacturers, who are similarly situated, are getting rid of their stocks in Wales,at prices considerably below the cost of manufacture.General Training.    Apprenticeship :  Building. In Scotland, a committee of the Joint Industrial Councillias been appointed to consider the alterations necessary to bring the scheme into line withthe Scottish Education Act.   A preliminary meeting has been held, and a small sub-com-mittee was appointed to go fully into the matter with the Scottish Education Department.    The Midland Federation of Building Trades Employers  have  circulated to all their members their decision to establish local apprenticeship committees, and have asked to beinformed  when committees  are  established.  At Hereford, a  committee  is alreadyadministering the local scheme, and boys are being apprenticed under it. A joint meetingat Derby, on the 1st December, decided to establish a  committee to work the national scheme, and a further joint meeting will be held to constitute it fully.   In the Tees-sidedistrict, further progress is reported with the assistance of the secretary of the employers&apos;federation.  At Berwick-on-Tweed the employers  are favourable,  but  matters are beingdelayed, because the operatives have no unions of their  own.  At Sheffield, Leeds andHarrogate the painting trade  has  already in operation a  scheme  of its own, on similar lines to the national scheme, and at Hull the attitude of the employers in this  branch  ismore favourable than in other  branches of the industry.   At Kings Lynn objectionshave  been  raised by both sides, chiefly by the employers;  but at a  joint meeting thelatter agreed, though with considerable diffidence, to appoint a sub-committee to considerthe application of the Scheme in the district.    Apprenticeship :  Farriery. A comprehensive  report on Scotland indicates similartendencies  to those at work elsewhere lack of definite training in  the workshops, almost complete absence of facilities for technical instruction, and a serious shortage of apprentices.On the whole, however, the employers seem alive to the needs of the situation ;  and everyfirm visited welcomed the departments inquiry.  The shortage of apprentices in scotland is aggravated by the dependence of the  large  towns on country-trained men.  A similarstate of affairs is found in parts of  England. Apart from general complaints of low wagesand heavy work, attention is drawn in Scotland to the influence of the low esteem in whichthe trade is held by the general public.  As regards dangers generally, an employer  in theSouth of England, described as  the &quot; champion farrier  of England,&apos;&apos; declared  that with proper care there should  be no accidents, but on a subsequent visit was found to have been too badly injured by a kick from a horse to interview the officer.    Apprenticeships:  Furniture. An inquiry is being carried  out into  the conditions prevailing in the industry, and  the available evidence indicates that it is being well received.In the West Midlands, all the firms so  far visited have welcomed the  investigation and showed every willingness to co-operate.    Training and General Conditions : Tinplate Trade. On certain works at embargo&apos;ed, theemployers are attempting to secure lads of 15 to  16 and  youths of 18 to 22 to train asbehmders,  furnacemen, cloublers and rollermen.    They  will start as  assistants  to theshearers, proceed from this to the position of second helper, and eventually be promotedto one of the skilled trades.  The action is the more satisfactory as indicating the beginningoi a new outlook in regard to training for the industry.  Hitherto,  efforts to produce any definite system have come to nothing.   The employers regarded  it as impossible, and thetrade unions apparently acquiesced in this attitude owing to the high wages earned  by thehoys, compared with apprentices in other trades.    \ Reference  to matters of interest to  the Appointments  and Training Departments willslso be found on pages 704, 708, 709, 711, 714 and 721.]
APPENDIX.                            QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT.      The following extracts from the Official Report  of the proceedings of  the House  of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.  Trade  Boards Act: Laundry Trade.      Mr. Wignall asked the Minister of Labour if he recently issued an order  authorising  a change in the method of payment in the laundry trade from the weekly system,  as estab-  lished by the Wages Board, to payment by the hour ; and, if so, is he aware that  this change  is  against the interests of the workpeople,  as  it re-establishes the  old  sweating system  which the Wages Board decided to abolish when they agreed to weekly payments.      Mr. Boioeiman asked the Minister of Labour if Trade Boards have power to fix weekly  minimum time rates, and if not, whether he will consider the desirability of introducing  legislation whereby such power may be given to them.      Sir M. Barlow : The facts are that certain proposals for  fixing weekly rates, regardless  of the length of time  that a worker was employed, were proposed by the Laundry Trade  Board.  My right hon. friend  took advice on the question whether these proposals  fell  within the provisions of the Trade Boards Acts.   He was advised that the power conferred  by those Acts is for fixing not wages, but rates of wages ; that is to say, it can be provided  that a worker shall not be paid at less than a given rate for any time during which he is employed, but it is ultra vires to fix tninimum earnings which a worker receives irrespective  of the number of hours he has been employed during the week or any other period.  So far as the question of casual labour is concerned, I should point out that it is  competent for a Board to fix one hourly rate for regular whole-time workers, a higher rate  for regular part-time workers, and  a still higher rate for merely casual workers.   In  point  of fact the Laundry Trade Board have fixed special rates for casual or  emergency workers.  By this means a Trade Board can undoubtedly discourage the undue use of casual  labour while not indicting onerous or impossible  conditions on employers or workers. (13th December).                            DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT.. Supply.     On the 18th December, the House of Commons considered the Supplementary  Esti- mates for the Ministry of  Labour, on a motion that a supplementary sum, not exceeding  3,500,000, be granted.  The  Parliamentary Secretary explained that  the main items involved were the contribution to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, amounting to about  1,300,000, and out-of-work donation for ex-members of the Forces, including merchant seamen, which accounted  for  6,100,000.  From these sums were deducted savings  of approximately  3,500,000, and Appropriations-in-Aid  of  500,000.   The savings  were mainly in connection with the training work of the Ministry.  They arose partly from the preference shown, under the Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme, for commercial rather than professional training, but mainly under the industrial training schemes.  The Parliamentary Secretary  explained that this latter technical  saving did not indicate  that the House would not be asked for the money as and when the necessity arose.   In the course of his explanation of why the money voted for training had not been spent, he  gave an account of the progress of training work, and mentioned the anxiety  of the local technical advisory committees in many trades to restrict the number of entrants, in view of their not unnatural anxiety as to the future.    In the course of the debate, Mr. Hogge expressed the view that it was impossible  to go on training men without insisting that industrial organisations should give them a fair chance of employment.  Mr. Devlin and Sir E. Carson pressed, from the point  of view especially of the Irish linen industry, the position of workers unemployed for four weeks before the Unemployment Act, 1920, came into force.  Dr. Macnamara, in his reply, dealtspecifically with this last point,  leaving the broader question of unemployment  for the debate expected in the following week.   He stated that the  representations made to himby several deputations had  been placed at once before the Cabinet Committee on Unemploy-ment, and he would press  the representations made during the debate.  The matter was receiving urgent consideration, but he did not want to raise false hopes.    The question was put  and agreed to without a division.
