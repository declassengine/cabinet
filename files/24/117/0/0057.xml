UD S&amp;T^LEMEHT IH LEV/Ib,        Me mo r a ndjinL by the gg o rotary__for bootl and^1.  There ia a specific and urgent creation of Land    Settlement in the island of Lewis, the answer to whioluis^    fraught with such grave consecuenoes that I do not feel    entitled to give that answer without the express authority    of the Cabinet,         The matter arises in this way,  lord Leverhulrae aboitv    two years ago bought the island of lewis.  He detests the    otofting system and dislikes all schemes of land settlements    His desire is to industrialise lev/is - to make it a second    Lancashire,  A large proportion of the people on the    other hand are passionately devoted to the land, and they    objeot to being industrialised.,3.       Lord Leverhulme came to me after he had bought the    island and had begun his development schemes, and asked me    to stay my hand for a time in the matter of land settlement,    in order that he might have a fair chance of carrying out    his industrial schemes,  and of convincing the people of the    island that the true solution of their problems lay along    these lines.  I thought the proposal net unreasonable, and    I have up till now refrained from taking land compulsorily    in Lewis,  And thus, as Lord Leverhulme declines to give    land voluntarily for settlement purposes, this extraordinary    position is reached - that Lewis - where the demand for-    land settlement is more urgent, than in     other part of    Scotland - is the only considerable area in that country    where not an acre of land has been made available to tne    people under the Land Settlement Act,          *                                          4.   Lord
                                                  -    266     Lord ^evorhulme proceeded with his industrial schemes -harbour improvement, road making, house building,  factoryconstruction and the like - and for a time all went well.His weekly wage bill for labour in the island approximatedto 53,000.  But vhat I feared - ana what I told LordLeverhulme I feared - happened.  Tv-o of his farms - Colland Orest - were raided by ex-eorvice men, who were tiredof waiting for land, and who took no interest in his industrialdevelopments,  $hereupon Lord Leverhulme closed down hisscheraos, and  3,000 a weak ceased to flow into the island.Further, he, re fused to resume hit-,  schemes till the land which had been illegally seized wa; vacated by the raiders.     The situation was so grave that, being disabled byillness from going myself, i asked the Lord Advocate to visit the island along with representatives of the Board ofAgriculture, to point out to the raiders that their conduct.penalised the whole population of the island, including otherex-service men, and to request them to leave the farms whichthey had illegally occupied, in or&amp;.;r to pave the way forthe resumption of Lord Leverhulme&apos;s schemes.  Reasonultimately prevailed, ana the raiders quitted the farmswhich they had seized.      I then asked Lord  Leverhulme to come and see me, andwe discussed the situation fully.   I requested him to putin writing the terms upon which he would be prepared to resume hie industrial schemes in the island.  He has done  so,and his letter is set out in Appendix ju     I then wrote to the btornoway  Town Counoil, the DistrictCouncil, the law agent for the  raiders, and Dr. Murray, M.P.,in terms similar to those set out  in Appendix B.     The replies which I received  are  set  out in Appendix C.
The position in Lewis is then briefly this. The two best farms for land settlement on the island are undoubtedly ?oll and Gross, which the raiders have recently vacated. Lord Leverhulme absolutely refuses to make those farms available for land settlement. He regards them as essential for the milk supply of Stornoway in the future. He is however willing to resume his schemes subject to two conditions:-

(l) That there shall be no more raiding for 10 years;

(2) That land shall not be taken from him compulsorily during that period.

10. It must be obvious that literal compliance with either condition is impossible. But with regard to the first Lord Leverhulme will probably be contented with resolution passed by the local authorities concerned and by specially convened meetings pledging the inhabitants to do their best to prevent raiding.  With regard to the second, it is of course clear that no Minister can bind his successor in a matter of policy such as this.  But I think that Lord Leverhulme would be content with a pledge from the Government that, during their term of office, no land  will be compulsorily taken from him for land settlement.

11. I regret very much that I have failed to convince Lord Leverhulme that land settlement on an extensive  scale would not in fact militate against his schemes, but, on the contrary, would probably facilitate and supplement them, by conciliating the section of the population which declines to look beyond the land as a moans of subsisten?. Such, however, being his attitude, I have now to elect which of the two policies I am to adopt.

12. The easier course would, no doubt, be to proceed with land settlement and so break with Lord Leverhulme. If all the
the available larger farms were sub-divided, the agitation  for land would automatically cease. But there would remain a very large number of persons unprovided for, and a dead level of poverty would be the lot of a large proportion of the population.  In short, the policy of land settlement, can at boat, only prove a palliative: it is not a solution of the problem.

13. On the other hand, it is possible that lord Leverhulme &apos;s schemes may, if they catch the popular inngination and succeed, provide a wide field of alternative employment, and bring prosperity to the island which no policy in the power of Government can achieve.

14. In those circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that Lord Leverhulme should have  his chance on his own terms. I cannot say that I am hopeful of success. I fear that if and when a public announcement is made that only a very small and local scheme cf land settlement is to proceed, raiding will be renewed, and Lord Leverhulme will cease his operations. This risk must, I think, be faced. But before taking a decision in the matter and announcing it, I deem it my duty to bring the matter before the Cabinet. I do so in order to affect my colleagues with knowledge of what is happening in the Hebrides and what is likely to happen, and also in order that I may have the advantage of their guidance in a situation which is full of difficulty and danger.

I need hardly say it is my desire  to  do  all  in ;:&apos;y power to assist in such a settlement as will leave  open tho way for lreoommonoomen&apos;c of the development work in Lewis,  which  I  was under&apos; the necessity of suspending on the outbreak of the raiding cf If arms last Spring, as follows:-1         I am prepared to rocommence work on  tho  Tolsta-IJesa Road,land on the Irnish Road-&quot;-I        To commence tho formation of tho modified scheme for  a Pishing Eatbour between Goat Island and the beech being that part of tho larger Harbour scheme which has been arprovod  by the  Stornoway Pier&apos;and Harbour Commissioners for first construction.-         When this Harbour is completed Stornoway will  possess the finest Pishing Harbour on the West Coast  and  Western  Islands  of Scotland, and I puiposo. but without at this.moment binding  myself to more than the above three works, tc organise for-the reaping  of the Harvest of tho Sea, out of which only can  permanent and  congenial employment for the men&apos;of lewis at remunerative wages bo  provided., This will include th-- prosing forward to complete:tion  in Storncway of th&quot;1 Canning V act or y in c our so of &quot;rootion,  tho Ic&quot; Works, and  tl)o &quot;instant frousing&quot; process, to enable fish caught  in Lewis ooao to be placed in perfect condition for delivery to the best  consuming markets of tho United Kingdom and tho Continent.

I would support tho Government inmaking Small Holdings or crofts cf, say, SO acres each orthoroabouts, on terms that would make such a ochomo within thoroach ox all those who so desire.

I commenced, this last summer, a most instructive &quot;object.lesson&quot; in reclamation on tho iirnish Moor, which I am informed by  \exports is proving quite successful, and I hope will show thopossibility of tho reclamation of wasto lands.       All I ask before I recommence development work is thatall illegal raiding of farina shall cease, and that the raiderswithdraw&quot;from tho illegal occupation of the raided farms, and thatI bo given to December, 1930 - say ton years - in which thesueoeS3 or failure of my schemes for development may he tested,before any farm lands arc scheduled for taking for crofts,       I regret it will not bo possible to recommence development work before the end of March or early April noxt, but if an agreement on abovo lines can bo arrived at by the help of your all powerful and friendly guidance, then no time need bo lost in getting to work as early as the the nocossary organisation and plant can bo gogother and made available lo for the &quot;work.

In view of the fact that the men who were in illegal occupation of the farms of Coll and Gress had given an have undertaking to remove on or before the 11th November, I/had a conference with Lord Leverhulme to ascertain when, and to what extent, His Lordship was prepared to resume his/scheme for the development of Lewis, and how far he was willing to co-operate with me in the matter of land settlement. As the result of this conference, Lord Leverhulme has written to me a letter, which he desires should have full publicity. You will notice that His Lordship, as a condition of resuming his development schemes, stipulates that all raiding of farms shall cease. This is obviously not a matter on which I am in a position to give an undertaking. It is the people of Lewis who alone can enter into, and guarantee the due fulfilment of, an understanding of this nature.

Accordingly, the terms of the letter should be placed before them for their consideration. For this reason, and because I know you are deeply interested in the matters dealt with in the letter, I think it my duty to forward a copy of it to you, as Provost of Stornoway, for the information of the Town Council and the community which they represent. When the council have had an opportunity of considering the terms of the letter. I shall be glad to be favoured with any observations they may wish to offer on the subject.

I am addressing a similar letter to the Chairman of the Lewis District Committee of the County Council.

Chambers,  53 George Street,Edinburgh,  19th November, 1920.Dear Mr. ,hmro,                   LEWIS ^ LAND SETTLEMENT,    I am much obliged for your favour of 16th instant,  andenclosure,    My clients consented to withdraw from Coll and Grossso as to enable the Board of Agriculture to deal with theirsettlement on the lands.   .Notwithstanding all our efforts tobring about a friendly understanding, it appears from his letter tc you of 11th instant that Lord Leverhulme stillIntends to run away from the point under a smoke-screen ofvague promises as to minor industrial developments that mayor may not mature within the next decade.   The question is -&quot;Are these Farms to be made over by him to the Board?&quot;   Ifnot, it is clear the Board must step in at once.   Should, theyfail to do so, they and the Government will , in view of what has taken place, be in distinct breach of faith with my clients.    Lord Leverhulme is under a.great delusion if he thinksthe landless are going to start reclaiming his barren moorsfor him, while thousands of acres of good land are lyinguntilled at their doors.                           Yours sincerely,(Sgd)  D.  SHAF.
