i 3 &quot;*4 o                     y%SECRET.K.K. 33.E SITUATION  IN THE MIDDLE  EAST.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.    I must draw the attention of the Cabinet to the situation which has now devolped in the Middle East.  The unfortunate course of affairs has led to our being simultaneouslyout of sympathy with all the four Powers exercising local influence there.    (i.) We are at variance with the Russian Bolsheviks for many  grave reasons ;  aud           he is  indeed  a  sanguine  man  who supposes  that  a satisfactory joint           policy can be arranged between them and Great Britain.    (ii.) We are at variance with the Turks  because we have taken  the  lead  against           them and put ourselves forward as the principal anti-Turkish great Power.    (hi.) Mischief has been made between us  and the Arabs by the French treatment           of the Arabs.    (iv.) Finally, the return of Constantine to Greece has severed  the special relations           which we had with that country under Monsieur Venizelos.    Our own military forces are extremely weak, and maintained  with great difficulty and expense; and  we  have not  secured  a single friend among the local Powers.It  is needless to  say  that France  and  still more   Italy have not hesitated torepresent themselves as anxious to mitigate the lot of the Turk  and to  representus  as  the  sole  obstacle.  It is  hardly possible  to  imagine a  more disappointingconclusion to our foreign policy  in  these  regions.  The only way in  which  we  canexert influence  in the  Middle  East and safeguard our enormous and varied intereststhere, is by dividing up the local Powers so that if we have some opponents, we havealso at  any rate  some  friends.   This  is  what we have always  done in the whole ofour past history.   When Russia was our enemy, Turkey was our friend, when  Turkey was our enemy, Russia was our friend.   We have been accustomed to utilize to  the full the division between the Arab and the Turk.  When everything  else had been let go,we  had at least the Greeks.  Now we are out of joint  with the whole lot at once.    I hope, therefore, that  without delay we shall endeavour to choose  from these four local Powers some whose interests we shall favour and  others for whom we cannot do so much.   It is perfectly  clear that to go on as we are, embroiled with or estrangedfrom all four local Powers, will soon reduce us to a very weak position  which we haveno adequate military power to restore.    The question  now  arises,  which  of these four  local Powers  should  we makefriends  with ?  It will be  found  very difficult  to  have good  relations  with  theGreece  of King  Constantine, and certainly it  would, be  very wrong  to  embroilourselves with the  Mohammedan  world for  the  sake of securing an  Empire  forKing Constantine  and his German   entourage.   I am. sure it will be  found    (B20/608)  50 12/20 H&amp;S, Ltd.  8808woThis document is the property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.
impossible,  however  much  it  may  be  tried,  to  have   intimate  and specialrelations  between   this  conservative  and  monarchical   country and  the SovietCommunist Government of Russia.   The more it is tried, the more it will fail, and themore it will injure the political structure on which the present Government rests.  Thereremain, therefore, the other two great elements in the Middle East, the Turks and theArabs.  And here it is well to observe that although they have hitherto been divided,they are both Mohammedan influences, and our attitude towards them produces reactionsthroughout the whole Mohammedan world.   We are the greatest Mohammedan power in the  world.   It is our duty, more than that of any other Government, to study policies which  are in harmony with Mohammedan feeling.  It would appear, therefore, that weshould initiate and pursue steaddy and consistently a  policy of friendship with turkey and with the Arabs,  and that we should not hope for any effective assistance either fromthe Bolshevik Russians or the pro-German Greeks.     Neither can these decisions be long delayed.  I dissent altogether from the policy proposed  at the  recent conference that we should allow the Greek position in Smyrnato  collapse, so  that we  have no responsibility for what happens, and then bow to theaccomplished fact.   Such  a course, whether wise  or  unwise, is not practicable.   Wecannot  maintain  our position at Constantinople if the Greek division is  withdrawnbefore  we have made good arrangements with the Turks, unless indeed we are preparedto  send large  reinforcements.   These are not  available.  We have  already cut offthe  Greek supplies  of  money,  and  their obvious reply to this will be to say that theymust do their best and dsvote such efforts as they  can make themselves to  upholdingtheir interests at  Smyrna.   The collapse or  withdrawal of the Greek division coveringConstantinople would destroy a  great part of our bargaining power  with the Turk.  Hisstrength would be greatly increased, and our position dangerously laid open. Similarly, to let the Greeks collapse at Smyrna will leave us confronted with a Turkish triumph, arid theTurks will have got  back  Smyrna  by their own efforts instead of as  the result of abargain with us which might  well safeguard Greek Christians there as  well as our owngeneral interests in  the Middle East.  If we are to make a satisfactory peace with turkey, surely we should do it  before the  Greek armies in the field  have crumbledaway or been withdrawn.   We  are already  immensely weaker than we  were, and  if weallow the  present situation to drift on for a few more weeks or months we  shall find ourselves in a position where we have no friends, where we dislike everyone, and areourselves extremely weak.  In addition we  may either have to evacuate Constantinopleor send a  considerable army to reinforce  it.   I do  not know where this army can befound.                                                                      w. s.  c.THE WAR OFFICE,       16th December, 1920.
