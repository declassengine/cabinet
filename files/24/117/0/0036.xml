   ,$iSm ty^fetary of State to Viceroy,. Foreign Department, \9jlli December 1920.              line.           Your telegram  oi 12th December, 1420 S.  Afghanistan.  I agree  that       fould  be informed of obligation to publish agreement.  But your three other points are more difficult.  I am most reluctant to sanction further concessions to Amirbefore we know what attitude he is going to take up at forthcoming discussions, and what are prospects of concluding treaty on really satisfactory lines.  To take questionof Torkham first, I should be prepared to agree to proposed small rectification&apos;as  partof a  general  settlement culminating in satisfactory treaty of  friendship.   But I amagainst making this or other concessions  without adequate quid pro quo.  Dobbs  mayuse his judgment in determining at wdiat stage of  negotiations point can bo raised with maximum effect, but he should bear in mind that it is to be used  for bargainingpurposes and  not to be finally conceded except as part of  a general settlement.   Inany case rectification must  not be regarded by Afghans as starting point for  similardemands in respect of other sections of frontier.     Similar considerations  seem to  me  to apply  to  question  of  Afghan  envoy inLondon.    If Your  Excellency  considers that this  claim cannot be resisted I shouldbe prepared  to sanction it, though with reluctance, as part of  a satisfactory treaty.But  Dobbs should not take initiative in raising question, and, if pressed by Amir, heshould endeavour to make as much capital as possible out of concession.   , Any arrangement  made should  of  course  be on  reciprocal basis, and  should recognise our right to  maintain British envoy  at  Kabul  even though&apos; we may notnecessarily wish to exercise  that right.  I assume that you  have fully considered Avhatpractical consequences  of proposed  concession are likely to be.  It may be taken ascertain that Afghan  envoy in London will not be content  to  deal with India Officebut will insist on personal access to Secretary of State  for  Foreign Affairs, like other foreign representatives.  Apart from  inconvenience and duplication of work this maywell prove to be first step in direction of  ultimate transfer to Foreign Office of conductof Afghan affairs.   It  may perhaps be  arguable that such transfer  is only logicaloutcome  of recognition of Afghan independence  in external affairs, and, if so, YourExcellency may regard  contingency as inevitable, and may  be prepared, eventually, to acquiesce in it.  But at least we ought to be under no illusion as to direction in whichwe may be moving.     There remains question of title His  Majesty.   Your Excellency is well aware ofobjections  entertained in this country to  grant of title.   I informed you in my telegramof 4th May last that I  could not lay proposition before  His  Majesty &quot;&quot;the King  untilAmir had  given some  real proof of changed disposition.  I  regret  that I can seenothing  in present  circumstances to justify me in modifying that attitude.&apos;  YourExcellency speaks of grave  embarrassment to Mission if use of title is not permitted.;but I find  it difficult to believe that we shall forgo any real advantage  by maintainingattitude  of reserve towards Amir until he has shown unmistakably that his intentionsare genuinely friendly.   So far we have no real evidence of this.   It seems to me thatAmir is  less  and not more likely to  prove amenable  if we  show ourselves undulycomplaisant from the  start.  I  consider that title should be  held  in  reserve to bebestowed as a reward for a  satisfactory  treaty, conclusion  of which, would  be fittingopportunity for His  Majesty the King to adopt this means of  marking  his recognitionof Amir&apos;s membership of brotherhood of sovereigns,     I am submitting recommendation to  the King accordingly, and will inform youas soon as  I have received Flis Majesty&apos;s. commands.  Dobbs may then, if he thinks itdesirable, let it be known unofficially to Amir that in event of conclusion of satisfactorytreaty he will be accorded  style His  Majesty both in treaty itself and thereafter onall occasions by His Majesty&apos;s Government.     I am telegraphing  separately  regarding  commercial   clauses  of  proposed agreement.  Point  raised  in  my  telegram,  viz., control  of supply of  arms  to afghanistan might be considered in connection with  question  of  quid pro quo forproposed concessions.     Finally, I would ask Your Excellency  to realise unfortunate impression likely tobe produced here by series of concessions to Afghanistan, without anything that publicopinion  will  regard as really  commensurate return.   Do you  think it possible ifdiscussions proceed favourably  that Amir  could  be brought to a point at which hewould voluntarily seek to place  himself under our advice in  regard to conduct of hisforeign relations ?   I throw this out as a suggestion only,  but it is one that I should wish Dobbs to bear in mind during negotiations.
