No. 224.    .       further indecisive  fighting has occurred  between Dirwals  and Swatis,  and   Lashkars now reported dispersing.       2.  Black Mountain  tribes have now complied  with terms in  full.  Blockade   accordingly raised, and detachment being withdrawn to Abbottabad.       3.  Eleven rifles handed in by Afridis during week.  Full  jirga expected shortly   to discuss provision of labour for Khaibar Railway.       4.  Wana Wazirs  handed in 4 Government rifles, 13  tribal rifles, and  further   instalment of fine, on 12th December.  Party of  Wazirs, with  30 Government rifles,   have crossed Tochi to Khost.       5.  Reports  from Kabul  suggest that, although Amir- has given out he has no   intention of adopting title (of Khalifa ?), plainly he would  personally like to do so,   and is allowing Kabul Mullahs to do so (as a ?) test of public opinion on subject.       6.  Some members of Jemal Pasha mission have  arrived at Kandahar, probably   en route to Herat.  Jemal himself was in Kabul up to 3rd December.       7.  Abdul Aziz, the Amir&apos;s personal assistant, has announced in&apos; Kandahar  that   he  has orders  to  enlist  seven new battalions from Duraui tribes.   As far as  our   information goes at present this is due to sanction to reorganisation  of army on tribal   basis, rather than to increase in standing army.  He is also enlisting special body-   guard of Duranis for the  Amir.   Considerable opposition to  furnishing recruits being   shown by Duranis, especially the Sardars.       8.  A temporary  Bolshevik Consul for Maimana has left Herat. Ill-feeling between   Governor and  Yulosov, Bolshevik Consul at Herat, increased  by further Jamshedi   raids.       9.  Waziristan.  No  change Wana column.   Peace  party among Wazirs appears   unable to enforce adhesion of hostile sections to settlement, and advance to Wana will   probably commence  16th.       Paras. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 not given to Press.
