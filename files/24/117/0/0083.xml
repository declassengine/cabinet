REDUCTION  fig  BRITISH  GABBISOH  IN  MESOPOTAMIA.(Not paraphrased)*From :** G.O.C.-in-Q.Mesopotamia.To      War Office.X. 767 cipher November 28th.   Pirst of 8 parts.In putting forward my views regarding question of reductions of British garrison in Mesopotamia I have hitherto laid stress only on internal factors affecting the numbersrequisite S- (1) Now to stamp out insurrection, establishArab Government authority and effect disarmamont andsubsequently, to maintain internal peaoe when established? later, figure is. largely dependent on the efficacy of disarmament policy in practice and on progress information of intended Arab Army and auxiliary force both ofwhich no loss than the reception by tho country of thoprovisional Arab Government and no doubt permanentsuccessor, must remain uncertain quantities for somo timeto come*(2).   ?

X, 767 cipher IJovombor 27th.Trend ox Greek policy in ksiu Minor resulting from roc ontelections may change,  and cessation of further Greekoffensive action in Allied interests would relieve pressure on Nationalists and permit of their consolidation and theresuscitation of active designs for recovery at least ofportion of territories which wero integral provinces of pre-war Turkey.3c   Turco-Bolshevik alliance is unnatural and should bosusceptible of disruption by skilful policy and propaganda^At the same time enmity against Great Britain and Francecommon to Bolshevists and Nationalists,  is at sufficient strength to (?) give alliance certain (group undec,) life.It therefore contains potentialities inimical to Persia,Mesopotamia and Syria which demand precautions.4r,   Trend of Nationalist policy on northern border ofMesopotamia is already evidenced by persistent report ofaggressive intentions against Mosul Yillayot,
 X.  767 ciphor Kovomeor  27 th. These are  supported by  documents of commission to incite&apos;anti-British activities of outlawed loaders in Telafar (?af), frcm  Turkish official military  quarters,  (?) reported (?) conspiracies  and revelation of embryo plan for tribal raids into Mesopotamia  territory with small nucleus of regular  troops  and artillery.   Recent changes in senior military commanders and  civil officials  in Jeziroh group area also show  distinct anti-British colour,   Effectives of units of Jozirsh  group are still little  more than sufficient to maintain order  in the area in their occupation;- their numbers havo  however-.increased  appreciably and intensive recruiting campaign is in  progress which if backed by Bolshevik money would doubtless meet with some  measure of success. Raiding  warfare under trained direction would be effective and diffioult  to cope with  on the Baghdad Mosul L. of 0.  and on lines connecting the Mosul with advanced posts, while only money organisation and a handful of troops aro required to stir up  Kurdish tribes  (?) along (group undeo.) north eastern border to  unrest, liable to assume grave proportions.
PART r.Y,X 767 cipher 27/11.French disappointment regarding Mosul; their ix)sitionon the flank in Cilicia and Syria and their activeattempt to attract Assyrian and other Christians ofMosul Villayet to their area and protection,leads to thesupposition in this matter they may seek to protect their own interests without regard to ours.      If diplomacy can secure effective French co-operationmy task and responsibilities would be appreciablylightened.6-,    Conflicting territorial ambitions in  North WestPersia will tend to embroil Turco Bolshevik relations butboth  are likely to-initiate enterprises in  PersianAzerbaijan detrimental t- interests and integrity of persia while one of Bolshevik main objectives  will berevolution in  Capital,      Though they will be handicapped by lack  of railwaysand by road transport difficulties, possession of Seabases and availability  of requisite  troops vehiclesend fuel will  give them  power  (?) to  concentrate con-siderable numbers  and :advance  at  short notice *
X.768 cipher November 27th.  .This pc&amp;tr (?) will be increased when ice of NorthernCaspian breaks up in May,, and no force that we can maintain in Horth West Persia can hope to withstandserious military advance on Kasvin and Teheran shouldtheir plan take form.  Bolshevik control of Baku - Alex-andropol - Tabriz railway and branch toaSherifkhanaprovides double threat of alternative line of advance onKasvin and of movement via Urnd (?a) and Rowanduz fjjrMesopotamia.7.    Severe winter in Anatolia, Transcaucasia and 11 Ji*Persia will defer any hostile operations on large scalefcit4 spring 1921 when possibility of combined action&amp;t IM* Persia and on northern border of Mesopotamianwtrrt be kept in view.  It is (?) also at this timeand not before, after harvest of winter crops, thatit will appear whe4f ker or not Arab tribal unrest willbr^eak out, and at least minor outbreaks must be expected.      May to July 1921 therefore may be a period ofcrisis involving (?) heavy call on (?) troops for northern Meso^K?tamia front and lines of communicationthereto *
                PART  VI,X.767 cipher November 27th.This may synchronize with hostile activities in NorthernPersia on considerable scale necessitating withdrawal of      iNsrperforce if not already Withdrawn.   In any case spread of anarchy in Persia would, reaot on tribos in Mesopotamiaa no! would demand military  measures to  prevent its penetrationin form of organised foroosS  Even if  French prevent  troublefrom Turkey and Syria (grout undee.) reaching us via  UpperEuphrates result of events in Persia and  propaganda must inevitably stimulate (?)  internal unrost  in Mesopotamia  ata season fertile for its  growth.     I therefore ask for  clear statement  of policy to which my troops are- to give, effect both in Mesopotamia and  perhapsPersia and urge in strong terms, if I  am to bo responsiblefor defence of present Eesopotamian frontiers against external,aggression as well as maintain internal ?peaco,  thatprecipitous reductions in  strength of  British garrison priorto July 1921 would be premature and unwise.  I request thatthese views may be borne  in mind when  considering questionof reduction of Force under my command.
X. 76 7 cipher November 28th.9. LB only river communication exists at present betweenBasrah and l ut-el-iimara and tho reconstruct ion of tho BasrahBaghdad railway line has not boon decided upten by theArab ?Government and it may be necessary to maintain ? troopsadi titnal t o present numbers north ol Baghdad, or tiers fravobeen issued suspend ins; the repatriation  of all &apos;I..v/.T.personnel to India and the declaration of all essentialcraft as deliverable to the Commissioner of Disposals Board.     We hold at present a surplus of both personnel  and Craftthat have been used for operations connected&apos; with recentinsurrection.  Their retention is costly but if personnelaro repatriated sod craft sold overseas their collection afreshwill entail long delays.PART  VII.
                    PART  VIII,X.767 cipher November 27th,10.   Should situation approximate that outlined, above,  it wouldbe advisable to meet aggression -from the people by advanoe tosome distance beyond Mosul, engaging hostile columns ? ifpossible in detail.  Suoh action would diminish likelihood oftribes rising in opposition to us.     Mosul is 75 miles from present mailhoad at Shergat   and proposed advance, which would add considerably ti length of road communications, ? would reduce amount of transportavailable and affect mobility of our forces.   To extendBaghdad-Kifri line would entail long delay,  while oxtensionof present Baghdad-Shergat (? group omitted) to Mosul or atleast to Qalyara, whence good, road commerces would therefore benecessary.     For this ? material would be required.2t  Whitehall. Gardens^  S.W.1st Booftsbor, 1920.
