secret this Document h the Property.ofHis BV.tann.ic \-   ;159&apos; unent.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,              mil December 1920.0985                             (Received  loth, .10 aim;)     (Tear the line.     1.420 S.   Now that it has been decided to send Mission to Kabul, there are various matters requiring urgent consideration.     Firstly. Question of recognition of Amir&apos;s title of His Majesty.   In our telegramNo. 1201 S., dated loth October 1920, we draw your attention to  vital importance ofthis point.   Our Mission will be hopelessly handicapped if they are not  authorised to address Amir by title which  he has  assumed, and  it is  more than  likely that thewhole negotiations may break down upon this petty matter, in which  Amir&apos;s amourpro pre is obviously involved.   Moreover, if  negotiations reach pitch  at which Amiris ready to sign treaty to our liking, it is inconceivable that he would do  so  withoutuse in it of title which  he claims.   We feel sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government will seek to remove this grave embarrassment, which would  weaken  position  of  mission from the start, and we trust we may receive very early orders permitting  recognitionof title in question.    Secondly. Publication  of any agreement  which may be signed with Amir.  Itseems clear that under Article No.  18 of  League of Nations  Covenant, we shall  be bound to publish agreement, and.it seems necessary  to inform Amir of this obligationat outset.  Do you agree ?  This may incidentally strengthen our  hand in  demandingdetails of Amir&apos;s agreement with Bolsheviks.    Thirdly. Question of Afghan representative in  London.   Under para. No. 6 B.of Mussoorie Aide-Memoire point was  specifically reserved for further discussion, atthe time of negotiating a treaty of friendship.   It was brought forward by  the AfghanDelegates at Mussoorie, and pressed by them with considerable persistence, and it isclear that they attach much importance to it as a test, of British sincerity, in giving to afghanistan  independent status   in foreign affairs.  After renewed and  anxiousconsideration,  we are of opinion that  the  claim of Afghanistan  to representation inLondon cannot longer be logically  withstood.  Afghanistan may rightly expect&apos;equality in this matter  with  such  States  as Persia  and Siam, which  are much lesspowerful than she.  Our release from control of her  foreign relations clearly gave herstatus of all other independent nations,  and to refuse her request can only fill  her withsuspicion of our real  intentions.  We fully realise the  embarrassment which  may  be caused, both, to His  Majesty&apos;s Government  and to  Government  of India by change which we now advocate.  Tendency of Afghans will  be possibly to try to play off HisMajestyV Government against  Government  of India,  and  there  may be  otherinconveniences, but these must, we fear, be faced.    Fourthly. Question  of  rectification  of  the   frontier  at Torkham.   This isexplained in note enclosed by Foreign Secretary to Political Secretary in secret  demi-official letter 259 F.,  dated 14th October 1920, and we should  be  glad to  be  able toauthorise  Dobbs  to  make capital out of   suggested concession, if  (his  appearsadvantageous,  and would help negotiations.
