This document is the  property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.CP. 2334                  73THE  CABINET.EGYPTIAN  COTTON CONTROL  SCHEME.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR WAR.    I circulate herewith a memorandum prepared in the War Office with regard tothe proposal contained in Lord Curzon&apos;s Memorandum of 1st Decemher (CP. 2221)to allocate one-half  of  His Majesty&apos;s Governments share of the  surplus CottonControl funds to the Egyptian Government for the relief of disabled members  of theEgyptian Labour Corps and the dependants of those who lost their lives.                                                                   W. S. C.  THE WAE  OFFICE,       21st December, 1920.     With  reference  to paragraph  6 of Cabinet Paper  2221,  the  present  scale of compensation for disability or  death  for members of the Egyptian Labour Corps  and their dependants  gives gratuities not  exceeding one  year&apos;s  pay of the  injured (or deceased) man.   This scale is similar to that applicable to  several enrolled native corps (including the Greek and Malta  Labour Corps), and is that which was contracted for on enrolment.   There is no obligation on the War Office to increase the awards already made, and the request of Lord Allenby is based on political considerations.     The application of the Egyptian Pension Laws as proposed by Lord Allenby would result (according  to his estimate)  in an  immediate  charge  of about 100,000/.  for increased gratuities, and an annual charge of 50,000/. a year.   If the total charge for pensions is taken at 10 years&apos; purchase of the annual charge, the total liability  involved in the proposal is about  600,000/. ; but the War Office  at present  has no means of checking Lord Allenby&apos;s figures.     No case has been made out  for adding so considerable a charge to Army Estimates, but  if refusal  of the proposal  is likely to prejudice the Government in settling the allocation of the Surplus Cotton  Control Funds, no objection is offered to the suggestion that the Egyptian Government  be left  to  carry out their proposal  at the expense of-Egyptian funds, a corresponding allowance being made from the portion of the Surplus Cotton Control Funds retained by His Majesty&apos;s Government as their share.(B20/518) 100  12/20 H&amp;S, Ltd.  8819wo
