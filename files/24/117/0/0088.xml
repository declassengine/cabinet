GRANTS IN AID OF UNIVERSITY EDUCATION

Memorandum by  the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

1. I desire to submit for the consideration of my colleagues the question of the provision  to be made next year for grants in aid of University education.

2. Before the War, State grants to Universities and Colleges amounted to £468,500 annually. For the year 1919-20 this sum was increased to £1,000,000, and a further non-re?urrent sum of £500,000 was provided for the  purpose of special emergency grants to enable the Universities to overcome their immediate difficulties and  resume their work after the lesses of the War. At the same time a Committee (the University Grants Committee)was appointed, with Sir William M&apos;Cormick as Chairman, to enquire into the whole question of the financial needs of University institutions and to advise the Treasury as to the application of any grants that might be made towards meeting these needs.

3. This Committee paid  visits to all institutions on the grant list and in May 1920 submitted a memorandum.  This memorandum showed conclusively that substantially increased revenues were essential to enable the Universities to maintain their promises, etc and pay their staffs, without making any allowance for the      many developments and expansions demanded in the national interest.

4. In view of the state of affairs disclosed by this memorandum, and emphasised by an influential deputation which I received representative of all forms of University institutions throughout the country, I addressed  a letter dated 16th July, 1920, to the University Grants Committee In which I stated that I would be      prepared, subject to the  over-riding necessities of national finance, to submit to Parliament an estimate increasing the sum  for recurrent grants from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000 for the year
 5.    on n of my objects in making this  intimation wag  to stimulate local endoaveur by the proapOot  of proportionate Treasury granto allocated primarily in relation to now local support.    In addition&apos;to the  appeals now hoing made, practically all  tho  institutions  are at my  instigation raising their fees hy from  25$ to 50$.    Despite &apos;howover  tho  prospootivo increase of revenue from foes  and appeals for local support. I was eat- isfiod that tho rooourooo of the Universities would otill bo quite inadequate without tho furthor State aid which I. provision- ally  promised. 6,    In  my letter to  tho University Grants Oommittoe I also stated that  I was prepared to consider  the advisability of proposing to Parliament  a non-reourrent sum of  500,000 to assist the Univoroitioc In mooting the grievance  of those of their senior members  who are precluded from  profiting to tho full by the benefits  of tho Universities Federated Superannuation Schomo. the Toaohers Superannuation Act,  of 1918,  definitely oxoludos teachers  in University instItutions, and for reasons which It Is not neoossary to elaborate It  io  highly desirable that theAct should  not  be extended  to the staffs of Universities.   On the other hand,  the older University teachers are under a seriousdisability  owing to the  fact that tho Federated SuperannuationScheme was  only instituted  in 1913  se that their oarlior servicecannot bo takon into  account unless  special provision is made.7.   The grant  In aid  of University  education is almost tho  onlycase which  exhibits tho Treasury as  a spending Department*Until the last  year or  two  the grants have been very meagre  andtha Universities now  stand  in groat need.
                                                       -    412                                                            I - .     I oubrait that the promised grant of  1,500,000 for  general purposes should stand.    It will be used to encouraga Universitiesto raise money for themselves and thus nervn as some insuranooagainst still larger demands.     I am proparod to reduce in amount or to withdraw ontirelytho eonditional promise of an additional  500,000 for super-annuation if the Cabinet thinks it desirable to make an  example of economy in my porson.(Intd)    A.C-Treasury  S.W.I.December 29th,  1920.
