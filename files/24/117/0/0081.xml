TIMS  IM Ml ThT,i(YAr?n^23 Bt1w&apos;^Memorandum for tb&amp;  Cabinet by the  Civil Lord%]t             of the  Admiralty,        With reference to Cabinet 77 (20)  (5)  directing the -Admiralty to prepare a report for cons:deration by the cabinet this woek on the steps proposed to bo taken to carry out the instruction that short-time should be introduced in Dockyards andIndustrial Establishments, the following outline scheme nas beenprepared,  Tins scheme is considered by the Admiralty to be  the mostfeasible way cf carrying out the policy of tho Cabinet,                    Arrangement of, hpurs,,        Subject to any change of detail in the arrangements  it  isproposed that as from Monday, the 10th January, the working day for industrial staffs in the Dockyards and o trier industrial establishments shall begin at 8 a8nu instead of 7 a*m. and thatSaturdays shall bo closed days.The woridng week for industrial staffs will therefore be reduced from 47 hours to 37 hours, and there will be a proportionatereduction, i.e., a reduction of between 21 per cent and 22 per  centin the.,&quot;wages of the employees affected.,  .            Application of.-Short-time.(1)  Short-time will be apolied to all industrial staffs including^^w^---.^                   wv given the option of being&apos;dischargedon abolition of office with such pension as the  Treasury may awardunder the Superannuation Act 1359.(2)rbecThe  (i) Differentiation wculd increase the unpopularity of the      scheme, (ii) Tho running of machinery on Saturdays for repayment work      only would be uneconomical unless it ma certain that the      increase in output would be considerable:-(iii) The general temporarily cf the men and the presumption that      the working of lull time will only conunue as long as      the repayment work lasts would prevent the working of      full time on such work from having any material effecton output.The delay as regards (a)  will involve extra cost  to  the  Government,estimated at about  80,000.  in the hire M Tankers,  and  the  delayas regards (b) and (c) will  involve the payment of penalties forlate delivery M the Tankers and a continuance of payment oi hirefor the merchant vessels, say,  11,500 in all.  There  are alsoindications,..
-indications  that  the workmen will regard the introduction of short- time as an infringement of  the Colwyn agreement, and will decline to continue  doing any work  on a &quot;payment hy results&quot; basis. The effect of this will oe a greatly increased&apos;cost of such work,  which cannot at present bo estimated.        The  sewing for the  period of 12 weeks from 10th January to 2nd April, due to the reduction in wages earned by existing employees and without allowing for the extra expenditure mentioned in&apos;the paragraphs immediately preceding, or for the cost of absorbing additional labour now unemployed in the localities, is estimated at roughly  567,000.         AbsoxglLon of labour now MPjaplojoi IiU^J^alilies.        Until certain local enquiries-have been completed,  it is impossible to givre full details on this point. It may, however be stated at once that it will not be practicable to absorb additional labour to an extent that will balance the reduction in wages and output due to the introduction of short-time *         Ship donstruetion, refitting and repair work.        In work of this nature which constitutes the bulk of the dockyard employment, the total number of men that can be employed on a given ioK not  merely so  as to give the best economical result, but so as not actually to Hamper the work, kit is limited by practical considerations such as spaqo. the output of which machinery is capaole, etcc, The number oX-Jobs that can be taken in hand at one time is largely dependent on our limited number of Docks, and the number of unskilled man  that can be employed is dependent on the number of skilled fainatl tradesmen employed a The ratio of ski Hod to unskilled men employed on repair and  refitting work is about four to one If skilled tradesmen in the right proportions wore available for absorption,  it.would be possible to aosorb about .1,900 additional men, it is;beji..Sved? however., that the necessary stilled men are not available in the  localities, and it seems undesirable, owing to housing difficulties and other reasons, to attract skilled men from other districts or industries such as Wilding,         It  is proposed, however, to proceed with  the scheme that was before the Cabinet on the 6th December, and to absorb 2,000 men on scraping and painting ships,- work performed before the war by Naval ratings, Pl^eiJLmlin^april^&amp;:  pejieriil.^more.jiork (Dockyards Armament Supply Depots, &quot;Victualling Yards);        It is estimated that, roughly, 1.400 -men can be absorbed, including 70 to 80 men already employed but about  to be discharged, Building and Engineering Work:     It is considered that about 1,000 men can be absented, bir, this estimate necessarily a  tentative one  - as the possibility of taking on more men far building work is mainly dependent on the  number of  skilled tradesmen, e.g.-, Bricklayers, that may bo  available * DxMpfig:    The number of men that can be employed in a dredger, is limited by tho space and by tho duties porfornod,  and cannot be increased1, After&apos;careful consideration,&apos; it is not  though possible to absorb any additional men on this class of work without increasing the number of shifts, which would be very expensive and would use up sums which can bo expended  to more advantage in reducing unemploy- men t in other directions.So
        So far,  therefore,  as can ho  seen  at  present,  a  total  of5,400 men now unemployed in tho localities can  be  absorbed, at a cost of 1218.500,  as against  567,000 saved on  the wages ofexisting employees,        Owinx to the impossibility of entering additional labour to make up,for the short-time on ship construction,  repair,and refitting work and.on building work,  there will  be&quot;a serious loss of uutput in those directions. The effect on  the  Oilersunder construction has already been referred to. As  regards  refitsand repairs, it is obvious that tho period for which each shin tajeninhand will occupy a dock will be increased by 20  per  cent,  and thatthis must delay the whole programme of refits. The seasonal  refitsof the active Fleet, however, have recently been completod for1920-21, that that the effect on the efficiency of the Fleetwill not be serious, providod that the system of short-time  is notprolonged beyond April next. Should it be proposed to  prolong itbeyond this date, the Board of Admiralty will have to  considerthe question further from the point of view of their responsibilityfor the efficiency of the active Fleet,        A mooting of the Admiralty Industrial Council  was heldon December 29th at which tho Minister of Labour was present and explained tho whole unemployment situation at length.  The schemewas eventually accepted by the Trade Union side as a cabinet decision, though with considerable demur, A further  meeting willbe held on Decembor 30th to discuss minor details  as to putting the scheme  into force with the least inconvenience to  the employees.QoneraL^emarte.(sgd)  ONSLOW,29. 12. 20,
