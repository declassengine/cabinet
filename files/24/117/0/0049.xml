                       WORK OF THE MISSION IN EGYPT.    THE despatch of a Special Mission to Egypt had been under the considerationof His Majesty&apos;s Government since April  1919, when  the prevailing unrest in thatcountry had culminated in manifestations of violence and disorder; and in May theannouncement was made that such a Mission, under the chairmanship of Lord Milner,would proceed thither in the autumn.  The openly-avowed intention of the EgyptianNationalists to organise a boycott of the Mission received great encouragement fromthe protest of Mohammed Said Pasha, the Prime Minister, against its arrival beforethe peace with Turkey had  been signed, and was intensified after his resignation,which followed the overruling of his protest.  Mohammed Said Pasha was succeededas Prime Minister by Wahba Pasha, and the new Ministry was in office during thewhole of our stay in Egypt.    Wahba  Pasha  himself  has   since  resigned,  owing  to  ill-health,  aridhis place  has  been  taken  by Tewfik Nessim Pasha,  one  of his  colleagues,who,  during   our  stay  in   Egypt,  was   Minister   of   the  Interior.    the courage  and  patriotism of these  two Prime Ministers  and of  their colleagues in taking  office  at  a time when  their country was passing  through so gravea  crisis, and  when their own lives  were  daily  in danger,  cannot be  too  highlycommended.  Tewfik Nessim Pasha&apos;s Ministry, which is still in office, consists, with one exception, of the same men as Wahba Pasha&apos;s and is of the same character.  Itis  a Ministry of  affairs, composed of capable administrators, loyal to the Sultan aridworking harmoniously with the British High Commissioner,  but of  no distinctpolitical colour and indisposed to take any decided line with regard to the burningquestion of the future of Egypt.  ,    The change  of Ministry in Egypt, and other circumstances, caused the departure of the Mission to be delayed until the end of November.  We arrived at Port Said onthe morning of Sunday, the 7th December, and in  Cairo on the afternoon of the same day.  In view of the general attitude of hostility to  the Mission, which had beensedulously fostered, every precaution was taken for our security, and we reached the hotel  where quarters had been prepared for our reception without incident.  Theday after our  arrival we were all presented by Lord Allenby to His Highness the sultan,  a formal visit, which had  been preceded by  a  short audience  of a moreintimate kind which he had accorded to Lord Milner.  This was the first of a numberof conversations  which, during our stay in Egypt, our  Chairman and other membersof the Mission had with His Highness, who always treated us with great friendliness.In these conversations he expressed himself freely about the political situation inEgypt, the events of the last few years, and the difficulties of his own position.  Buthe carefully abstained from giving any advice with  regard  to the subject  of  our reference, viz., the future constitution of Egypt.   Beyond warning us to be slow informing conclusions and on our guard against busybodies, and  indicating certainmen of  position whom it would be  well for us to consult such as Ruslidi  Pasha,Adli Pasha, Mohammed Said Pasha and Mazlum Pasha, all of them ex-Ministers he never attempted in any way to guide or influence our deliberations. His attitude,as far as the main object of the Mission was concerned, was one of studied reserve.    This reserve was even more marked in the case of the Ministers, Wahba Pasliaand his  colleagues, to whom we were introduced at a party given by Lord Allenby atthe Residency on the 11th December, and with whom throughout our stay in Egyptwe maintained very cordial relations.  They were at all times ready to assist us inour enquiries,  to put every sort of information at our disposal, and to bring us into touch  with any officials whom we desired to see.  There was never any doubt of their willingness to give us every opportunity of becoming acquainted with the mechanismof government or the state of the country.  But they were particularly careful to leave us to form our  own conclusions.   Though freely invited to do so, they were not disposed to make any suggestions of  their own on constitutional, as distinct frompurely administrative  questions,  and never evinced  any desire  to know in whatdirection the thoughts of the Mission were tending with regard to the future goverh-ment  of Egypt.    In  strong contrast with the caution and reserve exhibited by the native  officialworld  was the storm of  protest and disapprobation with which the arrival of theMission was greeted by the  native public and  the native press.   We had not beenmany  days, or even hours, in Cairo before we had ample evidence of  active and      359  [4941]                                                   B 2
organised antagonism.  Telegrams poured in announcing the intention of the sendersto go on strike as a protest against our presence.  Many of these were despatched byschoolboys  and students, but others came from public  bodies, such as ProvincialCouncils, a lew from Government officials, and a considerable number from corpora-tions or communities of greater or less importance.  We received in all 1,131 suchmessages during our stay, while  only  twenty-nine telegrams of welcome  were received, mostly from private persons  acquainted  with  individual members of theMission.   The Egyptian  vernacular press, with  rare  exceptions, exhausted therepertory of  vituperation  and inuendo,  proclaiming that any recognition  of theMission Would be interpreted as  an acceptance of the existing situation and thatany  Egyptian who had dealings with its members would be guilty of treason to his country.    The  majority  of writers consistently maintained that  Zaghlul Pashaat Paris was the accredited representative of the Egyptian people,  and the mission was  recommended to address itself to him.   A series of  short strikes were declared by students, lawyers, tramwaymen,  cab drivers and shopkeepers, and processions ofstrikers,  reinforced by numbers of schoolboys and the rougher elements of the city,paraded  the  streets with banners,  denouncing the  Mission and Lord Milner  inparticular, and  acclaiming  Zaghlul Pasha  and  the  &quot; Complete independence of Egypt.&quot;   Nor  were such  demonstrations confined to the male  population.The  Cairene  ladies  availed themselves  of  this  occasion  to  abandon   theirseclusion  and  to   drive  through  the  streets  with  similar war cries.    Thisprocession, however unwonted, was orderly enough, but the schoolboys and hooliganswere frankly riotous, and  but for  the admirable order maintained by the  policewith occasional military support  there would have been considerable destruction ofproperty and even bloodshed.  As it was, beyond the wrecking of  a few tramcars,little damage to property actually  resulted.  And after the first week or two disorder in Cairo gradually subsided, though throughout  our stay occasional attacks uponBritish soldiers and three  successive attempts  to  assassinate  members  of  theMinistry showed that the criminal element was still active, especially among a sectionof the student class.     It seems needless to dwell at greater length upon the many manifestations of hostility to the Mission and its object.  Mention should,  however, be made of two of(them, which  as indicative of the strength of the popular current appeared to be ofspecial importance.   In the second week after our arrival the heads of the El AzharUniversity, the  centre of Mahommedan  religious  teaching,  addressed  a manifestoto the High Commissioner,  which  set forth the claims of  Egypt to complete indepen-dence and  demanded the  withdrawal of the British.   There was  some reason tobelieve that the religious  leaders  who  actually  signed this  document  were notparticularly enamoured of the political course on which  they thus found themselvesembarked,  but yielded to the pressure of the  teachers and  students, among  whomanti-British propaganda had for some time been increasingly active.  This manifestowas  followed  a little later by  a  similar declaration, signed by  six  Princes  ofthe family of Mohammed Ali, near relatives of the Sultan, which was contained ina letter to  Lord Milner and simultaneously published in the press.   The action ofthe Princes may have been prompted by various motives, but the dominant one was undoubtedly  their  desire  to gain  popularity  by identifying themselves  with  a movement which at the moment was sweeping like a tidal wave over the country.     The immediate object of the promoters of this movement was to prevent themembers of  the  Mission  from  coming  into  friendly  touch with representativeEgyptians and thus ascertaining for themselves how much  substance there  was inthe demand for &quot; complete independence,&quot; and in the  ceaseless denunciations of &quot;the protectorate.&quot; With this end in view the headquarters of the Mission were constantlywatched by unostentatious pickets.  The  visit of any Egyptian of note was  at oncecommunicated to the press  and became  the subject of minatory comment.  Moreover,the offender was liable to be subjected to a domiciliary visit in his own house from a group  of students, demanding an  explanation of his conduct, which generally ended in his making a profuse profession of his Nationalist faith and affirming that in his conversation with the Mission he had been careful in no wise to depart from it.  Onlyin one or two cases did the person thus visited have the courage to tell the intruders tomind their own business.  Meantime, the  movements of members of the Mission werecarefully followed,  especially when any of us  went into the provinces.  Emissarieswould be immediately despatched from Cairo to dog  our footsteps,  to try to preventour  getting into touch with the local people, especially the fellanin, and to arrange.demonstrations  calculated to impress  us with  the solidarity  of Egyptian  opinion.[4841]
The visit to Tanta of one member of the Mission led to serious riots, which continued for many days and were only quelled by  the intervention of the military.   Thesedemonstrations naturally to some extent hampered our work.   But they certainlyfailed in their main object, for it was impossible not to come to the conclusion that,if the Egyptians  were really so unanimous as we were intended to think, we shouldhave been left to find that out for ourselves by going about the country without let orhindrance.    It must not be supposed that the boycott of the Mission, carried out as it mainlywas by  students  and schoolboys,  was approved by  educated  Egyptians generally,or even by all those who held advanced  Nationalist views.   Rudeness to strangersappeared to  them inconsistent with the courtesy and  hospitality upon which  allEgyptians pride themselves.  Moreover,  there were a large number of men who were really anxious to bring their views before the Mission, but  were deterred from doing so by fear of the personal annoyance to which they might in consequence be exposed.It was,  therefore, suggested to us in many quarters that,  if only we  would make itclear, that by appearing before the Mission a man did not necessarily compromise hisposition as a Nationalist, the barrier to  free converse would be removed.  We accor-dingly drew up the following declaration, which was published on the 29th Decemberin the Official Journal and the  press:          &quot; The British Mission has been  struck by  the existence of  a widespread    belief that the object of  its coming is to deprive Egypt  of rights  which it has    hitherto possessed.  There is  no foundation whatever for this  belief.   The    Mission  has been sent  out  by  the  British Government, with the  approval of    Parliament, to reconcile the aspirations  of the Egyptian people with the special    interests which  Great Britain has  in Egypt and with the maintenance of the    legitimate rights of  all foreign residents in the country.         &quot;We are convinced that with  goodwill on both sides this object is attain-    able, and it is the sincere desire of the Mission  to  see  the  relations of Great    Britain  and  Egypt established on a basis of friendly  accord which will put an    end to friction and will enable the Egyptian people to devote the whole of their    energies to the development of their country under self-governing institutions.         &quot; In pursuance of this task the  Mission desires to  hear all views, whether of    representative bodies or  individuals who have  the welfare of their country  at     heart.  All opinions may be freely expressed.  There is no wish on the part of the     Mission to restrict the area of discussion nor need any man fear to compromise    his convictions by appearing before it.  He will be  no more compromised by    expressing his opinions than the Mission will be compromised by hearing them.    Without a perfectly frank discussion it is difficult to put an end to misunder-    standing and arrive at agreement.&quot;     This declaration certainly had some effect in mitigating hostility, but it did not get over the reluctance of  Egyptians generally to enter into formal relations withthe Mission.  We therefore  made  up our minds that, as  far as Egyptian  opinion was concerned, we must  rely  upon our individual opportunities of social intercoursewith men of various classes to elicit it.  As such opportunities constantly presentedthemselves, and as the people whom we thus  met, and who  certainly included most ofthe leaders of Egyptian  opinion,  expressed their views in private with the greatestfrankness and unreserve, we succeeded  during the three months of our stay in verythoroughly gauging the main currents of thought and feeling in the Egyptian world.     While a good deal of time was spent in these conversations, we were also busilyengaged in studying the situation from an entirely  different angle.   In addition tothe carefully prepared volumes of official documents drawn up for the instruction ofthe Mission  by the Foreign Office,  a very  considerable amount of valuable evidencehad been collected before our arrival by  an Information Committee instituted by theHigh Commissioner, which had obtained, the  considered  views,  on many issues,  ofprominent officials, of unofficial residents and representative bodies.   The study andcollation  of these views, which had been ably edited by the  Secretary of the Com-mittee,  Captain B. A. Hooper, occupied some time.   They remain as an importantsource of information at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    While the perusal of this mass of documents was of the greatest assistance to us,we sought to supplement the information contained in them by getting into personaltouch with as many members of the British  community, official and unofficial, as wehad time to see, as well as with the principal foreign residents,  who, of course, hadno hesitation about coming into open and constant  contact with the  Mission.   The
evidence and advice  of  the  chief  British  officials  was  freely  available to us from the first, and we are greatly indebted to them for the ready help they gave us.With their  aid  we were  enabled not only to  gain a fairly  comprehensive view ofrecent events, but to make an  exhaustive&quot; examination  of  the organisation  and personnel of every department of the Egyptian  Government.  This work was dividedup between sub-committees, who reported to the Mission, which also assembled in full strength to  hear the views of the highest British officials, as well  as those of sir william Brunyate, the late Acting  Financial Adviser to  the Egyptian Government,who was present in Cairo during the latter part of our stay.   Meantime, the legalmember of  the Mission, Mr  (now  Sir  Cecil)  Hurst, while  co-operating as far aspossible in these activities, devoted the greater  part of bis time to enquiring into thejudicial system  and  the modifications best adapted to bring it into harmony with present requirements.   Similarly Sir Owen Thomas, besides serving on one of thesub-committees just referred  to, paid special attention to the study of agriculturalconditions,  and  visited a number  of  estates,  public  and private, to  make himselffamiliar with the methods of  cultivation and the life of the  people.  The wholeMission, with the exception of  one member who was otherwise engaged, passed theinside of a  week at Alexandria, where opportunity was afforded us of coming into contact with the important foreign communities of the great commercial centre ofEgypt.   We were there able  to hear the views of the French, Italian and Greek, aswell as of the British  Chamber of Commerce.  Many centres of activity in Upperand  Lower Egypt were also visited by individual members of the Mission, who com-municated  their  impressions to their colleagues, and, in spite of  the  endeavoursalready described to prevent our getting into direct contact with the local  population,valuable experience was thus  gained and placed on record.     Two of our number,  General  Sir John Maxwell and Sir  Owen Thomas, alsopaid a visit of several weeks to the Sudan,  and the  impressions they brought backwere a valuable supplement  to  the  information we had  already obtained from theevidence of British and native residents in that country,  whom  we had been able tosee in Cairo.     The manifold activities which we have briefly summarised kept  us all very busyduring the months of January and February.  Towards the end  of the latter month,as the  time  available for  our  enquiries in Egypt  was  drawing  to  a close,since  several   of   our  members   were  obliged   to   be  back   in  Englandbefore  the  end  of  March, we   began  to  hold  a number of  meetings  forthe   purpose   of collating   the   information  obtained  and  comparing  theviews  which  we  had  severally  formed.  It at  once became   apparent  that,in view of  the immense mass  of material and the  number  of  points requiringthorough discussion,  it would be impossible for us  to draw up a Report during theremainder of our time in  Egypt, especially as interviews still occupied  a good dealof it.  The preparation of our Report had, therefore,  necessarily to be deferred until after our return to England.   At the same  time  these  preliminary  discussionsrevealed a remarkable unanimity between us on certain cardinal points, and we evendrew up, before leaving Cairo,  though only in outline and subject to such modifica-tions as further discussion might suggest,  a series of propositions in which we were all able provisionally to agree.     These propositions ranged  over the whole field of our enquiry and have formed the  groundwork of the present Report.   It may,  therefore, be convenient  at thisstage to review the  results of  our  investigations in Egypt  and the conclusions towhich they had led us.                                      II.                 PROVISIONAL CONCLUSIONS  ARRIVED AT  IN EGYPT.            (A.) Causes  of  the Recent Disorders and Existing Unrest.                              1.  Prior to the War.     The disorders which  broke out in  March 1919 were  brought  to a climax byspecific events connected  with  the  war, but they  can by no means  be attributedsolely to recent  or contemporary conditions  and  the ground  had   been  preparedthrough a long antecedent period.     It appears  to be   frequently  assumed  in current  talk and  writing  in  thiscountry that Egypt is a part  of  the British Empire.   This  is not  and  never has beenthe case./
    The &quot;special position&quot; which Great Britain occupies in Egypt  dates  from herintervention in 1882 to restore  order during the Arabi rebellion-an  intervention inwhich the other Powers, though invited, declined to participate.  This threw  upon herresponsibilities  which she could not decline, and which could only  be discharged bythe occupation of the country, until at least there was a reasonable  certainty that order would be maintained and the lives and property of foreign residents rendered secure.But at that time it was the declared intention of the British Government to evacuate thecountry so soon as these objects were accomplished, and in 1887 Sir Henry DrummondWolff was despatched to Constantinople to prepare  the way for evacuation.  He drewup a Convention with the Sultan whereby Great Britain agreed to withdraw her troops from Egypt at the end  of three years provided that there was then no new danger,external or internal, to  require their retention, and provided  further that she shouldhave the right of  reoccupying  the  country if any such danger arose.  It was  only atthe last moment that the Sultan under foreign pressure withheld his  signature and thenegotiations fell through.    But, though Great Britain remained in  Egypt, she did nothing during  the nexttwenty-seven years either to legalise her own position or to  disturb  the theory that egypt was an autonomous nationality under the suzerainty of the Sultan of Turkey.Egypt was  in theory governed by the Khedive, the  Council of  Egyptian Ministers,the Egyptian Legislative Council and Assembly;  and the British Representative was inname merely &quot; Agent and  Consul-General,&quot;  the  exponent, like the  Representatives ofother Powers, of the views and wishes of his Government  to the Government  of Egypt.Though, in virtue of  the Army  of  Occupation and of the numerous  duties  and responsibilities  which circumstances gradually imposed on him, he came to be the realarbiter of the country,  he was  always studiously careful to observe this theory, and the observance of it was regarded  by Egyptians  as an implied pledge  that the occupying power did not intend to impair the national status of their country.    It was also so regarded by foreign Powers, and when  the Anglo-French Agreementof .1904 was concluded, a declaration was signed in London to the following effect:           &quot;His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government declare that they have ho intention of    altering the political status of Egypt.   The Government  of the French  Republic,    for their part, declare that they will  not obstruct the action  of Great Britain in    that country, by asking that a limit of time be fixed  for the British occupation or    in any other manner.&quot;    This  understanding would no  doubt  have served for all practical  purposes, ifEuropean peace had been maintained.  But  with the outbreak of war and the entry ofTurkey into the war or. the side  of the  enemy, questions of  extreme difficulty arose.Egyptians were nominally subjects of the Sultan of Turkey,  owing  allegiance to him and not to  the  British  Crown.   This was obviously an intolerable situation.   But the mere abolition of Turkish suzerainty by an act of war would  have  deprived Egypt ofany definite status and  left her in the position of a former Turkish  dependency in thehands of Great Britain.  This difficulty might, of course, have  been summarily disposedof by the annexation of Egypt to  the British Empire,  but  the  British Governmentdeliberately chose a less drastic course which  would  afford  security to Egypt, while leaving  the principle of an Egyptian national entity  unimpaired.   This was to  placeEgypt under the protection of Great Britain.   A proclamation was  accordingly issued in the Official Journal on the 18th December, 1914 :          &quot; His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs gives notice    that in  view of the state of war arising out of the action of Turkey, Egypt is placed    under the  protection of His  Majesty,  and  will henceforth  constitute  a British    Protectorate.          The  suzerainty of Turkey over Egypt is thus terminated,  and  His  Majesty&apos;s    Government will  adopt all measures  necessary for   the defence  of Egypt and    protect its  inhabitants and interests.&quot;On the  following day a further  proclamation was  issued  deposing Abbas Hilmi,the then Khedive, on  the  ground  that he  had adhered  to the  King&apos;s  enemies, andannounqing that  the  succession had been offered to  and accepted .by  His  HighnessPrince Hussein Kamel, with the title of Sultan of Egypt,    It has been constantly asserted by Egyptian Nationalists  that they understood the protectorate to  be merely a war measure,  and the defence of  Egypt  promised under itin the second clause  of the  Proclamation to be limited  to defence in the war.   the wording of the  Proclamation seems to us to offer no ground for this  interpretation,.buti
the Egyptians were  certainly given  to  understand  that efforts would be made at theend of the war to satisfy their national aspirations, and great  pains  were taken (to assure them  that their  national status was not changed for the worse by the Protec-torate.  For  example, in the telegram which he addressed  to Sultan Hussein on hisaccession to the Sultanate, His Majesty the King used these words :          &quot; On the occasion when your Highness enters upon your high office, I desire    to convey to your Highness the expression of my most sincere friendship and the    assurance of my unfailing support in safeguarding the integrity of Egypt, and in    securing her future well-being and prosperity.         &quot; Your Highness has  been called upon  to undertake the responsibilities of    your high office at a grave crisis in the national life of Egypt, and I feel convinced    that you will be able, with the co-operation of your  Ministers and the Protectorate    of Great Britain, successfully to overcome all the influences which are seeking to    destroy the  independence of Egypt, and the wealth, liberty and happiness of its    people.&quot;    It should be added  that Egyptian Nationalists  are able to point to a long series ofdeclarations by British statesmen disowning the idea of annexing, or even permanentlyoccupying, the country,  aud affirming, in the words  of Sir Eldon Gorst, that  &quot; thefundamental  idea &quot; of the British  Government &quot; has  been to prepare the Egyptiansfor self-government, while helping  them in the meantime to enjoy the benefit of good government.&quot;   Englishmen   are aware of  the circumstances which  have till  nowprevented the fulfilment of these pledges, but they are naturally treasuied by Egyptiansand too easily made the ground of accusations of bad  faith.   It is necessary to  bearthem  in mind, if we would  understand the resentment of Egyptians at the commonassumption that Egypt is a British  possession or  that the  Protectorate  has naturallymade it so.    The situation in Egypt has therefore  always  remained an abnormal one since theBritish Occupation  in 1882.  In  the initial stages, problems which appeared almostinsuperable had been surmounted with remarkable success under an exceptionally ableadministrator, and as time went on, and the machine appeared superficially to be runningsmoothly, public opinion in  Great Britain ceased to concern itself with the indefinitecharacter of the situation. But in reality a settlement was becoming progressively more urgent, the more  widely the  influence of our presence in Egypt and the introduction of western methods made themselves felt.   With the removal of that fear of  oppressionwhich in old  days had made Egyptians acquiescent and  submissive, new impulses andambitions  were  inevitably aroused.   The Egyptians of 1920, whether townsmen orpeasants,  are different  people  from those of  1910, and very different indeed   fromthe Egyptians of 1890.  We have never honestly faced the Egyptian problem, and ourneglect to do so is in a measure responsible for the present situation.    The regime inaugurated by the late Lord  Cromer to redeem a bankrupt adminis-tration was never more  than a provisional one, because for  many years there was noreason to  believe that the  Occupation,  which we had in  1887 actually agreed to terminate,  would be other than  of brief duration.   But  provisional and extemporisedexpedients gradually hardened into  established institutions and  the  stronger element in a  combination of administrative  forces tended  to  become the dominant  one, toacquire powers and responsibilities not originally  contemplated,  and to  restrict theEgyptian element in the public service to a secondary position.   The  policy pursued in the early days of the Occupation had been to engage a restricted number of carefully selected British officials to advise and assist, especially in the Finance  and Irrigationservices.   A Judicial and Educational Adviser were, in due course, added, and  lateragain an Adviser to the Interior, with a body of Inspectors for the Provinces.  So longas their numbers were strictly limited, and only men of  high capacity and experiencewere  appointed, not only was the  co-operation of British  officials tolerated, but  theywere themselves regarded with esteem and affection.    As the resources  at the disposal of Egypt  increased  the  public  services  were greatly expanded, and with this expansion the obligation arose concurrently to add tothe number of foreign  assistants and experts.  Thus,  with  the prolongation of theOccupation, the number  of  British officials in  Egypt steadily  increased, and theprinciple that the aim of the administration should be to train and equip Egyptians to manage their own affairs fell into  the background.   In  spite of the fact that EgyptianMinisters have of recent years taken a greater part and a more direct interest in  their departments than in the early days of the Occupation, when many of them were content with little more than an honorary position, the work of Under-Secretaries and heads of
departments, for the most part non-Egyptian, has become increasingly independent ofthe Council  of Ministers.  A growing resentment at the number of posts monopolisedby the British was noticed for a long period antecedent to the war.   Egyptian officials of long experience and considerable competence felt that they were definitely excludedfrom rising  to the highest positions in view of the system consecrated by prescriptionthat a post once held by  a  non-Egyptian  was, on  its becoming vacant, automaticallyfilled by  a non-Egyptian.    Particular resentment was occasioned  in Egypt at the  time of  the arrival of theMission  by  a recent increase in  the numbers of the British  engaged for the publicservice.  This  increase, if it was  greatly exaggerated  by ill-informed rumour, was nevertheless appreciable, and affected also a few very subordinate offices hitherto filled by natives  of the country.   It  may here  be  mentioned that the number of  british officials has risen from a few hundred in the earlier years of the occupation to upwards of sixteen hundred at  the present day, with scales of  pay different from those enjoyed by the Egyptians.   These higher scales, if amply justified  by special  circumstances,.were  readily represented as constituting a  grievance.     Another feature of Egyptian life has undoubtedly contributed to the unrest.   as british officials have increased in number they have more and more  lived  apart  fromthe Egyptian community, and their chief residential quarter on the Island of Ghezirehhas come  to be a self-contained community, furnished, like an Indian  cantonment,with a complete equipment for social  intercourse, sport  and physical exercise.  Thishas added to the amenities of life for the official class, but it has withdrawn them fromsociety with Egyptians and tended to create a British  enclave from  which  Egyptiansare excluded.  We are aware of the difficulties on both sides which  stand  in  the wayof free and  unembarrassed relations between men  and women of different races and customs, but when the necessary allowance has been  made  it must, we think, be saidthat the increasing segregation of the British  community, which has been a feature of recent years, has been a cause of  estrangement between British and Egyptians and made the fact of an alien occupation more  obtrusive than it need have been.     We have noticet!  with pleasure the cordial and intimate relations which many oldresidents in Egypt, and  not a  few senior. officials and their wives, have established with their Egyptian neighbours, and we have  seen much  evidence  of the value and influence of these friendships  in the recent  times of stress and difficulty.   We  are convinced   that it  won Id greatly help if  more  efforts  were made  to cultivate  theseneighbourly relations.  The forms and conventions of conduct  should  be studied andcarefully respected by British residents in  Egypt and visitors to Egypt.  It should berealised, especially by the latter, that  altogether  disproportionate harm may  be done by offences against good  taste which, though trivial in themselves, cause comment andscandal. It should, in general,  be the aim of  the  British residents  and visitors tobreak down the barriers  that exist  rather than to create new ones, to enter as far as possible into the life  of  the Egyptian people, to learn enough of  their  language tomake social contact possible and agreeable, and to avoid the minor causes of offence which in the aggregate become mischievous.     On the other hand, a  criticism  not  infrequently heard that the quality of  the British  officials has deteriorated does not seem to us to  be justified.  There are  many officials of  high  capacity  in  Egypt  to-day,  as  there were in  former times men of exceptional and  others  of  only moderate  calibre.    But the  critical sense  of  the Egyptians  has been greatly developed by progress and contact with other countries, and  they  have  become  more  exacting  than  the older  generation with regard to standards of efficiency.     Again, since the retirement in 1907 of Lord Cromer, there  have been no  less than five British Agents or High Commissioners, and Egypt has felt herself to some extent a field for  successive  experiments.  The  result of tiiese repeated  changes, due to the accident of circumstances,  tended to increase  the  independence  of. the permanent British  officials,  who  were more concerned with departmental efficiency than with questions of policy, while to Egyptian observers they conveyed an impression  of uncer- tainty and  instability.      Another contributory cause of the general  discontent was the  manifest  insuccess of educational policy  resulting  in the production  of an unnecessarily large and ever- increasing number of  candidates for official posts, provided with examination certificates,. but destitute of any real educational culture.   It was necessary in the initial stage to train a  number of young men to such a standard of efficiency as would enable them to undertake  clerical duties  in State  departments which  had  hitherto  been  largely performed by non-Egyptians, and to prepare pupils for the higher colleges of  medicine, law and engineering.  But  here again there seems, until  quite recently, to have been
little attempt to revise a system adopted under exceptional circumstances or to realise that changing conditions required new methods.  Education, for which there is a real and crying demand among the people, remains atrophied.   The mass of the population is  not  only  still  illiterate, but  without  social  or moral  training.   The  only  realeducation in the higher sense available in the country itself  is provided by religious or benevolent institutions, controlled for the most part by the French or Americans, orby  the admirable Victoria College, which  owes its institution  to the British  residentsat Alexandria.   In spite of these criticisms,  however,  it must  be admitted that thegeneral level of instruction has greatly advanced  since the early years of the Occupa-tion, and that the number of those capable of  taking an intelligent interest in public affairs is very much larger to-day.     Nationalist propaganda has been at work for many years in Egypt.  The  evolution of a sane and  moderate Nationalist  spirit might have  been regarded  with sympathy and interest, and, indeed, the late Lord Cromer had hopes that it  might be turned togood account.  But unfortunate political  rivalries among the Western Powers led it from the first  to  assume an  anti-British colour.  The Nationalists  were  alternatelyencouraged and opposed by the ex-Khedive  for  his own personal  aims.  Their rankswere swelled  by the members of a  thoroughly dissatisfied civil service, who regarded the presence  of the British as a bar to promotion, and  who  were  further discouraged by a system of selection which made it possible for the influential  to secure the preier-ment of relations and dependents.  The increasing number of the students who lookonly to  State employment as a reward for the  often real  sacrifices made in order to qualify  for  it,  and  who  regard their  prospects of obtaining any  appointment asdiminished by  the competition  of  the foreigner, made  them a ready  instrument forsuch propaganda in the provinces.     Finally, there is the latent but ever-present  impatience of the Moslem with  Christianrule.  That a Mohammedan should  occupy a position of political  subordination  to aChristian is opposed  to the essential spirit of Islam, and the  sentiment  which thisspirit has  engendered survives long after strong  religious  feeling has been greatlyattenuated, or even become altogether extinct.   Its existence no  doubt exercised  aninfluence in creating  a prejudice which the religious element would make the most ofagainst  the name  of.  Protectorate, interpreted  as  implying the permanent subjectionof a Mahommedan Ruler and State  to a Christian Sovereign.   There is in the East apatriotism of  religion  which is  an even more fundamental sentiment than the patriotismof home and tradition.                               2. During the War.     Such were  the influences which  had long been active when in 1914 Turkey, the seat of the Caliphate, entered the  war  as the  enemy of the occupying  Power, and Germanagents freely promised the liberation of Egypt from British control after the final victory which they confidently predicted.   In these circumstances, and in  view of the spirit of hostility towards the occupying Power which had been gathering volume over a numberof years, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Egypt was no doubt well advised,in the Proclamation  announcing the  state of war with  Turkey, to make it clear thatGreat Britain took upon herself &quot; the  solemn burden of the present war without callingon the Egyptian people for aid therein.&quot;   It is, however, only just to record that, what-ever may have  been the hopes  or anticipations  raised by the war in a certain section ofthe Egyptians,  the obligations and  disabilities which it entailed upon the people  wereborne with patience and goodwill;  that the services rendered  by the Egyptian LabourCorps were of inestimable value and  indispensable to the campaign in Palestine; and thatthe Sultan&apos;s Government supported  the British  authorities in a spirit of the most cordialco-operation, evidenced among other things by their writing off the suspense accountunder which  Egypt would have been entitled to reclaim advances of 3 millions sterling.     So far we have only dealt with the causes  of unrest  in Cairo and the larger centresduring the period  preceding the riots which broke out in March 1919.  It  remains toconsider the reasons  which  affected the fellah in and  made them  susceptible tonationalist agitation and propaganda.     Unrest among the educated classes  in Egypt  was, as has  already been pointedout, manifest long before the  crisis of 1919.   But  that it  should  have spread to thefellahin, and should have led to outbreaks of savage violence among a class, which hasderived such immense benefits from the British Occupation, needs  explaining.     ,     In the first place, it may be laid  down that the agitation among the fellahin was of  a far more partial  character than has been generally  supposed,  and that  disorderswere confined to the neighbourhood of large centres and to  districts  along  the  mainlines of communication.  In remoter villages, less readily accessible to propagandists
and  agitators, little disposition  was shown by  the  small farmers to take part in anysuch movement.   Where disorders occurred, it was  generally the railways which became the object of  aggression, and there is reason to believe  that  the attacks upon them were carried out in pursuance of a pre-existing plan for a Germano-Turkish.attack on the Canal, supported by a simultaneous rising in Egypt.  This would account for certain indications of concerted action revealed in the  disturbances of March 1919.    There is some evidence to show that discontent  was stimulated,  by the controlledprice of cotton, which  denied the cultivator the advantage of competing in foreing markets, while the rent of his land continued to advance.  But the more obvious factorsarising  out of the war to alienate his goodwill were: (a) The  recruiting for theEgyptian Labour and Camel Transport Corps ; (6) the requisition of domestic animals ;(c) the requisition  of cereals ;  (d) the collections  for the Red Cross Fund,   in each case it  was  not so  much  the measures themselves  that  were  resented as  the mannerin which they were carried out.     As regards (a), the recruiting  for the Egyptian Labour  and Camel TransportCorps, it seems evident that once enrolled the men were, as  a  rule, satisfied with theconditions, and that the wages paid were of great benefit to  the poorer classes of thepopulation.   The hospital accommodation provided  for them  dees not seem to havebeen altogether satisfactory, and there were evidently among their officers many ignorantof their language and without experience in handling them.  But their readiness  tore-enlist again  and again, and the fact that those actually serving  gave no troubleduring  the  events of March   1919,  shews  that  grievances against the service  werenot serious.  So long as the Labour Corps was locally raised from volunteers  arrange-ments worked satisfactorily.   There was some discontent at the prolongation of service&quot;beyond the contractual period after recruiting was taken over by a military organisation.But  it  was after the  voluntary system had  ceased  to  supply a sufficient number  of recruits, and when administrative pressure was applied to obtain them,  that abusesbegan.  In view of the announcement made at the outbreak  of war with Turkey thatEgyptians would not be required to take part in it, the voluntary system was maintained in name,  but  measures of compulsion  were applied by  the Omdehs,  the  unpaidadministrative  officers in the country districts,  to  whom recruiting  was  entrustedwithout  supervision by  British  officials, most of whom had  been  recalled for  dutieselsewhere.   There is  no doubt that unscrupulous  Omdehs took advantage of theposition, sending their enemies to  serve, while letting off their friends, arid acceptingbribes for exemptions and substitutions.   In some  cases measures  resembling  thoseof the press gang  were adopted, and British  pressure was asserted  as the excuse forthem.   As to the extent of the abuses there  seems to be some conflict of opinion.  Butthey were frequent enough to. cause much discontent in  certain regions,  and gave the political agitator his  opportunity.     As regards (b), the  requisition  of domestic animals, though the fellah  was oftenhardly  hit by the  removal  of  his means of transport, prices  which were good  at  thetime seem to have been paid when the  animals were taken.   On the other hand  theprices at which they could be bought back at the  end of the war were often considerably higher.  While the fellahin  were naturally most unwilling to part with their animals,there does not appear to have  been much real ground for  grievance  on account ofthese requisitions, inevitable  in a state of war.   But they naturally would not tend toincrease goodwill  towards those held responsible for them.     A more fertile source of discontent was (c),  the requisition of  cereals.   Owing tothe demand for the army prices advanced, and market rates were considerably higherthan requisition rates.   Districts were assessed  to furnish a given quantity, and  thecollection was left to local officials, who derived large profits from the transaction. Notonly did Omdehs collect larger amounts than they were required to furnish at requisitionrates and sell the balance at the higher market rate, but individuals who  possessed  nowheat had to buy their quota at market rates and hand it over at the lower requisitionrate.   The  process of verification  and repayment was slow, and  it appears  to  besubstantiated from the evidence submitted  that  the  provincial officials  retained the sums received to make payments in their own hands for long  periods, and that Omdehsand Sheikhs, who  were entrusted with sums  in  bulk for distribution, in many casesheld back a portion of  these  moneys.   The local officials were mainly responsible forthe  abuses which  occurred, but they were  attributed to the British, who,  under the exceptional conditions prevailing, were unable to control them.     As  regards (d),  the collections for the  Red Cross Fund, these were organisedlocally by Egyptian Mamurs  and  Omdehs, and while  intended to be voluntary, were,in  practice, frequently made  compulsory by officials seeking  to acquire  merit  by the
 amounts which their districts contributed.   There was a current belief in the country that only a portion of the total amount collected reached its  real destination.   It is open to question whether it was prudent or opportune, under the special  conditions prevailing in Egypt, where  the opposition of  Cross and  Crescent was  inevitably emphasised,  to  do more  than notify  the  opening  of a fund  for  the aid  of the wounded, to  which many wealthy Egyptians and  resident foreigners would no doubt have responded.   To entrust the collection to local Egyptian  officials was inevitably to open the door to abuses, entailing additional pressure on the poorer classes, with whom many other circumstances made the war unpopular.  It should be added that the Joint Committee of the British Red Cross and the Order of St. John, after  the close of the war, assigned upwards of a 100,0001 for the  relief of victims of the war in the Egyptian Labour Corps and their families.     In addition  to the specific  grievances, to which  attention has been drawn, there was  in  Egypt also  an unprecedented  and  progressive rise in prices,  especially the necessaries  of life, such  as corn,  clothing and fuel, which weighed  heavily on the poorer classes, whose  wages were  quite inadequate  to  meet the enhanced cost of living, while  they  saw a limited number of their countrymen and the  unpopular foreigner making large fortunes.  A  family  of  four a man, his  wife and  two small children could not, at the beginning of 1919, obtain a sufficiency of food except at a cost which considerably exceeded the  ordinary rate of wages.     These various factors  had contributed by the end of 1918 to  create a condition of discontent  and  unrest  among the  fellahin  and  some  loss  of  confidence  in  the benefits of British administration.  There was thus  a favourable field in  which the agitator  could work.   The fellah had seen  no  British officials for a  long period, and none  had intervened  to  protect him from  inequitable demands.  Even before the war, the once familiar figure of the British inspector riding through the fields and stopping to listen to the  small farmers claims  and  grievances had  almost disappeared, and motor-cars conveyed  the hurried official  from one administrative  centre to another. His disappearance made it easier to believe reports which were spread of the imminent departure of  the  British, when the  land would be divided  among the fellahin, with an unrestricted water supply and no  taxation.  There is also reason to believe, though there are no grounds  for suspecting the leaders of  the Nationalist Party of  their inspiration, that highly-coloured and wholly  imaginary accounts of outrages committed on  native women by British soldiers and  murderous  assaults on the villages  were circulated by unprincipled agitators,  and  that  a spirit of  vindictive  resentment was thus aroused, which culminated in the brutal murders of British soldiers at Dei rut.     The death of Sultan Hussein in 1917 had removed from the scene a ruler of character and ability, who  thoroughly understood  his own countrymen.   He had accepted the onerous position  of  the first Sultan  of Egypt  as  a not  too welcome  duty, and had loyally and courageously co-operated  in the  difficult  task  of administering a Moslem State in occupation by a Christian Power at  war with the  Sovereign  who represented the Caliphate of Islam.   He had to a great extent lived  down the unpopularity whichhis substitution for his nephew had at first aroused, and enjoyed the general regard ofall classes.   His successor, who had been educated in Italy, and had served  for a timein the Italian Army, was regarded as something of a foreigner, and found himself fromthe first in a  much weaker  position as regards  his own countrymen, on whom he had as yet little  hold.  With the  best will in  the  world,  therefore,  he could  have littleinfluence in  stemming the rising tide  of anti-British sentiment which was  gathering strength.                                3.  After the  War.    In the preceding pages we have endeavoured to describe the internal situation in Egypt up to the concluding phases of the war.  It will now be  more readily under- stood why the principles enunciated by President Wilson and approved by  the  Allies produced an  immediate and decisive  effect on Egyptian opinion.   The acceptance of the idea of self-determination  appeared to give international sanction  to  sentiments which had long been maturing  among the educated, classes.     Those in Egypt who had anticipated,  and would at one time even have  welcomed, a German and Turkish victory, now found a favourable opportunity for shifting  their ground.  This section now claimed that by contributing morally and materially to the victory of the Allies Egypt had herself been instrumental in  throwing off all that was left of the Turkish yoke.     At the same time the voice of moderate  opinion in Egypt also began to urge that the time had come to assert a claim  to self-government consistent with the repeated declarations  of British statesmen regarding the  provisional character of  our  inter- vention.   It  was genuinely felt that the attitude of the  country as a whole during the war, the co-operation  of the Sultan and his  Ministers, and the conspicuous sacrifices
which  the  Egyptian people had  been called  upon  to make, entitled them  to theparticular  consideration  of Great  Britain.  The idea of  definitely  regulating therelations  between Great Britain and  Egypt  had,  indeed,  already  been  mooted  byRushdi Pasha, the Prime Minister, at the end of 19.1.7.     This movement  received  great  encouragement from  the publication,  in  thebeginning of November  1918, of the  Anglo-French  declaration regarding Syria and mesopotamia, which  announced that  Great Britain and  France  contemplated thecomplete and  definitive  enfranchisement of  the   peoples  liberated from  Turkishoppression and  the institution among  them of national Governments deriving their authority from  the initiative and free choice of the people  themselves.   The  HighCommissioner (Sir R. Wingate) did  not fail to point  out  that  the  policy indicated inthis declaration would have its repercussion in  Egypt.  Moreover, the Egyptians had recently  witnessed  the establishment  of an independent kingdom  in Arabia, whichthey had always  regarded  as  far  behind  their own half-occidentalised country incivilisation and development.     At the very moment  when these ideas were being widely discussed, public  opinion was greatly  stirred  by  the  revelation of  a  confidential  memorandum, which wasinterpreted as denying to Egypt the privileges of self-government advocated for  other less advanced communities.  A special commission  to consider constitutional reformhad been nominated  at  the  beginning of 1918, and Sir Wm. Brunyate, the ActingFinancial Adviser, was requested by this  commission to draw up a  note to serve as abasis for their discussions.   He was invited, in particular, to examine the  principle ofgiving the  foreign  colonies some  share  in  the  legislation  of  the  country, whichmight  render more. acceptable  to  the Powers the  surrender of  the practical  vetoexercised by them under the Capitulations over a  considerable field of legislature.Sir Wm. Brunyate&apos;s note gave  great  offence to the Prime  Minister, to whom it was presented in the  middle  of  November 1918, and, though intended only as a basis forconfidential discussion, its contents  became generally known.  A storm of protest wasaroused by a project which was interpreted as  assigning only consultative functions toan Egyptian Legislative Assembly, while bestowing all legislative power on a Senatein which the officially-nominated members and a group of elected  foreigners would constitute the majority.     Simultaneously with the commission  above referred to, another commission hadbeen sitting for many months  to consider the judicial reforms which would  become necessary in the event of the abolition of the Capitulations.   Although this commission had issued no report, a general impression prevailed  that it contemplated the super-session of the Mixed  Tribunals by  new Courts in  which the English language andBritish legal procedure would predominate a measure which would  entail disabilitieson the  native Bar and paralyse the foreign advocates who had hitherto used the Frenchlanguage.  This  assumption tended to confirm the hostility of the legal  profession toany extended affirmation  of British control.     On  the 13th  November,  1918,  Zaghlul  Pasha, with two other leaders of the advanced Nationalist group, paid a visit to the High Commissioner and expressed their desire  to go to London in order to put forward a programme of &quot; complete autonomy &quot;for Egypt.   Simultaneously, the Prime Minister,  Rushdi  Pasha, proposed  that heshould himself, together with Adli Pasha Yeghen, the Minister of  Education,  proceedto London to discuss the  affairs  of Egypt, a plan which he stated had the full approvalof the Sultan.   The  contention of  these Ministers was that the Peace Congress wouldgive official consecration to the  Protectorate, and that therefore its nature could not beleft undefined.   Under the Turkish suzerainty Egypt had had certain rights, and  they desired  to know what their rights would be as  against  Great  Britain under the protectorate.     Sir  R. Wingate reported these proposals to the Foreign Office, and was informed in reply  that &quot; no useful purpose  would be served by allowing Nationalist leaders tocome to London,&quot; and that the visit of the two Ministers would not be &quot; opportune&quot; atthat moment.  The Foreign Secretary explained that, owing to the fact that he andother  Ministers  would  be  absent  from  London  in  connection  with the peacenegotiations, they would &quot; not be able to devote sufficient time and attention to problemsof Egyptian internal reform.&quot;   In these circumstances the Ministers were  invited to&quot; defer their visit.&quot;  Rushdi Pasha gave the High Commissioner to understand that he regarded the refusal of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give him an immediate  hearingas involving an interpretation of the meaning of the Protectorate to which he could not agree  and tendered his  resignation.   There were no doubt obvious difficulties in theway of discussing such  questions with the Egyptian Ministers at a moment  of highpolitical  pressure, when  the Peace Conference was  about to open, but  it would appear
 that, in spite  of  the  insistence with which the High Commissioner appealed for their reception, the real  urgency of dealing with  the  Egyptian problem at that  critical moment had not been  realised.     Every effort was  made to induce Itushdi  Pasha to withdraw his resignation, and a prospective date for the eventual  visit  of  the Ministers was  indicated.  But the position of the Nationalists had now become  so strong in Egypt that the  Ministers were only willing  to go if  Zaghlul Pasha and  his friends were allowed to do  the same. As it was not considered expedient to permit this, they adhered to their resignation, and the High  Commissioner was instructed to come to  England himself to report on the situation.     The result of these events was that a number of the Moderate Party joined the advanced  Nationalists, who now advocated a more far-reaching policy, while  their agents  initiated a violent anti-British campaign throughout the  country, where, owing to the calls of the  flag, only a relatively small number of  British  officials remained.     While the proposed  visit of  Egyptian  Ministers  to London  was  still under consideration in the  beginning  of  19111,  a document was addressed to the  foreign representatives and residents in Egypt announcing the constitution of a &quot; Delegation &quot; of  twelve  members, under the chairmanship of Zaghlul Pasha, which proposed to lay the legitimate aspirations  of  Egypt before other  countries.   The majority  of the Delegation were identical with those included  in a Nationalist  Committee of fourteen formed at  the end  of the preceding year.     On tho  3rd March  the Delegation above referred to presented to the  Sultan a petition which was generally interpreted as an  attempt to intimidate His Highness and deter him from appointing a  new  Government.  This  proceeding was  felt to  be a challenge which could not be  declined, and  Sir Milne Cheetham,  acting for  the High Commissioner,  decided  with  the  approval  of  the British  Government to  deport Zaghlul Pasha and  three of his  most active  adherents  to  Malta.  This  gave  rise to renewed agitation  and  protest, beginning with anti-British demonstrations on the part of students in Cairo which quickly necessitated military intervention.  Similar outbreaks were soon reported from the provinces.  On the 12th March disturbances broke out at Tanta and were quelled by the military, not, however, without bloodshed.   By the 14th and 15th March the  trouble had spread to most of the Delta provinces, where  attempts to  interrupt  communications  had  become general.  Looting,   pillaging,  attacks  on British  troops, and murders of British soldiers and civilians were reported from many quarters.  On the .16th the  railway and telegraphic communication between Cairo and the Delta, as well as  with Upper Egypt, was  broken.  By  the  18th the provinces of Behera, Gharbia, Menufia and  Dakhalia were in a state of open  revolt.  Upper Egypt and the foreigners living there were  completely cut off,  while  the fanaticism  of the insurgents culminated  the same day in the  murder at Deirut of two British officers and five other ranks and  of an  English  Inspector of Government  Prisons in  the Assiut- Minia train.   By the 26th  March, however, the situation, from a purely  military point of view, had  become stabilised.  The main railway  and  telegraphic  communications had been  re-established and the necessary dispositions  of troops had been  made for their adequate protection.   Mobile columns had been moved in various directions to control the more violent areas,  to arrest and bring to justice those responsible for the excesses, and to re-establish civil control.  The outlying centres of disturbance in  the south had been relieved and  the first and most dangerous phase of the disorders was over.     Thus, within a week from the  deportation of Zaghlul Pasha and his  associates, a movement  anti-British and  even  anti- European had assumed grave proportions.  It was a national movement backed by the sympathy of all  classes  and creeds among the Egyptian population,  including the  Copts,  and on the part of its more  fanatical adherents it took the form of the systematic destruction 01  property and communica- tions, with an increasing disregard for human life.  Responsible though the Delegation undoubtedly  was for the organisation of the original demonstrations out of which the movement  grew, its  more responsible members soon became alarmed at the  develop- ment of a situation which rapidly passed out of their control and fell into the  hands of irresponsible extremists,  supported by  a certain   number  of   undesirable  foreignelements.     The Commander-in-Chief  in Egypt, Field-Marshal Lord Allenby, had left to join the Peace Conference  at Paris  on the .1.2th March.  He  was, however, back  again in cairo by the 25th,  having been  in the meantime appointed Special  High  Commissionerduring  the absence  of Sir  R.  Wingate, the  High  Commissioner, in England.  his instructions were to &quot;restore law and order&quot; and &quot; to administer in all matters as maybe required by the necessity of maintaining  the King&apos;s  Protectorate on a secure and equitable basis.&quot;  The military measures  which had  been taken had rendered the
situation outwardly calm.   But there was little  diminution of anti-British sentiment,which  was  now  chiefly manifested against the military  element, whose behaviourduring  the  repression  of  disorder  was speciously misrepresented.   Lawyers  and students continued to strike, and many officials absented themselves from their duties.    The conciliatory disposition  adopted  by  the  Special  High  Commissioner inaddressing a group of notables who visited him by invitation did not prevent theoutbreak on the 2nd  April of a  general  strike, which  had, however,  practicallysubsided by  the  6th.   Meanwhile,  in  pursuance of his policy  of conciliation,  lord allenby, with, the approval of His  Majesty&apos;s Government, completely removed the embargo on  the departure  of Egyptians desiring to travel, a measure which carriedwith it the  release  from  Malta of Zaghlul  Pasha and  his  three associates.  Thus,within  a month  of  their   deportation,  the  policy then  adopted was reversed,  andthe leaders  of the  movement became free  either to return  to  Egypt or to proceedelsewhere to renew their campaign of agitation.    Such, in brief, was  the course of events in the first four months of the year .1919.It is obvious, after the event, that Egyptian  Ministers should  have been encouraged tocome to London when they proposed to do so, and Sir Reginald Wingate, whose advice on this subject was fully justified by the  sequel, would have done well, in our opinion,to urge his views  with even greater insistency. After this initial mistake events movedmore  rapidly in  Egypt  than  the  Administration  appear  to  have realised.   Theconsequences of deporting the Nationalist leaders were  not  rightly estimated, and therevoking of that measure, after serious disturbances had taken place, necessarily gave the impression that British policy was wavering and  liable to  quick changes under the pressure of agitation.  In the next  stage, punitive measures for the murder of british officers and  other outrages  committed during the rebellion became a necessity,  and though  carried  out,  on  the whole,  Avith moderation,  they inevitably prolonged theperiod   of  exasperation.   The  Administration  endeavoured to conciliate  Egyptiansentiment by transferring a large number of the trials, after the most urgent cases hadbeen dealt with by martial law, to the ordinary tribunals, b.ut  by this time Nationalistopinion had  hardened, and  the almost invariable result was that evidence ceased to be forthcoming  and  that  the  accused  were  acquitted.  In  the meantime,   ZaghlulPasha and his colleagues had, on their release from Malta, proceeded to Paris, in thehope of  obtaining  a hearing for  Egypt&apos;s  claim to  independence from the PeaceConference.   On failing  to achieve this object,  they devoted  all their  energies to obtaining foreign support for their cause, and an emissary was despatched to america to canvass opinion in the  United States.  At the same time,  their adherents in Egyptworked with the greatest industry to complete their organisation, collecting large sums of money and extending their propaganda to all parts of the country.  Their activities in this latter sphere were  largely concentrated upon the exploitation of the  existing conditions of industrial  unrest, resulting  in a succession of more  or less serious strikes.By  this time it had  been announced  that the British Government intended to  send theSpecial Mission to Egypt, but, having made  up  their minds that its object  would bethe extinction of Egyptian nationality, the  agitators concentrated their attention onlimiting the  sphere of its activities by an organised boycott.           (B.) The Nationalist Movement and Egyptian  Aspirations.    Enough has been said to explain the rapid growth of the Nationalist movement.It is more difficult to give, within a reasonable compass,  a  correct and at the sametime intelligible  analysis  of its real nature and objects.    It has been, said, that  &quot; every  Egyptian worth his salt is at heart a Nationalist.&quot;This is only true of the educated and semi-educated classes,  who constitute less than10 per cent, of the  fourteen million inhabitants of Egypt.   It would be meaninglessas applied to the 92 per  cent, of  illiterates and especially to the fellahin,  who aretwo-thirds  of  the  whole  people.    The  turbulent  crowds  of  the  great townsmay indeed be easily worked up to excitement by political  catchwords, which  theyvociferate without  understanding.   But the fellahin, as a  body, are normally  veryindifferent to politics.   They are a primitive peasantry, living on the land and by theland, to which they  are passionately devoted, and from which,  though  working withrude instruments and with little  aid from agricultural science, they raise by theirmatchless industry and perfect knowledge  of the soil those wonderful crops whichare the bed-rock of Egyptian prosperity.   Their whole  interest in life centres inthese crops and in the regular supply of Nile water, without which their fields would&apos;be  barren.   But while  their  outlook remains  limited  their independence  has developed, and they are far more tenacious of  their rights  than in the  old  days ofdespotism.
     The fellahin, when left alone, are not unfriendly  to the British.    No doubtthey do not love any foreigner, and as fervent Moslems they start with a certainantipathy to any Christian.  But, in the case of the British, these initial prejudiceshave to a large  extent been overcome by experience of the integrity and kindlinessof the general run of British officials and by the manifest improvement which their presence has wrought in the condition of rural Egypt.  It is true that a new genera-tion. which has  never known the evils of the old regime, is  less grateful to us thanwere their  fathers, by whom these evils&apos; were vividly remembered.   But the fellahin,though  much less helpless and submissive than  in former times,  have still cause todread the rapacity of landowners and the bullying and extortion of a good numberof native officials, and against these dangers they feel that British  influence affordsthem a certain protection.  Those unfortunate incidents of the war  period, to whichwe have already alluded,  shook  for a  time  their confidence  in our justice  andgood-will, and were predisposing causes of the savage outbreak of anti-British feeling in the spring of 1919.  But these excesses were abnormal and short-lived.   except where they are directly stirred up by agitation from the towns, the fellahin appearto be once  more  reasonably well disposed to those British people whom they know,and who know how to handle them.  We were  greatly  struck by the evidence of anumber of our countrymen, official and  unofficial, living in close contact  with  theEgyptian peasantry, who affirmed that  the bitter  feeling  of  the last year or twohad now subsided, and that Englishmen who conducted  themselves properly were aswelcome as ever in the countryside.     But it is idle  to hope  that  the comparatively satisfactory  attitude of  thepeasantry will long be maintained, if our relations with the middle and upper classesof their countrymen continue as strained as at present.  Nationalism has, for  thetime being at any rate, established  complete dominance over  all that is vocal  andarticulate in Egypt.  From the Princes of the Sultan&apos;s  family down to the children of the primary schools, the men of property, the  professional men, the  religiousteachers, the literati, the journalists, the students and school-boys have all, more orless  willingly, been  swept  into the Nationalist movement.   Most serious of  all,perhaps, it now  permeates the official class and the upper  ranks  of  the army.Discipline and official decorum may prevent their sympathies finding open expression the attitude of Egyptian officials towards the Mission was always  courteous  andcorrect but in their hearts they are mostly strong Nationalists, and the  influenceradiating from them is all in the same direction.  It is  inconceivable that the senti-ment of their social superiors of every class, of all the men who make opinion, shouldnot in the long run profoundly affect the mass of the people.   No doubt Nationalismas a political creed has little attraction for these unlettered millions, though they can easily  be  taught  to repeat  its  catchwords.   But  then  it  is  not  so muchby  abstract  political  arguments  that  the  extremist  agitator  seeks   to  wintheir support,   as  by  the constant vilification  of everything  British  and  bysubtly attributing every local disaster and every personal grievance  to the malignityor incompetence of British officials.  This campaign of mendacious denigration iscarried  on  by many agencies, by preachers in the mosques, by country-bred studentsreturning for the holidays, by all but a few organs of the Arabic press.   It is truethat the fellah cannot, as a rule, read himself, but he can always be read to, and ifeverything that is spoken or written to influence him points the same way, the false-hoods so sedulously instilled cannot fail ultimately to poison his mind.     We make allowance for the fact that at the time of our visit anti-British clamourwas exceptionally intense.   It was no  doubt  artificially stimulated by the  more extreme section  in  order to impress us.    And no man of  any experience in suchmatters would mistake the extravagances of a political  agitation at fever pitch  forthe deliberate expression of the mind of a people.  But  it is a significant fact, that,while many Egyptians undoubtedly disapproved of the excesses of this agitation, noone, who was not compelled to do so by his official position,  made any effort to stemthem.   Men of standing, whatever their personal views, were much too  nervous of appearing  to be out of sympathy with national &quot; aspirations &quot;  to exercise  anymoderating or restraining influence.  No one would have dared to  say that he wasin favour of the  &quot; Protectorate,&quot; or that he was not in favour of &quot;complete indepen-dence.&quot;  To all outward appearance, independent opinion was solidly Nationalist.And in  our judgment it is likely to remain so.     The position is undoubtedly a serious one,  and in face of this solid phalanx of opposition  it might seem at first  sight as if we had no choice but either to abandonour position in Egypt altogether, or to maintain it by sheer force,  in the teeth of thegeneral  and ever-increasing hostility of the Egyptian people.  But a closer study of
                                      1.7the problem led us to take a more hopeful view.   From many and intimate con versa -tions with representative Egyptians, including some who  were commonly regardedas extreme Nationalists, the conviction was borne in upon  us, that they were not sointransigent, and certainly not so anti-British, as the frantic diatribes of the pressmight have led us to suppose.   The broad banner of Nationalism was seen  to covermany shades of opinion, and,  above all, most notable differences of temper and ofaim.&quot;  Undoubtedly there are a number of Nationalists whose fundamental hatredof all foreign, and especially all British, controlleads them to commit, or at  any ratesympathise with, acts of lawlessness and crime.  Not  only are  their  aims whollyincompatible with any sort of  understanding between British and Egyptians, butthey are prepared to pursue them by methods which nothing could justify and which no Government could do otherwise  than  strive to  repress.   They are deliberatelyencouraging a system of terrorism,  which is intended to render any co-operationbetween British and Egyptians impossible in the future.     The untoward  events of the last few  years in Egypt itself and the restless andrevolutionary spirit throughout the whole world, which has had a strong repercussionin that  country, have undoubtedly been grist  to the  mill of this extreme section andhave given a more sinister character to the Nationalist movement.  No wonder that,under these circumstances,  Nationalism has appeared to many British people on the spot, and perhaps to even more at home, to be synonymous with violent Anglophobiaand to be aiming at the complete subversion of the existing system of government inEgypt.               .             ,       .            -    .                &apos;     ,     But we  were satisfied,  even before leaving  Cairo, that  it would be a profoundmistake to take this sweeping view.  It would be wrong to allow the impressions ofa period of  turbulence, like the preceding twelve  months,  to blind us to what is reasonable and legitimate in the aspirations of Egyptian  Nationalism.   Such  anindiscriminating attitude could only tend to drive moderate men more and more intothe camp of the Extremists and to convert the present deplorable friction between British and Egyptians, which is not incapable of being remedied,  into bitter  andenduring hostility.  Violence and disorder must, of course, be suppressed, and here let us say that the measures taken to that end during our stay in Egypt were as temperate as they were effective.  The necessity  of continuing to maintain Martial Law inEgypt  is regrettable, but under Lord Allenby Martial Law was being administered with the minimum of severity  or of disturbance to  the normal course of justice and the  everyday life of the people.  The duty of promptly suppressing violence  and disorder must not, however, lead us to confound all those who are  in a greater or less degree  opposed to the existing system of  government  with the pronounced revolutionaries, or simple  criminals, who were responsible  for  the outbreak of the spring  of 1919 and the sporadic acts of violence which have been perpetrated since. In talking to many men who professed Nationalist opinions and  indeed  it  was difficult to find anyone who repudiated all sympathy with them we encountered a very different spirit  from  that which found  expression in such detestable  outrages. These men denounced the resort to violence, or open rebellion, as not only criminal, but useless.  Great Britain such was the general view was more than strong  enough to keep Egypt  in permanent subjection, if she preferred unwilling subjects to friendly and grateful allies. For they all recognised, with more or less warmth and spontaneity, the great benefits which Great Britain had conferred upon Egypt, while most of them also recognised that Egypt still stood in need of British assistance, not only in the work of internal reconstruction, but for her defence against foreign interference, and the danger of once more becoming the arena of international rivalry and intrigue.  They all, without exception, admitted  that Great Britain had a very special interest in Egypt, as the central link in her  communications with her Eastern Empire and the Australasian Dominions,  and a  perfect right to  safeguard  these  communications from any danger of interruption. But was  it necessary  for the fulfilment of these objects to deprive Egypt of her independence, to try to convert her  into an integral part of  the British  Empire,  and to run counter  to the ineradicable desire of the Egyptians to take  their place,  as  a distinct people, among the nations of the world ? Would not an orderly and friendly Egypt, in intimate association with Great Britain, serve British purposes as well, or even better,  while removing all sense of  grievance and all spirit of revolt on the Egyptian side 1  Moreover, was not such a consumma- tion the only, one consistent  with  the  avowed policy of  Great Britain, with  her reiterated declarations, that  it was not  her intention to appropriate Egypt,  or to incorporate her in the British Empire, but to make her capable of  standing on her own feet ?    In the sincerity of these declarations they had long believed, but were now ceasing to believe.  After nearly forty years of British occupation, they seemed.rr.!,,.r..T-r.-..,.T.,
to be not nearer to, but distinctly further from, the goal at which Great Britain hadprofessed to be aiming.  With our continued insistence on  the Protectorate, whichthey all  regarded as implying  the permanent subjection  of their country, GreatBritain had definitely departed from  her original  policy, and, in fact, broken herword.  They had accepted the Protectorate, when it was first declared, as a necessityof the moment.   Great Britain,  being at war with Turkey, had not  unreasonablysevered the remaining links between Turkey and Egypt, and something had immedi-ately to be substituted for the former Turkish suzerainty.  The Protectorate was thusjustified as a temporary expedient, but at the end of the war they had always expectedthat Great Britain would proceed to regulate her relations with Egypt in a mannermore consistent with her declarations,  with  her real interests, and with her  honour.Instead of that, they now saw nothing before them but the  permanent loss of theirnationality, of their existence as a people.  They were to become a &quot; British Colony,&quot;to be British subjects.  Against that they appealed, and would continue  to appeal,to the  British sense  of justice and in  the last resort to the sympathy of  the wholecivilised  world.                             (C.) Future Policy.    Such,  we believe, is a  fair statement  of the average opinion  of  EgyptianNationalists.  The violence, unfairness and unreason of the  more extreme  and noisysection have given to the whole movement an appearance of intransigeance which,  inour opinion, is not essential or necessarily enduring.  The remarkable organisationknown as the  Wafd (&quot;Delegation&quot;) which,  under the  leadership  of ZaghlnlPasha, has established, for the time being at least, so complete an ascendancy over theEgyptian public,  and claims, not  without many credentials, to speak in the name  of&quot;the nation/&apos; does not consist mainly of extreme  men.  Its members were drawnlargely from the ranks of  the old  Hisb  el  Umma, which, in contrast to the Hisbel Watani, the real  revolutionary  and anti-British party,  stood  for  gradual and constitutional progress.   It is true that in face of an attitude on our part which seemed to them to present  a  blank negative to all their hopes, Zaghlul and his associates have, until quite recently, been drifting steadily to the  left.   But in our experience, it only needed some effort to understand their point of view and to removetheir suspicions of the intentions of Great  Britain, in order  to  get  many of theZaghlulists to discuss the situation in  a perfectly reasonable spirit.  And the sameis naturally true of men of even more moderate views, like the ex-Ministers Eushdi,Adli and Sarwat Pashas, who, while sympathising with the ideals of  Nationalism,had never actually joined  the Wafd.  In such discussions,  when  once we had gotaway from phrases and formula? and come to grips with the practical  difficulties  ofthe problem, it soon became apparent that there were many  shades  and varieties  ofopinion among Egyptians.    The one  thing common to them all  was  the desire  to preserve  their nationality, their distinctive character as a people.    It is evident from what  has  been said that any effort at reconciliation between british and  Egyptians,  any  policy which  seriously attempts to  bring  the more moderate and friendly elements of Egyptian Nationalism once more on to our side,must take account of this deeply-rooted feeling.   No grant to Egypt of a greater  orless measure of &quot; self-government,&quot; even if  it went the  length of  what is  known  as&apos;! Dominion Home Rule,&quot; would meet the case, because Egyptians do not regard theircountry as a British  Dominion  or  themselves as  British  subjects.  This  whollydifferentiates the  problem  of constitutional development  in Egypt  from  the sameproblem  in countries which have for years indubitably  formed part of the  BritishEmpire, as, for instance, British India.  We talk of such countries gradually attaining the status of nationhood.   The Egyptians claim that they already have this status.No settlement of the future  of Egypt which does  not  recognise this claim is everlikely to be accepted by it can only be imposed on the Egyptian people.    As against these considerations, we have the patent fact that Egypt, though not actually a part of the British Empire, is of vital importance to our whole Imperialsystem, and that that country under British  guidance  has  attained a new  level  ofcivilisation, from which  it  would be disastrous to allow it to relapse.  To reconcile the defence of these interests Egyptian as well as British with  the recognition  ofthe national status of Egypt is no easy  matter.  And the problem seems, at first sight,to be further complicated, though on  a closer study it may turn out to be reallysimplified, by the exceptionally  strong position which  the  foreign  Colonies,  otherthan the British, occupy in Egypt.   In no other Eastern country  are there so manyresident  Europeans,  enjoying such special privileges or filling so many importantposts in commerce, in education, in the professions, in society  and even in the Govern-
 merit departments.   The great towns, especially Alexandria,  are to a large extent Europeanised, and  in a certain sense Egypt  will  always  remain  an international country.   No solution of the Egyptian problem can be enduring unless it provides for the security of the great  European interests, which are so strongly entrenched in the Nile  valley.  Thus that problem may well  appear as insoluble  as  it is certainty unique.  But then everything in and about Egypt always has been unique.   There are no precedents for us to  follow in dealing with conditions so abnormal.   Any system which really fits  these conditions  is bound to be novel,&apos; and it  should not be condemned as unsound merely because it looks  paradoxical.     In view of all these difficulties, we gradually came to the conclusion  that no settlement  could be satisfactory which was simply imposed by Great Britain upon Egypt, but that it would be wiser to seek a solution by means of a bilateral agree- ment a  Treaty between the two countries.  In no other way  did it appear  possible to release Egypt from the tutelage to which Egyptians so vehemently object,  without endangering  any of  the vital interests  which  we  are bound  to  safeguard.   All necessary safeguards, as it seemed to us, could be provided in  the terms of a Treaty of Alliance by which Egypt,  in return for Great Britain&apos;s undertaking to defend her integrity and  independence, would agree  to  be guided by Great Britain in  her foreign relations  and would at the same time confer  upon Great Britain certain definite rights in  Egyptian territory.  The rights we contemplated were of a two- fold character.  Firstly,  in order to protect her special interest in Egypt the safety of her  Imperial communications Great Britain  was to have  the right to maintain a military  force on  Egyptian soil;  and secondly, for the protection of all legitimate foreign  interests,  she was  to have  a certain measure  of control over  Egyptian legislation and administration, as  far  as they  affected  foreigners.   The former privilege was no  more than what Egypt could honourably concede to an ally who undertook  to defend her against  all external  dangers,  and whose  strength  and security  were  therefore  of  vital  importance  to  Egypt herself.   And the  latter privilege would involve no greater infringement of Egyptian independence than that to which, by virtue  of the Capitulations,^ Egypt has always been exposed.   Indeed, by substituting a single Power, Great Britain,  for the thirteen  foreign  Powers which have hitherto enjoyed capitulatory rights in Egypt,  it would tend to enlarge rather than to curtail  that independence.   Moreover, it was part of  our scheme, as it has always been  a feature of British policy in Egypt, to confine  the special privileges enjoyed by foreigners under the Capitulations within more reasonable limits, and by so doing  to make Egypt much more the mistress in her own house than she is to-day. But this  could only  be done if Egypt was prepared to recognise Great Britain as the protector of these foreign privileges when reduced to reasonable proportions.     This latter point requires a word of explanation.   The restrictions which the Capitulations impose upon  the sovereign rights of Egypt have a good as well as a    * &quot; Capitulations  &quot;  is the name given by Europeans to those concessions which secured from the early Sultans of Turkey extra-territorial rights to foreigners residing there, in continuation  of  similar privileges  granted to  foreign residents  by  the  Byzantine  Empire.  They  are  unilateral and non-terminable, but liable to modification by subsequent Treaties.  If, however,  these latter Treaties are terminable, the Capitulations  revive on  the expiration of such Treaties.  Primarily,  they were intended to make it possible for Christians to trade and reside in the territories of the Ottoman Empire by safeguarding them against  any forms of injustice or ill-usage, to which,  as foreigners of a different religion,  they might otherwise have been  subjected.  The Capitulations granted  to Great Britain by the Porte date back to a very early period, but after various alterations now  bear the date of  1675, and were confirmed in  the  Treaty of Peace concluded at the Dardanelles in  1809.   Capitulations were granted to France  in 1581, 1604  and 1673,  and  were renewed in 1740.  The Dutch were granted Capitulations in 1612; these were  renewed in 1680 and  still continue in force.  Nearly all  the other great Powers obtained  similar concessions from  the Porte at one time or another in the  course of the last 400 years.    It is in virtue of these  unilateral Treaties  with the Porte that Capitulations exist  in Egypt. The Powers enjoying them were, before the war, fifteen in number,  viz., Great Britain, United States of America, France, Italy,  Spain,  Holland, Belgium,  Norway,  Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary.  The privileges  of the two latter  were terminated&apos; in the recent Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.  In Egypt  the rights conferred on foreigners by the Capitulations,  apart from certain commercial concessions, included: immunity from personal taxation  without the assent  of their Governments; inviolability  of  domicile and  protection from arbitrary arrest; and exemption from the  jurisdiction of the local Courts.  Since the creation of the mixed Tribunals in 1876,  the  practical effects of the last-mentioned privilege are that no legislation applicable  to foreigners  can be enforced without the consent of the capitulatory Powers,  and  that civil  jurisdiction in  cases between Europeans  and natives or  between Europeans of differentnationality is exercised  by the  Mixed Courts,  while criminal  jurisdiction over  Europeans  and jurisdiction in civil cases  between Europeans of the same nationality is exercised by the ConsularCourts applying the laws of their own countries.   The only internal taxes to  which foreigners are at-present liable are the  house and land tax.
bad  side.  In so far as they protect  the  liberties and  property  of  foreigners byensuring them justice in the Courts and immunity from arbitrary action on the partof the local authorities, their operation is beneficent.  But, on  the other hand, byexempting foreigners from taxation and from the necessity of conforming to locallaws and regulations of an equitable kind, they constitute a great  and unjustifiablehindrance to the progress of the country.  For this reason it is, and always has been,the policy of Great Britain to get rid of the Capitulations and to substitute for thema system which, while protecting all legitimate foreign interests, would put an end to the indefensible privileges  which foreigners now enjoy.  Negotiations to securethat object have for  some time been going on between Great Britain  and the other powers who have capitulatory rights in Egypt.  But the Powers in question cannotbe expected to give up these rights unless they are assured that their nationals can rely  on obtaining justice and fair treatment in the future.   In order to be able togive them that assurance, Great Britain must be put into a position enabling her to implement it.   Thus it is in Egypfs own interest to empower Great Britain to actas the protector of such of the privileges now enjoyed by foreigners in  Egypt as it is just  and reasonable to maintain.  It is in this sense that the recognition in the recentPeace Treaties of Great Britain&apos;s special position in Egypt should be interpreted.     These, in broad outline and reserving details for later explanation, are the main features of the settlement by which we had come to think that the relations betweenGreat Britain and Egypt might in future be regulated.   And when we began todiscuss them with those Egyptians, all of more or less advanced Nationalist opinions,with whom we were in friendly contact, it was encouraging to find that our sugges-tions met with a large measure of sympathy.  No doubt  the idea of a Treaty, of asettlement arrived at  by agreement as between equals,  not by dictation from above,appealed strongly to  their  sense of being a distinct people, to  their  national self-respect.   For  evidently that  idea involved the  recognition,  in principle, of theindependence of Egypt and was inconsistent with the theory of  her being a Britishpossession.  And when they came  to consider the conditions which in our proposal were attached to this recognition, they were ready to admit that, however unaccept-able to extreme  Nationalists, these conditions were nevertheless such  as they couldthemselves justify to  their countrymen, as being compatible with  their status as a nation.  For that status could only be maintained in fact by  the support of GreatBritain and Great Britain was entitled  to a  reasonable  quid fro  quo for  thisindispensable  support.   That  she should  claim to control the foreign policy ofEgypt and  should have the right to maintain,  for her  own  Imperial purposes, a force on Egyptian soil, was no more  than such  a quid fro quo.   As regards herdomestic affairs, Egypt would  be completely self-governing  except  in respect ofthe privileges of foreigners. And the restrictions upon the full exercise of Egyptiansovereignty which the maintenance of some of these privileges involved were no greater but less, and far less irksome, than the restrictions which had always existed.In view of these practical  considerations, it could not be denied that the proposed arrangement was conceived in the interests, not only of Great Britain, but of Egypt,-and  could be defended as a fair and reasonable basis  for future co-operation.     The point of view  of  the Egyptians  of whom we are speaking can, of  course,only be stated in general terms.  There was much discussion between us, and muchdifference of opinion  among the Egyptians  themselves, about details.   Interminableand   wearisome  argumentation  about the meaning  of  words &quot; Protectorate,&quot;&quot;Sovereignty,&quot;  &quot;Independence,&quot;  and &quot;Complete  Independence&quot; occupied much time.  But it did not prevent a great deal of practical  consideration of the actualprovisions of the contemplated Treaty or indicate that agreement about them was inany  way impossible.   On the whole the conversations which we  had while in Egyptleft  on our minds the impression that we had made great  progress towards a goodunderstanding, and especially that we had got into a much better  atmosphere.  Thebitterness and suspicion, with which all Egyptian Nationalists had recently come to regard Great Britain, were beginning to disappear1, and there was a good prospectof gaining the support of  the more moderate section for a policy of  reconciliation.     But there was a distinct limit to anything which we could achieve, while still inEgypt, in the shape of definite results.  It was not within our competence to arrange a settlement of the Egyptian problem.  We could only advise as  to the best course tobe followed to that end.  And the Egyptians with whom we conversed, one and all,were emphatic  in stating that they were only expressing their individual opinions,and  that  they could  not claim  to  speak  for the great body  of their con vtrymen.Indeed, almost all of them went further, and referred us to Zaghlul Pasha and hisDelegation  as being the only men authorised by general acclamation to represent
the Egyptian people.  We ourselves, of course, could not admit that Zaghlul Pashaand his associates possessed the full measure of authority thus claimed for them,but neither could we blind ourselves to the fact that they were for the time beingthe most powerful leaders of Egyptian opinion, and that no scheme to which theywere definitely hostile stood any chance of favourable  consideration, much less ofgeneral acceptance.    But it was essential,  from our point of view, as we  had explained to the Egyptians from  the  first,  that the Treaty  which we contem-plated, if it was to have any real value, must be concluded in such a manner as tomake it not only  technically but morally binding upon Egypt.   As a matter of form,it  would be a Treaty between the  British and  Egyptian Governments.   But anagreement merely between Governments would not be sufficient.  It might always besaid afterwards that the Egyptian Government was not  a free agent, but was bound\o accept any terms that Great Britain chose to impose,  and that in any case it  was,jm autocratic Government, not really representing the Egyptian people.   For these reasons it had always been a fundamental point in our  plan that the Treaty shouldnot be allowed to come  into  force unless it had been approved  by a genuinelyvepresentative Egyptian  Assembly.   This might  be the  existing  LegislativeAssembly, the sittings of which have been suspended since the outbreak of war, orpreferably it might be a new body elected ad hoc.  It was rather for the Egyptiansihan for us to say what kind of Assembly would be in the truest sense representative.But  it must in  any case be a popularly elected body, deliberating with  perfectfreedom and taking its decision without official or other pressure of any kind.    In any such Assembly, we were assured on all hands, Zaghlul Pasha and his associates would command a  substantial, if  not  an overwhelming, majority.   Inthese circumstances it  appeared to us absurd to let any question of etiquette standin the way of our engaging in discussion with him, if he was willing to confer withas. Had we not from the outset invited representative Egyptians to lay their viewsoefore us, without prejudice on either side?  And, as  a matter of fact,  it seemed/likely at one time that Zaghlul Pasha, who was still in Paris,  would return to egypt in order to meet  the Mission.  Great efforts to induce him to do so were made by the egyptians, who  had been conferring with us, and some  of whom  were among hisstrongest adherents. Adli Pasha also, who, though himself occupying an indepen-dent position, was in friendly relations with Zaghlul, and was most anxious to effect a meeting between  him and us,  lent his  powerful influence to second  these efforts.But Zaghlul Pasha did  not as yet see his way to respond to these appeals  and,though numerous communications  passed between him and his friends  in Egyptduring the latter portion of our stay, he remained for the time being in Paris.    The position, therefore, at the time when we left Egypt was as follows: We had obtained,  from British and Egyptian sources,  a vast amount of information aboutexisting conditions; we had had ample opportunities of making ourselves acquainted with the state of public feeling; and we had formed our  own opinion as to  the policybest calculated to reconcile British and Egyptian interests.  But we were not yet ina  position to  say whether  the  scheme which we had in our minds, even if  itcommended itself to British  opinion, was likely to command sufficient support inEgypt to make it worth while to attempt a settlement on our lines.  All we could do,therefore, was to report on the situation as we had found  it,  to  indicate theconclusions to which our enquiries had led us, and to express the hope that  the better understanding between  British and  Egyptians, of which we saw some promisingsigns, would ultimately make it possible to determine the future status of Egypt by mutual agreement.                                     III.             PROCEEDINGS OF THE MISSION AFTER LEAVING EGYPT.             A. Discussions  with  Egyptian Delegates  in London.    We left Egypt at the end of the first week of March,  travelling by differentroutes, and met again in London about the middle of April, with the view of drawing up our Report.   But soon after we  had begun to do so,  a new and not whollyunexpected development of the situation caused us to interrupt our work, in the hopeof being able to obtain fuller information with regard to the capital point  on which,when leaving  Egypt, we had still  remained in doubt.  That point, as  already explained, was the attitude likely to be adopted by the chief exponents of Nationalistopinion towards the policy which we were ourselves disposed to advise the BritishGovernment to adopt.  A prospect, however, now presented itself of clearing up thispoint of doubt by the Mission coming into direct contact with Zaghlul Pasha.
     At the end of April  Adli Pasha, who commands the universal respect of his countrymen and whose advice had been of the greatest value to us in Egypt, paid a visit to Paris, and at once put himself into communication with Zaghlul Pasha with the object of bringing about a meeting between him and the Mission.  Early in May we became aware that, largely owing to Adli Pasha&apos;s good offices, Zaghlul Pasha and the Delegation were now disposed to abandon their  former attitude and enter into direct relations with the Mission.  Accordingly, during the third week in May, Mr. (now Sir Cecil) Hurst, who happened to be in Paris, conveyed to them an invita- tion to meet the Mission in London.  Zaghlul Pasha, having satisfied himself that by so doing he would not compromise his  position as the advocate of Egyptian independence,  arrived  in London on the  7th June,  tie was accompanied by ?even members of the Delegation, who were subsequently joined by one or two of their colleagues.     Then  followed a series of conversations which, with frequent interruptions, due to the fact that several of the members of the Mission were now busily engaged  in other work, lasted till the  middle of August.     These prolonged discussions took a variety of forms.  There were a number  of meetings at which the Mission,  as a body, met Zaghlul Pasha and his companions, Adli Pasha being  also present.  From time to time,  points which it was found difficult to discuss in so large a body were referred to committees consisting of a few members of either party, and these to some  extent cleared the ground.  Moreover, there was, in the interval between  formal meetings, a great deal  of useful private discussion  between individual  members  of the Mission  and one or  more of the Egyptians. It would serve no useful purpose to try and give an account of the many changing phases of this lengthy debate, but it is necessary to indicate its general character.     In the first place, we record with pleasure that very friendly relations were maintained from first  to  last,  and  that, even when differences  of opinion were sharpest, the controversy was always conducted in  an amicable spirit.   There was never any doubt in our  minds that our visitors were as sincerely anxious as we were ourselves to find a way out  of the difficulties of the situation.  But they were to some extent  hampered and this  is  specially  true  of Zaghlul  Pasha himself by the uncompromising line which they had taken in the recent past, when they believed that there was an unbridgeable gulf between Egyptian aspirations  and the policy of Great Britain.   They  had no doubt come to recognise  by this time that they had misunderstood  that policy, but it was not easy for them to readjust their position to suit their altered view of British intentions. Over and over again they declared that it was impossible for them  to accept some proposal or other made by us, the fairness of  which  they did  not  directly dispute, because  it  was inconsistent  with the &quot;mandate&quot; which they had received from the Egyptian people.   It was  useless to point out to them that the alleged &apos;&apos; mandate&apos;&apos; was really their  own programme, which the  Egyptian public had simply accepted from  them, and that  there was nothing to prevent their modifying a policy of their own creation.   The reply always was, that they  had no authority  to depart from claims which, even if originally put forward by themselves, had been enthusiastically endorsed by a great majority of their countrymen.  The war-cries  of the past eighteen  months  were,  indeed,  a perpetual stumbling-block,  and,  while in the course of our  discussions we were often very near agreement on points of substance, it was always difficult to clothe such agreement in words which did not conflict with formulae to which the Egyptians felt themselves  committed.     The idea  of a Treaty  between Great  Britain and Egypt was readily  accepted. That was our starting-point, and without it we should have made little progress. But when it came to discussing those terms of the Treaty which embodied the few, but  essential,  safeguards  for British and foreign interests,  the  Egyptians  were always  extremely apprehensive  of agreeing to something which might conflict with their ideal of independence. As a matter of fact, our proposals did not conflict with that ideal reasonably  interpreted as the Egyptians themselves,  or  at  any rate some of them,  were ready to admit.   But there was always the fear in their minds that their  countrymen  would not  take the  same view,  and that they Would  be regarded in Egypt as having; betrayed the national cause.    In  spite  of these  difficulties,  one  obstacle  after  another  was  gradually surmounted, and we finally succeeded in drafting the outlines of a settlement  withwhich both parties were more or less satisfied.  This result was only achieved byconsiderable concessions on the part of the Mission.   On one point  in particular,  to
 which we shall presently refer at greater length, we acquiesced in a claim on the part of the Egyptians which we were at first disposed to resist, because we were assured that the admission of that claim would do more than anything else to gratify popular sentiment in Egypt.  This concession seemed to us not too high a price to pay  if it secured the cordial  acceptance of the scheme as a whole by the Egyptian people. Moreover, we were bound to  recognise that the delegates also were ready to give up a good deal of what they had  originally demanded, in their anxiety to come to a good understanding with the Mission.     The compromise thus reached was one which commended itself to us on its merits subject to one essential condition.   That condition was that Zaghlul and his associated - ates would undertake to use all their influence to obtain  its acceptance by the people of egypt, and ultimately to get a Treaty giving effect to it approved by an Egyptian Popular Assembly.   This, as  it seemed to us, was no more than  we had a right to ask of them.  We could not, indeed, expect them to promise that their efforts would be successful, any more than we  could  ourselves  promise that our  advice would be approved by the British Government and the British people.  What we did demand was that  they should commit themselves  to supporting wholeheartedly the result of our joint efforts.  For unless they did this, it was too much to  hope that the settlement would be  rightly understood,  much less cordially welcomed, in Egypt.  Yet it would be idle for us, if we could  not cherish that hope,  to recommend it ourselves as a solution of the Egyptian problem.  The British  people,  we believed, would be quite willing to accord, very generous terms to Egypt,  but only if they were convinced that those terms would be gratefully accepted and would lead to permanently improved relations and hearty co-operation between them and the Egyptians in the future.     Zaghlul Pasha and his friends  were, however, not yet prepared to commit them- selves to this  extent.  They  were evidently still  nervous of being repudiated  by a considerable number of their  followers in Egypt,  They accordingly kept on suggest- ing further modifications of  the terms so far agreed to, mainly on points of form, with the view of making them more  acceptable to Egyptian opinion.  But we had now gone as far as we deemed wise  in the way of concession.  For we, too^ as we did not fail to point out, had to reckon with public opinion, and it was no use to agree to anything, with a view of pleasing the Egyptians, which would lead to the rejection of the whole  scheme in Great Britain.   We seemed, therefore, after all, to  have reached an impasse.                    B.-The Memorandum of August 18, 1920.    At this stage, however, it was suggested on the Egyptian side that the discussion should be  temporarily suspended, in order that some members  of the Delegation might have  time to visit Egypt,  to explain to the public of that country the nature of the settlement which the Mission was disposed to recommend, and  the great advantages which Egypt would derive from it.  If, as they hoped,  they met with a favourable reception, this would constitute a &quot;  mandate &quot; from the people which would justify the Delegation, on the return of the emissaries, in pledging itself to give our proposals an unconditional support.  Zaghlul Pasha  himself was not disposed to undertake the journey, but he approved of the idea, and three or four  of his companions  were willing to go.    This  proposal had obvious advantages from  the Egyptian point of view.   For it would enable the emissaries to advocate the acceptance of certain terms  without being absolutely committed to them, and thus running the risk  of finding themselves isolated from the bulk of their  party  in case those terms met with an unfavourable reception.  But it had advantages for us also, inasmuch as the  general public  dis- cussion, which was bound! to ensue, would enable us to gauge  Egyptian opinion more completely than had yet been possible, and to judge of the comparative strength of moderate  and  extreme  Nationalists.  A memorandum was accordingly drawn up  the last of a series of efforts to reduce the result of our discussions to a definite shape which laid down  in general terms the main features of the settlement, which, onthe condition already specified, the Mission  would be disposed to recommend.  Theobject of the memorandum was to enable the emissaries to  elicit an expression of egyptian  public opinion.  This document, which presently came to be known as the &quot; Milner-Zaghlul Agreement,&quot; but which, on the face of it,  was not an agreement,but merely an outline  of the bases  on which an  agreement  might subsequently be framed, was handed by Lord Milner  to Adli Pasha, who, as an intermediary betweenthe two parties, had had a large share in all our negotiations, to be communicated by
him to Zaghlul Pasha and his friends.  It was understood that they might make freeuse of it in public discussion in Egypt.  It was dated the 18th August and was inthe following terms :      &quot; The accompanying memorandum is the  result of conversations held in london in June to August 1920 between Lord Milner and the members of the Special mission to Egypt, and  Zaghlul Pasha and the members of the Egyptian Delegation, in whichconversations Adli Pasha  also took.part.  It  outlines a policy for the settlement ofthe Egyptian question in.  the best interests both of Great Britain and  Egypt.    &quot; The members of the Mission are prepared to recommend the British Governmentto adopt the policy indicated in the memorandum, if they are satisfied that ZaghlulPasha and the Delegation  are likewise prepared to advocate it, and will use all thedrinfluence to obtain the assent of an Egyptian National Assembly to the conclusion ofsuch a Treaty  as is contemplated in Articles 3 and 4.    &quot; It is clear  that unless both parties are cordially united in supporting  it, thepolicy here suggested  cannot be pursued with  success.                                                    (Signed)       MILNER.                                Memorandum.    &quot;1.  In order to establish the independence of Egypt on a secure and  lasting basis,it is necessary that  the  relations between Great Britain  and Egypt should  be precisely defined,  and the privileges and immunities now enjoyed in Egypt by thecapitulatory Powers should  be modified and rendered less injurious to  the interestsof the country.    &quot; 2. These ends  cannot be achieved without  further  negotiations  betweenaccredited representatives of the British and  Egyptian Governments respectivelyin the one  case,  and bet wen the British Government and the Governments of thecapitulatory Powers in the other case.   Such negotiations will be directed to arriving at definite agreements on the following lines:     &quot; 3. (i.)  As between Egypt and Great Britain a Treaty will be entered into,          under  which  Great Britain will recognise the independence of  Egypt as          a constitutional  monarchy with representative institutions, and  Egypt          will confer upon  Great Britain such  rights as are necessary  to safeguard          her special interests and to enable her  to furnish the  guarantees  which          must  be  given  to foreign Powers  to secure the  relinquishment of their          capitulatory  rights.    (ii.) By the  same Treaty,  an alliance will be concluded between Great Britain          and Egypt, by which Great Britain  will undertake to  support  Egypt in          defending  the  integrity  of her territory,  and Egypt will undertake, in          case of war, even when the integrity of Egypt is not affected, to  render to          Great  Britain  all the  assistance in her power, within her own borders,          including the use of her harbours, aerodromes and means of communica-          tion for military purposes.    &quot; 4. This Treaty will embody stipulations to the following effect:     (i.) Egypt will enjoy the right to representation in foreign countries.  In the          absence of any duly-accredited Egyptian representative, the  Egyptian          Government  will confide its interests  to the  care   of  the British          representative.   Egypt will undertake not to adopt in foreign  countries          an  attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or will create difficul-          ties for  Great Britain,  and will  also undertake not to enter  into any          agreement with a foreign Power which is prejudicial to British  interests.    (ii.) Egypt will confer on Great Britain  the right to maintain a military force          on  Egyptian soil for  the  protection of her Imperial  communications.          The Treaty will fix the place where the  force shall be quartered and will          regulate any subsidiary  matters  which require to be arranged.  &quot;The          presence of  this  force shall not constitute in any manner  a  military          occupation of the country, or prejudice the rights of the Government of          Egypt.    (iii.) Egypt  will appoint,  in concurrence  with  His Majesty&apos;s Government, a          Financial Adviser,  to whom  shall  be entrusted in due course the  powers          at present exercised by the Commissioners of the Debt, and who will be          at the disposal of the Egyptian Government for all other matters on which          they may desire to consult him.
     (iv.)  Egypt will appoint,  in concurrence with His Majesty&apos;s Government,  ani           official in the Ministry of Justice, who shall enjoy the right of access to           the&apos; Minister.  He shall be kept fully informed on all matters connected           with the administration of the law as affecting foreigners, and will also           be at the disposal of the Egyptian Government for consultation on any           matter connected with the efficient maintenance of law and order.     (v.) In view of the contemplated transfer to His Majesty&apos;s Government of the           rights  hitherto exercised  under the  regime of tire Capitulations by the           various  foreign  Governments,  Egypt  recognises the  right  of Great           Britain fo intervene, through her representative in Egypt, to prevent the           application  to  foreigners of  any Egyptian law now requiring foreign           consent,  and Great Britain on her side undertakes not to exercise this           right except in the case of laws operating  inequitably  against foreigners.&quot; Alternative:      In view of the contemplated transfer to His Majesty&apos;s Government of the rights           hitherto  exercised under the regime of the Capitulations by the various           foreign Governments, Egypt  recognises the right of  Great Britain to           intervene, through  her  representative in  Egypt, to prevent the appli-           cation to foreigners of any Egyptian law now requiring foreign consent,           and  Great Britain on her  side  undertakes not to  exercise this right           except in the case of laws inequitably discriminating against foreigners           in the matter of taxation, or inconsistent with the principles of legislation           common to all the capitulatory Powers.     (vi.)  On account of  the special relations between Great Britain and Egypt           created by the Alliance,  the British representative will be accorded  an           exceptional position in Egypt and will be entitled to precedence over  all           other representatives.     (vii.) The engagements of  British and other foreign officers and administrative           officials who entered into the service of the Egyptian Government before           the  coming into force of the Treaty may  be terminated, at the  instance           of either the officials themselves or the Egyptian Government, at any           time within two  years after the coming into force of the Treaty.   The           pension or compensation to be accorded to officials retiring under this           provision, in addition to that provided  by the  existing law,  shall  be           determined by the Treaty.   In cases where no advantage is taken of this           arrangement existing terms  of service will remain unaffected.     &quot; 5.  This Treaty will be submitted to the approval of a Constituent Assembly,but it will not come into force until after the agreements with  foreign Powers forthe closing  of their Consular Courts and the decrees  for the reorganisation of the mixed Tribunals have come  into operation.     &quot; 6. This Constituent Assembly will also be charged with the duty of  framinga new Organic Statute, in accordance with the provisions of which the Governmentof Egypt will in future be conducted.   This Statute will embody provisions for theMinisters being responsible  to  the Legislature.   It will also provide for religioustoleration for all persons and for the due protection of the rights of foreigners.     &quot;7.  The necessary modifications  in the regime  of  the Capitulations will  besecured by agreements to be concluded by Great Britain with the various capitulatoryPowers.  These agreements will provide for the closing of the foreign  ConsularCourts, so as to render possible the reorganisation and extension  of the jurisdiction of the  Mixed  Tribunals and  the  application  to all foreigners  in Egypt of  thelegislation  (including  legislation  imposing  taxation) enacted  by  the  EgyptianLegislature.     &apos;: 8. These agreements will provide for the transfer to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof the rights previously exercised  under  the regime of the Capitulations by  thevarious foreign  Governments.  They will also contain stipulations to the following effect:      (a.) No attempt will be  made to  discriminate against the nationals of a Power           which agrees to close its Consular  Courts,  and such nationals shall enjoy           in Egypt the same treatment as British subjects.     (b.) The Egyptian Nationality Law will be founded on the jus sanguinis, so that           the  children born in Egypt  of  a foreigner will enjoy the nationality ofI&apos;          their father, and  will not be claimed as Egyptian subjects.
     (c.) Consular officers of the foreign Powers shall be accorded by Egypt the same           status as foreign Consuls enjoy in England.     (d.) Existing Treaties and Conventions to which  Egypt is a  party  on matters           of  commerce  and   navigation,  including  postal  and  telegraphic           Conventions, will remain in  force.  Pending the conclusion of special           agreements  to which she is a party, Egypt will apply the Treaties  in           force  between  Great  Britain and  the foreign Power  concerned on           questions affected by, the closing of the Consular Courts, such as extra -           dition Treaties, Treaties for  the surrender of seamen  deserters, &amp;c,  as           also Treaties of a political nature, whether multilateral or bilateral, e.g.,           arbitration  Conventions and  the various Conventions relating to the           conduct of hostilities.     (e.)  The liberty to  maintain schools and to teach  the language of the foreign           country concerned will be  guaranteed,  provided that  such schools are           subject  in all respects to  the laws  applicable  generally to European           schools in Egypt.     (/.)  The liberty to  maintain or organise religious and charitable foundations,           such as hospitals,  &amp;c, will also be guaranteed.     &quot; The  Treaties will also provide for  the necessary  changes in the Commissionof the Debt  and  the  elimination  of the  international  element in the  AlexandriaBoard of Health.     &quot;9.  The legislation rendered necessary by  the aforesaid  agreements betweenGreat Britain and the foreign Powers, will be effected by decrees to be issued by theEgyptian Government.     &quot;A decree shall be enacted at the same time validating all measures, legislative,administrative or judicial, taken under Martial Law.     &quot; 10. The decrees for the reorganisation of the  Mixed Tribunals will provide forconferring  upon  these Tribunals all jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the  foreignConsular Courts,  while leaving the jurisdiction of the Native Courts untouched.     &quot;11. After the coming into force of the Treaty referred to in Article  3, GreatBritain  will communicate  its  terms to  foreign  Powers and will support anapplication by Egypt for admission as a member of the League of Nations.     &quot; August 18, 1920.&quot;                      C. The Policy of the Memorandum.                1. Representation of Egypt in Foreign Countries.     The policy of the above document in its general character is in accordance withthe  conclusions  at which, for the reasons  already  given, we had  arrived  before leaving Egypt.  But, as  a  result of our discussions with Zaghlul  Pasha and his associates, we were now prepared  to go somewhat further.  The most important pointon which we were led by their arguments to  modify our earlier view  is one to whichthe memorandum gives especial prominence, viz., the right of Egypt to appoint her own representatives in foreign countries.  It has always been, and is,  from our pointof view,  a fundamental principle  that the foreign relations of Egypt should be underthe general direction of Great Britain.  All reasonable Egyptians, however stronglyNationalist,  recognise the immense value of the  security which  an alliance withGreat Britain  would afford them.  But it  is obviously impossible  to  expect thatGreat Britian  should shoulder the responsibility of defending  the integrity and independence of Egypt against  all possible dangers, if that country were  free to pursue a policy  of her own in foreign affairs inconsistent with or prejudicial to thepolicy of Great Britain.  This axiom none  of the Egyptians with  whom we weredealing ever attempted  to  dispute.  They were  quite prepared-in a Treaty  of alliance-to give whatever  pledges might be necessary to exclude the possibility ofany action on the part of Egypt which could cause embarrassment to her great ally.There was,   indeed,  no difference of opinion on  this point  in the  course  of our discussions,  and the words of the  memorandum dealing with it appear to us to makethe  complete understanding which existed  with regard to the subject  sufficiently clear.  For  in this, as in other respects, it  must always be borne in mind,  that  indrawing up  the memorandum, we were not attempting to draft a Treaty but  simply to express in ordinary  language the ideas which  a Treaty, to be subsequently
negotiated, would express with much more detail and in terms of greater precision.    The real issue here was not whether Egypt should be free to follow a  foreignpolicy independent of Great Britain the impossibility of our assenting to this wasnot disputed but whether this principle necessarily involved the  conduct of all herforeign relations  remaining in British hands.    This was a question upon which we had already, before discussing it with the egyptians at all,  come to a very definite conclusion.  In our opinion British control should be limited to  Egypt&apos;s political relations.  Egyptian  commercial or other interests of a non-political character in foreign countries had  better be  left inEgyptian hands.  These interests are numerous and growing.  The development ofcommerce and communications, the rapidly increasing number of Egyptians who now travel or reside  abroad, especially in Western Europe, and the  multifariousconnections which they form there constitute a need for a certain amount of officialprotection.  If the duty of looking  after all Egyptian private interests abroad is tocontinue to  fall upon British diplomatic and consular agents, it will become an excessive burden.   And the inevitable failure to discharge that duty to the satisfac-tion of the Egyptians will be a constant source of grievance.   For these reasons it seemed to us from the first to be eminently desirable that Egypt should appoint representatives of her own in foreign countries.    But what we originally contemplated was that these Egyptian representatives should have  only consular and not diplomatic  status.   It was on this point  thatduring  our  discussions in London we came, not  without hesitation, to  adopt adifferent view.  The Egyptians were all absolutely unanimous  in maintaining thatthe denial of diplomatic status to the representatives of Egypt vitiated the idea ofan  Alliance and  would  make  the  settlement  we  were contemplating   entirelyunacceptable to their countrymen.   And in  this assertion we believed them to bejustified.  For, even while in Egypt, we had realised that all Egyptians, includingthe Sultan and his Ministers, however much they were divided on other questions,were united in their desire for the diplomatic representation of their country abroad.It was a sore point with all of them that, when declaring the Protectorate, we haddispensed with an Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs and placed the egyptian foreing  Office, with  which it was found impossible to  dispense,  under the HighCommissioner.  The hope was universal that, when the time came to put the relations of Great Britain and Egypt on a permanent footing, we should allow the Ministry forForeign Affairs once more to have an Egyptian chief and foreign representatives, as of old, to be directly  accredited to the ruler of Egypt.  And on the same principle itwas hoped that,  now that Turkish suzerainty  had disappeared, Egyptian repre-sentatives in those foreign countries  to which it might  be necessary to send them would enjoy a similar status to that of foreign representatives in Egypt.    In this matter, therefore, we could have no doubt that the Egyptian delegates were  speaking for all their countrymen.   And  indeed they were most emphatic indeclaring that, unless we could meet them on this point, there was no prospect of settling the future relations between Great Britain  and Egypt  by the method ofagreement.  On the  other hand this recognition of the status of Egypt would, asthey  affirmed, be so  great  a satisfaction to national pride that it would  make theacceptance of all  our  other conditions easy.  And what, they asked, were we afraid of ?   We recognised that Egypt had many,interests of her own in foreign countries,which could best  be looked after by Egyptians.   There was no advantage to GreatBritain in withholding from the men entrusted with the care of  those interests thedignity of  diplomatic status.  For they could not take any action injurious toBritish interests  or  conflicting with  British policy, without breaking the Treaty,which, as had already been agreed  between us, was to be so drafted as to preclude the possibility of  such  action.    Moreover,  the number  of  Egypt&apos;s diplomatic representatives abroad would be very limited.  Egypt did not desire, and could not afford, to have such  representatives in more than a few  countries.  The fact  thateverywhere else Egyptian  interests  would be entrusted to  the care of Great Britainmarked the  specially  intimate character of the relations between the two countries.    We  could not but feel that these were weighty  considerations.  At  the sametime  it was evident, as  we  strongly  insisted,  that  the presence of Egyptiandiplomatists, even in a few European capitals, and of foreign diplomatists in Cairo,would afford opportunities for intrigue, which might lead to much trouble.  The veryfact that these diplomatists would,  in the  political sphere, have really nothing to domight tempt them to justify their existence by transgressing their proper functions.But the delegates would not admit that there was any real  danger of this happening,
 Their view  was that,  satisfied with  the  position  acquired  by  Egypt under the Treaty, the Egyptians would be the last to favour  intrigues, which might give other foreign nations an opportunity of interfering in their country by  first making mischief between them and Great Britain.  The greatest safeguard which we could have against such machinations was the fact that the Egyptians themselves would be whole-heartedly in favour of an Alliance which fully recognised their national status and dignity.    Such were the arguments which led us to reconsider our position on  the question of diplomatic status.  In so doing we were well aware, and we frankly told the dele- gates, that this was a concession which might alarm  public opinion in  this country and imperil the acceptance of the agreement as a whole by the British people.  And, judging  from the unfavourable  comments which this proposal has already excited in many quarters, it is evident  that we were not mistaken in anticipating that it would meet with serious opposition.   Nevertheless, we  remain of opinion that the balance of argument is decisively in its favour.  So long as bitterness and friction continue to exist between Great Britain and Egypt, we shall always be  exposed to the hostility  of Egyptians in foreign countries.  Associations  for the purpose of anti- British propaganda have been actively at work for a number of years in Switzerland, France, Germany and Italy. There is no remedy for this, except in restoring friendly relations and we rely on  the whole policy here proposed to  have this effect.  If that result is  achieved  there  will,  in our opinion, be positive  advantages in giving diplomatic status  to  Egyptian representatives  abroad.   For if,  as  is  only to  beexpected, a certain number of irreconcilables  are still  left to carry on the campaign against  Great Britain, the official representatives of Egypt will be bound to  try to restrain them.  No Egyptian  Minister could do otherwise than discountenanceactivities on the part of his own countrymen, directed against Egypt&apos;s ally, withoutfailing in his duty and rendering himself liable to be recalled.     The supreme importance which the delegates attached to the question of nationalstatus was once more strongly in evidence when we came to deal with Great Britain&apos;sstrategic interest in Egypt the protection of her Imperial communications.  ToGreat Britain as an ally they thought that Egypt could, without indignity, accorda base in Egyptian territory, &quot;a strong  place of arms,&quot; a point oVappui in the chain of her Imperial defences, linking East and West.   They were not averse from the idea that Great Britain, in  case of war, should have the command of Egyptian resources,and especially of all means  of  communication,  railways, aerodromes,  &amp;c, for theconduct of military operations.  Such a stipulation was even welcome as emphasising the &quot; bilateral &quot; character of the agreement between the  two countries,  inasmuch asEgypt would be giving something in exchange for what she  got.   As by a Treaty of alliance, Great Britain would be undertaking to defend Egypt, it was only fair that egypt should do something to assist the British Empire, if Great Britain was engagedin a war, even a&apos;war in which Egypt was not directly interested.     A more difficult  point was the maintenance of a British military force in egypt in time of peace.  But here  again it was not so  much the numbers of  the force inquestion which interested the Egyptians  as its character.  As long as it was not there as an &quot; Army of Occupation,&quot; as a force intended to  &quot; keep order &quot; in Egypt, whichwas merely another way of saying to keep Egypt in subjection, but was maintained for an external object,  the defence of the British Empire, the presence of a british force in Egypt was justifiable from their point of view.  The question of the strengthof that force was never raised in the course of the discussion. It was recognised thatthis depended on external  conditions and, apart from what would be necessary ifEgypt was herself in danger, might vary with the varying exigencies  of Imperialdefence.  The great&apos; point  was, that it should  not  be regarded  in  any sense as agarrison of Egypt.   The  maintenance of  internal  order  was  a matter for  the     In order to emphasise this aspect of the case the delegates urged very strongly,that the  force in question should be stationed on the bank of the  Suez Canal andpreferably on its eastern side.  But to this  it was quite impossible for  us to agree.For, in the first place, the presence of British troops in the neutral &quot; canal zone &quot;would be calculated to raise trouble with other Powers interested in that internationalwaterway. The neutrality of the canal is guaranteed by international agreements and the permanent occupation of the canal zone by troops of any single Power mightbe challenged as  a  breach of that neutrality.  Moreover,  Great Britain&apos;s strategic2.  The Defence of Imperial Communications.
 interest in Egypt is not limited to securing a free passage through the Suez Canal. &quot;The  defence of her  Imperial  communications&quot; involves much more than that. For Egypt is becoming more and  more a &quot;nodal point&quot; in the complex of those communications by land and air  as well as by sea. In face of these considerations, the idea of fixing Kantara, or some other spot in the canal  zone, as the site of a cantonment had to be abandoned and, the principle of the maintenance of a British military force in Egypt having been admitted,. the question where that force should be stationed was left open to be settled, with other  details, in the official negotia- tions for the conclusion of the contemplated  Treaty.                 3.  The British  Officials in  the Egyptian Service.     The seventh clause of  Article IV of the memorandum deal with the position of British officials in the Egyptian service.  This is a matter of supreme importance to the good government of Egypt.  The whole system of internal administration as it exists to-day, has been mainly built up by the work and example of British officials, many of whom have spent the best part of their lives in the country.  The immediate elimination of the British element would bring the whole fabric down in ruins.  Even an over-hasty reduction of  that  element would  threaten its stability, and greatly impair the efficient conduct  of public business.     It  is not indeed to be feared that,  with the retirement of the British officials, the country would relapse into the state of maladministration, from which we have delivered it, and that  all the  old  evils would return.  The number of Egyptians qualified by education  and  character to take part  in the work of government on civilised principles has greatly increased since the occupation.  All the Egyptians, even the humblest, have become so habituated to the new standard of orderly, equitable- able and honest administration, that a complete return to the abuses of the past would not be  tolerated.  Nevertheless,  the &quot;new model&quot;  would certainly be exposed to danger of serious deterioration, if the men who have built it up and are still its main- stay were to be suddenly withdrawn.     Thus it is only natural that the proposal  to leave a purely Egyptian Government entirely free to retain or not to retain British or other foreign officials in the Civil Service  should be  at first  sight regarded   with  considerable uneasiness.   But - a calm  consideration  of  the  practical  aspects of  the  case  is calculated  greatly to  allay these  misgivings.   The  idea of  any  Egyptian  Government, however free to  do  so, attempting to make  a clean  sweep of  its  foreign  officials  is  a chimera.    One has  only to picture the plight of such a Government, suddenly deprived of its most experienced and responsible advisers and confronted with the general unpopularity which the consequent administrative breakdown  would entail, to  realise that no sane men would deliberately plunge  into such a sea of trouble. And it  is not only Egyptian disapproval which would have to  be reckoned with,  but the anger and alarm of  the foreign residents.   The  large  and wealthy  foreign Colonies, on which the economic welfare of Egypt so greatly depends, would at once be up in arms.   For these have all come to regard the presence of a British nucleus in the administration as the sheet-anchor of their  own safety  and prosperity.   Nor is it to  be anticipated that the  High Commissioner or whatever the British repre- sentative may in future be called would not have a word to say in thie matter.  True, he will, ex hypothesi, have no right to dictate to the Egyptian Government.  But as the representative of Egypt&apos;s  ally,  as  the foremost  foreigner in Egypt, and  the guardian of foreign interests, he  will still carry great weight,  and it will  always be a matter of interest to  Egyptian Ministers to be on good terms with him.    The influences which would  militate against the abuse by these Ministers of the right to dispense with the services of British officials are thus immensely strong.  And at the same time the great satisfaction which they would feel at knowing that they had that right, and  that the British officials were really there to  assist and not to dictate, would make them more and and not less ready to rely on British help.    For no  sensible Egyptian seriously wisbes to  dispense with foreign aid in  the government of his country, or believes that Egypt could, for a long time to come at any rate, afford to do without it.  Egyptians  generally no  doubt think,  and they  areright in thinking, that the importation of British officials has sometimes,  especially of late years, been overdone.  They hold firmly to the  principle that no Englishmanor other foreigner should be appointed to any post for  which a  reasonably competentman of their own race can be found.   They look forward to the time when  the wholeor almost the whole of the public  service will be staffed by their fellow-countrymen.They feel that progress  in that direction has been unduly slow  and would like to  see
 it sensibly  accelerated.   But  they certainly do not wish to get rid of those British officials-and there are a goodly number of them-whom they really respect, or to be precluded from engaging others of equal competence in the service of their country in the  future.*      The danger lies  rather in the opposite direction.   There may be a stampede of British  and other foreign officials, scared by  the prospect of finding themselves at the mercy of a purely Egyptian  Government.   That would  be a grave  misfortune, but it seems to us very improbable that such an exodus  will ever   assume  large dimensions.  In the  first place, there are in many  branches  of the Public  Service, such as ports, railways, customs, public works, &amp;c, a considerable number of English- men and other  Europeans, who are  employed as experts for lack   of Egyptians possessing  the  necessary technical  skill.   These men  are not likely   to  feel  their position in any way affected  by a change in  the political status of Egypt.    It is rather those occupying  genuinely administrative posts,  and  having  authority over large bodies of Egyptians, who  are  likely  to fear this  change.    Will  Egyptian Ministers,  they may ask  themselves, still  support  them in the exercise  of that authority?   Will  it  still be  possible to carry on  the perpetual struggle  against corruption  and nepotism, and for  promotion by merit and not by influence, with any measure of success ?   Such fears are  not unnatural, and they may lead some of the men in  question to  prefer retirement.   But there are others who  will  feel more confidence in themselves and in the essential strength of their future position.   For they will not be, like the handful of  Europeans who, before the occupation, fought an uphill battle for decent administration  in an unreformed  Egypt, and even under those depressing conditions were not  without  influence and certainly  were  not treated with  any  personal disregard.  The British officials who remain  in Egypt to-day will be in a country which is  permeated by European influences, which has now grown  used to British methods of government and  which  will remain in contact on its borders with concrete evidences of British power.   Moreover, the  recognition of Egyptian independence will remove one  great obstacle to their present usefulness. The growing prejudice against imported officials, which threatens, if unchecked, to put an end to all hearty co-operation between them and their Egyptian fellows, is    *We took considerable pains to  discover the truth about  the number of foreign officials in the Egyptian  Service.  Returns were prepared for us  by the Statistical Department,  showing th^ distribution of all posts in the 1919-1920  Budget, while  a comparative statement was called for from each Ministry, showing the distribution  of pensionable  and contract posts in the years 1905,  1910, 1914 and 1920.    In the returns submitted by the Statistical Department, posts are described as &quot;  pensionable,&quot; &quot; contract,&quot; &quot; monthly paid&quot;  and  &quot; daily  paid.&quot;   In the two latter classes 98A  per cent,  of the posts are occupied by Egyptians.  So in  this category foreign competition is evidently not excessive.    An examination of the pensionable  and contract posts,  however, revealed a different state, of affairs.  Omitting  the seven ministerial posts, the staff of  the  Sultan&apos;s Cabinet, the Council of Ministers,  the Legislative  Assembly and the Ministry of  Wakfs, in  which, with one or two exceptions, the posts  are held exclusively  by  Egyptians, Egyptians hold 86 per  cent, of the  posts in the administration and draw 71 per cent, of  the salaries,  while the British hold 6 per cent, of the posts and draw 19 per cent,  of the salaries, others (viz., non-Egyptian and non-British) holding 8 per cent. of the  posts and drawing 10  per cent,  of the salaries.  In some statistical diagrams which were prepared to show the distribution of these posts and salaries among the different Ministries, the posts are divided into six classes.  The first three classes  range from the  lowest salaries to   E. 799 per annum,  and may be described as &quot;Lower Posts;&quot; the other three classes cover &quot;Higher Posts,&quot; and include salaries of  E.800 to  E.  2,999.    Among the lower  posts,  Egyptians  hold  roughly  two-thirds of those between   E.240 and  E. 499; but after that the Egyptian share declines to little more than one-third of the posts between   E. 500 and    E.  799.  In the higher posts the disparity is even more marked and  the Egyptian share does not amount to one-quarter.  It is true that in the   E. l,200-  E. 1,499 class, the Egyptian share rises to  over one-third,  but this can be traced to  the Ministries of Interior and Justice, which provide Egyptian Mndirs  (Provincial Governors) and Judges.  In  the higher posts  of the Ministries of Finance, Education, Public Works, Agriculture and Communications, however, there  are  only 31 Egyptians, as  against  168 British  and 32 &quot; others &quot; holding posts over  E. 800.  Doubtless in these  particular Ministries there are many  higher posts  requiring  special technical  qualifications which it is impossible at the moment to find Egyptians qualified to fill.  If, however, Egyptians are to  be  responsible  for  the internal administration of their country, it  is essential that better provision should be made for training them to occupy such higher posts.    As far as the  comparative  tables showing the  distribution of  pensionable and contract posts in 1905, 1910, 1914 and 1920 are concerned, owing to  the imperfect state of the records the figures can only be regarded as approximate. They sufficed, however, to give a general impression of the turnoverin personnel.  In the total of posts the Egyptian element has  grown from 454 per cent, in 1905 to50-5 per cent,  in 1920.  Egyptians in lower posts have also increased from 48-4 per cent, of the total in 1905 to 55 per cent in 1920.  But in the higher posts their number has declined from 27-7 per cent.in 1905 to only 23-1 per  cent,  in 1920,  while in the same category  the British share of posts hasincreased from&apos;42-2 per cent, to 59-3 per cent, of the total.
 not due to the men but to the system.   It is because they are, or can be represented to be, imposed upon Egypt against her will,  as  the agents and symbols of foreign domination, that hostility to them is easily excited.  The grounds for such hostility will disappear  when they can no longer be regarded as instruments of a foreign government, and  their efforts to maintain  efficiency will then  have an  increased amount of native support.   For, as individuals, British  administrators and the British officers in  the Egyptian army are not unpopular.  The best of them not only command  the respect,  but  win the affection,  of a people who  are very quick to recognise  capacity,  especially when it is combined  with graciousness  and  tact Given time for reflection-and it is certain that nothing will be done in a hurry n is likely that these considerations will determine many Englishmen in the  Egyptian service to stick to their posts.    And indeed Englishmen could  perform no more honourable service than in establishing a friendly partnership between Great Britain and Egypt and assisting Egyptians to make a success of self-governing institutions.     But while any general or rapid displacement  of the British and  other foreign officials is not to be anticipated, it is nevertheless desirable to make careful  provision for those, with whose services the Egyptian Government may wish to dispense or who may themselves wish to retire, when the  new system comes  into force.   Such men must be treated not only with fairness^ but with generosity.  For nothing could have a worse effect upon  Anglo-Egyptian relations in the future than that a number of former officials  should  be left  with  a sense  of  grievance.  In any Treaty between Great Britain and Egypt their position will have to be absolutely safeguarded, and the conditions of retirement carefully laid down after consultation with representa- tives of those concerned.  Under the existing law Egyptian officials,  who are retired by the Government  for reasons  other than  misconduct,  receive  pensions  on  a not ungenerous scale proportionate to their length of service.  No new arrangement can infringe existing rights.  But it is evidently necessary, in view of the altered circum- stances,  to make special provision for those whose careers may be prematurely cut short.   And it is  quite essential  that men who under the new system retire of their own accord, should receive the  same  favourable  treatment  as  those with whose services the Egyptian Government may choose to dispense.  In ordinary circumstances a man voluntarily resigning a public post before the normal time for his retirement does so at a certain sacrifice. But this principle does not apply where the conditions of service  are essentially altered.  In  that case the official should have the right to choose, whether he will or will not go on serving under the new conditions, and if he prefers to retire, should be entitled to do so on the same terms as if his retirement had been compulsory.                4. Reservations  for the Protection of  Foreigners.               ,     To the general principle that the Egyptian Government should in future be free to determine for itself what posts are to be filled by non-Egyptians, the memorandum in Article IV, $ $ 3 and 4, makes two exceptions.   According to these clauses, a Financial Adviser and an official in  the Ministry of Justice, whose special function will be to watch the administration of the law as it affects foreigners, are still to be appointed &quot; in concurrence with His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;  It may be  asked, in view of what has already been said on this subject, why it was thought necessary to make these exceptions.   The answer is to be found in  the special  responsibilities which  under the proposed settlement Great Britain would assume for the protection of foreign rights.    The two points  of  supreme interest to the foreign Powers whose nationals  at present enjoy special privileges under  the Capitulations  are the solvency of Egypt, which  is not only of importance to the bondholders but indirectly affects all foreign capital and enterprise in the country, and the safety of the lives and property  of foreigners.   To  ensure these objects  the Powers will certainly continue to  insist  on the maintenance of some measure of foreign  control.  They have come to acquiesce in the  exercise of that  control by Great Britain.  But if Great Britain ceased to exercise it, they would  demand that some other Power or group of Powers should take her place.    It is, however, a fundamental principle of the contemplated settlement  that any powers, which may still be necessary  to safeguard foreign interests in Egypt and to assure  foreign Governments that the  rights of their nationals will be  respected, shallbe vested in Great  Britain.   This is the reason for the stipulation that the  two highofficials already referred to should continue to be appointed with the concurrence  ofthe British Government-the duty of the one being to ensure solvency, that of the
other to watch the administration of the laws as affecting foreigners.  The functionsof these officials are  only  described in general terms in the memorandum,  and thescope of their authority will have to be very carefully defined in drafting the Treaty.Here again we  had to content  ourselves with agreement in principle and  to leavedetails to be settled in future negotiations.     The same applies to the clause (IV, $ 7) which gives the British representative inEgypt the right, in certain cases,  to prevent  the application of Egyptian laws to foreigners.   This proposal was much discussed.   The  delegates were very  anxiousto avoid this right being converted into a general veto on Egyptian legislation.  We,on our side, did not desire this.  But the exact limits of the right were  difficult toagree upon, and for this reason alternative solutions are suggested in the memorandum,The subject, indeed, is extremely complicated.   But, stripped of technicalities, what it all comes to is this.  The Egyptian Government is  hampered at every turn by itsinability  to make laws applicable to the subjects of foreign  Powers  which  havecapitulatory rights in Egypt without the  consent of those Powers, though thatconsent may in some  cases &quot;be given on their behalf by the General Assembly of the mixed Tribunals.  As already explained, it  has always been  the aim  of&quot;british policy, and1 it is part of  the  scheme contemplated in the memorandum,  greatly to diminish  the restrictions thus imposed on the.legislative authority of the egyptian government.  But it would  be  practically  impossible, and it  is not proposed, toremove  these restrictions  altogether.  In so far as they are maintained, somebodymust have the right to exercise them.   In the  scheme  embodied in the memorandum it is contemplated that that right, intended  as it is to safeguard  the  legitimateinterests of all foreigners, should he conferred by Egypt on  a single  Power-GreatBritain.                                D. The Sudan.    The scheme embodied in the memorandum deals only with Egypt.   It has no application to the Sudan, a country entirely distinct  from Egypt in its character and constitution, the status of which is not, like that of Egypt, still  indeterminate,but has been clearly  defined by the Anglo-Egyptian Convention of the 19th January,1899* For that reason the subject of the Sudan was deliberately excluded from all our discussions with the delegates.  This was all along clearly understood by  them, but,in order to prevent any misunderstanding in Egypt of the scope of our discussions,Lord  Milner, when transmitting the memorandum to Adli Pasha, also handed him the following letter  : &quot; My  dear Pasha,                                            August 18, 1920.    &quot; Referring to our conversation of yesterday, I should like once  more to repeatthat no part of the  memorandum which  I am now sending you is intended to have any application to the Sudan.   This is, I think/evident on the face of the document,but, to avoid any possibility of future misunderstanding, it seems  desirable to  placeon record the view of the Mission that the subject of the Sudan, which has never beendiscussed between us and Zaghlul Pasha and his friends, lies quite outside the  scopeof the proposed  agreement with regard to  Egypt.  There  is a wide difference of conditions between the two countries, and in our opinion they must be dealt with on different lines.    &quot; The Sudan has made great progress under its existing administration, whichis based on the provisions of the Convention of 1899, and no change in the politicalstatus of Egypt should be allowed to disturb the further development of  the Sudanon a system which has been productive of such good results.    &quot; On the other hand, we fully realise the vital interest of Egypt in the supply ofwater reaching her through the Sudan, and  we intend to make proposals  calculated   *This Convention, which was signed by the Egyptian Minister for Foreign  Affairs  and LordCromer, laid it down that Great Britain was &quot; by right of conquest &quot; entitled &quot; to share in the settle-ment and future working and development &quot; of the Sudan.  By the acceptance of  this principle any claim of Turkey to suzerainty over the Sudan was disallowed, and that country was definitely excludedfrom the  area subject to the regime of the Capitulations. It was accordingly provided in the convention that the  jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals should &quot; not extend to or be recognised in any part ofthe Sudan,&quot; and that no foreign consuls should  reside  in the, country without the consent  of theBritish Government.  The supreme military and civil power was to be vested in the person of ,a&quot; Governor-General,&quot; who would be appointed on the recommendation of the British Government&apos; bya decree  of the Khedive of Egypt,  and whose  proclamations would have the force of law.
 to remove any anxiety which Egypt may feel as to the adequacy of that supply both for her actual and her prospective needs.                                                    (Signed)       &quot;MILNER.&quot;     &quot;His Excellency Adli Yeghen Pasha.&quot;     At this point it may be convenient that we should briefly state the reasons which, in our opinion, make it wholly impossible to contemplate, in the case of the Sudan, a settlement on the lines proposed for Egypt,  indicating at the same time the  general line of policy which appears most suitable to the present requirements of the former country.     While the great majority of the people of Egypt are comparatively homogeneous, the Sudan is divided between Arabs and Negroids,  and within each  of these  two great racial groups there are a number of races and tribes differing widely from one another and often mutually antagonistic.  The Arabs of the Sudan speak dialects of the same language as the people of Egypt  and are  united to them by the bond of religion.   Islam, moreover,  is  spreading even among  the non-Arab  races of the Sudan.  These influences mitigate in  various degrees,  but they have not overcome the antagonism  of the  two countries, which  rankling memories  of Egyptian misgovernment in the past have  done much to intensify.     The political bonds which have at intervals in the  past united Egypt with the Sudan have always been fragile.  Egyptian conquerors have at various times overrun parts and even the whole of the Sudan. But it has never been really subdued by, or in any sense amalgamated with, Egypt. The Egyptian conquest of the Sudan in the last century was  especially disastrous  to both countries,  and  ended in  the complete overthrow of Egyptian authority in the early eighties by the Mahdist rebellion.   For more than ten years no  vestige of Egyptian  authority was left in the  Sudan except in a small district surrounding Suakin. As  a consequence of this breakdown, Great Britain was  obliged to undertake  several costly  expeditions for the  rescue of the Egyptian garrisons and the defence of  Egypt, which  was in danger of being overrun by the Mahdist hordes.    Since, the conquest of the country by British and Egyptian forces under British leadership in  1896-8, the Government of the Sudan,  which under the Convention of 1899 takes the form of an Anglo-Egyptian Protectorate, has been virtually in British hands.   The  Governor-General,  though appointed  by  the  Sultan  (formerly  the Khedive)  of Egypt, is nominated by the British Government, and all the Governors of Provinces  and principal officials are British.  Under this system of government the progress of the Sudan in all  respects, material and moral, has been remarkable. When full allowance is made for the simplicity of the problem, viz., the introduction of the first principles of orderly and civilised  government among a very primitive people, the great  success actually achieved during the long Governor-Generalship of Sir R. Wingate is one of the brightest pages  in the history of British rule over back- ward races.   The present administration is popular in the  Sudan and, with few exceptions, peaceful and progressive conditions prevail  throughout the country.    But while Egypt and the Sudan are essentially distinct countries, and are bound to develop on very different lines,  Egypt will always have one  interest of supreme importance in the Sudan.  The Nile, upon which the very existence of Egypt depends, flows for hundreds of miles through the Sudan, and it is vital to Egypt to prevent any such diversion of water from the Nile as might diminish her present cultivable area or preclude  the reclamation of that portion of her soil, some 2,000,000 acres in extent, which is capable of being brought under cultivation, when,  by means of storage, the present supply of water  available for  irrigation has been increased. Hitherto the amount of water drawn from the Nile in its passage through the Sudan has been of negligible amount, but as the population of the Sudan increases that country will require more water  for its own  development, and a conflict of interest between it and Egypt might arise.  At the same time there is every reason to hope that, properly conserved and distributed, the  Nile  waters will suffice  for  all  the lands,  whether in  Egypt or the Sudan, which are ever likely to  require irrigation. The control of the waters of the  Nile for purposes of irrigation is a matter of such paramount importance and the technical and other problems involved are so difficult and intricate that it is, in our opinion,  necessary to set up a permanent  Commission, composed on the one hand  of experts of the highest authority and on the other hand of representatives of all the countries affected-Egypt, the Sudan and  Uganda to settle all  questions affecting the regulation of the  river  and  to ensure  the  fair distribution of the water.    The contiguity of Egypt and the  Sudan and  their common interest in the Nilemake it desirable  that some political nexus between the two countries should always
be maintained, but it is out of the question that this connection should take theform of the subjection of the Sudan to Egypt.  The former country  is capable ofand entitled to independent development in accordance with its own character and requirements.   It  is much too  early to attempt to determine its  ultimate politicalstatus.  For present purposes that status is sufficiently defined by the Convention of1899 between Great Britain and Egypt, which provides for the necessary politicalconnection between Egypt  and the Sudan  without hampering  the  independentdevelopment of the latter country.    Though it  is absolutely necessary for the present to maintain a single supreme authority over the whole of&apos;the Sudan, it is not desirable that the government of thatcountry should be highly centralised.  Having regard to its vast extent and the variedcharacter of its inhabitants, the administration of its different parts should be left,as far as possible,  in the hands of the native authorities, wherever they exist, under british  supervision.  A centralised bureaucracy is wholly unsuitable for the Sudan.Decentralisation and the employment, wherever possible, of native agencies for the simple administrative needs of the country, in its present  stage  of  development,would make both for economy and efficiency.  At the present time the officials of localorigin are still largely outnumbered by those introduced  from Egypt, with whomservice in the  Sudan is by no means popular.  This  difficulty will be overcome aseducation progresses and a greater number of Sudanese themselves become capable offilling official posts.  At the same time care should be taken, in the matter of educa-tion, not  to repeat the mistake which  has  been  made in Egypt  of  introducing asystem  which  fits pupils  for little else than employment  in clerical  and minoradministrative  posts,  and creates an overgrown body of aspirants to Governmentemployment.  There is no room in the Sudan for a host of petty officials, and educa-tion should be directed to giving the Sudanese a capacity and a taste for employmentin other directions, such as agriculture, industry, commerce  and engineering.  Theimmediate need, of the country is material development, and it can do without  an elaborate  administrative system.    The military forces still employed  in the Sudan  are very large.  A large army was, no doubt, required to complete the conquest and pacification of the country, butthe time has come when, in our opinion, the question of the number and organisationof its military forces should be reconsidered, and the financial burden upon Egyptwhich the maintenance of that force involves be reduced.  Hitherto,  the Governor-Generalship of the Sudan and the Command-in-Chief of  the Egyptian army  havebeen united in one person.  There were good reasons for this in the  past, but it isindefensible as a permanent arrangement.  At the  first convenient  opportunity a civil Governor-General should be appointed.    In  general it  should  be the aim of British policy to relieve Egypt from any financial  responsibility  for  the Sudan  and to establish  the relations of the twocountries  for the future upon a basis which will secure the  independent developmentof the Sudan while safeguarding the vital interests  of Egypt in  the waters of theNile.    Egypt has an indefeasible right to an ample and assured supply of water  for theland at  present under cultivation and to a fair share  of any increased supply whichengineering skill may be able to provide.  A formal declaration on  the part of GreatBritain that she  recognises this right  and  is resolved under all circumstances touphold  it would  go  far to  allay the uneasiness  which prevails  in Egypt on thissubject.   We are of opinion that such a declaration might with advantage be madeat the present  time.                   E.-Visit of Egyptian delegates to Egypt.       1    At  the close of the discussions  which resulted in the memorandum of the 18thAugust, Zaghlul Pasha and the other  delegates as well as Adli Pasha left london for France. Four of the Delegation (Mohammed Pasha Mahmud, Ahmed Lutfi Beyel. Said, Abdel  Latif Bey  el Mukabati, and Ali Bey Maher) proceeded immediately to Egypt in accordance with the understanding already referred to (see p. 23) in orderto enlist the support of their countrymen for the scheme outlined in the memorandum.The substance of that document, with certain inaccuracies of detail, had meanwhilefound its way into the press and been received in Egypt with expressions of approval.    About the same time  publicity was given in that country to a long manifestofrom  Zaghlul  Pasha, in which he emphasised the representative character of the delegation and the support which it had received from the nation.  He referred tothe endeavours made by the Delegation to submit the Egyptian  case  to the PeaceConference and to the world at  large, claiming that a considerable amount of sympathy had been gained in foreign countries.  He went on to speak of the appoint-
merit of the Special Mission and the obstacle to any direct contact with its memberspresented by insistence on the  Protectorate, the steps which had eventually led tothe visit of the Egyptian delegates to London, and the discussions which had takenplace there.  This document concluded by announcing that the proposals which had resulted from these discussions  would now be submitted to the nation by emissariesappointed for the purpose, and, should the project be favourably received, representa-tives would then be nominated to negotiate a treaty on the basis suggested;.    The inconclusive character of this message appears to have somewhat dampedthe enthusiasm with which the local committee of the Delegation in Cairo had, inthe first instance, greeted the announcement of a settlement.  The four emissaries,however, who reached Alexandria on the 7th of September, were received with warmdemonstrations of welcome and  their arrival  revived a  feeling of  optimism.  Atelegram from the local committee to Zaghlul Pasha expressed the confidence which&quot; the whole of the country &quot; placed in the Delegation and the prevailing enthusiasmof the public.  At the same time it was noticeable that there was a marked relaxation of that sense of strain and tension  which had  for some time past governed therelations between British and Egyptians, and conciliation was in the air.    It is  true that at first  a very determined  set was made against the proposed settlement by the Hisb-el-Watani and other extremists.  The critics maintained: thatthe contemplated independence of Egypt was not a reality, and specifically protested against the non-inclusion of the  Sudan in the scheme. Among the principal objectorsfour of the Khedivial Princes, who had signed the manifesto already referred to(see p. 4), now took the opportunity  to  publish in the  Arabic newspapers on the11th of September, 1920, a declaration that  their views remained  unchanged andthat they did not support any agreement which restricted the  independence of Egypt.But this  demonstration had little effect on the  public,  and in view  of  the  goodreception  generally  accorded to  the proposals   the Princes shortly afterwardsendeavoured to explain it away.    &apos; While the four emissaries of the Delegation  did not  enter into any contact with the official world in Egypt, every care was taken to ensure them complete liberty of action  and movement.   The procedure which  they adopted was to invite  small groups of representative Egyptians to meet them and to discuss the proposed settle-ment.   The  latter in  turn  reported to other groups  in  the provinces, whenceresolutions of adherence  were  received  by the four delegates, so that  within  a fortnight of  their  arrival it became evident that  a substantial majority of therepresentative elements in the country were favourable to the basis for negotiationwhich  they had  submitted.   But by  far the most  important testimony of general approval  was secured at  a  meeting  of the remaining members of  the LegislativeAssembly convened to.confer with the delegates  on the 16th  September.    Of theforty-nine members who were present on that occasion, forty-five recorded their votesin favour of the proposals.   Two abstained from any expression of opinion, and only two voted in opposition. Two other members who had been unable to attend in personwrote to express their concurrence with the project, which thus received the supportof forty-seven out of fifty-one surviving members.    At the same time, while this general approval was recorded, further interpre-tation of certain particular points was invited, and the hope was expressed that the delegation would on its return  to London obtain definite assurances  on these points.The most important of these was the universal desire for some definite indication that the Protectorate  would cease to exist with the conclusion of  the Treaty of alliance.          F. Concluding Interviews with Egyptian delegates in London.    The four emissaries returned from Egypt to Paris early in October, and  thererejoined Zaghlul Pasha and their other colleagues who had remained in Europe.At the end of the month the whole party, again  accompanied by Adli Pasha, once more came to London and had two further meetings with the Mission, at which thefour emissaries related their experiences in Egypt,  and  the  resulting  situation was discussed.  It was apparent  from the statement of the emissaries, confirming as it did the reports  which had  already appeared in the press, that the terms of theproposed  settlement had been well received by the Egyptian  public, and that thedetermined attempt which was  at first made to excite opposition to them had ended in complete failure.   At the same time, the emissaries did not fail to impress  upon us that the general approval  of the settlement was accompanied, on the part of the egyptians with whom they had  conferred, by  certain reservations,  and that theyhad been instructed to try and  obtain modifications of it on several points.   Whatthey chiefly desired was a&quot; limitation of the functions of the Financial Adviser and      [4941]                                                        F 2
of the British official in the Ministry of Justice; the abandonment of the provisionof Article 5 of the memorandum-that the coming  into force of  the contemplatedTreaty between  Great Britain and Egypt should be dependent upon  the previousconclusion of agreements with the Powers for necessary modifications in the regimeof the Capitulations; and, above all, the formal abolition of the Protectorate.   Someother points of minor importance were also  raised,  and it was evident that,  if allthese matters were to be gone into again, we should reopen the whole of the discussion in which we had been occupied for the greater part of the summer.   This was acourse in  which the members  of the Mission were unanimously of opinion that itwould be perfectly useless for  them to engage.   As we pointed out to the delegates,any agreement arrived at between us and them could not in any case be final.   all we  could  do  was  to  pave  the   way  for  the  official  negotiations,   whichmust be subsequently undertaken, if the  idea of a  Treaty on the lines which wehad  been discussing commejnded itself to British  and Egyptian opinion.    Thepoints now brought forward might all be raised in the official negotiations, as other points no doubt  would be on both sides, and for us to try and anticipate a decision upon every detail,  while  it  would  certainly  delay  the commencement of  those negotiations, might also seriously prejudice their successful conduct.    The point of view of the Mission was summed up by Lord Milner in a statement which he made at the second meeting of the delegates on the 9th November.  It wasto the following effect:     &quot; It seemed desirable to have this meeting before the departure of the Egyptianrepresentatives in order to clear up the situation and leave room for further co-opera-tion  between them and the  Mission in the future.    &quot; The report, which the gentlemen who  have lately returned  from Egypt have brought back to us, seems to indicate that there is a great body of opinion favourable to a  settlement on the basis outlined in the memorandum of August,   On the otherhand, they state that there  are several points in the memorandum which they desireto modify and several, fresh conditions which they wish  to add to it  before promisingtheir  unconditional support.   It is not necessary for me to dwell upon these points to-day, because the Mission are unanimously  of opinion that no good purpose wouldbe served by a further discussion of details at the present stage.    &quot; The memorandum never  professed to do more than indicate the general lines onwhich an agreement could be arrived at.  In any case, as we have always foreseen,the agreement itself, if it is decided to proceed with it, will have to  be the outcome of formal negotiations between  duly  accredited representatives of  the  British and egyptian  Governments.  In those negotiations  the fresh points which  you have brought forward as  the result of the visit of some of your number to Egypt  can beraised, as other points may be raised on one side or the other.  It would  be impossibleand undesirable  to exclude any proposals not evidently inconsistent  with the spirit ofthe agreement outlined  in the  memorandum,  which on  the  face  of it requireselucidation and elaboration before it can be converted into a formal treaty.  It wouldin our opinion not facilitate a settlement if we were to anticipate  these discussions,therefore, we  think  it wiser to refrain from any expression of opinion on the newpoints recently raised by you  at the present time, though we believe that a satisfac-tory solution can, and will, be found when regular negotiations can be undertaken.     &quot; What is far more  important at the present stage than any further discussionof details is to influence opinion both here and in Egypt in a sense favourable to asettlement on the lines which we both favour, and above all to cultivate and strengthenby every means  the spirit of friendship and  mutual  confidence  which  our conversa-tions here have helped to engender, but which must become general on both sides if our efforts are to lead to the desired result.   As far  as this country is concerned, we hope that the presentation of the report of the Mission, which we are anxious tocomplete as quickly as possible, will conduce to that end.  But it is  equally important that a similar effect  should  be produced in Egypt by your endeavours.  We gratefullyrecognise how much you have  already done in that direction.  But it is evident thatthere is  still  opposition  to be overcome, that there  are great numbers of people inEgypt who are not imbued  with the spirit of the agreement, but are for one reason or another hostile  to a gfood understanding between Great Britain and Egypt.  Theyare, or profess themselves to be, suspicious of the intentions of this country, they donot  recognise the generous spirit in which  Great Britain is prepared to meet theaspirations of the Egyptian people.  In so far as you are able to dispel  this suspicionand misunderstanding and create a better feeling you will be doing more than canbe done in any  other way  to  bring about  the settlement which we  all so earnestlydesire.&quot;
     To this statement Zaghlul Pasha replied in a speech, the gist of which was thatwhile he was as anxious as we were to help to create an atmosphere favourable to asettlement, he would be greatly weakened in  his efforts to do so by being unable togive any promise to the Egyptians about the proposed reservations, and specially by being unable to say that Great Britain had finally repudiated the Protectorate.   Tothe latter point he returned again and again, and he subsequently reiterated these views in a letter addressed to Lord Milner.     This was the last of our interviews with the Egyptians, who all left Englandshortly after it.  It is only necessary to add that the tone of our discussions remainedthroughout of the most friendly character, and that at parting, though no final agree-ment had been reached  and both sides remained uncommitted, we certainly gatheredthe impression that, reservations or no reservations, public opinion in Egypt had beenvery favourably impressed by the terms of the proposed settlement,  and that  most ifnot all of the delegates were hopeful  of its ultimate complete acceptance by theircountrymen,  and anxious to bring it about.                           IV. GENERAL SUMMARY.     In view of  the complicated nature of the subject, and the length to which our report though  we have striven to  omit all unessential  details has necessarilyrun,  we  desire to recapitulate  the  main features of the policy which we now recommended, and the stages by which  our conclusions have been reached.     When we arrived in Egypt we found a general state of unrest and discontent.The rebellion had been suppressed, but agitation was undiminished, and among an extreme group still took dangerous and violent forms.  Everywhere the demand was for  &quot; complete independence,&quot; beginning with the abolition of the &quot; Protectorate,&quot;which was construed as implying the extinction of Egyptian nationality.  To justifythis inference, the Nationalists pointed  to the refusal of the  British Governmentto  permit Egyptian Ministers to come to  London after  the Armistice,  to the deportation of Zaghlul Pasha and his associates, to the increase since the war in thenumber of British officials, and to the continuance of martial law.  At the same timethe  enunciation of  President Wilson&apos;s  fourteen points had  aroused wide-spreadexpectations, and the promise of self-determination to other Eastern peoples whomthe  Egyptians  thought  inferior to  themselves  had  added  to  their  discontent.Religious feeling had also been inflamed by the defeat of the Turks and the doubtsand uncertainties as to the future of the  Caliphate.     On the British  side  the situation was full of  difficulty.   A  large number of experienced officials had been lost to the  service since the beginning of the war andtheir places taken by new men who knew little of the traditional system by which,in the  days  of  Lord  Cromer,  British control was maintained without woundingEgyptian susceptibilities. The work of the Administration during the war deservesthe warmest  acknowledgment, but it necessarily entailed a certain subordination of egyptian to British interests,  and the  employment of rough and ready methodslikely  to be resented by a people whose sympathies were not actively engaged onour side.  When the war ended,  many of the old landmarks had  disappeared  andthere was a break of continuity with  the past. Martial law had become necessary,not merely to maintain order, but to carry on the  civil government; the &quot;Agent-General &quot; had become a High Commissioner who was also Commander-in-chief,  and though Egyptian Ministers  continued  to hold office, the Legislative Assembly was suspended.  The Administration  in these circumstances had to be carried on in theteeth of almost  universal opposition, affecting even the official class, upon whichthe Government had to rely for a large part of its executive work.    We soon  came to the conclusion  that  this situation could not be met by  anyreturn to the pre-war system or by any reforms of a merely departmental character.A more radical change was required to meet the new conditions.  But  the agitation against the  &apos;&apos; Protectorate&apos;&apos; had greatly  increased the difficulty  of  finding  anyacceptable policy which would satisfy the Egyptians while securing British interests.The  word &quot;Protectorate&quot; had&apos;become a symbol  of  servitude in the  minds  of the egyptians, and they  insisted that it must mean what they said it meant.  Argumenton this point was wholly  useless, and it  thus became evident to us that, unless wecould get on  to  new  ground,  it would be  impossible to reach  a settlement  byagreement.    Fortunately  the informal  conversations  which  we had with  leading men inEgypt encouraged us to hope that such a settlement was not impossible on new lines..They said with one accord that, though they objected to having an inferior statusimposed upon Egypt by the British Government, they would welcome a Treaty of alliance freely entered into on both sides, which, while establishing the independence
 of Egypt, would give to Great Britain all those safeguards and guarantees which the Protectorate, as we understood  it, was intended to secure.  The greater part of our subsequent work lay in examining this possibility, and our aim throughout has been to find the basis of a Treaty which shpujd supersede  all debates about  words and phrases, and be the sole  and final  definition of tire relations of Great Britain and Egypt.     There is nothing new in the  recognition of Egyptian  independence by  Great Britain.  Throughout our occupation  we have most carefully  respected the theory that Egypt was a national unit under the suzerainty of the Sultan of Turkey, and when  we  abolished the  Turkish suzerainty  we deliberately  chose to proclaim a Protectorate  in preference to annexing Egypt or making her part of the British Empire.  We have  constantly renewed our promise  of self-government for Egypt. We are of opinion that the fulfilment of this promise cannot be postponed.   The spirit of Egyptian Nationalism cannot be extinguished, and, though it may always be possible to suppress its more violent manifestations, the government of the country in the  teeth  of a hostile people, who charge  us with breach of faith,  must be a difficult and  distasteful task, alike  to those who take part in  it and to the British people who are responsible for it.     But there are formidable  difficulties in  the way of any  sudden, or complete transfer of all the powers of government  to Egyptian hands.   There  are essential British interests to be upheld; it is also imperative to ensure the safety and protect the rights of  the large number of foreign residents whose presence in Egypt  differen- tiates her position from that of  other Eastern countries and greatly complicates the problem.     The essential British interests  are that  the  great Imperial communications which  pass through Egyptian territory shall, not be jeopardised, either by  internal disturbances  or  foreign, aggression; that they shall be available in time of war, and for necessary  purposes in time of peace; that the struggle for  ascendency in Egypt between,rival Powers shall not be renewed; and, finally, that an independent Egypt shall not pursue a  foreign  policy  hostile or  prejudicial to that  of  the  British Empire. It is therefore necessary that any Treaty entered into between us and the Egyptians  should secure the special position of the British representative in Egypt, enable us to maintain  an, army on Egyptian territory for the protection of our Imperial communications, and take adequate security that Egyptian policy shall be in line with that of the British Empire.     The protection of foreign rights presents a, problem of even greater complexity.These are at  present secured by the Capitulations.  But the Capitulations are thegreatest of all the disabilities from which Egypt now suffers  (see note on p. 19).The  multiplicity of jurisdictions arising out of them, and the facilities which they give.to  men of uncertain nationality to escape from the local  jurisdiction greatlycomplicate  the problem of law and order; while  the  exemption of foreigners  fromdirect taxation,  other than the  land  and house tax, cripples the Government in raising revenue,  since it is in practice impossible to impose on Egyptians taxes  fromwhich foreigners are exempt.  Thus, although the wealth of the country is rapidly increasing and its resources are now ample for all the needs of good government, theAdministration  has  for  some time  past been compelled to starve essential public services, such as Education and Public Health.  During the war it has only beenpossible to raise sufficient revenue for the auxiliary police (Ghaffirs) by a special tax-imposed under Martial Law.     It was evident to us that, without the removal ;of these restrictions,  no Egyptian Government could enjoy any real independence.  To leave  an Egyptian Ministry to. struggle with conditions  which  threatened to bring the, present Administration to a stand-still would be to foredoom it to failure.  We foresaw that, if the. Capitulations were maintained, the Egyptian  Government without British support.would  in,all probability be exposed to a competing pressure of foreign influences, which mightparalyse its action.   It was  therefore, clearly in the  interests of Egypt that theCapitulations should be removed and the Mixed  Tribunals, reorganised so  as toenable  them to  take over the. jurisdiction of  the  Consular Courts,and to act. in criminal as well as civil suits affecting foreigners.   But this ;could only be effectedthrough the mediation  of Great Britain, and Great Britain could only, expect to succeed in inducing the Powers to part with their present privileges, if she were in,.aposition to assure them that solvency  would be maintained and that the lives and property of foreigners would be secure.  Our  efforts were accordingly directed to securing for Great Britain such a position as would enable her to give this necessaryassurance.  In order to achieve  this object, it  is necessary that any Treaty should provide for the right of Great Britain  to intervene in legislation affecting foreigners
and to exercise a certain measure of control over those branches of the administra-tion which most directly affect foreign interests.    Subject to these safeguards for the special interests of Great  Britain and theprotection of foreign rights, we hold that the Government of Egypt should be restored in fact to what it has always, during our occupation, been  in theory, a Governmentof Egypt by Egyptians.  We have sufficient faith in the reforming  work of the lastforty years to believe that such a course can now be followed with a good prospect ofsuccess.  But it must  be adopted wholeheartedly and  in a spirit of  hopefulness and sympathy.   Nothing would  be more likely to lead to failure than  to overload thispolicy with an excessive number of timorous restrictions, which would obscure theprinciple of Egyptian independence, create suspicion as to our real intentions, anddefeat  our main  object the  re-establishment of  mutual  goodwill  and heartyco-operation between British and Egyptians.    We make no attempt to  conceal our conviction that Egypt is not yet in a positionto dispense with British  assistance  in her  internal  administration.   But the egyptians know this,  and when  once the responsibility is clearly theirs, they will be slow to dispense with such help from us as is essential to the prosperity and good government of  their country.   They will be all the  slower to do so, because underthis system it will be impossible to attribute any failure that may  occur to Britishdictation, and because the good work of British officials in the future will redound tothe credit of the Ministers who are wise enough to retain them.  Moreover, the wholeatmosphere will, in our opinion,  be  completely changed when the Egyptians aresatisfied that the purpose of British policy is to help them to realise their ideal of independence and not  to stand in the way of its attainment.  We are greatly fortifiedin that belief by our  own experience in dealing with the representative Egyptianswith whom we  have  come into  such intimate contact.    Once  convinced  of the sincerity of our intentions they showed every readiness to appreciate our  point ofview, to recognise the  special interests which Great Britain  has in Egypt, the debt of grattitude due to her for her past  work in that country, and the indispensability of her future  help in  maintaining its integrity  and independence.  And we  are notdiscouraged by the fact that they were not all as yet prepared to commit themselvesunreservedly to every  point in the settlement which they had collaborated with us indevising.   We  make no doubt that they are wholeheartedly in favour of the main features of the settlement and that they are anxious to secure its acceptance by theircountrymen.    And, as far as  we can judge, public opinion in Egypt is  movingdecisively in that direction.  There is a sensible diminution of the bitter feelingand violent propaganda which were recently so prevalent, and the country is anxiousto settle down.   The moment is  favourable for placing the relations of Great Britainand Egypt on the satisfactory and enduring basis of a Treaty, which will at one andthe same time establish the independence of Egypt and secure the essential interestsof Great Britain.    It will be  an undoubted advantage to Great  Britain to havethose interests carefully defined and placed beyond challenge in a Treaty accepted bythe Egyptians, as it will obviously be  an advantage  to Egypt to have her integrity and independence guaranteed by Great Britain.  We therefore strongly advise HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  to enter without  undue  delay  into  negotiations with theEgyptian Government for the conclusion of a Treaty on  the lines which  we haveventured to recommend.  It would, in our opinion, be a great misfortune if thepresent opportunity were lost.    We have thought it desirable  to confine  this Report  to a description of  thegeneral situation in Egypt and  a  statement  of our main recommendations  as to future policy.   We  have  not included in  it numerous suggestions  which, in  thecourse of our investigations, we were led to make with regard to details of depart-mental administration and other matters affecting the educational and social progressof the country.  These  suggestions are embodied in separate memoranda, some ofwhich have already been placed at the disposal of the Foreign Office, as the rest willbe in  due course.   They are full of technical detail, and, though we believe them tobe useful, they are not of the same general public interest as the questions discussed in this Report.    One of these memoranda deals with the Antiquities Department, which, as we found in our conversations with the Delegation, the  Egyptians are quite willing toleave  under its present control.    We desire in conclusion to record our thanks to the two Secretaries of the mission and to express our appreciation of their  invaluable services.    Mr. A. T. Eoyd, the senior of the two, had, after many years  experience in
Egypt and in the Foreign Office, retired from the Public Service shortly before theMission began its labours.   But, yielding to the earnest request of our Chairman, lieagreed to accompany us to Egypt and to act as our principal Secretary there, thoughit was understood from the first that the call of other duties would not allow him toretain that position long after our return to England.  During our stay in Egypt wederived great benefit from his intimate knowledge of the country and the people, hisfamiliarity with all Departments of the Government, and his popularity both with british and Egyptians.    When  Mr.  Loyd left us in May last, the whole of the secretarial work of  theMission devolved  upon Mr. E.  M. B.  Ingram, of  the Foreign Office, who  had alsoaccompanied us to Egypt,  as assistant to Mr. Loyd and Private Secretary to lord milner. Mr. Ingram&apos;s duties during the last seven months have been very arduous,but he has discharged them with unfailing  zeal and ability, and we  are deeplyindebted to his assistance.                                                     MILNER.                                                     RENNELL RODD.                                                     OWEN THOMAS.                                                     CECIL J.
