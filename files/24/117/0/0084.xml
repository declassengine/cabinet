Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.               From Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of Stale,                              23rd December 1920.    Following is weekly telegram :     Bombay.-Reported  that moderates,  extremists and  Labour  Party preparingmemorial to British Cabinet for fresh declaration of policy, to effect India will  obtainfull responsible government  within specified  period; will  ask for  repeal repressivelegislation, and for sterner  Government action against military  and  civil  officerscriticised in connection with  Punjab disturbances.  Tilak institutions being  opened in nearly all  principal towns, but at  the same  time students&apos; situation improving.Establishment  of  such  institutions  due  to desire  to show respect for Tilak inconcrete  form,  rather than on account  of  secession of students from  Government-aided institutions.   Some intercepted correspondence shows considerable divergence of opinion regarding support to  be given to Kidwai, now editor of Jslamia Newsjformerly Muslim Outlook.   Muhammad Ali declared that no funds should be provided,while Shaukat Ali and Abdul Bari urged immediate cabling of funds.    Madras. In  continuation of  telegram  of  1.1th  December,  fuller  report ofBuckingham mills  riot in Madras.  Lock-out at  mills since 20th October, since whenno regular employee  at work, coolies, however,  being taken  daily to mills to keepthings in order and unload consignments.  At end of October, complaints made ofassaults on these coolies by regular hands, and police protection asked for and guardposted at mills.  Police  withdrawn on  assurance being given  by mill hands that noviolence will (sic)  be  attempted.  Undertaking  observed throughout  November, buton 2nd December a cart sent for  supplies attacked and looted.  Police guards placedon lorries carrying coolies from (? harbour) to mills.    On Sth December one  lorry attacked and three coolies injured.  Again  on 9th,lorry  attacked police attempting to arrest assailants.  On evening of 9th, larger escortdetailed to escort lorries.   One lorry  attacked by large crowds with stones; policearmed only with lathis succeeded in arresting two assailants.  Several constables anddriver of lorry hit with stones, and  one  man  severely wounded.  On second journeyfrom  mills, more persistent attack, and Deputy Commissioner of Police ordered lireto prevent men from  being overwhelmed.  Three rounds fired, crowd dispersed.  at night further journey had to be  made.  Lorry containing  Commissioner,  DeputyCommissioner  and three European mill employees stoned violently, and again threemore rounds of buckshot fired.   Lorry stopped to see whether any of  crowd had been hit, but it would have been dangerous to disperse the force, and no  casualties foundin immediate vicinity.  Sixteen persons wounded, 8 men, 1 woman and 6 boys since been  admitted to hospital.   One died shortly after admission, and another on 12th.Eleven of  16, including boy  whose death  was first  reported, are, or have been,mill employees.  Reported by Madras Government,  but (sic)  they have no doubt thatfiring absolutely necessary.  Police on  all these journeys submitted to most tryingform of attack.  Nearly all of (? them) were frequently hit  by stones-some seriously but discipline maintained throughout, and recourse to use of firearms was postponedto utmost extent  compatible with  safety.   Warning  would have  been futile,  asinaudible  in uproar prevailing.  No further disturbances  since 9th, and  harbour coolies able to proceed  to mills and. (? back)  without  molestation.    Objectionable article appeared in independent newspaper, Allahabad,  accusing Commissioner ofPolice of deliberate intention of taking  out his  men to murder labourers.  We have suggested to Madras that they should instruct Commissioner of Police to prosecute or sue editor for defamation.      Bengal. Elections passed off quietly, but all results not yet received.  GandhPs visit  has  had  no practical  effect, and situation  in  schools  and colleges  steadily improving.  Attempt being  made  by C. R.  (?  Das) to pack Nagpur congress with delegates  opposed to full programme  of non-co-operation.   Strikes in Howrah jute mills ended.  No  further developments reported  in mining  area.   Mr. Fazlul (sic) Iiuq, presiding over Bengal Mohamedan Conference, denounced boycott of  schools, and   described movement  as   immoral,  unjust  and  selfish.   It  would  reduce Mohamedans in India to position of political helots,
     United  Provinces. Centre  of  political  attention  lias  been  elections.    Incontested constituencies 33 per  cent, of electors voted.  Although non-co-operatorsactive, nothing untoward occurred beyond disturbances at Meerut and Agra reported last week.  New Council will  be fairly evenly divided, between  legal practitionersand landholders.   Gandhi and  non-co-operatorscomplctely defeated at Court of HinduUniversity.  Also failed at Allahabad College;     Punjab. Taken as a  whole,  elections  passed  off  satisfactorily.  In politicalcentres non-co-operators succeeded to  some extent in  dissuading voters  from goingto  the  polls,  but in rural  areas their influence was  less felt and the smallness of voting attributable lack of canvassing, apathy and exigencies of agriculture.   Lahoredisturbances  already  reported.  Strenuous  efforts  being made  by  extremists  toboycott  Government-aided  educational institutions.   Much  excitement created,  but owing  to  absence of suitable substitutes  for  existing schools movement likely toremain unpopular.   Khalsa College, Amritsar, and Islamia College, Lahore, reopened.Situation as regards Sikhs continues to deteriorate.  A  Sikh Dewanheld at Jnllundur,lasting six days, attended  by principal extremist leaders, and very violent speechesadvocating full programme non-co-operation  delivered.   Prominent  speaker Sikhagitator, for whose arrest for sedition a warrant issued, now a fugitive from, justice,but actively assisted by disaffected Sikhs of neighbourhood.   On strong  representa-tion of Local  Government, which regards solution (sic) (? situation) in  Sikh districtsas critical, we have decided to  apply Seditious Meetings Act  to whole of Lahore andJullundur Divisions, but have rejected request that Local Government be  empoweredto proclaim any district  in  Punjab going beyond necessities of case, and  dangerousas it might provoke widespread  disobedience  which  would  be difficult to deal with.Police  officers  freely insulted  at  public  meetings,  and  threatened, and  find it increasing  difficult to obtain  accurate record of   speeches.  With exception  ofJullundur Division, however, feeling in rural areas reported to be almost untouchedby  political agitation.                                   ,     Delhi.-(? Much) disturbed for causes  reported in last week&apos;s telegram.  Fourleading  obstructionists being  prosecuted  for  their  part  in  disgraceful incidentattending  funeral of Khan Bahadur  Maulvi Abdul  A had-.   A  demonstration  tookplace on 10th December, in Juma Masjid  (?word omitted) Imam, due to fatwas infavour  of  non-co-operation  announced at  Qlema&apos;s conference  last  month;  HakimAjmal Khan deplored  excesses by social boycott, especially  conduct at funeral anddemonstration against Imam,  and  publicly reprimanded populace  at the Mosque.Trial of four persons followed with close interest by public.   Khilafat paper currency in  considerable circulation in city and schemes propounded for provision of. Khilafatsilver backing.  Proceeds of sale  of paper to be devoted to minting of  Khilafat  rupees,professing to be  of slightly greater  value  than the standard rupee.   They  will bebanked at Khilafat Committee&apos;s offices  and  issued  in  exchange for note issues.  Noissue of coins yet so  far  as known.   There  is no doubt that Delhi  is  one of the(? centres) of sedition, and that it is more prevalent here than anywhere else.   We are considering what action, if  any, will be required to counter this during Duke&apos;s visit.Strike occurred amongst employees, Delhi Electric  Light and Tramway Company,but cause mainly industrial though political  undercurrent.    Management has  beenable to continue lighting, and Government power-house not affected.     North-West Frontier Province. Political interest  centred  in Peshawar.  Appre-appreciable widening of cleavage between Hindus and Mohamedans  since  visit  of  ColonelWedgwood.    At meeting  convened  to condole over death of Maulana Mahmud-ul-Hassan, Khilafatists openly accused  the  Hindus  of  lukewarmness, and  Hindusdisplayed little or no tendency  to associate with national non-co-operation.     Bihar and Orissa.  Gandhi&apos;s tour in  Bihar and Orissa appears to have had little effect  though he addressed large audiences in  Champaran, and  at  Patna promisedcomplete  Swaraj  within nine months.  We had had  some  disquieting reports situation in coalfields,  but strike in Standard Colliery Company came  to an end on thef 12th, management promising  20 per  cent, increase.    If mining association grantsame increase in the other colleries general strike in coalfields in near future unlikely,discontent being confined to more  highly-paid skilled labourers, who in first instancegranted an increase of pay proportionately less than that granted to the unskilled and low paid labourer.   Local Government has  situation well in hand, and  made arrange-ments in advance to deal with emergency,- should it arise, while avoiding any prematuredisplay of force.   Government  of Bihar and Orissa and Bengal Government are in
communication so as to ensure harmonious action.  Latest information is that Gandhiis directing his emissary, a so-called Swami, to leave the coalfields.    General. Gandhi has  denounced  social  boycott, but  has declared that his followers should take absolutely no part in functions during the Duke of Oonnaught&apos;visit.   Both parties work for Nagpur Congress C. R. J)as and Bengal leaders makingdetermined attempt to oust Gandhi, but latter will not give way easily.   On the whole,however, non-co-operation  does  not  appear to  be meeting with any  large measureof  success except  in  parts of  Punjab  and  Delhi,  though  his  influence  overmasses  is  gaining strength.   Wedgwood  caused considerable excitement  in his visit to Burma, among students.  He has followed up his previous attack on PunjabGovernment, replied to by (sic) that Government,  whom  he charged with  jerry-mandering constituencies,  by another and  more (?  detailed attack.  Main  chargerelates to  increase in  communal representation, presumably Sikh representation  is meant residential qualification for candidates, grouping of  urban areas, segregationof latter from rural areas, official representation of landlords and extension of franchiseto headmen.  We are asking Punjab  Government to reply.
