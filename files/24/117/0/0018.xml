JHFIDEHTIAL.                   CABINET.*-......                    .............,1,-2313.     THE EiP0R!EA3CB TO BRITISH TRADE  &amp;SD  INDUSTRY OF                       GRANTING CREDITS TO AUSTRIA.                   Memorandum from Sir William  Goode.               (Circulated by tho Chancellor  of the  Exchequer).                (Previous Papers C.P.  2139 and  CP.  2157).              The eztont to which United Kingdom  trade  and  industry         will be benefited by the participation of His  Majestv?^         Government in the scheme of-credits  to Austria suggested  in          0! i b i IJ e t        /Paper&quot;Hoo-CP,.2139 and-, alternatively,  the effect on British         trade if such credits are not forthcoming can  only bo deter-        mined by the part to be taken by Vienna  in  the financial  and         economic life of all tho Danubian States.              In 1913 the total exports of the  former Austro-Hungarian         Qnpire  amounted to over  115  millions  and the  imports to          141 millionsv (both these figures are at pro-war  rate of         exchange).  It is safe to estimate that  at  least 75 per         cent of this total of  256 millions  was  financed and arranged         through Vienna.  This does not include tho  large proportion         of the  trade of roumania, Bulgaria,  and  Serbia which was         also financed through Vienna.  In addition, tho invisible         trade of Vienna ran into many millions sterling, with far-         reaching effect upon all the  countries of South-Eastern         Europe  and on Russia.              It was anticipated that  with the  dissolution  ef the         Austro-Hungarian Empire Vienna would ceaso  to  be the financial         centre. In practice this is  not proving true. Vienna remains                            I         the  only centre in that part  of the  world with a recognised        machinery  of banking - founded on centuries of oxperience and         training.   Despite the position of the Austrian Government,         the  financing of trade not only with tho Secession States         (excepting Hungary), but with Bulgaria and  other countries,
Is more and more reverting to Vionna.  This apparent paradoxcan, perhaps, be most simply explained by quoting&apos; the analogy of the world1s Money Marmot.  After the war, every circumstancepointed to the Money Market oentering in New York.  the americans, with all or nearly ell the money in their hands,failed to grasp the opportunity booauso they were totallyIgnorant of the traditions and complex technicalities of a world Money Market.  Just as London held the Money Market20 Vienna is holding her own.  Large British institutionssuch as the Co-operative Wholesale Society, the BradfordTyccl Combine, otc*, are today contemplating not merelyfinancing their experts to Danubian States through  Vienna,  butalso making that city the entrepot for thoir goods.  the geographical position cf Vienna and its importance as a centre of Danube PJ.\er and railway traffic naturally attractsenterprise of this character.                  dispute     It is beyond/that anything affecting Vienna must alsoaffect to a serious degree the trade of the wholo ofSouth-Eastern european  The inconsequence of consideringVienna only in connection with the trade of German-Austria wouldbe evident to anyone who reads the confidential report onthe holdings and interests of the Boden Credit Anstalt,recently sent to the Foreign Office by the British Ministerat Vienna.  This Austrian financial institution still exorcisesin the succession states and adjoining countries an important influence upon trado and finance.  There are other AustrianBanking houses playing an equally important part in thofinance of South-Eastern Europe*     It is impossible to estimate the economic consequencesinvolved by the dissolution of Vienna,,  If this financialcentre and trado gateway breaks up, the restoration of Central                              - 2 -
and South-Eastern European markets will be indefinitely poet-poned, and the Opportunity of obtaining trade formerly inGerman hands will be lost.   Without  these markets Britishindustries will find it still harder  to provide employment forBritish labour.  You cannot scrap what in 1912 waB the channelfor some  200 millions of European trade without disorganisationthat, directly or indirectly, must gravely affect British trade the credits required under the proposal - 2^0 million dollarsspread over five years - are infinitesimal compared with thepossible volume of trade at stake.        while the main issne is the Importance of Vienna in re-lation to all Danubian markets, the possibilities of trade be-tween the United ringdom and Austria  itself are not to be over-looked.  In 1912 British exports to Austria-/Hungary amounted toover  6,000,000 with another  4,000,000 to adjacent countries,largely financed-through Vienna.   The principal items werecotton yarns, woollen yarns, and piece good3, and machinery.Austria, as it ie today, still requires for home consumption andre-export some of these commodities,  and more particularly other commodities whi ch she obtained *in pre-war days from Germany tothe extent, in 1.912, of  51 millions.   I am inclined to thinkthat the relatively email United Kingdom pre-war trade throughVienna can be appreciably increased provided Austria is g,?^en a five years lease of political and financial -life.   .If it is not given, there is not the. slightest ch-an.ee of regaining even ourpre-war trade with that part of the world.        The immediate result of giving Austria credits should beto provide employment -in the United Kingdom in order to sppplythe 1 requirements of the. following Auetr Lan ,in^striea.        Th0 Automobllei Trade. Brass,  aluminium, copper,, zinc,wheels, driving chains, magnetos, dynamos, leathers,, driving belt?,driving wheels-; lubricatirig-oals, paints and vamiehes.        The Hardware Trade..- -Sheet iron, iron.wire,  colours forenamels.
        The Rubber trade *  Fine yarns and canvas for tyros.        The Textile Trade.  Cotton yarns of fine counts,  sewingsilk and thread, noils for hat making,  tapestry for furniture,textile machinery, and dyestuff8.        The Sicctrical Trade.  Accumulators,  turbines and all  the heavier class of machinery which will be required in connectionwith the development of Austrian water power.        In addition, the rencvral of manufacturing in Austriawould provide for United Kingdom exporters of raw material  ofBritish Empire origin a much needed market for their presentlarge surplus - a surplus which is likely to  continue for someyears.  For example, the  6%0,000 raw wool credit&apos; recently approved by the Treasury out of the existing  Relief Vote  is so arranged as practically to compel not only a  repayment of the credit but a re-purchase of wool to an equivalent or greateramount, to the benefit of the United Kingdom  merchant and theColonial grower.  Transactions on similar lines could becarried out with regard to hides,  cotton, copper, rubber,feathers and other goods.  The control of the management  of suchexisting Austrian monopolies as tobacco, salt and timber  by united Kingdom caxital should also provide new markets for united Kingdom machinery and accessories.        The possible extent of direct trade vith Ai&amp;tria  is, how-ever, only of secondary importance compared with the economicdisorganisation which will result if the financial pivot  oftrado with South-Eastern Europe ceases to revolve.  Considered inrelation to the volume of trade which can be  controlled and,wuth an improved currency, increased through  Vienna, the  UnitedKingdom share of the required credits would appear to be  a emailinvestment to make for the prevention of the  stoppage of  tradeand the unemployment that must inevitably ensue upon thocollapse of Vienna.November 12. 1920.2 Whitehall Gardens..S.W.1.
