Unemployment is increasing.  Thesteadier ex-Service men in Sender are, however, making a stand against the extremist&quot;sections.     A suggestion Is made of new sources of relief for theunemployed which might be tapped.     Only about twelve delegates attended the CommunistConforence at Manchester.  There is to be another &quot;UnityConference&quot; on January 29th end 30th.  Inkpin is charged withthe negotiations and may be trusted to favour the formerBritish Socialist Party,  In London the Hampstead CommunistParty gave a banquet at Pinolirs, with KLishko as a guest of honour.     A British sailor at Malta has written a very frankexpression of his opinion to Sylvia Pankhurst.     A Bolshevik courier has been arrested at South Shields.     The text of the circular  sent out by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;Trade Union Committee is given.     Sinn Peiners in England have been overawed for the momentthough the violent $action in  Ireland is plotting a reprisalcampaign in the Glasgow area.

&apos;TO5MPL0YMTT         The cold weather has added greatly to the sufferings of    the unemployed, whose numbers continue to increase.  The    tragedy of the situation outweighs the danger of revolutionary    action, although hunger may easily lead to violence.         In London the various  unemployed committees have, with    one exception, vacated the seized buildings but the &quot;Communist&quot;    reports that at a recent demonstration to the Islington    Guardians, the men lined up in platoons, with a sergeant in    charge of eaoh,         At an unemployed meeting at Battersea on the 10th fifty    men marched to Clapham Junction and some were so drunk and    disorderly that the Poli.ce were obliged to arrest four, among    them Councillor Wheel or of the Battersea Borough Council.         A sharp distinction must be drawn between the real    unemployed and tho unemployable.  It is the latter class    who have been mobilised by the Communists for seizing public    buildings; the sounder men suffer in silence and disapprove    of such conduct.  What they do want is some arrangement which    will allow them to carry collecting boxes,-and this is now     being fevourably considered.&apos;         In Acton there has been some friction between sections    of the unemployed; ex-Service men have informed the Council    that of the men who have seized the baths, only 23$ were from    Acton and that; the movement originated in the International    Socialist Club.  The men in the baths retaliated by    threatening violence but vacated the premises on December 14th.         The unemployment figures for Lancashire last week,    which show an increase of about 6,500 on the previous week    and do not include the unemployment caused by the cotton    trade depression, are as follows:                                                Liverpool/

Most of the  mills are closed  on  Monday&apos;and  Saturday  and on the remaining  days  are working 6  hours  a day. Blackburn      28 cotton mills  stopped last week,  being  an increase of 4  on  the previous  week. Bo1ton      A  35  hour working week  is in operation and  likely to continue until the end of January.   Consideration for the operatives has,  so far, prevented the institution of a shorter working&apos; week. Burnley      unemployment  is  increasing.   Only 35^&apos;  of  the looms  are running on 38 hours   a week  as against 48 hours, and  in  somemills not  a. third of  the  machinery is  running.   In  the last six weeks  of this quarter  the Burnley  Weavers&apos; association has suspended members&apos; contributions  and therefore  lost   8,500in revenue.:  During the same period  the  Association has  paid 3,800  to members for breakdowns.Darwen   .  16 weaving sheds and  1  spinning mill are  closed, 10 millsbeing closed for an indefinite period.

There is great distress amongst the operatives, some of whom ere endeavouring to find employmentin other trades.MM     Over 8,000 operatives are out of employment in thedistrict, and others are on short time.  There is a steadydrain on the funds of the Weavers&apos; Union, and some of themembers have drawn the full amount of stoppage pay which thetrade union rules allow.Nelson     Distress is acute.

In &quot;Yorkshire my correspondent reports that things appearto he&apos; going from had to worse and there are signs that actualstarvation will ensue within the next month or so in theheavy woollen districts of Dewsbury, Ossett, Bradford andHuddersfield.  Shorter time still is being worked and manymills are closing down entirely.

TH3 COMOTISTS     The Communist Meeting held in Trafalgar, Square last gSunday to protest against &quot;the savagery of the sentehees                                              imposed/numbers  of men  are  on  short time.  Work is practicallyunobtainable and although extensive schemes are contemplated by the local authorities, the outlook is  reported to bogloomy.     On  December 10th  it was stated et a meeting of the liverpool, Bootle and  District Unemployment Committee thatof the 13,000-14,000 local unemployed 9,000 were ex-Sorvicemen.     Complaints are being made in  this and other districtsthat many men are debarred from drawing unemploymentinsurance pay as they  are unable to obtain the neoessarystamps.;     There is a strong public sympathy for the unemployed and it appears to be the moment for turning this sympathyinto.practical channels.  In the United States there is a growing practice of employed men surrendering their places for a week or two to the unemployed.  This may be impracticable here but it is certain that if .an appeal wer(mudo to the many&apos;thousands who are in regular employment -civil servants, shop assistants end workmen - to contributesomething,  however small, either in money or in kind,  toan organisation whica would undertake to distribute therelief to the most pressing cases there would bo a re-aw&amp;kening of the feeling of solidarity between all classes)The local councils&apos;  relief committees might.be used asdistributing agencies.   I believe that the response to suojan appeal would be - surprising.
 imposed upon Communist propagandists&quot;. Halone, Steele,Harvey and Sylvia Pankhurst, was attended by barely 300people, although the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; had preparedus  for the &quot;finest Communist Demonstration of the year&quot;.The money thrown on the plinth amounted to  5.  It was observed that a good many Japanese of the student classwere keenly interested in the proceedings.     Passages from the speeoh made by Beecham illustrate the way in which Communist agitators are exploiting theunemployed:          &quot;I believe that our men are being put away because     the Authorities feel that real live Communist speakers     get amongst the unemployed, get amongst the soldiers and     sailors, getting&apos;into every sphere where they can create     a revolutionary atmosphere.......The most active     members, are Communist workmen.  They are telling the     unemployed that they have no right to starve in a land     of plenty.   They are telling them, further, that if you     are hungry then take food, whether it is legal or illegal.-     We say to them this afternoon, the unemployed, &apos;You have     a right to possess theee things&apos;.  To the thousands of     unemployed, to the thousands of ex-Service men, we say     TYou have no right to stand in the cold while there are     warm places waiting for you to occupy.  If you do, then     you are a damned coward. ...... We say to those unemployed     that have taken possession of the libraries and the     baths and the Town Rails that while they have every     right to this, they want to take possession of the     things to eat.&apos;&apos; It is no good, you cannot live on     library books,  You want something to eat.&quot;     If there were a solution of the unemployment problemit is probable that the local branches of the variousCommunist Parties would cease to exist.  In the Bull Ring,in Birmingham, for instance, where violent speeches aremade, the opening of f  free canteen for ex-Service men has reduced the audiences to a handful, for they prefer food tofroth.   In Liverpool the audiences appear to come becausethe halls are warm.  My correspondent reports that he hasoverheard&apos; conversations such as:-     &quot;What sort of  a meeting is this?&quot;     &quot;It  seems to be Bolshie.&quot;                                                 &quot;Why/ ,
     &quot;Why did you come in?&quot;     &quot;To get warm.&quot;     On December 11th ihe Rompstead Communist Party held its first annual dinner at Pinoli&apos;s &quot;under the Chairmanship ofComrade Ronry Hoase&quot;.  Fifty-four people were present, includingMai one&apos;, Kehrhahn and other well known Communists, and Klishkoand the worran with whom he lives, Phyllis Frood, wero there asguests of honour.  Andrew Rothstein and his mother also acceptedthe invitation, but added, &quot;the less outside publicity the better.&quot;  It must be confessed that for Communists thoy did  -themselves pretty well,  as may be seen from the attached copyof the Menu, mis-spelling and all.  The proceedings were broughtto a close by the singing of the Prolotarion (sic) Anthem&quot;TTho Red Flag&quot;,   lishko did not speak but his attendance: at tilldinner, knowing that it was a political one, was a breach of hisundertaking.  It is interesting to note that his confidentialsecretary, Mrs. Palmer,  acts as intermediary between the Delegatand the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,  where her husbanJL is employed.     The &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee, which is now practicallyidentical with the Communist Party, has issued a circular toall affiliated trade .unions, appealing for funds for Maione1sdefence.  Collecting sheets are being circulated with an airof great secrecy.     Mrs. Dora Montefiors iss the author of a scheme for adoptingtne children of Hungarian Communists by Communist families inTing land.  In her circular she insists that it must not be known,except to members of the Party, that the children are Communists     W.

Tig BRITISH AMD  INDIAN LABOUR MOVStJEBTS          B. P. Wadia has written to J.    Potter Wilson,  of  the     Workers Welfare League of  India, which is a centre of     extremists, regarding the  relations between the British  m d                                                          the     Indian Labour movements.   He states that while he has/greatest     Respect for the earnestness of some members of the League, he     does not know if he can equally appreciate their discriminate     or judgment.  Some clear understanding of the principles  and     policy of the League must  be reached before the All India     Trade Union movement would affiliate.  Wadia also enquires if     the British Trades Union Congress will recognise the  League,     &quot;because what is important for our movement in India  is  to get     it affiliated to the Trades Union Congress of Great Britain. :          Wadia infers that ne  baa l&amp;tt &quot;political life&quot; and wishesj     that &quot;Chamanlal and other  friends&quot; would do the same  in  India.          An interesting sidelight on the connection between  the     Indian nationalists and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is provided by a     resolution passed at the All India Trades Union Congress whicl     recorded &quot;its emphatic protest against the action of  the    &apos;(     Government in proscribing  the &quot;Daily Herald&apos; of London.&quot;  The     Congress further expressed Its appreciation of the work  of     the London League and of Saklatvala and authorised its StandiDi  &apos;&apos;   committee to get into touch with the League with a view to     closer co-operation.CONMDMCSS n\OU ECOLS-gPOH SQ.UARS          The private views of prominent labour men, as distinct     from their public utterances, are of interest; Page Arnot,     who. by virtue of his work at &quot;,ccleston Square, has exceptional     facilities for observation recently gave it as his opinion     that                                                   &quot;The/
     &quot;The &apos;Heraldf attitude is that ox a vessel oh a leftward oourse which is tacking continually to theright; and I quite agree with you that some day, ifit is not careful, it will tack too far and find thatit has lost its original oourse.  This, is particularlyso since Francis Meynell left the directorate.     &quot;Brailsford I met recently at a meeting of enAdvisory Committee of tho Labour Party.  I was agreeablysurprised to find him much less Humanitarian and muchmore Bolshevik then he was before.  His visit to Russiaseems to have had a salutary effect on him; though Ido not suggest that ho is yet a Communist.  -     &quot;Roden Buzton I saw last week.  I am irritatedpersonally just now with the rubber teats for Germanbabies, because all the people who are putting money in that class of goods are refusing it to the LabourResearch Department, which is much moro likely to injure capitalism than a forest of rubber teats.     &quot;Murphy is a good  ellow; but for the life of meI cannot see tho sen^o of talking about including the shop Stewards7 movement in the Red T.U. International.Tho Shop Stewards&apos; movement, as a movement is notmerely in decay: IT NO LONGER EXISTS.  To talk about itas if it did is mis loading.  As an idea it will certainlypersist, and will grow, and when the time comes there willbe a renaissance and we shall have a movement once more.At the moment though, we might as well talk ofaffiliating the Chartist movement to the Red T,U.  *International.  Of one thing I am quite certain; that in britain, at any rate, the Communists have got to workinside the Trado Union organisations.  This they must do,unless they propose to repeat the experiment of St. Simonon the Pillar.&quot;&apos;THE NATIONAL UNION OP EX-SERVICE MEN      Tho National Union of Ss-Service Men ha3 recently been^ to the fore in unemployment troubles in the London area and v a meeting of the West Ham branch on December 12th was addressed by H. T. McDonald, who works for the union and for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   He said that the National Union of Ex- , Service Men stood for communism as it was carried out in Russia.  Although the Reds there had done some firing it was the Whites who had started it and it would be the Whites in this country who would commence it when the time came.  A great crisis in the  history of this country and the world/was near at hand; all countries were desiring a change of                                                   system/
system and they were looking to Great Britain to give them the lead.  Although he detested violence ho hoped that when this crisis came the members of the National Union of Ex-Service Men would not forget what thoy were taught by theGovernment whilst serving in the Army.A SAILOR&apos;S LSTTSR TO SYLVIA BANKHURST     The following letter, which has come into my hands,seems to show that Communism has not penetrated very far intothe Lower Deck:-                               Post mark  Malta 5.12.20.          &quot;Idiot,                 I foam at the mouth at having to write to a          person who is not fit to be allowed to roam about          loose in such a place as Englend..

 THE  INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY          The manifesto of the Left Wing 6V Communist sections     of  the Independent Labour Party has produced yet more     divisions in the ranks of the extremists.  On the one hand,     the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; complains that its reference to     parliamentary institutions is &quot;highly dangerous&quot; and adds     that until the Left Wing has decided to plump for the     complete abolition of Parliament, it&quot; will not be ready to     join the Third International.  &quot;Forward&quot; on the other hand,     which represents the Right Wing, and is, above all, verbose,     &apos;writes:               &quot;The rain of manifestoes about the 2, Z\t    and          4 Internationals keops on steadily, and the barometer          is set &quot;stormy&apos;  for more.

      &quot;We appear to have been boycotted by commercial advertisers.  Whenever a big industrial dispute becomes acute and the  &quot;Herald1 comes out day after day hacking  the men, down, comes our advertisement revenue.  We do not believe there is room in the Labour movement for a paper whose policy is influenced by advertisers.    &quot;With a Manchester Printing Centre wa could print much  later for the North, and could give Parliamentary and Foreign News.      &quot;We believe a Labour Press ought to be pushed in Ireland.      &quot;A new building in Manchester is offered to us for  46j000.  It is well built arid will be sound collateral security.  The premises are admirable from the point of view of health.      &quot;Part of the premises is let on a twenty-year lease at  600 per annum.      &quot;We are offered plant for  25,000.      &quot;It is proposed to conclude an agreement with the National Labour Press, Ltd., whereby they will move their business to these nremises and act with us.      &quot;We are also about to acquire a printing establish- ment  in London which would provide further security.      &quot;We offer the movement a Five Per Cent investment, with  the interest guaranteed for five years.  The minimum investment ic  100.      &quot;We need an aggregate circulation of 450,000 daily; by printing also in Manchester we believe we can soon get&quot; it.      &quot;We ask for this purpose a maximum of  200,000.      &quot;We should, try to give a &quot;Northern&quot;  atmosphere to the Northern Edition, and should seek the advice of a body in the North like the Trade Union Committee which has served us in the South.      &quot;It will take about four months to get going if we get the money promptly.      &quot;The Leader-page and special articles would be the same throughout for all editions.      &quot;The final arrangements will be submitted to the Debenture Holders for their ratification.     &quot;About seventy Societies have invested to date.     &quot;It is practically impossible to  run a-dailynewspaper now at Id.  without subsidies.     &quot;Wo ardently desire to supply the Labour movement                                          with/
     with a Sunday paper, and that will be made easier if     the present venture succeeds.         fWe appeal for broad tolerance and a realisation     of the impossibility of pleasing everyone.          &quot;If a Debenture-holding Union were in distress     at any time the Directors would certainly do whatever     they could to help them realise on their investment.          &quot;Special meetings of Executives were suggested     by a Delegate.          &quot;By owning our own premises and plant we want to     make sure of being able to produce our paper in times     of trouble.&quot;     The following are members of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; TradeUnion Committee:                Charles Duncan, J.P.

Pettersen is donkey man on thes.s. &quot;Stirling&quot;.  It appears that he has been in the&apos;habit of receiving from a member of a Christian Mission at Christianiaa parcel containing books, pamphlets and valuables, and handingthe parcel ever to members of the Communist Party in thiscountry.  The present parcel contains a quantity of propagandaliterature printed in Russia.     There is little doubt that Pettersen is an important                                                      link/

She reached the height of calumny in    the columneof the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on December 14th, making    scandalous allegations against the treatment of Irishwomen    by the Crown Forces.         The Labour Commission appears to be doing as muoh harm    as possible, both in  this country and in Ireland;  two members    openly state that the Cork outrages were the work of Government    servants.         Dr. Mannix has accepted&quot; an invitation to speak at Preston,    pr ob ably on&apos;December 19 th or 23rd,         Froin&apos;Glasgow it is&quot; reported that the inner ring of Sinn    Fein Particularly the&quot;Clan-na-Gael is considering the question    of joining forces with&apos;the iooal revolutionaries.         My correspondent reports that a Sinn Fein meeting took    piece on December 11th at 171, Benfield Street, Glasgow.  Six    representatives of the&quot; Govan Sinn Fein body, and 5 members of    the Volunteers&apos;attended to discuss the question of opposing    Government, action against local Sinn Feiners.

     Irish Republican Headquarters in Dublin are anxiously av/ai     the arrival of three Bolshevik emissaries from Russia.          The papers seized on the premises of Art OfBrien     in London and his banking account show that he has been     financing the Sinn Fein representatives abroad as well as j     the persons concerned in attempting to introduce munitions     from Germany into Ireland.  He has also been negotiating j     with Indian and Egyptian extremists and has been attempt^!     get an Irishman trained as an aviator.  The question of hii     internment is being considered.IRELAND          There has been no material change in the state of the     provinces during the past week.   The number of outrages     decreased from 258 to 239; of the total number of outrages     135 were attributable to Sinn.Fein, one was of an agrarian     origin and 103 were crimes of a serious nature not attribu     to political or agrarian motives.  Intimidation by threatot     letter and violence was prevalent.          The announcement that Martial Law is to be proclaimed     in the South West of Ireland was welcomed by the law abid     elements in the community.  The  strict enforcement of Marti     Law will undoubtedly have a good effect and should succeed     re-creating confidence in the determination of the Govern!     to succeed in the crushing of the murderous Irish republic     Army which confidence was being  undermined by the rumours o     negotiations with the leaders of the murder gang.          During the week-end extensive damage was done in Cori     fires which appear to have occurred simultaneously in sever     of the principal  buildings.   The British Labour delegation     to Ireland allege that the fires were the work of the Force     of the Crown and the Parliamentary Labour Party is demandi                                                        an/
 an  enquiry.      It  is reported  that the National Executive of the Irish Labour Party has  issued a manifesto advising railway and dock  workers to  carry everything  that the British Military authorities are willing to risk on trains.  Railwayman are urged to hold themselves in readiness to respond to any call, which will not, however, be made unless justified by vital national interests.  Trade is becoming increasingly bad and unemployment is rife.      The Sinn Fein papers appeared as usual,  &quot;young Ireland&quot; contains a leading article on &quot;The Truce&quot; in which it refers to the activities of the Crown Forces as not being indicative of a  desire for Truce on tne part of the Government and advises the continuance of the work which has been so well done up to the present and &quot;in the words of Mr.  Arthur Griffith to stand ^ast&apos;&quot;.      &quot;Old Ireland&quot; contains an article signed Proisnsias 0 Gallohobhair (Prancis Gallagher) headed &quot;A Truce with Tyranny&quot; in which attention is drawn to the sacrifices made for Ireland by Terence McSwiney and Eevin Barry and casting scorn on the weaklings who doubt, and states - &quot;All of us would welcome a truce.   But the nation cannot,  mustnot and will not accept any truce but one which  placesupon the head of our nation the Crown woven for  her by the .dead.&quot;
