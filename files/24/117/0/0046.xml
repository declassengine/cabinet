HOWORTH,   Secretary,  Finance Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens. S.W*1.   10th December, 1920.Dear Hankey,British Delegation,  Hotel Beau Riv&amp;ge,      Geneva.   7th December, 1920.      I am much obliged to you..for your letter of the2nd December enclosing an extract from the Minutes ofthe Finance Committee of -the Cabinet at their Meetingon Monday,. November 29tliv -  ..- :.-: ;      The estimate of  68,800,000 of course coversScotland and Ireland as well as England..   I notice thatthe Crbi.net Committee appears to attribute a considerable part of the increase to those provisions of the 1918Education Act which had been put into operation, notablythose dealing with Continuation Schools. .  So far as  &apos; *England is concerned this statement dons not represent thefacts.   We estimate that the gross expenditure for1921-22 on Continuation work In England and Wales mayamount to about  600,000 of \fciich the Board will have tocarry about  400,000 at the outside In grants.   It is not/therefore
therefore correct to suggest that for 1921-22 a substantial part of the  9,000,000 increase on our estimate would bedue to.the operation of Continuation School provisions ofthe Act.   The increase is mainly due to the increase of salaries.      I notice secondly that it is pointed out that thegrowth of our estimates is largely due to the fact thatthe Board of Education grants are now dependent on theexpenditure of the local Education Authorities.   This,of course, is perfectly true, but it is not true that thegreater part of this increase has anything to do withthe Act.   The expenditure based on the grant wasadopted some time before the Act of 1918 when the leader of the House was Chancellor.   All the Act didwas to guarantee to local Education Authorities aminimum of 50$ of their expenditure.   It is difficultto imagine a large public service (the cost of whichis shared between the State and the Local Authority)which could be subsidised by the State on a. scale lessgenerous than 50^.   If an attempt were made to cut downthis proportion    the system of local administrationof education would undoubtedly break up.   The only question is how far we can legitimately by administrationforce the Local Authorities to cut down their  expenditure by refusing to recognise new institutions for  grants,or by telling them in advance that certain kinds ofexpenditure, e.g. certain medical services, will notbe subsidised at all.      I  do not know ?fhat is meant by  the,fstirring up&quot;circular*   Probably it refers to Circular  1175 ofSeptember, 1920, which urged the Authorities  to workout programmes for the next  three or  four years withestimates of  cost attached.    I  think our action  inrespect  of this  circular ought to be  welcomed  by  theCabinet  Committee  as evidence  that we are  insisting upon local Authorities facing their liabilities  and disclosingthem both  to  ourselves and  their constituents.   the circular is,  in  fact,  an  incitement,  not  to extravagance,but to  economy.    I hope  in any  case  that  the CabinetCommittee  will wait till my return until  they discuss theEducation  Votes  in  any detail.    I  think  I  have a rightto claim that no important  decision   should be taken in myabsence.    I  am,  of  course,  with the  Prime  Minister-spermission,,  ready to return at  any moment,  though in viewof the  great  mass  of  work  falling on the  british delegation here,  1  should  be very reluctant to do so.Yours sincerely,(Signed)   H.A.L.
