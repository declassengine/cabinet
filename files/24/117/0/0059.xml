P.,  3359.                                          .    1                      Uoto by tho Secretary cf  State for foreign                      ________    _Affairs_               I  have  aeon tho Iloto by I.a\.  ilcntagu dated December 24th ^ O.P.508 .      in which he  questions the Statement nude in War Office- telegram         8YJ53 9  oi December 23rd.  tc G,O.C,  Baghdad that &quot;She Cabinet are         anxiouo  to reduce expenditure in iiooovotaiaia by withdrawal to a         position covering Basra at tho earl loot possible  moment&quot;.               lire uontagu save  ho is not aware of any such  decisions         Neither  am I.               But I object,  if  possible, even  more to the  succeeding         sentence in  the  same  telegram               &quot;It is  understood  that the Cabinet regard the necessity         for  tho  early reduction  of expenditure by the withdrawal of         military forces  as entirely overruling any considerations  for         the  internal  security of. the country after our troops  have left:         and  tailing this  for  the  moment as  your oasis of calculation the         time required for organising local forces in tho  evacuated area         need not bo taken into  consideration by you&quot;a. -               I read these  remarks with  maazomont,  because I  could         neither  imagine  the  Cabinet arriving at any such dooision, nor         could  I  in the Hinutes  of any I/looting, either of  Cabinet,  Confers.         ence or  Committee,  find the smallest trice of it.    On the         contrary tho  Minutes of the finance Cormitteo (which I was unable:                                that         to attend)        recorded A:;ithout  orjjudies to the  eventual         Csbin.  t  decision on  the political  - questions involved         idemorandum should bo -orepared by the Secretary of State for Tar,

If I a:.a right in thinking that this ic the only outhori tativodecision yet arrived at, it would appear that the remark union Ihave quoted ic without; authority^ and that the viowa of the G. 0 * Oa&apos;are bein? sought on an erroneous premise,                                     VJ .i . 0 X ivrForeign 0ffioo,  S,,T. 12 6 tho.
