PERSIA.         On 8th necember Resht and Enzeli were bombed byaeroplanes from Kasvin;  one machine was forced to land inthe river bed 15 miles North East of Rustambad.         The Shah is known to be sending large sums  ofmoney abroad and it seems pretty certain that he is  making arrangements to leave Persia to her fate in the event ofBolshevik invasion or internal disorder.   His present intention is to revisit Europe in the spring and the probability is that he will not return from his journey.         With regard to the formation of a Persian Militaryftrce under British officers, Mr. Norman has been instructedto defer taking any action until the Medjliss meets and either accepts or rejects the Agreement which provides forthe formation of such amorce.

The British Vice Consulate  at Chios has been  closed.                  TURKEY.         The Turkish Government are still disinclined to ratify the peace treaty, in spite of the fact that they havoalready agreed to ratify as soon as Izzet Pasha has had anopportunity of discussing the situation with Mustafa Kemal,They plead the excuse that no news has been received fromAngora but t^ere is no doubt that, the mission reached that place some days ago.         It is evident, however, t*at the Turkish Governmentsee in the present Greek situation good grounds for hoping that a modification o^ the peace treaty will eventually bedecided upon, and are determined if possible to delayratification for that reason.         General Harington reports that the bulk of general wrangel!s array has gone on to Mudros and Gailipoli.   It isunderstood that Wrangel is keeping an array of some 40,000 to50,000 in being with a proportion of officers, the remainderbeing demobilised and put on half pay.

A \Q*  Mandate entitles Janan to apply her  own  lawsin the island.    These laws forbid foreigners to  operate acable station In the islands.
