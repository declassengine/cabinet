MANDATES FOR EAST  AFRICA.            Copy of letter  from  Mr.  Balfour  to Under  Secretary                            of State,  foreign Office.                                         British Delegation.                                            Hotftl Beau Rivage,                                               - Geneva,                                              16th De comber,  19 20.Sir,       Mr. Balfour thinks it may be of interest to Earl Curzon of kedleston to know the present position with regard to the Mandatesfor East Africa.       The form and the substance of the Mandates for East Africawas discussed in December, 1919* by the Supreme Council and agreed by that body.  Sinne then the substance of these Mandates has been regarded as settled, but no steps had been taken to acquaint  theBelgian Government with the successive changes of form desired byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, e*g. firstly the abandonment of a tJonven-tion requiring ratification, (the form adopted by the drafting committee in Paris) in faTour of a Declaration signed by the  parties and secondly, the abandonment of a signed Declaration in favour of  adecision of the Council of the League.  Mr.Balfour therefore  direct-ed me to approach M..Hymans, the first Belgian Delegate, and obtainhis concurrence in the submission &quot;to the Council of the Belgian Man-date in the same form as that adopted for the other Mandates.       As soon as I had an opportunity of seeing M&apos;.Hymans he  tele-graphed at once to Brussels for K.. Louwere., the Belgian GovernmentOfficial in charge- of the subject of Mandates, and when I took thematter up with that gentleman it became clear that the BelgianDelegates were aware of the negotiations with the French delegation on the subj-ect af&apos; the Mandates for Togo and the Camer*one.       M. Louvers made no difficulties about accepting the change
of form,  &quot;out asked me to  tell  him  the  terms  of the proposed Mandatesfor Togo and the Cameroons.    The  information which he gave meconvinced me that it  was  desirable that  I  should  explain to himfully for his confidential-information the  details of the proposed settlement with Prance, as  it&apos; is .clear that  ev*ry argument that thetwo Governments con use  in  their joint re commendation an justifyingthe special terms for the To so and Cameroons Mandates applies with greater force to the small  portion of  Sast Africa allotted to belgium.   The territory  is  very small  and  at one  time a large partof it was under Belgian  sovereignty.   H. Louwers  explained thatBelgian opinion would be  much moved if Belgium received a less favourable  type of Mandate than that  awarded to  France.  The  con-sideration, however,  which  is of  limportanoe to Great Britain, isthat the arguments employed in the joint  recommendation as to  -^ogoand the Cameroon will lose their  reality  if they are to receive no application in a case to  which they really apply  with even greaterforce9       As the result of  the conversation,  H. Louwers said that theBelgian Mandate for East  Africa would  not  be submitted until afterthe Franco-British recommendation  as to Togo and  the Cameroons hadbeen submitted and circulated to the Council.  A  Belgian draftwould then be prepared and  submitted &apos;*on the same lines.  He beggedfor an assurane-e that Great Britain would not  oppose the issue of  a mandate by the Council in the same terms  as  those adopted for  Togoand the Cameroons, and as I had had an opportunity of ascertainingMr.Balfour1 s views, this assurance was given him, but I urged  very strongly that the Belgians  should  not  ask for  the insertion  of thespecial provision as to  black troops,  whieh we  are bound to  give toFrance.                           I am                                 Sir,                             Your  obedient Servant,                                (Signed)   CFCIL   2.  B,  HURST.The Under Secretary of State,      Foreign Office.
