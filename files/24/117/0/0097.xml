Copy KTo. .c.  p.  2397.CABINET.             BRITISH REFUGESS FROM RUSSIA.           Memorandum by the Foreign Office.        The case of the British refugees who  have been repatriateed from Russia during the last year deserves  immediate attention^Over 1 thousand have arrived in England between April and december, and it is possible that some two  hundred more may comeduring the early months of next year.  These  persons are to avery large extent homeless and without friends from the time oftheir landing:  indeed had they had homes and friends in thiscountry it is reasonable to suppose that the  large majority ofthem would have left Russia in the early days of the Revolutionwhen everything possible was being done by. the British Embassy-and the various Consulates to induce them to  leave.        There are at present some 4j0 of them, men, women andchildren without employment or visible means  of support, andthis number will shortly increase, as about forty arrived lastweek from 3aku and about 60 are at present  in Finland waiting forsteamship facilities..   Many of them are persons who were well todo in Russia, but who .as a:result of the.chaotic state ofaffairs in that country are absolutely penniless on arrival here:especially as they are not permitted to bring with.them suchvaluables and moveable property as was left to them by theBolsheviks 0        As soon as repatriation on a fairly large scale                                                      began,
began&apos;, as &quot;a, result.-of the Litvinoff-0&apos; G-rady agreement,the National&quot; Relief::(late Prince of wales) Fund madea grant: of  30&apos;-;0.00 &quot;to-the Committee, which partly as aresult of an appeal &quot;from..Mr. 0&apos;Grady, had been set upto look after refugees- t  The.. Commit tee  became known asthe Trustees (Relief of British.Refugees from Russia)Fund, and consisted of Lord: Car nock, Mr. Cazalet, SirR. Perks, and Sir A. Spioer.   It  succeeded in hiringthe Holhorn Institute at Mitchair from the localauthorities and also a small hostel at Yiewsley ndarWest Drayton.   Its method of  procedure  was to meet thevarious parties of refugees at their  port of disembarka-tien, sort out the persons who had homes to which to gofrom those who had not, give the former  sufficientfunds to take them to their destination  and collect thelatter V:an:d ;move &quot;them-to - the:.home at Hit chain while the&quot;aged and&apos; sick  were-.sent.-. to-West Drayton.   There, everyattempt &quot;Was&quot;made: to. fl.nd-.employme.rrt for  them and tobring them Into  contact., with possible employers, partlythrough a so called &apos; Care- Committee!.  under the  chairman-ship &apos;of&quot;Lord-Addington.   As,  however, t it was  not possibleto board&apos;them  all  at Hitcham,  many were  scattered aboutand  given &quot;weekly grant s--by  the Committee though  naturallythe se: grant s - we re.  not. very  1 arge.       &apos; Lord  Carn-stock  -estimated thcat the  expenditure,including Establishment -and overhead  charges,  was  in                                           December
                            o  ** 3)60ember about   600  per  week  and  in view of the exhaustion  of tho grant  from  the -national -Relief Fund warnod  the  Foreign Offioo that he would have to  - olose down  his  organisation at the end of December (i.e. on  the 27th)&quot;.  Tho Secretary of the National Relief  Fund was approached both by Lord  Oarnook and by  tho  Foreign Office but stated that it was &apos; impossibleto make any further grant.   Tho Foreign Offioo  therefore.approached the Treasury, urging tho grant of  a  contribution from public funds to ths organisation run.by Lord Garnook.     This appeal was justified by stating that the condition of the refugees themselves5  having oome from Russia, was without precedent: that (apart from&apos; all questions of humanity) it would be&apos; unwise and discreditable to allow those persons to become utterly destitute,  because the whole of the negotiations had taken place, before the public eye, firstly through mr.. CGrady and secondly as a preliminary to the re- opening of  trade: and that there had been practically no response to the first publio appeal-for sub-^ sorlptions  towards their maintenance.    Cn  the  understanding that some grant would bemadOj Lord  Oarnook-was induced to keep up his organiza tion until  January lstrbut in the reply given by the Treasury  to the Foreign Office on Deoember 21st a grant from  publio funds was promised subject only to  ; Cabinet sanction and subject to tho proviso that the National  Relief Fund would contribute at least an equivalent  amount *                                            As
      As Sir Geerge Hurray, tho Secretary of the,National Relief Fund has e.xp lioiily. stated that heis unable to&quot;allocate any further sum for the purpose -in&apos;question it Would seem imperative .to waive this latter condition and to make a definite and final&apos;grant from public funds to Lord Carnock, to be administered In conjunction with the Ministry ofHealth.- As the Russian refugees are precluded fromenjoying any of the benefits under the UnemploymentInsurance Act, it seems only equitable that special steps should be taken to meet their difficulties moreparticularly as a large proportion of them have heavyclaims against the Russian Government which they are quite unable to realize either now or: in the immediatefuture.  Lurd Carnoek&apos; is viilling&apos; to&apos;continue to serve in an honorary:&apos; cap a city&apos;1 and keep his organization^pen provided that&apos;funds are forthcomings-      Every  effort Is being made to secure  employment&apos;both through the Ministry  of Labour and  the Federationof British  Industries^ but until those who&apos;can be9. arefinally  absorbed it will be in  every way desirable  tnlet trie  refugees be looked after for a definite period^as it  is on them and on others,  like  them thatreliance may chiefly have  to be placed when practicalefforts  are made once  again to&quot;&apos; open up Russia  totrade  and  commerce.-FOREIGN OFFICE,&quot;     December 27th, 1920.-
