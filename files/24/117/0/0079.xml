Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.    I circulate, for convenience, a set completed up to date of the telegrams between sir Percy Cox and myself in regard to the possibilities of reduction in Mesopotamia.                                                                    E. S. M.    29th December 1920.            From Secretary of State to Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia,                               1st December 1920.    Private.  I am very reluctant to trouble you with financial difficulties in midst ofyour other  urgent  preoccupations.   But situation here is really serious in  view of universal and often unreasoning demand for economy in  all directions, and I foreseegreat difficulty in securing continued  support for our Mesopotamiau policy either from Parliament  or from  my  colleagues in  the Cabinet unless I can  hold out tothem some assured prospect of progressive retrenchment.  It would greatly assist meif you could estimate roughly what  is smallest number of troops. British and Indian,with which you think  it would be possible  to carry on during next financial yearprovided, general  conditions  do  not appreciably  deteriorate,  and   what  further reductions can be made each succeeding year.   You need not be afraid that you willbe held irrevocably to your estimate, however, circumstances may alter.  I shall at all times clo my  best to see that  your requirements are properly  supplied.  But  it isessential that I should be able  to state at present juncture what is absolute minimum of military force required  for  Mesopotamia supposing all goes well and you are incomplete civil and. military control, i.e., minimum without Avliich it would be uselessfor us to stay in the country or persevere with policy of nursing Arab State through its non-age.   Would it be possible to concentrate for the present and re-establish ourposition in outlying  districts as the  native army develops ?  Mesopotamia is nowcosting  us  over 30,000,000?. a year.   Could you make a forecast as to smallest sum required next year?  An urgent reply is required.     I  do not telegraph officially for this only expresses a desire for a rough idea ofyour views for the immediate assistance of Cabinet.              From High Commissioner, Baghdad, 8th December 1920.    Private.   Your private telegram of 2nd December.    Para.  1. Accepting  assumptions and provisoes stated in your telegram, and onunderstanding that necessary shipping facilities will  be forthcoming, I anticipate that by  31st March 1921  it should be  possible to reduce  garrison to strength given inWar  Office  telegram 86763 D.M.O.,  dated  1st   November  1920, addressed  toGeneral  Headquarters : Infantry Divisions two, Cavalry Brigade one, and line ofcommunication  battalions  exclusive  of  troops in  North-West Persia.    further reduction of  this force will depend  on successful  creation of a new MesopotamianArmy, and. I hope that gradual recruitment of this  army will  be as  follows: By(? 7th September) 1921, 4,000;  by April 1922, 6,500; by  October  1922, 10,000;  by april 1923, 15,000;  provided that always financial  provision is forthcoming.  Thesefigures  are exclusive of existing  levies, whose numbers are being raised  graduallyto sanctioned strength, 5,000..  The progressive creation of these forces should enable us to dispense with one brigade in October 1921, and thereafter to  make progressivereductions until by April  1923 there would be in the country only one British division.It is conceivable that if things progress very well that we  may find ourselves able todo with less, but I do not  think  it would be  safe at  present to contemplate reductionbelow (? a) division.  Mesopotamia (? must)  always be &quot; Iraq (? Irredenta) &quot; to Turk(two  corrupt, groups), and  until  Turkish  are effectively  (? expelled)  a national government, unsupported by foreign troops, would be unlikely to survive.     Para. 2. These figures  are  designed to, give  effect to a policy  of concentrationpursued to a point at which further  concentration would invite attack.   Thus duringcoming  hot  weather there  will be  no British  troops between NaSiriyah and Hillah,troops being concentrated at  Basrah, Baghdad,  Mosul and Kirkuk (? with) garrisons      3020    100  12.20
at Amara, Kut  and Hillah, and  Dlihvhat.au and  Jhmiadi Hit only.   T hope (? tomaintain) order between Nasiriyah and  llillah  by a force of  Aral) local levies, baseSamawah, and for other vacant areas to trust to mobile columns maintained  at  points of concentration.   It will not be practicable to reduce still further or to leave areasaltogether beyond reach of troops, because; in connection  with present Turkish andother menaces,  areas  abandoned would, probably  be  occupied  by  actively hostileelement.     Para. 3. I  have  not available  the  figures of cost  which would  enable meaccurately to estimate precise value of these reductions to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin pounds sterling. In Mesopotamia!! budget for current [? financial) year, a provisionof between forty and fifty  lakhs  has  been made on account of levies.   It is hoped toprovide 120 lakhs on local  military forces including  levies in 1921-22, and  .150 lakhsin succeeding year.     As far as can be estimated  at&apos; present, these allotments should cover the cost oflocal forces raised at rate  of progression  described in  para. 1 in addition to 5,000levies.  If recruits are forthcoming at a higher rate than that indicated above, it wouldbe for His Majesty^ Government  to consider advisability of advancing funds to  enableMesopotamian Army to be  brought to its maximum strength in  a shorter  time thanthat at present contemplated.   In this connection, it is obvious that  net comparativecost of local forces would be.considerably below  that of  equivalent British  troops, as not only wages will be much less, but overseas transport and collateral services  willbe saved.  Unfortunately until the (V present) Government is replaced by a permanentconstitution, it may be difficult to fix exact terms of service  for  National Army, andconsequently to calculate man power represented by 150 lakhs.     Another difficulty is fact that overhead  charges do  not decrease proportionatelywith reduction in  strength.    But  as  against  this  the scheme  outlined  abovecontemplates,  according to existing military view, reduction first in outlying districts,so that  most  expensive units  to  maintain could be  withdrawn first.   It presentaverage cost of force be accepted as a basis then calculates of progress of reduction ofexpenditure could probably be estimated by War Office.     Para. I.-1  wish,  however,  to  emphasise following point.  The provision olfunds, which, as explained above,  it is hoped to make during ensuing financial vears.will curtail desirable expenditure  on  Civil. Departments and  on  development  of thecountry.   Every item  brought about  will have  to  be   (? greatly) scrutinised.  but while it  will be within  the power of National Government to check any extravagancein civil expenditure, in the case of military expenditure  the situation will be entirely different, as National Government will not possess the same right  to scrutinise orcriticise  it, but  they will at any  rate  be  entitled  to feel  assured  that military expenditure is also administered  with views of economy.   I. assume that union  ofcivil and military control which you foreshadow in your  telegram  will connote the appointment of a competent Financial Adviser whose duty it will be to  advise  me on military expenditure.   If that  development  is Jikely to take time, I suggest  that  a committee should be appointed by General Officer commander-in-Chief in consultation with me, to which I would  depute a representative.  In  making this suggestion of (sic) I particularly does (sic) not wish it be (? thought) that I am prejudicing the question of military  expenditure  in Mesopotamia,  but I  have noticed  since  my  arrival  in connection with occasional allusions in newspapers or telegrams to heavy  burdens  at. present laid upon British taxpayer (two corrupt groups) that their (? there) exists  in minds of leaders of opinion here both in Council and outside at high cost  of present military regime as judged by light of their own standard, and it would be easier to secure co-operation of National Government in  making largest possible contribution of military expenditure if 1  were at all  events  in  a  position to assure  them that aggregate account was not unduly swollen by avoidable expenditure.            From Secretari] of State to High Commissioner, Mesopotamia,                               17&apos;th December 1920.    Private.  Your private telegram of 8th December, which please show Haldaneif  you have not  done so.   The War Office estimates that your proposals will cost about 25,000,000Z.-in the next  financial year, and that no immediate  hope of a  speedyfinancial relief is anticipated.  This is apart from any deficit on civil working, which
                                       oI hope will be avoided.  In the House of  Commons on Wednesday no one suggested the abandonment of our mandate or complete withdrawal from Mesopotamia.    On the other hand, the proposal is made by War Office, and is under consideration,that we should withdraw to Basra  with a  frontier Ahwaz, Kurna, Nasirieh, or some such line.  .The suggestion is that  in this position one could be secure with a division,and that you could hold this without abandoning the mandate over the whole territoryalready defined, including the  Mosul Vilayet,  leaving  the  Arab  Government  at baghdad to administer the territory.  If  you  have any observations to offer on thisscheme I  should be glad  to have them,  or, alternatively, will you  try to  devise ascheme which would be no more expensive?            From. High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, lo Secretary of State,                              20th December 1920.     101: S.  Private.   Your private telegram of 17th instant.   My  telegram  of  SthDecember was  sent after conference with  Chief  of the General  Staff on behalf ofGeneral Commanding-in-Chief, and draft  was accepted by  him before despatch.Simultaneously with  your present telegram  to me,  telegram  has  reached GeneralCominahding-in-Chief  from  the War Office making same  suggestion  in more livelyform.   Secretary  of State for War even seems to think that proposal can begin totake  shape  at once.   General  Officer Commanding and I  are of  opinion that.whereas withdrawal to line indicated might be possible two years hence, propositionis not a practical one for the present purpose.     In  my judgment,  if Ave  retired to the  line indicated, we should be quite unableto fulfil terms of mandate either in respect of our obligation to  League of  nations or to the people  of  this country.  It  would  mean  leaving  infantile  national government with  a grave menace looming from  the north entirely  without  meansof protecting their frontiers or maintaining internal order.  In existing circumstances it would  involve withdrawal of all. Indian labour and the consequent abandonment of railways, and closing  down of  present  technical  organisations.    It would  alsoentail simultaneous withdrawal of practically  Avhole of  British personnel  north of line, as  I can hardly imagine any would consent  to remain if such be the policy ofMis Majesty&apos;s Government.     If  we are to  accept  mandate, I can suggest  no alternative scheme  which itwould be possible to  put into operation until peace with Turkey has been  ratifiedand Kemalists and Bolsheviks  have  ceased  to be a menace.   Such  a  satisfactorysituation  can  hardly  be expected  at  all  events  before  next autumn.   When itdoes  come,  it  seems to me, as a layman, that  some  reduction might  be possible onthe two divisions  by concentrating our  main force in Baghdad and beyond,  and merely  safeguarding our communications behind  us.  Externally  it is from the northand internally from Baghdad that  trouble  is likely to start,  and,  as regards  Basrahor the oilfields, we can always act promptly from India.     I believe that if the War Office proposal, with all it involves, were accepted now,we should before  long either  have  to  withdraw  altogether or&apos;reconquer country in front of us.  In any case, I would repeat that the intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to submit the mandate to the League  of Nations in the immediate futureseems to be  fundamentally incompatible with the adoption  of such a  policy as that suggested.            From Secretary of Slate to High Commissioner, Mesopotamia,                              2tth December 1920.    Private.   Your private telegram 104 S.  I suppose you have seen General OfficerCommanding^ telegram  of 21st December,  X.  945.  Presumbly views  thereinexpressed are  based on purely military considerations, and did not take into accountpolitical  aspects of withdrawal.  I understand  from you that General  Officer  Com-manding agrees with you that immediate withdrawal to Basra Vilayet is  incompatible with execution of mandate in Baghdad and Mosul Vilayets.    Please telegraph your remarks  on  General  Officer Commanding^ telegramgenerally, but especially on paras.  3 and  5.   As regards para. 3, what would beimmediate political effect of evacuation?   Do you suppose Turks would return, and,if  so, would they be welcome ?  If they would  not  be, how would peace conditions
postulated  in  para. 4 be  secured ?  In any case,  what would  be Turkish  attitudetowards our continued presence in Basra  Vilayet ?   As regards para.  5,  can you suggest means for protection of Mosul, Baghdad  and other towns against looting andmassacre ?   Please reply clear the line.    From High Commissioner, Baghdad, to Secretary of Stale, 21th December 1920.     Clear the line.     (R.)  124 B.  Your telegram, 26th, clear the line.   Had I  seen General Officer&apos; Commanding^ telegram X. 945 before your message reached me, my general comment would have been that it was academic reply to War Office enquiry based on abstract military considerations and  false hypothesis, and  ignoring (? the more) (? concrete) non-military factors.  General Officer  Commanding (who is away to-day) no  doubt took for granted that those  facts  would  be represented  by me, but it  will be noted that he took precautions to close his telegram with reservation that his programme was based on assumption that  peaceful conditions would prevail,  assumption  which is in no way warranted in actual  circumstances.  1. am aware  that General Officer Com- mancling is  fully (corrupt  group) effect and consequences of such  a  line of action as- that for which  he was asked to  submit programme, and  his views  cannot differ materially from mine.   1 request that War Office may be pressed to call for them.     Contents  of my telegrams Nos. 104 S., 119 S., seem to supply sufficient comment upon proposal as a whole, and as I regard programme [is  based on  false  promises, [ cannot  usefully  comment  on  details, but 1.  would  offer  additional observation that retirement from  Mosul would, in existing circumstances, appear to involve  either extermination  of twelve or fifteen thousand Christian refugees now under our care there, or alternatively their transportation  to a British Colony in front of  us.   If the voice of nation insists on immediate evacuation, no protest on the part of  my humble self will be  of any avail, but it is  difficult to  understand how the  proposal can bear examination by an intelligent and honourable body of one&apos;s  countrymen  fully seized of the facts.    I realise, however, that question is hanging in the balance, and am fain to believe some further  concession(s) to  (corrupt group) for economy may turn  the scale.  In this hope I offer following  suggestion which I believe, in the circumstances, would be acceptable.    If the present Provisional Government continues to function, or if ruler is chosenfrom iuside  Irak, I do not think  that we should be warranted in hoping for any quicker progress  of  reduction than  that already offered  by me, i.e., reduce  to one division by end of two years.   But Shereef  Faisal would  be in a position to raiseNational Army  quicker than any candidate  from Irak,  and, if  he became  King at once, I believe his coming would in (? a week) serve to  satisfy national sentiment (? for) year or  two, and  (? keep) country contented, so that  in those circumstances believe that within one year I should expect to reduce the Army  of  Occupation to one division for  Baghdad and Mosul Vilayets, and one  brigade to be  distributed between Amara and Kurina, Nasiriyeh  and  Basrah.  That  will  reduce the bill considerably.  Failing Faisal, Zaid might serve this purpose as a last resort.  I beg- that this proposal be  placed  before  War Office, and General Officer Commanding, asked for his views.    Your first telegram on this subject dated 1st December 1920 was sent private in order not to commit me to a final  view, but that consideration no longer applies, andI  beg that  this  correspondence  from  beginning of  May  now be made official, and given all publicity permissible.            From High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, 27th December 1920.     Private and personal.   My immediately preceding telegram.   In case you maywonder at my not having commented immediately, it  seems necessary to inform you.personally that  contents of General Officer  Commanding^ telegram were not eom-municated to me until I asked  for it on receipt of  your telegram of 21st December ;but I am assured that it was an unintentional omission, and therefore do not wish itcommented upon.
       Telegram from High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, 24ih December 1920.    11.9 S.  Private.  My telegram No. 104 S.  dated  20th December.  I would  add that in the event of withdrawal of our troops  before some other organised force  was ready to replace them, there would clearly be  nothing to stop  the  Turks,  and the lives and property of the natives of the country who have co-operated with us wouldbe in the greatest danger, and  our premature withdrawal could only bo regarded bythem as a  simple betrayal.      Telegram from High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, 29th December 1920.                         (Repeated to Foreign, Delhi.)                             (Received 30th, 8 a.m.)    Clear the line,    15339 Almis.  British Chamber  of Commerce are to-day telegraphing followingresolutions to Secretary of Associated Chambers, London, for action and  support: &quot; The British Chamber of Commerce, Baghdad, respectfully begs to  direct (? again)the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Chambers  resolution  dated  27thJuly 1920.   Chamber has since noticed with the deepest concern the  clamour whichhas arisen in the Home Press for the immediate evacuation of the whole or the  greaterportion  of Mesopotamia, and reading in Reuter&apos;s  telegrams just received that thisclamour has found an echo in Parliament, wishes once more to represent and emphasiseits views on the certain  results  of  hasty  evacuation.  No one with experience inMesopotamia can for a moment doubt that the results would be massacres, destructionof property, and general anarchy extending not only over the whole region evacuatedbut also over adjacent countries, one of the consequences  being  the loss to GreatBritain  of  a flourishing and  growing trade.  The Chamber strongly  contests theidea that the solution of  the  problem  is  to  be found  in the retention  of theprovince of  Basra.   This  would   be  splitting  the country into  two,  and  theBasra  Province  could  only  then  be  held  as  fortified  area,  an  area  withoutany  natural defences  or boundaries, the inhabitants of which would be speedilyinfected  by  the  anarchy reigning in the  country evacuated.  The  Chamber fails to understand by what right Great  Britain having evaded  her responsibility in thenorthern territory could forcibly retain the province of Basra.   Chamber of Commercepoints out  that  the British  forces  by  their occupation of Mesopotamia destroyed the only form of Government the country had known for  centuries, and that  evacua-tion at the present time will  leave it without any Government worthy of the name.Thus the final result of British intervention in Mesopotamia would  be its completeruin,  for  which  the responsibility will  rest on Great Britain.  The Chamber fullyrecognises the urgent  need  of lightening the  burden on  the  British taxpayer, andbelieves that this can be attained with safety and honour along the lines as at present contemplated and  inaugurated  by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.    The Chamber,however,  ventures to express opinion that large economies  could be effected immecli-ately by  drastic reductions  in Military Department,  which  appears to be  out  ofall proportion to the requirements even of the  present combatant Army Departments,whose activities are not confined  to military needs.   The  Chamber  respectfully(? prays) His Majesty&apos;s Government to hold steadfastly to the policy of establishing a stable Amh Government thus fulfilling  the solemn pledges repeatedly given to thopeople of the country.&quot;
