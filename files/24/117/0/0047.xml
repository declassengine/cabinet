Paraphrase of a telegram from the Governor of Western                  Australia to the Secretary of State for the                  Colonies.             (Received Colonial Office 5.18 p.nu 21st December,1920).                               In  north-west Western. Australia a  serious                     conflict  has  occurred between  the Japanese of(*mixed              Broome, one thousand strong, and  Koepangers:  s e af ar ins  population         apparently white  men are  also  involved.  It  is  mostly Malays)          ,  ,  .       .                 ,     n     ,   *       J     J        reported  xn evening newspapers that  the British  of                     Broome  demand the deportation  of Japanese as being  (^several          detrimental,   The pearl  industry  .  .      .  .    undecipherable)   mU3&quot;^ aggravate the situation.   The  towns are                     being guarded by  returned soldiers,  and practically                     all white residents have  been  sworn  in as special                     constables.   My Premier has  asked the  Commonwealth                     Prime Minister to send a  man-of-war, but  so  far                     no answer has been received.  If not presumptuous,                     might I suggest privately that a British man-of-                     war might visit Broome quickly, as  if  in  ordinary                     routine,  if  one is in neighbourhood  ?  Unless                     situation is  carefully watched, it  is  difficult                     to know what  may  happen.   Several deaths  are                     reported.  I  have telegraphed  to  the Governor                     General of Australia.NEWDEGATE,
