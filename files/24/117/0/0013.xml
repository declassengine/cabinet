Note  by the Secretary of  State  of India,          After the pledgee that  have been made to      Sir Percy  Con, and efter the  Statement of  the Prime      Minister yesterday,  I weald  urge that the  India Office      should  now be  relieved of responsibility for  the Civil      Government of  Mesopotamia.   The responsibilities  of      this Office are too great to continue with this Immense      task and I am  prepared to hand over tomorrow  to any      Department selected for the  work.    Evon if partial      evacuation is  decided upon the policy will be so out  of      harmony with the work which  we have been doing, so      contrary to the advice that  we have given, that it had      better  be  carried out under  the auspices of some other      Office,                           (Intel)   E0ScMg    &apos;  India Office.          December 16th, 1920.
