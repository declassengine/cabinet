This Document Is thn Pvonerb! of      I present herewith to my colleagues in the Cabinet the promised Bill dealing with Key Industries and Dumping, which is now in three main parts, the flrat relating to Key Industries, the seoond to Dumping and the third to Collapsed Exchanges,      The first part of the measure, which deals with the safe- guarding of Key Industries, is of the utmost urgency as I am( convinced that there is no chanoo of the weak Key Industries being developed and eon duo ted with enterprise, or even in some oases maintained at their present level until they know definite- ly. what support thoy are to receive, .  A separate measure for the. safeguarding of the dye-making industry in this oountry from the effects of unrestricted importation of foreign (especially German) dyes, which was Introduced on account of the specially critical position of tne dye-making industry and to redeem the pledge, of  His Majesty1 s Government that such imports would he controlled-hy a system of prohibition and licence for a period of 10 years after; the war, has now. booomo I*wV&apos;   But there are other industries which, though they havo perhaps attracted less - - public, ^ttentionj. are.in a similar position of uncertainty and entitled; to., similar support,, . It is, for instance, only  with difficulty that makers of optical glass, which is of the highest importanca.to the. country in time of war, can be persuaded to keep their works going.      The second part of the measure deals with damping.Although dumping, in the strict sense is not rife at present and noarly-ail the complaints which have been received recently with regard to the effect oniemployment in this country of unrestricted imports of goods -at abnormally low, prices relate to the competition of gb&amp;ds of which the sale prico hore is low owing to tho state... of the exchanges of the countries of oidgin, the safeguarding of Industries  B11.memorandum by the President of tho Board of grade
fall in price of certain commodities  which is  now in progressmay at any time gauge foreign holders of stooks to disposo  ofthem on a largo saale in this country at a dumping price, andthe fear of this is spreading.   An anti-dumping measure would therefore help to restore confidence.   Wo are, of coursecommitted by the Coalition manifesto to the safe guarding of key Industries and to tho prohibition of dumping,     The question of dealing with collapsed exchange is probablytho most difficult presented by the Bill,   She numerous Questionswhich are being asked on this subject in the House of Commonsare an index of the widespread uneasiness and disorganisationproduced by the importation of cheap goods from collapsed exchangeoountries, and from a voluminous correspondence which I havereceived from  numerous  industries affected by competition ofthis character I have come to the clear  conviction that a sformof protest would arise  wore I to introduoe a measure dealingwith dumping in the strict sense if  it  did not deal also with the problem presented by the  importation of these  cheap  goods.                       &quot;gjg  INDUS     It is proposed  to  protect a limited list  of  Key industries for  a period of 5  years by subjecting thoir produots to an ad valorem duty of 23 l/3 per cent,  on  importation  into thiscountry, such  duties being in addition  to  any  imposed underthi  other parts of the  present Bill.  .  The partucular groups of articles whose  importation is thus to be subjected to dutyare  set out in the Schedule to the Bill.     The alternative to the  imposition  of  duties  is  prohibitionof importation exoept undor licence,  a  course  whioh has beenadopted in respect of Synthetic Dyeetuffs,   The  discussions in  the Houea of Commons and in the Standing Committee whichconsidered the Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Bill havo,
however, made it olear that there is a wide-spread dislike of the licensing system on accountof the delays and inequities as between individualconsumers to which it may give rise, and it mustbe admitted that in the case of most of the Kayindustries dealt with in the present measure itwould be exceedingly difficult if not Impossible towork a lioensing system, - producers and consumersor beth being so numerous and so largely unorganised.In addition there would be prolonged discussion overattempts to lay down the constitution of a LicensingCommittee for every commodity&apos;included in the Schedule.Whilst, in the case of Dyestuffs, the producers andiireot consumers are so organised that It is possibleto constitute a Licensing Committee with oomparativelylittle difficulty, this does not apply to all theother trades concerned in the commodities Included inthe Schedule.   From the administrative point of view,protection by means of duties is much the simplestcourse, and from-the point of view of the trades con-concerned It has the advantage of simplicity and certainty.                     PUMPING.     In this Bill, as in previous proposals for dealingwith this question, the Anti-dumping provisions relateoniy to scheduled goods.   When, as a result of an enquiry, it is demonstrated that dumping of any classof goods is taking place to a damaging extent the Boardof Trade are required to schedule these goods.    But
whereas in tho Bill introduced in 1919-provision-was made for&quot;the payment on,-scheduled-- goods ofan anti-dumping duty equivalent to any excess offoreign value over the price realised in this country,the present Bill imposes no duty but makes thedumping of Scheduled goods a punishable offence.Consequently,.the strong objection taken to theold Bill on the ground of its imposing a variablecharge to be assessed by tho Board of Trade doesnot apply to the present Bill, which moreover, isin many respects simplor to administer.     I would call attention to. the fact that rfhere-as the provisions In the Bill with regard to leyIndustries and collapsed exchanges are intended to beof a temporary character and to romain in force for five and three years respectively, the provision?withregard to dumping are of the nature of permanent legislation,                COLLAPSED EXCEA.II6BS.     In this Bill, the Collapsed Exchange provisionsarc to apply only to the ex-enemy countries taken  enbloc, and only to certain descriptions of goods im-ported from those countries.  In tho first place,  itis preposod that they should apply at once to all goods in the Schedule to the Key Industries portionof tho Bill.   The necessity for adequate protection for these particular industries is regarded asestablished.   They arc very largely-German special!-ties and competition resulting from the depredation ofthe German exchanges has therefore to be met at once in
their ease by speoial measures.   As regards  other goods  itis proposed to deal with each oase as It arises by aspecial enquiry.   When as a result of an enquiry by aCommittee appointed under the provisions of the Bill it isdemonstrated (1) that goods of any class made In one ofthese countries are being imported into the United kingdom at prices which owing to the state of the exchange are lcwerthan those at which similar goods oan be produced here,and (2) that as a result of this Importation employmentin any Industry in the United- Kingdom is being seriously affected, the Board of Trade are required to aohedule thegoods9   Goods so scheduled become subject to a collapsedexchange duty on importation, and this duty, it is suggested.whilst depending to some extent on the degree to whichthe currency of enemy States Is depreciated, should not In any event exceed two-thirds of the value of the goods.   It is       1proposed that this duty should be levied whenever the Mark falls(as it has fallen at present) below  Id In value.   Only                              ta duty of such magnitude as this could be depended uponto check the fleod of German goods produced and marketedunder the present collapsed exchange condition.   The de-proclation of the German exchange Is taken as the index of the duty to be levied on the goods, because it is                           Ialmost wholly in respeot of German  imports that an effeoton employment In this country  Is to  be feared.     Theduty     only need be made  applicable to  imports from other lateenemy  countM-es .ln order to avoid the possibility that Germanmanufacturers will set  up  ^r secure  control  over works in such countries with  a view to  escaping any duty applicable  only toGorman geoda.   The  depreciation   in the Aiutri&amp;ft  exchange,,for  example,  Is no measure of  the real  risks  that have to be
  met.       The  Bill  of  last  year  gavo  the  Board  of  Trade  power  to  impose o  countervailing  duty  varying from  time  to time  according to circumstances  asoertained by  the Separtmont,  and was  severely  oritioised  on  the  ground  that It  placed  in  the hands of an administrative Department  the power  to  impose  Import duties  on foreign goods fixed without referenue  to.  Parliament.    From the point of  view of giving security to  trade,  there  is  much  to  be said  for a  fixed duty  irrespective of  tho  state  of  exchange.  On the other hand it  would be manifestly  inadvisable  to impose  a duty so  high as fe6 2/3 per cent were  the value of the  Mark  to  improve so  much  that any  advantage to  Germany  resulting from Collapse  of  exchange disappeared.   In  order  to  get over the  difficulty of  a continually  fluctuating  duty,  whilst at  the same  time meeting this criticism,  it is  proposed  that, in the  event (which  is perhaps hardly likely)  of  the Mark  increasing substantially in value, the duty on  all  scheduled  goods from ex-enemy countries shall  decrease  by,definite  steps according to  a determined schedule.  The  steps should  be few in  number in order that importers  may be in a  position to forecast with sufficient accuracy  what1 the duty will in fact be.       These  Duty provisions  are  designed  to operate for a  period of three  years.       The object of the measure,  in regard  to  goods other  than those  produced by Key  Industries, being  to prevent un-  employment in and damage to British Industries as  a result of  the adventitious competition dependent upon collapsed exchanges   it is obviously  undesirable to  apply the  duty to  goods  which are not shown------&quot;                &apos;---
 to menace British industries and this  can only be  ascertained by inquiry.   It is impossible to forecast in advance  which industries are  likely to  he  threatenedj  though evidence  has already been reoeived from o number  of  trades  (e.g. hosiery, gloves,  toys, musical instruments, leather etc) suggesting the  existence of  a prime  facie  case  which would  justify  sub- mission to a Committee.        It should  be stated that  complaints of  the  effects of collapsed exchange have been made in regard  not only  to  the ex-enemy countries but also  to  certain Allied  countries, in some  cf which  (notably, Italy, France,  Belgium and  Portugal) the  exchange is also  much  depreciated, - though  not  nearly so seriously as in the case of  the  ex-enemy  countries or certain of the  smaller Allies, viz.  Poland,  roumania,  Jugo Slavia etc. It should be noted, however,  that the danger against  whioh protection is sought  is greater  in the case  of Germany than of our Allies because of the  continuously  depressing  influence which reparation payments will exert on the  German exchanges. Moreover  the difficulties  of  legislating against the Allied countries  are so formidable  as to be virtually insuperable.        However generally a  clause might be worded so as to apply not  to any one country in particular, but  to all countries whose exchange  has depreciated, it would still conflict with the extremely  specific provisions of -certain of our Commercial treaties.  Thus Article II of the Anglo-Italian Commercial Treaty of  1883 provides that  &quot;No other or higher duties shall be imposed on the  importation in the Dominions and  Possessions of Her Britannic Majesty of any article the produce or manu- facture of the dominions or possessions of His Majesty theKing of Italy from whatever place arriving. ..., than on artioles
produced or manufactured in any other country&quot;.  Roumania, Serbiaand Portugal all have similar provisions in their Treatieo,end Belgium has a provision which, though couched in moregonoral terms, would undoubtedly onr-itlo her to most-favoured-nation treatment in the matter of customs duties.  Whilstthoreforo it would, of courno, bo possible to impose a dutyon goods from all countries alike, no duty could be imposed on o.g. Italian goods of any description unless an identicalduty were imposed on tho same goods of Swiss or other neutralorigin.    We havo no Commercial Treaty with Prance whichentitles tho latter to claim moat-favoured-nation troatmontin regard to Customs duties, but in fact Franco extends most-favoured-nation treatment to British goods because she rocoivesvery favourablo treatment in this country.  Most of the treaties namod can only be terminated at IS months&apos; notice,the arrangement with Belgium at 3 months notice and thePortuguese Treaty not before 1925.     Also, apart from those Troaty difficulties it would bea questionable policy for the United Kingdom to adopt any kindof discrimination against.Alliod oountrios since they could and undoubtedly would hit back.   Wo should run a  serious riskof finding ourselves involvod in a war of Tariffs, and it isworth pointing out that if we entered upon such a  course  in thocase of France, whoro no  troaty obstacle stands in the way, we should be staking tho profits of a vory  substantial tradeIn the first  0 months of  1915&apos;our  imports from Franco amountedin value to nearly  35-J- million and  our  exports to France  intho same period amounted  to  only  .322 million,  (or  omittingcoal to  16 million).      Today  the  position  is reversod.We imported from France  in  tho corresponding period of 1920
(9) 60.3 million and we exported to her  108 million (oromitting coal,  75 million).  Germany (against whom themeasure is  principally directed) oannot, under the Treaty ofVersailles, rotaliate for a period of at least 5 years fromthe date of its coming into force.     It would, moreover, on politioal and sentimental groundsho extremely difficult to take any action which would have theappearance of penalising tho trade of the most hard hit of our allies.  The Bill of 1919 was so worded as to give a discrotionin this regard.  Whilst during the war wo contemplated thepossibility of discrimination against neutrals after the war infavour of our Allies, and oven gave them notice generally thatwe might find it necessary to do so, offering them the opportun-ity, if they wished, of denouncing their Commercial treaties with the United Kingdom, no one ever dreamt of an arrangement under whioh imports from our Allios would be subject to higherdutios than corresponding imports from neutral countries.
