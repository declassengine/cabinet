PART  M -THE   LABOUR  SITUATION.THE  GENERAL  SITUATION. General Survey of the Week.     The principal dispute in progress at the end of last week, namely, the strike of shipyard joiners against a reduction in wages, has continued with little change during the week under review;  and no important addition to the number of disputes in progress has occurred. Attention may be drawn to the further progress of negotiations with regard to wages and conditions of work in the engineering and shipbuilding industries, and the important and successful meeting between representatives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Council of Port  Labour Employers to discuss  matters  arising out of the report of Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry.   On the other hand, the position with regard to tramwaymen and electrical power engineers continues to be threatening, and a general feature of the industrial situation is the refusal of employers, because of the pronounced depression in trade, to  countenance demands for increased wages, very naturally put forward by  the workers  on the ground of the increased  cost of living. Except in a few special cases, however, the suggestions made for reduction in  wages, principally in the building trades, appear to bear the character of tactical moves in response to applications. for increases coming from the other side.     There is little to be said with regard to the more political aspects of the Labour move- ment.  The  Labour  Joint Commission of Inquiry have concluded their activities in Ireland, and a deputation representing the Parliamentary Committee oi the Trades Union Congress and the Parliamentary Labour Party will be received by the Minister of Labour on the 16th and will make representations with regard to the unemployment&apos; position. Generally speaking, it may be said that the national bodies representing labour  are far more diffident now, as compared with the summer of this  year,  in  enunciating lines of policy which the Government should pursue.     The Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment)  Bill received its second reading in the House of Lords on the 9th December, and passed through its remaining stages in that House on the 14th.  Drafting amendments only have been made, and  when these have be^n agreed to by the House of Commons, the Bill will be ready for the.Royal Assent.   The Ministry  of  Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill passed the  House of Commons on the 9th November, but failed to secure its second reading in the House of Lords on the 14th.FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.- General Topics.      Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. To meet the existing distress among unemployed  workers not at present covered by the Act, it has been suggested that special arrangements  should be made to assist workers who were uninsured and unemployed on the 8th Novem-  ber.   The London County Council Special Committee on Unemployment have urged that  the following plan should be adopted:  &quot;All persons now unemployed (and who were  bona fide in  employment.for not less than 12 weeks during the year previous to the 8th  November, 1920) should be entitled to a minimum  of 8 weeks unemployment benefit,  during the year from November, 1920, to November, 1921, irrespective of the amount  contributed.   Those  already entitled to the same, or a longer, benefit under any of the  existing schemes  would receive the amount to which they were entitled ; those who were  entitled to two or three weeks would have the amount made up to eight, while those who  were entitled to  nothing would also receive  eight weeks.&quot;  It  is maintained that the  method of financing such a proposal is not difficult in theory, as it is proposed that the cost  of raising unemployment pay for all to a minimum of  eight weeks during the ensuing year  should be debited to the central Unemployment Fund and be paid off over a term of years.
     Proposals on these lines have been favourably considered in many quarters and,  inparticular, have been put forward by a deputation from the National Alliance of Employersand Employed, received by the Minister of Labour on the 7th December, and by a deputa-tion from the Irish Textile Workers&apos; Federation received by Sir Montague Barlow on the6th.  The exact proposal,  however, of the committee of the London County Council isnotable among these for the way in which it is supported by detailed arguments and sug-suggestions, and for the fact  that it  shows some appreciation  of the technical difficulties involved.     Relief of Unemployment. The unemployment problem is increasing in severity.  the seizure of public buildings and empty houses by the unempbyed has continued in various parts of the country ;  notable recent cases are those of the occupation of the public baths  .at Acton,  and of four large private houses at Swansea.   No evictions have taken placeup to date.     Cotton Textile Industry:  Short Time. It is now reported that at a  meeting of theFederation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, held in Manchester on  the 7th Decem-ber, it was decided that short time in the Egyptian section of the trade should be continued for a third month.  This discussion was arrived at independently of the ballot which hasresulted in the adoption of short time in the American section.     Labour and Ireland. It will be remembered that a joint commission of inquiry into thesituation in Ireland was appointed by the Labour Party and should have proceeded toIreland on the 22nd November, but owing to the events in Dublin on the 21st Novemberthey did  not sail until the following  week.   The commission consisted of Mr. arthur henderson, M.P., chairman, Messrs. T. Lawson, M.P., and W. Lunn, M.P., representingthe Parliamentary  Labour  Party;  Messrs. A.  G.  Cameron and F.  J. Jowett, chairman and  vice-chairman  of  the  Executive Council of  the Labour Party;  Mr. J. Bromley,representing  the Executive Council of the Labour Party; and Mr. Arthur Greenwood,secretary.  Mr. Henderson and Mr. Adamson returned on the 6th December,  and hadan interview with the Prime Minister on the 7th December, when they reported to him the position in Ireland as they had found it during their visit.  The Labour Party haveissued  an official statement expressing satisfaction with  the report of Messrs. Adamsonand  Henderson on  the  work  of the  commission.  The  other  members,  after making further investigations, returned on the 16th.    With regard to  the situation on the Irish railways, a deputation representing the  wholeof the  Irish railwaymen came to England on the 9th December, and have been in con-sultation with the  Executive Committee of  the  National Union of railwaymen.  Theproceedings of this meeting were private, but Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., issued a statement to the effect that the Executive Committee have decided to convene an &quot; All  Ireland &quot;conference, to be held in Dublin on the 21st December.   At this conference, which is to  ibe representative of every branch in Ireland affected by the dispute, a final decision on thematter is to be taken.   Mr. Thomas also points out that&quot; it is only fair to say that this de-cision to refuse to handle munitions of war was decided  upon without the authority ofmy Executive, and whilst they to-day express their determination to carry on the fight,we feel that the consequences both to Ireland and this country are such  that the matter should be fairly and freely discussed by such a representative conference  as is being con-intervened.&quot;  This seems to indicate that the National  Executive are being forced to act,and to consider the  possibility of giving active support, instead of mere academic approval,.to the action of their Irish members.  It is understood that the lack of effective assistancehitherto  has  provoked considerable resentment in Ireland, and has provided capital for those who  desire  the separation of Irish and English trade unions, and  the building  upof an Irish labour movement entirely independent of English influences.    Engineering and Shipbuilding Industries: The k.W-hour Week. It was determined, inDecember, 1919, to appoint a joint committee of employers and employed in the engineering and  shipbuilding industries to investigate the  economic relation of production to hoursof work and the methods of manufacture in the two industries in this and other countries,and it was. agreed that, pending the completion of such inquiry,* the claim for a  reductionof hours from 47 to 44 per week should be adjourned.  It is now possible to give an accountof the progress of the inquiry up to the 15th November.   * An account of the progress of the inquiry up to the 4th June, and of the proceedings of the annual meetingof the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation with regard to the inquiry, was given in this ReportVol. II, No. 4, 24th July, p. 133.     (B 16753)                                                            4 E 2
      The first meeting of the joint committee was held on the 23rd March, 1920.  At this  and a subsequent meeting, the general plan of campaign for carrying out the investigation  was settled.   It was decided  that it was essential that representative shipbuilding and  engineering establishments should be visited.in all parts of the country, and that employers  should be asked to furnish statistical and other information in respect of the points in regard  to  which definite  information was required.  Four  ordinary meetings of the committee  had taken place by the 4th June, and, in the course of the first four months of the inquiry,  the committee held informal meetings in. London, Glasgow, Newcastle, Leeds, Birkenhead,  and Barrow, at the conclusion of visits to various works in those districts.   In all, some  23  works and shipyards had been visited.  A questionnaire was compiled, and  replies  received from  113 engineering and shipbuilding firms.  The process of abstracting the  detailed information contained in the replies has now been completed ; and reports based  on  the replies to each question are being drafted for  consideration by  the committee.      The work of the committee was suspended during August and September owing to  illness among prominent members, but early in October, activity was resumed and arrange-  ments were made for visiting the United States.  The coal strike, however, and the extensive  negotiations as to working conditions proceeding between the National and the Engineering  Employers&apos; Federations and the unions concerned, have made it impossible for the members  of either side of the committee to be absent from this country until the end of December.  Some further delay, therefore, in completing the work of the committee is inevitable.  Control of Industry.      Railways. The attitude of the railway companies towards the proposals of the Ministry  of Transport, as set forth in Command Paper No. 787, as to the re-organisation of transport  undertakings in Great Britain and their relation to the State, has been formulated in a letter  to  the Minister of  Transport from Lord Churchill, chairman of the Railway Companies&apos;  Association.   In this letter it is stated that the Association agree with the Minister of  Transport that grouping  on the basis of co-operation is right in principle, and consider that  it accords with the past practice of railway  companies in this  country.   But they have&apos;  submitted an alternative grouping scheme, on the ground that this will secure financial  equilibrium in each group.      With regard to the management proposals contained in the official scheme, the letter  declares that the Association are &quot; unable to acquiesce in, and will strenuously oppose, any  suggestion that&apos; workers elected by workers &apos; shall be appointed to the boards of manage-  ment.&quot;  Such  a proposal  is condemned as  quite unjustifiable and wrong in principle,  while it is contended that, from the point of view of discipline alone, the position created by  such appointments would become intolerable.  &quot; In the opinion of the Association no servant  in a subordinate position should in any circumstances be placed at any time in authority  over his official chief in the conduct of the business of the undertaking.&quot;      The Association recognise, however, the possibility  of advantage resulting from the  co-operation of workers and the companies in the matter of certain operating problems, and  suggest that  this might be effected by the appointment of committees composed of officers  nominated by the Board of Management, workers elected by  and from among the workers,  and a secretary appointed by the  Board, under the chairmanship of a director.   The estab-  Hshment of Central and  National Wages Boards is objected to as tending to standardise,  wages and conditions in varying districts ; and a return to the Conciliation Board system is  proposed.      The letter also deals with the proposals of the Ministry for a &quot; Finance Development  Fund &quot; and  &quot; Rate-Fixing Machinery &quot; ; and recommends that owing to the difficulties  attendant on the introduction of a new grouping scheme, the proposed system shall not  come into operation before the 1st January, 1924, the existing agreement and the Govern-  ment guarantee to be continued until that date.      The letter was submitted to  a meeting of the Association, and all the proposals con-  tained in it were unanimously approved, with the exception of the &quot; alternative scheme of  grouping &quot; which was dissented from by the North Eastern, the Hull and Barnsley, and the  Barry Railway Companies.      A joint  conference  of the East Midlands Divisional Council of  the Railway  Clerks  Association and of  District Councils of the National Union of Railwaymen and the associated -  ated Society  of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen was  held on the  .11th December at  Derby, and a resolution adopted demanding representation of the workers upon the boards  of management of the railways.   Local co-operative societies, other trade unions and the  local branch of  the National Alliance of Employers and Employed were represented  at the  conference in addition to  the three organisations of railway workers.
 Industrial and Other Organisations.     Scottish Trades Union Congress. At the Dunfermline meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress  last April, the Parliamentary Committee of  the Trades Union Congress were asked to consider the existing form of trade union organisation with a view to recom- mending improvements.  The Committee have now prepared a memorandum, which  is to be considered at a special meeting of the Congress in Glasgow next month. The memoran- dum points out  that the most obvious  defect in  the present  system is the multiplicity of unions.  The Scottish organisation is recommended to adopt proposals analogous to those for a General Council which the  British Trades Union Congress have adopted, modifying or developing the scheme to suit Scottish conditions.  The memorandum proceeds  to give a summary of the constitution and functions of the Council as they have been evolved by the Trade  Union Co-ordination  Committee.   It  finally  refers to the acute difference of opinion on the  question of &quot; craft &quot; versus &quot; industrial &quot; unionism, and states  that the principle of union according to industry is the correct road of advance.     Carpenters  and Woodcutting Machinists. A dispute which, raises  some interesting questions is in progress between the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet  Makers and Joiners and the Amalgamated  Society of Woodcutting Machinists.  The carpenters and joiners, together with two other unions, decided at a national conference held on the 28th February, 1919, that labour should be withdrawn from any shop where a system other than plain time-work was in operation.   Almost immediately a dispute arose at the works of Messrs. Boulton &amp;  Paul, Ltd., at Norwich,  who refused to recognise the  union&apos;s prin- ciple,  and retained a  piece-work system.  The members of the carpenters&apos; and joiners&apos; society were accordingly withdrawn from the firm in January, 1920, after negotiations had failed.   A few men refused to obey the executive^ order,  and remained with the firm. This involved their expulsion from the  union, and woodwork subsequently manufactured by the firm was  therefore made  by non-union  labour under conditions not recognised by the carpenters and joiners, who decided that, wherever such work was sent, their members should refuse to  fix or handle it.  Trouble then arose between the joiners and the Amal- gamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists, as  the latter union did not withdraw their labour  from the  firm.   The joiners contend  that, if their &quot; legitimate &quot; action had been supported at the time  by the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives,  to which both unions are affiliated, and all the federated unions thus brought into line, the dispute would have been speedily settled. The  woodcutting machinists in the preliminary agita- tion at Norwich had voted 60 to 3 against the piece-work system, but this decision has since been altered, and they are now working on the system with the sanction of their executive committee,  and are also supplying the material they turn out to the ex-members of the joiners&apos; society who complete it. The carpenters and joiners have been in negotiation with the woodcutting machinists since February last, to induce their members to co-operate with them.  Having failed  to effect this, they got into  touch with the Federation, and demanded that the secretary should instruct all local branches to watch material coming into their district, with the object of  refusing to handle any sent from the firm, and should urge the woodcutting machinists, in  particular, to stand by the joiners at Norwich.  The Federation suggested a conference between the  two unions,  and a meeting  took place on the 25th September, attended also by representatives of the Emergency Committee of the Federation.   The  representative of the woodcutting  machinists, however, refused to agree to the proposal of the joiners that two members from each society should proceed to Norwich to  instruct the members there to cease supplying labour to non-union joiners, on the  ground that  their full executive were  not present.   The  carpenters and  joiners continued to press the Federation to act, and finally, at the Federation^ quarterly meeting on the 19th November, a resolution  was passed instructing the woodcutting   machinists to comply with a decision of the Emergency Committee that they should withdraw their members from Messrs. Boulton &amp; Paul on the ground that they were working with &quot; black- legs.&quot;   The woodcutting machinists&apos; position is that they have fulfilled the whole of their oblgations towards the joiners in this particular dispute, and they demand to know whether the Federation claim  the right  to control affiliated trades engaged in  the engineering industry,  although at the joint meeting in September the plea that Messrs. Boulton &amp; Paul were mainly an engineering firm was denied by the joiners.  The machinists also state thatthe carpenters and joiners have formally instructed their members to continue at work incases where the machinists were on strike, and suggest that the whole object of the presentagitation is to crush their organisation.   They have refused, therefore, to obey the instruc-tion  of the Federation until they receive a satisfactory answer to their questions.
Trade Union Topics.    Union  of Post Office Workers. At the annual conference of the union held last Mayit was decided that a strike policy should be incorporated in the union&apos;s programme, butin order to ratify this decision it was necessary to take a ballot vote of members on thesubject.  The ballot has resulted in a  majority of over 12,000 on a vote of 83,000, in favourof the adoption of a strike policy and the accumulation of a strike fund.    The executive committee of the union, at a meeting on the 8th December, decided toaccept the  result of the ballot,  and to collect weekly contributions to the strike fund asfrom the 1st  January, .1921.   No strike may  be  called until a  ballot of members hasrecorded a vote in favour of such action.  The executive committee  are now considering theprovision, of strike machinery, and will submit a report to  the annual  conference,  to  beheld in Edinburgh in May, 1921.    Dock,  Wharf, Riverside  and General Workers&apos;  Union. Among the many activitiesundertaken by this union is the  organisation of flour-mill workers.   The  flour-mill workers of Bristol and South Wales have already been organised in a special section of the union,and it is now announced that the members of the National Union of Millers have decided,by an overwhelming majority, to transfer to what will in future be known as the NationalAmalgamated Milling Section of this union,  which  will include about 75 per cent, of thepersons employed in the milling trade.    A &quot; national provisional committee &quot; to work in connection with the union has been  setup, and it  has been arranged that this committee  shall frame  a wages  programme policyand develop organisation.  It is also  stated that one of the first problems to be consideredwill be the best method of  dealing with those firms who threaten to withdraw from theNational Joint Industrial Council for the Flour Milling Industry.    Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association. With reference to the  criticisms on the coal settle-ment, and the resentment aroused among certain sections of the Welsh and Scottish miners,it is interesting to note that, at a delegate meeting of the council of the  Yorkshire Miners&apos;Association, at Barnsley, on the 7th December, a resolution demanding the resignation of Messrs. Smith, Potts and Roebuck, members of the executive of the Miners&apos; Federationof Great Britain, was heavily defeated, 46 votes being  cast in favour  of  the resolution,and 2,667 against.  Each vote represented 50 members.Ex-Service Men.    Amalgamation of Organisations. Representatives of the National Federation of Dis-charged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, the Comrades of the Great War, the national association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers,  and the Officers&apos; Association were present at a conference held in London on the 11th December, to consider the question  of amal-gamation.  It was decided to appoint a provisional unity committee of  six representatives from each of  the four bodies to supervise and complete the arrangements for amalgamationand, if thought advisable, to co-opt representatives of other ex-Service men&apos;s organisations.The committee were also instructed  to call an &quot; Unity Delegate Conference &quot; as early aspossible in the New Year.International  Relations of  Labour.    International Labour Office. The first session of the Joint Maritime Commission  setup by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, held  at  Genoain July last,  met, under the chairmanship of M. Arthur Fontaine, at Geneva  on the  8thNovember, and  continued their sittings on the 9th and 10th.  The  matters  discussedincluded the constitution of the Commission, Standing Orders, the report  of the Directorof the International Labour Office, unemployment insurance for seamen, protection of  the health of seamen, technical education and regulation of the hours of work on board ship.In opening the session, the chairman explained that the Commission was, in some respects,a consultative committee, to which  the  International  Labour Office would appeal when considering technical maritime  questions.SfTtf. The report of. the Director dealt,  inter alia, with the ratification of the Draft conventions and Recommendations of the Genoa Conference, and the work already  undertaken  with aview to the establishment of an International Seamen&apos;s Code.   The importance  of giving effect  to Recommendations was emphasised;   and the  Commission instructed the Inter-national Labour Office to inquire as to how the Recommendation regarding  the limitationof the hours of work in the fishing industry could be applied.   The Commission also  ap-proved the general method of  procedure proposed by the Director for the elaboration of
NEGOTIATIONS  AND  DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations    Building Trades Operatives (Various Areas). It is reported that the unions affiliatedto the Midland Area Joint Council for the Building Trades have given notice for a revisionof wages as follows:           (1) Wages in &quot; A &quot; towns to be increased to 2s. 8d. for craftsmen and 2s. Qd. for labourers, with       a guaranteed week of 44 hours all the year round.          (2) Other grades to be increased in proportion and each town below &quot; A &quot; to be promoted one       grade.    It is stated that, in reply to this claim, the Midland Federation of Building TradesEmployers have decided to give notice of a  counter-claim containing  the following proposals:           (1) Reduction of id. an hour to craftsmen and of Id. an hour to labourers.          (2) Increase in the working hours in summer from 44 to 49f per week.          (3) All towns in the Midland Area, except Birmingham, to be reduced one grade.                    * See this Report, Vol.  II, No. 22, 27th November, p. 606. an International Seamen&apos;s Code ;   requested the International Labour Office to ascertain from the Governments thejmeasures taken,  or contemplated, for the  establishment of national codes ;  instructed the Office to send to the Governments, and also to the national owners&apos; and seamen&apos;s organisations, for their observations, a memorandum on the methods adopted for the  construction of an International Code;  [and proposed  as a preliminary measure that the drafting of an International Code of searnen&apos;s articles of agreement should be taken in hand.     With regard^to*unemployment insurancerfor seamen,rthe Commissionlelt that before considering the problem from an international standpoint they should be acquainted with the results of the scheme recently introduced in Great Britain.&apos;1 They decided  that con- sideration should be postponed until the next session, when a report should be submitted on the operation of the scheme in Great Britain, and on  similar measures^ taken in other countries.  The Commission were  unanimously agreed as  to the urgent need for action in the matter of the  protection of the  health of  seamen, particularly  as  regards venereal disease ; and the Office was instructed to institute forthwith an inquiry amongst doctors, or associations of doctors, who had specialised in such questions, and  to approach the Governments and shipowners with  a view to securing the introduction of effective measures, as well as the establishment of institutions  to provide seamen with healthy recreation in ports, and also to start a campaign of propaganda among the seamen&apos;s organisations.  It was  also felt that  an inquiry should be made into the  question of seamen&apos;s  technical education, and that this question  could not be treated separately from that  of  seamen&apos;s recreation.   The  Office was instructed to proceed accordingly.    The proposed conference of representatives of the shipowners and of the seamen to consider further the question of hours of  labour on board ship and the possibility of arriving at an agreement thereon* was also discussed and agreed to in principle.   The Commission unanimously decided to invite the Director to preside at the conference.  It was also decided that the International Shipping Federation, which includes the shipowners of six important maritime countries, should endeavour  to secure the participation in the conference of shipowners of other countries.  The conference will meet at  Brussels on the 23rd January next.    Inter-Allied Federation of Ex-Service Men. A conference was recently held in Paris for the purpose of  forming  this  organisation,  which will  be known as the Federation Interalliee  des  Anciens  Combattants.   Ex-Service  men  of  Great Britain, France, America, Czechoslovakia, Jugo-Slavia, Eumania  and Belgium, were represented.  Captain Towse and Colonel  Crossneld, of  the  Comrades of the Great War, were the British delegates.   M. Charles Bertrand  (France)  was elected president of the  Federation, andMr.  Cabot-Ward  (America)  and   Colonel  Crossfield  (Great Britain)  vice-presidents. Various schemes were outlined for  the preservation of goodwill jamong allied ex-Servicemen, and it was unanimously agreed that the organisation  should be entirely non-political.
Negotiations and  Disputes-continued.    The Manchester district of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives havegiven 0 months&apos; notice for an all-round increase of Sd. an hour as from, the 1st May, 1921.The Manchester, Salford and District Building Trades Employers&apos; Association, who are strongly supported by the North Western Building Trades Employers&apos; Federation, have sent a counter-notice of their intention to reduce craftsmen&apos;s rates by 2d. an hour and labourers&apos;rates hjAd. an hour as from the same date.    Engineers (National). The joint conference of  representatives of the amalgamated engineering Union and the Engineering and the National  Employers&apos; Federations was resumed  at  York on the 8th December.   A deadlock was reached on the wages question,consequent upon the request of the representatives of the Federations  that consideration should be adjourned for six months.   -The union are now considering  what further action they should take.    Women  in the Engineering Trades (National). Representatives  of the  engineering and the National-Employers&apos; Federations met  those of the National Federation of general works, the Workers&apos;  Union,  the National Amalgamated  Union  of Labour,  and theAmalgamated Society of Gas, Municipal and General Workers at York on the 10th Decemberwith reference to the question of an advance of wages for women employed in the engineer-ing and allied trades.   The claim is for an increase  of 30s. a week on  present rates.   no decision was arrived at.    Electricians  (National). Representatives  of the  Electrical  Trades Union  met theEngineering and the  National Employers&apos;  Federations  at York on the 10th Decemberin respect of their application that electrical contractors&apos;  rates should be paid  to  men employed  on maintenance and installation work in engineering shops.  The employersintimated that they could not admit the principle that any section of  men in their shopsshould be paid rates fixed between the  Electrical Trades Union and  any other body ofemployers.   No agreement was  therefore arrived at.    Tramwaymen  (National). In  connection with  the meeting  of the National joint industrial Council for  the Tramway Industry on the  15th December, to discuss the dead-lock arising out of  the national claim, previously referred to  in this Report, the followingitems  may be of interest as indicative of the attitude of the men in the localities.  A massmeeting of  London  tramway  workers on the 12th December passed  the followingresolution:           &quot; That this meeting, representing 17,000 workers,  protests against the attitude of the employers      in refusing to consider the justice and merit of our claim, and to have the claim adjudicated upon      by a third party. We express confidence in the National Negotiating Committee, and pledge our-      sel^es to support  unitedly any action the committee may deem necessary to enforce the settlement      of the claim.&quot;    Similar resolutions have been passed at Wakefield, Leeds  and Sheffield.   At Dewsburythe men have requested the executive of the United Vehicle Workers to take a  strike ballot.Throughout Lancashire  and Cheshire week-end meetings of  the  tramwaymen demandedthat the executive  should  withdraw all labour.  A mass meeting of the Birmingham men have called upon the executive to tender strike notices, failing a settlement at the meetingof the Joint Industrial Council  on the 15th December.  The attitude of the Manchestertramway workers has already been referred to in this Report.  A mass meeting of thesemen, on the 5th December, appointed a deputation to wait on the executive of the UnitedVehicle Workers, with the object of obtaining permission to take local action to  enforcetheir demand for an increase of  1 a week.   A mass  meeting of Bristol  men decided to askpermission to strike locally on the 20th December,  if no settlement was reached on thenational claim. .    Shop Assistants [London). With reference to the application on behalf of the shop assistants engaged  in  London West End stores, previously noted in this Report, no replyhas been received by the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemenand Clerks from the Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors  on the question of acceptance of the Army and Navy Stores Award, when made.  Accordingly ballot paperswere issued  on the 8th  December.  The result &quot;of the ballot was announced on the 11thDecember,  as follows: For awaiting the  Army and Navy Stores  Award, 3,709; forimmediate  stoppage,  3,245.  The Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors haveissued a circular, stating that there is no change of policy on their part, and that the thirteenstores concerned in the dispute, other than the Army  and Navy Stores, are agreed that theycannot decide in advance to  accept any award which they  have not  seen,  and to whichthey are not parties.
 Negotiations and Disputes-continued. Strikes and Lock-Outs.     Railway Shopmen (Doncaster).-T)ie litters who are members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and are employed by the Great Northern railway Company at Don- caster, and various  other repair centres, recently handed in notices in support of their demand that their wages should be brought up to the level of the district rate in engineering shops, with the addition of 10s. weekly for day workers.  Consequent upon an interview with the company&apos;s officials, it was decided at a  mass meeting on the  1st December to suspend the notices pending negotiations.  On the 13th  December, however, over  700 fitters and running shed men at Doncaster ceased work.   A number of men are also reported out at London, Peterborough, Grantham, Nottingham, York, Ardsley, Leeds and Bradford.    Shipyard Joiners (National). There are no developments of importance in the strike, of shipyard joiners.   Three separate items  of  interest  may  be mentioned.  Firstly,  the two chief unions concerned, the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners  and the Amalgamated Society  of Carpenters, Cabinet  Makers  and Joiners,  have imposed an embargo on overtime.  This came  into  operation on the  9th November, and covers all kinds of work save that of housing and operations of urgency in the interests of human safety.  Secondly, the joiners who  are unaffected by the strike are holding a  ballot on a proposed levy in support of the strikers, the levy to vary from 2s. to 4s. a week in accordance with the operatives&apos; hourly rate.  Thirdly, the executive of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet  Makers and Joiners have requested their branches in Canada,  the United States and South Africa,  to refrain from the execution of repair work on British ships.  A similar request was made to the Bureau of the Woodworkers&apos; International at Amsterdam; and  a  reply has been received to the effect that all woodworking unions on the Continent have been warned against working on British  ships.    Hosiery Operatives (Scotland). A complete stoppage of work in the hosiery factories in Dumfries and in other centres of  the industry in surrounding districts took place on the11th December.  This arises out  of the  proposals for the non-payment of Award No.  422 of the Industrial Court referred to last week.Settlements and Agreements.    Engineers (National). Members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union have ballotedon the proposed agreement regarding overtime  and  night-shift work.   The result of  the ballot is :   for  the  agreement, 62,668 ; against, 19,517.   The  effect of the new agreement will be to substitute for the varying local practices a single national arrangement, applicableto all areas equally.   For overtime, a minimum rate of  time-and-a-half  has been secured. The night-shift working week is to  consist of 5 nights, totalling 47 hours, with breaks for meals to be arranged mutually.   The ordinary rate for night-shift work is to be time-and-a- third.*    A joint recommendation was  arrived at  on the  9th December by the  conference of representatives  of the Engineering and the  National Employers&apos;  Federations and  theAmalgamated  Engineering Union,  at York,  on the question of the three-shift system. The provisions are recommended for acceptance in the hope that they may have someeffect on unemployment.   They  are applicable nationally, subject to consultation with the trade union works committee in each case.  Of the three shifts to be worked,  two will be of the weekly length of 37-i hours, and one of the length of 43 hours.  For each ofthe day-shifts payment will be made for 47 hours ; for the night-shift of 37j hours, payment will be as for 50 hours.  This does not mean necessarily the general adoption of the three- shift system throughout the engineering industry,  but  only that any particular firm who desire  to adopt it may do so  after consultation with  their works committee, provided they accept the conditions  laid  down in  the draft national agreement.           The following division of the day is recommended,  subject to any modification necessitated       by local conditions :               Monday to Friday :  1st  shift, 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.;  2nd shift, 2 p.m. to 10 p.m.;  3rd shift,           10 p.m. to 6 a.m.;  Saturday, 6 a.m. to noon.           Each shift is to have a half-hour break for a meal.   The provisions are to apply to workmen       employed on engineering work in engineering,  boilermaking and foundry departments.  Further       consideration is to be given to the  case of maintenance work, other than in these departments.                     * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 15, 9th October, p. 437.

\Negotiations and Disputes-continued.    Operatives in Pig Iron Trade (Scotland). The Scottish Iron Masters&apos; Association, andthe Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, on the 2nd December, considered the question ofthe revision of the sliding scale for the pig iron trade in Scotland.   Agreement was reached on several of the points in dispute,  but other points were referred to a committee of two representatives from each side.  In the event of the parties failing to agree on all outstand-ing points, it was resolved to refer any such points to Sir Thomas Munro, with two assessorsfrom each side.    Dockers (National). It will be remembered that the report  of the  Court  of inquiry into the conditions of employment of dock and waterside labour, issued on the 31st March,recommended, inter alia, the immediate formation of a National Joint Standing IndustrialCouncil for  the industry, together with district councils  and works committees.   It also suggested that this Council would be the proper body, failing private agreement between theparties, for reaching a decision upon other matters connected with the conditions of employ-ment of dock labourers, which were originally referred to the Court.    These recommendations of the Report  have now been adopted.   A conference washeld between the negotiating committees of  the  employers and the National TransportWorkers&apos; Federation on the 8th December at which it was decided to establish the national joint Council.   Lord Devonport and Mr. Ernest  Bevin were elected chairmen of  theemployers&apos; and employees&apos; sides respectively, and Mr. G. Grinling Harris, 22,  Billiter Street,E.C., was appointed secretary.  It was agreed that discussion of the other matters left over from the report of Lord  Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry, namely, registration, maintenance duringunemployment and  under-employment, weekly payment of wages, and working of shifts,should be taken up by the Joint Council.  The question of maintenance was referred to asub-committee to consider and report.  The sub-committee are meeting on the 20thDecember.     Seamen (Bristol). On the 10th December, the seamen at Bristol, whose refusal to signdeep-sea articles was noted last week, decided to resume  duty, on the understanding that immediate steps were to be taken to secure a revision of the agreement of the 1st August,1919, with the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and  General Workers&apos; Union as to the manning ofships transferring from Bristol to other British  ports.   The strike  committee  was re-appointed as a distress committee.  It was also empowered to conduct negotiations on the seamen&apos;s behalf with regard to the drafting of the new agreement.     [Other disputes, negotiations and  settlements are referred to in the Industrial RelationsDepartment section of the Report, pages 685 to 689.]
PART   IL-THE   WORK   OF   THE  MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL  RELATIONS  DEPARTMENT.              ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND  ALLIED TRADES.    Roll Turners (fireat Britain). The British Roll Turners&apos; Trade Society made a claim for a universal flat rate of 2s. Qd. per hour, in reply to which the employers&apos; associationsoffered a tonnage bonus scheme.  The Industrial Court decided that the claim had notbeen established,  and expressed the opinion that acceptance of the tonnage bonus scheme,for an experimental period if so desired, should be given favourable consideration.  (AwardNo. 549.)                  BUILDING  AND WORKS  OF CONSTRUCTION.    Demarcation  Dispute:  Plumbers and  Heating Engineers. In accordance with theproposals made by the department a conference of the executives of the plumbers&apos; andthe heating engineers&apos; unions took place at York on the 1st December, under the chairman-ship of an officer  of the department.  It was found impossible to arrive at any settlementof the dispute in connection with the Manchester housing schemes.  On the general question,the heating  engineers expressed themselves as unable to entertain  the proposal of an amalgamation of  the two unions, and the plumbers were unable to agree to the establish-ment of any  machinery for settling demarcation questions as they arise.  The departmenthave reported the dispute to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress,with a request that the committee take any action open to them to obtain a settlement.                           MINING AND QUARRYING.    Quarrying. The inaugural meeting of the Freestone Section of the Joint IndustrialCouncil was held on the 9th December, when a representative of the Chief ConciliationOfficer, Manchester, attended.  Owing to inadequate representation of  the employees&apos;side it was impossible to transact any business, and the meeting was adjourned until such time as the employees&apos; side had  appointed accredited representatives from each DistrictCouncil.  It appears that the meeting was called at the instigation of the Workers&apos; Union,who are pressing for the consideration of the Yorkshire quarrymen&apos;s demand for an increaseof rates from 2s. Wd. an hour to 2s. Sd. an hour.  The Yorkshire employers have put in a counter-demand for a reduction of rates by 4c?. an hour, and the Yorkshire District council have not been able to reach a settlement of the matter.    Clay. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met on the 10th December,to consider an application that the overtime agreement of the 15th Septemberf should beextended to kilnmen, firemen and shift-workers.  No agreement had been reached by the negotiating Committee at Leeds on the 18th November.  The principal claim was that these workers should receive overtime rates, reduced, however, to time-and-a-quarter, for week-end work.  The discussion disclosed a great diversity in the number of hours worked, andin the payment received per week, throughout  the country.  A proposal that a uniformseven-shift week of  56 hours at Is. 9d. per hour should be established was rejected by theemployers as impracticable, though they thought it possible that a ratio between the shift-workers&apos; rate and the labourers&apos; rate might be fixed.  After a separate meeting, they alsorefused to concede the principle at issue, that overtime should be paid to shift-workers forweek-end work.  They  contended  that shift-workers already  received special rates inconsideration of the inconveniences entailed.  They offered, however, to  recommend totheir associations that the principle of 8-hour shifts be conceded, and that seven-shiftworkers should receive war advances of 49s. plus one-sixth per week ; and, further, that men working shifts of more than eight hours should receive overtime rates for the hours worked in  excess of eight. -(B 16753)* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 23, 4th December, p. 636.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 13, 25th September, p. 400.4S2
     The workers&apos; side could not accept these recommendations as an answer to their claim ; and it was agreed that the questions be referred back to the Negotiating Committee, who will meet again on the 12th January and report to the full Committee on the 13th.                                FOOD AND DRINK.     Baking (Scotland).-&apos;\&quot;he Scottish Bakers&apos; Industrial Council met on the 7th December. The master bakers had tabled a resolution that the question of the employment of women should be referred to arbitration, failing which they would retire from the Council.  The operatives stated that their executive had not yet had time to consider the resolution, and that no reply could be given before January at the earliest.   It was agreed to let the matter stand over.     A demand for an increase of 10s. per week in wages was put forward, with the threat of a strike on the 18th December, failing a settlement.   After some discussion the operatives reduced their demand to 7s. Qd.   The meeting was adjourned until the 16th December, to give the employers time  to consult their association.                                   TRANSPORT.     Motor Drivers (London). Twenty members of the United Vehicle Workers employed by the Despatch Motor  Co., Southwark  Bridge Road, struck on the 7th December, in opposition to what they termed an &quot; internal trade union &quot; being formed by the firm, and were all replaced by  ex-Service men on the following day.   The union requested the assis- tance of the department, but the firm state that they have engaged these ex-Service men on a permanent basis, and that they do not consider there is any need to discuss the matter with the union.                                    POTTERY.     Pottery Workers. The National Federation of Building Trades  Operatives demanded building trade rates and conditions for three  plasterers engaged by Messrs. Doulton  &amp; Co., Ltd., on model making for terra-cotta work used upon building, and, failing agreement, threatened to bring out all their members employed by the firm.  A settlement was arrived at at a conference convened by the Chief Conciliation Officer, London,  by the firm offering to pay 2s.  d. per hour without, however, recognising the men as in any way coming under building trade rates.                                    ASBESTOS.     Asbestos. The Joint Industrial Council met on the 8th December.  The  quarterly adjustment of wages in accordance with the sliding scale agreement of May last was made. The employers asked that in future the adjustment should be made monthly.  The trade union representatives resisted this, claiming that they had lost by the quarterly adjustment on the rising market, and it was only fair that the same method should be adhered to now that there was a prospect that prices were about to fall.  The employers replied by emphasised- sising the gravity of the trade depression, and hinted broadly that wages would have to be reduced in the near future.     A long discussion took place on a resolution moved by a trade union representative asking  the employers to assist the unions  in  preventing the employment of non-union labour.  Despite a clause  in the constitution binding  the Council to encourage organisa- tion on both sides, the employers resisted this resolution and abstained from voting.                                     GLASS.     Glass. The Sectional Council for the Domestic,  Fancy Ware and Illuminating Section/met on the 16th December.   Officers for the ensuing year were elected, and provision was made for the expenses of the Council.  It was decided that in the coming year the Council should meet quarterly in Birmingham.   With regard to a claim by  the National Union of General Workers for a 10s. advance to all semi-skilled and unskilled workers employed by Messrs. Molyneaux &amp; Webb, it was ascertained that the firm are members of the British Flint Glass Manufacturers&apos; Association, who had decided that no action should be taken. The matter was not brought directly before the Council, as the union  are not represented. It is probable that they will consequently seek representation.  A year ago they had not sufficient members in this section of the industry to justify representation.  Inquiries are being conducted in order to find out whether the position has changed.
                                     TEXTILES.     Scottish Hosiery. Notices as to the termination of contracts of service and the re- engagement of workers at reduced rates, in accordance with the West of Scotland Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Association^ resolution of the 24th November,* have been issued by several firms, to take effect as from the 11th December.   The unions strongly resent the manner in which the employers have acted, and a stoppage involving about 3,000 workers appears very probable.  A special meeting of the Joint Industrial Council, at which members of the association will probably be present,  has been convened for the 14th December ; and, in view of this meeting, efforts have been made to induce the employers to suspend the opera- tion of the notices.  The success of these efforts appears doubtful.  The unions regard the employers&apos; action as an  attempt to circumvent the provisions of Industrial Court Awards Nos.  422  and  528.     Carpets. Members of the Joint Industrial Council, at an interview on the 8th December, stated that the Scottish employers who recently seceded from the Council had been invited to attend the next meeting on the 16th December, when the question of setting up District Councils with autonomous powers in wages questions would be considered.   The Scottish employers and operatives have jointly submitted a draft  constitution for a District Council for Scotland.              PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.     Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales).  The first meeting of the  Provincial Council for South Wales and Monmouthshire was held on the 8th December.  The constitution was adopted and officers were elected.  A resolu- tion was proposed by the staff side to the effect that local  authorities in the area who had not granted increases in salary equivalent to the war bonus of the Civil Service scale be recommended to grant the Civil. Service scale.  The  employers  agreed, as a temporary measure pending the establishment of salary scales  for the area,  that  local authorities who had not granted such advances, calculated upon the salary  in August, 1914, plus automatic  increments, should be recommended to do so.     The adjourned meeting of the conference of representatives of the local authorities in the West Midlands Area, covering  Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcester- shire and  Herefordshire, and of  the staff associations concerned,  called to consider the establishment of a Provincial Council, was held on the 8th December.   The constitution for the Provincial Council was adopted, and the allocation of representation decided.    Electricity Supply.- -The South Wales District Joint Industrial Council,  on the  30th November, agreed to refer to the National Council a claim for an advance of 3^d. per hour, but the  stokers and labourers employed  by the South Wales Power Distribution Co., Treforest, refused to await the decision of the National Council and handed in notices to cease work on the 2nd December, unless the full amount was granted as from the 1st July. In spite  of the warning of  the local organiser of the National Union of General Workers that the  strike would not be recognised, and notwithstanding an offer  by the management of 3d. per hour increase as from the 3rd December, the men ceased work on the 2nd Decem- ber.   Many collieries are  dependent on the company for their supplies, and, within an hour of the strike, stokers lent by the collieries arrived, and the electricians were instructed to remain at work.  This had  a chastening effect, and a settlement was arrived at.  The men will receive an increase of 3d. per hour, the increase to be  dependent  on the ruling of the National Joint Industrial Council.  Work was resumed on the 3rd December.    The  District Council for the No.  2 (Yorkshire) Area met on the 8th December.  A number of  questions arising out of the putting into operation of the  schedule of basic rates and conditions of labour were determined.    Local Authorities&apos;&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual  Workers (England and Wales).  The District Council for the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire met on the 9th December.Matters relating to the grading scheme previously adopted by the Council were considered. The District Council for Northumberland and Durham met on the  10th December.   Themeeting was mainly concerned with  consideration of  several threatened local disputeswithin the area.    Tramway. The  representatives of the municipal undertakings and  the  trade union side of the Council met  on the  7th December.   It was reported  that 39 undertakingshad voted in favour of referring the application of the trade union side for an. increase of           * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 24,11th December, p. 658, and also p. 683 above.
wages  to arbitration, and that 45 undertakings had voted against arbitration.  Thedepartment have invited the Council to meet again under the chairmanship of an officerof the department on the 15th December.    Electricity Supply Industry. The  National Joint  Board of  Employers and  StaffMembers met on the 11th  December, to consider further the situation arising out of the threatened withdrawal of  the members of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association.It was reported  that 162 undertakings  have accepted in their entirety the schedules andconditions of service recommended by the Board, and that these undertakings accounted for about 90 per cent,  of the total output of the country.  On the 13th December, repre-sentatives of the Board intimated to the  department that the Board had resolved that,having done all that was possible to secure the acceptance of the schedules, they should ask the department to enter into negotiations with respect to the  undertakings who hadnot accepted the schedules.  Representatives  of the department  subsequently met theexecutive of the Electrical Power  Engineers&apos;  Association.  It was agreed that,  as thedepartment were about to  enter into negotiations with the outstanding undertakings, theassociation should suspend the notices  against those undertakings, pending the negotia-tions.  As  regards the undertakings who have already accepted the schedules in their entirety, and any  undertakings  who,  as a result  of  the  negotiations, also accept theschedule, it was agreed that the department might intimate that the notices against  suchundertakings were withdrawn.                          GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.    War Office. The Industrial Council met on the 9th December.  The principal business was the consideration of the report of the Executive Committee on the setting up of workscommittees.  The official side undertook to consider a proposal from the trade union sidethat employees  on  War Department  vessels  should  be established;  the proposal isbased on a recent decision as to  the establishment of  men in the  Yard Craft Service ofthe Admiralty.                            MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.    Lock, Latch and Key. The Joint Industrial Council recently set up for this industryheld their  first  meeting at Willenhall on the 8th  December, and  adopted the draft constitution.    Match Manufacturing.-^]^ Joint Industrial Council met on the  9th December.  Areport was given of the meeting, addressed by the Minister and Mr. Whitley, to discuss theformation of an  Association of Joint Industrial Councils.  It was decided to request theMinistry to bring pressure  to bear on the Paper Box Trade Board to give  considerationto the  Council&apos;s  proposal,  referred to  them by the department, that the match manu-facturing industry should be excluded from the scope of the Board.    Warehousemen (Liverpool). The Chief Conciliation Officer has reported a settlement on the claim* made by the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union on behalfof their members employed in the warehouses of Messrs. Ridgways, Ltd.  The claim madeby the  union last July was that the workers should receive the rates fixed by the dockers&apos;agreement.  The firm were willing  that the claim should go to the Industrial Court for arbitration, but the union wished the matter to be referred to the Negotiating committee set up under Lord Shaw&apos;s  Report.   The latter body, however, decided that they had nojurisdiction in the matter and negotiations between the firm and the union then took place.The agreement provides for 11s. per week increase to all adult male labour receiving the firm&apos;s minimum of  3 per week, 10s. per week increase to men receiving above the minimum rate, and 5s. to  certain subnormal employees.  A scale for male juveniles  ranging from18s. per week at  14 years, to 52s. per week at 20 years, is introduced, and weekly rates forfemale  juveniles, varying from  17s. at 14  years to 44s. at 20 years. These  increases areto take effect from the 25th August, 1920.                                 PROFESSIONAL.    Insurance Workers.-The strike of  insurance officials continues.   In reply to a sug-gestion from the  department to the General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporationthat representatives of the directors should  meet representatives  of the department todiscuss the position, the chairman has replied that the subject is under consideration,                    * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 18, 30th October, p. 512.
     Clerks (Port Sunlight).-The National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union, who had asked Messrs. Lever Bros, to refer the question of clerks&apos; salaries to arbitration, have now asked for the application to be held over, pending the outcome of a claim in respect of the manual workers,  which has been referred to arbitration by the Soap and  Candle Joint Industrial Council.  It is understood that the firm are prepared to  concede to  the clerks any advance that may be given to the manual workers ; the union would probably be prepared to accept such an advance, provided that the basic rates for clerks were first of all satisfactorily settled, but they will probably press for a separate arbitration to fix basic rates.     Clerics (Scunlhorpe). It appears that there has been considerable unrest in the North- Eastern Area as a result of the delay in reaching an agreement with the employers in the iron and steel trade on the question of whether chief wages clerks and confidential clerks should be members of the union, and resolutions have been passed by various branches of the National Union of Clerks threatening a stoppage.  The executive of the union, however, instructed the branches to remain at work.  On the 26th November, the Frodingham Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd., appointed a clerk to be chief wages clerk, who announced his inten- tion of leaving the union on promotion, and this precipitated a strike in  the company&apos;s works.  Negotiations were opened at  once  through the  medium of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, but the situation was further complicated by the clerk in question changing his  mind, declaring his intention of remaining with the union, and coming out on strike with the rest of the men.  A conference was then held, attended by an officer of the department.   The men  accepted the firm&apos;s offer to take the clerk back as a timekeeper, with the same hours and wages as  a wages clerk, the firm undertaking to review the question of his re-employment as a wages clerk within three months from the resumption of work.                                     GENERAL.    Conference of Joint Industrial Council and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees.  A conference of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Com- mittees was held  at Montagu House on the 6th December, Mr. S. J. Pascall in the chair, Mr. J. H. Whitley, M.P., spoke of the opportunities of Councils, and pleaded for a develop- ment of the spirit of pride in industry.  The Minister emphasised the fact that the Industrial Councils  are  as yet only on the threshold of their work,  at the  same time thanking the Councils and Committees for the good work they have already done.  After some discussion it was resolved that&quot; this meeting is of opinion that the recommendation of the Provisional Committee forms  a suitable basis for an Association of National Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees, to be submitted to all Joint Industrial Councils  and Interim  Industrial Reconstruction Committees for their  consideration.&quot; This resolution was passed by the Conference of 70 delegates, with one dissentient.    In the afternoon Mr. M. R. Allard delivered an address on &quot; Unemployment Insurance, with particular reference to Special Schemes,&quot; and Mr. B.  Seebohm Rowntree  on &quot; The Possible Development of Works Committees.&apos;&apos;   Both addresses were followed by interesting discussions, unfortunately curtailed by lack of time.    Threatened Reduction of Wages (London). The National Federation of Women Workers have notified the  department that Messrs.  Charles Boyton &amp; Sons,  Ltd., pressers and stampers, had discharged all their employees who were members of any trade union, and were proposing to engage non-unionists at lower rates.  The department  communicated with the firm, and the managing director discussed the matter at Montagu House, with a representative of  the union.  Owing to the condition of trade and the fall in prices, the firm stated that they are quite unable to continue to employ their usual staff.   They agreed,however, to reconsider the whole position, and to consult their shop stewards with regardto dismissals.   They also agreed to  meet the union representatives at Montagu Housenext week to discuss the matter further.

GENERAL   DEPARTMENT.                              TRADE  BOARDS.                                  PROCEEDINGS.    Hollow-ware Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board adopted a report from the Piece-work Committee recommending the grading of male workers in the trade, and consideredthe question of proposing minimum rates for these workers.   No agreement was reached,and further consideration of the matter was deferred.  The Board agreed to request theMinister to appoint on the Board a representative of employers in the japanning section ofthe trade.    Hair, Bass and Fibre Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered a letter fromthe Minister transmitting a copy of a resolution passed by the Shoreditch employment committees on the subject of granting permits of exemption for short periods, and adopted the report of the Administrative Committee thereon.  Consideration of a draft scheme  ofco-operation between the Board and Juvenile Employment Committees was deferred.   TheBoard resumed consideration of a motion to increase by 15 per cent, all minimum rates  ofwages in operation.  After prolonged discussion the motion was withdrawn.    Wholesale Mantle and Costume Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to issue a Proposal to  vary  minimum rates of wages for male and female workers, and, in thisconnection, the Wholesale Mantle and Costume  Manufacturers&apos; Federation undertook  torecommend their members to bring into operation in the case of adult workers, other thanpackers, warehousemen and porters, 50 per cent,  of the proposed increase as from the firstpay-day after  the 1st January, 1921.  The Board considered a letter from the minister on the subject of the proposed amendment of the definition of the women&apos;s clothing tradein the Trade Boards (Women&apos;s Clothing) Order,  1919, together with the proposed reviseddefinition, and agreed to inform the Minister that it would be desirable, in the interests of theTrade Boards concerned, for him to summon a conference of the various Boards affectedby the change.  A committee was established to  consider the question  of the employmentof learners in the trade.    The  Administrative Committee considered,  in conjunction with a repiesentative  ofthe Juvenile Branch, the question of co-operation  between the Board and Juvenile AdvisoryCommittees, and agreed that consideration of the position of learners should be continued at the next meeting.  The  committee considered a letter received from the  Minister,  inreply to the request  of the Board that the Minister should amend the Regulations so as  toprovide  for voting by sides.  They recommended the Board to draw the attention of theMinister to the fact  that such amendment had been made in the case of the Ready-made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board ; that not only were the two Boards closely connected, but that certain representatives of employers and. workers were common to bothBoards,  and that the Board had now gained  experience of the working of the method of voting.  A letter from the Minister relating to the granting of permits of exemption for short  periods was considered, together with a resolution of the Shoreditch employment committees, and it was agreed to recommend the Board to reply to the effect that, while theBoard are fully aware of the desirability of granting permits of exemption for as long periodsas circumstances warrant, they feel they must reserve to themselves their rights under theTrade Boards Acts of considering each application on its merits, and  of determining theconditions under which permits shall be  granted.    Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered proposals submitted bythe representatives of workers for the variation of the minimum rates of wages in operation.Consideration  of the matter was postponed.  The Board agreed to issue a  Proposal  to fix minimum rates of wages for certain classes of apprentices in the cigar trade, and to vary the overtime rates at present in operation for male and female workers, and for male and female apprentices to cigar sorting and bundling.    A letter from the Minister relating to  the granting of permits of exemption for short periods was considered, together with a  resolution of the Shoreditch  Employment Com-mittee, and it was agreed that a reply be sent, which was couched in terms similar to thatof the Wholesale Mantle and Costume Trade Board.    The Administrative Committee considered a reference from the Board with regard tothe variation of the minimum rates in operation, in their application to rural areas, and alsoa report from  the Apprenticeship Sub-Committee with regard to the proposed scheme  of
General Department-continued.apprenticeship for male and female apprentices.  The committee agreed to recommend tothe Board that minimum rates should be proposed for male and female learners in substitu-tion for those at present in operation.   The committee considered a letter from the minister with regard to the question of granting permits of exemption for short periods to disabled ex-Service men, and agreed to reply to the effect that, where permits were issued for short periods, it was generally for the purpose  of giving temporary protection pending furtherinformation, and that  sympathetic consideration would always be given to applicationsmade by disabled ex-Service men.   The committee considered a letter from the  IndustrialSchool, Leeds, with regard to the question of counting training in such schools  as part ofthe period of apprenticeship for the purpose of the Trade Board&apos;s determinations.  they agreed to recommend that one year&apos;s experience of every two, in any school where there isa class for retail bespoke tailoring approved by theBoard, should be counted for the purposeof ascertaining the minimum rate at which such apprentices are to be paid.    Jute Trade Board (Great Britain). The Skilled Workers&apos; Committee prepared a revisedmethod of calculating piece-rates for weavers, and made arrangements for a sub-committeeto attend at certain jute mills to obtain information in respect of disputed points.    In view of the uncertain future state of trade in Bootle, it was agreed that no actionbe taken at present in  respect of the  Board&apos;s Notice of Proposal, dated the 27th August,to vary certain minimum rates of wages for female workers in the County Borough of Bootle.Consideration of motions to increase general minimum  time-rates and to alter the basis ofthe general  minimum time-rates, and the question of fixing general minimum piece-ratesfor  weavers, was deferred until the next meeting.   The Board adopted, with certain modifications, a scheme of learnership for female weavers prepared by the LearnershipCommittee,  and their recommendation in respect of  co-operation with  Juvenile AdvisoryCommittees.  The Administrative  Committee decided  to recommend the Board to agreeto the Ministers suggestion that it was desirable that permits of exemption should be granted for as long a period as seems to the Board  advisable.             FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.    Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving Trade Board (Ireland). The Minister has made an Order, dated the 29th November, confirming general minimum time-rates, piece-workbasis  time-rates and overtime rates as varied for male and female workers in  the trade,and has specified the 13th December as the date from which these rates are effective.          The general minimum time-rates are, for male workers, 21 and under 22 years of age, Is. per       hour; for male workers, 22 years of age and upwards, Is. l\d. per hour;  and for female workers,       18 years of age and upwards, lid.  per hour;  lower rates being fixed for younger workers.  The       piece-work basis time-rates are Is. id. per  hour for male workers and SfcL per hour for female workers.          The overtime rates fixed for male and female time-workers are, for the first two hours of overtime       on any day except Sunday and statutory holidays, time-and-a-quarter ; for overtime after the first       two hours, time-and-a-half;  for  all hours worked on Sunday and statutory holidays, double-time.       All hours worked in any week in excess of 48 or on any day, not being Sunday or  a statutory       holiday, in excess of 9, or 5 in the case of Saturday, must be paid at overtime rates.  The overtime       rates fixed for male  and  female piece-workers are  one-quarter, one-half or the  whole of the       appropriate piece-work basis time-rates,  according as the overtime rate payable would have been       time-and-a-quarter, time-and-a-half, or double-time, respectively, had the worker been employed       on time-work, in addition to piece-rates each of which would yield, in the circumstances of the case,       to an ordinary worker, not less than the appropriate piece-work basis time-rate.    Coffin  Furniture and Cerement Making Trade Board (Great Britain). The minister had made  an Order, dated the 6th December,  confirming general minimum time-rates,piece-work basis time-rates and overtime  rates as varied for male workers, 21 years of age and over, and has specified the 13th December as the date from which these rates areeffective.           The general minimum time-rates are 80s., 87s. Qd., and 93s. Qd. for dressers and stampers ;       81s. 6^., 90s. Qd., and 95s. 6d. for polishers and planishers, including wheelers ;  and 56s.  6d., 63s. Qd.,       and 69s. 6d. for those employed on packing, rough warehousing, and despatching or other operations,       the higher rates being subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions regarding experience in the       trade as laid down  by the Board. The piece-work basis time-rates as varied are 12  per cent, above       the general minimum time-rates  set out above.  The overtime rates as varied are calculated in the       same manner as those at present in operation,    (B 16753)                                                                  4 T
General  Department-continued.    Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board have issued a notice of Proposal dated the 7th December to fix general minimum time-rates for certainclasses of male and female workers.          The rates proposed for workers, 21 years of age and over, employed wholly or mainly as clerks       or as cash-desk workers in retail shops, range, in the City of London and the Metropolitan Police       District, from 62s. to 74s. for male clerks, from 41s. to 50s. for female clerks, from 62s. to 70s. for       male cash-desk workers and from 41s. to 47s. for  female cash-desk workers ;  in all rural and urban       districts and municipal boroughs,  other than  those above, with a population of less than 5,000,       from 54s. to 62s. for male clerks, from 36s. to 42s. for female  clerks, from 54s. to 58s. for male cash-       desk workers, and from 36s. to 39s. for female cash-desk workers  ; and in all other areas from 60s.       to 72s. for male clerks, from 40s.  to 48s. for  female clerks, from 60s. to 68s. for male cash-desk       workers, and from 40s. to 45s. for female cash-desk workers  ; with lower rates for workers under       21 years of age in each case.

General Outlook. Reports for the week generally reflect a deepening of the depressionin almost every branch of industry.  In view of the indications of difficulties arising fromthe rates of exchange, a scarcity of new orders, and drastic short-time working, a somewhatpessimistic view is taken of the prospects of an early revival.    Shipbuilding and Other. Industries. With regard to  the  shipbuilding  and  alliedindustries, the position in Scotland has not changed appreciably.   The outlook at Dum-barton, where a contract for two large passenger ships for a Belgian firm has been cancelled,is not regarded as favourable.  On Tyneside, a considerable number of shipyard workers engaged  on  new work have been suspended owing to shortage of material and inclementweather.  On the Tees the position is reported to  be more favourable, as a number of menwho have been idle owing to a shortage of material have re-started work.  The supply ofmaterials, however, in this area is somewhat irregular, and work is frequently interrupted.    In the  Liverpool district the recovery  from  the effects of the shipwrights&apos;  strike isslow, and there is very little indication of  a return to normal conditions.   In the ship-repairing industry, there is no change to report at Barry or Newport.  At Swansea work is not so good, and at Bute Docks the number of unemployed shipyard workers on theregister has increased by 100 during the week.    In the North-Western Division, unemployment  has  been greatly accentuated by thedecision  of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations to recommend all users of American cotton to curtail production by 50 per cent. This recommendation appears
to have been acted on immediately, as in several places, such as Preston and Oldham, wherethe mills stopped on Friday night the operatives claimed benefit on the following morning.    Unemployment is abnormal in  the iron and steel industry  at Sheffield owing to ascarcity of orders.  The depression in this industry is stated to be more acute in the NorthLincolnshire area than in any other district in the country.  From Llanelly it is reportedthat three tinplate and steel  works are on short time, and that about 2,500 employees ofthe largest firm in the town have been given a month&apos;s notice.    Extensive unemployment and under-employment is still a feature of the wool, textile,hosiery, lace and boot and shoe trades, but hopes are entertained of a revival in the hosieryand boot trades in the New Year.  Employment  in the pottery industry continues good,but the demand for additional workers does not compare favourably with that before thecoal strike.    Industrial Developments. At Llanidloes a small woollen mill has been bought by amanufacturer who  intends to adapt the looms for weaving  tweeds.  A new quarry hasbeen opened by the Bwlchgwyn Roadstone Co., Ffrith, near Wrexham, which, whendeveloped, will probably employ about  50 workmen.   The Stanton Iron Works Co., Ltd.,Ilkeston, are proceeding with their developments for  the manufacture of  reinforced con-crete pipes.  The actual manufacture is, however, still in the experimental stage, and thelabour  is at present being drawn from other branches of their  establishment.    Labour  Reductions. From Wolverhampton  it is  reported that the Sunbeam MotorCar Co., Ltd.,  are discharging 1,000 men.  The Richmond Glass Works have closed;  80workpeople have been thrown out of employment.  Further reductions,  affecting about500 workpeople, have been made by Messrs. Huntley &amp; Palmers, Ltd., Reading.    Shortage of Labour. The position in London as regards the demand for carpenters  hasbeen greatly eased as a result of the shipyard joiners&apos; dispute ; many who were engaged on ship work are now applying for vacancies on housing schemes.  The position, however,in regard to bricklayers and plasterers, both in London and the provinces, is unchanged.    Shortage of Material. It is reported that firms engaged  on housing schemes at Ilfordare prevented from employing their full quota of labour  owing to a shortage of timber.At Aberdare, Messrs. N. B. Allen, brick manufacturers, have reported that unless they  can obtain a normal supply of coal they will have to suspend a number of their employees.    Transport. Labour conditions  at Avonmouth are affected by the Bristol transportworkers&apos; strike and the dispute between the seamens&apos; and the dockers&apos; unions, with theresult  that no ships are sailing from the port.   The  strike  of tug-men still continues atMiddlesbrough, and work in the docks is practically at  a standstill.  At Grimsby largenumbers of permanent and  temporary  transport workers are idle, owing to trade in thegoods department being practically at a standstill.  Hull report that, owing to government control over the export of coal, and slackness in the timber and grain trades, there is a dailysurplus of between 1,300 and 1,400 transport workers. Women&apos;s Employment.    General Situation. Increase  of short time  and unemployment is reported from all sides, more especially in the cotton and woollen textiles.   Systematised arrangements forclaiming unemployment insurance benefit are on  the increase.    The 41 London Exchanges account for over 31,400 of the 100,000 women on the  live register for the United Kingdom on the 19th November.  Of these, over 8,000 are registered in domestic categories, including 6,700 daily workers, over 6,000 in the needlework trades,and over 1,300 as clerks.    Heavy unemployment is  also reported  from the Birmingham area, where the  liveregisters of five Exchanges amount to over 7,000.   Of these, over 4,000 are in the engineer-ing group.   At Leeds there are over 5,000 on the live register, of whom over 4,000 aretailoresses.    Local  Reports. The North-Western Division report that unemployment is rapidlyassuming serious proportions owing to the continued depression of the cotton industry. There  is also  depression in  the hatting industry at  Denton; in the waterproof garment making trade  in Manchester  ; and generally throughout the sewing trades.    Increasing depression and short time is reported by the  Yorkshire and East Midlands Division from all the woollen and cotton textile centres.   In Brighou.se short-time arrange- ments in the  cotton mills will lead to approximately 1,200  women claiming benefit.   At Bradford large numbers of  textile operatives are unemployed or on short time, and no improvement  is expected for several months.     (B 16753)                                                           4  T 2
    The situation in the lace, hosiery, wholesale clothing  and underclothing industriesremains unchanged.  All factories  are on short time, and many women are out of work.    The staple industries in the South Midlands and Eastern Division, namely, the boot,hosiery, wholesale clothing, straw hat and silk trades, remain depressed, and there is muchshort time being worked.   At Kettering between two and three thousand claims to unem-ployment insurance benefit are expected before Christmas in the boot and underclothingindustries.  In Leicester  many hosiery factories are gradually closing down, with no definite prospect of re-opening.    In the West Midlands Division the unemployment situation is also developing  Theserious unemployment in the Birmingham area has been referred to above, and at Coventrya number of engineering, motor and cycle firms are on short time.  There is no revival inthe clothing or silk industries.  Employment in the pottery trade  continues good on thewhole, although Hartley report a depression in purely decorative work.   In. Worcester thelive register has risen from 262 to 409 during the week.    The severe unemployment in  the factory areas of London continues.  At  Deptfordthe live register now stands at 2,366, with 2,000 claims for unemployment insurance benefit.The manager states that the local condition of trade is disastrous.   Similar accounts comefrom Bermondsey, Camberwell, Canning Town, East Ham,  Leyton, Poplar, Whitechapeland Stratford.  The clothing industries remain slack, and Great Marlborough Street reportthat many millinery and dressmaking firms are working part time.    In the South-Western Division, the registers at the Bristol and Bath Exchanges are affected by the strike of transport  workers.  Gloucester report that there are 500 women on the live register, many of whom are married.    Depression is now feared in the tinplate industry in Wales, which hitherto has notbeen seriously affected by the general trade depression.    In Scotland,  slackness and short time continue in the woollen and cotton textile industries and in the hosiery, flax, linen, calico printing, and wholesale clothing trades.  AtDundee about 9,000 jute workers are now on short time, working three days a week.                      LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.    Employment and Resettlement. The question of the local  arterial and other  road schemes was discussed by the Edinburgh Committee, who instructed their UnemploymentSub-Committee to carry out work in connection therewith.  To  prevent overlapping,recommendation was also made to the Leith Committee  to nominate  a similar  sub-committee, to act as a joint committee for interviewing and  selecting applicants.    In connection with the Leith  dock  extension scheme, it was recommended that thecommittee should be associated with the joint deputation  from the Dundee and LeithTown  Councils in  approaching the  Harbours and  Docks Commission, with a view toexpediting the proposed work.    The Walham Green Committee suggest that,  in view of the large  amount  of unem-ployment, the Underground and other railway companies should ascertain the number oftheir employees who are working for other employers in their spare time, and dischargefrom their employment men who are holding two men&apos;s jobs.    Publicity. The Barrow Committee suggest that the National Clearing House Gazetteshould be circulated to all public  libraries  and exhibited on special stands set apart forthat purpose.  The committee state that such action would result in a far greater numberof vacancies being notified to Exchanges by employers.    Miscellaneous. The Torquay Committee gave further consideration to the&apos;position inthe area in connection with the shortage of cement, and it was decided to bring to thenotice  of the Minister that, while British cement was being sent to  Belgium, that country was also exporting the same material to this country.      OUT-OF-WORK DONATION  AND  UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.    Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to informa-tion received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 2nd December,show 410,515 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  352,066 3s. 9d.

During the week ending the 3rd December the Appointments Departmentplaced 480 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known tohave been placed to 46,048.   Of these, 6,268 have been placed through the agency of thedepartments Interviewing Boards.  Applications were registered from  771  ex-Servicemen and 26  civilians.  The number of candidates available for  appointments on  the3rd December was 11,924 ex-Service men and 1,380 civilians.  At the  same date, 1,165&quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 572 having been registered duringthe week.                    BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.    Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 3rd Decemberthe Appointments Department  received applications for training under this scheme from36 officers and men of similar educational qualifications, of which 21 were for training of the    (B 16753)                                                           4  T 3                              JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.    Apprentices %n the Building Trade. Considerable interest is still being shown in thisquestion, and the Joint Industrial&quot; Councils scheme is being used largely as a basis fordiscussion.    At Colchester the question of increasing the number of apprentices in the trade isbeing considered.  With seven local firms there were stated to be 168 skilled men employed,10 improvers and 10 apprentices.  The master builders are being invited to consider thequestion.    The secretary of the Walsall Juvenile Advisory Committee was invited to attend a recent meeting of the Midland Centre  of the Federation of Building Trades Employers,which was held to discuss the national scheme.  After a discussion on the scheme, repre-sentatives were appointed to attend a joint conference with representatives of the operatives.    Employment in  Domestic Service. The demand  for domestic service is  stated to besteadily increasing at Preston, and a special sub-committee has been formed to deal withthis work.  Schemes embodying minimum wages and other conditions have been formu-lated at Dudley and Pembroke Dock.   In each case a form of agreement has been drawnup.  The Dudley scheme provides that the wages of a maid who holds a certificate of having successfully passed through a domestic course at the day or evening schools, shallbe 6d. per week in advance of the usual scale.    The Edgware Road Juvenile Advisory Committee are  arranging to co-operate with theMetropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants in placing girls in  residentdomestic service.  A joint conference has recently been held.    Effect of Trade Board Rates. The operation of Trade Board rates is still having an adverse effect on the number of vacancies for juveniles, especially in the tailoring and alliedtrades.  Specific instances  of  dismissals have been  received from Lincoln;   the wholequestion is being taken up  with the Trade Boards concerned.  The position is also acutein Dudley, where several employers have determined to employ as few learners as possible.    The question was discussed at a recent conference  between representatives of  theSouthampton Juvenile Advisory Committee, the Southampton Branch of the NationalFederation of Merchant Tailors, and the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses.It was suggested that a solution of the difficulty might be  found if a scheme of apprentice-ship  were generally adopted in  the trade.   The conference accordingly decided that ajoint committee should be formed to consider the  matter further, and if necessary, to formulate a scheme.

Deducting cancellations and  withdrawals, 28,261  applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 49,993 for training  of the type provided by other Government Departments.  The Interviewing Boards have  dealt with 27,536 applications, of which 23,102 have been recommended.  The Grants  Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 21,966 applications,  and sanctioned grants in 18,145 cases.     Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 3rd December the Appoint-  ments Department received  250 applications for training under this  scheme, bringing the  total  number of applications to 820.  Of these, 51  have since been cancelled, and grants  have  been sanctioned in 35 cases.  At the same date, 193 training vacancies were at the  disposal of the department, 65 having been registered during the week.     Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Department  have  dealt with a total of 942 cases, in 443 of which the training sanctioned is provided by  the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments.  Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 232 cases,  and abandoned training in 42 ;  146 are still in training and 23 are awaiting training.                          TRAINING  DEPARTMENT.                              INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.  Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.     Statistics. On the 7th December 25,044  men were in training, as against 24,860 on  the 30th November and 24,970 on the 9th November.  The number of men placed in training  during the week was  584.  There  were 16,264 men awaiting training, the  corresponding  totals for the 30th November and the 9th November being 16,751 and 17,329, respectively.  The number of men whose training had been completed since  the 1st  August, 1919, was&apos;  21,916, the totals for the 30th November and  the 9th November being  21,516 and 20,137,  respectively.     The increase in the number of men in training may to some extent be due to the fact  that,  in consequence of prevailing industrial conditions and the difficulty of obtaining im-  provership vacancies, the number  of extensions of training periods has been on the increase  recently.  At the same time,  an undoubted factor has been the recent increase in Govern-  ment  Instructional Factory  facilities.  It would appear that the process of clearing the  waiting lists has  been of  late accelerated rather satisfactorily, and that  the machinery tor dealing with outstanding cases is working well in most divisions.

For the time being the  situation with regard to improvership  vacancies, which, owing to trade depression, are now  very difficult to find, has been relieved,  sanction having been obtained to continue for a limited period the training of men both in  factories and other centres, after their normal period of institutional instruction has expired.  The necessity for such extensions is much regretted, as there is a general consensus of opinion that it  is  desirable, in the interests  of good  training,  that men should be placed with  employers as soon as they can fairly rank as improvers.     Hotel  Workers. A proposal has  recently  been  submitted  by the Divisional Director tor Essex and East Anglia for training men  in various branches of hotel work.  A scheme has been worked out in considerable detail with the  assistance of an expert, and it appears possible that a large number of men could be accepted, and that 200 would not be too many for a start.   It is essential, however, that the course  should be under fully competent direc- tion, and that someone with a high reputation in  the hotel world should be in charge. The course should be  very thorough and for this purpose its normal duration should be fixed at 12 months.  The Claydon Factory, which has an up-to-date laundry and kitchen, and is residential, appears to be  well adapted for this experiment.   A rough estimate suggests that the scheme can be carried out at a comparatively inexpensive rate.     Dental Mechanics. The War Office and the Admiralty have been requested to consider the possibility of employing men trained by the Ministry as dental mechanics, as, owing to the demobilisation of dental mechanics in the Forces and the apparently increasing number of women entering the trade,  considerable difficulty is being experienced in placing men who have completed their course  satisfactorily.     Arrangements with South Africa. The question of the training of members of the South African Forces in this country and  of ex-Imperials in the Union is under discussion with the
High Commissioner.   It is recognised that, if the South African authorities desire definiteaction to be taken, it must be on the distinct understanding that it will only be possibleto give  institutional training in this country, and that South Africans in training mustreturn to their own country for the completion of their training.     Government Instructional Factories. It is expected that the Blackheath Factory willopen before the close of the year, with a class of 20 cabinet makers.   The Shepherds BushFactory, which opened at the end of November, has now 89 men in training.  The brick-layers from Sarisbury Court have completed the Memorial Clock Tower at Hamble, and havenow started on foundation work in the gas plant house.  The carpenters are manufacturingcupboards for the factories at Winchester, Reading and Oxford, and are carrying  out a contract for 50 oak garden gates, and the upholsterers are repairing factory furniture, andfurniture sent in from Southampton firms.  The number of men in training here has risen to 481.     Arrangements have been made whereby the men taking the electrical course at Birtleyattend daily on the German Dreadnought Nassau, lying at Elswick in the hands of Messrs.Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co., Ltd.  She has a remarkable equipment of electrical machinery,and provides exceptional training facilities.   Negotiations are proceeding with a view to securing an order to recondition a considerable amount of the plant.     National Trade Advisory Committees: Cane, Basket and Willow Industry. A meetingof the Committee was held at Bristol on the 9th December.  A discussion took place as tothe  number of men to each instructor in the  special  workshops set up by the  Ministry,which  has hitherto been ten to one.   It was contended  that it was impossible for  aninstructor to deal effectively with more than  five trainees, as in  ordinary workshops.  Itwas unanimously resolved  that, in the opinion of the  Committee,  the rule applicable to ordinary workshops should be  adopted.   A question was raised as  to the position of atrainee  in the case of a shop working short time.   The view was expressed by the employersand trade union representatives that, as it was the  universal practice of the trade thatapprentices should always work full time, the  disabled man in training must be considered in the same category, and under no circumstances should the continuity of training be broken.     National Trade Advisory Committees: Printing. A meeting of the Committee washeld on the 7th December.  The Committee endorsed the suggestion of the London LocalTechnical Advisory Committee that H.M. Stationery Office should be asked to take a certainnumber of trainees in their establishments.     Local Technical Advisory Committees  :  Gold, Silver, and Allied Trades. The Romfordcommittee for watch and clock repairing, at their inaugural meeting on the 3rd December,decided that, for the present, twenty-four disabled men should be trained at the Govern-ment Instructional Factory:  the number will  be reviewed  at  a  later date,  when the divisional Director has given particulars of his waiting list.Apprenticeships  Interrupted by Service.     Statistics. Up to the  8th  December, agreements had been  received at headquarters in respect of 45,003 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctionedin  respect of 43,062  apprentices, employed by 17,153 employers.   The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 14,634.     Wages. The difficulty in  regard to the prescribed rate caused by the existence of several grades of workmen in  the brass trade at Birmingham515 remains unsettled.  Ap-apparently the adoption of the rate for the middle grade has been proposed as a compromise,and this will probably be acceptable to the employers. It maybe possibly adopted eventuallyby the  workpeople also, but at present they are strongly inclined to insist upon the  rate ofthe highest grade.     Applications. In the London  and South-Eastern area the number of unmated  ap-prentices, who cannot find employers, is reported to be small.   In the Northern area, inspite of the success already secured, local headquarters continue to receive numerous requestsfrom Employment Exchanges to assist in placing such apprentices.     Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. The resistance of certain master plumbers at Edinburghto the adoption of Lord Hunter&apos;s award was very manifest at the recent joint conference on special cases, and little progress was made.   Local  headquarters  state that 29 of these                   * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 21, 20th November, page 597.
 cases could have been readily disposed of, but, owing to the tactics adopted, only 10 were decided in  4-1 hours.  A minority of the employers concerned were ready to accept the scheme, and only desired certain information.  The great majority seemed determined to put obstacles in the way and apparently desire to re-open the whole question of its adoption.     Training in Operation. Local headquarters confirm  previous reports of the satis- factory working of  the  measures to  ensure  adequate training of apprentices under  the pottery scheme, which have been taken by the Wages and Conditions Committee of the Joint Industrial Council  for the industry.     Unemployment. At Redruth, in addition to the unmated apprentices, a number of others are out of work, but the position has recently been relieved by the emigration from the district  of 200 men, among whom are some apprentices.   The suspension of painters at Aberdeen is reported to be due to purely seasonal causes, apparently of a normal character. Consequently the proposed class at the Robert Gordon Technical Institute will last only for 12 weeks, by which time it is hoped that there will be ample work for the apprentices.     The general condition of employment,  which is likely to affect apprentices under  the scheme,  or  seeking employers to bring them under it, is reported to be growing worse, rather than better, at Leicester.   The improvement expected after the close of the coal strike  has not been  realised.     Institutional Training. Efforts in the South-Western area to utilise the accommodation available  for engineering training at Portsmouth have so far met with very moderate success, though a few men are now being sent there.  Difficulties continue to be experienced in transferring to Portsmouth any of the unemployed engineers at Bristol.  Great interest in their case has been shown by the Bristol Employment Committee. General Training.    Apprenticeship:  Building. Further progress is reported in regard  to the national scheme.   The  North-East Coast Federation of  Building Trades Employers,  covering Northumberland, Durham and part of Yorkshire, will consider the scheme on the 14th December, and will hold  a meeting of representatives of all their branches in January, by which time it is hoped to arrange a joint meeting with the operatives.   At Bolton, a joint meeting of the representatives of the industry, the local education authority and  other persons and bodies interested,, have decided to establish an Apprenticeship Committee. The scheme has  been received warmly by employers, workpeople and  the local education authority in the Dewsbury and Batley district, and favourably, though with more caution, at Keighley. With  the  termination  of  the  unauthorised strike at Rugby, negotiations have been re-opened between employers  and operatives  at  Leicester.  The latter are favourable to the scheme, and desire a joint meeting with the employers, if possible before Christmas.  At Luton, difficulties are  still experienced with unprogressive employers, butthe president and secretary of their association are favourable.  A meeting of the operatives is being arranged.    Attention is drawn by a Canterbury firm to difficulties  in apprenticing boys as brick-layers and plasterers.  Frequently,  owing to bad weather or seasonal slackness, there is nothing for  them to do.   They cannot be  provided with employment in the shop, like apprentices in other  branches, and, if they  are kept idle, discontent is caused among thelatter.    Apprenticeship : Farriery. Evidence is available that the decline in farriers&apos; work ispartially balanced by an increase in general  smithing.  In the North-Western area this increase seems even greater than the decrease.  In districts where there are housing schemes,there is even a tendency to substitute horse for motor transport, which, owing to the softness of the ground in new building plots, cannot approach close enough to the work.  In the North  and South-Eastern area, the few indentured apprentices are with firms who dowheelwrighting, or blacksmithing, as well as farriery, which, by itself, is not thought toprovide sufficient scope for training.   In the  West Midlands, the more progressive firms,whilst admitting the decline in farriery, consider that with proper attention to training, itcan be rehabilitated on a  smaller scale.

APPENDIX.                          QUESTIONS IN  PARLIAMENT.     The following extracts from the  Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested. Business Training:  Ex-Service Men.     Sir R. Newman asked the Minister of Labour whether he will consider the claims of ex-Service men who, on being demobilised, endeavoured to start in life without applying for a State training grant, but who, having failed, now desire to obtain some professional instruction, but find that,  not having applied for the  grant within a certain number of months, they are debarred from receiving any assistance from the State, though had they at once on being demobilised  applied for a grant before trying to start life without it they would have been entitled to receive the same.  .   Dr. Macnamara: With the permission of my hon. friend, I will have the answer to this question printed in the Official Report.     The following is the answer referred to:     To meet the claims of  ex-Service  men of the category referred to by my hon. friend, the following facilities remain available :     Until the 30th April, 1921, ex-Service officers and men of similar educational qualifica- tions may  apply for assistance under the Business Training Scheme  recently announced in this House.  In initiating this scheme I had in view the relief of the  type of case referred to by my hon. friend.  Under Article 7 of the Royal Warrant, any ex-officer who had not received  State assistance, but finds his normal occupation debarred him  owing to War disability, may receive professional or  agricultural training under the appropriate Govern- ment department, not exceeding one year.  There is no time-limit for applications under the Industrial Training Scheme, the scope of which is well known.   During the life of the Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme, special concessions were afforded to ex-Service men of the category referred  to, and where, in view of the changed  circumstances, such men found it necessary to apply for State aid after the failure of their personal endeavours, the regulations as to time-limit for application were relaxed in their favour.   This scheme,however, having accomplished its object, is now virtually at an end.   The Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Department is authorised to consider applications from ex-Service men for grants to resettle them  in civil life, notwithstanding that  the period of 12 months fromdischarge or demobilisation has elapsed, this time-limit having been extended to meet the type of case in question, and this extension remains in force until the 31st  December, 1920, up to which date applications for assistance will be sympathetically considered and dealt with by this Department. (8th  December.)
