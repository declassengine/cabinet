184^s^-&quot;^      In October I received a Report frca the StandingJoint Committee of Representatives of Local Education Authoritiesand the National union of Teachers which had come to an agree-ment as to the adoption of Standard Scales of Salaries for teachers in public Elementary Schools.          I have discussed with the Chancellor of the exchequer the attached reply dealing with the Report generally, and Iunderatend that he raises no objection to its issue.  In viewhowever of the Cabinet Resolution, I desire the sanction of theCabinet to its issue.          It will be seen that in paragraphs 9 and 10 I make certain reservations as to the.Committee^ recommendations,and these paragraphs are perhaps the most material.        -  The matter is urgert as my reply has been longdelayed, and I am being pressed by the Local Authorities to define my attitude.H.A*L.PISKER.22.12.20.
                                          -December 1020.    Tear lord Burnham,              Cn the 15th October I ao3mo?-ledicre&amp; your letter of    the 13th enclosing the Report of the 30th September of the    Standing Joint Committee upon Standard Scales of Salaries for    Teachers in Public Slenentary Schools,, and reserved such a    considered reply as the importance of the matter requires,    I -/ill no&apos;&quot; fe,sk you to communicate to the ilembers of the Committee    the following observations on their Report end on the situation   . to &quot;&apos;hioh it &apos;7ill give rise,1,             I do not dissent from the view of the Committee    which is emphasised by the representatives of the Local    Education Authorities in their latter to their constituents,    that it v/as necessary or at all events very desirable to    proceed, beyond the point marked by the formulation of the    Provisional Minimum Scale, towards the &quot;orderly and progressive    solution&quot;, of the salary problem in Public Slementary Schools,    Their First Report, vhile securing a 1 period of peace&apos; for    Authorities whioh adopted the Provisional minimum Scale, left    1$ opon to the individual Authorities to continue or adopt a    higher scale (to. *vhloh a similar period of peace vould attach)    by agreement  with their teachers: this liberty van indeed    inherent in the idea of a/provisional minimum&apos;. I understand    that,  on merits,  it *vae the vietv of the Committee that Just asRt, Hon, The Viscount Burnham,3,21.
in many largo areas scales much above the Provisional minimumScale alreody existed, eo the improvement of salary aoalas incertain areas *vaa proper and inevitable.  On the other hand the period of peace secured by the adoption of the First Beporwas in acme aasea only a short one, and I gather that just asBoard had been imprefiued by the groat&apos; difference between scalemade before the Committee ^as set up, so the Committee were impressed by tho embarrassment which was likely to arise fromthe multiplication of hap-ha^ard and po3Bibly precipitate locasettlements made without reference to any accepted standards avfithout any guidance from the ^Standing Joint Committee,          Tho present Bepcrt of the Committee endeavours to afford such guidance and sttaches to settlements effected r/itlthe approval of the Committee a 1 period of peace&apos; prolonged tt1st April 1025*  In the interests of education this prolongatilis a great advantage. The Report also recommends the &quot;adoptioncf a minimum 1 carry over&apos; from old to new scales suread overthr^o financial years.          I observe that the Committee undertake &quot;;ithin sixmonths of the date of their Beport, ito, before 31st March1921. to &quot;settle and publish a Schedule shotting the Standard&quot;Scale  which is, in their opinion, appropriate&apos;to each Local&quot;Education Authority, due regard being had to Agreements *rri&quot;ed at under Sections 16 and. 17 cf this Beport.&quot;          Those Sections contemplate the making, within four months of the date of the Report, i.e, before the 31st Januarin each area of provisional agreements &quot;as to which Standard Siis appropriate to the area&quot;, the notification of suoh local
 agreements to  the Ccjoaittee,  and the &quot;confirmation of ovory such provisional agreement or otherwise&quot;  after full consideration of the representations of the Local Education Authorities and Teachers concerned.      While the adoption of a Standard Scalo is net treated as obligatory before the expiration of the moratorium scoured under the arrangements of the First Report,  the Authorities&apos; Panel, partly I imagine in order to avoid an interval of controversy, appeal tc Authorities generally tc adept Standard Scales without delay, and Standard Scales confirmed, by the Committee aro to take effect as from a date not later than 1st April 1921.          So far as the Report rests on the general view that progress towards the establishment of the teaching profession on a sound basis  is most likely tc be achieved,  is most  likely tc command the support cf public opinion &apos;(en v/hich progress in the last resort depends),  and is least likely tc  provoke reaction, if it is made  *per gradu^&apos; and not !per salturn1,  it is commanded tc me by my own experience of affairs  and knowledge of the difficulties of the present situation.  While  I do not dispute the necessity  of admitting so&amp;e iceasuro of elasticity in the methods of applying the Scales, I a&amp; disposed  to look at the series of scales,  which has now been completed by the formulation of Scale 1,, as indicating as a rule the next  Btep which should be taken in the several areas,  where any  change  is necessary.          It is obvious,  as you point  out,  that this  Report still&apos;leaves tie Committee &quot;a considerable part to play in  the process of giving effect to the Report  and a considerable share  of responsibility for its accomplishment&quot;,  and you express  your own opinion, which is entitled  to  great respect,   that the Committee is,  through its constitution and  tire qualities which it  has developed,   well suited to perform the task which
                                                          0  Iit still has to face.                                        ^     I accept this view, &quot;both &amp;s regards tho quality of theCOi*unittee and its capacity by a continuance cf its work tocontribute to the consolidation of the public system ofeducation.  I regard the establishment of a C04fcs.ittee orCoiKLittees of this kind as a natural development of the system!established by the Act of 1902,  and as helping to close up thlgap between the numerous Local Authorities and the CentralAuthority,    I therefore am sincerely anxious that the Committee should!continue in existence and should continue to operate:  and tholI feel it my duty to qualify in several respects nr^r general acceptance of the Report,  I should greatly regret if I weredeprived of the Committee&apos;s assistance in the solution of anextrelely difficult problem.         The Co^ittee and its constituents will recognize thaiboth preset conditions and future prospects afford grounds foijgrave anxiety as to the financial position of the Country, or at all events for great caution in tho acceptance of co&apos;U: it;cenlthe extent of which is not ascertainablc  Under the present  system of grants in aid of Elementary Education,  for which was responsible,  the contributions of the State arc related tl                                      -   .and determined by the expenditure of the Local &quot;Education Authoiies,,  There is now &amp; financial partnership between the State aithe Local Authorities of quite a different nature from that wliexisted when the expansion of local expenditure did not carry with it an expansion of grants.    If the Report of the Co^&amp;ittee is actod upon,  it will notbe possible for anyone to estimate for some ti&amp;e to co&amp;e,  evenprovisionally,  the cost to all the Local. Authorities in the aggregate of the adoption of Standard Scales,  nor the cost to                                4.
   O the  Exchequer. 7.          If effect is  to  &quot;be given  to the financial relations      &quot;between the Board and  the Local  Education Authorities  contem-      plated by the Act o^ 1918,  It is fiss^fttial  that  arrangements  to      moot increased  expenditure should bo  consistent  with the  prosen-      tation of proper and reliable estimates to  Parliament,  It  is      not  possible  to contemplate the  continuance of a situation  which      imposes&apos; upon  the Board  the choice between estimates  which may      prove insufficient through not allowing for the  independent and      subsequent     action  of Looal Education Authorities, and      speculative estimates allowing for the possibility of 3uch      action,&apos;  Apart  from, the issues raised by this  Report, I have been      convinced that  different arrangements for the  submission  of      estimates by  the Local  Education Authorities are neoessary, so      that I may not  have  to  ask the Chano*?smaller of the Exchequer  to      include in the  Board1s  estimates a sum designed  to cover     &quot;unascertained and unasoertainable inorea.se  in  the expenditure of      Local Authorities, b*         Apart from the  question  of  estimates,  I must confess that      the  &quot;time-table&quot;  embodied in  the Report appears  to me much      too  hurried.  If the Committee are, as I assume  is intended,      to consider the looal provisional agreements as  components  of     a national system and. not merely to register thrna, and are  to      construct an appropriate  Schedule covering  every area in  the  &quot;  &apos;  Country,  I do not see how they can possibly perform  the     function  of approving &quot;or otherwise&quot;  proposed  scales and   -\assigning scales  whero  none are  proposed, except on a com-     prehensive review of all  the material and of the representa-      tions  of  Lo$al &quot;Education Authorities  and local bodies ofi                                       B.
 Teachers.  A piecemeal construction of a Schedule seems to me inconsistent with the aims of the Committee.  Greater care in assigning appropriate Scales is required as Scales III and IV.  are approached,  and though the process of as- signing Scales I and II. to  the areas in which salaries are lowest may be  less laborious,  a comprehensive reviewed cannot be effected  without careful  study of all the material cir- cumstances.           Further,  I cannot  fairly commit the Chancellor of the  Exchequer  in a matter of such large financial importancewithout careful consideration  of the results of the  Committee labours, and it is therefore essential&apos; that time  should he left for the Board to  study  the  conclusions of the Coamitttee and  to  review  them as  a whole,  and to  communicate  their ob- observations tc  the  Committee, and if necessary to  discuss themwith the Committee.  It  is quite  possible  that by interchange of views at  convenient stages  the  risk of  pronounced  diver-gence of views  may  be  minimised,  and I should be  glad to sanction arrangements  for  co-operation between the BoardTsofficers and the  Committee,  if such a  course  would be  agree-able to the  Committee,          On certain points  affecting  the  operation of the scales  I feel bound  to make  reservations.   I  cannot at presencommit myself,  without further  consultation with  the  Chan-cellor of the Exchequer,  to  recognizing for  the calculation of ^rant increased  salary expenditure  incurred  by Local Bdu-cation Authorities, as from  a date  so early as  1st April  1921through the operation of standard  scales coupled with  soshort a carry-over as the Beport  contemplates, and still  less
can I commit myself to recognition of increased expenditureattributable to any acceleration of the carry-over specifiedin the Report.  On these points I must reserve a decision until, in the result of my review cf the Committee&apos;s conclusionsmentioned in the preceding paragraph, it is possible to forman idea of the financial effect cf the adoption of the Committee * 8recommendations.  I have already intimated in reply to a question in the House of Commons that where, since the issue of the Report,improved or standard scales have, been adopted locallyto take effect before their confirmation by the Committee,I cannot, at all events until they have been considered ascomponents of the comprehensive schedule which is  contemplated,commit the Board to pay grant in respect of any additional ex-penditure incurred; and moreover that I cannot in any case,and whatever the date at which an improved scale was adopted,commit the Board to the payment of grant on the basis of higherexpenditure in any area than that involved by the adoptionof Scale IV.          As regards the Scales themselves,  I do not take exception to the figures, though,  as I have said above, i cannot commit myself to the distribution of the Scales amongthe areas till I have been able to review the Committee!sSchedule.  I welcome, moreover, the prospect of checking thebewildering variety of local scales.  The reduction of thevarieties to a reasonable number of Standard Scales willgreatly facilitate administration and conduce to the consolidation of the teaching service,  I should not feel justified in refusing to recognise existing scales on theground that they do not conform to Standard Scales, but wherea change of a local scale is necessary I think that itshould be in the direction of conformity to one or other ofthe Standard Scales.  I will not anticipate the extent towhich for the purposes of the Board&apos;s administration I ma/                       7.
 (subject of course to the suitable as ailment of socles top, areas) invest these Scales with an offioial character,  but                                                             0ray disposition is to make as full use of then as is          &quot; practio able.         In conclusion-, let me explain a^in ray sense of the Board1 s obligation to the llsmbers of the Committee for  the time and trouble and labour which they have ungrudgingly given to the publio service in this important matter.  Their  task Jv&amp;e been a diffioult one; it has made great demands on  theirpersistence and endurance, and they have acted throu,;out witha full sense of their responsibility,  They have the satisfaction of having in a remarkable short time both  cleared the ground for the attaok,on this problem and made a consider- able advance in its solution.  Whatever the ultimate issue of their pioneer labours may bo, their contribution to thedevelopment of the public system of education has been substantial.u t

REPORT  BY  THE  STANDING  JOINT  COMMITTEE ON   STANDARDSCALES  OF SALARIES  FOR  TEACHERS   IN  PUBLIC   ELEMENTARY                                 SCHOOLS.To the    RIGHT HON. THE PRESIDENT OF THE        BOARD OF EDUCATION.Sir,    i. At the meeting on the 12th August, 1919, of the constituent Committeerepresenting Associations of Local Education Authorities  and the National Unionof Teachers, it was resolved inter alia     That  it is desirable to provide a central organisation, representative of LocalEducation Authorities and Teachers, to secure the orderly and progressive solutionof the salary problem in Public  Elementary Schools by agreement, on a national basis, and its correlation with a solution of the salary problem in Secondary Schools;    That for this purpose a Standing Joint Committee of representatives of LocalEducation Authorities on the one side, and the National Union of Teachers on theother, in equal numbers should be constituted ;    That  for any resolution of  the Committee the consent  of both  sides of theCommittee should be required.    2.  In their first report dated 21st November, 1919, the Standing Joint committee presented  for adoption a Provisional Minimum Scale, and later completed  this inone particular by a Supplementary Report dated 24th June, 1920,  upon the salaries of Teachers of Handicraft.    As the next step in  the orderly and progressive solution of the problem theCommittee have framed three Standard Scales, II., III. and IV., above the ProvisionalMinimum Scale.  Pending the framing of Standard Scale I. the Provisional MinimumScale retains its position.  Standard Scale I. will be framed by the Committee not later than 1st January 1921.   The Scales, together with  the conditions governingtheir application, are set  out below.                     SCALES FOR CERTIFICATED TEACHERS.3.

All grading and re-grading of existing schools for the purposes of this Report,shall be determined by reference to the average attendance  calculated on the averageof the preceding three financial years; provided that            (1) If, owing to causes beyond the control of the existing Head  Teacher       such average is found to be  below the minimum of the grade within  which       the School would  otherwise be placed at  the time of the first or subsequent       grading under these Scales, the Head Teacher shall not be thereby prejudiced       as regards grade salary, increments or maximum.           (2) If such average is  found to be above the maximum of the grade in       which the school is so placed, the Local Education Authority may :           (i)  Promote the existing Head Teacher to a higher grade; or          (ii)  At the request of the existing Head Teacher, continue him in  his post               at the same emoluments  in respect of   salary,  increments,  and               maximum, as if the School had not risen in grade ;  or         (iii)  Declare  a vacancy  in  the post of Head Teacher and consider the               existing Head Teacher  in competition with  other applicants for               appointment to the post.

All Teachers  shall be brought to their  correct positions  on  the StandardScale adopted by the  Authority in the following manner :            (a) As and from the date of the introduction of the Standard Scale any       payment due  under  previous scales,  whether by  way  of  Carry-over or of       Increment, shall cease to be due.           (6) The  correct position of the Teacher on the Standard Scale  adopted       shall be the position which  that Teacher would have  reached on the date of the       introduction of such scale by the Authority  had  that scale  been  in force       throughout his or her term of  service,  wherever rendered, full allowance       being made for any service with the Forces of the Crown.           (c) In the case of Head Teachers, the correct  position on the Standard       Scale adopted shall be ascertained by adding  to the  minimum of that  scale for       Assistant Teachers, for each complete year of service as an Assistant Teacher,       one increment on the scale applying to that service, up to the maximum of that       scale, plus one scale  increment for each  complete year of service as Head       Teacher,  together with the appropriate promotion  increment,  provided  that       the maximum  salary of the Grade on the scale is not exceeded.           (d) The  difference between  the correct Scale  position and the salary,   .    subject to (a)  above, on the existing scale at  the  date  of  the introduction       of  the Standard Scale shall be ascertained, and  the minimum  &quot; carry-over &quot;       shall be as follows :           (i)  The said difference  shall be  divided  into Three Parts,  viz. :  a First               Part which shall be one half of the said difference, and  Second and               Third Parts each of which shall be one quarter of the said difference.       .   (ii)  The First Part shall be paid as part of the salary due on and from the               date of the introduction of the Standard Scale.         (iii)  The Second and Third  Parts shall accrue  on the  first and second               anniversaries respectively  of the  introduction of  the Standard               Scale.         (dv)  On the  date on which annual increments normally accrue under the               Authority, an increment shall,  subject to any regulations  of the               Authority, accrue under the Standard Scale adopted, and thereafter               annually until the maximum of the scale is reached.
   (v) The annual  increment  is  independent  of  and  additional  to the        increments provided for in (i),  (ii) and  (iii) of  this Subsection, but        no increase shall be  granted by way  of carry-over or of annual        increment  which will  bring  a teacher  beyond his  or her correct        position on the Standard Scale.    (e) Nothing in  this Report is  intended to preclude an Authority fromdealing specially, for the purposes of the &quot; Carry-over,&quot; with the case of ateacher whose service has been declared to  be unsatisfactory and continuesto&apos;be so regarded,  provided always  that no  teacher shall be penalised inrespect of years of satisfactory service.                            GENERAL CONDITIONS.Condition of Increments.    io. No increment  shall be  withheld in  respect of any year unless the  service for that year has been declared unsatisfactory by the Local Education authority or Education Committee, but the effect of this shall be limited to one year unless theLocal Education Authority or the Education Committee otherwise determine.    II. Any bonus paid during the financial year in which a Standard Scale comes into force shall be deemed a payment under the Standard Scale.Date of Application.    12. A Standard Scale adopted for any area shall come into operation on a date to be stated in the Provisional Agreement  mentioned in Section 16 below, subjectto the confirmation mentioned in Section 17 below, and any increments falling due on or after that date shall in amount be as provided under the Standard Scale.Date of Increments.                                                         &apos;    13. Each Authority may follow its  present procedure as regards the date of payment of annual increments.Payments in excess of the Scale.    14. Nothing in the Standard Scales shall be held to limit the discretion of theAuthority to make additional payments (a) for a period of College  Training lessthan two years,  (b)  for special qualifications, (c) to Women Teachers  holding postsof special responsibility in large mixed Schools, or (d)  for similar reasons.               EFFECT UPON THE PROVISIONAL MINIMUM SCALE.            *    15. Nothing in the Standard Scales or in the conditions attaching to them shallaffect the provisions of the Report of 21st November, 1919, upon  the ProvisionalMinimum Scale, including the arrangements set out in Section 15 of that Report.        ALLOCATION OF  THE STANDARD  SCALES TO THE SEVERAL AREAS.    16. Every Local Education Authority is invited by the Committee to confer with the Teachers in its  area with a view to a Provisional Agreement as to whichStandard Scale is appropriate to the area, and on such Provisional Agreement being reached: to notify the  Standing Joint Committee accordingly.   Such notificationshould be given within four months from the date of the issue of this Report.    17. The Committee shall consider every such Provisional Agreement and confirmit or Otherwise,  and for  that purpose they may have  before them representations from the Local Education Authority and the Teachers, and  they shall not come toany decision contrary  to an  Agreement  without having asked for and consideredsuch representations.    18. Within  six months  from the date of issue of this  Report the committee shall settle and  publish a Schedule showing the Standard Scale which is,  in  their
opinion, appropriate; to each Local Education Authority, due regard, being had toAgreements arrived at under Sections 16 and 17 of this Report.                               EXISTING SCALES.    19. No Scale in operation on the date of the issue of this Report shall be reducedby reason of anything contained in this Report.                              CHANGE OF SCALES.         &apos;i    20. Any Local Education  Authority may, at any time, in agreement with itsTeachers, and with the consent of the Standing Joint Committee, proceed from oneStandard Scale to another, provided nevertheless that no Local Education Authorityoutside the &quot; London Area &quot; as defined in Section 25  below, shall adopt  Scale IV.unless such adoption is confirmed by the Standing Joint Committee.&apos;    21. The Standing Joint Committee, and each Panel of it (i,e., the representativesof the  County Councils Association, the Municipal Corporations Association, theAssociation of Education Committees  and  the London  County Council, and therepresentatives of the National Union of  Teachers  respectively), shall exert their best influence to  prevent the adoption or change of a Scale by any Local EducationAuthority contrary to the opinion or decision of the Committee, and the committee may, if necessary, make representations to the Board of Education concerning  suchaction by any Local Education Authority.     22.  If  after  ist April,  1921, the datum figure of the cost of living as certified by the Board of  Trade reaches 170 per  cent,  over pre-war costs and remains not lessthan that for a period of 6 months subsequent to the afore-mentioned date, it  shallbe open  to the  Chairman of the Standing Joint Committee on the application of either Panel to call the Committee together for the purpose of adjusting the Standard Scales of Salaries to meet such abnormal economic conditions for such time as the abnormality has existed or may continue to  exist,  but any payment under  such adjustment shall not be made before ist April, 1922.     23. Any disagreement between  a  Local Education  Authority and its Teachers on the subject of the adoption, change or interpretation of a Salary Scale shall be referred to the decision of the Standing Joint Committee at the instance either of the Authority or of the Executive  of the National Union of Teachers.                    MINIMUM  DURATION  OF STANDARD  SCALES.      24.  The provisions of Section 15,of the Committee^ Report of the 21st November, 1919,  as to the  abstention  from  pressure by Teachers upon Local  Education Authorities shall be extended until the ist April, 1925, in the case of.  Authorities which adopt Standard Scales  appropriate to their respective areas to take effect as and from  a  date not later than ist  April, 1921;  except that the arrangements already  made with the concurrence of the  Standing Joint Committee between the London  County Council and  the Teachers in their area shall, as agreed, hold good for three years  as from  the ist April, 1920, and that,  if a new scale of salaries be agreed between  the Authorities in  the&quot; London Area,&quot; as defined below, and their Teachers,  to operate on or after ist April, 1923, it shall be subject to  ratification by the  Committee  and shall,hold good until ist  April, 1925;  provided that a decision of a majority of representatives of the areas constituting the &quot;London Area,&quot; appointed on  a  basis, and  following a procedure tobe determined by the Standing Joint  Committee, shall.be deemed to be the decision for all&apos;such areas.      25.  The  &quot;London  Area&quot; shall  &quot;be  the areas, wholly  or partly  within the Metropolitan  Police District,  of such Local Education Authorities as shall arrive at a Provisional Agreement (as defined in  Section 16  of  this  Report)  with  their Teachers that Standard Scale IV.  is  the  appropriate Scale for the whole  of their respective areas;  provided that if the Local Education Authority and the Teachers of any area fail to reach such an agreement within a period of six months from the date of issue of  this Report, the Committee shall settle and publish the  Scale which in their opinion is appropriate to the Local Education Authority concerned.
    26. We  have unanimously  agreed  upon this  Report and  accordingly nowpresent it for adoption by all concerned.                                      We have the honour to be,                                                  Sir,                                              Your obedient Servants,BURNHAM (Chairman).W. D. BENTLIFFA. F. CHUBBE. R.

J  H ^?OXM.L/&quot; J0^ ^on-  Secretaries.30th September,  1920.LETTER ADDRESSED TO LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES BY THEIR   REPRESENTATIVES  UPON  THE STANDING  JOINT COMMITTEE.DEAR SIR,                                                  October, 1920.      HEREWITH we  send you  a copy of  the  Report of the Standing  JointCommittee on  Standard  Scales  of  Salaries  for Teachers in Public elementary schools.  On behalf  of the  representatives of the Local Education authorities on the Committee we desire to draw your attention to the following considerations which influenced them in joining in the preparation ,and issue of this Report.    The  task remitted to  the   Committee  by the  President of  the Board ofEducation  was  to secure  &quot; the  orderly and  progressive  solution  of the salaryproblem &quot; by agreement, on  a national basis.    The issue of the Report dated 21st November, 1919, recommending a ProvisionalMinimum Scale  was only the first step towards the fulfilment of our task.    Your representatives are glad to learn that every Local  Education  authority in England and Wales whose Scale was previously below the Provisional MinimumScale has now raised its Scale to at least the level of that Scale.    The  Panel  representing your interests on the Committee is,  however,  con-vinced  that so  many Authorities  have set up varying  Scales above the ProvisionalMinimum Scale, and so many others are negotiating new Scales, all tending to foster the  spirit of competition  between Local Education Authorities, that a series of standard Scales is imperatively  necessary,  and this Report is  the  result  of their negotiations to that end with the Teachers&apos;  representatives.    Your representatives, recognising the altered economic conditions  now prevailingas compared with  those existing in the Autumn of 1919 when the ProvisionalMinimum  Scale  Report was  prepared, have agreed to join  in preparing by the
ist  January, 1921, a Standard Scale I. to take  effect  from a date not later than  April,  1921.    They  therefore strongly urge Local Education Authorities to  adopt, in agree-ment  with their Teachers,  such  one of the  Standard Scales  as is appropriate totheir respective areas, to take effect from  a date not later than the ist April, 1921.    Nothing  in the present Report alters the  protection  given  to EducationAuthorities which have adopted  the  Provisional Minimum Scale or a better Scale,but the adoption of an appropriate Standard Scale, to take effect  as and from theist  April,  1921, will  extend the  &quot; period  of  peace&apos;,&apos;  previously  secured  untilist  April,  1925.    Your  representatives on the Standing Joint Committee commend this Reporton Standard Scales to your favourable consideration, and will be glad to give anysuch further assistance or advice  as may be desired.                             Yours faithfully,                                    GEORGE LUNN  (Chairman).                                    FRANK J.  LESLIE  (Hon.  Secretary).                                        (Local Education Authorities&apos; Panel of                                           the Standing Joint  Committee).LETTER ADDRESSED BY  THE  CHAIRMAN OF  THE STANDING  JOINT  COMMITTEE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION.                                              13, Bryanston Square, W.,DEAR Mr. FISHER,                                        13th October,  1920.      IN  November last  I was able to inform  you  that  the Standing  JointCommittee representing  Associations of  Local Education  Authorities and theNational Union of Teachers, which was constituted at your instance and met  inSeptember last year &quot; to secure  the orderly  and progressive solution of the salaryproblem  in public elementary schools, by agreement,  on a national basis,&quot; had completed the first  stage of their work by agreeing upon a Provisional MinimumScale of Salaries for Teachers in Public Elementary Schools.    The Report which they then &quot; presented for adoption by  all concerned &quot; met with general  acceptance among those Local Education  Authorities whose  scales of  salary had not yet been adjusted to the conditions of the time.  I am informedthat at  this moment there is no Authority in whose area the rates of pay are notat  least equivalent  to those recommended by the Standing Joint Committee as a&quot; provisional  minimum.&quot;    The Report  resulted, I am sure, in  much benefit to the  public service  ofeducation, not only  in improving the  position of existing teachers and the prospectsoffered to candidates for the profession, but also because  it marked the first approachtowards a common  basis for the treatment  of the salary problem.  It also led  tothe attainment of  some degree of regularity  in  conditions of service in a largenumber of areas the differences of  which in this respect were embarrasing andvexatious and stood in the way of the consolidation of the profession.    In  February of this year the Committee  considered whether they ought notat  once to  carry  their work  a  stage  further  by furnishing Local EducationAuthorities with  guidance in the construction and application of Standard  scales of salary, which might,  even if finality were unattainable, secure a  fair settlement for a substantial  period of peace.    In some  areas scales of salary considerably  above the &quot; provisional minimum &quot;had been adopted  by agreement between the  Authorities  and their  Teachers,  or were  contemplated.  In other  areas it  was  recognised that  scales above  theminimum were justifiable and appropriate, but no accepted standards, other thanstandards mainly competitive,  were  available by reference to which negotiations might be conducted, and the parties appeared to be  embarrased by uncertainty and the fear that they might accept less or concede more than a  further review by the Committee of the material circumstances from the general standpoint  would justify.   It was indeed, in my  own  opinion, most  undesirable that the  &quot; orderly and progressive  solution&quot;  of  the salary problem should be prejudiced by themultiplication of  haphazard local settlements.     The  application of a  single Standard Scale to  all areas, whatever  theirgeographical  position, urban or rural character and local economic conditions, wasconsidered impracticable.  The Committee accordingly  addressed themselves  to thet x 12536B
task of formulating Standard Scales,  a task of great inherent difficulty, which was certainly not lessened by the necessity of dealing expeditiously with a very difficult situation which had arisen in London.     After  thirteen meetings of the full  Committee  (since  the  adoption  of theFirst Report) and numerous meetings of Sub-Committees, the Report which I now submit to you was unanimously adopted.  Owing to the nature of the  subject matter it is necessarily more complex than the First Report.  If, as I sincerelyhope will be the case,  the  Report is generally accepted by the Teachers and theAuthorities, it still leaves to the Standing Joint Committee a considerable  part toplay in the process  of giving  effect to the  Report  and  a  considerable share Ofresponsibility  for its accomplishment.  I  do not myself regard  this as a defect. I am sure that no Committee, unless it together&apos; with its constituents were endowed with supernatural wisdom, could have devised a report on  such  a subject which would leave it nothing more to do nor any &quot; loose ends &quot; to  be gathered up in the process of  dealing with concrete individual  cases.  And,  indeed, I am so  much impressed by  the industry, fairness, and public spirit of  the Committee  and its capacity for practicaj affairs, that it would in  my opinion be unfortunate if it did not remain intimately concerned with the  application of  the  recommendations which it has made.     There is,  I think,  general agreement that it has already succeeded in creating in the country at large a much clearer atmosphere  and  better temper, and has largely neutralised,  in the province  of public education, tendencies which  at one time threatened not only to impair the efficiency of that service but to weaken its stabilising influence in the critical period of  national reconstruction.  But  on the men  and women  who form, the Committee  itself  the constant interchange  of divergent . or  conflicting  views and  their  reconciliation  have  naturally  had  a consolidating  effect far greater than can  be reflected in the constituencies  which they  represent;  I  have watched the development  of the Committee  with great interest and some knowledge of the character and methods of  similar  bodies.  It was ;a good body to start with, but it is  a much  better body now, and I venture to think that.it has grown up into  an  organisation on whose public  spirit and statesmanlike quality you can confidently rely and which is  both willing and com- petent to help you in that development of the public  system of education to which you have set  your hand and for which you are responsible. &apos;      I am sure the members of the  National Union of Teachers will not misunder- stand me if I  refer particularly to the self-sacrificing and ungrudging spirit in which the representatives of the  Local Education  Authorities have devoted themselves to the arduous work  of the Committee.   These busy people,  already carrying a heavy burden of responsible public work, have come to  London time after time,  many from long distances, determined to &quot; put  the business through.&quot;  If ever  a body  of representatives has laboured unremittingly and exhaustingly in the  discharge of its commission it is the Local Authorities&apos; Panel of the Joint Committee.  I am afraid that if similar Panels  are to be formed for  the consideration  of the  salary problem in branches of education not yet touched, they will have to include  a good deal of fresh blood, as some members of the present Panel cannot fairly be  asked to do more.  As for the representatives of the  Teachers, I will only say that  whilst both in qualities of character and in ability they have worthily maintained  the  credit  of their profession, they  have shown themselves  excellent men and  women of business.      To Sir G. Lunn as Chairman and spokesman of the Authorities&apos; Panel, and  to Sir J. Yoxall who doubled the parts of spokesman  and Secretary of the Teachers&apos;  Panel, much  of the credit  of the  Cortimittee&apos;s work is  due.   Their  qualities  of  leadership and good humour and experience as men of affairs have been invaluable.  Mr. Leslie, as Secretary of the Authorities&apos;  Panel and as their  spokesman  on the  Reference  Committee, has  had: both  hands  full.  He has personally conducted a  large, mass of correspondence and  has thereby &quot; kept1 the decks clear &quot;  for the  Committee and enabled it to. concentrate on  its main business./     I enclose herewith a copy of a letter which  the Local Authorities&apos; Panel  are&apos;. addressing to their constituents,1 and I hope you will see your way to give early  publicity to the. Report in such manner as you may think  most convenient.                                                      I am,                                                         Yours sincerely,  THE  RT.

  LETTER FROM  THE PRESIDENT OF THE  BOARD  OF  EDUCATION     TO  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE STANDING JOINT COMMITTEE.                                              Board of Education,                                                     Whitehall, S.W.I,DEAR LORD BURNHAM,                                     i$th October, 1920.      I HAVE received your  letter of  the 13th October, enclosing  the Report of theStanding Joint Committee upon Standard Scales of Salaries for Teachers in public elementary Schools.  I  understand that  the immediate publication of the report is desired, and in order that it may  not be delayed I will not now attempt such a considered reply as the importance of the matter requires.    It would, however,  be  ungracious  if I did not at once express  my cordialrecognition of the spirit in which the Committee has worked.  What you say of itwill be most gratifying to all the friends of Education.  I both know and appreciatewhat  real sacrifices  of time and, I am afraid, sometimes of health their work hasentailed upon the  members and  on  their spokesmen and Secretaries.   I  am verygrateful to them.   To  yourself, as  Chairman,  I desire to  express my  warmestthanks for your services.   There are  many demands  on your time and energy.You spend them generously on  public work.  In the  present  case I  learn from many quarters how much your good judgment,  tact, and patience,  together with your sincere interest in  the subject  matter, have furthered the  work of the JointCommittee.   I am sure your time has not been  wasted in endeavouring to  promote the welfare of one of the most  important branches of the public service.                                              Yours sincerely,                                                       H. A. L. FISHER.  THE RT. HON.
