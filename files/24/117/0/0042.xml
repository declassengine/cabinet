During the two months which have elapsed since thePrime Minister, on October 18th, Informed the House of commons of the first results of the deliberations of the Cabinet andthe Cabinet Unemployment commIttee, the progress which has beenmade is, in my opinion, quite inadequate to the growing needs ofthe situation.   A practically equal period will elapse beforeParliament reassembles in February, and I must place on recordmy view that, unless the rate of progress along our various linecan be very greatly accelerated, we shall be faced with a situa*tion of the greatest difficulty;  particularly as unemploymentitself is almost certain to increaseo     As to new Arterial Road Works *   The position is that some4,500 men are employed on schemes of this character.  progress with the London Scheme is really deplorably slow,(2)  As regards goad Maintenance and Repair work:-I am very much in the dark as to what progress has been, or isbeing made, because no figures are  available showing the numbersof men employed.  In any case, however, it is probable thatworks of this character will not develop more/rapidly than thenew Arterial Road Schemes, because  whilst the latter are sped-fically aimed at reducing unemployment, the former are regarded by tho Ministry of Transport as primarily conditioned pytraffic needs.  Indeed the Ministry of Transport franklyInsists that it is not a Department for the provision of ReliefPROGRESS OF TUL  I.ASURIS TO DEAL  ITH         uTtt&quot;J.IPLOYivSE;NT.MEMORANDUM BY THE.

Work  ( I am making no complaint - Subject to its generalconception of Its functions the Ministry of Transport hashelped very mucho  But I really should like the positionclarified if possible*)  I should like to raise one furtherpoint in this connection.- Assistance is only given by theMinistry of Transport in respect of roads classified under theScheme.  There are nany other roads on which Local authorities would carry out work if assisted; but tho conditions laid down for the administration of tho new  3,000,000 grant would apparently exclude such assistance under that Scheme, as thegrant is available for &quot;useful work^ other than work on roads and on Housing Schemes&quot;eHastening of &quot;iork on Layout of ^ites &amp; oewera^e &apos;:vorkQ     So far as the expansion of work on the sites, roads, and sewers in connection with Housing Schemes is concerned, thehighest estimate which I have yet seen of the number of additionalmen employed on thi3 work since October 19th is 6,500c     I am extremely anxious that Ir all the branches of work towhich I have referred every possible step snail be taken toensure the ?naxlmum development during the recess.As regards what I will call the Lord StoDavid;s Committee fB.5 millions:-     I attended a meeting of London M.P,fs largely  attended whenthe following Resolution was unanimously adopted:-     &quot;That the London Members consider that the new  3,000,000       Unemployment Scheme is too&apos; onerous to encourage London       Boroughs, in view of the high rates already prevailing, to       undertake work of which only 30$ of the wages for the extr.       labour Is to be paid from the Government Fund; and to ask       them to largely Increase the amount and to modify the terms&quot;.     I must press this view on my colleagues.Provision for flomen.     Strong representations are being made to me, as they wore mad&apos;

The -natter I respectfully suggest, should be consideredby the &apos; cabinet. (6)   The &quot;;uildinc Trades Negotiations.           As  regards the negotiations with the Building  Trades,&quot;  it is clear that rreat  feeling  exists  on the  proposal  of  the  5 Train- ing  Grant,  &apos;-&apos;hich has been commonly  described as  &quot;a  bribe&quot;.   In view of  what  has been said in  various quarters,  it  seems very probabl that the trades, to  save their own  self-respect, will break off negotiations.   In order  that we may be prepared  for such a contin- gency, I most earnestly  ask the Cabinet to  consider whether, if such a  situation develops,  I  may be empowered to  offer  .0 the Building Trades the  first alternative presented in the  Second Interim Report of the Cabinet  Committee on Unemployment, namely   &quot;(1)  (a) For  the  purpose of  protecting their funds the Building       .  Trade skilled  Onions above-mentioned are entitled to corn-         pens at ion to the extent to  i-hich, as a result of the intro-         duction  of ex-Servioe  men,  the average rate of unemployment *         for any  of the ten years be,; inning 1st January, ISjI, Is in         excess  of the  &quot;standard rate&quot; in each  section of the building         industry to  which the  offer  applies:         (b) That this  offer of  compensation  shall be confined to         the bricklayers,  plasterers,  slaters and tilers? that the         maximum  payment  should be 10/- per week&quot; over and above the         15/-  a week  drawn under the  Cmemployment Insurance Act, and         should be  paid only in respect of those members of the Trade         Unions who are in receipt ct benefit under the Insurance Act         and who  claim  it tbrocgn the Trade Unions:-         (c)   The &quot;standard rate of  unemployment&quot; should be arrived        nt  by taking  one-half  of the average gross rates of uremploy-         ment  of  the  Unions concerned for the five years 1909-1913.*         The resulting  standard rates are:-         &quot; for Bricklayers, one-ha If  of 15/. - 6-J$            &quot;  Plasterers,   &quot;    &quot;    &quot; 19% - 9^f;            &quot;  Slaters  and              Tilers,        &quot;    &quot;    &quot; 15% - 7tf                   .         I would  remind my colleagues that on two alternative assump-         tions as to  the  total  unemployment rated Sir Alfred Watson         estimates  that the total cost of the Scheme for any year,         under the  above  conditions, *.ill be as follows:-
     On tho question of cost,  I  think that  the  Chancellorof the Exchequer will find on a  careful consider at on of  theprobabilities that this scheme involves only a  very smallliability to the State if the guarantee Is  limited, as --asproposed, to the ten years beginning the 1st January 1921-  Onthe other hand, tlr; proposal Is, in my opinion,  a very much better one for the Government to take its stand by; and ifthe Unions should refuse *t, our position will  be proportion-ately strengthened.     I should add that if, in oaoe the need arises, 1 amauthorised to approach the Unions on this basis, I should beprepared to negotiate with the Unions as to the number of years which the guarantee should cover, i.e. possibly a shorter period than ten years.                         (Signed)  2.J. MACNAMARA.                                      December  22nd, 1920.
