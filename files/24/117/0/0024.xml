This  document is the property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Govarnment.SECRET.CP. 2324.                              THE  CABINET.THE PALESTINE  GARRISON.    MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.    I circulate a short note on this subject which has been prepared by the Director ofMilitary Operations.  So far as the security of the Empire  is concerned,  we are theweaker, rather than the stronger, by the occupation of Palestine.                                                                     W. S. C.  THE WAR OFFICE,         18th December, 1920.    1. (i.)  The garrison of Palestine is at the present time approximately 9,800 Britishand 19,000 Indian, but of these some 2,800  British troops are temporarily detached to constantinople and Egypt.  The above totals comprise the following units:                3 British Cavalry Regiments.               3 Indian Cavalry  Regiments.               1 Battery R.H.A.               1 Brigade R.F.A.               1 Brigade, Pack Artillery (less 1 Battery).               3 British Infantry Battalions.              11 Indian Infantry Battalions.               1 L.A.A. Company.               1 Battalion Judeans.    (ii.)  The above garrison is now in process of reduction, and it is anticipated that bythe beginning of January it will be reduced  to :                3 British Cavalry Regiments,               3 Indian Cavalry Regiments,               1 Battery R.H.A.,               1 Brigade R.F.A.,               1 Brigade,  Pack Artillery (less 1  Battery),               4 British Infantry Battalions,               1 Indian Infantry Battalion,giving a  total strength of approximately 9,000 British and 6,000 Indian troops. *    (iii.) In  view of the urgent necessity of limiting the number of Indian troopsserving outside India to a minimum, the above 6,000 Indian troops, that is to say, thethree Indian Cavalry Regiments and one Indian Infantry Battalion, with their necessaryancillaries, should be replaced by British units as soon as the latter can be released from elsewhere.     2. The garrison  mentioned in paragraph 1 (ii) will be required  until such time asthe Civil Administration is securely established and has organized and matured its own forces.   The  task which the garrison has at present to carry out is twofold                     (a.) Internal security.                    (6.) Protection from external aggression.     3. Internal security. The country has  not  yet settled down under the present administration.   There are three  elements                             (i.) Arab, i.e., Mohammedan.                           (ii.) Christian.                          (iii.) Jewish.     Riots  are  likely to break out in  large  towns such as Jerusalem, Jaffa,  Haifa,Nablus&apos;&amp;C-                     * See footnote overleaf.     (lW/m)  100 12/20 H&amp;S, Iitd.  8810wo
     There is strong feeling between the Arabs and Jews,  as tho former  ate under theimpression that their land is to be  forcibly taken away under the British mandate and given to the Jews.    t The  Jewish  settlements are,  therefore,  liable  to be  raided whenever religiousfeeling runs high, or mischief makers succeed  in exciting local feeling.     4.  External aggression. The cavalry form a mobile central reserve and are readyto move anywhere from Dan to  Beersheba at any sudden  call.   In addition  to this,they furnish permanent posts on  the  Kiver Jordan to  stop  Bedouin raids from Trans-Jordania.     On the northern boundary,  Palestine  is liable to  external  raiding by Circassiansand brigands who inhabit the southern extremity of the Lebanon range.     On the east, in Hauran, Ajlun and the Belqa live  troublesome Arab tribes.  Chiefamongst these are the Beni Hasan and Beni Sakr, both exceeding 3,000 fighting  men.     These  tribes habitually raid  the Palestinian Valleys, crossing the Jordan  betweenLake Tiberias and the Dead Sea.     On the south-east there is a flank open to the desert and it  is  necessary  to keepposts and Camel Corps in the vicinity  of Beersheba.  In  addition to protecting theinhabitants, the security of the desert railway from Kantara has to be considered.    * Note to paragraph f (ii). The  garrison shown in paragraph  1  (ii) will not actually be located inPalestine until later in the spring, owing to the undesirability of moving  units between Egypt and Palestineduring the winter.  Hence certain units of the Palestine garrison will be found temporarily in Egypt, and vice versa, until the summer distribution is carried out.    In the meanwhile some of the eight Indian battalions which are temporarily retained  in the EgyptExpeditionary Force, at Lord Allenby&apos;s request, are accommodated in Palestine in place of certain british battalions.
