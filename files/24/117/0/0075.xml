CABINET.C.P.-237S.                            uMPLOmBNT.4Statement to ba mado to industrial Council.(For consideration &quot;by the Cabinet on morning of Thuraday,                      Pec ember 30th, 1920.     For some time paet the Government have had und&amp;rearnest consideration the problem of unemployment.1.   The general question nsed not b$ now considered except     in so far as it affects the Royal Dockyards and. Naval     festablisbments.2.   it the last meeting of tht Industrial Council it was     mentioned that on December 9th the Chancellor of the     Bseheguor delivered a speech In which he foreshadowed     a system of short-time In order to avoid an increase of     dischargee and thereby an increase of unemployment.     Theraethod of carrying out this idea has nm been     further considered by the Government amd they have     definitely decided that short-*time shall,forthwith cerae     into operation in Admiralty and War Office establish-3.   The proposal is that the working hours cf th* Dockyards     m&amp; Admiralty Industrial Establishments be reduced by 10    , per week.  Tho difference between the present full-time     wages and the future short-time wages will be utilised     for the employment of more men than would otherwise be     the ease.  Further discharged or reduction in the     Dockyards&apos; will be suspended and work will be found for     many of those at present cnemployad.    provision of employment will be effected ia %mways.  Firstly, as many men as possible will be absorbed- Qf course, also on short-time -  on the work in handIn the yards In order to make up for the work lost mthe lessened weekly working hours.   It is impossible t$employ sufficient men to make up fully for the time lost by the shortened hours, partly because of the difficultyof finding the proportion of skilled men to balance the unskilled, and partly because it is Impossible t$employ an in&amp;ojftaftie number of men on a particular job;but so far as it is possible to employ more men te make up for the lost timet this will be done.  There are anmnbar of jobs in the lards such as cleaning and paintingbilgest scraping and painting ships newly delivered,preservation of weather wark and similar jobs which lathe ordinary course, ewing to financial stringency,
would not be carried ont, but could be done with odrantage,and it, is proposed to put as many men on to this and similar work as quickly as possible.  It is proposed to start re-absorbing the unemployed ss soon as the short-time hours come into force; and the money thereby savedbecomes available *5. l&apos;no proposed now system of hours is as follows   Work to begin at 8 a.m. daily instead of at V a.m.,   and no work to be done an Saturdays,  This will effect a   reduction on the weekly total of hours of 10 hours &amp;   week.  Thus it will be seen that tho effect will be  not   to reduce the amount of money at present spont on wages   but to spread that sum out to the fullest possible extent   in providing employment for as many people as possible.6. The Cabinet relies upon the cordial co-operation of  all   classes of workmen in the Royal Dockyards in assisting   the nation to tide over the distressing period of   unemployment, by helping to absorb man out of work.   Under this system of sacrificing part of thei? time  the   men will play a large part in solving the problem   which is wido-spread throughout the Country,,        .!Dhis scheme shall not prejudice the pensions of   Established men.Ministry of Labour,  December 29th, 1920.
