Your communication of the 15th instant,  relative to the employment of ex-servicemen in the Building Trade, other than ex-service men who have had previous trainingin the  building industry (the latter number  which we  say equals 40 per cent, of thepresent personnel), was laid before a full Conference of the Joint Executive Councils ofthe societies affiliated  to the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives, andwas  fully  considered,  when it  was  carried  by a  unanimous   resolution  that theConference  does not  consider  any  useful purpose would be served by sending adeputation to your proposed  Conference, to be held at  Montagu House, on  Monday next the 20th instant, at 3 o&apos;clock in the afternoon, due to the fact that the deputationnot having executive power could only act in a consultative capacity.    The Ministry will readily appreciate that even were the matter discussed it wouldhave to be referred to the full Joint Executives for  consideration.  Therefore, in order   (B 16776)  5M 12/20 &apos;H &amp; S Ltd.
to avoid  delay,  the Conference  requests  the  Government  to  communicate whatproposals it has for dealing with this problem ; upon receipt of same we undertake to summon a Special Conference of Joint Executive Councils affiliated, to  consider such proposals, and our reply will be duly commuuicated.

(3)  Letter from Minister  of  Labour to National Federation of  Building                               Trade Operatives.                                     MINISTRY OF LABOUR,                                             MONTAGU HOUSE,  WHITEHALL,                                                    LONDON, S.W. 1,                                                           18th December, 1920. DEAR MR.  HICKS,     I have received your request of December 17th that the proposals of the Govern- ment should be  communicated in writing rather than at a Conference as I proposed to you on December 15th.  I therefore send you the proposals of the Government..     (1) The arrears  in  suitable housing accommodation due in part to the reduction in building  before the war, and gravely aggravated by the  total cessation of building during  the  war constitutes a serious  hardship, particularly upon the working classes themselves.  The situation is accentuated by the fact that the number of skilled men in the Building Trades is very considerably less than before the war, so that, not only is the number less than would be needed  to meet the normal building requirements of the country, but it is wholly inadequate to overtake the very large volume of arrears with. which the country is confronted.  Side by side with  these  undoubted facts, there are tens of thousands of  young ex-service  men, to whom the country rests under the  most profound obligation, ready and willing to engage upon  productive work, asking work and not  charity, and finding themselves without the  opportunity of earning that decent subsistence  to which their services to the country  in  the hour of its  necessity so abundantly entitle them.     (2)  The Government is of opinion, therefore, that the absorption into the industry of a  large  body  of ex-service men  as adult apprentices or trainees with a  view to becoming skilled craftsmen, should be  commenced  forthwith.   The numbers to  be absorbed should be on the basis of one  in  five, calculated on the number of skilled  men in the whole industry, but the proportion must vary in different trades.   The highest percentages should be applied to the three branches of the industry where  the need is greatest, namely, bricklayers,  slaters  and  tilers,  and plasterers,  and the  minimum number  of men thus admitted to the skilled crafts for housing purposes shall be not less than 50,000.  The proportions to  be  admitted in  the various crafts above specified will be arranged with the Minister of Labour.     (3)  In  return for an undertaking to admit and  train these ex-service  men, the Government  is prepared to make a Training Grant of  5 per head to the Unions for each man admitted  to the Trade Unions concerned and trained in any of the  trades in the Building Industry.  This grant will be paid as follows :                     2 on admission to training.                    3 at the completion  of the training.    Men appointed as  Instructors of the new entrants will be rated and paid asLeading Hands.
Printed under the Authority of His MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY OITICK,  By Harrison and Sons, Ltd., 44-47, St,. Martiu&apos;s Lane, W.C. 2.   r (4)  The Government accept the principle of  a guaranteed  rate of pay on  housing operations for time lost  owing to wet and  inclement weather, subject to the Trade Unions accepting the augmentation set out in paragraph 2, and are prepared to provide for the application on housing schemes of this principle on the following basis, viz,-:      &quot; In the case  of a man employed, or standing by to work  on  a job when called         upon, for  a full week, the payment for time lost through  stress of  weather         shall be 50 per cent, in respect of time lost up to 22 hours per week.     &quot;In the case  of time lost in excess of 22 hours, the hours lost  over and above         22 hours shall be paid for at the rate of 75 per cent, of the time rate.&quot;     (5)  The Government appreciate the anxiety with which Building Trade Operatives view the prospect of considerable additions to the  membership  of  their craft.  In the years immediately before the war, and mainly in  consequence of  the  reduction in the number of houses built as described in the first  paragraph, the Building  Trades were subject to frequent and grave periods of unemployment, with  all the hardships entailed to the families of  the workers.  Having regard, however,  to the  great  arrears  of building work throughout the country arrears which must be made good at the earliest possible  opportunity and to the admitted  shortage  in  the number of skilled men in the  building trades as compared with pre-war  days, the Government are of opinion that  no  risk  of unemployment  is involved  in  their  proposals.   If,  however,  their confidence is not shared by the Unions, it is within the power of the industry as a whole to provide against this contingency.   An amended Unemployment Insurance Act has been  placed  upon the  Statute  Book this year.   That Act  provides a benefit of 15s. a week which, if the  Trade  Union cares  to  become the Agency for  administration, becomes  at least 20$. a week by an additional contribution of at  least 5s. a week from Trade Union Funds.     The Training Grants  mentioned in paragraph 3 above, would provide a substantial foundation for any addition which the Unions may desire to make to the provision under the Insurance Act.     (6) I shall be glad if you will place this communication before your Executive, and in view of the pressing urgency of the matter, the Government desires me to  ask  for a reply by the end of the year.                                       Yery faithfully yours,                                             (Signed)  T. J. MACNAMARA.G. Hicks, Esq.,     President, National Federation of         Building Trade Operatives,             20A, Cedars Road,                 Clapham.
