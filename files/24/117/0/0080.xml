j.p.  23 80   V)     Hla Dr.unit;j f-^a^^^    &apos;&apos;  I ICSJRC^TED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.         SECRET.              The War Office proposal with regard to Mesopotamia is to persist in  a  coneen-         tration in the Basra vilayet.   They hope to gain by this a saving of 5,000,000Z. in the         next financial  year, that is all.   This is  based on a view, which I cannot share, that         the concentration can be effected peacefully.   I would base myself entirely upon the         Prime Minister^ own answer to this proposal.              I quote from Hansard of the 23rd June 1920 from a speech made  on  the Army         Estimates  by the  Prime  Minister  in answer  to Mr. Asquith.   I quote the whole         passage, it is all so convincing, but I have ventured to italicize two or three sentences         which appear  to be conclusive.   I believe the Prime Minister was  right  then and         Mr. Asquith wrong.  I hope the Cabinet  will  think twice before admitting belatedly         that Mr. Asquith was right.                         ^ylS-j ^0              THE PRIME MINISTER: The Right Hon. Gentleman suggests that we  should  leave         Baghdad and come right down to the marshes of Basra, on the ground that we could         not afford to remain in Baghdad : but that if the League of Nations asked us, then we         were to go back at once, whether  we could afford  it or not, because the League  of         Nations asked us.   Let  me follow that process.  It is very interesting.  We should         have cleared out.   Who  or what would have taken our place ?  Chaos, in some  form         or other.   There was no government.  We had destroyed the  Turkish government.         You might have had some Arab  chief,  but  then  another Arab chief would  have         contested his claim.   You would  have had civil war, and probably Mustapha Kemal         would have come down and occupied the country.  The League of  Nations under  these         conditions would have said, &quot; We  make you mandatory.&quot;  And we should have gone         back  to reconquer the  country.   We  should have had  to  organise another  great         expeditionary force, because we should have had to clo it thoroughly.  We  could not         have taken chances of another Kut, and the capture of British forces.  It would have         had to be done carefully and thoroughly and with overwhelming forces.   Twenty-FIVE         millions !  The cost of reconquering the whole country from Basra up to Mosul would         have  been much nearer 150,000,0001 or 200,000,0001  What a policy ! I could         understand anyone getting up and saying, &quot; Do  not touch the country.   It is none  of         &quot; your business.  Leave it alone.   The moment you had defeated the Turks you ought         &quot; to have cleared out.&quot;  That is a clear policy.  But to say that you should  only clear         out to Basra  and  stick  there, and then, when the League  of  Nations  asks you  to         advance, you should organise  another military expedition to re-conquer the country,         is about as preposterous a suggestion as could be made.              My Right Hon. Friend would  take responsibility for the vilayet of Basra.   He         might even go a little further.  He  was  not quite clear as to the boundary.  But  at         the beginning of his speech he said, &quot; You really cannot stop between the Black Sea         and the Persian  Gulf.&quot;  But is  not Basra between  the  Black  Sea and the Persian         Gulf?   Is not Nasariah between the Black Sea and the Persian Gulf ?             Whether you go to  Basra, or  Nasariah, or Mosul, you are up against  the  same         problem : you must have a boundary or  a frontier somewhere.  The point is, where         are you going to fix that frontier?   My Right Hon. Friend seems to forget that he is         responsible for the Sykes-Picot Agreement.   Under  the  Sykes-Picot Agreement the         British were to become responsible for the whole vilayet of Baghdad as well as Basra.         That was the policy at that time.   In view of  the criticisms about the  selfishness of         our views about oil and grain, may I point out that under that agreement we claimed         that Great  Britain  should have priority  of right  to  enterprise  and local  loans, not         merely  in that area, but in the whole of that sphere of influence ?  That was the         purpose of the authors of that agreement.             I  am  answering  my  Right Hon.  Friend.  That was  his view at  that  time.         His view at that time was that we should  accept  responsibility for the  whole  of         Mesopotamia,  but  now  lie  retires  to Basra,   What  possible defence can there  be         for that?   Clear out altogether is  an intelligible policy, but not to take this marshy         end of Mesopotamia, garrison it, administer it, with  no definite boundary, and  divide         the population.   Would you clo it with the  consent or without the consent of the Arabs ?         If the i\arabs said, &quot; We want  a  unit of Mosul,  Baghdad,  and Basra,&quot; are we to say         &quot; No, this part is to be ours &quot; ?I                                    &apos;_
