I am directed to forward herewith the  following report on the work of the ministry of Health during  october and November,                                Yours faithfully,                                     /          (I//&apos;.   fi.  A/fa/  Secretary.The Secretary,   The Cabinet.                   I.   HOUSING..    1*   Local Housing Bonds.   The  total  amount  raised by  localbonds for housing purposes has now  reached over  13I millionpounds.                                 Bonds         The London County Council/&apos;have realised over 3 millionpounds,  Bradford has raised over a million and Bolton over 600,000.    2.   Progress of the Grant to Private Builders.  A largenumber of houses built by private builders, under the terms  ofthe Government grant,  are now reaching the stage of completion.During the month ended the 26th November, 1,120 houses werefinished and. the builders received grants amounting to  263,775.         The total payments up to the 26th November amounted to 871,178 in respect of 3,883 houses, and  up to the  same date,Certificates &quot;A&quot; had been granted in respect of 25,978 houses.    3 *  &apos; Co &quot;Operative and Communal Arrangements in connectionwitli  State-aided Housing Schemes.  A sub-commit tee  of the                                                    Housing/
Housing Schemes Council has been appointed to consider andreport as to the extent (if any) to which it is practicable and desirable to provide for communal and co-operative arrange-ments in connection with State-aided housing schemes, and as tothe seeps necessary xor bringing such arrangements intooperation.    4.   Housing Schemes undertaken by H.M.Office of Works *It has been decided that H.&amp;.Office of Tories should build for34 local authorities and in 12 cases instructions have beengiven for work to proceed.   In a number of the remaining cases9the negotiations are so far advanced that it is anticipated that authority to start work can be given very shortly.   The numberof houses and flats included in the 34 schemes is 9,149 and work has been commenced on 946 houses.         The question of utilising the services of the offices of Works is under consideration in 13 other cases.    5.   Special.methods of Construction.  On the 3rd Decemberproposals for the erection of 36,651 houses by special methodsof construction were under consideration.   Of these, contracts for 18,929 houses have been placed and contracts for a further2,615 houses are being arranged.   5,314 houses were in courseof erection.         In addition to the above, Certificates &quot;A&quot; have beenissued by local authorities in respect of 4,170 houses, makingthe total number of special construction houses in course oferection 9,484.         A  special effort is now being made to persuade localauthorities to adopt more freely special methods of construc-t\pn with a view to the more speedy erection of houses, and itis anticipated that this special effort will result in contractsbeing placed shortly for the construction of a considerablenumber of houses by methods other than the use of brick andstone.
    6*   Acquisition of Sites by Agreement.  The latest figuresavailable show that in 4,983 cases negotiations for theacquisition of sites for housing purposes have been success-fully completed.   The total area of these amounts to  21,622acres, and the prices asked by owners or provisionally agreed with    the local authorities amounted to  5,622,041 or anaverage of  260 per acre...  The amount agreed by the Valuersof the Inland Revenue Department was  4,080,757 or an averageof  188 per acre thus showing a saving of  1,541,283 or 27,5per cent.   Up to the end of October, 1920, the latest date for which figures are available, 15,458 sites of a total areaof 88,602 acres had been valued by Valuers of the InlandRevenue Department...    7*   Housing Schemes.,  During the four weeks ending the27th November, 193 sites were submitted by local authoritiesand Public Utility Societies.   The total number of sites whichhad been submitted up to the 27th November, was 11,361 (allowing for deductions due to sites which have been withdrawn or hadto be rejected as unsuitable or for other reasons).         The total area comprised in these sites was approximate&apos;ly 74,000 acres, which would provide for 740,000 houses.   the sites actually approved numbered 8,597 covering over 56,000acres.   The total number of applications up to the  27thNovember for approval of lay-outs was 6,765, of which theMinistry had approved&apos; 6,178.   Up to the same date,  plans for277,630 houses had been submitted and of those the ministry had given approval for 261,368.   Tenders had been submitted for 175,670 houses and of this number the Ministry had approved161,909.    s*   Houses in course of erection.  On the 4th December,130,867 houses were included in signed contracts, and on the1st November, the latest date for which figures are  available,                                                         46,471/
46,471 house8 were under construction of which 5,893 were completed, and, in addition 2,854 were finished with theexception of painting.    9&apos;   ,Bu.ildlng;.by.^ D i r ect Labour.  108 local authoritiesare now proceeding with building schemes on,which they areemploying direct labour.   These schemes involve the building of 8,000&quot;houses. * Twelve Public Utility Societies are alsobuilding by direct labour on schemes which comprise 1,075houses.   10.   Supply of Tiles and Slates.  It has been decided thatthe Director Of Building idaterlals Supplies should no longerundertake to supply slates and tiles in connection with housingschemes and following upon a conference with representativesof the Scottish Office It has.been decided  that he should no     under..   .longer &quot;/take the supply of materials in Scotland.   11. &apos;; negotiations &quot;with :the::.-gliding. Trade.  It will beremembered that in September the Cabinet Housing Committeehad, in order  to secure progress, decided reluctantly toaccept the scheme of the Building Kesettlement Committee forthe augiiientation oi skilled labour in the building trade.The&apos;main &quot;&quot;proposal of the scheme was that apprenticeship  in  theseveral trades should be resumed and that a system of adult,apprenticeship, which would, permit of the reinforcement  ofthe trade by ex-servlec/iaen up. to the age oi 26,  should beadopted.   The ^settlement Committee accepted  the principleof some payment being mads to men. in respect  of  time  lost through stress of weather, but.  considered that  the form  ofthe payment  for wet time  should be agreed upon  between  opera-tives  and employers.   acceptance  of the Building ResettlementCommittee scheme  by  the  Government was,conditional  on theapproval  of  the i*minister  of health  of  the. proposals  for  pay-merit  for, time  lost  through  bad. weather  so  far as  they would affect housing schemes  financially.                                                          The/
          The  scheme  of the  building^.Res^t4Jeinent Committee could not come  into  operation-until it was adopted by the Trades  Unions- -and Employers Association,  and be fore., -submitting the  scheme to these  bodies  the  Committee  endeavoured  to come to  an agreement on the subject  of payment for wet time  Yfhich could be  immediately applied to housing schemes.    The  attemptresulted  in failure.   The  representatives- of the  employerson the Committee --were  willing to  agree  to  payment  in  respectof 50 per  cent  of all  time  lost through bad weather:  the operatives demanded not less than  75 per  cent.           With  a view  to  securing  agreement  the Minister ofHealth called a special meeting of the  Resettlement Committee,but after  prolonged negotiation a  deadlock resulted.   TheMinister then announced that, if the Trades  Unions would accept the proposals of the Resettlement Committee, he wouldbe prepared to  put into force a compromise  proposal withregard to  wet time, under which 50 per  cent  of all time lostwould be paid for up to 22 hours in a week  and 7.5  per cent for hours  lost  in excess  of 22 hours.   It  was understoodthat the employers would  acquiesce  in this  proposal and thatthe operatives would be prepared to commend  the proposal tothe Trades Unions.   The whole of  the Resettlement Committee,proposals have been referred to the Trades Unions  of thebuilding trades.           Subsequently, in view of  the  growth of unemployment,it was decided that it was necessary to press the  building trade to adopt  supplementary proposals under which a con-siderable  number of men would be trained on housing schemesduring this winter,    It  was suggested  that  a number of largehousing schemes should be carried  out entirely by  ex-servicemen working under skilled instructors,  and that men should in this way be trained to be competent  craftsmen  of the                                                   various/
various building trades.   It was proposed that  50,000men should be absorbed Into the building trades  by meansof this special training scheme, eoupled with theBuilding Resettlement Committee1s apprenticeship scheme.This proposal was submitted to the Building Trades Opera-tives Federation in a letter written to the Secretary byDr. Addison.   Arrangements were made for a meeting ofmembers of the Government with&apos;representatives of the operatives on November 3rd.
                    II.  PUBLIC HEALTH.1* Smallpox.  The outbreak of smallpox In the Borough ofMiddleton, Lancashire, to which reference was made in the reporton the work of the Ministry during August last, has continued throughout November, and 29 additional cases were notified duringthe five weeks ended December 4th.    The type of the diseaseIs very mild.2* Report of the Chief Medical Officer,  1919-1920.  This was Issuedduring the latter part of October.3. Tuberculosis. The Ministry have communicated to bounty and county Borough Councils and Insurance Committees the decisions ofthe Ministry of Pensions granting to tuberculous ex-service menwho complete a course of treatment in a sanatorium or training colony pension at the rate of 100 per cent for  the sixmonths following discharge from the institution and at not les3than 50 per cent for the ensuing two years, subject to certain conditions as to periodical examination by the Tuberculosis officer and compliance with his instructions.   The Councils have also been requested to make the necessary arrangements enabling effect to begiven to these conditions.     By the National Health Insurance Act, 1920, It is provided thatSanatorium Benefit shall cease to be included amongst the benefitsconferred, upon insured persons by Part I of the National InsuranceAct,; 1911, at a date not later than twelve months from the passingof ,the 1920 Act., i:..e.. not later than the 20th 1&amp;&amp;J, 1921. It has nowbeen decided that the termination of the Benefit shall take placeon the 1st May, 1921, instead of on the 1st January, 1921, the date which had previously been provisionally determined, and  insurance committees and local authorities have been informed accordingly.4, Foods^   The ninlstry have issued a pamphlet on the special valueof milk as a food for expectant and nunsing  mothers and for infantsand young children and have forwarded copies to local authorities with a covering circular impressing on tfiem the importance ofdissemination of knowledge on this matter\.                                        &apos; v
5. Ma torn ity  and Child Welfare.   On  the  12 th November  the Ministryissued a circular  (No.138)-,  to  the  local  authorities in Englandcarrying out  Maternity and Child Welfare  Schemes, drawing attentionto the serious financial difficulties experienced, by many ofthe Voluntary agencies engaged  in this work.  The Ministryurged, the  local authorities  to  consider the 0,110stion. of renderingsuch  financial assistance to Agencies of  this kind  in their districts  as  the circumstances  might render desirable and pointedout that many of them are carrying  on institutions  which, if theywere  allowed  to lapse, would have to be replaced by institutionswholly financed by the local authority.                      III. GENERAL.1. Poor Lew.  The increase of pauperism mentioned in the reportfor September has proceeded at  a rapid rate, the increase in Londonalone being for the week ended  16th October, 1,182, and. for theweek  ended 23rd October, 3,157.  There is, however, except in thethree cases of Poplar Borough,  Shoreditch and Camberwell, stillbut little evidence of the giving of relief directly on accountof unemployment.  The increase  in the number of persons relievedfor th e week ended the 16th October was  as follows:-Camberwell 17, Shoreditch 119,  Poplar Borough 3S2,  and  in thefollowing  week:-Camberwell 7 02, Shoreditch 1,08^ and Poplar Borough 294.In the latter week there was also an increase of over 300 atHackney.   This great increase of relief in comparativelyisolated Unions suggests that the amount  of relief  given in any area  is determined rather by the policy of the Guardians thanby the extent of distress in the area.     During,November there has been a further increase  inpauperism  in  spite of the reduction in numbers consequent uponthe resumption of industry after the coal strike, and the numberof Unions definitely relieving unemployment by the  grant of
Poor law (cont.,L,outdoor relief has also largely increased in and near London.The total number in receipt of relief in London has risen sincethe 23rd of October by 6,000.   The exact figure cannot at themoment be given for the further increase of relief since the20th November, which, is, in some instances, substantis.l*    OneUnion alone reports that from 1,300 to 1,400 unemployed cases were taken on in the last week of the month.     The principal increases reported of tho numbers of personsrelieved are as follows:-. ,505* j 3 4 1. ^233. .234.  276. .229                Saturday   30th Octobe:               &apos;Greenwich..

The costs of poor  law relief (not  the specific charge ofoutdoor relief) are already largely a common charge in thaMetropolitan area, but such poor law  authorities as West Ham andEdmonton, In both of which distress is acute, have to bear thewhole cost of the relief themselves.
Poor Law (Cont.)     The actual numbers of cases in which outdoor relief  has-beengiven to able-bodied persons and reported to the  Department  forapproval remains comparatively small,  but there  is a  strongtendency to defer or shirk the making  of reports  of the kind,and much of the relief given to the unemployed is relief  in  kindgiven at the discretion of the Relieving Officers and not requiringto be reported,  a table of the reports made is  given below.It may be added that a subsequent report received from Edmontonshows a total of 578 cases.Unions from which, during November 1920, applications have beenreceived In five or more cases for sanction to lepartures fromthe K.R.O.1911,in respect of abTe-bbdled men.

It is intended that in future the central  Department shall not generally intervene in questions of  dietary except on representations made by the Medical  Officer  of the Institution concerned.           An Order   as made by the Treasury  applying the  Pensions* (Increase) Act, 1920, to certain pensioners  of local authorities and particularly to pensioners paid  by the London County  Council
Poor Law (contd.)and to pensioners under the Poor Law Officers and Asylum OfficersSuperannuation schemes.   The Order and the Regulations made bythe Treasury have been circulated with a covering letter to thelocal authorities, etc., concerned,    A conference recently held with representatives of theGovernment Oifices concerned considered the practice of placingout boys from institutions on remote farms, particularly in Wales,and recommended the abandonment of this practice and the use ofJuvenile Employment Committees&apos; advice on the eases where placingout was contemplated,   A memorandum of the recommendations of theconference has been circulated to the authorities responsible forpoor law schools and schools certified under the Poor Law (Certified)Schools Act, 1862.    The quarterly return of cases of persons admitted to poorlaw institutions suffering from clinically well defined deliriumtremens shows a further small increase in the numbers both of malesand females.   All but eleven poor law authorities have furnishedreturns for this quarter.   The numbers compared with those of previous quarters are as follows:-                                           Males      Female s   Quarter ended 31.5,19                   &quot;&quot;35          11      11      11   30.6.19                    45          10      &quot;&apos;      &quot;   30.9,19                    82          24      11      &quot;   31.12.19      &quot;             95          15      11      &quot;   31.3.20                   119          25      11      &quot;   30.6.20                   100          23.      &quot;   &quot;-&apos; &quot;   30.9.20                   115          333. Increase of Local Rates.  The increase of local rates, mentionedon pages 6 and 7 of the Report for June and pages 5 and 6 of theReport for September, has. now been dealt with in a iuemorandum (Cmd.1016) presented to Parliament.   The Memorandum shows that local rates rose gradually during the ten years before the war, roseslightly during the war period,, and have since risen rapidly,-especially in the current financial year (1920-21).    It Is estimated from data set out in the -,memorandum that,taking England and Wales as a whole, the average amount of local rates per pound of assessable, value is in the current year about13/3d. as compared with 6/8-fd.in 1913-14., i.e. it has more than doubled..   In some localities it has much more? than doubled.   For
Increase of Local Rates (cont.)example, in Merthyr Tydfil the totaljr*ate in 1913-14 was  xo/yfu.and is now 26/5d., and in Warrington it was 8/- and is now 21/-    Apart from extravagance,,  limltod to ooartaln ]Lo^*iiU%LasVk -wfcd^ itis within the power of the ratepayers themselves to check, there  isone main general  cauwe of the increase of local rates, viz. the  fallin the purchasing power of money,.    The Memorandum shows by means of a statistical analysis that nearly the whole  of the increase has arisen in respect of thenormal ^ork of the local authorities, which has now been resumed.They, in common with other bodies and private individuals, find themselves in the position of having to pay larger sums of moneythan before the war for the equivalent of the pre-war quantity ofservice and commodities,  These larger sums of money,having, whenlevied as local rates, to be levied on assessable values which forthe most part remain  (subject to a small addition) on a pre-warbasis, are necessarily levied at an increased amount per pound ofthat valuation.  The Memorandum also shows that the restrictionson rents have restricted the rise of assessable values.     Judging from returns received from typical boroughs,  theproportion of the total Increase since 1918-19 which  is attributable to &quot;new  work&quot; In respect of education, highways, public health,  etc.,is small - perhaps 5d. in the pound, or 6 per cent of the total increasein the typical boroughs.     Increases In wages and salaries and the increased cost of commodities account for moat  of the amount of the  increase In rates.     The Memorandum holds out ne expectation of a  great and widespreaddecrease in the amount of the local rates  (as distinguished fromtheir amount per  pound of assessable value) unless  there  is aconsiderable fall  in  the prices  of  commodities and a  consequent fallin the  amount of  wages and salaries.3* yeluatlon for  Local Rating andi Imperial Taxation.  A deputation from the County  Councils -issociation has  been received by representatives  of the Ministry &quot;and the  Board of  Inland Revenue  withreference  primarily to the  basis for the  levy of  county rates.The deputation pressed strongly  the urgent necessity  for  a reform
Valuation for Local Rating and Imperial Taxation (contd,)of the present systems of valuation for local rating and imperialtaxation, so as to provide a single valuation, to be made  on a uniform basis throughout the country, which should supersede the poor rate valuation (made by the overseers of each parishsubject to revision by assessment committees appointed by  theGuardians of the several Poor Law Unions), the county rate basis(made by the County Councils) and the Schedule &quot;A&quot; assessment forthe income tax:(made by Officers of the Inland Revenue).4 *  FarIi amentary Elect ions t          Absent Voters,     The Representation of th.: People (Ho.2)Act, 1920, which admits of the appointment of proxies by allabsent voters likely to be at sea or abroad at the time of an election, prohibits ballot papers being sent to any absentvoter whose recorded address is not in the United Kingdom,Conferences have been helS between representatives of theDepartments concerned to consider the modifications necessaryin the procedure for furnishing at elections the addresses ofnaval or military voters,,   The arrangements adopted as theresult of the Conferences have been communicated in the case ofeach pending bye-election to the Returning Officer*          Autumn Register, 1920.   The new register came  intoforce on the 15th October and will remain in force until  the 15thApril, 1921,          Spring Register, 1921*   At a series  of Conferences.held between the Government Departments concerned, registration officers, and Party Agents, the conclusion was reached  that  theadditional  time recognised as being required for preparing  and printing the registers  of electors can best be  obtained byaltering the qualifying periods fixed by  the Representation  ofthe People Act, 1918;   and it has  accordingly been  decidedthat the six months ending on the  15th December shall be  the qualifying  period for  the Spring Register,  1921*   A  circular                                                          has
has been sent to Registration Officers intimating the registration dates Intended to be prescribed for the register.During November a further circular was addressed to registration Officers referring to certain matters in connectionwith the preparation of the Spring Register, 1921;  It had beenfound on the examination of certain absent voters lists that ahigh percentage of the persons discharged f:om the Forces beforethe lists were prepared were continued on the lists as navalor military voters.  With a view to securing that those personsonly who are naval or military voters are registered in that.capacity, opportunity was taken, after consultation with theAdmiralty, Army Council and Air Council, to refer in the circular to various considerations which should be borne in mindin connection with the registration of such voters,  .
