MEMORANDUM BY TUB SECRETARY  OF  STALL;  FOR INDIA.    The net expenditure on the  military services  in  India  budgeted for  in  the-current  financial  year  1920-21  was  40,000,000/.  The Budget  was,   however,prepared on  a  basis of 11. - Rs. 15, and  on  a basis of  II. -  Rs. 10 the expenditureamounts to no less than 55,000,000/., this figure being arrived  at as follows : Net Expenditure                                          Rs.

It  is relevant to  note  (the reference is to the figures on a Rs. 15 = 11. basis)that the figure of 40,000,000/. budgeted for in the current year compares as followswith the cost of the military services in earlier years :--                                millions.                                millions.

Since the  Budget for 1920-21  was framed various additional liabilities have come forward, and it seems probable  that the military bill for the  year will &quot;not fall short of Rs. 60 crores.  This figure,  no doubt,  includes a  great deal of abnormalexpenditure on  the operations  on  the  North-West  Frontier.   But  there   are,unfortunately, no  grounds for hoping  that the discontinuance of military operationswill be accompanied  by any material lightening  of the present burden of the  cost ofthe army in India.   Thus, while in  a Despatch dated the 22nd  March 1919, theGovernment of India proposed to devote to defence expenditure a  sum of 30,000,0002.per annum  on the basis of Rs. 15   11., and estimated that this sum would leavesome margin after meeting their essential requirements, the substantial improvements which the War Office has. granted in  the pay, &amp;c, of the British Army, and other causes, have obliged  them  to reconsider their position.  In a more  recent Despatch,dated 24th  June  1920, they stated that  the large increases  in  pay  and  pensions ofofficers and men which they had been  compelled to concede during the pasjt  year, thecontinued rise in  the price  of supplies  and military stores,  and the need for improvedaccommodation, hospitals  and equipment,  have  made  it  impossible for them tomaintain  at a cost  of 30,000,000/. an  army of  the strength and  composition con-templated in their &quot;Despatch of the 22nd March 1919 ; but that they were unable inthe present  state of their finances  to exceed  a maximum  sum  of  40,000,000/.(at 11. = Rs. 15) per annum for defence expenditure under normal conditions.     4. It  must be  emphasised that,  while  the  resultant  figure of Rs. 60 crorescorresponds closely  to the actual outlay anticipated  in  the  current year, it does not include any abnormal charges for active operations, or any provision for  the variousimprovements  and commitments contemplated by the Esher Committee,  to which afurther reference is made below.  It is specified as the minimum annual outlayexclusive o^ abnormal capital  charges required  to ensure the protection of  India&apos;sfrontiers and the  preservation of internal security.     5.  The military conception underlying the estimate of Rs. 60 crores is :        (a) to provide a sufficient force to preserve internal security ;      2980    100  12.20
                                        ml        (b)  to provide garrisons on the frontier to prevent tribal unrest and aggression               from spreading unduly or interfering with the concentration of  the field               army, in fact to carry  out  the role of covering troops; the force               estimated under this  heading amounts to, approximately,  12  infantry               brigades, with proportion of other arms and necessary auxiliary services               and transport;        (c) to provide a field force of live  cavalry brigades and. four divisions, with               certain Army troop units.      The consideration of plans of  action in the event of Afghan aggression, with a  probable consequent unrest amongst the frontier tribes, has  brought the Government  of India to the conclusion that the limit of offensive action which  they can undertake  with their field army is an advance either to Jellalabad or to Kandahar;  and the amount  of transport maintained is sufficient only for one of these advances.   The initial force  estimated for  such  offensive action beyond our  frontier is two divisions  and two  cavalry brigades ;  one division and one cavalry brigade would be required  to reinforce  the covering troops of the frontier, leaving one division  and two  cavalry brigades  in  reserve.   Of these,  one-third of the reserve  division is at  the present time already in  Waziristan; and this division, in the event of hostilities,*consequently might also  be  required to furnish troops to carry out  minor operations amongst the frontier tribes.  The two cavalry brigades in reserve  will  probably not be  available  for  another  12 months.      The Government of India have specifically  said that with the force  which they  can  afford, they  cannot  contemplate  any  further  offensive than Jellalabad  or  Kandahar.   The War Office have stated that no provision for  the defence of India  can  be  considered  complete which  does not contemplate an  offensive against the  Afghans of sufficient scope to go to Kabul and Kandahar simultaneously.  To carry out such a project tho Government of India state that they would require  an additional three divisions  and also  the two cavalry brigades  which  will be in reserve,  with a large amount of additional motor transport.  The political situation in India indicates no possibility of setting free more troops from internal defence duties to increase the held army.      The proposed garrison shows  a reduction in combatant troops, over that of the garrison of 1914-15, of  some 7,700 British ranks and 16,200 Indian ranks, a total  of some 24,000.   Any additional funds  which  could be  provided for the service  of the army would have, in the first instance, to be devoted to improving its state of efficiency ; and so far from increasing its size  it is even possible that we  may be  compelled  to contemplate a further reduction.     6.  The separate recommendations embodied in  the Esher Committee&apos;s Report require further consideration in detail, but there is little donbt that the bulk  of them will inevitably have to be given effect to.  Some of them will be insisted  on by public opinion ; the Mesopotamian Report, for example, emphasised the extent of  the leewajr to  be made up owing to the undue economies exercised in the past  on the medical side  and elsewhere.  Others are essential from the purely military point  of  view  or will  be  forced,  on the Government of India in order  to  secure  contentment  in their forces or even recruitment on the necessary scale.   In short, in order  to make good deficiencies from  the past  and to.  bring  up  the machine to reasonable  modern standards  necessitated by India&apos;s  own requirements, heavy additional  expenditure will  be necessitated which will not fall far, if at all. short of  70 crores.     7. What a  defence charge of  this  magnitude  means  to India may  be seen from the  fact that in the current year the ner revenues of the Government of India as a whole (Imperial and Provincial combined) were estimated to amount to  95,000,000L, and an. expenditure of even 55 crores on military services absorbed over 40 per  cent,  of the total.  If account be taken of Imperial transactions only, the percentage will be even more striking, and  the  complete  separation of  the provincial  budgets from the Imperial Budget under the Reforms Scheme will lend  added prominence  to the facts.     8. Among other  statistics prepared  by the  Secretariat of the League of Nations for the  Brussels Financial  Conference are figures to  show the relative  incidence of military expenditure in various  countries (page 14- et aeq of Appendix  I. to Paper No. IV.).  Some of  the more important  figures are  reproduced below.   It  may be explained that  the  figures are those estimated for  1920-21  unless otherwise  stated, and  that the calculations  include net figures only for Government expenditure on therailways, posts  and telegraphs, while  the  figures for expenditure on  defence  excludepensionary charges :

JL10-8II-2 9-1 8-6 3-5 0-6     It may he added that on a consideration of the figures as a whole the Conferenceembodied in their resolutions the following emphatic remarks :       &quot; The statements presented  to the Conference (by  the various countries) showthat,  on an average, some 20 per cent,  of the  national expenditure is still being-devoted  to the  maintenance of armaments  and  the  preparations  for  war.  TheConference&apos; desires to affirm  with the utmost  emphasis that  the world  cannot affordthis expenditure.&quot;     9. The next few years must inevitably be a period of great strain on the  finances-of  the  Government  of  India.   Apart from  the  already heavy burden  of  military expenditure, the Central Government is, under the Reforms Scheme,  passing on tothe provinces  at once nearly nine crores of annual  revenue, and  will further  have to face  insistent claims from  them  for the progressive reduction  of   the  annualcontributions, amounting to nearly 10 crores, which it is  necessary for it to take  from them at the outset of the Reforms towards  creating approximate  equilibrium in  itsfinances.   At  the same time it has to  deal with a top-heavy load of floating and short-term  debt, for which an  early  provision, of adequate  sinking  fund arrangements  isessential.   On the other side, Indian revenues must now  inevitably commence to  feel the reaction from the artificial prosperity which  accompanied  war conditions.  TheCustoms duties  will be affected by the decline in import values  resulting from (a) theeffect on imports of a weak exchange, and (6) the  general fall in the prices of importedcommodities.  The taxes on income, in spite of the tightening up of the administration which is in progress, will feel the  result of greatly contracted profits of trade andindustry.  Slack, trade will also affect the railway earnings,  and these latter will further be encroached on alike by the steadily increasing cost of the administration ofthe railways and by the  cost of  making good the arrears in  the  matter of currentupkeep and maintenance into which  these  inevitably  fell during  the  war.   It has,indeed, already  been intimated by the Government of India that a substantial increaseof taxation will  be necessary to balance their budget for next  year.   In fact,  in India,no less than iu the United Kingdom, a point has been reached when economy in everybranch of the  administration is essential.  But while a. parallel  may be drawn betweenthe position in India and England on its financial and economic side, there is  a radicaldifference in its  political aspect.  In England  the high level  of taxation is, it is true,-causing a growing volume of agitation for economy on  the part of  Government.  InIndia, where taxation is not imposed  by the representatives of the people,&apos; a high levelof taxation, maintained for purposes which India  strongly argues  are  not in India&apos;sbest interests, forms a ready weapon for the extremist agitator hi  his  campaign  forfomenting racial hatred, and can  only form a grave political danger.     10.  A very  important aspect of the matter is the attitude which Indian opinion hasinvariably adopted  towards  military expenditure.  Even in the current year, whilemilitary  operations were still continuing, the Budget estimates came under severe.criticism in the  Legislative Council.   Under the  Reforms Scheme  there  is no doubt.that even the  maintenance of the present level of military expenditure  as a normalmatter will be scrutinised with great jealousy,  entrenching  as it does on the resources available  for  the reduction of  the  contributions payable by  the  provinces to theCentral  Government, and  thus  restricting the  revenues and the activities of the popular Governments in  the Provinces  It  is true that  under  the  Reforms  scheme the Government proposals for defence expenditure will not have to be directly voted.There will, however, be a constitutional opportunity for free comment on them duringthe general discussion of the Budget.  Moreover-, whenever the question of imposing
additional taxation arises (as it will inevitably do in the coining year), the bill or billsembodying the taxation proposals will  require to  be  submitted to the vote of  theAssembly.   The prospect of obtaining the concurrence of the non-official majority inadditional  imposts, which it  will  certainly look on  as  necessitated  by unjustifiablyhigh military  expenditure, can  only  be regarded as most  remote,  and  it seemsimpossible to hope that the Government of India will be able  to cajole  a Legislative&apos;Assembly, which is not allowed to vote-on the substantive question of grants for  theArmy, into  accepting  taxation which is necessary in order to  provide these grants.Indeed, any attempt to do so may have  the disastrous  result of driving the growingmoderate party, on whose strength the future of the reformed constitution  depends,into the arms of the extremists.     11. I have thought.it  necessary to put the position at some length before  mycolleagues because it is of more than  local importance.  I hope I have  made it clearthat India will  not be  able, even with increased taxation, to  pay lor an army larger than is  necessary  for an offensive-defensive  on the smallest possible scale on  theNorth-West Frontier.  It is even possible-at all events  it seems the only practicableway of effecting a substantial reduction in expenditure, if such should be forced upon us that we may have  to limit ourselves to a purely passive defence, whereby we may perhaps save a  division.&apos;  In any case it is definitely impossible for  ns  to accept  theview of the Imperial General Staff, who regard an advance to Kandahar and Kabul asan essential part of the defence of  the Indian frontier and would have India  maintain an army large enough  for  that purpose.  It is  also definitely  impossible for us tomake any contribution to Imperial defence, whether in the form of (a) a subsidy basedon population, (6) an increased capitation grant, (c) an increased contribution to the costof the Royal Navy ; (d) the maintenance of an Indian Navy (at present);  and I would ask  those of my colleagues who are directly concerned to note this.   Finally, it isdefinitely impossible for us to embark on any grandiose schemes  of military expansionsuch as have been hinted at in the Esber Committee&apos;s Report and in other  quarters.So far as India  is concerned, all idea  of initiating as a normal peace measure a scheme,whereby she is to become the base for vast military operations in the Middle and Far-East, must  be definitely  abandoned ; if public  opinion in India  would  tolerate  it,Indian revenues. cannot bear  the  charge.  Even more modest schemes, under whichIndia is to be asked to  furnish large military garrisons in the Middle East  in  times ofpeace, will have to be modified.  In short, we  must  definitely get out of our headsthe vague idea  too  often entertained, that India is an  inexhaustible  reservoir fromwhich men and money  can be drawn  towards the support of Imperial resources or inpursuance of Imperial strategy.     12. I do not know whether the fact that India must now play a humble part involves a revision of Imperial strategy.   The whole question is, perhaps, one that should bethrashed out by  the Committee  of  Imperial  Defence, who may possibly be able tosuggest some way in which, within the  limits of the expenditure indicated above,  the effectiveness of the Army in India can be increased, and I need hardly say that anyadvice which they or the Imperial General Staff may be able to give will be welcome.I hope to make  some suggestions myself, as to which! am consulting the Governmentof India.  But  my immediate object  is to put my colleagues in full possession of  thef cictjs         India Office,                                                E. S.
