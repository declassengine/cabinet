I. NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION  IN UNITED KINGDOM ON                           DECEMBER 17, 1920.    The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent.    The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unem-ployment figures, was 4-7 per  cent.  It was  as high  as 7-8  per  cent, in 1908 and7-7 per cent, in 1909.    Throughout 1919  it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent.in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.    The figures for 1920 are :                                  Per cent.

Unemployment  is  still  increasing in practically all  parts of the country,although the usual seasonal trade and special Post  Office  work at Christmas isabsorbing a certain number of men.  The  increases in the Exchange Live Registersare in  some cases due to the registration of workpeople who are now  entitled to unemployment benefit under the new Act for the first time.   There are, however,considerable numbers of workpeople who have been unemployed since the Act came into force,  and  are, therefore, not entitled to  benefit, and in many  cases areunregistered.  The depression previously reported in the woollen and cotton textile industries and in the boot and shoe trade  continues, and the latter is practically ata standstill.  Some manufacturers in the boot and shoe trade expect a revival earlyin the New  Year, but this opinion is by no means general. The clothing and hosiery
trades also continue to be very slack.  In the iron and steel industry the position is becoming worse, and the same may be said of the Welsh tinplate industries, whereinlarge numbers of men are under notice.  It is again reported that the engineering and shipbuilding industries are suffering from a shortage of  orders.  Moreover,English are unable to compete with foreign firms, owing to the  relatively low prices and definite dates of delivery quoted by the latter.  Again, the continuance of thejoiners&apos;  strike is now seriously affecting some of the shipbuilding firms in the north of England.  In some cases shortage of material is also given as a reason for theslackness in the shipbuilding yards.   The recent  severe weather  is temporarilyaffecting employment in the building trade and in agriculture.  Very severe distressnow exists among the unemployed both in London and other large towns, and LocalAuthorities are everywhere putting in hand as much relief work  as possible.                         II. EMERGENCY WORK.    The  Prime Minister made  a statement in the  House  of  Commons on  the19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment.He outlined schemes  fdr  employing  a large  number  of  fit  ex-Service  men  inconnection  with  the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the tradeunions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme forarterial roads  in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time  pressing forward with  the Ministry of Transports programme of  road  classification andmaintenance grants.
