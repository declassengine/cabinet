ANKIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).5XCHEQ.UER.       The Cabinet has resolved that &quot;except with Cabinet authorityschemes Involving expenditure not yet in operation are to remainin abeyance&quot;.   Decisions are urgently required as to the appllca-tion of this resolution to (a) Continuation Schools (b) certain proposals cf the Burnham Committee recommending increases in the pay of elementary and secondary school teachers.       1 circulate a note which has been prepared at my requestin consultation with the Board of Education as to the cost cfthese schemes.       As regards Continuation Schools, Mr, Fisher and I are agreedthat no more &quot;appointed days&quot; be given at present, and that localauthorities be informed accordingly.     I urge further that local authorities to whom appointeddays have been given  be urged to suspend their schemes.   Tothis Mr. Fisher demurs.   He is not prepared to do more than agreeprivately that if they ask on their own initiative for slowing down or partial suspension he will allow It.       As regards the Burnham Committee Ms Schemes we are agreed -    (1),  That with a view to slightly  lessening the immediateburden on the Exchequer and the rates, the  &quot;carry over&quot; from theold  scales  of salary to the; new should be epread over  four yearsInstead of  three as proposed by the Committee.    (il) - That Government Grant bo withheld  from authorities whichpay salaries- in -excess of the scales proposed by the Committee.(Intlld.). A..C.Sit. 121 20*Treasury.
  X.  CONTINUATION SCHOOLS, (1) By the Education Act of 1918all local education authorities are required to provideContinuation Schools and to submit acfcsEies for that purpose to the Board of Education.   Tho local authorities throughoutthe Country have had the matter under consideration andtheir projects are in various stages of forwardness.Up to the present there are only two areas viz. Rugby andS trat ford-on-Avon In which Continuation Schools have actually been opened under the Act;  there are five others viz:London, Birmingham, West Ham., Swindon and Southend to whichthe Board of Education have given appointed days for bringing into operation the clause in the Act requiringyoung persons age 14 to 16 to attend, the school.  (il) The appended table shows the maximum number of youngpersons to be provided for in Continuation Schools for thenext few ye*rs In those areas.  (Ill) On the supposition that these seven places proceedto carry out their schemes as fully as possible and that no more appointed days are given to other areas, the costfalling on the Board*s Vote is estimated at :-1921-22                           300,0001922-23                           600.000 to  700.0001923-24 and thereafter until1928.                             750,000 to  900,000An equal amount would fall upon the rates of the areas concerned: the arrangement beins that the cost is shared        NOTE; AS TO THE CHARGES LIKELY TOPALL ON THE VOTE OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE FROM CERTAIN SCHEMES ALREADY IN HANDOR UNDER CONSIDERATION RELATING TO (I) CONTINUATIONSCHOOLS. (2) IMPROVEMENT OB&apos; SALARIES OF TEACHERS IKELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. (3) IMPROVEMENT 0?&apos; SALARIES OF           TEACHERS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS.
equally between rates and grant *  (Iv)  Theso estimates are open to some doubt especially 1in regard to the amount sot down for the * years 1922-25 and.192^-24.   It may be assumed that no fresh buildings willbe erected for the purpose of Continuation Schools, and existing buildings suitable for the purpose may bodifficult to obtain.   On the one hand the scarcity ofsuch buildings would probably result, if the authoritiespress on,, In an increase in the cost to the localauthorities cf hiring and adapting.them\  on the etherhand in consequence of the scarcity of buildings thelocal authorities might be unable to provide places forthe full number upon whose attendance the estimates given above are based.        (v) If the operations which have been begun in theseseven areas were discontinued, the Authorities would nodoubt claim reimbursement from the State in respect ofexpenditure and commitments already  incurred,,        It appears from enquiries which have been madeby the Board of Education  that there might be a claim from london alone for about  220,000 besidea  acme further sumsnot ascertainable in respect  of premises that have beentaken on leases to run for  several  years..  2.    IMPROVED SCALES OF  SALARY  FOR ELEMENTARY  SCHOOLTEACHERS.   There are about 170,000  teachers  In the elementary schools,  and the amounts  of  their  salaries are          1913-14               16,400;COO          1910-20               51.556^000          192C-31               40,228,000*There  is great  variation  in the  scales  at  present in  forcein different areas,  and for more  than a year  past a JointCommittee representative  of the  local education authoritiesone  the one  side  and the  teachers  on the other has been                                            /sitting
 sitting  under the  Chairmanship  od  Lord Burnham  in order to  deal  with the  subject.-   The first report  of  this Committee recommended a  provisional  minimum to  which all scales should  be  at  least brought up in those areas in  which the scales formerly in existence fell  below  it. This recommendation was  carried out  in the spring of  1920.   (il)   The Committoe have  now  made  further recommendations for standardising  salaries  on a system which  will allow of  a limited amount of variation between different  kinds of  areas, so that  in  the end all salaries will  be on  one of  four  typical standard scales.   In the meantime  changes have still been going on in the scales  in force locally so  that  some areas are already at the highest point to which, the recommendations of Lord Burnham5s Committee if carried  out would bring, them;   while other Authorities have been awaiting the Report of the Committee  and  the decision of the Government upon it,   (iii)  It is now estimated, -  (but  this  estimate  Is necessarily precarious since it anticipates the decisions that might be made as to the re-classification  of  theareas for the purpose  of salary scales)  - that the  Committee1s latest recommendations would result, so far as  affects the 170,000 teachers now  in the elementary  sohoels, in the addition to the total salary bill of a.  sun amounting eventually a to  5,000,000 per annum as a charge upon rates  and taxes together?  the share  of this&apos; which would eventually fall  on the rates would be  2,000,000  and the share which would eventual- ally fall upon the Board!s Vote would bo  3,000,000 per annum, - a sum payable for the first time in the year following that In which the Increase takes p^ace.    (lv)  Lord Burnham1a Committee have made certain proposals as to the stages by which the  change from the present      K salaries to  the proposed standard salaries should be made; and if these recommendations are followed; it is estimated, (but here again the  estimate is precarious) that the  increased                                /expenditure                        *tb  i-j;  art

SALARIES OP TEACHERS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS.   A Joint  Committee representing the teachers and the local education  authorities also sat under Lord Burnhamis Chairmanship for  the purpose Of recomm.ehd.ing improvements in the salaries  of teachers in secondary schools.   The salaries have nott up&apos;4to the present been brought to any minimum standard.   Lord,St  Burnham,s Committee has made recommendation for two standard  scales, one in London and one in the rest of the country,  If these scales are adopted not only in the schools maintain;?! .by the local education authorities but also in the school 5
