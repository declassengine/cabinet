(1)    The Government have given very olose consideration to       the  request that a State  Monetary Guarantee should be provided       to cover  the BuiKlag Trade Operatives against the risk of       inoreased unemployment, as  a result of the absorption in the       Trades of 50,000 e^-Service men.  Since the meeting of       November  3rd the Government has had submitted to it a seri&amp;s       of calculations prepared  by the Government Actuary designed to       cover various possible risks.  Though In all human --robability       a State guarantee  could be  given without any prospect&apos; whatever       that it would ever become operative - in view of the very great       arrears of Building T/ork  awaiting execution and the shortage in       the  numbers of the skilled  men in the Building Trades compared with       pre-war - the Government  cannot agree to this.   Though, as said,       in this particular case and for the reasons stated the prospect       that such a guarantee would ever be needed is very remote indeed,       the  Government are of the opinion that the principle involved       is wrong.            The  true method of providing effective insurance against       possible  unemployment is  to be found in the Unemployment       Insurance Act of the present year.  That Act provides a benefit       of 15/- a week which, if  the Trade union cares to become the       agency for administration,  become 20/- a week by an additional       contribution of 5/- a week  from Trade union funds,
   further, under Section 20 of the Act, the Employers   and Employed in any Industry can get together and devise a   Supplementary Scheme of its own.   It has been calculated   that  if the Employers and Employed in this case each subscribe   6d. a week or thereabouts - additional to their weekly   contributions under the State Scheme of 4d. a week each - a   benefit of 30/- a week would be possible  (as against the 15/-   of the Act).   The Government are prepared to use every effort   with  the parties concerned In an endeavour to bring them   together with the view to securing the establishment ^   of such a Supplementary Scheme.(2)       The Government is of opinion that the absorption Into the   Industry of  a considerable number of ex-Service men as  adult   Apprentices  or Trainees with  a  view to becoming skilled   craftsmen  should be commenced forthwith.   With regard  to the   numbers  to be  absorbed, these should be  on the basis of one in   five  calculated  on  the number of  skilled men in the whole    industry.    Variations of the percentage  to be allowed  in   different Trades;   provided  always  that  the highest   percentages  should  be  applied to  the  three branches of  the    industry where  the  need  was  greatest, namely, Brick-layers,   Slaters  and  Tilers, and  Plasterersj   provided  also    that the  minimum number  of men  thus  admitted who  will    ultimately become  skilled workmen in  the Industry    shall be not less  than 50)000.    The  proportions  to    be admitted in the  various  crafts above  specified to    be arranged wltte the  Minister of  Labour.     The Government will arrange  liberal  ratesof payment to the skilled men who Instruct  the new entrants.                             : j
     The Government accept the prinoiple  of a guaranteed rate of pay on housing operations for timelost owing to wet and inclement weather,  subject tothe Trade Unions aeoopting the augmentation set out inparagraph 2;  and are prepared to provide for theapplication on Housing Schemes of this principle onthe following basis, viz*-     wIn the  case  of a man  employed, or standing by  to work on  a Job when  called upon, for a full&apos;week,  the payment for  time lost through stress of weather  shall be 50 per  cent,  in  respect of time lost up to  22 hours per week, in the  case of time lost in  excess of 22 hours, the hours lost over and above 22  hours shall be paid for at  the rate of 75 per cent.  of the time rate&quot;.     Details  of the arrangements will be sent forthwith to the Local  Authorities and  others engaged, or to been gaged, on Housing Schemes.&quot;                           (intd)  T,  J. Ii.20.
