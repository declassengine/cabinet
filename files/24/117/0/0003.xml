This  document is the property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.SECRET.                     ..          3CP. 2303.                               THE CABINET.SHORT  TIME IN  GOVERNMENT  FACTORIES.      MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR  WAR.    I circulate herewith a note by the Surveyor-General of Supply on  the question of.working short time at Woolwich and other National Factories.                                                                     w. s. c.  The War Office,       16th December, 1920.    As requested, I have considered the effect of adopting the principle of short time at Woolwich and other national factories.  I have also asked the  Director-General of factories, and  the  Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories, to consider  whethereffect could be  given to the policy, and what practical difficulties would arise.    I will deal with Woolwich first, as this raises  special considerations which do notapply to anything like the same extent at other factories.    I take it that the main object of the Cabinet is to absorb unemployed.  If this is so, it is estimated that up to about 2,000 additional men could be employed at Woolwich(if obtainable of the right sort) by working the men in relays of  three weeks out of four.   If it is intended to  spread the  present work over a  longer period withoutabsorbing additional men, the best that can be proposed is to make a cut of 25 per cent.in the hours worked by closing down Fridays and Saturday mornings.    Whichever arrangement is adopted, I am informed that the following&apos; practicaldifficulties will have to be faced :     (i.) Short  time means reducing  the weekly  wages of over  10,000 men in the           Ordnance  Factories alone  by 25  per  cent.  This  will raise a storm of           opposition from  the men.   Already,  as  a  result of  the Chancellors           statement  in  the House last Thursday,  the mens leaders  at  Woolwich           have stated  definitely that they will accept no short time unless they are           guaranteed in full their present weekly wage.  Is the Government prepared           to  pay  all these  men full time for working three-quarter  time, and is this           cost to  fall on the War Office ?    (ii.) Difficulty  of subsequently discharging men  absorbed  for an  indefinite period           and for whom full time work does not now exist.    (iii.) Employment of additional supervisory staff and skilled men to train and  deal           with  the additional workers, most of whom are likely to be  unskilled men.    (iv.) Differentiating  those  who must work full  time (i.e.,  the pivotal men,  who           represent approximately 30 per cent, of the total number employed in the           Ordnance Factories).  This will cause much discontent.    (v.) Withdrawal of  all promises as to deliveries and prices.   Whatever meaning           may  be attached to the term  &quot; urgency,&quot; Woolwich is at present under           definite instructions to complete either  at the earliest possible date or before           the end of  the  financial year armoured cars, tanks, wagons (new and           repaired),  medals,  coins,  repairs  of  guns  and  carriages,  naval  work,           alternative work.    (vi.) Falling off in the quality of Woolwich production, and seriously retarding the           steps which are now being taken in the following directions :                     Reorganization of administration ;  improvement in manufacturing               efficiency ; effecting economies in  working ; securing  alternative work               in place of unnecessary armament  work.   (vii.) Increase in cost of all work in hand  owing to  the increased  time  over which           the  Ordnance   Factories  overhead   charges  would   be  spread.   The           establishment charges run on continuously.   This will  render it still more           difficult to obtain additional work in future.(J320/506)  100 12/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.  8798wo
    Apart from  these  practical difficulties, there are,  in  my  opinion, the strongest possible objections on political grounds to the adoption  of short time at Woolwich.  Ata time  when  the Government are urging  increased  individual output, it  would bea mistake for them  to  introduce  a policy in their  principal  factory  of  spreadinga limited amount of work over a larger number of employees.    The Cabinet should appreciate what is  entailed from the point of view of the men.I am convinced that there will be strong, if not bitter,  opposition from them.    Repeated promises of alternative work have been made by the Prime Minister andother Ministers.   At a  recent deputation received by the  Finance Member, I had thegreatest difficulty in convincing the men that the promise of alternative work wasstrictly confined  to the facilities  at  present existing at Woolwich,  and that on this basis everything possible was being done to give them such work.    There is a further point.   The men will urge that the Governments scheme (likemany schemes of economy) will hit the lower-paid man at the worst time of the year.The skilled men and supervisory staff will not be affected.    The other factories are in a different position from Woolwich.    At Enfield it was found possible, a few months ago, to put  piece-workers on short time by limiting  their work  to the extent of 15 per cent.   At Walthani short time isnow being worked  to the extent  of 2j hours a week.  I  believe further reductions would be possible  at both factories.  The opposition from the men would, of  course, be strong,  but I think could   be  more  effectively  met than would  be  the case withWoolwich.    I see no serious difficulty in putting Gretna,  Queensferry, Swindon and Herefordon  short time, but Director-General of Factories advises that it would  be inexpedient to apply the principle to the  Lancaster Factory.
