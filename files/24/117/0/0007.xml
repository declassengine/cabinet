This  document is the property of  His Britannic Majestys Government.- -SECRET.c.p.  ms,THE  CABINET.MESOPOTAMIAN  ADMINISTRATION.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.    I circulate  herewith  observations by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, on certain points raised by the Secretary of Statefor  India  in  his  memorandum  of 23rd July  (CP.  1680)  concerning  the military administration in Mesopotamia.  The salient features of Mr. Montagu&apos;s criticism  weretelegraphed to Sir A. Haldane as a series of allegations on  which his remarks  weresought and which are printed in italics at the head of each section.    I have shown these  observations to the Secretary of  State for  India, whoseremarks are printed as an  Appendix.                                                                    W. S. C.  The War Office,        16th December, 19?0.1.  The fighting value of the larger force is no greater than that of the smaller force to      which it was hoped at one time that the garrison might be reduced.    The fighting value of the troops in Mesopotamia has not been greatly in excess ofthat of a complete and fully trained Division.    British regiments and battalions  are insufficiently trained and weak, and  Indianbattalions  undertrained  and on a low establishment.  Constant operations, and movesimposed by them, have reduced opportunities for training to a minimum, and compulsorydetachments have taken away numbers available for active operations.2.  Too many  battalions are being used to guard Turkish prisoners and Assyrian      refugees.    Turkish prisoners of war, whose numbers fluctuated between 18,000  and  15,000,were formed into a Labour Corps and employed mainly at  Basrah, Kut, Baghdad andShergat.   The troops  employed  in  guarding  them amounted to an aggregate  ofapproximately four Indian battalions.  In  order to reduce these numbers of  regulartroops guarding Turkish prisoners,  Labour  Corps personnel, ex-soldier  and other, havebeen attested  and trained  to the  number  of  approximately 2,500, thus  releasing altroops from  the  duty of guarding prisoners and reducing administrative  guards.   Notroops are  used to guard Assyrian refugees;  the Assyrian battalion provided all guardsin  the refugee camp  from August,  1919, and, by taking over certain outside duties atBaqubah, enabled all regular troops to be withdrawn from there.13.  The Inland Water Transport fleet being  retained by  the  military administration is      much in excess of what  might  be considered a reasonable reserve,  and its wage      bill is over 200,0001* a month.    (i.) The following is  a precis of the tonnage requirements from January to June,1920, showing the need  for fleet maintained.    The steel of the Basrah Baghdad railway line was linked up on the 16th January,1920.    From  January to June, 1920, the  tonnage required from Baghdad and the forward area approximated to 750 tons daily.  Of this amount the Basrah Baghdad railway                     * Presumably 200,000 rupees is meant.(B20/447) 100  12/20  H&amp;S, Ltd  8689&apos;wo
 was able  to carry, in the early part of the year, an average of 200 tons daily, with a maximum of  3,000  tons  over a period, of 10 days.   The remaining&apos; capacity of the railway was  occupied  with  civil  freight,  railway  material, &amp;c.   The  Inland Water Transport fleet  had, therefore, to  carry the  balance (550  tons) daily from  Basrah to Kut,  with a  small special  tonnage approximating to 30 tons* per diem through to Baghdad.   The  Inland Water Transport fleet was  maintained at  a  carrying capacity of 600 tons per diem, i.e., 50 tons reserve,&quot;with the  promise of reduction wHen feasible.     In June the railway situation was better, and the railway administration was able to undertake  to carry  an additional 100  tons  per diem.   The  situation is not yet, however, such as to admit  of the  dispersion of the  craft which  had hitherto carried these  100  tons.     It was accordingly decided, so as to meet the wishes of the Army Council and at the same  time to  guard the safety of His Majesty&apos;s  Forces, to offer on  loan, with the prospect of delivery, the craft to those civilian firms which had purchased them.     It may here be stated  that the  sale of the fleet took place on  16th June.   By 1st July,  248  craft had been declared deliverable,  and,  in  addition. 73  craft had been  prepared for overseas.   More  craft would   have  been  delivered, but  on  the examination of the terms of  the sale it was found that the State would, by delivering, suffer  a heavy financial loss.   On  28th July, 1920, the declaration of any craft as deliverable was stopped w enable  the situation to be reviewed.    Since that date  25 craft have been re-taken up and four have been declared deliverable.   As the situation improves so will  more craft be re-declared deliverable.     (ii.) Paragraph (i.) above gives  the facts as they existed before the outbreak of the present  hostilities, and  shows the practicable need for the retention of the Inland Water Transport fleet up to  GOO tons.     At  the  outbreak of hostilities, however, reasons  for the retention of the Inland Water Transport fleet  which, prior to that time, were theoretical, became paramount. Two possibilities presented themselves :      (a.) It might, through  hostile action,  be impossible to use the  railway  line           between Kut  and Baghdad for a  prolonged  period,  while that from Basrah           to Baghdad would, from the first, cease to be available as a through  line.     (b.) The danger from heavy floods, such as during April, prevented the Kut line           from being used for a fortnight.     The first  of these  possibilities  no longer  belongs  to  the region of theory.  the cutting of the Basrah Baghdad  line at once caused  the  tonnage which was beingcarried by the Inland Water Transport  fleet to  be raised to 1,000 tons a day, andhad not this fleet still existed with  a carrying capacity of 60u tons a day, the demandsof the  situation could not have been met.     I  have no hesitation in  stating that without  the  Inland  Water Transport fleetit  would have been impossible to maintain the army  north of Baghdad.   Moreover, thedispersion  of the fleet, in conjunction with the temporary or prolonged interferencewith the railway communication, would have obliged any troops  arriving at Basrah,which  might have been required to proceed to Baghdad, to  march  the whole  distance.I might add that, under the conditions above  referred to, I should have had to rely on civil water transport for the evacuation to the base of the sick and wounded.     (iii.) The statement that the monthly bill of the  Inland Water Transport is overrupees 200,000  is perfectly correct.   As a matter of  fact it is over rupees 250,000.     As a  set-off to the wages bill and the costs of running must be placed  a  total ofrupees 6,734,250, being the gross receipts on account of tonnage carried for the year.     An actual balance profit of rupees 96,000 is thus obtained on the working of the inland Water Transport for one year.4.  Lavish expenditure upon swollen  administrative staffs.     (i.) The Quartermaster-Generals staff in Mesopotamia is in strength equivalent tothat of a command in Engiand.     (ii.) The troops in a  Command in  England are accommodated in  barracks withstabling, &amp;c, with  municipal water supplies, electric light and.  modern conveniences.They live  &quot; at  home&quot; under an old existing  organization  where  all their wants arecatered for.* Note. &apos;60 tons Basrah to Baghdad requires the same tonnage as 60 tons Basrah to Kut.
    (iii.) Mesopotamia is the antithesis; the troops are accommodated in tents fromBasrah in the south to 100 miles beyond Mosul in the north, and from Hit in the west to the Caspian and Ahwaz in the east.    (iv.) Here everything  that is  done for the  comfort of the troops  has to beimprovised, and until the strength and permanent location of the -garrison  are  decided upon  the  policy must be  indeterminate, adding  greatly to the administrative work.Moreover, the climate for four months in the year is  trying, and the domination of thesun adversely affects everything.    (v.) The &quot;Q&quot; staff  is  concerned  with  normal  peace  policy  measures, and  the routine work of feeding,  equipping and mdntaining a force  of 21,000 British,  210,000Indian (including labour and refugees), and 40,000 animals.  These numbers far exceed those  of any command at home and have many scales of rations and ordnance demands,also separate rules and regulations  and establishments.   In addition  to the above,the &quot;Q&quot; staff has during the past  months  been engaged in the  following  greaterproblems:     (a.) The preparation for the arrival in the country, and  for the  first move from the           plains  to a hill station at Karind,  of  all the  married families.  These plans           entailed  the  movement of 1,000  women  and children.   It  was necessary           to provide at  short notice every accessory of household requirements such as           furniture, glass, china, linen, cutlery, &amp;c, both in the plains and in the hills.           Furniture had to be purchased from India, Rangoon, Singapore and England.           A small amount of furniture was procurable locally, but,  after the first day&apos;s           purchase, the price of deal cupboards rose to 100/. a piece ; consequently all           further transactions  had  to be completed overseas.    (6.) A constant succession of small wars, often two at a time from January onwards,           during which time it may be affirmed that most of the units in Mesopotamia           had   changed  tbejr  stations at   least  once,  necessitating  a constant           re-arrangement of reserve supplies, &amp;c.    (c.) At  the  present time  the  administration  of the force required  to  quell a           rebellion throughout Mesopotamia, which has necessitated the arrival of an           extra division from overseas, coupled with the interference with the railway           services throughout  the country and the re-expansion of the Inland Water           Transport.    (vi.) Other tasks not  usually thrown on  a  Command in England, which claimattention  day by day here, are :     (a.)   The passing of the country from military to civil control.  Correspondence           and decisions regarding railways, public works, E. and M.  Directorates,           the port  and  docks  at Basrah, also  posts  and telegraphs have to  be dealt           with.    (h.) The initiation of an organization for  collecting hay, for growing vegetables,           and for dairy farms.    (c.) The problem of  oil distribution for civil and military throughout the country.    (d.)  Supervision of Labour Directorate.    (e.) Supervision of Inland Water  Transport and all  river problems contingent on           500 miles of river transport both  on the Tigris and  Euphrates.    (/.)  Dealing with overseas tonnage up to approximately 30,000 tons in ten days.    [g.) Direct correspondence  with War Office, Army Headquarters,  India, Egypt,           Black  Sea, Civil Commissioner, &amp;c.    (h.) The care  of                15,000 Turkish  prisoners of war.               24,000 Assyrian refugees.               16,000 Armenian refugees.               700  Russian internees.    (i.) The  difficulty of billeting  in Baghdad  and Basrah, where  the  accommodation           is insufficient to meet  the requirements of both  the civil  and  military           administrations.    (j.) Preparation of a scheme for the building of cantonments throughout Mesopotamia.           for the post-war garrison, staff offices, hospitals, dep6ts and workshops.    (k.) Negotiations for the purchase of land involved in the above scheme.    (8689)
      (I.) The lack of communication with England demands the giving of decisions and             the taking of greater responsibility than would be in the case in a command             at home.      (vii.) The administrative staff on  its present basis is; I consider, inadecpiate to do more than perform its ordinary routine duties.   The  strength does not suffice for that close supervision which is essential if economies are to be  effected.  In consequence the administrative system of the army in Mesopotamia merits the attribute &quot;Extravagant&quot; in so far as  its weak numerical strength unavoidably perpetuates evils which are patent and which will continue to flourish  so  long as  this system remains unaltered.   I have previously pointed out the necessity for the appointment  of an administrative officer of rank who  should be provided with a carefully chosen and strong (numerically) staff, and I take this  opportunity of reiterating my request.   Economies  are,  I am  convinced, possible in  many directions, but  they will  not be  secured unless an  able staff is forthcoming, which,  besides  routine work, can undertake such questions  as &quot; Local Purchase,&quot;  &quot;Losses  and  Deficiencies,&quot;  &quot;Labour and its Importation  from  India,&quot; &quot;Reduction  of  Transportation  Charges&quot; and  other  questions  enumerated in the preceding  paragraph,   Besides these questions  there  are  others  such as the establish- ment of sick  dep6ts  and  convalescent camps in Persia for  occupation  during the summer months by British troops, and the accommodation  of schools of instruction at such camps and elsewhere.      All such matters  demand time  and care if they are to be dealt with properly, and the cost of the increased administrative staff  for a few years would  be amply repaid by the saving which it would effect.   (viii.) The Adjutant-General^ Staff  at General Headquarters approximates to that of a Command at home ;  the  size of  the area, communications and numbers to be administered in the two commands cannot be compared.      Correspondence is conducted with  Army Headquarters in India as well as with the War Office.   Two codes of military law and discipline are administered  and two sets of enlistments, discharge,  demobilization add pay regulations dealt with.      When  serving out of India the Indian Army requires increased co-ordination of matters connected with religion, funerals and kindred questions, and in  this country additional problems present  themselves, connected  with  the establishment  of a new civil Government and  the change from military to civil control of  the country.      The Adjutant-General^ Branch consisting of:                   Assistant Adjutant-General,                  2 Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-Generals,                  1 Staff Captain, is not too large to deal  with  these matters  and would benefit by an  increase of 1 Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General and 1 Staff Captain to enable closer touch with formations to be kept  by means of personal visits. 5. Officers are making excessive use of Government motors for recreation.     The War Office has been kept fully informed on this subject.     All touring cars are pooled, except those  specially detailed for the General Officer commanding-in-Chief; Divisional Commanders; General  Officer  Commanding,  Biver Area ; General Officer Commanding, 7th Cavalry Brigade ; Brigadier-General, General Staff; and Brigadier-General, Artillery.     Hiring of cars was only permitted between  14.00  hours and  23.00 hours, and this privilege has been temporarily suspended since 9th August owing  to the destruction by fire of the mechanical transport stores. 6. The General  Officer- Commanding  and the whole of General Headquarters  staff       imthdrew to the hills on the outbreak  of trouble in the Mosul Vilayet, leaving       only a Lieutenant-Colonel to represent them at Baghdad.     The outbreak of trouble  in  the Mosul Vilayet was  met  and  dealt with locally without  trouble.   At  that time the situation in North-West  Persia seemed more critical than  anywhere else, and I proceeded on  5th  June  to Teheran to consult and confer with Sir Percy  Cox and the new Minister together, and  to see for myself themilitary position.   My  visit was carried through with no delays beyond  such as were
5necessary for a very brief inspection of troops, and  a hurried visit to the  Menjill Passand for the overhaul on two occasions of the cars which I utilized.   On  the morning of 18th June I arrived again in Baghdad, having passed two nights in the train andcovered 1,100 miles in motor car during my absence from headquarters.     Major-General Leslie, who  commanded Mesopotamia between -the time of GeneralMacMunn&apos;s departure and my arrival in Baghdad, was in Baghdad as my representative and  was fully acquainted with  the situation.   My  General Staff (less one  officeraccompanying me) and a representative  of the  Administrative  Staff  remained in baghdad.                          (Signed)    A. Haldane, Lieut.-General,                                                   Commanding-in- Chief,                                             Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force.   20th September, 1920.APPENDIX.                  Note by the Secretary  of State for India.    The Secretary of State for War has very kindly shown me his Memorandum and asked me if I wished to make any remarks on  it.   I should like to say two things only.    1. The purpose of my Memorandum of 23rd July was not to make  &quot;allegations,&quot;but to  show that the present very heavy cost of the garrison of Mesopotamia  is notnecessarily the future cost.  I wanted to show this in order to meet the  argument,which  has just been revived, that because the army  in  Mesopotamia  is  costing x millions a year, and because we cannot afford  x millions, the only alternative is tohave  no army  in  Mesopotamia.   My point was that the cost is  at present excessive,partly for unavoidable reasons the use,of troops for administrative purposes, guardingprisoners, and the like, the effect of which is to reduce the fighting power of the presentforce  to that  of a force half its size partly for the avoidable reason of insufficientlycontrolled expenditure.  And  the  inference which I intended to be drawn was that,when normal peace conditions are restored, both these sets of reasons will  disappear, andthe cost of the Army of Occupation will fall automatically.     I may have been mistaken in one or two  points of detail, but it seems to me thatGeneral Haldane^s very candid replies to the so-called &quot; allegations&quot;  practically admitmy. case, and I hope my colleagues will duly note them.  There seems to be no  reasonin the nature of things why a division in Mesopotamia should cost  substantially morethan  a division in, e.g., India.     2. I  do not wish to go into the details of General Haldane&apos;s movements in june and July, and  I do not complain of his visit to Tehran.   V^hat I thought, and stillthink, an error of judgment on his part was the removal of  himself and his head-quarters  to summer quarters at Karind, in  Persia.  Such a move  was not thought necessary by his predecessors,  and seems to me  to have been peculiarly inconvenient inthe conditions prevailing last summer.
