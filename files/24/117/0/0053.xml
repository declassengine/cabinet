259(ffilS DOpUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)CP.  2 31QLCABINET.          WOOERS1 SHARE IN MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY,                (In certain foreign countries).             NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT,          In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet60(20), the Minister of Labour has circulated a note inwhich the Ministry of Transport has collaborated so far asrailways are concerned.   I wish to add the following note:-          Before the War labours participation in managementwas, so far as my information &amp;oes, non-existent.   Even inthe case of conciliation it was comparatively new.   Sincethe War the railway conditions in most countries intimatelyaffected by the War have been such as to demand more or lesscomplete reconstruction.   The nations in the east of Europeare either too disturbed or too new to afford as yet any useful example.   Of the rest Germany and Italy have actuallygiven, and Prance is proposing to give, direot representationof employees on the management.          Canada ha3 introduced a system which at first didnot Include employees on the management, but has already been compelled to give way.   The U.S.A. have kept the employeesout of management but have included them in the scheme for conciliation.   It may be mentioned that transport conditionsin the U.S.A. are still very disturbed.          The following is the position in the countries mentioned:                                                   In/
-    260           In Germany there is a Joint Industrial League for Transport whose functions include the organisation of railway workshops, railway administration and finance, and the re-organisation of the staff.   The main Committee comprises representatives of Government Departments, Trade Unions and technical and industrial associations.           In Italy the State Railways are governed by a Council of Railway  Administration under a Director-General.&apos; This consists of ten members (excluding the President), two of whom are railway officials.  The Government have agreed as a result of the strike in January, 1920, that 5 representatives elected by the staff shall be added to the Council and that the staff should  also be represented on the District Councils which operate under the General Council.           In France a Government Bill has  been introduced to place the hallways, ?/hich will continue under private management, under a Supreme Railway Council dealing with questions of general interest concerning the railways, on which it is provided that representatives of the employees shall sit.           In Canada, where all the railways except the Canadian Pacific have been nationalised, a&apos;Corporation has been established with a Board of Directors consisting of prominent business men who will possess substantially the same powers of management as the Board of an English Company, but it has been found necessary to promise that representatives of Labour shall be added.           In the United States a Railway Labour Board has been set up under the Transportation Act, 1920, composed                                                        /of
                                                    \.  261(Signed)  ERIC  GEDDES.% 1  DEC 19Mof nine members, three representing the public, threethe Companies, and three the employees and subordinateofficials.  The functions of the Board are to deal withthe relations between the Companies and their employees,particularly in relation to ;;ages, hours and working conditions; and it has power to order production of documents and sub-peena witnesses.          The general conclusion to be dra-ra at this stageis that where reconstruction has been attempted thetendency has undoubtedly been in the direction of givingLabour a position of greater responsibility, either in arranging the working conditions or in the actual manage-ment and cortrol of the railways, or in both.
