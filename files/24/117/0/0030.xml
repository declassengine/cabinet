Balfour*s interview with theJapanese Representative, reported in his telegram No. 50 ofDecember 9th,  (a copy of which is annexed) he had a furtherconversation with Viscount Ishii from which ho had gained theimpression that the real desire of the Japanese was not so muchto raise fundamental objections to the term of the Mandate,but rather to  discover some formula that would preserve theirdignity.&quot;      Later in the day His Excellency wrote Mr. Balfour the letterof which a copy Is enclosed, covering the draft of a declaration with he proposed to make.   It will be seen that he is preparedto accept the  &quot;C&quot; Mandate in its present form, provided suchacceptance is  not to be taken as an acquiescence in the submission of Japanese subjects to a discriminatory system of treatment in the mandated territories.      The Representative of Australia, with whom Mr. Balfour hasthroughout kept in close touch, saw no reason to object to theformula proposed by Viscount Ishii.   Senator Killen?s groat desire was to secure the assent to the Kandato of the Council of theLeague at the  earliest possible moment, and provided he receivedsatisfaction on this matter, he was quite prepared to agree to enterInto discussions with the Japanese Government on any points whichthey might from time to time&quot; desire to raise.   He disclaimeda*- the same time any intention to subject Japanese interests in new guinea to a worse treatment than that accorded to them in Australia,      At Mr. Balfour?s request, Viscount Ishii undertook to tele-graph to his Government to obtain their approval of the course proposed; at the same time, in view of the fact that the assembly would only be  In.session for a fow days longer and of the urgent necessity of losing no more time in settling this long outstandingquestion.  His Excellency agreed to Hr. Halfour1s suggestion to com-municate to the Council on December 14th the four British &quot;C&quot; Mandatesand expressed  the hope that ho would be able to deposit the JapaneseMandate before the end of the week.   Mr. Balfour accordingly commrav;icated to the  Council the four British     Mandates on December 14th.,                                      I am                                          Sir                                    Your obedient Servant,                                         (Sgd*)  GERALD SPICER,The Under Secretary of State         Foreign Office.
ENCLOSURE ICYPHER TELEGRAM:o:- Sir M. Hankeyrom:.- Mr. BalfourDosp. 4 p,m, 9th Deco1920*No. 58.     Yesterday at desire of Japanese Mr.Fisher and Itogether with Sir C Hurst had a long talk with Ishiiand Hayashi.     Conversation was of a very friendly character,and left me under the impression that the japanese would be disposed to v,raive their previous objectionsif they could receive an assurance that Japanese inter-ests and navigation in Now Guinea would not receiveworse treatment than they do in Australia.     Representative- of Australia here thought hisGovernment would be prepared to give such an under-taking and has telegraphed to his Government fortheir approval.

attack -EX TO LHCLOSURE II,         Draft Declaration relating to Mandate C;*     From the fundamental spirit of the &quot;League of Fiat ionsand as the question cf interpretation of the Govonant, theJapanese Government have a firm conviction in the justice of the claim they have hitherto made for the inclusion ofa clause concerning the assurance of equal opportunities for trade and commerce in Mandate C*   Put from the spiritof conciliation and co-operation and their reluctance tosee the question unsettled any longer, they have decidedto sign the Convention in its present form.   The signature,however, should not be ccn.3i0.ered as an acquiescence on thepart of the Japanese Government in the submission of japanese subjects tc a discriminatory and disadvantageoustreatment in the f-anFstsd Territories;  nor  have they thereindiscarded their claim that the rights and interests enjoyed by Japanese subjects in these Territories in the past shouldbe fully respected.
