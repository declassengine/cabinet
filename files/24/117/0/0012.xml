Before theWar, the Building Trades were especially subject to frequentand grave periods of unemployment) with all the attendanthardships upon the women and children particularly.Having regard, however, to the very serious arrears ofBuilding work throughout the country awaiting execution -arrears which must be made good  at the earliest practicalopportunity - and. the admitted shortage in the number of skilled men in the Building Trades compared with pre-war,the Government, while it appreciates this anxiety, cannot but come to the conclusion that  to-day it is entirelyunfounded.   Kevertheless, past  experiences, though nolonger applicable, are bound, to  weigh in men.Js minds.It would observe that an amended Unemployment InsuranceAct has been placed upon the Statute  Book this year,That Act provides a Benefit of 15/- a week which, if theTrade Union cares to become the  agency for administration,becomes 20/- a week by an additional contribution of5/r a week from Tre.de Union funds,                                         /Further                       (i)         :   &apos;   &quot;&quot;&apos;&quot;&apos;:
       further  under  Section  0  of the  Act,  the  employers and  Employed, in  any  industry can  got together  and devise a  Supplementary Schema of;  its own,    it  has he oil calculated  that  if the Kir.pl oyer 3  and Employed in this case each subscribe 6d*  a week or thereabouts  - additional  to  their  weekly contributions under  the State Scheme of  4&apos;d,  a week each  - a benefit of  30/-  &apos; a week would be  possible  (as against the 15/-  of the Act)-.   The Government are prepared to use  every effort with the  parties concerned in an  endeavour  to  bring them together  with  a  view to socuring  the establishment  cf such a Supplementary Scheme,  and  to such a  Supplementary Scheme would,  in consideration  of the  admission of 50,000 ex--Service men to  be trained in the  Industry, make.a     sp-s p. i *f,,,e cn t r i but ion,       The Government is of opinion that the absorption into the  Industry of a considerable numbor  of  ox-Service men  as adult Apprentices  or Trainees with a view to becoming skilled craftsmen, should  be commenced  forthwith,,   With regard to the  numbers to  be absorbed,  these should  be  on the basis of  one in  five calculated on the number  of skilled men in the whole industry,,   Variations of the  percentage  to be      allowed in  different trades; provided  always that the highest percent sires should be -applied to  the  three  branches of the&quot;rr Puairy  where the need was greatest,  namely,  &quot;^rick-layers, Slaters and Tilers,  and Plasterers; provided also that the minimum number of men thus admitted who will ultimately be corned, skilled  workmen in. the  industry shall  be Sat/ less then. 50,000*    rho proportions  to be  admitted  in the  various      above crafts/spec if led to bo arranged  with  the  llinister of  labour.
   (3)   The Government will arrange liberal ratea mf payment tothe skilled men who instruct the new entrants..   (4)   The Government accept the principle of a guaranteed rateof pay on housing operations for the time lost  owing to wet andinclement weather, subject to the Trade Unions  accepting the augmen-tation set out in paragraph 2;  and are prepared to provide forthe application on Housing Schemes of this principle on the following basis, viz          &quot;In the case of a man employed, or standing by to work           on a job when called upon, for a full week, the payment           for time lost through stress of weather shall be 50           per cent in iaspect of time lost up  to 22 hours per           weak.   In the case of time lost in  excess of 22 hours,           the hours lost over end above 22 hours shall be paid           for at the rate of 75 per cent of the time rate&quot;.   (5)   I s&amp;lill be glad if you will place this communicationbefore your Executive; and in view of the pressing urgency ofthe matter, the Government desires me to  ask for a reply by theend of the year.(Initialled)    T.J.M.December 17th. 1.920.
