\&quot;DRAFT LETTiSR TO EMPLOYERSi, i i i iBY3 , --v imont.-    329I236*&apos; ),JPRiSSIDSra OP BOARD OP ERitDB.     In view of the widespread depression of trade which prevails-at the ^resent time, the Government are-anxious that tho existingvolume of work should he shared as far as possible among thewhole body of the wage-earning classes.     In some industries the practice of working short time withthe object of providing employment for a larger number of people is well-established;  in others the nature of the industry maymake any such arrangement difficult;  but the Government feel that much can be d^ne by employers in general to alleviate distress bydistributing the existing opportunities for employment among as many as possible of their employees, so that the largest numbersmay be enabled to earn a portion of their tisual wages.     A system of short time may enable employers not only to spread their work for a longer time over the existing number oftheir employees but also to give employment to some who havealready been discharged.     The Government therefore ask that all employers should consider at onoe what re-arrangements can be made to give partialemployment to the maximum number of workpeople.   It will probablybe found in many oases that the cuestion can best be approachedin consultation with the Trades Union concerned, on whose co-operation the Government feel confident they can rely.     It is hoped that no time will be lost in taking thenecessary steps.   The Government have already planned to do all thatGovernment can do to provide in various ways for those who areout of work, but they look to employers and their workpeople todo what they can to keep the number of wholly unemployed as lowas possible.
