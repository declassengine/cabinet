28th December, 1920.

I submit for the consideration of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Irish Affairs my survey for the work ended the 27th instant.

GENERAL STATE OF THE COUNTRY.

Statistics of Outrages.

I am glad to state that the statistics of political crime have again fallen considerably. Only 36 outrages of a serious character were reported for the week ended the 25th instant - a decrease of nearly 40% below the total for the previous week. The improvement is reflected in a very welcome decrease in the number of casualties inflicted upon the Crown Forces, which foll from 26 to 10. The latter figure included 1 case of murder (a police constable) and 9 cases of wounding (6 police and 3 military). In addition to these casulaties one policeman was killed and one policeman and one soldier were wound? in an unfortunate encounter which took place in Ahenure District County Kilkenny on the 20th instant when a police car was fired upon by mistake by a party of soldiers who had a few hours previously been ambushed in the vicinity by a body of Sinn Foin raidors.

One vacated Police Barrack (Ballinamult, Cappoquin District, County Waterford) was destroyed during the week but no attacks were made on occupied barracks.

Two civilian deaths due to Sinn Fein outrages were reported. In o? of those cases, which occured at Carrick-on-Barrow, County Wexford on the 20th instant, the vicitim appears to have been murdered on account of his friendly relations with the police. The other case we? that of a man who was killed, perhaps accidentally.

on the 23rd ins tent by a-party of Sinn Fein Volunteers who were engaged in raiding houses  in Pcmeroy district, County Tyrone,  forpoteen.     Raids on nails fell from 30 to 17 and only one case of a raidfor arms was reported,     Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered. 61, a3light decrease an compared with the figures  (66) for the previousweek.Trials C/f .0iviliana, by Court Martial,     Fifty-three trials of civilian? by Court Martial took place during the w-^ek and resulted in forty-eight convictions and fiveacquittals,   Scntencdof five years&apos; penal servitude was imposed in four cases for the possession of soft-nosed ammunition and sentence of 3 years&apos; penal servitude in another case,,   Imprisonment with hardlabour for periods varying from 2 years to 1 month was Imposed intwenty-four cases and imprisonment without hard labour for periodsup to a maximum of twelve months in nine cases.   In two cases the sentences  (Imprisonment with hard labour) were remitted by theConfirming Officer,     Of the above  convictions forty were cases of political offences (possession of arms,  seditious literature etc, )  and eight  cases  of ordinary  crime.   The latter  included the casebf a motor  driverattached  to the Auxiliary Division HI.C, who  was found  in possessionof a  quantity  of  silver articles for  which he failed  satisfactorilyto account and was  sentenced  to  two months  Imprisonment  with hard labour, and will,  of  course,  be  dismissed  from the Forco. Internment Orders Ti   &apos;   Orders for  internment  were  made  In 7  cases  during the week,STATE OF TM  POLIO71 FORCES,      The  week^s  recruiting  for  the  Royal  Irish Constabulary  has  again been highly satisfactory  and  has resulted  In  a not increase  of 115 to the  strength of  the Regular Force,  and of  40  to that of the  Auxiliary Division,,   The  following are the  usual particulars  of wastage and recruitment

 RESUMPTION  OF  RAILWAY  SERVICES.r     Tho  general return  to  work of  the  railwapnon  who have been suspended from duty  in consequence  of the munitions  strike takes place to-day and the Railway  Companies  are  anxious to restore their normal services  at the  earliest possible dat*.,    On the Midland Great  Western  Railway the immediate  re-instatement ot the  whole of the suspended  staff is considered by  the Management to be impracticable  owing to  the fact that  a large number of the engines are In need  of repairs which cannot  be executed while  the boilermakcrs strike  continues and the question has arisen whether the  Company are justified under the Settlement Agreement in restricting reinstatement  to.the number of  men  for  whom work  is available.   Pending decision on this point  by the Ministry of Transport the  National Union  of Railwayman  havo  issued  Instructions forbidding any of  the  suspended employees on this  line  to resume work.  A difficulty of  another character has  arisen on the Great Northern  Railway owing to the imposition by  the  Company of the condition that their suspended employees shall -. ake  a written application for re-instatement.  This requirement  has net been-imposed on the -other lines  and is regarded by the  men as a breach of the general conditions of  settlement.  On the Great  Southern and  &apos;,restern Railway  and  the Dublin  and  South Eastern Railway it Is expected that a return to  the full normal services will be  made within.a  few days. PRESENT STATE  OF ?political  OPINION  IN IRELAND.      Discussion as to  the immediate practicability of a negotiated settlement between the Government ani the Sinn Fein  leaders continues to hold  the  foremost place in the  Irish  Press and I  am glad to note the steady  growth of a more reasonable  and conciliatory tone  in the  leading southern newspapers..   The recent letters of the  Archbishop of  Tuam and the Bishop cf  .Kilmor-e condemning police  murders and ambushes  and pointing  out that                                                            armed/
armed resistance offered without ftiry p*oepect of auccesw againstthe constituted authority of the country ie both an evil In itself and productive of other evils In its train have been given thegreaiset prominence in papers like the Freeman1a Journal and theIrish Independent and are bound to have an important influenceupon public opinion.  It Is significant that a paper mith sucha continuous record of nationalism as the Cork Examiner Hari founditself the victim of an attack by Republican incendiaries,   a determined attempt with bombs and other explosives was made onthe 24th Instant to wreck the printing plant of this newspaper,apparently on account of its having given its approval to the bishop of Cork1s declaration against police murders, and it isan encouraging sign that this outrage only resulted in elicitingfrom this leading organ of southern IMsh opinion the followingstriking condemnation of revolutionary violence.     &quot;The case supplies an example&apos;of the amount of mischief a fewyoung men in the possession of revolvers and explosives canaccomplish.  Their powers for destruction are unquestionably great.What they can accomplish that would be useful for the country hasvet to be seen.&quot;                                      (Initialled)-5-IRISE OFFICE.
