                                                AJ  0 This Document  is  the  Pioporty of^His  Brii.af.mc lVIale3ty&apos;s:GoVernment,(P 8764)       From Secretary of State to  Viceroy,  Foreign Department,                              29$ December 1920.    &apos; Clear the line.     4327.  Private.  My official telegram  of  19th December, 4152.  Afghanistan.  Ihave submitted question&apos; of Amir&apos;s  title to His  Majesty  the King as proposed.Following is His Majesty&apos;s reply     &quot; King still dislikes idea of granting  title  at  all, but if  Amir concludes treaty,which is in our opinion entirely satisfactory, then and then  only would His  Majestyapprove of reversion of title enjoyed by Amjr&apos;s father.  Meanwhile King cannot agreeto bestowal  of title  being used as something  to  bargain  with in  negotiating treaty.It ought to be reserved as reward for practical proof of bona fides  and friendship ofAmir as evinced in a treaty acceptable to British  Government.&quot;     Please instruct  Dobbs accordingly.  While paying strict  regard to His Majesty&apos;swishes,. I do not think he  need  feel  himself precluded from letting Amir  knowprivately  and unofficially that conclusion  of  really satisfactory treaty  is likely to befollowed at once by  resumption  by His Majesty&apos;s Government of style used by themin addressing his predecessor.
