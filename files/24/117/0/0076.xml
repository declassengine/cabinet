This  document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,382SECRET.CP. 2376.the  CABINET.THE  DISARMAMENT  OF  GERMANY.          MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR WAR.    I circulate the following Memorandum  which has been prepared by the GeneralStaff, together with an interesting despatch by Lord d&apos;Abernon.                                                                     w. s. c.  WAR OFFICE,      2Uh December, 1920.    1. The political aspect of this question has been admirably dealt with in a despatch   0154by Lord d&apos;Abernon, dated the 23rd November, 1920, a copy of which is given below as   5531Appendix A.    It is considered  that  Lord  d&apos;Abernon&apos;s views are sound and correct in every respect, and that the question should be treated on the lines proposed by him.    2. From a military point of view, the disarmament  of Germany  has  been  carriedsufficiently far to prevent any fear of an organized aggressive military operation on herpart in the  near  future.  In Paris, at the Peace Conference, nearly two years ago, theGeneral Staff expressed the opinion that, provided Germany were disarmed to  such a degree as to render her incapable of aggression, she should be left with  sufficient forces to maintain  internal order and a stable Government.  At that time  the General Staffconsidered that the reduction of the German military forces should take place gradually,though well  within the margin of safety.   Mainly owing to French opposition, these views were only partially accepted, but their soundness has been borne out by the factthat it has been found necessary to postpone the reduction  of the  German Army to100,000 until the 1st January, 1921, i.e., nearly 18  months after  the signature of theTreaty of Versailles, and to  increase the strength of the German police forces by about70,000 men.     The General Staff has  always regarded the  effective disarmament  of  Germany,and the destruction of  all surplus war material, as the main essential in  renderingGermany incapable of further  aggressive action  against the Allies, as opposed to thereduction of the German  standing Army.  For years to  come Germany  will havemillions  of trained  men  at her disposal,  but  cannot  form an army of these unlessshe possesses the necessary  war  material.     3. At  the present  time the German Government  has complied with  its Spaundertaking  to reduce the Regular Army to 100,000  men  by the  1st January, 1921.At least, orders to that effect have been issued, and there is good reason to believe thatthey will be carried out in all essentials, though some details  may not be found whollysatisfactory.  Similarly, the abolition of the Sicherheitspolizei has been decreed  and the transformation of this force  into Ordnungspolizei is in full swing.     Little fault can, therefore, be found with the German Government  on these points.     4. In other important  matters, such  as  the  law for the abolition of compulsory military service,  some pressure  has had  to be  put on the German  Government to compel them to frame their laws in a wholly satisfactory manner, devoid of ambiguity.     In the opinion of the General Staff, the terms of Article 172 (disclosure of chemicalsecrets) have not been fully carried out, but the policy of the British Government inthis important question has not yet been finally decided.   General Nollet has  actuallyreported the complete execution of this Article.     (B20/521)  200 12/20  H&amp;S,Ltd. 8835wo
     5. The destruction of guns  and  war  material  of  every description has  made considerable progress in the last 6 months, and, although  much remains to be done, thework has proceeded sufficiently far to render Germany  incapable of carrying on an offensive campaign against the Allies for some time to come.  It is considered  that theGerman Government has shown good faith in its method of dealing with this extremely important matter, and the surrender and destruction of arms, ammunition, and all kinds of war  material have  been speeded  up in a highly satisfactory way since  the SpaConference last July.     6. There  remains  the question of the  Einwohnerwehren,  Orgesch  and similarformations.     The General Staff  has always been strongly opposed  to the existence  of such semi-official organizations, not on account of any present danger to be apprehended from such bodies, but because they might form  the  basis of a  great  future national army.  Itis  of supreme  importance  to  prevent Germany  from repeating Prussia&apos;s tactics of1806-1813.     Germany&apos;s regular  armed forces  have been reduced to a  very low figure, 100,000men for a population of some 65 millions.   Austria  is allowed 30,000 for 6^ millions,and  Hungary 35,000 for some  8 millions.   On  these  lines,  Germany should have  a regular Army of approximately 300,000 men.     In  view  of the  Bolshevik  menace  on  Germany&apos;s eastern frontier,  and  theCommunist  agitation   in  the country,  especially  in   North  Germany,  it is  notunnatural that  the loyal  and law-abiding  majority of the  German people  shoulddesire to  guarantee their security by banding themselves together in local defensiveorganizations, to make  up for the weakness of the Army, and  to meet the real dangerof anarchy and  Bolshevism.   Nor is  it unnatural that the anxiety to maintain  suchorganizations, and  to give them adequate arms, e.g., a proportion of rifles and machine guns, should be strongest in  East Prussia, which is  nearest to Soviet  Russia, and inBavaria, which has experienced some of the horrors of Bolshevism.     7. In the opinion  of the  General Staff, the year 1921 will prove an  exceptionallycritical period in the history of Europe.  The possibilities of Bolshevist attacks, eitheragainst Poland and Rumania, or against both  States,  the desparate economic  positionand  possible collapse of Austria, and the social and economic position of Europe, and ofthe world in general, must be borne in mind.     There is no doubt  that Bolshevism, and not Germany, is at  present  the danger tothe  peace of Europe.   The Germans have  not the  artillery,  aeroplanes, submarines,munitions, transport, money,  nor have they the  will to resume military operations against the Allies for some time to come.     A stable Germany  is essential to the peace of Europe, and it must  be recognizedthat the Einwohnerwehren  and   Orgesch  constitute a strong force on the side of lawand  order.     8. Although these  organizations present no immediate  danger, and although theirpresent object is the preservation  of law and order in Germany, the General Staff havenot  changed their  opinion as to  the  necessity for  the  ultimate suppression  of theseorganizations.  If  allowed to continue indefinitely,  they will become a military danger,by forming the basis of a National Army, and by constituting  an aid to possible futuremobilization.     A time limit must, therefore, be fixed for their disarmament and disbandment.     9. The General  Staff  are   in  entire  agreement   with  Lord  d&apos;Abernon  (videparagraph 1 and  penultimate paragraph  of his  despatch) that it would be unwise to press the question of the disarmament of the civil population in too  peremptory a manner,  and that  we  should give time for the German Government to  exercise its influence on the Bavarians and East Prussians, which it is quite willing to do.     10.  As regards the disbandment of the  Orgesch  and Einwohnerwehr, the GeneralStaff strongly favour a solution on the lines suggested  in  former  reports from bothLord d&apos;Abernon and General Malcolm, Le.,  decentralization and gradual reduction, theforce to be placed under the recognized civil authorities instead of being, as is at presentthe case with the Orgesch, a more or less private concern.     11.  As regards the occupation of the Ruhr, the General  Staff  are in  complete agreement with the views  expressed  by  Lord  d&apos;Abernon  in paragraph  3 of his despatch.

APPENDIX A.            ^Lord d&apos;abernon to Earl Curzon. (Received 26th November.)o:(No. 1187.) My Lord,                                           Berlin, 2$rd November, 1920.      IT may  be of interest to your Lordship if I  state succinctly my views on the principal questions, having a military hearing which  are now under discussion.      The presence here of Generals Bingham and Malcolm, both of whom have shown unusual ability and judgment  in the discharge of their several functions, enables me to speak on these matters after hearing competent military advice.      The principal  questions are :           (1.)  The further prosecution of disarmament.          (2.)  The disbandment of the Einwohnerwehr.          (3.)  Occupation of the Ruhr.      With regard to these questions :  1. As to Disarmament.      I think it essential to push on with the utmost energy the destruction of the larger war material, including aeroplanes, submarines, guns, minenwerfer, &amp;c.      I  consider the confiscation of rifles and small  arms as belonging to a totally different category.   Without  in any way abandoning the demand for the surrender of these,  I should advise a somewhat less  energetic  and categorical  attitude than  as respects larger material.  Although Dr. Peters says that he  can get hold of large quantities of rifles now in the hands of Communists and their friends, I rather doubt whether this is so in fact,  and I should fear to disarm  the orderly sections  of the population, leaving arms in the hands of the extreme Socialists and Spartacists. 2. As regards the  Disbandment of the Einwohnerwehr and the Orgesch.      It is difficult to decide whether these organizations make rather for order or for future trouble.  They are at  bottom monarchical and military, although they deny it, since there is  no  question that the large majority of the members of these forces, and certainly the whole of the  officers,  belong  to one or other of  the parties of the Right. Whether they would assist a new &quot; Putsch &quot; or not may be  doubtful: there would probably be a  different result  in different parts of the country.   On the other hand, in the  event of further successes by the Russian Soviet, which would undoubtedly lead to a new outbreak of communism in Germany, it can be regarded as certain  that both the Einwohnerwehr and  the Orgesch would  powerfully serve  the cause  of order.   In my judgment the  danger from  the Left  far  exceeds the  danger from  the  Right, and I should be inclined to risk whatever  danger there  may be of the Einwohnerwehr and Orgesch giving  undue  assistance  to  a reactionary outbreak, which  would  hardly threaten any permanent  danger, in order  to  have their support of the cause of order in the  more  probable event of a communistic outbreak   This danger, in the opinion of the military officers and in mine, will be largely dependent  upon events in  Russia and Poland.      It does not appear  to me that any violent decision or decisive action on our part is required for the moment.   The German Government are reported to be negotiating with the Bavarian Government in favour of the partial disarmament of the Einwolmer- wehr and in favour of a reduction of their numbers.   We can afford to await the result of these negotiations. 3.  With regard to the Occupation of the Ruhr.      All the evidence I receive goes to prove that the occupation of the Ruhr would  be regarded by all parties in Germany as an act of violence dictated by the desire to break up Germany.  Grave labour  troubles would probably ensue,  and the orderly progress of  the process of restoration in  Germany would  be violently disturbed.  On these grounds, therefore, I am strongly against the Ruhr occupation, or of creating any situation which would lead to  or justify it.      There is a further reason  against it, namely, that if carried out our most powerful means of compulsion on Germany would cease to exist.  The menace of the occupation
of the Ruhr  undoubtedly  keeps the  German  Government up  to the mark.   Onceexecuted, this means of pressure would not  exist, and we should be embarrassed toknow what to substitute.     I have discussed these questions  with  Generals Bingham and Malbolm, whose views do not widely differ from those expressed above.   The Commission of  Control,as such, are bound  to ask for  the disarmament  of the Einwohnerwehr, but it is quiteopen to them not  to press it  in too peremptory a manner, and to  give time for theGerman Government to exercise its influence on the Bavarians.     There can be little doubt that at one time some French agents rather encouraged the Bavarians to maintain and develop the  Einwohnerwehr, but that was  at a  timewhen they  thought Bavaria would  separate from the Reich.  Now  the same agentshave swung round and are among the loudest  in demanding  prompt and categoricalaction.                                                       I have, &amp;c.D&apos;ABERNON.
