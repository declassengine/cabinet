Ministry of Health,     Thitohall,. wS  .1.      December, 11)20.Sir,          I am directed by the Minister of Health to statethat the Minister has remitted for the consideration ofHis Iviajesty&apos;s Government questions arising in connection withthe relief now being given in certain poor law unions to personsin distress through want of employment/ and to acquaint you forthe information of the Guardians vvith the conclusions reached by His Majesty5h Government.  1          In certain Unions the Guardians have adopted a policyof affording outdoor relief in money or in kind without attach-ing any conditions to the grant.          It is recognised that the Guardians have been ledto adopt this policy by a natural sympathy with the needs ofthose suffering from.the unemployment&apos; at present, prevailing.At the same time it is felt that the Guardians must now beasked carefully to consider seme of the consequences of thepolicy;, and this is the more necessary as the number of applicants for relief in the unions where this policy obtainstends to increase rapidly.          In the first place there is a risk that this reliefwill be r;iven to men who are not entitled to the sameconsideration as the bona fide  u&amp;wiiployed workman.          In&apos;the second place the expenditure of the Guardians -will probably before long be in excess of the rate ofexpenditure upon which their estimates for the current half-yearhave been based, and the Guardians will be compelled toprovide additional funds if their present course of action isto continue&apos;.
          I am therefore directed to point out that article? of the Relief Regulation Order, 1911 does not authoriseany  wholesale granting of outdoor relief tout requires theGuardians to give special consideration to each case in whichit is proposed to grant outdoor relief (or otherwise to depart from the provisions of the earlier articles) andauthorises then;, only if they find special circumstancespresent in that case, to grant the proposed relief,.reporting their action in due course to the minister.          It is therefore incumbent upon the Guardians toexamine each Individual case and&apos; for the purpose of suchan examination it may be necessary for the Guardians tostrengthen the staff employed and the Minister will give any necessary sanction to the engagement, of such additional staff as may be required.          This discrimination is especially necessary atthe present time in view of the continuation of theunemployment donation for ex-service men until March, of theabolition of the waiting period for new entrants under the.Unemployment Act and of the other special measures taken .by the Government for the relief of unemployment.          As regards the second point suggestions have, beenmade that, grants should be, given from the Exchequer to ..relieve the local ratepayers of all -or part of the burdenof poor relief provided by the Guardians.          The proposals of the Government Here announced in the House of Commons on Tuesday last, and include a verylarge provision for  the assistance of the local rates wherework, is provided by Local Authorities,, and the Government
have instructed the Minister to intimate to the Guardiansconcerned that assistance fro:?; the. Exchequer is not in any circumstances to be expected by them                   I am, Sir,                       Your obedient Servant.,The Clerk to the Guardians.
