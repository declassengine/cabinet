Looal oenditione vary in each case, but tho measures taken in           any area react on our imperial military organisation as a whole.           It is therefore only  just that seme distribution of the military           burden should be contemplated which would avoid the strain of           exceptional military measures required in any one  locality           falling solely on that locality or, in default, on the  United           Kin&amp;om tr  India.                                       i           8V    The importance  of the  question has boon accentuated &quot;by  the           possibility that in  the near  future the Government of  India  may           be unwilling  or unable to provide  troops for service  outside           India, on  the same  scale  as hitherto,  This possibility has           compelled  consideration  of  the question as  to whether  efficient           substitutes can be  found  which will enable  us to replacet  or   ^       partially  replace,  Indian troops by native  troops  from other           parts of the  Empire;  and  in choosing  such substitutes  it  is                                                                   well
well to bear in mind that in tho use of native troops generallythere is safety in a variety of race, creed, and location whichpermits of interchangoability if require-4*   As a result of the war we have consolidated ear positionin Africa, and now control a comparatively largo native population containing a considerable proportion of first-classfighting materials  Steps are being taken to investigate thoseresources3 tho magnitude and availability of which wo have notyet boon fully determined, although it is clear that they are greatly superior to any at our disposal elsewhere in the Bast*   It is therefore to Africa that we must loch in the firstplace for any considerable relief of that portion of themilitary burden imposed &quot;by acceptance of the various Easternmandates j. which. India may not bo able to bear,.3o   W-3 may now review the general military question of theEastern mandates in the light of the foregoing considerations.-,   As regards the rAT mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamiaour freedom of action has been partially secured by savingclauses which would permit,  subject to the consent of theLocal Government, the external use cf troops raised withinthose mandatory territories^  The French, in their rATmandate for Syria, hayo not included any such saving clause^Tho reasons for this may possibly bo that thoy are of opinioneither, that all troops raised in Syria are likely to he required locally for some time to come, or that the potentialvalue of the Syrian as a soldier is not groats   The case is entirely different when we come tc considertho rB* mandates for African territories,,  Here the Pronehhave refused to be bound in their mandates by conditionslimiting the external use of troops raised in mandatoryterritories, while we apparently have been willing to accept3uch cenditinns.  The French are aware of tho potential value                                                           of  /
                                                             Sic-f these African troops,  of tho comparative immunity and peace of the territories in which they will be raised, and of thegnat assistance the;y can render in more disturbed areaselsewhere.  It is evident also that the French realise thatfreedom of action as regards erturual use of such troops mayconfer other military advantages,  according to &quot;the geographical position of the mandatory territory, while the lack of suchfreedom may for the same  reason entail considerable dis-advantages,,  i^or instance,  tic troops raised in the C...- icroonswill add greatly to French strength in &apos; est ^frica, alreadyso much superior to our o\*n.  On the other hand, inabilityon our part to raise troops in German  hast Africa exceptfor internal purposes,  would cripple at the outset anyserious endeavour to utilise the native man-power resourcesof Eastern Africa either for the defence of any of ourpossessions in the African Continent, or for the defenceof any mandatory area elscohere, or for relieving the general military burden of the United Kingdom or India4  Theimportance of our being in a position to utilise this man-power has  been emphasised in paragraph 2 above,4,   ifrcm every military point of view we are therefore forcedto the conclusion that our interests will suffer if we areunwise enough to accept mandates under Halting militaryconditions whose effect may not have been fully appreciated,-itill more are we likely to suffer,  in a military sense, ifthese limiting condition/ are t* apply only to  ourselves and not to o tners.     For these reasons the Ceaeral  Staff are of opinion that     (a) Ho clause should be inserted in any mandate which         would preclude entirely the external use of troops!         raised within mandatory territory.                                              (I)  There
(b) There should under no eiroumetanoes be any    discrimination against this country in respeot to    the  nature of mandates granted to different nations,    st far as military considerations are concerned-                         (Intd.)
