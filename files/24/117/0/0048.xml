 This Document is the Property of                      j () ()His Britannic Majesiya Covsmment.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.     RET.   CP.  2348^/fyy,       - K^^W Percy  Cox. lias now answered  our  last telegram, and  it is obviousS^JS5J.&quot;Ak^lfeix the proposal put forward  by the  Secretary of  State  for War is neither            consistent with  our policy  nor  immediately practicable, in  the opinion of            Sir Percy Cox and  apparently of General Haldane.  I have  always feared            that this would  be the case.  Our only right in Mesopotamia is to form an            Arab Government in substitution for the Turkish Government we destroyed,            and this cannot be done from  Basra.  In fact, the  only possible alternatives            in Mesopotainian policy are, to my mind, to do our job or to clear out.                 It seems to me, therefore, that we  ought now  to take the decision that            a Middle East Department should  at  once be formed  to  take over  the            administration, civil and military, of  Palestine, Egypt and Mesopotamia, and            of our affairs in the Middle East generally, including the Persian Gulf, Aden,            and Arabia,  if not Persia itself, and that this Middle East  Department should            recruit its own forces for  these territories either from native  levies or from            India, if  it cannot  get native  levies.   It  is  my  view  that, although  the             difficulties of obtaining large numbers of Indian  troops remain  great,  one            could recruit  Indians  to a Middle East  army.  But I should hope that  the            countries would find their own armies in a very short time.                 The only obstacle to this policy  is that  the  Government has not  yet             decided  upon which department should be the Middle East  Department,            although it  appears that they have  definitely decided it  must not be a new             department.   It would appear that we have always shied off  the decision as            to  which department it should be as though it were  a matter of  extreme             difficulty.  It really is not.  It could only take an hour to decide at the very             most.  It need only really take live minutes, by asking  each  Member of the             Cabinet their view and if necessary taking a majority vote.  We are pledged            up to the hilt, and  over  the hilt, against the  continuation  of  the  existing             arrangement.   It is two years since I urged  that the India Office was not the             right place from which the control of any part  of the Middle  East should be             attempted.  A definite pledge was given to Sir Percy Cox before he went out             that a Middle East Department  should  be established.   The  present system             is  unfair to the India  Office, unfair to India, and unfair  to Mesopotamia.             For the sake of economy and for the  sake of our reputation, I  would ask that             this matter should be settled, before  we adjourn for the holidays, and I             believe that the best course would probably be to transfer Mesopotamia to the             Foreign  Office which already is  looking after Palestine, Egypt, Arabia  and             Persia.                 I had  originally thought  that the  Colonial  Office would be better;             but, on  the  advice  of Sir  Percy Cox, I am  anxious to avoid taking  any             steps  which  would  look like  the  annexation to the   British Empire of             mandated  territory.   Unless, therefore,  my colleagues see  any objection,             I would  propose to hand over my Mesopotamian department to the  Foreign             Office as soon as may be.                                                                         E. S. M.                 22nd December 1920.2997    100  12.20
    I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet at once the Report of Lord Mil norand his colleagues on Egypt.    Lord  Milner  is  anxious that  it  should  be considered  at  a very early date.   1 concur.                                                     .   C.  OF K.    Foreign Office,          December &apos;23, 1920.
