[IS DOCUMENT IS TE3 PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJE8TYrS GOVERNMENT).1-S3Q1.           REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE EMPLOYMENT 0*  WOMEN in memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     I attach a  copy  of regulations governing the employment of women which it  is  proposed  to  lay before the House in accordance with  an undertaking given at  the time when the Sex Disqualification  Bill was  under discussion.     These regulations relate  to  the recruitment of women to three classes :-&apos;   (a) The Junior  or  Cadet Corps  of the  Administrative Glass (old Class I).   (b) Situations not being in the Administrative Class but superior to those  of  the Junior Grade of the Clerical Class.   (o) Situations  in  the J&apos;tmior Grade of the Clerical. Class.     They provide also that all women candidates for established situations in the Civil Service shall be unmarried or widows, and that the wonen appointed to or holding any established position in the Civil Service  shall be required to resign their appointments on marriage; provided only that exceptions may be made to either of these rules on  the recommendation of the Head of the Department if  the Civil  Service Commissioners and the Treasury (in  the case  of recruitment), and the Treasury (in the case of a woman already holding  an established. position) are satisfied that it is in the interests.of the Public Service that such exceptions should be made.     The regulations relating  to the recruitment ofwomen to the reorganised Civil Service fellow the recommond- ations of the Reorganisation Committee of the NationalC A B I N E T.THIS  CIVIL  SERVICE,
Whitley Council, which hare been approved by HisMajestyrs Governments   I attach as an Appendix to this note, an extract from the Report of the ReorganisationCommittee on this subject.  I should also add that on the17th June, 1920, the Prime Minister informed the House inreply to a question that steps were being taken to giveeffect to the reo commendations of the ReorganisationCommittee; that pending further experience His Majesty&quot;sGovernment die. not fool justified in varying them; thatin the nature of things these recommendations ccrld onlybe tentative and that.the Government were prepared to review the situation afresh within a reasonable periodof time, which in no ease would exceed five years andmight be considerably less.     k promise has been given that the House shall&apos;have the earliest possible opportunity of discussing these -regulations, and it is therefore necessary that they shouldbe laid at a very early date.     Discussion in the House will probably turn on four main points     (l)  The proposal to exclude married women fromEstablished postsa     (2)  Equal pay for men and women.     (3)  The method of recruitment of women.     (4)  Postponement of the claims of women to those ofthe Ex-Service man.Married Women.  As regards (1)*  The argument for excludingmarried women is twofold     fa)  The general trend of social reform is against thepractise if married women going out to work.     (b)  The efficient administration of Government service would be jeopardised if there were no &quot;bar to the employment o
TnarrlGci wmsm  The work of Departments cannot &quot;be efficiently carried on by officers who do not render continuous service. And whilst in theory it might be possible to regulatei the employment of married women in the Civil Service as an alternative to their complete exclusion, it becomes obvious on-reflection that in practice no such regulation would be possible, Equal 3pgye  The regulations now to be laid do&apos;not prescribe rates of pay, but the House has already learned from the terms of the Reorganisation CommitteeTs Report what are the approved rates for the common Classes included in the reference of the Reorganisation Committee, and will presrmably be allowed to raise the question of equal pay in the coarse of discussion of the regulationse  The answer to this claim is that the rates for men in the Civil Service have been fixed, as undoubtedly they have been fixed outside the Civil Service, with reference to the normal needs of married persons; that the majority of women are not responsible for the support of dependents; that the cost of prescribing equal rates for men and women would run into many millions of pounds per annum for the Civil Service alone and would not stop there;  and that inevitably if women&quot;were given menxs rates cf pay,  we should be merely starting a  new and most serious demand from married men, both inside and  outside the Civil Service,  to be given on top of what is now the men&apos;s rate of pay an  extra allowance equivalent to the extra burden cf the  responsibilities of marriage^ I  should,  however,  be disposed  to tell the House  that His Majesty:s  Government  offer  no obstacle  to further discussion of the question in three  years1  time,  if that were  desiredoMethod of  Reoruitmonta      My colleagues  are  already aware  of the  strong demand which  is  made  from certain quarters  for  complete equality as between men and women,  and  that  this  demand                                                  covers
covers not merely pay but the method of recruitment0I think that at this stage we should bo ill-advised to concede the claim for open competitive examinationsat which men and women would be equally eligible tocompste.  So far as the higher branches of the Civil  service are concerned it seems to me clear that at this stagebetter women candidates would bo secured to the CivilSorvico by a system of selection with a qualifying written examiniation than by the test of an open competitive written examiniation:,  But hero again I should be disposed to  give an undertaking to the House that the method of recruitmentproposed in the regulations  (which incidentally is a  limitedcompetition confined at the outset to women who have  already -served under Government) should be reviewed in three  years1time eThe Ex-Service Man0      The  other important question which is likely to beraised is how far the claims of women to extended employmentin the Civil Service are to be subordinated to the claims ofthe ex-service man.  On this question I should observe that lord  Iiytton*s Committee has already issued an interim Reportcovering tho question of the employment of ex-Service men inthe Civil Service in a temporary capacity, and that it isnow considering to what extent priority  of consideration should.be given to the claims of  ex-Service men to be appointed to theCivil Service in permanent posts.  Pending this report no finaldecision can well be given as te the extent ta which provisioncan be made for the employment of women in permanent posts; butwe should at this stage make it clear to the House that whilst EMajesty1s Government intend  that preference shall  continue tobe given to ex-Soldiers9 that preference will operate to the    :disadvantage of women and non-service men alike.      I have carefully considered the draft regulations and am satisfied that the policy to which they give expression&apos;                           - 4 -                    should

APPENDIX TO C.P.J2501.13 fcSTKACT y-OK THE REPORT OF Till: REQhGANISATION COMMITTEE. TIB RBCRUITMKNT AN&apos;) STATUS OF VJOMEW IN THE CIVIL SERVICE^,      8. In considering the question of the  employment  of women in the Civil Service,  it must be noted that  Parliament has laid down the  principle  that  a person shall  not  be disqualified on grounds of sex from the exercise of  any public function.    ue  appreciate  that  it is  not  possible  at this stage to attempt  a final solution of the  novel  and complex problems involved  in the  employment  of women,  side by side with men,  throughout the  several classes of  a graded service  of  the  Crown.    V?o are  by common  consent breaking new ground.    But it has been .our earnest endeavour, while  realising that wo are  working in a field of strictly limited experience, to ensure that the opportunities afforded to women of proving their  fitness to discharge the higher administrative  duties  of the  Civil Service shall be  full and liberal.     9.   In the application  of  this principle  we were met at the outset with the claim,- which has the  support  of  a number of  members of the Committee, that in  recruitment, status,  pay and general conditions  of  service, there should be no  differentiation  between the sexes.   In  the direction of meeting U-.is claim,  we  are agreed that within the parallel classes  of the  Civil Service  women  should be given a status and authority identical with  that accorded to men.   Further, whilst we  propose that  during the experimental period there should be  separate Establishments Lists  for men  and for women within each  class of the Civil Service, and that promotion for -nen and  for women  should eroceed separately  as vacancies occur  in the higher establishment reserved for either sex,we  are of  opinion that  the principles of training and of promotion  that we have  recommended for men should be appliedequally to the parallel women classes,  and that  it should be                                                            the
the duty of Department a, under the general guidance of the I? stab-lishments Department of the Treasury, to see to it that women are regarded as available for employment on the samo work as menwithin the several classes, and that women&apos;are given the widestopportunities of proving their administrative capacity.   vjhetherthe Interests of efficiency will best be served by segregationor by the employment of women and men side by side, is amatter on which experience varies; and we suggest that therequirements of departmento in this respect night appropriatelyhe discussed at the Department Councils.   It may fairly be argued that, in order to obtain the full value of the experiment,every opportunity should be given for men and women to workside by side,     10.   As regards pay, we are agreed that the minimum ofthe basic scale in each class should bo the same for women as for men; ami that the incremental rates should be Identicalup to a points     11.  &apos;&amp;e are agreed that, in the case of the Clerical Class,we are no longer in the experimental sphere.   Experience has established that women are fully capable of discharging the clerical work of the Civil Service; and we recommend that women should be recruited to the Clerical Class proposed by us by the method of open competition by written examination.   Thehigher examination age limit required for girls (15-J- - 17-1)as compared with boys, together with the need for a separateseniority list, makes it necessary that young women who are candidates for entry to this class should be recruited by a separateexamination, though the subject-matter of the examination shouldbe of the same standard as that prescribed for male candidates.     12,   with regard, however, to the recruitment of theAdministrative and Executive Classes, hereafter proposed, theOfficial Side, while desiring to retain for men the method of                                                             open
open competition by written examination,  advocatesin the case of women, at the present stage;  a  systemof selection by impartial and, authoritative  Boards.The Staff Side attaches great importance  to  theprinciple of recruitment by open,  competitive,written examination, and it is prepared to assent to selection by Boards only on the condition that thequestion of recruitment will be reviewed  by  the  national council within a period of five years.&apos;0

 C. Temporary Regulations for a Competitive Examination governing  thb         Appointment of Women  to Situations  in the Clerical Class.     1. Candidates must be not less  than  18 years of age on the first day of July 1920.A candidate born on 1st July 1902 would be admitted.     No exception on any grounds will be made to this rule.     2. No candidate will be eligible who has  not rendered one full year&apos;s approvedservice prior to the  1st July 1920, in one or more of the  following  capacities: In atemporary clerical post in a Government  Department, or  in a temporory clerical  postin  the War  Department Establishments,  or  in  National  Factories, Stores, Bonds,Dep6fcs, &amp;c, where the services were remunerated direct from public funds; or as  anenrolled member in the clerical sections of Queen Mary&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps, theWomen&apos;s  Royal Naval Service, the  Women&apos;s Royal Air Force, or the Voluntary AidDetachments General  Service.     3. Candidates will be required to satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners-           (a) That they are unmarried or widows ;           (/;) That they are duly  qualified in respect of health and character.     No person will  be  eligible who is  not a natural-born British subject, and thedaughter of a father also a natural-born British subject.     4. The examination will be in the following subjects,&quot; viz. :-        ,   1.  English Composition (including Spelling).           2.  Handwriting.           3.  Precis-writing.           L  Arithmetic.           5.  General Paper.     5. Candidates must obtain such an aggregate of marks in the examination  as awhole  as  may indicate in  the  judgment  of the  Civil Service   Commissioners  a sufficiently high standard of general proficiency.     6. It  will  rest with the Civil Service Commissioners to determine the departments to which the successful candidates shall be assigned.   In making the assignments theCommissioners   will  be guided by the requirements of  the  public  service  and  will* Note     ENGLISH COMPOSITION.-Candidates will be required to write an essay or letter.    The work of every candidate will be valued in accordance with the following principles :     Irrelevance will be regarded as the most serious fault  in an  esaay or letter, but incoherence, obscurity,needless repetition, diffuseness, will also be reckoned as grave defects.    On the other hand, logical and orderly development of the subject, lucidity and just proportion, will be looked upon &quot;as cardinal merits.    Bad grammar, the incorrect use of words and phrases, and serious errors of punctuation, will be heavilypunished.    English composition is taken into account in all subjects.    HANDWRITING. The essentials of good handwriting are Legibility and Speed.    The term legibility is to be understood in a wide sense, as covering anything that aids rapid reading.Neatness does so  and is  consequently a  merit.  Irregularity  by  offending  the eye reduces the speed of reading, and  is thus  a defect.  The importance of such merits and defects is settled entirely by their  effecton legibility.    Handwriting is taken into account in  all  subjects.    SPELLING. A spelling recognised  by any  standard  English  dictionary  is accepted as  correct :recognition by an American  dictionary is no guarantee of acceptance.  Spelling is taken into account  in allsubjects.    PRECIS-WRITING. A limit  may be prescribed for the  number of words that the precis should contain.  Failure  to keep within  the  prescribed  limit will eutail  loss of marks.   It  is useful for the candidate to  have  some idea of the number of words she is  accustomed to write on an unruled foolscappage.    This subject does not include indexing.    ARITHMETIC. A knowledge of recurring decimals is not required.    For full credit the working must be clearly arranged and immediately intelligible.    A result may  be asked for to a certain approximation, or the data may themselves be only approximate.In such a case, to  give the result to a greater degree  of accuracy than is asked for or is justified by the data will entail loss of marks.    GENERAL  PAPER. This  paper is  intended  to test both  intelligence and knowledge ;  it may include among other test questions on matters historical, geographical, scientific, literary, economic,  social and political.    it  i2fino                                                                          ji
