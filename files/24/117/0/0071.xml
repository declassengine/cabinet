In the opinion of the Army Council, the next sixmonths will prove an exceptionally critical period in thehistory of Europe.   The possibilities of Bolshevik attacks eitheragainst Poland or Roumania, or against both States, thedesperate economic position and possible collapse of Austria,and the social and economic position of Europe and the world ingeneral must he home in mind.   There is no doubt thatBolshevism, and not Germany, is at present the danger to thepeace of Europe.   The Germans have not the artillery)aeroplanes, submarines, munitions, transport, money nor havethey the will to resume military operations against the Alliesfor some time to .come*   A stable Germany is essential to thepeace of Europe, and It must be recognised that the Orgesch andEinwohnerwehr constitute a strong force on the side of lawand order.4.   At the sane time, these organisations, if allowed tocontinue indefinitely, will form a military danger in so far asthey constitute an aid to possible future mobilization; atime limit must therefore be fixed for their disarmament anddisbandment.5.   The Army Council therefore agree with Lord D^Abernonthat we should not press the question of disarmament of theCivil Population in too peremptory a.manner, and should give time for the German Government to exercise its influence onthe Bavarians and East Prussians.6.   As regards the disbanchnent of the Orgesch and theEinwohnerwehr, the Army Council strongly favour a solution onthe lines suggested In former reports from Lord D&apos;Abemonand General Malcolm, i.e. decentralization and gradual reduction, the force to be placed under the recognised civil authorities instead of being, as is at present the case, withthe Orgesch, a more or less private concern.War Office, S.W.0154/5531.

7. As regards the occupation of the Ruhr, the Army Council are in complete agreement with the views expressed by Lord D&apos; Abernon.
