TYPHUS  IN  POLAND.RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY AT ITS MEETING    HELD ON TUESDAY^ 7th DECEMBER 1920,  (morning)THE ASSEMBLY RESOLVES:     lo   To address an urgent and immediate  appeal  to  allthe countries of the world for an adequate fund for  pro-  &apos;secuting an effective campaign against epidemic diseasein Eastern Europe,  beginning with Poland as a centre and that tho Office International d&apos;Hygiene Publique,the Comite International de la Croix Rouge and the Leagueof Red Cross Societies, be earnestly asked to co-operate in the matter.     2.   That the  President be empowered to  nominate aCommittee of not more than 3 delegates of the assembly to examine the quest&apos;on of the funds necessary for the campaign against Typhus and to take any steps possible before the end of the Session of the Assembly to secure these funds,     3,   The Assembly approves of the action taken  by  theCouncil and the reports submitted by the various Committeesand sub-Committees  of the Assembly which have consideredthe subject, and pending the result of the appeal feels that it is imperatively necessary to make at  oncesuch a beginning of the campaign as may be possible  withinthe limits of the funds already promised.

ENCLOSURE 2.                j  TYPHUS CAMPAIGN.      By the Terns of the Resolution passed by the general assembly at its 15th plenary meeting on the^th December theundersigned committee of three delegates were instructed&quot;to examine the question of the funds necessary for the fight against typhus and to take any steps possible before the end of the session of the Assembly to secure these fundson        In the Resolution passed by the Assembly on thesame day, dealing with the general question of epidemicdiseases in Eastern Europe, especially typhus and cholera,emphasis was laid on the imperative necessity for an-early -start of the campaign within the limits of the funds already promised.        It appears that &quot;a sum of approximately (? 170,O0O)can thus be made avdlable in the very near future exclusive of -the very considerable assistance promised by the Leagueof Red Cross. Societies who are co-operat.ing in the Campaign.The Epidemic Commission of the League of Nations proposeto start operations in the area which is most severelyinflicted at the present time, viz., the northern partof the eastern territory now under.Polish administration*In this area it is proposed to establish and equip furtherepidemic hospitals and cleansing stations: . to providemotor ambulance transport for these hospitals thus enabling them to work over a wider area; by suj^ply soap disinfectants,disinfecting apparatus etc., etc., ,         -hen further funds become available operations-willbe extended to&apos; ^ther areas urgently calling for attention.
        In view of tho conditions disclosed in the reportof tho three medical experts to the League of Nations It isclear that the sums already promised are altogether inadequate for the purpose in hand,   17e consider that the sum of ttfomillion stealing originally estimated is necessary for a really efficient campaign.  In the circumstances, we feel sure you will make every effort to;ascertain immediately whatsums your Government will be in a position to contributein addition -to that already promised,                             &apos;   Sir George FOSTER (Canada)                                       LONDON (Netherlands)                                          RESTREPO (Columbia),2, Whitehall Gardens, S,&apos;?.
