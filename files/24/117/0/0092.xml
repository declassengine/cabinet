[This Document is the Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, j                       ......................                               : 123                Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1920.SECRET.    IN May 1918 His Majesty&apos;s Government published a statement which, so far as was then  expedient in the public interest,  summarised without disclosing sources of  information and  channels of communication,  evidence and documents in  the possession of the Government showing the active connection between the  leaders ofthe Sinn Fein Movement and the German Government.    The following statement amplifies the  previous narrative  and reveals (so  faras seems at present expedient) in greater detail certain of the documents provingthe intrigues between Sinn Fein and Germany.    It is desirable for the purpose of throwing light upon some of these documents to mention certain facts  which occurred before war was declared in August  1914.    In  1911, 1912, 1913  and 1914  a series  of articles appeared in seditious  Irishnewspapers and in various organs of the Irish American press in the United Statesurging a German Irish Alliance in the event of war between Germany and England,and they were widely circulated also in pamphlet form.  One of them was &quot;Ireland,Germany and  the next War.&quot;  It was reissued immediately on the outbreak of  thewar together  with another  entitled &quot;The  Crime  against Europe.&quot;    Sir RogerCasement was the author of these two pamphlets.   This literature insisted on  the strategic importance of Ireland as a factor of supreme importance in relation to  seapower,  and urged  that in the event of England being  defeated Ireland would atthe Peace Conference secure through Germany her independence.    In  1912  the  first-mentioned  of  Casement&apos;s  articles  was  sent  by him   toVon Bernhardi.   It was  translated and  widely  circulated  in  Germany  andattracted considerable attention and discussion in the German press.  Immediatelyafter war was declared Kuno Meyer, who had been Professor of Celtic Languagesin Liverpool University, became associated with Casement in reproducing these and similar  articles in a cheap pamphlet  form grouped together under the title               &quot;IRELAND, GERMANY AND THE  FREEDOM OF THE SEAS.&quot;                 &quot; A POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF THE WAR OF 1914.&quot;                    &quot; To FREE THE SEAS, FREE  IRELAND.&quot;    Large quantities of the pamphlet were printed in Germany as well as  inAmerica.   Excerpts were also issued in leaflet form and immense numbers weresmuggled into Ireland and circulated as German propaganda by Sinn Fein..    The introduction to the pamphlet prepared  by Casement and  Kuno Meyerexplains the character of this propaganda which  had been  commenced in 1911:         &quot;The following articles were begun in 1911  under the  title,  &apos;Ireland,    Germany  and  the Next War,&apos; and were intended for private circulation only    among a few interested  friends  of both countries.        &quot;Part I was written in August 1911, Parts II to IV were written at odd    moments,  between the end of 1912 and  November 1913.        &quot; The  whole  six parts furnish in outline the  case for a  German-Irish    alliance as this presented itself to the writer&apos;s mind when the world was still    at peace.        &quot; It was  the writer&apos;s intention to  show in succeeding chapters how  the    vital needs of European peace,  of European freedom of  the seas  and of  Irish    national life and prosperity were indissolubly linked with the cause of Germany    in the struggle so clearly impending between that country and. Great Britain.        &quot; The war has come sooner than was expected,  the rest of the writer&apos;s    task must be essayed not with the authors pen, but with the  rifle of the  Irish    Volunteer.  As a contribution to the cause of  Irish freedom  this presentment    of  the cause  for  Germany, friend of  Ireland and foe of England, is now    published.&quot;
    When the war began  Casement was in America.  He was in close touch withthe Irish Revolutionary Associations there.  John Devoy, the ex-Fenian, was  themost prominent leader&quot; of these Associations.  He was  during the  war the chiefagent in America for communication between Germany  and Sinn Fein,  and was described by Von Skal, one of Count Von Bernstorff s staff in Washington, as their&quot; Confidential Agent &quot; in a despatch from  the  German Embassy in America to berlin in February 1916.  He  was known as &quot; Sean Fear &quot; (The Old Man)  amongthe Irish revolutionaries.  Casement left America and arrived in Germany shortly after the war had commenced, and (as will appear from the documents disclosed) he maintained communication with  Devoy through the Germans.   He  had also beensuggesting to the German Embassy the  formation of  an Irish Legion  from Irish risoners of war.  The Germans arranged for Casement&apos;s return to Berlin where e had been prior to his visit to America.    On the 27th September 1914, the following despatch  was sent from the GermanEmbassy:     &quot; September 27th, 1914.  G.N. 72.           German Embassy,  Washington, to  Foreign Office, Berlin.    &quot;No. 166 of 25th September.        &quot; Reply to Despatch No. A 322 and with  reference to Report No. A 164.        &quot; I  am  telegraphing,  because written reports are too unsafe.  I  do  not    think it necessary in this matter to be too much exercised about American public    opinion,  as we are most likely  to find friends  here if we give  freedom to    oppressed peoples, such as  the Poles, the Finns and the Irish.  What American    public opinion is afraid of.  so far as it is against  us, is in the event  of  our    victory,  an  excessive  extension  of  our frontiers over areas where  foreign    languages are spoken.  The  decisive point seems  to  me to lie in the question    whether any prospect of an understanding with  England is now  in view, or    must we  prepare ourselves for a life and death struggle ?  If so, I recommend    falling in with Irish wishes, provided that there  are really Irishmen who are    prepared to help us.  The formation of an Irish  Legion from Irish prisoners    of war would be a grand idea if only it could be carried out.         &quot;It is said that the  Irish Catholic priest Sexton, teacher at the Stilly    Institute in Berlin, and nephew of the  Bishop of Cork, is being detained in    Berlin.   The Irish here request that his return to Ireland may  be  facilitated.    Irishmen here declare that Catholic Ireland will provide no voluntary recruits    for England.&quot;           German Embassy,  Washington, to  Foreign Office, Berlin.    &quot;W. No. 172.  1.10.14.         &quot;An Irish priest [sic]  named Michael  Collins and Sir Roger Casement    are going to Germany in order to visit the Irish prisoners.         &quot; I have given the former a recommendation  to F.         &quot; Casement  has  received a cable  from Dublin  reporting that the whole    of the twenty-five members nominated by Redmond on  the  Committee of the    Irish Volunteers have been expelled from  the  Committee  on  account of    Redmond&apos;s attempt to induce the Irish Volunteers to enter the English  army.&quot;    &quot; R. 547.                                    &quot;Date 3rd November, 1914.            Foreign Office. Berlin, to German Embassy, Washington.         &quot;No.  215.  With reference to Report  A. 184,  Sir  Roger  Casement  has    arrived.  His proposals are being carefully gone into.

Foreign Office,  Berlin, to German Embassy, Washington.         &quot; Casement begs  that the following intelligence may be transmitted :          &quot;For Justice Cohalan, 51, Chambers Street,  New York.         &quot; Lody&apos;s identity discovered by enemy who are greatly alarmed and taking    steps to  defend  Ireland and possibly  arrest friends.  They are ignorant here    purpose my coming Germany, but seek evidence at  all cost.  Here everything
    favourable:   authority  helping  warmly.   Send messenger  immediately  to    Ireland fully informed verbally.  No letter (?upon) him.  He should be native-    born American citizen,  otherwise arrest likely.   Let him despatch priest here    via Christiania quickly.  German Legation there will arrange passage; also let    him tell Bigger, solicitor, Belfast (?to) conceal everything belonging to me.                                                                  &quot;ROGER.    &quot; ZlMMERMANN.&quot;    Lody mentioned in  the despatch was  a  German  spy  who was arrested atKillarney on the 2nd October, 1914, and executed in the Tower on the 6th November,1914.  On the 20th November, 1914, the following official statement was issued fromthe German Foreign Office.  It was circulated to the German press and sent out by wireless telegram.  It was printed as a leaflet in  Berlin and America and sent ingreat  quantities  to Sinn  Fein and German  agents  in  Ireland,  where  it was distributed extensively:                            &quot;GERMANY AND IRELAND.                             &quot;Official Statement.                                              &quot; Berlin, November 20^, 1914.         &quot;The well-known Irish Nationalist, Sir Roger Casement, who has arrived    in Berlin  from the United States, has been received at the Foreign Office.  Sir    Roger Casement pointed out that statements were being published in Ireland,    apparently with the authority of the  British Government behind them,  to the    effect that a German victory would inflict great loss upon the Irish people, whose    homes, churches, priests, and lands would be at the mercy of an invading army     actuated  only by motives  of pillage and  conquest.   Recent  utterances of    Mr. Redmond on his recruiting  tour  in Ireland and many pronouncements of    the British  press in Ireland to  the above effect have been widely circulated,    Sir Roger pointed out, and have caused natural apprehension among Irishmen    as to the German attitude towards Ireland in the event of a German victory in    the present war.         &quot;Sir Roger sought a convincing  statement of German intentions towards    Ireland that  might reassure his countrymen all over the world, and particularly    in  Ireland and America,  in view of these disquieting statements emanating    from responsible British quarters.         &quot;In  reply to this enquiry,  the Acting Secretary of State  at the Foreign    Office, by order of the Imperial Chancellor, has  made the following official    declaration:                              &quot; Official Statement.         &quot;The German Government  repudiates the evil intentions attributed to  it    in the statements referred to by Sir Roger Casement, and takes this opportunity    to  give a categoric assurance that the  German Government desires only the    welfare of the Irish people, their country,  and their institutions.         &quot;The Imperial Government formally declares that under no circumstances    would Germany invade  Ireland with a view to its conquest or the overthrow of    any native institutions in that country.         &quot; Should the fortune of this great war, that was not of Germany&apos;s seeking.    ever bring in its course German troops to the shores of Ireland, they would land    there, not as an army of invaders to pillage and destroy, but as the forces of a    Government  that is inspired bv  good-will towards a country and a people for    whom Germany desires only NATIONAL PROSPERITY and NATIONAL FREEDOM.&quot;    Zehn, 21.12/ Zeit gn.    The following letters which were intercepted were written by  Casement andenclosed in a covering envelope addressed  to a lady then in London.  The letter  toProfessor Eoin McNeill requests him to have the official declaration of the GermanGovernment published throughout Ireland by every possible means.

I am in Berlin,  and if Ireland will do her   duty,  rest assured Germany will do hers towards us, our cause,  and our whole   future.       &quot; The enemy are  doing  everything to keep  the truth out of Ireland, and   are even going to try to get the Vatican on their  side, as in the time of Parnell.   Once  our people, clergy and volunteers know that Germany, if victorious, will   do her best to aid us in our efforts to  achieve an independent  Ireland,  every   man at home must stand for Germany and Irish freedom.       &quot;I am entirely assured of the goodwill of this Government towards our   country,  and beg you  to proclaim it far and wide.   They will  do all  in their   power to help us to win national freedom, and it  lies with Ireland and Irishmen   themselves to prove that they are worthy to be free.       &quot; Send to me here in Berlin, by way of Christiania,  if possible, one or two   thoroughly  patriotic Irish priests-young men best.  Men like Father  Murphy   of Vinegar Hill and for the same purpose.       &quot; Rifles and ammunition can be found and good officers,  too.  First send   the priest  or  priests, as  I need them for a special  purpose here,  you  can   guess for        &quot; If the priest or priests can get  to Christiania (Norway), they can get   here through the German Legation at  Christiania.   Our friends in America   will  pay all expenses.   Warn all our people,  too, of the present intrigue at   Rome to bring  pressure of religion to bear on a question wholly political and   national.   Our enemy will stick at no crime to-day against Ireland, as  you   will  soon know. This official declaration of the German Government has been   sent out to all  the German representatives abroad for world-wide publication.   It may be followed by another still more to the point but much depends on your   staunchness and courage at home.        &quot; Tell  all to trust the Germans and to trust me.   We shall win  everything   if you are brave and  faithful to the old cause.  Try and send me word here to   Berlin by  the  same channel as this.    Tell me all your needs at home, viz.,   rifles, officers, men.    Send priest or priests at all costs one not afraid to fight   and  die for Ireland.    The enemy are  hiding the truth.   The Germans  will   surely, under God, defeat both Russia and France and compel a peace  that will   leave Germany stronger than before.   They already have 550,000 prisoners of   war  in Germany, and Austria 150,000, and Russia has been severely defeated   in Poland.         &quot; India and Egypt will probably both be in  arms.  Even if Germany cannot    reach England to-day, we can only gain by helping Germany now, as with the    understanding come  to, Ireland will have a strong and enlightened friend to    help to ultimate independence.         &quot;We  may win everything by this  war if we are true to Germany;  and if    we do not win to-day we insure international  recognition of Irish  nationality    and  hand  on an uplifted cause for our  sons.         &quot; Reply by this route:  A letter  for me, addressed to  Mr.  Hammond,    76, Wilhelmstrasse, Berlin, to be enclosed in one addressed to Messrs. Wambersin    and  Son, Rotterdam.&quot;    With regard to Casement&apos;s statement  that India would probably be in arms,reference may be made to the Report of the East India (Sedition Committee, 1918),Ctf.9190  ChNll &quot;German Plots,&quot; from  which it appears that in October  1914
Chempakaraman Pillai, who will be found afterwards associated with the German-Irish Society, was employed by the German Foreign Office in Berlin and establishedthere the &quot;Indian National Party,&quot;  attached to the German  General Staff.  Themembers of this &quot; staff &quot; were engaged in the production of anti-British literaturefor propaganda; in directing a campaign to win Indian prisoners of war captured by the  Germans from the British ranks from  their allegiance; and in arranging forthe smuggling of arms into India.   A Captain Boehm  (whose name will appearfurther down) was engaged in making  arrangements in the  United States with indian agents of Germany in America to despatch cargoes of arms and ammunition to the  Indian revolutionaries.  Arms were shipped,  but captured.  The  methods and fate of these Indian intrigues were very similar to those of  the German dealings with Sinn Fein.    &quot; December 1914.  G.N. 83.

MacGarrity, Philadelphia.        &quot;Send  by Ambassadors Messenger at once a copy of &apos; The Crime against    Europe &apos; to  Hammond.        &quot; I can publish here.&quot;    &quot;The Crime against Europe&quot; was (as above  stated) incorporated with other of Casement&apos;s articles in the pamphlet&quot; Ireland, Germany and the Freedom of these as,  A Possible Outcome of the  War of  1914, To Free the Seas, Free Ireland.&quot;The pamphlet was printed and published both in Germany and in America.    Casement after his arrival in  Germany was actively engaged in endeavouringto seduce Irish prisoners of war from their allegiance.  An attempt which was almosta complete failure.  Kuno Meyer was associated with him in this scheme.    A letter was written from the Berlin Foreign Office the 28th December, 1914,addressed to Casement by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, HerrZimmermann.    It stated that  the Imperial  Government had accepted  casement&apos;s proposalfor the formation of an Irish Brigade to fight only in the cause of Irish nationalityunder the conditions contained in the contract already concluded between Casementand the German Government.  These conditions provided that  in certain circum-stances the Irish Brigade should be sent to Ireland well furnished with  stores and munitions  to help to equip the Irish for a united attempt to restore freedom toIreland by force of arms.  Among the special conditions mentioned were the follow-ing, namely, that in  the event of  a German naval victory rendering it possible toreach Ireland, the German  Government undertook to assist the Irish Brigade witha German auxiliary corps under the command of German officers in German trans-ports  which would be  landed on the Irish coast.   The  landing in Ireland  would,however, only be considered expedient in the event of a German victory offering good prospects for a successful passage to Ireland, failing which, the Irish Brigade wouldbe employed in Germany or elsewhere, solely, however, in the manner already agreedupon  with Casement.   In such a contingency  the  Irish Brigade might  be sent to egypt to render assistance in restoring Egyptian independence.    On the 6th  December, 1914, Kuno Meyer addressed a meeting of the Clan-na-Gael,  of Long Island, New York.   &quot; It was in the summer of 1911 (he said) that Ilost all hope of peace between England and  Germany.  I have visited many of our prisoners&apos; camps, and had many talks with  the English and Irish among them. At astation called Lohne I fell in with a train  containing Irish soldiers who were beingdrafted from all parts  of Germany into one camp for the mysterious purpose whichI have hinted at before.  That an  invasion both of England and Ireland will  takeplace  sooner or later I,  together with all my countrymen, firmly believe.  The attack upon  Yarmouth, the mines placed near Malin Head, and what happened in LoughSwilly and  at Sheerness have already foreshadowed it.  And when Germany  hasobtained the great objects for which she fights, the nations that now bear the yoke ofEngland unwillingly will, surely, not be forgotten, and in the case of two  of them atleast,  the  oldest and the youngest of England&apos;s conquests, Ireland and Egypt, therestitution of their autonomy  must be one of  the  conditions of peace.&quot;  (See the&quot; Times,&quot;  the 24th December, 1914.)    For an account of the  proceedings of  Sinn Fein in  Ireland and its  connection,there  with the  Irish  Revolutionary  Association in America, in  alliance with theGerman organisations there, down  to the outbreak of the Rebellion of Easter 1916,reference is made to the Report of the Royal Commission on the Rebellion in Ireland1916,  Cd.  8279, and the Minutes of Evidence 1916,  Cd. 8311.    The report states, page 6, &quot; It is now a  matter of common notoriety that the Irishvolunteers have been in communication with the authorities in Germany, and were,for a long time,  known to be supplied with money through Irish-American societies.It was so stated in public by Mr. John McNeill on the 8th November, 1914.  It was suspected  long before  the  outbreak  that some  of  the money came  from Germansources.&quot;    Early in 1915 after the promulgation in Ireland of military orders under theDefence of the Realm Act for the action of the inhabitants in the event of invasion,counter notices were placarded calling on the people to disobey the orders  issued andto welcome the German troops as friends.  The following is a specimen notice : 
&quot;PEOPLE OF WEXFORD.    kk Take no notice of the police order to destroy your own property, and leave yourhomes if a German army lands in Ireland. When the Germans come they will comeas friends,  and to put an  end to English rule in Ireland.  Therefore, stay in yourhomes, and assist as far as possible the  German troops.  Any stores,  hay, corn, orforage taken by the Germans will be paid for by them.&quot;    In  February 1915 great  quantities  of this  proclamation and of  the  &quot; official statement&apos;&apos; Germany and Ireland,  which had been printed in Berlin, were dis-covered  at Enniscorthy, in the house  of  Laurence De Lacy,  who evaded arrest andfled to America.  He was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment at San Franciscofor plotting with German agents there.   After his escape to  America De Lacey wasin touch with the Sinn Fein Party in Ireland,                              The Friends of Peace.      In February 1915, Albert Sander, a German spy, who had offices at 150, Nassau  Street, New York, formed an organisation called the &quot;Friends of Peace&quot; the object  of the  society being to assist Germany in securing an  embargo on the exportation  of arms from the United States, and to prevent America from entering the war.  Linked up and affiliated with  this society were the  Clan-na-Gael, the Socialist  Party  of  New  York,  a German-Irish  association  called &quot; The  American  Truth&apos;  Society,&quot; and a number of German-American societies, and among the chairmen were  John Devoy and John A. 0&apos;Leary.      In February  1917,  Sander was convicted in New  York  for  initiating  and  providing  in the United  States for a military enterprise against Great Britain and  Ireland and sending spies to Great Britain and Ireland,  and was sentenced to two  years&apos; imprisonment.      The following despatch was sent in January 1916  from Berlin to Washington,  and afterwards published by the American Secretary  of State:       Telegram from the  German Foreign  Office to Count von  Bernstorff :-                 &quot; German Foreign Office to Count Von Bernstorff.                                                   &quot;1916, January 3 (secret).          &quot;  General Staff  desires  energetic  action in regard to proposed destruction      of Canadian Pacific  Railway at several points with a view to complete and pro-      tracted interruption of traffic.

Shortly before the rebellion of Easter 1916 there was founded  in the UnitedStates the association  known as &quot; The Friends of Irish Freedom.&quot;     In  February  1916 Judge Cohalan,  T. St. John Gaffney,  and Jeremiah A.0&apos;Leary issued a call for an Irish Race Convention which was held in New York onthe 4th  and 5th March,  1916.  A permanent organisation was then formed.  Thepresident, three of the vice-presidents, the treasurer and secretary were members ofthe Clan-na-Gael;  Judge Cohalan  was first of the board of directors; Jeremiah0&apos;Leary and  Joseph  M&apos;Garrity were  on the executive.  Of the  52  permanent members of the board  of directors 37 were members of the Clan-na-Gael, and of the17 members of the executive 15 belonged to the Clan-na-Gael.   John Devoy was oneof the association and T.  St. John Gaffney was appointed  representative  of theFriends of Irish Freedom  for Europe.   A bureau was established  at Stockholm,whither Gaffney  repaired,  and from there and at  Berlin maintained, along  withGeorge  Chatterton-Hill,  close relations  between the German  Government and thevarious  Irish-American  and  Sinn  Fein organisations.   De Valera,  Monteith,Mellowes and others of the Irish Sinn Fein rebels who went to America after the rebellion became participators in the work of the Friends of Irish Freedom.     This congress was convoked for the purpose of  &quot; arranging means to  enableIreland  to recover independence  after the war.&quot;   The  convention  demanded the recognition of Ireland as an independent nation, and passed a resolution that        &quot;We hereby appeal to the Great Powers to recognise that Ireland is an     European island and not an English island, and to appreciate the fact that the     complete independence of Ireland from the Britannic Empire is the essential     and indispensable condition of the freedom of the seas.&quot;     The Friends  of  Irish Freedom maintained close  touch with the Germanorganisations in America both before and after the  rebellion.     The bureau  of  the   Friends of  Irish  Freedom  in  Stockholm  was  at286  Artillerigatan, and was under  the direction of T. St. John Gaffney.  He willbe found acting along with Chatterton-Hill as the accredited agent of Sinn Feinat Stockholm and Berlin  in 1917 and 1918.     The Indiska  Central  Committee (an Indian  seditious organisation)  sharedquarters at 286 Artillerigatan with the Friends of Irish Freedom.J Nr. 109/16.Most Secret.                                     Neio York, February 10, 1916.    Extract from  Report of  Confidential  Agent,  John Devoy,  on  the  position inIreland, which has  been delivered to the Imperial Embassy for telegraphic  trans-mission :         &quot; Unanimous opinion that action cannot be postponed much longer.  Delay     disadvantageous to us.  We  can now  put  up an effective fight.  Our enemies     cannot allow us much more time.  The arrest of our leaders would hamper us     severely.  Initiative on our part is necessary.  The Irish regiments which  are in.     sympathy with  us are being gradually replaced by English regiments.        &quot; We have therefore  decided to begin action on Easter Saturday.  Unless     entirely new circumstances arise we  must have your arms and munitions in     Limerick between  Good Friday and Easter Saturday.  We expect German help     immediately after beginning action.   We might be compelled to begin earlier.&quot;     The Confidential Agent will advise  (the Irish) if at all possible  to wait, and willpoint out the difficulties in the  way of  (our) giving help, but nevertheless believes that
  rcumstances  make delay impossible.   The Committee here will come to a decisionindependently.

They are:  forwarning  that the vessel is coming,  &quot; Finn &quot; ;  for warning that something wrong has happened,&quot; Bran.&quot;  In case the fishing vessels are not equipped with wireless apparatus,the without wire  signal could be sent from Germany and our friends would  surelypick them  up as they have numerous private receiving  stations, though  they cannotsend out anything.  &quot;Bran&quot; sent from Germany would mean that something had gone wrong, whether  delay in starting or interruption of voyage, and another  datementioned with this would mean that  the affair was postponed to that date.   &quot; Finn &quot;would mean that  the  cargo had started on time to arrive  about date already arranged.It is important that they should be  able to make the necessary arrangements in time,and be able to conscript sufficient force at  right moment.  They are quite preparedto take  ah chances, but want to prearrange as  much as possible to do.  In case a submarine  should  come into Dublin  Bay  in  connection  with  landing of  anything,either material or officers, the signals &quot; Ashling &quot;  would ensure immediate recognition.If a submarine should enter the Bay unconnected with  any expedition no signal isnecessary, and she should go  right up to the Pigeon- house, which is now used as anelectric  plant, and a sewage station where boats  are constantly entering  and leavingand there are no nets.

In case the  trawlers are fitted  with  wireless, they  are to  make the  followingsignals in the Limerick expedition :     As a sign that ships are coming, FINN.    As a sign that something untoward has occurred, BRAN.    If the  trawler is not fitted with wireless, then send wireless from Germany.  Thereare numerous private receiving stations in Ireland.   BRAN sent from Germany is tohave the meaning that something has gone  wrong. The addition of a date means thedate to which the expedition has been postponed. FINN means that the cargo  has left at the right time.  If submarines proceed into Dublin Bay in  connection with the landing of  war material or officers, then the signal is ASHLING.    If only submarines come, no signal is necessary.   They are then to go straight upto the Pigeon-house, where they can proceed  in  and  out at any time.  No nets  havebeen set.

The Irish desire to know if submarines are coming  to Dublin Harbour; if not,do they  intend to blockade the harbour, and, if possible, Limerick Harbour ?    The landing of a  body of troops, however small, is urgently desired,  and they further suggest a simultaneous strong demonstration by airships and at sea.    In April  1916 a seizure  was made by  the  United States  Government at theoffice  of  Wolf von Igel; 60, Wall Street, New  York,  of certain  documents  whichproved the intimate relations between  the  accredited  representatives of  the Kaiser inthe United States and Irish plotters against the laws and security of the  United States,as well as against the British Empire.  Excerpts from them were published by theAmerican Government.   As  far  as they  have been already disclosed, they give aglimpse into a portion of the intrigue between the Irish revolutionaries and the GermanGovernment.   Von Igel had established in the autumn of 1914 what was ostensibly an&quot; advertising agency &quot; in Wall  Street.  The  business carried on there  had, however,nothing whatever to do with advertising    He was an  official of the  German.

Casement left  Kiel about  the  12th  April, 1916, in  a German  submarine,accompanied by Monteith, a dismissed ordnance  store conductor.  He was an IrishVolunteer organiser who had gone to America and thence to Germany.   They landedon the coast of Kerry on Good Friday, the 21st April, 1916.   Casement was captured ;Monteith escaped.  A  German ship, the &quot;Aud,&quot; carrying  arms for the rebels, was intercepted by a British cruiser, and her commander sunk the &quot; Aud.&quot;    The rebellion broke out in Dublin on Easter Monday,  the 24th April, 1916-aday after the scheduled time.   It was suppressed  upon the 1st  May, when  the rebelssurrendered.  On the 24th April-as arranged  between the  German Government andthe Sinn Fein leaders-a Zeppelin raid was made on East Anglia.  On the  25th Aprila German naval raid was made on Lowestoft and Yarmouth, and a Zeppelin raid  onEssex and Kent.    The Proclamation of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, signed  bythe rebel leaders, declared that          &quot; Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary    organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military    organisations, the Irish Volunteers  and  the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently    perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to reveal    itself,  she  now  seizes  that  moment, and,  supported by her exiled children in    America and by gallant Allies  in Europe, but relying in  the first on her own    strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.&quot;    This Secret Revolutionary Organisation was the Irish Republican Brotherhood, orthe Olan-na-Gael, which carries on  the tradition of the Fenian Brotherhood.  From1861  to 1865  it had been  in  process  of  establishment  in  America  as an IrishRevolutionary  Society, and  was  known  to  the  public  as  the  Fenian or IrishRevolutionary Brotherhood, or I.R.B.   It  was subsequently extended  through  theClan-na-Gael.   The Clan-na-Gael was composed of a federation  of clubs divided intodistricts, and  had,  and still has, very wide ramifications in  America,  and a close connection  through the I.R.B. with Ireland.   John Devoy, the Fenian leader, had beenthe Secretary of the  Clan-na-Gael for over twenty years, and is its dominant figure.    Among other prominent members  is Judge Cohalan, who  became a  member in1899, and has been  chairman  of very many of the  biennial conventions held by theorganisation.  He is an ex officio, member of the Executive.
     Other prominent members were Joseph M&apos;Garrity, of Philadelphia ;  John T. Ryanof Buffalo;  John  P.  Keating,  Jeremiah  0&apos;Leary, and  his  brother, John 0&apos;LearySt. John Gaffney, who was formerly United States consul at Dresden and Munich, butdismissed  from that office by the United States Government.   We find  Dr. McCartan,Mellowes  and  Monteith, all of  whom fled from Ireland after the  rebellion, closely associated with  its councils and operations.   Kuno Meyer  was  in touch with theClan-na-Gael when in America.    The total casualties arising  out of the  rebellion were as follows :-- 	Killed.	Wounded.	Missing.	Total.Military officers .. ,, other ranks R.I.O. officers ,, other ranks D.M.P......

Field General Courts-Martial were at  once constituted for the trial of the prisonerstaken in the rebellion ;  3,430 men and 79  women were arrested.   Of these  1,424 menand 73 women were released after enquiry.   170 men and one woman were tried byCourts Martial, and of these 159 men and  one woman were convicted and the remaining11 acquitted.  The remainder of the prisoners,  1,836 men and five women, were sentto England and interned there.    Of the  160 persons convicted by Courts-Martial          15  were sentenced to death and executed.                          ,, penal servitude for life.                          ,, 20 years&apos; penal  servitude.

    For the murder of Head Constable Rowe at Fermoy on 2nd May          Thomas Kent.    In  all 90 persons were  sentenced to death by the Courts-Martial, but in onlyfifteen cases were  the sentences carried out, the sentences in the other cases beingcommuted to various terms of penal servitude by the G.O.C.-in-Chief.    Of  the persons sent to England for internment, 1,272 were subsequently dischargedafter their cases had been investigated, and later on at Christmas 1916 the  remainder were released.   In the general amnesty which was granted in June prior to the settingup  of the  Irish Convention all persons  who  were either  interned, or undergoingsentences  of penal servitude or  imprisonment  for  complicity in  the rebellion, were released.    In  a letter written by P. H. Pearse the night before his execution the followingpostscript appeared :          &quot;The help I expected from Germany failed; the British sunk the ships.&quot;    Immediately after the rebellion  the  Sinn  Fein revolutionaries in  America were found again plotting with Germany to arrange for another rising in Ireland.    On 6th May, 1916, a message, which is missing, but is  referred to as  &quot;A259 ofMay 1916,&quot; was sent from Washington to Berlin requesting further help for  the Irish,and their correlated energies in stirring up sedition in India appear from the followingcommunication:     Despatch  in envelope addressed :         Mr. W. Gramms,             1914-14th Street,  Washington, D.C.        Pmk.   Copenhagen, 29.5.16.A. No. 49 of 27th May.To Ambassador.  Washington.

I shall look  forward to your report on the results of your enquiry with interest.                                                 (Signed)     ZIMMERMANN.

A 315, in continuation of A 259 of the 6th of last month.    The Irish leaders write me as follows:                                                               12th June, 1916.    We are completely cut off from  all communication  with our friends in Ireland.All we can  get just now is that information brought by returning American citizens who had passed before the rebellion, and they only bring  stories about the fighting.None  of them have seen any man who could give them inside information.  All such men have either been shot  or imprisoned, except a few who are in hiding.   It is saidthat some of these have escaped and are on their way to America.  Two of those namedcould  give us valuable information if  they get here.    The British casualties in Dublin  were 2,700 men.  It is very improbable that anyvessel was able to land a cargo.   But  the amount of ammunition the Dublin rebels had
astonished us, whether they got it from a submarine  or any other source we cannotsay, but they had an ample supply.   It was the artillery and machine-guns that beatthem.  The&apos;Inspector-General of Constabulary said before  the  Irish Commission thatthe troops and police captured 350,000 rounds of ammunition all over Ireland.  Theywere able to  manufacture a lot with machinery  we sent  them,  and that  they were able  to duplicate by  that quantity seems too  much.  The  sending of Sir  RogerCasement to Ireland was very unfortunate.  His arrest with that of Bailey enabled theGovernment to frustrate  the Kerry rising and put them on their guard, even withoutthe betrayal from here.    We have sent 1,0001 to defend Casement by Doyle, the American  lawyer.  our information is, that instead  of  the harsh measures cowing the people,  we have  tenfriends now for every one we had before the  rebellion.  It is  the same here.   But itwill take us a little time to open communication with  the right people.  No  one can get either in or out of Ireland now.                                                             BERNSTORFF.

New York, July 25, 1916.Rye, New York, July 14, 1916.A 349.Contents : Ireland and Sir Roger Casement.    In continuation of report A 315 of 16th June, 1916.    Copy of a letter which has arrived from Ireland by messenger is sent herewith.    The news which it contains is supplemented by the following verbal reports :     All  the available  indications point to  the fact that information  about  the project of landing  arms in  Ireland reached London from New York,  or, more probably  perhaps, Washington.    For several months the west coast of Ireland had been quite unwatched, when,on the (Wednesday) before Easter (Herr von Igel&apos;s papers came into the hands ofthe State Attorney  on  ? Tuesday), all  at once  the order arrived to send  out all available ships to watch  for a German steamer.    The  steamer  with  the  arms  had  entered Tralee Bay on  the evening,  ofThursday, but had  turned  back, not finding  anyone to whom to deliver the cargo.On Friday  she again put in, and  was stoppeld  by the patrol-bjoat &quot; Bluebell,&quot;whereupon she was sunk by her crew.   It must be assumed that  the steamer hadnot received the instructions  not  to proceed  in until early on Saturday.  In viewof this mistake, the circumstance  becomes  (? explicable) that the  leader  MacNeillput off the rising which had been arranged for Easter Saturday, as  the letter shows.    It has become apparent that Casement cherished the conviction that foreignerswere  indiscreet, and he alone, by his  personal influence, could  bring  about  the liberation of his country.  He seems, in fact, to have credited himself with super-natural powers.    He sent orders to MacNeill by a (messenger) that the rising must wait till he(Casement) had arrived in Dublin or London.  (Consequently), at the moment whenthe rising could no longer be postponed, there were only 1,500 instead of the expected5,000 men available, and the reinforcements  which  hurried up from the other partsof the town and suburbs  could not get a chance to  take part in  the fighting.  Had5,000 men been available, the Castle  and harbour  could  have been seized, and thelatter kept under control.  In that case, the insurgents might well have been ableto hold out for several weeks.    According to  further  reports, the work of reorganisation had already been
begun.  Two members of the old Central Committee have so far not been arrested,and are apparently not even suspected.    They have, aiong with  some of the energetic (younger) men,  undertaken thetask of reorganisation, and are making good progress.    They report that the  number  ofv sympathisers  with  the  Insurrection  hasmultiplied tenfold and that they have enough men available to make possible anotherattempt at any time.    Also  that they have  succeeded  in procuring large  supplies of  arms  and munitions.    The lack of money has already been supplied from here.    In the near future, the Committee here will proceed to Ireland,  taking withthem the money which has been collected for the poor, and will then be in a positionto get more  accurate information.                   Enclosure.  Letter  received June 30, 1916.    Ourselves!   Ourselves!    First about press.  It is under control of authority and not a single word in the papers can be relied on. I am despatching copy of order sent to all editors. Someonegot some printed for distribution to country (R.D.Cs,, &amp;c), second copy for Americanconsumption.  We know feeling America is good because we hear nothing about itand censorship is so strict,   juet John Devoy and others  know that all chief men in dublin who were not shot are in prison; the prominent men of count(ies) also.  Thefact that very few count(ies) were in the rising did not prevent wholesale arrests.We want American friends to understand what happened and take Cork as fairlytypical example; Cork men were out as arranged for manoeuvres on Easter Sunday;county was regularly linked up, men in trim for anything.   Orders came while theywere out cancelling all arrangements.   Weather was atrocious and as nothing to be gained by  staying out ali night in the open,  men disappointed returned to their districts Sunday night.  Some men did not get home till Tuesday morning.   Mean-while the two chief officers had been making a tour of inspection all through country by automobile.  Only commander  returned to Cork Monday night.   Monday after-noon he got the news from Dublin  that the rising was to commence there at noon andan order signed by Pearse for Cork to join in.  It was late Monday evening beforeother  two staff officers got word.  Mobilisation  was out of question that night and byTuesday morning city was surrounded on all sides.  The men could not have got outif they had had munition in tons and guns in hundreds, which they had not.  it seemed to us here  that Dublin had made criminal mistake.   We have since learned that it was &quot;  Come out and fight or be disarmed &quot; Tuesday morning.  But we did not know at that time.    We still think that Inner Council were not justified in keeping MacNeill in darkso long.  I  cannot go into that now. Provinces  wished not to be left out of affair butthere certainly was regrettable disregard of provincial conditions  on the  part of dublin.  Dublin was well supplied with arms,  munitions, provinces not; Dublin hadbeen told that without arms, &amp;c, we could do nothing.  I have only written that much to explain why so few counties were &quot; out.&quot;    It is the present state of affairs I want to  deal with.  Then opinions there were divided, practically the whole country is right  now.     There are exceptions the usual Shoneen (sic) place-hunting crowd but  theshooting of leaders the wholesale arrests all over the country the shocking prisontreatment  and the continuance of Martial Law, have  acted as a tonic, and as  aquondam Imperialist said to me a short time ago, &quot; We are all Sinn Feiners now.&quot;In beginning, the week after the  rising, all the councils protested horror of Dublinbusiness and loyalty, &amp;c.   However, their tune is changing and they are resolvingagainst present regime.  No parades of volunteers are allowed.     The organisation is supposed dead, but  they are keeping in touch  with  eachother and their spirit is excellent.  Very few arms have been given up in the countryand no munitions.   In Limerick they gave all up, however they were not sufficientlyarmed to be effective.  Though many arms are hidden safely, there are not sufficient for future offence, unless supplemented.     You can realise that we are not cowed down from the fact that they contemplategiving a &apos;&apos; measure of Home Rule &apos;&apos; at once.   Here is a grave danger.  Martial Law
reigns here.    We are not allowed to hold any political meetings to protest againstpartition  of Ulster.   The  Irish  party have accepted  it  as  a compromise-toagree to exclusion of six counties.  The country is totally opposed to it, but owing toMartial Law cannot make itself heard.  Redmond says  the arrangement is until after war.  Ulster says the exclusion  is permanent, and will only agree on thatunderstanding.  We believe both Asquith and Lord French wished to get permission to apply conscription in exchange, and Redmond would gladly give it if he dared.But  that won&apos;t work.  Another thing  we would like you to know.  There was an agent from G here-is in country at present who has been sent over to find out thereal  state  of feeling in Ireland and  also to learn what probability there is of largenumber of recruits from Ireland.  The English as fighters do not seem to appeal ,othem.  He is interrogating the prison men, but N.B. his introductions are from theB. Govt. and the Irisii party probably.  We only heard accidentally through someonein touch with authority that he has been in country.   He got into touch with no one in Volunteer circles in country.  That much I can say for certain.  One  thing is certain, recruiting for the British Army is dead in Ireland.  I doubt if they have got half-a-dozen in whole country since Easter.  Our present position is this : Thereis not a leader left.  The men  are there and the women  too, full of spirit but all thereal  brains of organisation  are dead or locked up.  Anyone who could  voice thedesires of country to be represented at Peace Conference is not here to do it.  Nopapers are allowed, no speeches even if the men were there to write or make them.When  it became  clear that  Dublin  would have to surrender, Tom  Clarke drew acertain  person in Post Office aside and  confessed the whole inner history of business to that person.  Sean MacDermot also  made a statement before he died.  Naturallyit is not safe  to write these things, but the summary is  there for later on.  TomClarke, who was a very great friend of ours, had had many intimate talks with me and had told me of certain documents in our favour.  I do not want to particularisemore than that, but John Devoy will understand.   What we need now  is to get intouch with America if possible.  The men here feel that they would give anything tohave a trusted envoy sent from the Clan-na-Gael to tell them how things stand overthere and advise them as to best course of action possible.  The Home Pule move issinister.  If England can represent Ireland as contented with Home Rule we mayb,e lost at  conference, or worse  still, if she has to let Ireland be represented at PeaceConference she may have Redmond,  Prime Minister of New Home  Rule  Parliament,to represent us.   Better  Martial Law  and General Maxwell.  Hence we want youall to realise that the political wires are being pulled on all sides  to get the papersto approve the exclusion of Ulster.  Corruption  is rife, and every effort is beingmade to do the deed.   The Examiner&apos;s Cork leader to-day would make you simplysick.  We are hoping that one or two  of our own have succeeded in getting acrossthe (Atlantic) and will have told details.  1 suppose over there you have heard the story that Casement landed too soon in order to  stop  the rising and after he was arrested asked for priest to whom he gave the warning for the I.Vs.  I hope thiswill be clear.   If you get it you will  realise  that paper had to be scanty and thewriting cramped. Tell John  Devoy and the Clan-na-Gael that our hearts are full of courage, but  we count on them to help us.  An autonomous Ireland at close ofwar we must have.    If they could only be  here to see  the stupidity  and generalineptitude of our British masters they would realise that England is almost done for.The English atrocities committed in Dublin were worse than any the English said the  Germans  committed anywhere.  And all are not  known.  We  grieve for the death of our gallant men, many of whom cannot be replaced in generations, but, as most of them said when dying: Our death will win the  country and save its soul.That has  been accomplished.   They are our last martyrs, and all the fury of Govern-ment of Maxwell cannot stop  the public appreciation of them.  Their portraits areselling by thousands everywhere,   True the soul of country has been saved at  a heavy cost; but  think of the regime under which we have been living for the pasthundred years.   It was specially aimed at killing our national soul and the wonderis that we have any soul to be saved.  None but  the Gael, the unconouerable Gael,would have a  trace of nationality left.   At any rate, the end is not.   We shall cometo our own, but let our fine countrymen over there remember our leaders are gone.The brains of organisation are mostly locked up, and they must supply our  wants.&quot;Ireland at home  looks  to Ireland in America  to answer  the  call.&quot;  This is an irish reading of recruiting poster.  End.                                                            BERNSTORFF.
     The following is a copy of a letter from John Devoy to Lawrence de Lacey who had escaped as above mentioned from Enniscorthy in February 1915.  The original was found on De Lacey&apos;s premises in San Francisco:  Dear Friend,                                                 July 20th, 1916.     I avail myself of the chance of our friend returning to S.F. send you the letter by hand. Nothing is safe in the mails in this free country.     Our information as to what occurred at home, on the inside, was very meagre up to a couple of weeks ago, though we had enough to enable us to guess  the truth pretty accurately. Now authentic accounts coming by hand show us that we guessed very accurately.  One is a young lady from your country, &quot; Miss R.&quot;  She was in the thick of it all, and saw Sean McD. the night before he was shot.  She went to London first and got a permit there to come out.  She was sent by the  women.  So far as the leaders are concerned they are all either dead, in prison, or &quot; on their keeping,&quot;  but there are twenty men ready for work now for one there was  before the  fight.  The same thing  is told us by everybody, including priests  with knowledge of the whole country.     We got a long letter from Cork containing a lot of information  from there.  It was sad  as  concerned the losses of leaders, but buoyant and most hopeful. It was written by a woman on behalf of the men.     Then came a man who had  been  in prison  and was  released.  Fie is from Kilkenny, and had  very  accurate information about  what occurred immediately before the fight.   Two men from there had attended the meeting in Dublin on Easter Sunday, where, after the mix-up about the countermand, it was decided to fight.     Then a young fellow from Liverpool, a Waterford chap, who does not belong to anything, but is all right,  brought me a message verbally, from the son of  a Dublin friend now dead.  He was in the post office and his brother was with Ashe at Ash- bourne.  Fie said the S.C. had been reorganised.  He will likely get here himself.  He is a very well  educated young man and his father was all right.  The other brother is in prison.  Three days ago a Limerick man got here, after a lot  of trouble, and brought verbal messages from the commandant there, which covered a lot of ground. It included messages received from Monteith after he landed and the plans  they had to dispose of the cargo if it had landed.  He also had  the story of the countermand of the Easter Sunday mobilisation  (which reached them by automobile from Dublin), and the subsequent order from Pearse to turn out on Monday.   They could not then.     A very long letter has come from Kerry, of which I have as yet only a verbal synopsis, but the document itself will be in my hands in a few days.  And yesterday I received by a trustworthy messenger to Mike 0&apos;R. the stories of four eye-witnesses and participants for publication.   They came from London.   They will make about seven or eight columns in next week&apos;s paper.     The substance of it all is that the betrayal of the information about the shipload of arms by Wilson&apos;s  men enabled the English to catch the vessel.  There is  no doubt at all about  this.  They got in the raid on von Igel&apos;s office a note of mine the tran- script of a message received m cypher from Dublin and wirelessed to Berlin the day before 17th April a request not to land the arms &quot; before  the night of Sunday, 23rd.&quot;  That was its meaning but it used the words &quot; Goods.&quot;  It was at once given to the English and they sent out their patrol boats and caught the ship.  Then they sent troops to  Tralee and reinforced Limerick.     That would not  have spoiled the rising, because if they were in the field  other shiploads would have been sent.  Casement did the rest.  He landed on Friday and sent a message to McNeill to stop it; that it was hopeless, &amp;c.  McNeill got  it,on Saturday and  issued  his countermand.  He got one message up by Monteith, who, of course, was obeying orders, and sent another by a priest,  for whom he sent  after his arrest.  McNeill had only been told of the decision on  Good  Friday which was a great mistake.  He was at first shocked, but on hearing of the  shipload of arms con- sented.  Then the Limerick and Kerry men got word  to him  of the sinking of  the ship, and that, with the request from Roger, decided  him and he issued the  fatal order and took care that it reached everybody.  From our experience of a year of his utter impracticability he had been assuring us, till we were  sick, that &quot; there was no hope for the poor old woman &quot; until the next war we sent with the first note from home that we transmitted to Berlin a request that R. be ashed to remain there. &quot;to take care of  Irish  interests.&quot; We knew  he  would meddle in his  honest, but visionary way  to such an extent as to spoil things, but we did not dream that he would ruin everything as he has done.  He took no notice whatever of decisions or instruc- tions, b^t without quarreling, pursued  his own dreams.  The last letter  I got from him, written last December, said the only hope now of making a demonstration that
 would impress the world was to send the &quot; Brigade &quot; to Egypt.  To impress the world by sending sixty men to a place where they coned do nothing.  We had lold him nearly a year before that we would not consent to this but he took no notice.  He was obsessed with the idea that he was a wonderful leader and that nothing could be done without him.  His letters always kept me awake  on the night of the day I  got them.  Miss R. says he told Dully that the Germans treated Us shamefully and that he had hard work to get the few arms that were on that ship; that they were no  good, &amp;c.  Well, they were good enough for the Russians to overrun East Prussia with and to drive the Austrians across the Carpathians and if  our fellows had got them they&apos;d be able to shoot a good many Englishmen with them.  It is not true that the Germans treated us badly; they did everything we  asked, but they  were weary  of his impracticable dreams and told us  to deal directly with them here.  He had no more to do with getting that shipload than the man in the moon. The request was made from Dublin and we transmitted it from here.  They replied in nine days and the message was sent to Dublin by a girl who had brought out the request.     He told Duly that he wanted to be landed in Galway, to go to Dublin and lay the situation before them that is, to tell  them that Germany was not sincere, &amp;c, and then if they decided to light that he would go out and die with them.. Every note he struck was one of despair. And he told everything to every fellow who called on him. Christensen who &quot; saved &quot; him, is one of  the  worst  crooks  I ever met and was in the pay of the English all along.  He, Casement, was warned of that from Ireland and the first thing he did was to tell the fellow himself and to give  him the name of the man who had warned him.  Christensen was going over from here to testify against him and incidently to give away all our  secrets that he had got from Roger, but we kept him here.     I  don&apos;t want you to tell any  of this I mean about Roger to anyone except Father Yorke, but the rest you can use your judgment  about.     If that countermand had not been issued they could have taken Dublin and the big force that was concentrated on Dublin would have had to be divided up.  They would not have known where to send it for a while and a lot of soldiers would have joined.     Only 1,500 men fought in Dublin and they held up an army of  20,000 or 25,000 Britishers for a whole week.  Only 800 turned out at first; the rest came later, but after Tuesday those who  wanted could not get  near them and were half crazy.  Our fellows had only 103 killed and wounded.  The English had 2,700.     The turn over of the people to our side,  according to  everybody, is astonishing, partly because of the splendid fight and partly  because of  the atrocities, which were very extensive.  The Dublin  priests are collecting evidence about them and will puolish the record.  The conversions to our side  among the priests is the most remark- able thing of all.     We have sent a  good sum of  money for  our work  and it is already there.  We expect to be in direct communication with a reorganised S.C.,  or a partly reorganised- ised one, very soon.     Of course a lot of the future will depend on the course of the war which is now going somewhat against us, but whatever comes, the old Ireland is gone.     The most encouraging thing of all is that there was not one informer.  Hundreds of the men knew the date, but the Government was in the dark until the blow was struck.  There is no doubt at all about this.  Sean  told the girls that he was aston- ished at the utter absence of anything  but the  results  of their shadowing in the testimony of the Dublin dectives.   Not a  word  of inside information.  And he said their testimony was stupid.     I have struck this off  on the typewriter in a desperate hurry, without anv regard to style or sequence, because if I don&apos;t do it  this evening I can&apos;t do it at all, and I tore  one of the pages in taking it out and  had  to paste it. Reidy has  been laid up for the past six weeks from eating bad crabs and I  have been in a frightful mess in con- sequence.  I nearly broke down two or three times.   I have  had Peter Golden helping me for the past three days, and I am  easier  now.  But it was the  hardest ordeal Iever put in because I had  to go out to see the messengers and attend committee meet-ings so often and then resume work, not knowing &quot; where I  was at.&quot;     With the few facts I have given you in your mind you will understand the situa-tion  better.     Kind regards to Mrs. De L. and to Father Yorke.                                                     Yours trulv,                                             (Signed)       JOHN DEVOY.
    Despatch in envelope addressed :        M. H. EISENHUTH,            5, Stationsvej, Gentofte&apos;, Copenhagen.    Pers.s. &quot;Kristianiafjord.&quot;    Pmk. New York, August 23, 1916.    The Bishop of Cork having died, there is a sharp contest over the succession.The present Assistant-Bishop, Daniel Cohalan, is the choice of the local clergy, butEngland is using unusual influence to have-appointed.  -is stronglyanti-German, although  Germany,  at  our request, released  him  shortly  after theoutbreak of war.  He was in Berlin,  taking a course of study, and was  detained.His very first utterance  when arriving in Ireland was a sneer at Germany, and hehas continued that attitude ever since.  Assistant-Bishop Cohalan is cousin of JudgeCohalan,  and strongly  Nationalist and pro-German.   He  was  the intermediary between the  Cork  Volunteers  and the British military authority, and publiclyexposed the gross breach of faith on the part of the English with the  surrenderee-men.   This brought him the hostility of England: hence the effort to defeat himthrough the British envoy at the Vatican.  The appointment of an Irish bishop ismade in Rome.  A list of three names is selected by the local clergy, and the selectionmay be made from that list or a man not mentioned may be appointed.  It wouldhave a great moral effect in Ireland if Cohalan were chosen.  If Germany can exertany influence to bring about this result it would defeat the English intrigue aimedagainst her interests.   Even if Cohalan should not be appointed, the  defeat of-would be the next best thing.Extract from a despatch,  No. 401,  August 26, 1916,  from Washington to Berlin.    I doubt much whether the Bureau of the Military Attache&quot; can be conducted byvon Igel and von Skal as it was in the time of von Papen.  Proceedings are pendingagainst von Igel for being compromised in the Welland Canal enterprise.  As our government adopted the attitude towards the  American Government that von Igeland his papers are immune, he being a member of the Embassy, it is respectfullysubmitted that we  could  not notify the authorities that  he  had left our service.Besides, such a step would  diminish our prestige .... Von Igel and von Skal havealso  conducted,  in  addition to the War Intelligence Centre, the various mattersstarted by von Papen, and have partly settled them. These include the orders givento the Bridgeport  Projectile Company, the Atna  (1 Etna) Powder Company,  thepurchase of chlorine and aluminium, the sale of arms lying to our account in new york and the State of Washington, and intended for India, the dealings in benzol,phenol, and toluol,  the settlement of proceedings such  as  those against Konig,Schwindl, Kunzle, Breitung, Wieperl, and Bode, as well  as the settlement of their claims.   In all these affairs,  as in the time of von Papen, Herr-(the EmbassyCouncillor)  has  been  consulted by von Igel.  In important matters I myself havedecided.    It would be especially difficult to carry on these matters through anyone else, asit would  be quite impossible  to  work him in owing  to  the order to  destroy allcompromising records. ...    Von  Igel and von Skal also keep up relations with the Indians and Irishrespectively since von Papen left.  The consul-general asked  me not to  expose him in this respect to any risk of  being compromised in view of his  instructions from you.For that reason von Papen  took the business on himself and  then transferred it tovon Igel.  Von  Skal maintains  relations with.the Irish,  for which he  has  special qualifications in his  many  relationships  in those  circles, and has their complete confidence.     I should also  observe that the  authorities have in no way interfered with vonIgel since he was  let out  on bail.  I,  therefore, ao not think there is any  risk offurther contretemps ^ from employing von Igel, assuming, of course, that politicaltension does not again revive, but in such an event the authorities would not hesitate to attack any members of  the Embassy, if internal politics rendered it desirable.

No. 352 of  14th July. ^    Igels Report is not  conclusive.  The  betrayal of the Irish undertaking seemsto have resulted, in accordance with  the view taken by the Irish Americans,  from american indiscretions, subsequent to the seizure of Igels papers.    I suggest that you should communicate  by  telegram  positive  proofs, if suchexist, against  (?Wiegand).    Despatch in envelope addressed :                                         ;        M. H.

Irish  leaders  here who have  sent  me  the  following  communication,  have requested that I should lay the proposals before your Excellency, and would be glad to have further  advice.                                                            BERNSTORFF.                                 Enclosure.    4th September, 1916.  (English.)    The Irish Revolution Director resident  in  America respectfully submits thefollowing  memorandum for the consideration of the  German Committee.    A detailed statement of causes of military failure of the recent rebellion inIreland will be furnished later.  But, notwithstanding the failure  in  a  militarysense, the result has been of great essential  benefit, short  of  complete  victory, inIreland, and of the first importance in America.  The entire Irish people are arousedand are now firm in the belief that military success can be achieved if the necessaryarms  and munitions can be  secured.   The sending of a &quot;U&quot; Boat  has convincedthem  of Germany&apos;s good faith,  and the fact that the vessel reached the  Irish coastdemonstrated the power of Germany to help them.  Our forces are reorganised undercapable leaders, and we are now in communication with them.  They are anxious for another attempt on a large scale.   In regard to the recent  statement of theImperial German Government, that it was not discouraged and was willing to helpIreland again, we respectfully submit the following proposal:     Arms can only reach Ireland now by an expedition with a sufficient  military force  to cover the landing.    We ask that as large a quantity  of arms,  munitions  and equipment and asstrong a military  force as the German Government feels it can send,  be  despatched to a point or points, in Ireland, and at a time to be agreed upon,  or  determined bythe German Government.  The  expedition  will  be joined by  a force of partiallytrained but mostly unarmed men who can  be immediately armed and utilised.  Otherforces will cut rail and telegraph communications and delay concentration of Britishtroops.  The number of men available will be limited only by the supply of  arms.    We are assured that an  initial success would bring to the  colours fully 250,000men.    The advantage of having one or more Western Irish ports as submarine baseswe have previously  pointed out, and are so obvious that we need not further  dwellon them.  Galway and Limerick owing to better organisation, would be best. AtFoyhes below Limerick there is  now stored  an enormous quantity  of  petrol.    The same reasoning applies to bases for Zeppelins in Ireland.
    Rapid communication with Ireland is row impossible, but we nave perfected amessenger system which we are confident will meet all emergencies.    A successful landing in Ireland would be a tremendous  blow to England andwould exercise a very considerable effect on the war.    We hope the foregoing will receive serious consideration, and we hope for thefavour of early reply.  End of enclosure.                                  Despatch.

The local Irish leaders, who have given me the following communication asking for a statement that I had submitted  these proposals to your  Excellency, request that further instructions be sent them.                                              (Signed)       BERNSTORFF.    This  enclosure was a  copy of the  proclamation of the  Rebel ProvisionalGovernment issued on the morning of the Easter Week Rebellion, 1916.    It is as follows :-                                              PoUacht na h Eireann,                                         The Provisional Government of the                                                             Irish Republic.To the people of Ireland,    Irishmen and Irishwomen:  In the name of God and of the dead generationsfrom  which she  receives  her old tradition  of &quot;nationhood,  Ireland, through  us,summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.    Having organised  and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionaryorganisations, the Irish Republican Brotherhood,  and through  her open militaryorganisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish  Citizen Army, having patientlyperfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to revealitself, she now seizes that moment and,  supported by her exiled children in Americaand by gallant allies in Europe, but relying first on her own strength, she strikes infull confidence of victory.    We declare the right of the people of  Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, andto the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible.    The long usurpation of that right by  foreign  people and Government hasnot extinguished the right, nor can it ever  be extinguished except by the destructionof the Irish people.  In every generation the  Irish people have asserted their rightto national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the past three hundred yearsthey have asserted  it in arms.    Standing on that fundamental right  and againasserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic,as a Sovereign Independent  State,  and we pledge our  lives, and  the lives of ourcomrades in arms, to the cause of its freedom, of its  welfare, and of its exaltationamong the nations.    The Irish  Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims,  the  allegiance of  everyIrishman and Irishwoman.   The Republic guarantees  religious and civil liberty,equal rights and equal opportunities to all its  citizens, and declares  its resolve to pursue the  happiness and prosperity  of  the whole  nation, and of all  its parts,cherishing  all  children of  the nation equally, and oblivious  of the  differencescarefully fostered by an alien Government, which  have  divided a minority from amajority in the past.    Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of apermanent  National Government,  representative of the whole people of Ireland andelected by  the suffrages of all her  men and  women,  the Provisional Government,hereby constituted,  will administer the civil  and military  affairs  of  the Republicin trust for the people.    We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most HighGod, Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one  who servesthat cause  will dishonour it by cowardice,  inhumanity or rapine.   In this supreme
hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline, and by the readiness of itschildren to sacrifice themselves  for the common good, prove  itself worthy of  the august destiny to which it is called.

SMITH,        1407,  Mass Avenue, Washington.In envelope addressed to :     Z. N. G. OLIFIERS,        121, Keizersgracht, Sloterdyk, Amsterdam.                         From Washington to Berlin.     9th October, 1916.  With reference to telegram 95 of 10th September, I giveherewith an extract from the English blue book containing the evidence before theCommission of Enquiry  into the Rising in Ireland.     The evidence  of Sir  Matthew Nathan, Under-Secretary for Ireland:  &quot;On17th April the General Commanding in Dublin showed the Under-Secretary a letterfrom the Officer Commanding in Queenstown, which told of a contemplated landingfrom a German ship rigged up as a neutral, accompanied by two submarines, of armsand  ammunition on  the coast  for a rising timed for Easter Eve,  Saturday.  Theletter was shown to the Inspector-General of the Royal  Irish Constabulary, andinspectors in S. and S.W. were put on their guard,  and special preparations weremade in Dublin.   On the evening of  21st April,  the County Inspector of Traleereported that some  ammunition, &amp;c, had been found in a boat captured on Saturday,Easter Eve.  On the 22nd it was reported that a  vessel disguised  as a Norwegiansteamer had been stopped off the coast of Kerry, and was being brought into Queens-town when  it hoisted German colours, and  was  blown  up by its crew near the entrance of the harbour.&quot;     Lord Wimborne, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,  evidence: &quot;He said he supposedthe admiral thought nothing of the warning, but had thought it a mere ruse: buthe was told to look out for the ship.  He communicated it to General Stafford, Cork,who sent it  to General  Friend, Dublin.  He said he arrived in Dublin  17th April.The following day the  Under-Secretary showed him  a letter written  by GeneralStafford on  16th April  to General Friend, Dublin,  conveying an  intimation fromthe admiral at Queenstown received 1 through Admiralty,&apos; London, that a ship had left  on the 12th, accompanied by two German submarines,  but he did  not say whereit had left.  He was under the impression that it  was America,  but  clearly it wasnot.  It was due to arrive on the 21st.  The Admiralty did not.communicate that tothe Irish Government.   This was the only warning they  had, other  than facts ofgeneral notoriety.&quot;     I wish to point out to you various points in this evidence worthy of attention,which go to disprove the view generally expressed  that the plan was betrayed fromthe papers seized at von IgeLs rooms.  His arrest took place on 18th April.  Theinformation that the vessel was accompanied by  two submarines and had left on 12thwas never known to us  here.  This must have come from Germany.  The evidenceof the Lord Lieutenant in the last sentence  indicated that the informant had an agent in America who forwarded the intelligence by telegraph to London.

Message addressed:     J. A. WITTIG,        Copenhagen.Pmk. October 25, 1916.Washington, October 24, 1916.    In continuation of report A 468, of October of this year.    The  Irish  leaders here request that  Reserve Captain  Boehm, at  present in(? Rotterdam),  may  be  directed  by his superiors  to  send no further letters toIrishmen here.  His letters only endanger their undertakings, especially as they aresometimes addressed to the wrong people who are only partly (? initiated).    The representative of General Staff, Section 3 B, Political, is probably in touchwith Boehm.                                                               BERNSTORFF.    NOTE. Captain Boehm was arrested in British waters near Falmouth early in1917 and interned. As appears from the &quot; Report, East India (Sedition Committee,1918),  1918,&quot; Cd. 9190, Boehm had been employed by Germany in connection with indian as well as Irish sedition.                                  Despatch.                                             Washington, November 4, 1916.    Among the documents seized in possession of von Igel, who had been notified asa member of this Embassy, have been found papers concerning the Irish question,and also the Wetland Canal.  All my endeavours to get these documents back have failed owing to the obstinate resistance of the authorities.    It would be well to exercise strong pressure with this object in Berlin,  whichmight have the effect of delaying developments in the submarine question.

German Embassy, Washington, to Foreign Office, Berlin.151.    186 of 19th December (1916).    Our Irish  friends here are strongly against the proposed Peace  Conference,which they regard as a desertion of Ireland on  the  part of Germany.    If England were to make her consent  to enter into negotiations dependent onimpossible  preliminary conditions,  a public declaration  on our  part  that  wesupported the principle of Irish autonomy would be very desirable.    As  matters appear on this side, we should gain most advantage if we putDisarmament and a future League of Peace in the forefront as the most importantobjects of the Conference.          /                  ,

It is proposed to laird two lots, each of 30,000 rifles. 10 machine guns, 6,000.000cartridges from two armed merchant vessels at Galway and Tralee on 21st February,or the following days until 25th February.    Should it be impossible for the ships to  arrive between 21st and 25th February,landing between 21st  and 25th March.    In any case, the  ships will enter at second low water.    After the landing, the ships will lay up in the harbours, and will be availablefor .... in view of the small possibility of defence .... English opposition.    Owing to the impossibility of bringing over German landing  troops,  arrange-ments for landing the arms must in the main be the business of the Irish.    Should  there be  any objection to the  harbours chosen, please propose  otherharbours with sufficient water at low tide for ships of five metres draught and withmoderate traffic.    For piloting the ships in, it is proposed to embark pilots for Galway and Traleein Germany.  They should arrive in Berlin by, at the latest, 6th February.    Should  it be impossible  to  embark the pilots in Germany, two pilot vessels should be held in readiness from the 21st to 25th February, respectively off TraleeBay between Kerry Head and Seven Hogs, and in Galway Bay,  west of MargaretaShoal Whistling Buoy, where the pilots will be  transhipped.

In relation to this despatch it may be noted that on the 20th December, 1916.The Executive Council of the Friends of Irish Freedom at Boston adopted resolutiondemanding that the  German Government should declare its position with regard toIreland&apos;s claim for independence,  and asking that  Germany accord to Ireland  thesame treatment as that given  to Poland.    The  preamble was as follows:         &quot;Whereas  the Gorman Government in its peace proposals have  made no    mention nor demand for the freedom of Ireland, we claim that Ireland  has fully    established her  right to be regarded as an  ally of  Germany, and we  ask that    Germany  shall  recognise this  claim and that  she   protect  Ireland  and    guarantee her freedom as  she  is determined to protect  her other allies.&quot;
                      German Envoy&apos;s Message to Berlin.                                            &quot; Washington, January  22,1917.    &quot; I request authority to pay out up to $50,000 in order, as on former occasions,to influence Congress through tne organisation you know, which can perhaps preventwar.    &quot; I am beginning in the meantime to act accordingly.    &quot; In the above circumstances a public German  official declaration in favour ofIreland is highly desirable in order to gain the support of Irish influence here.                                                      &apos;  &quot; BERNSTORFF.&quot;    In a speech to the John Mitchell  Clan-na-Gael Club reported in the &quot; Gaelic-American,&quot; the  organ  of the Clan-na-Gael, edited by Devoy, for 9th December, 1916,Kuno Meyer said Germany was&quot; building hundreds of submarines which in due coursewould put  a ring round  England.  &quot; When that day  arrives it might even  bestrategical,  I think, to land  in  Ireland and from that island to attack Great Britain.Whether  that is so or not, the day  will then be nearer .... when the first step willbe taken  to free  Ireland and make her a Republic.  The last news that 1 had showsclearly that  what  Germany  has  clone for  Poland, to free Poland as far as the  presentcircumstances of politics and military considerations allow it, is also her object withregard to Ireland .  . .  .&quot;    On  18th  January, 1917,  the official Sinn  Fein  organisation  in  Americawas launched at the office of the Friends of Irish Freedom at No. 26, Cortlandt Street,New York  City.   Among the officers chosen  to act  on behalf of the revolutionaryprogramme  of  Sinn  Fein  were Jeremiah A.  0&apos;Leary,  John J. 0&apos;Leary, PeterGolden, Captain Monteith, Stephen W. Johnson, Dennis Spellissy, John D. Mooreand James Larkin.    Shortly prior to  this,  arrangements  were  made  for sending pamphlets andother written matter  to Ireland through  the medium of Fritz Platen, of  Zurich,Switzerland, who was to send on the papers to Dublin, either by post or messenger.Various  secret  lines of communication between Ireland, Germany and the  UnitedStates were developed by John Devoy and his associates on behalf of the Clan-na-Gaeland its affiliated interests.    In addition to Mellowes, various other emissaries were sent to America by SinnFein leaders in Ireland, including two sisters-in-law of certain of the Irish  revolu-tionists who were executed in the rebellion of 1916.  These emissaries were used bythe Friends of  Irish Freedom to make speeches and otherwise do organising workand  the  active  work of Sinn Fein  in America  through  the  Clan-na-Gael and theFriends of Irish Freedom in raising funds to arm and equip the Irish volunteers for the purpose of instituting a new revolution in Ireland,  was continued  duringthe year  1917.  Numerous meetings were held at which speeches were made, among others, by the &quot; Ambassador &quot; of the Irish Volunteers, Patrick McCartan.     On 28th January, 1917, Kuno Meyer  lectured before a branch of the Friends of irish Freedom in Los  Angeles, California.     In the summer of 1917, the leaders of the Sinn Fein movement  in Ireland hadcommissioned Patrick McCartan, who had fled to the United  States, as the envoyof the &quot; Provisional Government of Ireland,&quot; in order to promote the spread of the sinn Fein propaganda among the Irish^Americans.     He got into connection with John Devoy and the Clan-na-Gael, and plans weremade for fomenting a new rebellion in Ireland with the assistance of Germany, andwith this object it was arranged that McCartan should  go to Stockholm to  consultAttached to a message of 18th January, 1917, passed through by State Department.Number 215.

with emissaries of the German Government.   It was also arranged that Mellowesshould subsequently go to Ireland.    Patrick McCartan obtained a  false passport, with which he secured a passageon  the  Atlantic  transport  &quot;Maumee.&quot;   A  short  time  afterwards,  about22nd  October,  1917, Liam  Mellowes, together with Dr. Max von Recklinghausen,a German subject, were arrested in New York by the United States Secret Service.Among Mellowes&apos; effects  seizsd by the Secret Service  was  a letter reading asfollows:     &quot; My dear Mr. D.,         &quot; I would like to be remembered to the Judge and to my friend Joseph from    Philadelphia.  Give them, as  well  as the boys in  the office, my kind  regards.    Every conceivable kind of intimidation is being resorted to to enaeavour to make    our lads prove unfaithful to their  principles, but in  spite of all the influences    they are standing up like men.&quot;    The &quot;Mr. D.&quot; referred to in said  letter is John Devoy,  the &quot;Judge&quot;  referredto in said letter is Judge Cohalan,  and  the &quot;my friend Joseph from Philadelphia&quot;is Joseph McGarrity of Philadelphia.    Liam Mellowes,  when arrested, had in his possession a false passport made outin the name of Patrick Donnelly, and Patrick McCartan was  then,  as  above stated,on his way to Halifax on the steamship  &quot; Maumee,&quot; sailing on a fraudulent passportissued  in the name of Francisco Conlin.  McCartan was retained in America, and both McCartan and Mellowes. were charged  by the  United  States  with  havingsecured the issuing of  fraudulent passports.    Prior to the arrest  of  Mellowes heand Patrick  McCartan had conferences with officials  of the Hamburg-AmericanLine in Hoboken  and New York, and Dr. Recklinghausen, an agent and emissaryof the German Government.     On 3rd  February 1917 diplomatic relations between  the  United States andGermany  were broken off  and Count von Bernstorff, the  German  Ambassador atWashington was handed his passports.     On 4th and 5th February, 1917, a National Conference of 1,200 delegates of thevarious Irish national organisations  was held in New  York, over  100,000 dollarswere pledged to  the cause of complete national independence of  Ireland, JudgeCohalan was elected chairman of  this  convention,  and  Jeremiah  A.  0&apos;Leary,secretary.  A  special feature of the conference was the reception of a number of the rebels who had fought in the Easter-week Rebellion.  The meeting was addressed byJohn Devoy,  Liam Mellowes (who had been leader  of the rebellion  at Galway butescaped to America), and by Monteith who, as above stated, had landed in Kerry withCasement from the German Submarine on 21st April, 1916 and who had also escapedto America.  Part of the declaration passed at the meeting was as follows:         &quot; lighting for the success of the Allies would be fighting for  the.combined     subjection of Ireland,  India  and Egypt to English rule.  It would be a war     against Ireland as well as against Germany, and keep Ireland, whose sons fought     for America in their war, under the heel of England.&quot;     Early in  February 1917 His Majesty&apos;s Government received  information that theGermans intended  to  attempt  a further landing of arms  in Ireland between the 21stand 25th February.  The places selected were to be  in the neighbourhood of Galwayand  Tralee.&apos;   The  consignment  of arms was  to  consist  of about  60,000 rifles,10 machine guns and 6,000,000 cartridges.  Adequate arrangements were made, andthe consignments did not reach Ireland.     In anticipation that Germany would be  victorious, the  Executive  of Sinn Feinprepared in 1917 a statement of &quot;Ireiand&apos;s Case for a Peace  Conference,&quot; claimingsovereign independence, and demanding from the Powers  to&apos; be assembled that &quot; thatsovereignty be now recognised and established under their security.&quot;     A full copy in type of this &quot; Case &quot; was seized on the  18th May, 1918, at the SinnFein offices, 6, Harcourt  Street, Dublin.  It was an extremely  voluminous document.Extracts from portions of it are printed in Appendix C, from which its purport can      [o056l                                                        E 2
be gathered.  The Sinn Fein official organ, &quot;Nationality,&quot; on the 3rd March, 1917,announced:         &quot;Mr. Darrell Figgis was engaged with others  last  week in discussing the    statement of  Ireland&apos;s case to be hereafter submitted to the  Peace  Conference.    He was arrested in the midst.of this work and deported to England.&quot;    Arthur Griffiths stated on the Hist March, 1918, at Foxford, Co. Mayo,  to a largely-attended meeting  of Sinn Fein, that copies of the claim of Ireland had been acceptedby all the neutral and Central Powers.  (See &quot; Irishman,&quot; April 0, 1918.)    When America entered  the war on the 4th April, 1917, Professor Kuno Meyerreturned to  Germany,  and; with St. John Gaftney and George Chatterton-Hill-asoi-disant Irishman born in Madras, educated  at  Geneva,  and resident for manyyears in Germany-founded the German-Irish Society,  which had its headquarters in the same premises at Budapester Strasse 14, Berlin,  as those used by the OfficialGerman Press  Bureau.  The  presidents of the organisation  were Herr MathiasErzberger, Baron von Reiohthofen, and Count von Westarp.   On the directorate wereKuno  Meyer, Professor Edward Meyer of Berlin University,  his brother,  KarlGoldschmidt  of Essen, connected with Krupps, Professor Schiemann, and many othereminent men in Germany.  The organ of the Association was  &quot; Irische Blatter,&quot; a monthly review, edited by Chatterton-Hill.  It was devoted to pressing the Sinn Feinprogramme in  Germany and neutral European States and it encouraged Indian aswell as Irish sedition.  The society started with  messages hoping for its  successfrom  General Ludendortr and Herr Zimmermann, then Foreign Secretary, and  it received a congratulatory message from the Kaiser.  The membership of the societywas large and  influential, and it maintained touch with the Sinn Fein leaders inIreland and  America.     The following is from  the inaugural address  of the German-Irish Society :-     &quot; The war has proved that Germany has very few  friends.  But the Irish haveacted  as friends  at home as well as in the United States,  and Germany must notunderestimate  the value of  Irish friendship.  From the beginning of  the war theAmerican-Irish adopted the German cause with enthusiasm,  and,  in alliance withthe German-Americans, conducted  a courageous fight  for  true  neutrality.   Thereis no  doubt  that, but for  the support of the  Irish organisations, the politicallyunorganised  German-Americans would have been condemned to impotence.     &quot; The formation of this society is to supply visible  proof to the Irish in ireland as  well as in America of  German gratitude and German sympathy.  The heroicrebellion of  1916 still  lives  in the memory of all of us. . .  .     &quot;The German-Irish Society will  devote its  energies to reopening Ireland  tothe world, and especially to  Germany.  It will see that  the voice of the  Irish nation,which has been oppressed and sucked dry  by England, again  finds expression, and generally and  in every way further the progressive development of  the EmeraldIsle in the interest of the German as well as the Irish people.&quot;     The first numbers contained a full account of the Irish Easter week rebellion with illustrations of the leaders.   The  following is a quotation  from one  of thearticles :     &quot; When, the  west Irish harbours serve as bases for U-boats, and  a large partof  the country is in the hands of one of the organised revolutionary  armies, thenwill England&apos;s rule over the sea quickly come to an end.  Not only can many Englishships carrying munitions and the necessaries of life be sunk, but they can be capturedand towed into Irish ports in order to supply the Irish army with munitions and the Irish people with food.  Thus would England be handed over to her  enemies and the war quickly brought to an end.  The setting free of Ireland from England would be  the end of  England&apos;s world dominion and of English rule over the seas.  Both of  these depend entirely upon whether England remains in possession of  Ireland.     &quot;By the  employment  of efficient German methods o/f  education,  industrial organisation and military  training Ireland would soon become self-reliant.  The path of unhindered development of their natural gifts would be thrown open to the Irish people, gifts now stifled and repressed by the annihilating power of English rule.     &quot; But this result cannot be brought about without a struggle.  Ireland must secure her independence by the bravery of her men and the support of her women. &apos; He who will be free himself must  draw the sword.&apos;  Ireland cannot  accept her
freedom as a present from the hand of another nation.  The Irish, not the Germans,must drive the English army from Ireland and leave behind as an example to cominggenerations memorials of their fame and glorious traditions of the heroic struggle.    &quot; Germany will help gladly.  . .  .  Every Power which wars with  England isby that act the ally of Ireland; every sword-thrust made against England, no matter by whom, is a sword-thrust for the freedom of humanity.    &quot; Ireland  cannot fight  without weapons and war material;  and these absolutelyindispensable  things must  be procured wherever they are to be had.  But withoutmoney that is  impossible impossible without a great deal of money.   From whenceis this money to come 1  The Irish in America could raise it in the course  of a month,if they  had the confidence given by the  prospect of  the result and faith in the integrity and  activity of the men, sufficient  to interest themselves in  the matter.    &quot;Every man and every woman who desires the freedom of Ireland  must striveto arouse this mutual confidence.  That is at the  present  time the essential, theindispensable  thing.  When that is attained,  the  way  is made clear.&quot; IrischeBlatter, May 1917, p, 102.    On  the 18th June,  1917, all  the Sinn Fein prisoners who had been incarceratedafter the rebellion, and  several of whom, including De Valera, had been sentenced to death, but  had their sentences commuted  to penal servitude, were released on fullamnesty.    On  the day of  their  release, the 18th. June, 1917, they sent the following message to President Wilson and  the Congress of the United States.    This address was presented on the 23rd  July, 1917, by Dr. Patrick McCartan, the sinn Fein  &quot;Ambassador,&quot;  who had fled from Ireland after the rebellion and escapedto America.  Dr. McCartan  was subsequently elected M.P. for Kings County.I o the President and Congress        of the United States.Gentlemen,                                             Dublin, June 18, 1917.    Yv e, the undersigned,  who have been held in English prisons, and have beendragged from dungeon to dungeon, in heavy chains, cut off since Easter Week, 1916,from all intercourse with the outside world, have just had an opportunity of seeing the printed text of the message of the United States of America to the ProvisionalGovernment of Russia.    We see that the President accepts as the aim of both countries &quot; the carrying ofthe present struggle for the freedom of all peoples to a successful consummation.&quot;We also see that the object of President Wilson&apos;s own Government is &quot; the liberation of peoples everywhere from the aggressions of autocratic force.&quot; &quot; We are fighting,&quot;writes  the President to the Government of Russia,  &quot; for the liberty, self-governmentand undictated development of all peoples,  and every feature of the settlement thatconcludes this war must be conceived and executed for that purpose.   Wrongs must first be righted and then adequate safeguards must be created to prevent their beingcommitted again.  Remedies must be found as well as statements of principle thatwill have  a  pleasing  and sonorous sound.&quot;  &quot; No people must  be  forced under asovereignty under which it does not wish to live.&quot;    We trust that such  remedies in preference  to any governmental professionswhatsoever will be held to include the right of each people, not merely to rely on other peoples to support  their claim to national liberty, but what the governments and peoples of other  nations will, we trust,  regard  as  even more sacred the rightof each people to defend itself against external aggression, external interference and external control.  It is this particular right that we claim for the Irish people,  andnot content  with statements of principle, though  these themselves may  be made a pretext for  our oppression, we are engaged  and mean to engage ourselves in thepractical means for establishing this right.    Without awaiting the issue of the war or the settlement that may conclude thewar, we ask of the Government of the United States of America, and the Govern-ments  of the free peoples of the world, to take immediate measures to inform them-selves accurately and on the spot about the extent of liberty or attempted repressionwhich  we may encounter.

The Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, which existed before the Revo-lution of 1916 and continues to exist, desires to convey to the Government and peopleof the United States the appreciation by the Irish people of the principles enunciatedin President Wilson&apos;s communication to the new Government of Russia.  Our peopleinterpret that statement, in effect, as a declaration of independence for all oppressednations.    While we are convinced that Ireland must rely primarily upon the people of ireland to re-establish our independence, thus securing for ourselves undictated developmentof our civilisation and culture, we welcome moral or material assistance from friends of liberty everywhere.  We rejoice particularly at encouragement from your greatRepublic,  which by  its example has given hope and inspiration to enslaved peoplesall over the world,. Since the days of Washington our people have looked to america as the champion of universal freedom and the cradle of democracy.  They have, there-fore, ever been as jealous of its honour and glory as its own citizens.    Since the first days of your independence  there has been a constant friendshipbetween the two countries which has been intensified by the influx of Irishmen to theUnited States, where they fully enjoyed the blessings of liberty.   During your greatstruggle to shake off the same tyranny under which we have been forced to live, weglory in the fact  that  the patriot cause was actively  and enthusiastically supportedby all Irishmen in America and that it had the moral support of the Irish peopleat home.  The resolutions of thanks for this support, which were amongst the firstacts of Congress,  demonstrated that the assistance and encouragement thus renderedwere appreciated by the fathers of your republic.  We need not dwell  on the extentto which our kinsmen  contributed to the building up of the United States, and their readiness  at all times  to defend its integrity and honour. Apart from the general principles of universal liberty, we believe we have reason to expect assistance from your great country in fighting the same battle against the same foe as Washingtonfought.    In President Wilson&apos;s communication to the Russian Government he states that&quot; no people must be forced under a sovereignty under which it does not wish to live.&quot;Ireland does  not  wish to live under the sovereignty  of England,  and  of course thePresident^ general  statement includes the particular case of Ireland.    The struggle to regain our independence is practically unique in the history ofthe world. It  has  been  steadily  maintained  for seven  hundred and  fifty yearsand our right to  freedom asserted by arms in nearly every generation during  thatperiod.  No measures  of our foreign rulers, whether bribes, gibbets or partial exter-mination,  could destroy in our people the yearning for liberty.  To-day the spirit ofpatriotism is more general and more intense than at any  time since the world wasintoxicated with  the principles of democracy  by  the noble example of the UnitedStates in 1776.    England never lost  an opportunity to slander our nation, as she slanders allenemies.   We are described by her agents in the press, on the stage and in novels asbigots and drunken savages which she has been unable to civilise. At present sheassures the world that she  is even anxious, to grant  Ireland self-government if theIrish would  only agree among  themselves.  This  is  merely  a subterfuge.   Wedisagree no more than other peoples. America, when fighting for independence, hadher Tories who were comparatively much more numerous than the same  type is inIreland to-day.
     Though the American people are fairly well informed concerning Irish aspira- tions, we take advantage of this opportunity to briefly outline present conditions here and the events which led up to them.  English statesmen have ever been ready to make promises when such would tend to further English policy.  The leader of the late Liberal Government, on assuming control, therefore promised Home Rule to Ireland. With this promise to dangle before Irish-Americans he then sent his Irish henchmen to the United States to aid in furthering England&apos;s foreign policy there.  As they failed miserably, and the war cloud already on the horizon became larger and more threatening, it was necessary to pretend to carry out the promises.  The 11 hypocritical sham &quot; on the Statute Book was therefore submitted to Parliament, but it was never intended to put it into operation.  Irish Unionists were encouraged  and financed by the Royal Family and aristocracy of  England to threaten civil war rather than submit to home government.  It was thus hoped to create an excuse for withdrawing the Bill, dwarf though it was, when England&apos;s policy no longer required its presence on the political stage.     This English conspiracy against Ireland  was  a boomerang which, but for the baneful influence  of  John  Redmond  and his colleagues, would have made  Irish independence as secure  as  Washington&apos;s  victory  at  Yorktown made  American independence.  The result of it all is that England is now straining every nerve to conclude a separate peace with Ireland.  She proposes a convention to smooth out the differences previously created by her agents and general policy; also in the hope of discovering the minimum Ireland could be induced  to accept, for nobody would now tolerate the Act on the Statute Book.     The Republicans, who form a majority of the people,  were invited to send dele- gates, but would only be allowed the same representation as the Southern Unionists. They replied that they would take part if all delegates were elected by the people and if England promised to abide by the decisions of such an elected convention. England dare not trust the Irish people, and hence the Republicans will ignore the packed convention.     This, however, will not prevent English statesmen  from trying to  get  other nations to regard the Irish question as a domestic  instead of  an international one. Their contention will probably be that the Republicans only represent a small section, or that the convention was the means of  reconciling the majority of the people to a belief in English justice.     We submit that the Republicans represent the vast majority of the people and there is nothing new in  their demand.   It is the same  now as when Hugh 0&apos;NeilI went to Spain, or Wolfe  Tone went to France for  assistance.   The following facts should help  to make our contention clear  to the world :      1. Count Plunkett was elected to  represent  a Parliamentary constituency by a large majority on  a purely republican platform.     2. Mr. McGuinness, while in penal servitude for taking part in the revolution, was  elected on a similar platform.     3. By the time this note reaches you Professor de Valera,  whom public opinion in America saved from the same fate as Pearse, and who has just been released from prison,  will be elected on the  same ticket to the  vacancy created by the death of Mr.  W. Redmond, who  died  fighting for England.     These men, elected in constituencies widely separated,  thus proving the demand for  a republic is universal, do not recognise the right of the English Parliament to legislate for Ireland, and hence will not attend that institution.     4.  Mr. Ginnell, already a Member of Parliament, will  withdraw when requested by the  Republicans, and his constituency  will endorse his action.     5.  Ireland is at present ruled by martial law, and garrisoned by over  60,000 of England&apos;s  best  soldiers,  besides 10,000  military  police, though  the people are practically unarmed.     6.  There  are in Ireland over  300,000 men  available  for  military service  whoabsolutely refuse to fight for  England,  and she dare not attempt to force them.     7.  If these facts are not sufficiently convincing, the Provisional Government is willing to submit the issue to a plebiscite on a franchise similar to that prevailing in the  United States, on  condition that  it be superintended by representatives ofthe American and Russian Governments.   There is  no doubt that the result of sucha plebiscite  would be at least a two-thirds majority in favour of the republic, andshould convince all votaries of liberty that Ireland does not wish to live under the sovereignty of England.     We freely admit that many Irishmen are in the English army.  This is due to
poverty resulting from the economic laws imposed on us by England, for the benefitof England and to a mistaken idea of nationalism.   Many people believed that itwas essential to first secure some form of self-government which might&apos; be used tofurther the  establishment of a republic.    They therefore  believed in placatingEngland.   The Irish Party fostered belief  in this fallacy until  they thought thepeople were sufficiently weaned from the republican ideals.  This, with the prestigecreated by Parnell, was the secret  of their  influence  until the great mass of thepeople realised that it was intended to accept nominal self-government as a substitute for a republic, instead of a means of securing a republic.    With confidence we look  for and invite  the active support of the Governmentand  people  of  the  United  States  in  our  demand  for absolute  independence.Advocacy of anything less, as  some Americans, at the invitation of Lord Northclifte,an inveterate enemy of Ireland, have already indulged in, only  injures our causeand is insulting to our country.    Our nationalism is not founded upon grievances,  and a people nurtured fromchildhood on the principles enunciated in the Declaration of American Independenceshould have  no  difficulty in understanding our demands.   We are opposed, not toEnglish misgovernment, but to English government of  Ireland.    We have no doubts about the good-will of the American Government and people;and while prepared when the opportunity arises  to assert our independence by theone force which demands universal respect, and to accept aid from any quarter tothat end, we hope Americans will see their way to aid in doing for Ireland what theydid for Cuba.   We feel that they will insist upon repaying to Ireland the sacrificesand contributions made by her sons  in the cause of America.    Signed on behalf of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic.                                         PATRICK McCARTAN, F.R.C.S.    On America&apos;s entry into the war, the line of  communication between the GermanGovernment and the leaders  of  the  Sinn  Feiners was temporarily broken, thoughthe messenger service devised by John Devoy between the revolutionaries in Americaand Ireland was maintained.    The following is given as an example of one of these channels of communication.This particular letter was taken from  Thomas  Walsh alias  Cain, a  messenger ofthe Clan-na-Gael, arrested  on  the 3rd  November, 1917.   Walsh had heen sailingregularly backwards and forwards between New  York and Liverpool in the  &quot; Baltic,&quot;&quot; Celtic,&quot; &quot; Lapland&quot; and other liners during the year 1917.  The name of the senderand intended recipient of the letter are not disclosed.                               Copy of  Letter.    &quot; Your very welcome letter to hand a few days ago.  I was pleased to learn thatyou gave my friend  Mr. M. such a nice time,  and I  have no doubt but  you were well repaid in the amount of news that you received while he was amongst you.  Ihad expected M. W.  in this week, and for that reason delayed writing this untilnow, but, as there are no signs of his  coming, I am sending this by an old friendwhom  you  have already met.  On the  same boat with him,  if all is well, anotherfriend of mine will travel.  He was out with you last year for a few days, and manyof you thought he was a priest.  When you see him you will think the same, but when you know him as well as I do you will change your mind.  Ask him.  He wasone of the young men who were in G. with Liam last year, and I have no doubt butthe three travellers who reached your place last week will have prepared you for hiscoming.  He will have  some news to relate relative to the matter about which M.spoke.  I am enclosing a letter for M. which I want you to send to him at once, andit must not be posted.  A few days delay will not matter, but see that it does not go beyond that.  The note is for M. from myself.  I read  with some  impatience the news that letters were reaching your side from here without  our knowledge.  I hada long chat with the Seanfear on the matter, and we  decided that some steps mustbe taken to put a stop to it.  We had  a lot of trouble some months ago  about thesame matter and believed that we had  rid ourselves of it.     &quot; These letters are a nuisance and have not left here  known to us.     &quot; Under the Seanfear&apos;s orders no letters must be carried  without my permission,and in future do not send any letters  through  without some initial  appears on it,
either mine or the Seanfear&apos;s.  You should appoint at your side one man to  take charge of that particular department, and no letter should be allowed to pass unless he consents to it.  I have already told my men here that on no account are they toaccept messages unless we are told of them.  All letters are censored, and in a recentlot that L. and myself glanced at there was enough evidence to convict the bearer,the sender, and intended recipient.  In the case of the first mentioned, his name and position on the ship was mentioned.  We told him about the letter, and I am sure inthe future he will be more careful.  I am glad that you intend to censor messagesnot sent  officially.  However, there are certain exceptions.   Lately messages  havearrived here from the lady who was recently released.  These are all right becausethey all are shown to the Seanfear.  However,  there will be no necessity to mentionany of the exceptions here if the men are told  to deliver  the letters to me.  This isnot a wish of my own, but is an order from the  S.  I will be pleased to learn in  yournext letter  that this matter  has  been  attended to,  and I have no doubt but theSeanfear will be also glad because  he was very angry when I told him about thematter.  Your friend Tommy C. C. has just &apos;phoned up; he came in this morning.I am giving the bearer 60 dollars fifty of this must be sent to Mrs. Cuman at thefirst opportunity.  With the other  10 dollars  I want you to buy some of the  tar abrooches, the same as the one you sent Mrs. C.  Half the girls here have (obliterated)annoyed  since they saw it and L. and myself (obliterated) some to one or two  veryparticular friends who have (obliterated) more than good to us during  the tryingtimes of  the past few months.     &quot; The Women&apos;s Society here want to know if it would be possible to have a supplysent out here.  They will guarantee the sum of  100.  Find out particulars and let me know.   Any profit from the  sale will be handed over to the Arms Fund.  TellMrs.    that her sister is quite safe and happy.  I will  send her home to her  very soon, but meanwhile you can assure her that she need have no fears at all about-s welfare.   He is in very good  hands.   He was not too well a few weeks back,but a few days in bed soon put him right.  I am also  giving-bearer some copies ofthe paper, some for you, some for D. which must be sent there in good condition,and some for the other lads.  Try and let me have the papers from your side in regular order and not in any old style as they have been coming of late.  Enclosedalso some letters from the lads.   I have very little time for writing these  days.   Myfriend L. starts work to-morrow  morning, and I  hope to get the man from Tyronea place next week.  I will surely let you have a long letter by the next man, probablyN. W.  The contents of this letter must not be shown to anvone but to those who met and spoke to Mr. M.  That is that  part of the contents referring to L.,  &amp;c.   read the letter to anyone you like, keeping to yourself the matters mentioned.  See thatthis is done. I will give you more definite news about  it all next time, but the man who will reach you on this ship will be able to tell you much.  When he was with youhis name was William Cain.  I am quite well,  and the lads, as you will see from theletter, are also doing well.  I am going to see them probably next week.   Be carefulin your letters to them through the  mail never to  mention the fact  that I am out of town.  There are letters censored locally here, and, as I have four or five aliases andaddresses in this city, the less you say about my absence from town when writing tothem the better.   Be careful also what initials you use when referring to people orthings.  The game now is so high and there is too much at  stake to take any risks,and you must  use extreme  caution when writing.   Always refer in future to theSeanfear, as I do, and  if possible do not mention his name at all.   Well, good-bye.Remember me to all and see to it that any requests made herein are attended  to assoon as possible.&quot;     Very shortly after  the  release of the Sinn  Fein rebel leaders  in  June 1917  the communications, which as above stated  had been interrupted when  America declared war, were again opened between Germany and Sinn Fein.     The  clue was picked up, and the  line of  transmission planned by Germany forgetting into correspondence with the  Sinn  Fein element  in  Ireland through  SouthAmerica and the Irish  in the United States was  commanded.  Some of the messagesare now disclosed.              Foreign Office, Berlin, to German Embassy, Madrid.                                                                     17.8.17.

You  should  also discuss with  the  person in question  the  establishing  of communications with the Sinn Feiners in Ireland from South America, and, if need be,  through the Irish in the  U.S.A.;  the  object of the communications being  thesupport of the Sinn Feiners with arms and munitions for a rising against England.    After the establishing  of communications,  the  first steps to take would be  toorganise the smuggling  of arms, &amp;c, from South  America  and the  U.S.A.  intoIreland.   An undertaking  of  this nature must not  be made  from Spain.   In  thesecond place, the question  arises of sending arms from Germany by the  &quot; Mowe &quot;or submarine in the event  of its being possible to fix a place and time for landingthem in good time.    There is,no question whatever of landing German troops in Ireland.

With reference to No. 18632.              German Embassy, Madrid, to Foreign Office, Berlin.                                                                     28.8.17.    The individual in question  will endeavour to get into  communication with  the sinn Feiners in Ireland, either through the readers of the Irish papers published inBuenos Aires or directly through North America.    I am  seeking through Spanish  clerics for a suitable priest whom I can send tohim.    Arms and munitions are only procurable  in South America in the event of being able to secure the cargo of the s.s. &quot; Muansa,&quot; belonging to the East Africa Line, andlikewise cargo space,  only  if  the  Hamburg-South American  Line can  induce  theArgentine Company, whom they control, to place a ship at our disposal.

Please do not carry out any attacks on Argentine soil.&quot;     While  these  communications   were  passing  with  a  view  to  establishingcommunications between  Sinn  Fein and  Berlin, the  following events occurred inIreland.     A great Sinn  Fein Convention was held in the Mansion House, Dublin, on the26th and 27th October, 1917.   De Valera  was appointed president,  Arthur Griffithvice-president two treasurers were named and Austin Stack  and  Darrel  Figgishonorary secretaries of the new Sinn Fein  organisation.   Professor Eoin  McNeill andtwenty-three others were appointed  an executive committee.  After his election de valera addressed the Convention and stated : &quot; The constitution of the new movementwhich  you have adopted  says this  organisation  of  Sinn Fein aims at securing theinternational recognition of Ireland as an independent Irish Republic.&quot;     A resolution was passed that          &quot; All national activities  be  sub-divided  into clearly defined departments, as     follows:          &quot; 1. Department of Military Organisation ;         &quot; 2. Department of Political Organisation ;         &quot; 3. Department of Education and Propaganda ;         &quot;4. Department of Foreign Relations ;         &quot; 5. Department of Finance.&quot;     and  specified six other  departments dealing with  other matters.     A precis  of the Sinn  Fein Constitution  was circulated in small booklet form,printed in Irish and English, for  the  purpose of enrolling membership.  The following are excerpts from the booklet:                                &quot; CUMANN SINN FEIN.                                   &quot; CONSTITUTION.         &quot; Whereas the people of Ireland never relinquished the claim to  separate     Nationhood, and         &quot; Whereas the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, Easter, 1916,     in the name of the Irish people  and continuing the fight made  by  previous     generations, re-asserted the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to Sovereign     Independence, and re-affirmed the determination of the Irish people to achieve     it: and         &quot; Whereas the Proclamation of  an Irish Republic,  Easter,  1916,  and the     supreme courage  and glorious sacrifices of the men who gave  their lives to     maintain it, have united the people of Ireland under  the flag of the Irish     Republic, be it  Resolved, that  we, the delegated  representatives of the Irish     people, in  Convention  assembled, hereby  declare  the  following  to be  the     Constitution of  Sinn Fein :          &quot; 1. The name of  this organisation shall be Sinn Fein.         &quot; 2. Sinn Fein aims at securing  the International recognition of Ireland     as an independent Irish Republic.      [5056]                                                          F  2    Whether arms, &amp;c, and ships can be obtained in the U.S.A.  will be  ascertained.The individual in  question is  of the opinion that even now transport of munitionsfrom Germany should be prepared.    He would like to  know  where Robert Monteith is at the present time,  who waspromised him from Berlin, and if he is  to  carry out  attacks on warehouses, &amp;e., onArgentine soil.
        &quot; Having achieved that status the Irish people may by referendum freely            choose their own form of Government.        &quot; 3. This  object shall  be attained through the Sinn Fein Organisation    which shall, in the name of the Sovereign Irish people :-        &quot;(a.) Deny the right and oppose the  will of the British Parliament and              British  Crown  or  any other foreign government to legislate  for              Ireland:        &quot; (&amp;.)  Make  use of any and every means available to render impotent the              power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or              otherwise.        &quot; 4. Whereas no law made without the authority and consent  of the Irish    people is or ever  can be binding on their conscience.        &quot; Therefore  in accordance with the Resolution of  Sinn Fein adopted in            Convention,  1905,  a  Constituent  Assembly  shall  be  convoked,            comprising persons chosen by the Irish Constituencies as  the supreme            National authority to speak and act in the name of the  Irish people            and to  devise and formulate measures for the welfare of  the  whole            people of  Ireland.                    &quot; EXTRACT FROM SCHEME OF ORGANISATION.        &quot; The  Sinn Fein  organisation shall  include a  President,  two  Vice-    Presidents, two Hon. Secretaries, two Hon. Treasurers, four National Trustees,    an  annual  Ard-Fheis, an Ard-Ch6mhairle  (with its  standing committee),    comhairle ceanntair and cumainn.        &quot;Membership shall be open  to all adults of  Irish  birth or  parentage,    irrespective of sex, class, or creed, who accept the constitution of  Sinn Fein-    save that no member of the British armed forces, nor pensioner thereof, nor    any person who has taken an oath of allegiance to the British Government shall    be eligible so long as he retains the office or position involving that  oath.&quot;    After the great public meeting of the Sinn Fein Convention on the  27th October,1917, in the Mansion  House,  a very large number of  delegates adjourned  to aConvention of Irish volunteers, which was held in a large store in Dublin on the same day, for the purpose of organising that body more fully.  De Valera  addressed theassembled volunteers, and in the course of his address he said :          &quot;By  proper organisation and recruiting they could have 500,000 fighting-     volunteers  in  Ireland.   That would be a big army, but,  without the  opportunity     and the means of fighting, it could only be used as a menace.  There  had already     been too much bloodshed without success, and he would  never advocate  another     rebellion without hopeful chances of  success.   They could see no hope of that in     the near future,  except through a German invasion of England and the  landing     of troops  and munitions in  Ireland.   They should  be prepared to  leave nothing     undone towards that end.&quot;     He further said :          &quot; That there   never   would  be  peace  in Ireland  until  they got  their     independence.   When  the  war was over England would  be tottering.   The Allies     could  not  win.   All nations at the Peace  Conference would claim  their  right     to the  Freedom of the  Seas, and Ireland was of  such international  importance in     that respect that her claim must be admitted.  They wanted an army to back up     their claim ....   It was intended the  volunteer organisation should  be a     distinct body as regards  control,  finance,  &amp;c, but it would be part  of the Sinn     Fein organisation in its fight for freedom.         &quot; Should the  war end immediately, and  their case not be considered by the     Allied  nations, they would  carry on the fight, and  what  they could  not procure     now, they could get after  the war.   They wanted  an army and  they would     have it.&quot;
    In  Appendix  A (I) is  printed  a  &quot;Memorandum  on Irish  Army Organisation&quot;found in possession of  De Valera when he  was arrested  on 17th May, 1918. - Themanuscript is in De  Valera&apos;s own handwriting.  It shows  the scheme of military organisation of  the Irish Republican Army as designed originally by De Valera.    In November 1917 the following communications were made to Berlin : To Berlin.                                                              6.11.17.    The person in question requests that the address and  covering address &quot; Varod &quot;given in report of the 23rd August shall not be used.    Please address necessary letters with regard to the Irish matter to &quot; Casilla 866,&quot;and with regard to the other matter to &quot; Casilla 1201.&quot;    NOTE.

He is proceeding to  Chile inorder to obtain a fresh passport.    &quot; The Irish business (is going) well.&quot;    After the Russian Revolution in 1917  Sinn Fein began to turn attention to thepossibilities of intrigue with the Russian Socialists.  All the Allied Powers refused togive passports to their subjects to attend the International Socialist  Conference in stockholm.  Two intending delegates from Ireland were not permitted to leave.    The Sinn Fein leaders, however, in confederation with the Friends of Irish freedom in America, presented a statement to the International Socialist Conference at Stockholm.This statement was a lengthy document in the French language.   Extracts from it areprinted in Appendix B.   k typed copy of it was  found in De Valera&apos;s attache casewhen he was arrested on  17th May, 1918.  It is headed :                  &quot;THE  FRIENDS  OF IRISH  FREEDOM (NEW YORK).                                       &quot; Stockholm Bureau,                                                  &quot; Artillerigartan, 20, xii, 1917.                            &quot;LA QUESTION  IRLANDAISE.and was presented &quot; Pour le Bureau de Stockholm des Amis de la Liberte irlandaise.                            &quot; (Signe)       T.

    It is similar in outline and assertion to the  voluminous &quot; Case of Ireland for  thePeace Conference,&quot; extracts  from which  are printed in Appendix 0.  This appeal to russian and other social revolutionaries concludes thus :                             &quot;LA Voix DE l&apos;Irlande.    &quot;Pendant la guerre mondiale actuelle,  la voix  de l&apos;Irlande s&apos;est elevee solennelle-ment a trois reprises differentes :    &quot; D&apos;ahOrd a  New-York,  les 4  et  5  mars, a 1&apos;occasion du Congres national  desIrlandais dAmerique.  Ce Congres national, convoque en vue de trouver les  moyensd&apos;aider  l&apos;Irlande  a recouvrer son  independance apres la  guerre, s&apos;est  constitue  enorganisation nationale independante sous ce titre: &quot; Les Amis de la Liberte irlandaise.&quot;Le representant europeen cle cette organisation des Irlandais d&apos;Amerique est actuelle-ment M. T. St. John Gaffney, ci-devant consul  general dAmerique a Munich.   Dans laseance de cloture du Congres, a New-York, a laquelle assistaient  3,000 personnes, uneresolution a ete prise au milieu de demonstrations imposantes en enthousiasme.   Cetteresolution, qui prendra dans lTiistoire le nom de declaration a&quot;independance irlandaise,s&apos;adresse aux  Puissances  pour leur demander de  reconnoitre VIrlande  comme nationindependante.  On y lit, entre autres choses: &apos; Nous en appelons  aux Puissances pourreconnaitre  que   VIrlande  est une  ile europeenne,  et non une ile anglaise,  et pourapprecier le fait que I&apos;independance complete de VIrlande oVarec 1&apos;Empire britauniqueest la condition essentielle et  indispensable de la liberte des mers!    &quot; l&apos;Irlande  eleva une seconde ibis la voix lors du soulevement pendant la semainede Paques 1916 et par la proclamation  du Gouvernement  provisoire  de la Republiqueirlandaise.    &quot; Enfin, le 19 avril  1917, la voix  de l&apos;Irlande a retenti encore une fois dans1&apos;assemblee  des  delegues  du parti republicain irlandais,  convoquee  par le comteGeorge Plunkett    Cette  reunion,  tenue   a  1&apos;hotel de  ville  de  Dublin, adopta a1&apos;unanimite et  avec de frenetiques applaudissements une resolution d&apos;apres laquelle :l0 l&apos;Irlande constitue une  nation separee et reclame, en consequence, d&apos;etre representeea la Conference de la Paix, attendu que cette Conference aura le  devoir d&apos;assurer  auxpeuples la  liberte qu&apos;ils reclament, et de  garantir en general les  droits  des  petitesnations ; 20 la volonte du peuple irlandais souverain fait seul loi, et le peuple irlandaisest legitimement libre d&apos;executer ses decisions  sans obstacle et  sans aucune immixtionetrangere quelconque.    &quot; La voix de  l&apos;Irlande n&apos;aura pas retenti en vain.  Elle  trouvera son echo  aupresdes vrais amis de la liberte dans tous les pays.   Mais  c&apos;est  surtout a  la  vaillantedemocratic russe que iTrlande adresse sa legitime revendication de  pouvoir elle-memedecider de son sort  et  de ne pas  servir plus longtemps d&apos;instrument  aux vues  de1&apos;imperialisme britannique! &quot;    &quot; Nationality,&quot; an official organ  of  Sinn  Fein, edited  by Arthur Griffith, of  the23rd March, 1918, announced that:     &quot; The Stockholm Bureau of the &quot; Amis de la Liberte irlandaise &quot; handed to  theMinisters of the Powers there a statement  of the present  position in Ireland, and.  theclaim  of Ireland to equal freedom with Serbia and Belgium.   The document was signedfor the Bureau by Mr. St. John Gaffney, formerly Consul-General  of the  United States,and Dr. Chatterton Hill, Professor, Geneva  University.&quot;    Communications were taking place between Sinn Fein and  the Germans by meansof  U-boats off the West  Coast  of Ireland,  and   German propaganda leaflets  andpamphlets were thus disseminated in. Ireland.    A  Sinn  Fein  local leader   named   James  Ruane  was  arrested  on   the2nd December,  1917, at  Kiltimagh  in county Mayo,  and in  his  possession were found   two pamphlets  printed  in  Germany  and  bearing  the   official  impress,&quot;Kriegs-Ausschuss  der Deutschen Industrie, Berlin.&quot;   One  of  them  dealt withthe Proclamation  of the  Kingdom of Poland  on  the  5th  November  as  &quot;a newproof  for  the unswerving  confidence of  victory  of the  Central Powers&quot; &quot;aloud testimony  of  their internal  strength and capable  of  disproving  all the tales oftheir  internal relaxing spread lately  so assiduously by the press of the Entente&quot;  &quot;while all over the enemies are speaking  of  the  overthrow of Germany, this countryis strong enough to grant  freedom to a conquered country on its own responsibility.&quot;
                                      39    The &quot; liberation of small  nationalities  is one of the leading  watchwords of this war.  If we recall the English reign  of terror  in India and Ireland in  connection therewith we are thinking of the  last bloody insurrection in Ireland,  the  despairingappeal for help of the representatives of  mere Russian &apos; foreign  nationalities&apos; trans-mitted to  President Wilson some time ago-the falseness of this watchword will be atonce perceived &quot;    &quot; A New Baralong Case &quot; is the heading of another portion of  this pamphlet,which  alleged acts  of cruelty on the part of  the  English  in the destruction of  thesubmarine U-41 on the 24th September, 1915, off the Sciily Islands.    The second pamphlet was entitled  &quot; A French Project  against the EconomicalLife of Germany,&quot; and purported to reveal &quot; ciphered secret orders sent by  the FrenchGovernment to French prisoners  of war,  inviting  them  to   destroy  the  wholeagricultural  production and industry of Germany by introduction of poisonous germs.&quot;    Early in 1918 the authorities ascertained that arms and ammunition were beinglanded from Germany from time to time  on the  west  coast  of Ireland, and that  &quot; a message of Hope &quot; had been conveyed from Germany.  The Sinn  Feiners were led tobelieve  that another  revolution would bring the case  of Ireland before the PeaceConference,  and that Independence would be then secured.    Prominent leaders of  Sinn Fein were constant in  exhorting to  arm and drillsecretly; and  statements were widely spread  that, if  a  new Rebellion took  place, anumber of German officers  with machine guns and ammunition would be landed fromsubmarines.   It was stated that the German Emperor had made a  communication thathis personal support would be given to Ireland at the Peace Conference. information was also received by the Government that communication with Germany  was beingcarried  on  by a prominent  member of   the  Sinn  Fein Executive,  and that   this correspondence was conveyed by the master of a fishing boat on the west coast fIreland known to German submarine commanders.  Messages  in code were sent to german submarines by another prominent Sinn Feiner from the  coast of  Kerry,  andas the period for the great  German offensive of March 1918 drew  near,  and during its first months, frequent reference was made by  influential members of  the Sinn FeinAssociation  to approaching assistance from  Germany.  The following  are a  fewexcerpts from  some of these speeches, all  of which were made  by men who had been sentenced for participation in  the Rebellion of  Easter,  191(5, and released on amnesty.They were subsequently interned : February 10,  1918.     &quot; Germany has England by the  throat, who is  shouting for  mercy;  now is  thetime to work.&quot;March 3, 1918.     &quot; England is now beaten  to her knees  by the Central Powers.  She need not look to Ireland for help.   She  has been  our only enemy, and the only assistance we  willgive her is to draw the sword  and cut her  in twain.&quot;April U, 1918.     &quot;Fight not for  England but  against her.  England is the only  enemy of thiscountry.  Germany has her nearly beaten, and we want to be ready to give her thelast blow.&quot;April 14, 1918.     &quot;Their power was a well-aimed rifle,  the most effective to save them.  Whoknows but the Kaiser, always on the alert, would land an army of  deliverance onour shores VApril  17, 1918.     &apos;&apos; Be prepared to down tools and take a holiday,  and perhaps our action might reach  the workers  on  the Clyde  and in Wales, for  there is  a great  feeling ofindustrial unrest in England to-day, and the people over there are sick of conscrip-tion, and perhaps when England would be in  a state  of chaos, the Kaiser will landan army of deliverance on our shores.&quot;     Numerous other  specimens might be quoted of speeches hinting  at  the comingof German  assistance and. exhorting preparation for  a new rising.     On Saturday, the 12th April, 1918, a German emissary named J.  Dowling, alias442
0&apos;Brien, was landed in a small canvas boat on Crab Island,  off the County Clare,-from a  German submarine.  He had been  an  Irish soldier, taken prisoner by theGermans, and was one of the fifty-two men who were seduced into joining casement&apos;s&quot;Brigade&quot;  and  was one of  the  three  Lieutenants  of the  &quot;Brigade.&quot;   He  hadreceived  instructions from a German military  authority who directed  him to get in touch with the Sinn Fein leaders, ascertain the state of affairs,  and arrange withthem  (1) that they  should keep their people quiet  for two or three months, (2) fix the date, time and place for the landing of arms, machine guns, artillery and german troops in Ireland.   He was  to return to Germany either in a German submarinewhich he was to board  from a fishing boat, using a stated signal  to attract attention,or to get to Scandinavia in a neutral ship and thence to Germany.    Having regard to these German instructions, the following letter from a knownmember of the Irish Republican Army is  of  interest.  It was found on De Valera onthe occasion of his arrest on the 17th May, 1918 : My dear  De Valera,    Fm glad to have a  chance  of writing  to  you about  a matter  Fve been  ponderinglately.   You  may remember  my  putting forward  the opinion some time ago  thatenforcement of Conscription would  be based  on the principle of  raids from a centre ?Well, I think it might  be necessary to modify that  view.  It would seem, perhaps, amore  effective way  to  try sweeping drives.  For example take Clare an isolatedCounty.  They  might  deploy  a  strong  cordon  along  the  Shannon  from  Scariff toLimerick and sweep  seaward.   This method to he carried out everywhere simultaneouslywould require great numbers but  they  have those.   However,  it, would doubtlessencounter certain supply difficulties;  all the  same ammunition for instance, the  men could carry much of their needs on their backs.  In those districts where our men arefairly well trained, and fairly well armed I fancy these driving cordons could be  burstrepeatedly;  but in  other areas in  most  unhappily the only  policy would be to lieperdu until the cordon swept past.   This again would entail very  close searching whichmight be effective but some time  would be gained.  Indeed  time is  what we must play  for military   victory  is  less  likely.  Our  position is  much  like that  ofGen.  Cambronne after Waterloo!    &quot; Surrender,&quot; say  the Anglo-Prussian Cavalry ;&quot; Mort,&quot; replies Gen. Cambronne.    In the matter of communications I am glad to be able to say that Leitrim is beingworked up well.   And I understand an effort is being made to reach the hand to us from Cavan ; in  this way the  Shannon can be turned.   I would like to  be able to do more than I can ; but my health has not been as good as of old, and that with somepersonal  worries rather impairs my effectiveness.  Of course, Fm far from  down and out; Im just not all I might be.    I suppose Cavan will give us a lift, all right.   I  know the County slightly and am quite hopeful about it.  There and elsewhere  we must hope for the best.    As regards the  war, I fancy a renewal of the  heaviest fighting can be expected anytime now ;  the necessary re-constructions in rear otvthe.....probably completed bythis time.  Advances equal to former  ones would mean a German victory  on the  moststupendous scale; while it will not  be two months from the  beginning of the offensiveuntil the 21st instant.  Anyone who thinks the Allies have permanently stopped themmust be  forgetting the sequences in the manceuvie of Warsaw 1915.    An idea of the communications referred to in this letter may  be gathered from the document in Appendix  A (2) found in possession of De Valera when arrested.     On the 16th April, 1918, a German U-boat was  sighted in the vicinity of the  Kishlightship in  Dublin Bay and two men, named  Robert and  James Cotter,  who  wrereSinn Feiners-one of them a brother-in-law of  De Valera were intercepted at 4 A.M.next  morning in a  small  sailing  boat off Kingstown.   They were prosecuted andconvicted for violating Admiralty  regulations,   There  was  reason to believe  theywere communicating with the submarine.     On  the  17th March, 1918 St. Patricks Day the eve of the great final german offensive, a  remarkable gathering of the German-Irish Society was held  in the HotelAdlon, Berlin.   The meeting was under the auspices of  the German Government, andwas addressed at length by Frhr. von Stumm, as representative  of the Imperial ForeignOffice.   Representatives also of the German War Office, Admiralty and Foreign office were present, and  many other distinguished officials, Kuno Meyer and  his brother,Professor Eduard Meyer, and others of the German Professoriate were there  also.There were  present too Abdul Malitch Haniza Bey,  of  the Committee  of  Egyptian
Nationalists and  Young  Turks  Organisation  in Berne, editor  of &quot;L/Egypte&quot;  atGeneva;  Datta Bhupendranath, alias Dutt,  alias Dr. Haider, alias  Benganir  Bey,head  of  the  Berlin  Indians  during the war, and connected with  the  Berlin-IndianCommittee in issuing  among other the  seditious  publication  &quot;How  the Britishconquered India,&quot; and  representative for the Germans in Persia in 1915, and PillaiChempakaraman a  well-known  Indian  agitator Secretary  of  the  RevolutionaryAssociation in Berlin,  called the &quot;Vereinigung verfolgter Volker&quot; (the &quot;Society ofOppressed Peoples&quot;), and  other Indian and Egyptian promoters of  sedition.  GeorgeChatterton-Hill and  T. St. John Gaffney, who were  in intimate touch  with the sinn Fein leaders in  Ireland, were present, and Chatterton-Hill spoke at the  meeting.    The following messages  were sent by telegram from the German-Irish Society tothe Kaiser and Von Hindenburg :                                    &quot; MESSAGE.         &quot; On the occasion of their reception in celebration of St.  Patrick&apos;s Day, the    German-Irish Society craves  permission to offer to  your Majesty their  most    humble  devotion.    They express  the hope that  the mighty German  sword,    having completed the liberation of the oppressed nations in the East, will now in    the West also cleave asunder the chains which England has forged round Ireland.    For  the  Freedom  of  the  Seas will only  then be guaranteed when a free Ireland    steps forth the Watcher of the Atlantic.&quot;                                    &quot;REPLY.                                                &quot; General Headquarters,  19.3.18.         &quot; His Majesty the King  and Kaiser has received with much satisfaction the    gracious  address of the  German-Irish Society, and  heartily thanks them for it.    His  Majesty is  following  with keen  interest and lively sympathy the  fight that    brave Ireland is making  for freedom proudly conscious that the German sword    has already led a procession of nationalities to freedom.                              &quot;(Gez.)     GEHEIMER KABINETTSRAT  VON  BERG.&quot;                                  &quot; TELEGRAM.&quot;From the German-Irish Society, sitting at the Imperial Hotel, Berlin, 2Sth February,    1918,  to  His Excellency  Field-Marshal-in-Chief von  Hindenburg at  General    Headquarters.         &quot; The German-Irish  Society takes the opportunity afforded  by their extra-    ordinary general meeting to offer to your  Excellency their most profound and    respectful homage.  Confident that the forces handled in so masterly a manner    under your Excellences inspired leadership will finally overwhelm even our worst    enemy, we  look forward  in  the  fullest assurance  to a victorious issue of the    world war.  Penetrated by the conviction  that Ireland free  and independent of    England warrants  the freedom of the seas, and  consequently the freeing of the    world from England&apos;s. sea tyranny, we hope for a masterful German  peace, which    alone can afford  real guarantees for Germany  and for Ireland.&quot;                                    &quot; REPLY.                                               &quot; General Headquarters, 4.3.1918.         &quot; Hearty thanks for your kind remembrances.

GENERALFELDMARSOHALL  VON HINDENBURG.&quot;    The following message was also sent:        &quot; To his  Excellency the Imperial Chancellor,  Count Hertling, Berlin.         &quot; The German Irish  Society  in  their general meeting to-day thanks  your    Excellency for your repeated references to Ireland in your utterances dealing with    the restoration of independence to Nationalities upon  the conclusion of peace.         &quot; The Irish  nation, which more than a thousand  years  ago carried its high    civilisation with Christianity  far and wide  into Germany and  other parts of       [5056]                                               &quot;             G
    Europe, relying on the principle justitia fundamentum regnorum, claims emanci-    pation from English oppression.   The independence of Ireland is a real guarantee    for the freedom of the seas from the Anglo-Saxon yoke, a consummation which is the    universal aspiration  not only of the whole German people, but ot  all  nations of    the world.&quot;    As an official imprimatur of the proceedings of the meeting the following state-ments were published :          &quot;German  wireless (the  18th  March):          &quot; The reception  given by  the  Germano-Irish Society in Berlin,  on the    occasion of the Irish National Fete (Shamrock Day), gave rise to a demonstra-    tion of  a great  political  nature.  The  representative  of  the Foreign Office,    von Stumm, welcomed the Society, and expressed  the feeling of goodwill of the    German Government, which took a lively interest in the fate of Ireland.  The    speaker recalled the Easter Festival  in 1916, when, for the  first time for a long    period, a Republic had been proclaimed in Ireland and when the harp  colours    of the Emerald Isle had once again waved on the public buildings of its capital.    By means of ship&apos;s guns and machine guns the British Government had finally    succeeded in suppressing the movement, after stubborn fighting.   Since then    the English Government  has  drawn  a thick veil  between Ireland and the    remainder of the world, by means of issuing false reports describing the serious    unrest as a &apos; little dissatisfaction,5  whereas  the  real position was kept secret    and military measures had been taken for suppressing the Irish people, and for     the destruction  of its  independence, which England represents  as  for the     re-establishment  of order in the interests of the  people.  What English peace     means the inhabitants of  Ceylon and the Boers  in  the  Transvaal are  able to     relate.   In  Germany, which a  hundred years ago engaged  in a  great fight for     its liberty against  the French Emperor, the fight of brave  Ireland has aroused     deep sympathy.  We shall not allow ourselves to  be blinded by English  reports     as to Irish unrest and disregard of laws.  So far  England has not  given liberty     to any small nation, neither has she prepared the way for such liberty.  So far     she has only muzzled and  suppressed them. History daily gives proof of this.  The     procedure of England stands in striking contrast to that of the abused enemy     Germany, whose successes of  arms have already led a number of nations to     liberty.  England  always  has  the liberty of small nations as a phrase in her     mouth, not because&apos;she has any intention of really bringing  it about, but  because     she believes thereby  to  weaken her enemies.  Asquith  recently declared  that     territorial conquests made by  England in  this war should come  before the     peace conference.  If he is really in earnest about this, it is his duty to  see that     the peace conference treats of the fate of  Ireland.  In the  fight for  self-     determination she  can at all times count upon the sympathy of the whole of the     German nation.  At the same meeting, Chatterton-Hill reviewed the (?situation)     and closing his  speech said: &apos; When the day of liberty breaks (message     defective).   The assembly sent a telegram of respect  to  the  German  Kaiser,     expressing the hope that now, when in the East the (?enemy) had been defeated,     the German sword would also  cut the chains of Ireland.   The freedom of the     seas would only be assured when a free Ireland is made the  watcher of the     Atlantic Ocean.&apos;&quot;    EXTRACT FROM ARTICLE IN  &quot;BERLINER TAGEBLATT,&quot;  DATED MARCH 18,  1918.                     ST. PATRICK^ DAY CELEBRATION IN BERLIN.     &quot; The celebration of the Irish National Festival  instituted by the German Irish Society on the occasion  of  St. Patricks  Day was held last evening in the Hotel Adlon, Berlin, and  was attended by a numerous company.   Graf Westarp,  Con- servative Deputy of  the  Reichstag,  welcomed  the guests in the  name  of the Committee, and stated that a people which was  incapable of a righteous hatred towards their mortal  enemies was also incapable of any profound devotion to its own  cause.   England, Ireland&apos;s mortal enemy,  had now become the  mortal enemy of Germany.  Before  the war, the German people had never thought that  it would be their mission to  destroy England&apos;s maritime tyranny, but Germany had been compelled to undertake this task,  and was in a position to accomplish it, thanks to numerical superiority which she had now achieved,  and to the U-boats.
     &quot;A lengthy speech was delivered  by Councillor of Legation  von Stumm, asrepresentative of the Foreign Office. .  . .     &quot;Dr.  George Chatterton Hill thanked  the  company  for  their warm-heartedinterest in the Irish question.   He welcomed those  present who shared his views,particularly those from Egypt, India,  and Persia.   He stated that Ireland was onthe eve of great events, as the journey of Lord French to Ireland showed a journeywhich, in view of the state of communications in the Irish Sea was certainly nopleasure trip.  The reason of all this was  summarised in  the two words  &apos;SinnFein,&apos;  that great political,  economic,  and  cultured movement which  recognisedEngland as the evil genius of Ireland, and which thwarted and combated her in every direction.  The movement therefore raised  the  cry &apos; Separation from  England !*and demanded Ireland for the Irish. From the moral point of view Ireland was thebest contradiction of England&apos;s hypocritical boast  that she was fighting for thefreedom of the smaller nations.     &quot;An address upon Germany and the Irish question by Kommerzienrat Dr. KarlGoldschmidt concluded the proceedings.&quot;       Extract from the &quot; Irishman&quot; (one of the official organs of Sinn Fein),                              dated April 6, 1918.     &quot; Speaking at a largely attended meeting in  Foxford (Co. Mayo) on Sunday, the31st March, 1918, Citizen Arthur Griffith, referring to the meeting of the German-IrishSociety at Berlin on St. Patricks Day, said that followed the presentation of a claim  at stockholm to the same treatment for Ireland as would  be accorded to Poland.  Copiesof the claim were accepted by all the neutral  and  Central  Powers.  The gathering at berlin was officially visited by the German Government, and the representatives of theGerman Government declared that they would support Ireland&apos;s claims at the PeaceConference. It was because she feared that they  were going  to  that court  Englandwanted to set up a bogus Home Rule.&quot;     The evidence  in possession  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government made it clear that adesign existed  on the part of Germany, in combination with the Sinn Fein Extremistsand Irish revolutionaries in America, to land arms in Ireland and  bring about anotherIrish Insurrection, and thus divert British troops from  the front in FYance.     In April  1918 it was definitely ascertained  that the plan  for  landing arms inIreland was ripe for execution,  and that the Germans only awaited definite information from Ireland arranging the time,  place and date.  The British authorities were able to warn the Irish Command regarding the probable  landing from  a submarine  of theGerman agent  Dowling, who was  arrested on the 12th  April as above stated.     The plans for the new rising  depended largely  on the disembarkation of munitionsfrom submarines,  and  it was  designed  to  follow  on the anticipated success  of thegreat German offensive in France.  On the 4th May,  19LS, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentreceived  information  that  on the  evening  of the  26th April, 1918,  seven  closedrailway  cars had arrived at Cuxhaven and were run alongside two large submarines ;the contents of the trucks rifles and machine guns- were transferred to the submarines.These consignments did  not arrive in Ireland.     On the 17th  and  18th May, 1.918, De  Valera and a  large  number of the otherprominent leaders of the sedition in Ireland were arrested and held interned until  afterthe victory of the Allies had been secured.   De Valera and some others escapedfrom custody in the spring of 1919 ; the rest were  all released from internment inMarch 1919.     After the arrest of the leaders above mentioned  the German intrigues with thedisaffected Irish were still carried on.  The following communications are disclosed.From General Staff, Political, Berlin, to German Military Attache, Madrid.     &quot; No. 25122 of 16th April, 1918.     &quot; With reference to telegram 1172 of 1st April.     &quot; Arnold&quot; s return to Germany is not advisable because of the risk of his seizure.

No. 4013 of 22nd November.  &apos;        &quot; Arnold has had 15,000 marks per month at his disposal for the S. service    and communications with Ireland.&quot;    The following is an excerpt from the German Government organ the &quot; KolnischeZeitung,&quot; the 8th July, 1918:-        &quot; Since  casement&apos;s death, and to a  greater extent since the heroic but    unfortunate Easter Rebellion  (1916) in Dublin, Ireland and her fate have roused    lively interest throughout wide  circles of our people.  This  sympathy is in a    double sense not only justified but even politically necessary.   The little Celtic    country has to no other country in Europe such close and valuable historical rela-    tions as to Germany, and no other country can, like Ireland, continually raise up    difficulties for England.  The historical relations of the Emerald Isle and its    representatives of culture in the Middle Ages (the famous monks)  to central    Europe of the present day, including Switzerland  (St.  Gall), have only  lately    come to be properly appreciated by the historians of culture.&quot;         &quot; This debt of gratitude  to Irish  culture can  now be repaid by the German    people.&quot;         &quot; Germany and England will  one day when the war is over again have to    live together in peace.  But this peace, as the experiences of France and Holland    in the past teach  us, will have no real meaning for the English people, but will
only constitute the formulation of a legal situation temporarily conceived, and recognised as the result of a  relationship of power that has occurred.  Dailyand hourly we shall have to remind the Britons  after the conclusion of peacethat this peace with us has to mean more than an armistice.  For this purposewe must not only provide ourselves with securities against possible Continentalallies of England, but we must remind her by relations openly maintained withparts of her empire that have been despoiled of their rights, that it depends onlyon us when we are disposed to come forward as the champions of her numerousoppressed peoples.  Whoever like England has  constructed his world-empire oncompulsion, force, and spiritual oppression  of  the constituent parts, is subject in the fear of its falling to pieces to an impulse of psychological weakness thatcripples his power of decision.  The most sensitive impulse to excite this feeling of  weakness   was  always the resurgence  of   the  Irish  question  involved inIreland&apos;s striving for national independence.&quot;    &quot; Love for the  home country  and hatred  against England in all Englishcolonies, in the United States, and in the South American republics, notably inChile, united  all citizens of Irish  origin in  a desire to  direct against england the forces of  the new home, and the policy of the new country.&quot;    &quot;The Irish in England  and  Ireland will never allow peace to reign in english  politics.   The  Irish in  the  great  English  colonies,  especially  inAustralia, will be the lever that will effect the  downfall of the English Empire.If  the individual portions of the English  world-empire withdraw  from thepolitical influence of the mother country in order  to pursue their own policyeither without or against England, one can see who will  be the leaders in this movement.  The Irish  will certainly be among them.   Should  the politicalrelation of the United States to England change again later on, Irish influencewill be decisive in that connection.  If difficulties crop up for England anywherethroughout the world, which are not to be explained  by natural opposition, letone seek for the Irish spirit as the driving force.  Thus the struggle between a world-empire  and its small insignificant dependency  is implacably carried on.The weapons  are unequal, but the effect of the Irish  movement is expressed bythe proverb:   &apos; Constant dropping wears the stone.&apos;  If we wish this effect to operate in England, it is not our task to interfere in Irish conditions possibly inthe sense that we should at the conclusion of peace demand from England a fewapparent concessions to Ireland that could not be supervised by us, but we mustas  individuals,  as traders,  and as  representatives of  Government resolutelythroughout the world in all  countries offer our hand as allies to England&apos;sparticular natural enemy, the Irishman.  We must further help every Irishman,because he will help us to enjoy in quiet the fruits of  our  victory over England.The continued efficacy of the Irish movement is for  us a guarantee of peace.&quot;
APPENDIX A (1).Copy of Notes found in possession  of  De Valera  token arrested.  Manuscript  in                             his own handwriting.MEMORANDUM ON  IRISH ARMY ORGANISATION.I. INTRODUCTO II Y.                      (A.) General Problem of Irish Defence.     The Military Defence of Ireland should provide for three distinct contingencies :          (a.) Raids.      1         (b.) Purely Naval Attack.         (c.) Combined Naval and Military Attack, i.e., Regular Invasion.     These would all be primarily problems of Military, not of Naval, Defence.   ireland would not be able to maintain such a fleet as  would be  the sole or even the principalsafeguard of her territory.   She  could  only  maintain the smaller  craft suitable  forpatrolling, commerce-raiding, and harrying an invader&apos;s  lines  of communication thusacting as auxiliaries to the military defence of the  country.     Considering in order the several kinds of attack it is evident that      (a.) Raids would be made with a  definite local objective which to some extent           could be foreseen.  These are not naval raids,,but  landings of small forces.          , Such could be provided against by : -                1.  An efficient coast patrol-naval and military ;               2.  A mobile striking force maintained  within reach of the  centres                      likely to be attacked.     (b.) Purely Naval Attack can  always be met  and defeated by adequate Coast           Batteries.     (c.) Regular Invasion-Thls contingency is quite different from (a) or (b): they           are  sudden  and partial, this  is prolonged and systematic.  They must be           met  at  once and  could be  met successfully by suitable small  forces, this           requires large forces but admits of time to develop them.  It calls  for the           mobilisation of an army.     An Irish Army, therefore, must be in a position to cope with two distinct types of attack      (a.) Sudden, local  and partial requiring a certain type  of Standing Force to           meet it.     (o.) An attempt to overthrow the naidon-^-to be resisted  by the military effort of           the nation as a whole, organised as a thoroughly efficient  militia.     Any  tendency to  subordinate the  Militia  to the  Standing  Forces  would beinadmissible as the problem of the Militia is in last analysis the most serious of all.   Asfar as possible continuity of the services would obtain.                         (B.)-Special Tactical Conditions.     As regards the various arms of the service the following remarks may be made:    :  (a.) There  need be no Cavalry: in Ireland this arm has little scope ;it is expensive           and  troublesome to  train effectively;  the question of horse-supply  and           training would present needless difficulties.(
     (6.) Cyclists would  replace Cavalry, and could be used in considerable  numbers.            Cycling is very common in Ireland, the road mileage is big, and the mobility            of such troops would be of great use in cases of raids or even invasion.     (c) Flying Artillery with a light handy gun mounted on an armoured motor would &apos;            be advisable.   Half-batteries of two guns and  forward action of single  guns            might  be  often  employed.  In  hedge-country  pack-artillery  might  be            employed.     (d.) The number and importance of the Irish harbours call  for a far larger force of            Coast Artillery  relatively than in  any  other  country of similar size and            defence conditions.                  II. GENERAL CHARACTER OF  PROPOSED SCHEME.     In view of the different kinds of attack to which an independent Ireland would be exposed, it is necessary to maintain Standing  Forces of a special kind  and a national Militia Army linked with the Standing Forces.   It is necessary to consider each  of these forces separately ;  and first as to the                                  STANDING FORCES.     First  of all there is required a Coast Artillery Corps  to provide  for the defence of the principal seaport towns  against naval attack.   To  meet the case of raids alluded to above other forces are  necessary: these,would  be a  Coastal Patrol force,  for which purpose in Ireland Cyclists are the  most  suitable  arm.  To act in conjunction with the Coastal Patrol, and also  with the Coast Batteries there would be needed a Signal Corps.y In addition to these a mobile Striking Force would be required, consisting  of Flying Artillery and some other units with attendant services,     (NOTE. The number, kind and training of Aviation Troops is too special a question to be treated casually, and the experience of the present war should be fully assimilated. Possibly the  anti-aircraft batteries would be  part of the Coast  Artillery; scouting aircraft  attached to the Coastal Patrol  and  Signal  Corps, and battle-planes  to the Striking Force.)     In addition to the above permanent troops there would also  be maintained on a permanent footing certain Training and Administrative Personnel of  the                                 NATIONAL MILITIA.     This force would be modelled on the Militia Armies of Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and  Switzerland.   In those countries the soldiers undergo  a lengthy Recruit Training during the first year of liability, supplemented  by a series  of shorter periods in subsequent  years.  The National Militia is  the real  defence of the country, and should be  able to furnish :      1. A  sufficiently numerous and efficient army to take the field  before danger  could           &apos; seriously threaten the country.     2. Trained Reserves sufficient to maintain  this army at proper strength.     3. In case of necessity the service of every able-bodied man.                              PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTION.     As the Militia Service would be comparatively short, it would be necessary to  get the fullest value from it by having the Recruits already partially  trained.   For this purpose the older hoys in the schools would receive a Cadet Training  on  the lines of the Fianna na Eirrann.     Under the Irish Educational System the School Training of Cadets would cease at the age of 17.  This would  leave a gap of some years before  the man was called up for Militia Training.  During these years a certain  peace training would  be  required of these youths.     Thus  from boyhood a  continuous military training of varying effectiveness would be imparted to each man until joining the Militia.   The sequence would  be  carried  out by further recruiting the Standing Forces from the Militia by Voluntary Enlistment.     To ensure the smoothest and  most efficient  working of the  scheme in  peace and war the recruiting and training of all forces would be,  as far,as possible, on a  territorial basis; the military  service of men, especially  specialists, would correspond  as  far as
possible  to their  peace  avocations, and the  material and personnel  of railways, &amp;c,would be taken over as going concerns by the Military Authorities upon the declarationof war.                           III. THE SCHEME IN DETAIL.                                 (A.) Recruiting.     Liability for service in defence of the country begins with registration for the                           CADETS AND NATIONAL GUARD.     Every boy  must register  on reaching  the age of  13.  The Registers would becompiled by Voluntary Enrolment, from School Rolls and from  Census Returns.   Theywould be kept properly checked  and fully  up-to-date.   Registration  would be on a county basis, each County having a Recruiting Staff Officer with a small  clerical staff for this work.     The duty of the Recruiting Staff Officer would be to      1. Register boys and youths liable for training.     2. Enter for  training  as they became liable.     3. Organise  Cadet units.     4.&apos; Organise  National  Guard units, i.e.,  youths  in the transition period between           Cadets and Militia.     5. Organise and train Second Line Reservists with National Guard.                                     MILITIA.     The  Recruiting  Staff  Officer  would  annually  forward to his Militia DivisionalHeadquarters a full return of youths in his County who  were finishing their period ofservice in the National Guard.   This  would  take place in the  year in  which the manreached 20 years.  Before that  age most men  would not be physically best suited formilitary  training  of the most vigorous kind which would be required.     Exemptions  might be  granted in  special cases, but  all  men so exempt would haveto undergo their Recruit Training in a subsequent year.     Youths who  had reached the age of 18  might be accepted before liable  if of a highphysical  standard.  From this class many valuable N.C.Os. and Officers would doubtless be forthcoming.                                ,                                 STANDING FORCES.     These would be recruited by  Voluntary Enlistment of men who  had completed their Recruit Training in  the Militia.  The necessary numbers would  be  readilyforthcoming; indeed the probability  is  that  sufficient  men would  offer themselves to admit of a strict selective process and  the securing of men of a very good stamp.                              (B.) Nature of Service.                                     CADETS.    Details of Cadet  Training would have to be  arranged  with the  EducationalAuthorities.  The Training would in the  first instance aim at developing the physiqueof the boys.   The military instruction would include Drill, Musketry, &amp;c.  The boyswould be trained  as Infantry only.  The Instructors could be furnished by the NationalGuard.   The period of service  would extend from the  13th to the 17th year.                                NATIONAL  GUARD.    The period of service would extend from the 13th to the 20th year.   The Trainingwould be strictly territorial,  i.e., carried out within  reach  of the man&apos;s home  and atconvenient times.  The  National Guard  would  be  trained as Infantry only.  TheInstructors could be furnished from the  Militia.  For purposes of Organisation andTraining the  unit of  the  National  Guard would be  the  Company and  as  a  rulecompanies  would have a low effective.   In  the event  of  war, youths serving in the
 National Guard would belong to the  Second Line  &quot;Reserve.   The  Training of the National Guard would consist annually as follows :           1.  40 drills of 1^ hours each.          2.  Certain Parades.          3.  Week-end in Camp in Summer.          4.  Course of Musketry.     N.B. A careful  grounding in Musketry would be imparted to the National Guard. Every facility for  Miniature Rifle Practice would  be  afforded,  and in addition each youth would  annually fire  25  rounds of service ammunition on an out-door  range. Further facilities would be given to those likely to prove exceptional marksmen.                                      MILITIA.     The period of service is  12 years in First Line, 8 years in Second Line, and 10 years in Third Line or from the 20th to the 50th year.   Recruit Training would take place in the 20th year, and  would  be continuous for 3 months in the Infantry, and 4 months in the other arms or longer if  necessary.  During the  remainder  of his  First Line service the man would be  called out for further training in the  2nd,  3rd,  4th and 7th years of liability.  During his Second  Line service he would be called out for further training at stated times of  which training  Musketry and Guard  Duty would form an  important part.  Adequate and convenient ranges  must be provided for the shooting of reservists all the  year round.  Shooting  competitions  under the  guidance of the Instructors would  be encouraged.     Training of reservists would not take place at the same time as Recruit training. Thus the work  of officers and N.C.Os. would be more evenly distributed through the year;  and units  of  well-trained troops  would be  available for working out Staff Problems, &amp;c.  N.B. A large proportion of the annual contingent of Recruits would be trained as Cyclists;  mainly  by volunteering for that arm.    (Bicycle parts  would require to be gradually standardised as each man would have the  machine at his house.) For physical reasons Cyclists would be mobilised as Infantry once they had  passed into Second Line Reserve.  An exception would be made  in the case of qualified mechanics.                                 STANDING FORCES.     Service  would correspond  to that in the Militia, and  the Second Line Reserve and Third Line Reserve would be identical.   That is to  say, after the age of 32 the soldier of the  Standing Forces would belong to the same force, undergo the  same training, and be called out along with the Militia soldier of the same age.     First  Line Service in the  Standing  Forces  would consist  of  3 years with  the Colours and the remainder  in First  Line Reserve, up to  the age of 32, when the man would automatically pass into Second Line.     Re-enlistment from year  to  year would be  permitted if the soldier preferred it. Such re-enlistment might continue up to the  age of 40, when the soldier would in  any case pass into Third Line Reserve.     In addition to the First Line Reservists  described above, there would  be another type of Reservist to be mobilised with the Standing Forces in the event of war.   These would  consist of certain technical and semi-combatant personnel, Le., supernumerary electricians  for  the Coast Defences, extra mechanics for Cyclists or Flying Artillery, &amp;c. These would be added from a special reserve of a technical kind.   This special reserve would evidently consist of men  inferior  in discipline to the men with the colours.   It would, therefore, be necessary to  keep their  numbers within such limits as the peace- time effectives could absorb without loss of efficiency.                   IV. TRANSITION FROM EXISTING CONDITIONS.    To cover the years necessary to admit of the Scheme getting into working order,the Government would be empowered to make the best possible use  of the whole malepopulation up to the age of 40 years, for the purpose of gradually fitting  the system on to it.    The following  conditions would require to be met:     1.  The  Organisation should fit  in  with the existing Volunteer System.   This is           largely met by the National  Guard.      [5056]   -                                                         H
     2. It should  be  capable  of assimilating Irish troops  at present in the British           Service.   This could  be secured by adopting the  British Training Manuals.     3. It should not strain the  country economically.  This  could be secured  by the           utilisation of all existing barracks,  ranges, camps, &amp;c, most  of which are           quite suitable.     4. It should leave no scope for political friction.  This might be attained by drafting           East Ulster recruits elsewhere  for  training, and  vice versa.   The North-           East Coast  Defences  and  Coast  Patrol  could  be maintained by men           recruited in  the South of Ireland.   For  probably the latter region  would           always supply the bulk of the  Standing Forces.  In course of time political           animus would doubtless die out  altogether, as has been the  case in Italy           since the Unification.     In general, the first aim should  be to secure an adequate defence force with theminimum of  friction.   The most readily  available men  would  be enlisted  in thrmost convenient centres, and details would right themselves gradually.   Incompetentswould be eliminated in course of time, and the scope of the system would be graduallyextended.     N.B. Police Barracks might be  used  everywhere to          (a.)  Serve as Registration Depots ;         (6.)  Store Army Property;         (c.)  House Permanent Details ;         (d.)  Serve as local Mobilisation Centres.                          Y. A DEFECT OF THE  SYSTEM.     The weak point of all Militia Army systems is  the variation of the number of men with the colours according to the time of year.   Tn the  present scheme the existence  ofa  highly-efficient  Standing Force  would  offset  this  defect in  part.   Rapidity  ofmobilisation would still further diminish the risk.  All the same, the  following extraprecautionary measures seem desirable :      (a.)  Training of Recruits from  the large  towns  could largely be carried  out  in           barracks in winter.     (b.)  Extension Militia training of such specialists as machine gunners, snipers, &amp;c,           could also be carried  out in winter.     (c.)  Training of  Militia Reservists could be adapted to the same end.     (d.)  Special training of Coast  Artillery, Signal Corps, &amp;c, could  also take place           during the slack period.     (e.)  Of course, all Units of the Standing Forces would in peace time be so stationed           as to be available for  protection of the vital spots.     In  this  context  it is  advisable  to draw  closer attention to the nature  of the,Standing Forces which are  specially designed to provide against such  a surprise attackas that suggested.   Taking the constituent forces in order :                                 COASTAL  ARTILLERY.     This arm is originally recruited from the Artillery Units of the Militia, and is thusoriginally trained with  light pieces  at land targets.  A high gunnery  level is thusobtained, and it would be  possible in case of need  to  utilise  some of the gunners  asfield artillery men.   In  addition, following  the  U.S.A.  model, the  Coast  Artillerymenare trained as Infantry, which would help  to meet the case of small local raids.                                  COASTAL  PATROL.     This force would be kept  at a high  effective  and be  largely used to maintaincommunication  in conjunction with  the Signal  Corps.   The  force would be recruited from the Cyclist Units of the Militia.                                   SIGNAL CORPS.  .  The Signal Companies would be stationed permanently  along the  coast, and wouldbe changed  with the Service  of Inter-Communication.   In  addition  to Signallers
 proper it would include despatch riders, wireless operators, balloonists, &amp;c.  Connection between the Coast Artillery and the Coastal  Patrol would, in particular, be  the duty of the Signal Corps.                                  STRIKING  FORCE.     This force would consist  of Flying  Artillery,  Cyclists,  Machine  Gunners  and Snipers.  The aim would be to have handy  bodies of very superior troops ready to meet any emergency.   The Striking  Force  would be maintained  in  suitable centres to reinforce threatened points.     It would be essential to have  the most thorough  co-operation between the several branches of the Standing Forces.  Among other methods  this could be largely obtained by  the practice of exchanging officers of the several arms for periods of training with arms other than their own.     N.B. The Service of Aviation would be  suitably provided for as  indicated above         in Section II.                    VI. PROVISION OF  OFFICERS AND N.C.0.&apos;S.     The  scheme  would call  for  several hundred  permanent  officers,  a  still  larger number of  Militia officers, a  couple of  thousand permanent N.C.O.&apos;s, and still more Militia N.C.O.&apos;s.   Moreover, in order to get the fullest efficiency from the armed forces as a whole a high  standard efficiency would  have to be maintained.                                     OFFICERS, when  desiring  to  become  Officers, would state  their  intention of such on  entering the Militia.   Of course, youths  enlisting voluntarily  before called  up  would have an advantage of a couple of years in this respect.   Every aspirant must      1. Undergo the full Recruit Training in his arm.     2. Satisfy his superiors that he will  be a suitable Officer.     3. Undergo six  months&apos; Officers&apos; Training in  the Military College.     4. Pass the Officer&apos;s Examination in his arm.     Aspirants fulfilling these conditions  would  then be appointed  Militia Officers in order of seniority.   Some would prefer to remain Militia Officers, and these would be retained  in that  capacity.   Others would wish  to  become  Officers in the Standing Forces, and these would further      1. Serve as Militia Officers for one year and give satisfaction in that capacity.     2. Undergo a further course of one year in the Military College.     3. Pass a further and very searching examination.     It will be seen that no man would become a Militia Officer  before reaching the age of 20, nor an Officer  of the Standing Forces  before 22.  Staff  Officers would have to undergo a further  course of Higher Military Study.     The efficiency of the Militia Officers would be kept up by Refresher  Courses, StaffRides,  &amp;c.   In many respects the R.I.C. Depot in Phoenix Park is very suitable, for aMilitary College.                                     N.CO.&apos;S.     In the Militia the sources for obtaining  KC.O.&apos;s would be :     1.  Aspirants  for the  Officers  grade  who   failed  to  fulfil   all  the  necessary           conditions.     2.  Promotion  of other suitable men from  the ranks.     In the case of the Standing Forces :     1.  Men who had qualified as  Militia  Officers might prefer to enter the Permanent           Forces as N.C.O.&apos;s.     2.  Men could  be directly promoted from the ranks.     3.  Militia N.C.O.&apos;s could  enter the  Standing Forces in the same capacity after a           probationary period of  attachment to a unit of the Standing Forces.       [5056]        &quot;                                                 H 2
    Inducements to keep the ranks of N.C.O.&apos;s well filled would be offered by prospects of good civil employment for such men  on retirement.   In addition to the ordinarymethod of appointing Officers, provision would be  made  for  direct appointment ofN.C.O.&apos;s to  the  Officers grade.  Thus  good men who on entering the  army had  not intended to become Officers would be able to do so later if they wished.    The pay of all ranks, in conjunction with  their found furnishings, would suffice tomaintain a suitable status.   Extravagance  on  the  part of wealthy Officers would  notbe allowed,  but  such Officers would  be encouraged to  present trophies calculated toencourage skill in shooting, bayonet fighting, &amp;c.                           VII.- HIGHER ORGANISATION.                  &apos;  (A.)-Organisation of Higher Units in Peace     As regards facilities for housing and training troops, the existing English arrange-ments and buildings could be adopted with only slight modifications.   But as regardsthe  employment  of  the  Defence Forces, the principle would be  altogether  different.At the present time  the underlying idea is to provide defence against a landing  on theWest  Coast backed by  a  possible insurrection  of the  people.   A  self-contained,independent, country would, on the contrary, expect any attack to  be made against theimportant centres of population on the East Coast.   So, too, the existing English coast defences  in  Ireland are placed so as to protect Naval anchorages in remote districts,and not to protect the important Coast towns.     The total  Coast line&apos; of Ireland is very long, and in some cases  the importantcentres  are  quite  far apart.  Unavoidably,  then,  the  peace-time disposition  of theStanding Forces would be more or less cordon-fashion round the country.   For example,the  main defended  sectors  of the Coast might  easily be Dublin, the  South Coast,Belfast, Derry, Sligo,  Galway Bay,  the Shannon Estuary,  Cork, Waterford andWexford though of course the importance of these  would be very different.  the weakness of the cordon system would be diminished by the actual existence of          1.  A Sea Frontier.         2.  Good Internal Communications.     All the same it would  be necessary to maintain  a high standard of efficiency,co-operation and. vigilance among all units of the Defence Forces.     A suitable Higher Army Organisation  for  a country of the size and general conditions would be 6 Divisions in peace time apportioned to 6                                 DIVISIONAL AREAS.     The various political, administrative, strategic  and geographical conditions  might best be met by the following distribution, as shown  on map :      1st Division. The counties of Donegal, Derry, Tyrone, Sligo, Leitrim, Fermanagh.                      (Headquarters : Derry.)     2nd Division. The  counties  of Antrim, Down,  Armagh, Monaghan, Cavan.                      (Headquarters:  Belfast.)     3rd Division. The counties of Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Longford, Westmeath,                      King&apos;s.   (Headquarters: Athlone.)     4th Division. The counties of Louth, Meath, Kildare, Dublin, Wicklow.  (Head-                      quarters :  Dublin.)     5th Division. The counties of Clare, Limerick, Kerry,  Cork.   (Headquarters:                      Cork.) ^     6th Division. The counties of  Queen&apos;s, Tipperary,  Kilkenny, Carlow, Wexford,                      Waterford.   (Headquarters: Waterford.)     Extra Brigade Headquarters for the Divisions might be:  Sligo or  Inniskillen,Clones, Galway, Dundalk, Limerick or Fermoy, Kilkenny.
     The  following  general  conditions  might  suitably  govern  the   composition,organisation, &amp;c, of each Division :      The G.O.C. the Division and the Divisional Staff.     The several recruiting Staff Officers of  the counties in the Divisional  Area.     The Artillery Divisional Staff.     Personnel of Auxiliary Service.*     Permanent Personnel of Militia Units.t     Standing Forces of the Divisional Area.     Militia Forces of the Divisional Area.                           (B.)-Expansion on Mobilisation.     The strength  of. the  Division  might suitably be  of Infantry  3 regiments = 9 battalions. =  9,000 men.     For six Divisions this would give a full strength  of  54,000 men.    But  probably the annual contingent of Recruits which it would be found  possible to train would not number  more than  half that figure,  and of these not all would be available for the infantry.  Companies would thus not number more than  100 men as  an average; so that special provisions would require  to be made for exercising Officers and  N.C.O.&apos;s with full-strength companies.     Once  the scheme was in operation it is  clear that the  number of First  Line Reservists of the  Militia would far more than  suffice to  fill the six Divisions.    Con- sequently the six  Divisions could each have another  Division linked to it practically at once.  For this purpose manifestly it is necessary to  have plenty of well-trained militia officers and N.C.O.&apos;s.     Partly from the residue of First Line Reservists and partly from  the  pick of the Second Line Reservists further divisions could be added without much  further delay  and  these  too  would be of a quality not  noticeaoly inferior  to  any  of  the former Divisions.     All  the fighting divisions would then be fed from Second Line.     Three contingencies would be  possible as regards the  time at which mobilisation for war took place.     1. During  no Training Period:  proper measures  elaborated in  Peace-time would            obviate friction in this  case.     2. During  Reservist Training:  this would be  the  most  favourable case.    War            strength could be reached by re-embodying the just-trained recruits of the            former period.     3. During Recruit Training :  this would be the least favourable case, as  it would            be dangerous to bring Reservists into the Recruit  units.    The  Training            Periods  would have to be arranged with special reference to this difficulty.                             VIII. NUMBERS  AND COST.                                   (A.) Numbers.    It is necessary to have an approximate  idea of  the number of troops  available under the proposed scheme.   In these estimates Cadets will not be included,  only thefirst three lines being taken into account.   And in making  the  calculations it is mostsuitable to begin with the.                                       MILITIA.    In any given  year the number of men  reaching  military age can  be calculated at 1 per  cent,  of  the population, or 43,000.  Various considerations,  largely  financial,   * Engineers, Transport, Medical, &amp;c., services would be so organised as to fit in with peace  conditions.Only such permanent personnel would be maintained as to ensure  smooth working of mobilisation.

would reduce the number available for actual training  to  say 25,000.   Accordingly wemay estimate as follows :          1st L.

COST.     The only  cost  here calculated  is Annual Expenditure.   The aim is  to keep  it within the present R.LC. figure 1,800,0002.   Tn addition, there would be a considerablecapital expenditure  on Coast Defence Works, for which the services of the best existing authorities should be secured :                                                                               The Recruit Training of 25,000 at 201. would annually  -  500,000         Standing Forces of 8,000-9,000 of all ranks annually ...  =  500,000         Extra officers and N.C.O.&apos;s  for  various  purposes             annually  ...       ...       ...       ...       ...  =  250,000Total  ...       ...        ..   -1,250,000    After some years add Training of  50,000 Reservists at 5/.       ...       ...      250,000                                 Total  ...       ...       ...    1,500,000     This  would leave an annual  margin of 300,0001. below the annual R.I.C. figure.Moreover, the above rough estimate is based on English  pre-war estimates, which wereby no means the most economical,  and but little reduction has been made from them.

THE  FRIENDS  OF IRISH  FREEDOM (NEW YORK).                                           STOCKHOLM BUREAU,                                                 Artillerigatan 28 B, Stockholm.                                                           20 : XII:  1917.                                 LA QUESTION IRLANDAISE.Monsieur le Ministre,     &quot; Les Amis de la Liberte irlandaise &apos;&apos;  constituent une organisation dont le nomindique  le  but.    Cette  organisation  fut  creee  a  New-York en mars  1916, enconsequence d&apos;une decision prise par la  Convention de la Race irlandaise aux Etats-Unis.  Elle compte des branches dans chaque ville importante de 1&apos;Union et elle mene,au nom des Irlandais d&apos;Amerique, la lutte en faveur des revendications de la mere-patrie.
    Les soussignes, qui out fonde  a Stockholm  le  bureau europeen  de la society&quot;Les Amis de la Liberte irlandaise,&quot;  ont  1&apos;honneur d&apos;attirer 1&apos;attention de votreExcellence sur la situation qui prevaut actuellement en Irian de.    Votre Excellence connait les motifs allegues par 1&apos;Angleterre, pour justifier sonintervention dans la guerre.  Elle n&apos;y participe, d&apos;apres les affirmations solennelleset maintes fois repetees de ses  hommes d&apos;Etat responsables, qu&apos;afin de sauvegarderles droits de tous les peuples a  la liberte et  de mettre fin au  danger du militarismeprussien, qui les menace.    Depuis le premier jour oil  1&apos;envahisseur anglais a foule le sol de 1&apos;Irlande, il ya plus de sept cents ans, les  Irlandais n&apos;ont jamais cesse&quot; de revendiquer leur droitinalienable a 1&apos;independance et  a hitter pour lui.    Des que la  guerre  rnondiale d&apos;aujourd nui a eclate,  la nation  irlandaise  a denouveau fait entendre sa voix.   Elle a refuse de s&apos;associer a une guerre, qui, entre-prise  par 1&apos;Angleterre pour la  defense dnnterets exclusivement anglais, ne pouvaiten aucune facon dans le cas oil 1&apos;Angleterre en  sortirait  victorieuse servir lesinterets de ITrlande.                                 -H1           *K*           *Jf*    Sinn Eein est pleinement conscient des grandes responsabilit^s lui incombant enraison meme de son triomphe.   La Convention nationale,  convoquee par lui et marquis&apos;est reunie le 25 octobre, 1917,  dans 1&apos;hotel de ville de Dublin,  avait pour objet detracer un programme politique  clair et precis.  II s&apos;agissait  d&apos;elaborer les moyensde realiser ce qui toujours, depuis sa fondation en 1905, a ete le but avere de  SinnFein :  1&apos;expulsion de 1&apos;envahisseur, 1&apos;Irlande aux Irlandais.    La Convention nationale  a  declare que la  proclamation  du  Gouvernementprovisoire de la  republique irlandaise, en date du 24 avril, 1916, continue a  existervalablement en droit, et elle a reitere solennellement le principe d&apos;apres lequel aucunGouvernement etranger  ne puisse legalement slmmiscer, a  un titre quelconque,  dansles affaires de la nation irlandaise souveraine et independante.  Elle a affirme le droit  de l&apos;Irlande a se faire representer au congres futur  de  la paix.  Elle a exigeque la forme de gouvernement librement choisie par le peuple irlandais dans sa vastemajorite,  c&apos;est-a-dire la republique entierement independante, soit  protegee contretoute   attaque  ulterieure  au  moyen d&apos;une  garantie internationale,  a laquelleparticiperaient tous les Etats civilises.  Et elle proceda a 1&apos;election de son  bureaucomme suit:    President: M. Edouard de Valera.  Vice-Presidents : P. Michel 0&apos;Flanaghan,M. Arthur Griffiths. Tresoriers: MM. Cosgrave et Ginnell.  Secretaires: MM. AustenStack et Darrel Figgis.    Un comite executif de 24 personnes (dont 4 femmes) fut egalement elu.    Etant donne le fait que le  Gouvernement anglais persiste  a isoler  Irlande dureste du monde civilise,  a empecher que la voix de la nation irlandaise reclamant lameme justice et la meme Hberte pour elle que  pour la Belgique ou la Serbie  se fasseentendre,  les soussignes estiment etre de leur imperieux devoir de  porter les  faitsci-devant  detailles a la  connaissance  de votre Excellence,  afin que votre Excellencepuisse de cette maniere s&apos;informer de la veritable situation existant en Irlande.    Nous prions votre Excellence  de bien vouloir  agreer 1&apos;expression de notre con-sideration la plus distinguee.    Pour le Bureau de  Stockholm  des &apos;&apos; Amis de la Liberte Irlandaise &apos;&apos; :                                (Signe)       T.  ST. JOHN GAFFNEY,                    . Ancien Consul general des fitats-Unis a Dresde et Munich.                                (Signe)       G. CHATTERTON-HILL,                            Ancien Privatdozent a VUniversite de Geneve.                           La Republique irlandaise.    En convoquant tout le monde civilise  a  prendre part a  une conference inter-nationale  ayant pour but  d&apos;etablir  les conditions dJune  paix  durable, le  Conseildes ouvriers et des soldats russes  a  proclame loyalement,  en  termes admirables, savolonte pacifique.  Uhe condition primordiale de durabilite  de la paix doit  etre,de 1&apos;avis meme du Conseil, la  reconnaissance du  droit de tous les peuples  a  fixereux-memes leurs destinees, car 1&apos;oppression et 1&apos;exploitation economique d&apos;un peuple,sources naturelles et intarissables  des soulevements continuels, des guerres futures,sont incompatibles avec  Tetablissement d&apos;un etat de paix durable entre les nations.    La plus simple logique,  la justice la plus elementaire, exigent que le principefondamental du  droit  de libre disposition des peuples,  reconnu comme legitime,
579soit naturdlement et  raisonnablement applique a  tous  les pays sans distinction.Aucun pays ne  possede plus que  VIrlande ce  droit legitime de revendication a1&apos;autonomie. v    Differents motifs  plaideut ici  en faveur de ses reclamations:  l0 les qualitypsychiques du  peuple  irlandais; 20 les proprieles physiques du sol de 1&apos;lrlande etleur exploitation au seul profit de 1&apos;Angleterre; 30 la situation geographique dupays;  40 les circonstances de son developpement historique.                            La Voix de VIrlande.    Pendant la guerre mondiale actuelle, la voix de 1&apos;Irlande s&apos;est elevee solennel-lement a  trois  reprises differentes :     D&apos;abord a New-York, les 4 et 5 mars, a 1&apos;occasion du Congres national  desIrlandais d&apos;Amerique.  Ce Congres national, convoque en vue de trouver les moyensd&apos;aider 1&apos;Irlande a  recouvrer son independance  apres  la guerre,  s&apos;est constitue&quot; enorganisation  nationale  independante sous  ce  titre:  &quot; Les  Amis  de  la  liberteirlandaise.&apos;5   Le  representant  europeen  de  cette  organisation   des  Irlandaisd&apos;Amerique est actuellement M. T. St. John  Gaffney, ci-devant consul generald&apos;Amerique a Munich.  Dans la seance de cloture du Congres, a New-York, k laquelleassistaient 3,000 personnes, une resolution a ete prise  au milieu de demonstrationsimposantes d&apos;enthousiasme.  Cette  resolution, qui prendra dans 1&apos;Histoire le nom dedeclaration d&apos;indepen dance irlandaise, s&apos;adresse aux Puissances pour leur demanderde reconnaitre VIrlande comme nation independante.  On y lit entre autres choses:&quot; Nous en appelons  aux Puissances pour reconnaitre que VIrlande est une tie euro-peenne, et non  une He anglaise, et pour apprecier le fait que V independance completede VIrlande d&apos;avec VEmpire britannique est la condition essentielle et indispensablede la liberte des mers.&quot;    l&apos;Irlande eleva une seconde fois la voix lors du soulevement pendant  la semainede Paques 1916 et par la proclamation du Gouverneiment provisoire de la Republiqueirlandaise.    Enfin, le  19  avril 1917, la voix de 1&apos;Irlande  a retenti  encore  une fois  dans1&apos;assemblee des  delegues du  parti republicain  irlandais,  convoquee par le comteGeorge Plunkett.   Cette  reunion,  tenue  k 1&apos;hotel de ville de  Dublin,  adopta al&apos;unanimite et avec  de frenetiques applaudissements une resolution d&apos;apres laquelle :l0 L&apos;Irlande constitue une nation  separee  et reclame en consequence d&apos;etre repre-sentee a la Conference de la Paix, attendu que cette  Conference  aura le devoird&apos;assurer aux  peuples la liberte qu&apos;ils reclament, et  de garantir en general les droitsdes petites natidhs; 20 la  volonte du peuple irlandais souverain  fait seul loi,  et lepeuple irlandais est  legitimement libre d&apos;executer ses decisions sans obstacle etsans aucune immixtion etrangere quelconque.    La voix de 1&apos;Irlande n&apos;aura pas retenti en vain.  Elle trouvera son echo aupresdes vrais amis de la  liberte&apos; dans tous les pays.  Mais c&apos;est surtout a la vaillantedemocratic russe que l&apos;Irlande adresse  sa legitime revendication de  pouvoir elle-meme decider  de son  sort et de ne  pas servir plus longtemps d&apos;instrument aux vuesde 1&apos;imperialisme britannique!APPENDIX C.EXTRACTS FROM  A STATEMENT OF IRELAND&apos;S CASE BEFORE THE      POWERS TO  BE ASSEMBLED  IN A PEACE CONFERENCE.    Ireland,  a sovereign State,  appeals  to the  nations  to support its claim for admission to  the  Peace Conference,  in order  that  she may  there  demand theestablishment and recognition of her place among the free nations of the world.                             Grounds of Appeal.    The grounds on which this  appeal was based were set forth at great length.They  are summarised in the following extracts:     1. Because Ireland  is one of the four ancient and sovereign States of Europe.This  was established  among the European Powers at the Council of Constance,anno  1417.  There the question of  precedence arose between the legates of Charles      [5056]                                                          I
 the Sixth, King of France, and the legates of Henry the Fifth, King of England. The latter, abandoning any claim in respect of the Kingdom of England, put forward a claim in respect of the Kingdom of Ireland,  which they pretended and assumed has  been  transferred to England.....     The  King of England  made good the  case of the  nation of  Ireland  to. be considered the third in precedence of the  four  ancient and sovereign States of Europe;  and his  legates took precedence of the  legates of the King of France accordingly.....     2. Because for over a thousand years Ireland exercised her full sovereign status, and for another  five hundred years, during  which time  the full exercise  of that sovereignty was frustrated,  her sovereign status was recognised by the European Powers,  and  its  re-establishment  made the subject  of  negotiation and treaty by certain of those Powers.  For until certain  predatory adventurers, who admitted Henry the Second, King of England, as their feudal lord, made an incursion into Ireland, anno 1169, and were followed two years thereafter by their king, no question has ever been conceived of Ireiand&apos;s sovereign status.....     3. Because  Ireland has  never  surrendered her  sovereign  status, no  Power possessing title by conquest,  by compact, or by treaty to exercise Irish sovereignty; aud because,  therefore, the sovereignty of Ireland exists in suppression, the exercise of it being prevented by external force.....     4. Because the  conscious will of  the  Irish nation  for  the  restoration  of  the exercise of its sovereignty has been asserted in every generation since the suppression- sion, and  has been again asserted during the present war.  Since the suppression of Irish sovereignty and the wanton  elimination of Irish  polity and culture, and the attempted destruction  of  all literary and historical traces of Ireland&apos;s  ancient greatness, at  and about  the opening years of the sixteenth century, Ireland has never been in any other than a state of war for  the recovery of these things, and for a recovery of the sovereign freedom in which they were once  comprised.  Of all the years that have passed  since then, not a year  has passed that has not seen that war maintained in thought or by  deed.  At periodic intervals that war has  taken the form  of  an armed  rising-out that has infallibly  declared  its  end to be  the achievement  of Ireland&apos;s absolute and entire freedom.   In the intervals between each such rising-out the nation has lain stricken  from  the last attempt and  has prepared  for the next.  It is now a solemn charge and tradition from generation to generation that each generation shall in its day make  another attempt, however hopeless the chances, in order to carry the war forward until the day when Ireland shall take her place among the free and sovereign nations of the world according to her ancient right.  During this European war this  tradition has been seen fulfilled, and  of all the small nations  whose cases  will  arise for attention at the  Peace Conference meeting  to conclude the problems  it  has raised Ireland will be the only one who has  of her own initiative arisen with arms in her hands to strike for  her sovereign  freedom.    5. Because Ireland  by history,  by culture,  and  by  language is a distinctive, individual, and separate nation.....    6. Because  Ireland possesses  within  herself  all  the moral  and material constituents of independent statehood.....    7. Because the geographical position of Ireland now renders the restoration of her independent sovereignty essential to the peaceful development of Europe and  the world  in  general, since an  aggressive maritime Power  controlling  Ireland will dominate  the Atlantic Ocean, will control ingress and egress thereto  and therefrom, will control ingress and egress to and from other seas, and so will make impossible that freedom of the seas  upon which the future peace of the world will depend.   Even as before,  in times past, the peace of the world and balance of power have made  the restoration of sovereignty in other small nations a vital question among the Powers, so now the revolution of time has raised the question of  the suppressed sovereignty of Ireland into one  of  deep significance for  the Powers.  The  world has turned westward. For Europe the  Americas have come  into a  striking new importance&quot;. For  the  Americas the  affairs  of  Europe  have  become weighted  with a new significance.   Between them  lies the Atlantic; but  neither can use the Atlantic to reach the  other without coming within range  of the sudden swift activities of any fleet of warships  that can avail themselves of the  ports  and harbours of Ireland. Even as the Atlantic is the only rapid means of communication between Europe and America, so Ireland,  lying where and as she does, holds the key to the Atlantic.  Any great naval Power having at its free use and disposal the ports and harbours ofIreland can at any time  interrupt that communication, to north, to south, or to west.
 Any great naval Power, therefore,  controlling Ireland can at any moment it feels so disposed abrogate the freedom of the seas at their most strategic point, in spite of whatever device by which it might  be thought that that freedom could  otherwise be achieved, and can do so against any other combination of Powers.   Any great naval Power, therefore, dominating Ireland must become the dictator of the  world, since sea-power is world-power, and other Powers must live at its behest or charity.  Such an active irritant in the world&apos;s affairs must infallibly lead to future wars, to pluck that Power from an overweening place achieved through an accidental geographical advantage, especially when it is seen that that advantage exists by crushing the moral rights of the sovereign nation of Ireland.  The neutralisation of Ireland,  however, by the restoration of the exercise of its sovereign nationhood, cancels all this.  The neutralisation  of Ireland will ensure in great measure the neutralisation  of  the Atlantic; will ensure, that is  to  say,  the  freedom of the  seas at their most strategic point  (no  other  great sea  being equally  commanded  at its  angle  of communication, and no other great sea  being of equal importance for international communication) by the single act that gives a long-delayed justice to an oppressed nation.  Moreover, Ireland is well endowed to protect and ensure that neutralisation once granted.  The cost of the expensive administrative machinery by which she is held and oppressed, and the price of which is taxed on her, turned from that immoral purpose  would provide a fleet of  small craft,  submarine  and  supramarine, with which to defend her shores;  and the sufficiency of such small craft for defensive and offensive operations has now been proved.  The coast of Ireland is surrounded by hills and  high ground, from which batteries could bring warships within range long before they could themselves be governed.  And the railways of Ireland have been planned by the Power that suppresses the sovereignty of Ireland, not, as first devised, with a- view to developing the resources of  the country,  but with a view to  its military and naval defence.  For it is not the desire of the Irish nation to aid any  Power in hostile operations  against another,  when  once  her  sovereign  freedom is  established and ensured.     8. Because most of the great Powers in the present European  War, which the peace conference  is to terminate and conclude, have publicly declared that  they are contending for the right of small nations to be free, and to decree and continue their government  for themselves  without fear or dictation from other more  powerful nations.  On this ground the United States of America have lately  entered the war to further the principles enunciated by their President. ....     9. Because,  particularly, the Power that  now suppresses  the sovereignty of Ireland has declared that it is fighting in this war for the procurance, the assertion, and  the defence of the freedom  of small nations.....     10. Lastly because of the law  of God, Who created all things free not bond, and  Whose will it cannot be that a hard and hurtful bondage should continue that must inevitably lead to hatred and  the renewed  shedding of blood.   He is  the only sovereign; but  He has endowed nations and men with that attribute of Himself. Therefore they must aspire to that  sovereign freedom by the law He has implanted in them; and they must hold life as  a cheap thing in comparison with the prompting of that law.   Until they  have  seen sovereign freedom,  His creatures have not fulfilled the life He gave them.....     Then follows a very lengthy historical, financial, and statistical statement ofan extreme Sinn Fein character.
