This Doc-simer (P 8872)          From  Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department.             7123       ;                       loth December 1920.                              (Received 16th, 8 p.m.)   &apos;  Priority A.&apos;       &apos;    :                   &apos;  ,          ;              &apos;   *.     1431  S.  Your  telegram  of 3rd  November,  3029.   Proposed treaty with Afghanistan,.   As  regards&apos;  clause  -1  (h), trade with  Afghanistan, is  at  present carried  on   road,  and  such  traffic  is  excluded  from  provisions   of  draft Contention  on freedom&apos;  of  transit.   Afghanistan  may, however,  be  linked  up sooner  or   later   by  rail  with India,   and  if   and  when,  this  occurs,  the,. Convention,  if it is. adopted by a general Conference of  members of the League of&apos; Nations, and adhered to  by  Afghanistan  (vide:  clause 6 of draft), and  ratified by India, should apply.  There is,  however, we believe,  no. prospect  that Afghanistan will, within any period, which we. can foresee, adhere to Convention,  since,  even if  she (? had) through railway between India and Persia  or  Central Asia, .(?  she  would) almost certainly refuse to give up (? transit) dues on which (? she) largely; depends.&apos; (? Question)  is, therefore,  (? really)  academic   We &quot;are willing,, however, to enter (? amendment) of the clause on lines suggested in para. 1.4 of  Mr. Shuckburgh&apos;s letter to Board of Trade (? of)  3rd November, but should apparently have to insert words &quot;and Afghanistan &quot;&apos; between words &quot; India &quot; and &quot; ratify &quot; in proposed amendment. As to clause 4 (? i) we share your objections to  the first two of the alternative courses indicated in  para. 8 of Mr.  Shuckburgh&apos;s letter, and consider that the third alternative is obviously  the one to follow..  (? If any) foreign Powers were to raise  any claim, we would have strong practical arguments in the length of land frontier and the smallness of the trade  involved, which would (?  make the) levy of any such duties impro(it able, and the fact that we are undeniably only continuing existing practices.&apos;   We  accept, if you insist on it, the proposed.amendment to the proviso in clause  4(j), although we are not clear as to object of prohibiting exports to the  numerous countries who have not signed  Hague Convention; and  it will be very difficult  to  explain  object of amendment  to the Afghans.
