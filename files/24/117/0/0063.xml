This letter will be submitted, to the Cabinet by kir     Robert Horne.^   The Committee recommend that such a     letter be sent -          (1) by the president of the Board of Trade to the              federation of British Industries, the              -associated Cha hers of Commerce, the National              Union of Manufacturers and as many individual              firms as possible, as are not covered by the              above Associations;          (2) Letters in similar terms  mutatis mutandis will              be sent by the hamster of Labour to the Joint              Industrial Councils and to the Trade Unions              forming the constituent bodies of the Trade              Union Congress;          (3) by the Minister of Health to all Local              Authorities in England and &quot;Aales-;          (4) by the Secretary of Scotland to Looal Authorities              in o cotland:          (5) by the Chief Secretary in respect of Ireland.(2)  The Committee also recommend that a-statement be issued     to the press on the terms set out in the Appendix.(3)  It has been brought to the notice of the Committee that     Railwaymen are getting, not merely the wages for a six     days1 jerking week, but also draw overtime in addition, as                                                    a
     a normal part of their wages, which in effect really     adds 12-!fo to their weekly wage.   It is suggested that     if this overtime were put at the disposal of their less     favoured fellow workmen who are at present unemployed,     some 50.000  additional men mitfht be taken on.   It is     recognised that this can only be done with the consent     of the Railway Onions,  This suggestion is made without     the knowledge of the Liinistor of Transport, and the     Committee fettl that they cannot make a definite     recommendation in his absence,  and accordingly put     forward merely the proposal fox tne consideration of     the Cabinet at which he will be preLent.(4)  The attention of the Committee has also been drawn to     the fact that overtime has been paid to a very consider-     able extent in the Postal services and they therefore     suggest that the- Postmaster General should add temporary     staff so as to avoid the payment of overtime *                            (i:ntd.-  L.WJ8. 2, Whitehall Gardens,O 28th December, 19200
                   API1 BM D I X.     The Cabinet hat decided that as far as possible allthe industrial establishments of the Government shall beplaced on short time in order to provide employment for thegreatest possible number of workpeople,  both to avoid further reductions in the establishment and to absorb some of those whose employment has been terminated^   The Government are alsoasking employers cf labour throughout the country ^includingLocal Authorities as well as commercial undertakings) to takea similar course, rather than to reduce the number employedby dismissals.     An appeal is being made to the Erade Unions to co-operate in this endeavour to tide over the period of trade depression.It is hoped by this means to spread the amount of work availableover the largest number of people and thereby not only avoid further discharges but also to make it possible for some ofthose v/ho have been paid off to be re-engaged,
