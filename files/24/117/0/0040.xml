(This  Document iff. the  Prorwrtv r*f                         His Grit--:&quot;  4                                -    &quot;&quot;169HALL   &apos;^^)      From Secretary of State to  Viceroy, Foreign Department,                                *   20th December 1920.          Priority. A.          4102.  Secret Afghan Treaty.   My telegram of 3rd November, 3029.  &apos;Replies of      Board of  Trade and Foreign Office  to India Office letter, P. 7300 of  3rd  November,      have been sent  by mail of  9th  December.  Board  of  Trade agree in third course of      action suggested by this Office in para. 8 in regard to possible complaints of  infririge-      ment of most-favoured-nation clauses, but suggest advantage  of  so wording customs      clause in Afghan treaty as to refer specifically to importation by land iroin Afghanistan      into India.  This seems&apos; desirable.   They also agree to modification of clause 4 (h)      suggested in para.  14 of India Office letter.   Board of Trade  and Foreign  Office      concur as to desirability of inviting Afghanistan to adhere to Arms Traffic Convention,      but  suggest  advisability  of  providing  in Treaty for  some measure of control, by      Government of India  over importation in case convention is not ratified or lapses,      provided this can be done  without  driving Afghanistan to turn to Russia for supply      of arms.   I agree.
