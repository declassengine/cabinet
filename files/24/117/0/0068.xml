BBMORAffiJUM OB HAVAI POLICY.-    341.   For  0 years before tho TCar the Navy League continually ..Impressod upon the publio tho necessity of maintaining astrong Navy for the defence of the Empire, more especially asthe German menaco to civilisation bocamo apparent.2.   With the disappearance of tho German Fleet, the worldTsnaval position is changed.   -3.   Today civilisation is not threatened by any maritimepower.4.   There is no alternative to competitive building of ships of war except an international naval agreement, and this applies to whatever type of ship is.considered to dominate  the seaposition for tho moment, for there is increasing certainty that now inventions will render obsolete, at shorter notice,all existing or contemplatod ships, but this will simply divertcompetition Into new channels, as it always has done.5.   Tho term &quot;Command of tho Seas&quot; conveys to an ill-informodpublic simply the possession, at any time, of the greatestnumber of ships, but tho embracing of the doctrine  by any country either invites competition by, or demands acquiescencefrom, other countries, since the High Seas are. neutral in times of peace.6.   (The use of the terms &quot;defence&quot;,&quot;security&quot;, and &quot;adequate$avyn necessitates comparison with other navies, and mustresult In competition.7.   In the Spring&apos; of 1917, when the danger from the tUI Boatswas at its highest, there was given to the English and Americanseamen especially, an opportunity of bearing romarheblewitness to the influence of that sea spirit of brotherhoodwhich is their common birthright and heritage; this was undoubtedly one of the most significant lessons of the War.8.   The Hsvy League holds  that the time is now speciallyfavourable for taking advantage of this lesson, and that itIs for these two nations to give the lead in proposing aConference between all thoso powers whose geographical
positions impose upon them the guardianship of the seas, and to decide in what way this joint guardianship may best be carried out.

9. There is no doubt that the spirit which makes for co-operation is to be found in greater measure amongst seamen than among the members of any other calling, for their oldest traditions are built on it. For this reason it is held that the proposed Conference should be largely composed of seamen who have held high commands  at sea.

10. Let it never be forgotten that peace must be paid for as wall as war, but the sacrifices involved are generally avoided by describing them as "visionary", or "idealism" and beyond the range of those practical politics which have brought the world to its present position.

11. It would seem, however, that science, as applied to destructive agencies, is forcing us ever more rapidly to the conclusion that the highest idealism of all is the only practical alternative to world suicide.

12. The Navy League holds that the sea story in the past of Britain and the United States imposes on them mutually the duty of attempting to render to the world a still greater service, and for this reason it urges that the invitation to the proposed Conference should come from the two great Anglo-Saxon Nations jointly.
