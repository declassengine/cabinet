THE BAVARIAN AND EAST PRUSSIAN SELF-DEFENCE FORCES.

The following note has been communicated by the Foreign Office to the President of the Inter-allied Commission of Control for the Army, - General Nollot.

December 22nd, 1920.

General,

In the note of December 11 the point of view is adopted that the German Government is obliged, in accordance with the Treaty of Ver?illes, to dissolve all self-defence organisations, on the ground that it would be possible to utilise such organisations to facilitate mobilisation, and that they therefore come under article 178 of the treaty. Article 178, however, does not forbid all measures which could faciliate mobilisation, but only such as have this as their object (tendant Ã  une mobilisation). Facilities for mobilisation could, for example, be found in the keeping of lists of inhabitants, or of tax-payers, or any other registers, and in every expansion of the railway system. The criterion is, however, whether such a facility is to be regarded as the real object of the




                                               &quot;...  348the measure.  Tho banding together of the  inhabitantsfor tlieix $ol.*-4,j.&apos;: *  .00 is just as little  to  bo  soregarded as the above-mentioned examples.    The GormanGovernment oan therefore not admit that the  existenceof these self-defence organisations of itself constitutes a breach of the peace treaty.   They must, cn the  con-trary, maintain the  position, which they expressed intheir note of december 9, that tho toleration orthe dissolution of self-defence organisations which have no military charaotor is purely a matter of internalGerman interest, and they repeat that such organisationsare only to be regarded as temporary emergency measures and must be dissolved, as soon as circumstances permit,if enly because they infringe the supreme authority of.the Government.  Ho consideration whatever will begiven to any possible desire on tho part of the organ-isations themselves to prolong thoir existence, or toany steps  taken by  them  to that end.. For the  rest, ithas hitherto proved impossible to  do terrains the basisof the allegation that tho Bavarian  Einwohnerwehr iscontemplating  an activity extending  Into  19E8  and beyond.   The Central Authority of tho  Bavarian defence forces  has no  knowledge  of  any such declaration.      The Control Commission consider,  on the  ground of reports which they  possess  of certain self-defence organisations, that they are justified in assuming  that these organisations, contrary to the declaration  of the German Government,  have a military character., and that they are connected with the military authorities                                                  in                          - Z -
in a manner forbidden by the peace treaty.  Theyrely on certain provisions in tho &quot;rules for theunion of Bavarian Einwohnerwehr&quot;, and on an orderof the staff of tho first division in Koenigsberg,which has reference to tho East Prussian looalpro t ec ti o n force f 0 rtswehr)*     In Bavaria it was at one time provided that,in the event of the Sinwohnerwehr and Boichswehrbeing simultaneously employed against disorder,  theformer should place themselves under the orders  ofthe loader of the military detachments.   The soleobject of sections  9A and 10A of tho rules of theBavarian Binwohnorwehr was to ensure, in that event,tho necessary contact with the military commendvThat is the only possible interpretation to be givento these provisions,  because tho only function ofthe Einwohnerwehr is to supplement the police.  Hoorganic connection between the Einwohnerwohr and thoHeiohswohr was established by these sections.     The provisions in question have, however, inthe meanwhile become obsolete.  Since tho re-arganisa-tion of tho police, a group of Einwohnerwohr called on for duty is under the sole orders of the detachment of Landespoliaoi on the snot.  Contact with tho  localpolice organisation has therefore taaen the place ofthat co-operation with the military command which was contemplated in the regulations.  The provisions Inquestion will as soon as possible be formally with-drawn in accordance with the regulations.                                              In
     Iii the case of the Bast Prussian Qrtswehr theorder of the Obor-praesidont of August 7,  by whicn  that organisation was called into being,  contemplates  no connection with tho military commando  Nevertheless,  in.fact, in accordance with the distribution  of duties which took: effect in the first divisional  staff  on November 10,certain offioors were designated,  who, in  the,event oftho OrtSwohr being called out, would keep  liaison withthorn through the oivil author!tioso   This  provision isnow cancelled, so that only the civil authorities caninfluence the method of employment of the  local andfrontier defence forcos (Ortswohr  and Gronzwehr).     The arguments based upon a connection betweenthe Bavarian and East Prussian defence forces,  on the onehand, and the army (Reichswehr) on the other, thereforefall to the ground.     In the note of December 11 it is stated thatthe retention of the self-defence  organisations after their disarmament cannot be justified by any object of purely internal policy, inasmuch as, deprived of  theirweapons, they can no longer contribute ofiaictively  tothe preservation of order.  The disarmament of the  self-defence organisations which Germany  is, under the Spaprotocol, obliged to carry out, consists,  however,  as isthe case with the general disarmament of the population,solely in the surrender of weapons of war.     Moreover,, the mere act of combination for self--.defence, coupled with the certainty  of being able to count at need upon onefs neighbours, tends largely  to counteract that sense of insecurity  under, which the population
     .  labours.          The fear expressed in the note, that other  ;.German States might claim the same exceptional treat-ment as Bavaria and East trussia in respect of thedisarmament of the self-defence organisations isgroundless.   AS regards the other parts of the  rnpire,the disarmament of the self-defence organisations, asstipulated in the peace treaty, will be carried: out inthe near future.  It is only in Bavaria and east prussia that exceptional local circumstances,  explained in detail in the note of the 9th  December, make itimpossible to proceed with the same expedition.          In that part of my note of December 9 which.described conditions in Bavaria I touched upon.the&apos;-communist danger.   The assumption that Germany is no  -longer threatened by that danger is unfortunatelyerroneous.    I did, it is true, express the opinionthat the participation of Russian delegates in theCongress of the German Independent socialist party atKalle had shattered many illusions.  My hopes,  however,did not go so far as a belief that danger from that quarter dan now be regarded as negligible.  If my  .statements made in conversation on liovember 9  havebeen interpreted in any other sense than this,  theyhave been misunderstood.          It would be a mistake to infer&apos; from the  -number of communist vctes cast in Bavaria, that thenumber of active combatants in possible disorderswould not exceed the number of the communist voters.                                             The
The num.bejsto be  reckoned with,  were a few radicalelements to succeed in exciting the mob,  would be far greater.  The danger increases with the economicstringency, which assumes especially formidable proper-tions towards the end of the economic year.-  That theregular forces available to meet  the danger would notattain the strength mentioned in  the note of necember lljis clear from my note of Jccember 9,          Nor can the co nclus ions drawn from the state-ments made by the ober prasident of-the province of BastPrussia on the 8th and 14th of September be maintained.:At that time the Russians had been defeated, and theimmediate danger of an attack on East Prussia had die-&apos;-appeared,          It therefore was a question only of searchingfor Russian soldiers hidden in the woods,, and of guardingthem when interned at concentration centres, until theycould be removed.  The ober prasident said that he consider-ed it sufficient for these purposes that the regular forces should be supported by 3,000 men of the local and frontierguards,  ?rontier guards to the number of 2000 could be told off to search the woods; 1,000 local guards to guard theinterned Buasians. . But from this  it,, of course,, cannotbe inferred that a  reinforcement of the regular forces by only 3,000 men would be enough to canvassed off the dangers-threatening the province.  Moreover, it must be borne  inmind that the German Government had at that time draftedfour additional battalions of Reichswehr into East Prussia.                                               In/
          In ord;,r to give the Inhabitants both of east Prussia and Javaria a sense of security, andto protect thorn from dangers v.hich ar^ far fr*mimaginary, it is not possible at this moment toproceed to the complete disarmament of the self-defence organisations in those parts.          The German government can therefore onlyrepeat tj the allied powers the re* uest which they made in their note of the 9th December,  They begleave, while asking you to bring that re cuest andthe. present note to the notice of the governments represented by you, to draw attention to the factthat up to the present date the following arms notbelonging to the sell&quot;-defence organisations haveboen delivered,  and for the most part have alreadybeen destroyed:   791 guns, trench mortars andother siortars; 9,133 machine guns;  1,373,730rifles, carbines and pistols,  further, In accord-anoe with the disarmament law of August 7, 8,404machine guns and 301, 53 rifles have heen notified.These figures inolude the armament of the self-defence organisations.  Of the maohine guns thusnotified far the greater part has already been delivered and rendered useless, and this beforeDeoember 11*  This holds good also for Hanover.  Inwurtemburg the self-defenoo organisations alreadypossessed no more mackine guns.  Of the riflesnotified tho number actually handed in is already considerable.   The German Govern neat believe them-selves justified in expecting that this result oftheir earnest endeavours will be appreciated.                                         The /
          The further collection of the light armamentof the self-defence organisations is in progress.  TheGerman Government will also do all in their pcwer to observe the time limit given in thsar note cf December9.   They have no reason to doubt that they will suo-ceed in this.          The methods adopted by the German Government inthe whole process cf disarmament are the only ones which,in view of the circumstances,  could have been success-ful.  They hope that the allied Governments will recog-nise this.fSg&amp;oj  DR SIMONS.
