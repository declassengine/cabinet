 the Document is the Property of                419His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,630th December, 1920.SHORT  TIME  IN  THE  DOCKYARDS.Further Memorandum for the Cabinet by the  Civil             Lord of the Admiralty.         At the adjourned meeting of the Admiralty IndustrialCouncil to-day the Trades Union side stated that they hadnot accepted the principle of short-time, as had been under-stood by the Official side yesterday.  They stated that according to the principles of &quot;Whitleyism,!, and also accord-ing to the Resolution of the Council of the 6th December, 1919,they should havo been consulted on a question of such import-ance as this before a definite decision had been arrived at.They therefore asked for an adjournment in order to consulttheir constituents at the Yards.         The Official side were not prepared to agree that itwas possible to discuss the principle of the acceptance orrefusal of a Cabinet decision, but offered to adjourn theimposition of the Order until the 17th January, in order thatthe Trades Union side might have an opportunity of discussing the details and methods of operating short-time with theirconstituents.         The Trades Union side declined to accept this formula,and threatened resignation if they were not allowed to have a free hand in consulting their men.         Upon this, the Official side, after discussion, agreedto the simple adjournment of the meeting until the 11th January,without however giving any undertaking that a variation of theGovernment decision would bo considered.         Prom remarks that were lot fall by the Trades Unionsi^e, it seemed probable that the concession to allow them todiscuss the natter with their constituents would result in thedecision being adopted smoothly,  although of course vath con-siderable distaste.         The Trades Union delegates made it clear that they didnot threaten their resignation on the question of short-time,but entirely on the constitutional question of their rightto be consulted before any definite decision was arrived at.(Signed)       0N3L0W.             30.12.20.
