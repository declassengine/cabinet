Q                   Kote &quot;by tho Secretary of State for War;&quot;                 I am not satisfied with this telegram,.which appears            to have a dilatory character..   It will certainly nocessi-            tate a oonsiderahle increase in the Estimates I have            presented to the Cabinet.   I am having this increase            worked out and I will then ask for a new meeting of the            Committee which has usually dealt with Mesopotamian matters.            I fear we shall find ourselves confronted with a very            stubborn resistance from all those on the spot, both            military and civil,   I am telegraphing again to General            Haldane.                                               (intd)  W.S.Ci.  -       War Office,  S.WV           December 22nd. 1920*
                           s E o n S.T.Unparaphrased.Telegram from;-  General Haldane, Baghdad.          to     So of So                                         Despatched:- 14*25  21*12.20                                         Received:-   09.15  S3,12*20.OLE Ax? 0?HB LIKE,.X.. 945 cipher December 21st,,  Personal your Q7260 December 17th,la     In my  opinion 1 division  could hold a frontier in the BasrahYillayet securing  a foothold  in  the country and covering theoilfieldsc    Tho Basrah Yillayet however  is the most unhealthypart  of the country..2.     The  earliest probable  time  for the commencement  of  thowithdrawal  from Persia will be  the end  of April but  this may boslightly  advanced  or  retarded by climatic conditions,3,,     A  detailed  table  will require  considerable  time  and consideration to work out and the knowledge  of proposals by Commanders  and their  staffs^    An outline time table is as followss        Withdrawal from Persia and preliminary work of evacuation of materials  from northern Mesopotamia complete  in October 1921? (.) Evacuation of ICirkuk and Mosul areas commence September complete December  1921.   Evacuation of Baghdad Villayet  and withdrawal to Basrah Villayet commence January 1922 complete March 1922. 4o     Dates  are necessarily arbitrary depending on amount of and efficiency of transport and river fleet also on  ocean shipping available and are based on assumption of prevalence of peace conditions. 5,     My responsibility for the protection and  assistance of civilian population desiring evacuation will require to be defined and it is possible that if this evacuation-were  on a large scale the movement  of troops would be impeded and time required extended in consequence.
