I  am  also  Bending    copies of the resolutions to the President of the Board of    Trade and the Minister for labour.          As you are no doubt- aware, the membership  of ray    Federation ie composed of one-and-a-half million of male  and    female workers,  employed in the &quot;Key11 and general industries    of the- Country.    I would point out to you, therefore, that    my affiliated. Unions arc hit very severely &quot;by the present    lack of: employments   In these circumstances, I  aub^it,    on behalf cf my Executive Council, that if there io  any    intention onime part- of the Government to  consult employers    and workpeople before adopting any schemes for the relief    of unemployment, my Federation, having regard to its membership    and the severity with which it is hit by the  present  Industrial    crisis, is entitled to be brought into the consideration of  any    schemes which may be on foot,                              -Yours sincerely,he Rt.Hwi.David Lloyd Georgep^.

      At the usual monthly mooting of the Executive  Council  ofthe National Federation of General Workers held to-day,  thefollowing&apos; resolutions were adopted:-    (1)  That we call upon the Government to give effect to  the      practical proposals which the Labour Party has already      put before them in respect to the adoption and financing      of schemes&apos;for tho relief&apos;of unemployment, or  alter-      natively the maintenance of the unemployed and their      dependents *    (2)  That In dur judgment it would be unfair to  the Trade      Unions having membership in other than key industries  to      require each trade to be financially responsible for its      unemployed.  Therefore effective insurance must be on      the lines&apos; of collective risks&apos;  in respect to industries      generally, otherwise restriction will be placed on the      mobility of labour, which would be detrimental to- the      output of commodities,     (3)   That  a special Conference  of representatives of the      Executives&quot;of  the affiliated Unions concerned be       convened  for 11  a,ms Tuesday,  11th January,. 1921.
