1.1.21.part   L    THE   LABOUR    SITUATION.THE  GENERAL  SITUATION. General Survey of the Week.     The industrial  situation lias remained very quiet over the  Christmas season.  A serious strike of miners in the Rhondda district which took place  on the 21st December over an alleged case of victimisation, and which involved some 45,000 men, was temporarily settled on the 27th, by the intervention of the  South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, who have entered into negotiations with the owners.  The threatened strike of theatrical employees was averted on Christmas Eve by a decision of the men to accept  the terms of the Con- ciliation Board.  In connection with the claim of the engineers and shipbuilders for  an advance in wages of Qd. per hour, the central committee of delegates  from all the organising divisions of  trie Amalgamated Engineering Union have decided to call a  representative national conference  of the union in January,  to  discuss the position arising out of the employers&apos; rejection of their claim, and to take  a final decision on the policy to be pursued.     The employment situation continues to he very grave.   The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives have not yet arrived at any decision as regards the proposals of the Government  for the  employment of not less than 50,000 ex-Service men in the building industry, but a conference of the executives  of the affiliated unions has  been summoned for  the 30th December.  This conference will decide whether to accept  or to reject the  proposals on its own authority, or whether to arrange for a ballot vote of the members.  The general situation is being carefully watched; an informal conference was held at Downing Street on Christmas Day, attended by the Minister and Sir Allan Smith, M.P., and Mr. Arthur  Henderson,  M.P., as representing  employers and employed respectively, and at a Cabinet Meeting, held on the 28th, the position was fully discussed in the light of  the opinions expressed on the 25th.    A notice has been issued by the Home Secretary in connection with the provisions of the Women,  Young Persons and Children (Employment) Act, relating to the employment of children in industry, which come into force on the 1st January. On and after that date, it will be illegal to employ any child under the age of 14 years in any industrial undertaking, as defined by the Act, unless the child was already so  employed at that date.  The first step will thus have been taken towards the abolition of  the half-time system.    On the  23rd December, the last day of the Parliamentary session, a large amount of business was concluded.  The Unemployment Insurance (Temporary Provisions Amend- ment) Bill passed its second reading and all remaining stages in the  House of Lords ; and the DyestufTs (Import Regulation) Bill was also read, in this House for the third time and passed.  Amendments to the Agriculture Bill were considered in both Houses, and agree- ment between the Lords and the Commons was reached.  A number of measures received the Royal Assent, including  the Women and Young Persons (Employment in Lead Pro- cesses) Act,  the Women,  Young Persons and Children (Employment) Act, the Housing (Scotland) Act, the Expiring Laws  Continuance Act, the Agriculture  Act, the Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act,  the Juvenile Courts (Metropolis)  Act, and the Unemployment Insurance  (TemporaryTrovisions Amendment)  Act.    The King&apos;s Speech was delivered by the Lord Chancellor to both Houses and Parliament was prorogued until the 15th February, 1921. The Unemployment Position.    The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in Great Britain on the 17th December was 223,394, comprising 222,936 for men and 458 for women.  In addition there were  5,458  policies lodged by short-time  workers, 5,412 for men and 46 for women.   On the 10th December there were 219,933 policies lodged, 219,273 by men and 660 by women.   On the  same date there were 3,901  policies lodged by short-time workers, 3,857 by men and 44 by women.    On the 17th December,  in Great Britain,  285,193  unemployment books, 162,795 for males and 122,398 for  females, remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance
31.1.21.General  Situation-continued.Act.  Compared with the previous week, when there were 140,072 lodged by males and105,842 by females, the increase is 39,279.  In addition there were 172,760 policies lodgedby short-time workers, 04,100 by males and 108,660 by females, an increase on the previousweek of 88,576.    The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges on the 17th december was 628,273.   A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on p. 13.FEATURES   OF  THE  WEEK.General Topics.     Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. The joint committee of coal owners&apos; and miners&apos;representatives, appointed to draft a scheme under Section 18 of the Act, have submittedtheir proposals for the consideration and report of the actuaries.  Both coal owners and miners had applied for complete exclusion from the Act, but this was refused.   The com-mittee then considered proposals, which  had been favoured by a minority of the miners,for a scheme to contract out of the Act.  It is understood that this scheme provides forunemployment benefit of 25*. per week, as well as old age pensions, disablement pensions,and the use of any surplus funds still remaining to improve housing conditions in mining areas.     The Lancashire Weavers&apos;  Amalgamation have also  been considering  a scheme to contract out  of the Act.  For this purpose  a series of meetings of 15 societies connectedwith the Amalgamation have been held at Burnley ;  and a new scale of benefit,  involvingconsiderable changes, has been drawn up.  In the  past, the unions have only paid benefit incases of well-defined stoppages, repairs, &amp;c., but, with a view to making it permissible for the societies to pay benefit in all cases where the operatives would be entitled to State benefit,the original payments are reduced under the new scheme, and spread over a larger numberof stoppages.  The  scheme  is  not meeting  with approval from members of the unions concerned, and in three districts, Burnley, Nelson and  Padiham, it has already been rejected.     Relief of Unemployment. The situation with regard  to unemployment continues to cause great uneasiness.  The measures which the  Government propose to take with a viewto mitigating distress were outlined by the Minister in the House of Commons on the 21stDecember.  They involve the drafting of not less  than 50,000 ex-Service men into thebuilding trades ; the construction of arterial roads; the amendment of the UnemploymentInsurance Act, 1920, by making it possible, up to the 31st March, 1921, for unemployed persons  in  insured  trades  to  receive  8 weeks&apos; benefit irrespective  of the number ofcontributions paid in respect of them; and the establishment of a central committee to administer a  fund of  3,000,000 which will  be allocated  to the local authorities for the inauguration  of relief works.   This committee, which will be known as the unemployment grants Committee, is composed of  Lord St. Davids, chairman; Lord Byng; Sir JamesWatson Stewart,  formerly Lord Provost of  Glasgow; Sir John Ferguson, K.B.E.;  MissWallas of the London County Council; Mr. J. N. Bell, secretary of the National AmalgamatedUnion of Labour;  Mr. F. Palmer; Mr.  P.  J. Pybus ;  and Mr. H. 0. Burgess, assistantto the  General Manager of the London and. North Western Railway, who is representingIreland.   The secretary is Mr.  H. E. Dale, of the Privy Council Office.  It is understoodthat sums to the amount of 30 per cent, of the estimated cost of approved schemes will bepaid out of the fund at the discretion of the committee.     The Labour Party&apos;s recommendations for dealing with the situation were formulatedat a meeting  of the National Executive held on the 15th December.  At this meeting thefollowing resolution was adopted :           &quot; That, in view of the increasing unemployment and the apparent inability of the authorities       to provide work for the unemployed, this National Executive of the Labour Party declares that the       present scandal of innocent starving persons cannot  be allowed to continue, and urges that the       following scheme for the  maintenance of unemployed workers shall, as an emergency  measure, be       put into operation :               &quot; 1. A person for whom no work is available at the Employment Exchanges shall be entitled          to  maintenance.
Features of  the  Week-continued.              &quot; 2. The rate of maintenance (including other benefits) shall be at least 40s. per week for           each man, and 25s. per week for each woman, with additional allowances for dependants.              &quot; 3. Until better provision for the unemployed is made under a new or amended Act, the           scheme  shall be directly provided for by the Government, and in this connection the Committee           would remind the Government of the provisions of the Labour Party Bill for the prevention of           unemployment.&quot;    A deputation from the Parliamentary  Committee of the Trades Union Congress andthe Parliamentary Labour Party visited the Minister on the 16th December, and advocated,inter alia, the payment of out-of-work donation to unemployed persons not covered by theUnemployment Insurance Act, and the provision of  grants to Distress Committees to finance local relief schemes.    The Council of Action met on the 23rd December to review the general situation withregard to  unemployment, and especially to discuss what steps should  be taken to press for the resumption of trade with Russia as the best means of relieving the distress.  they also received a deputation representing the executive of groups of unemployed men who have formed committees in 22 of the London boroughs, and who claim to represent some 250,000unemployed in the London area.    Local authorities representing 33 of the greater towns of England  and Wales met in conference on the 17th December, and decided to send a deputation to the Prime Ministerto urge the immediate provision  of grants-in-aid  to local authorities.   The deputationwas received by the Prime Minister on the  22nd December, and was informed that it wasnot feasible to make such grants  or to increase the amount payable from the fund of theUnemployment Grants Committee.  A similar conference of the mayors of Midland townshas been  convened.    The tendency of the unemployed to organise  distress committees  and manage theirown relief funds and  operations is  very marked, especially in the London boroughs, where,in most cases, offices have been secured  and the situation taken in hand in a businesslikemanner.    Labour and Ireland^ The chief factor in the Irish situation, from the labour point ofview, is the settlement of the railway dispute. This was  effected at a conference of Irishrailwaymen held in Dublin on the 21st December, which was summoned by the executive of the National Union of Railwaymen and attended by delegates representing the branchesaffected by the dispute.  Mr. C. T. Cramp presided over the first part of the proceedings,and Mr. B. Hennessy, of the Irish  Council of the National Union of  Railwaymen, over thesecond part.  A resolution to resume normal working at once, without discrimination asto the class of traffic  tendered or conveyed, provided that no victimisation takes place, wascarried unanimously, and the decision  was immediately conveyed to the Government.The reasons for the  abandonment of the strike  appear to have  been its injurious effecton the economic position of the country, and its failure to achieve any of the objects forwhich it was undertaken.,    The Labour Commission of Inquiry, who have now returned from Ireland, attended ajoint meeting of the Labour Party Executive and the Parliamentary Labour Party on the16th December to report on their investigation of conditions in Ireland.  After hearing theCommission^ statements, the  joint meeting decided that the members should  requestan interview with the Prime Minister.  They were enabled to meet hirn the same evening,and urged that a  further effort should be made to bring about a truce in Ireland, in orderthat negotiations might take place between representatives of the  Government and the elected representatives of the Irish people.Control of Industry.    Railways. In connection with  the unfavourable attitude of the Railway Companies&apos;Association to the proposals of the Ministry of Transport for the re-organisation of therailways,* it should be mentioned  that a joint meeting of the executive  committees of theNational Union of Railwaymen,  the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers  and firemen, and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, has been held, at which it was decided toappoint a joint standing committee of five representatives from each union to watch theposition, and to arrange for joint representation when occasion arises.    The Federation  of British Industries have now published a statement of their viewson the proposals  of the Ministry  of Transport.  Approval of the principle of grouping  is expressed, but this is not to involve the acceptance of the Ministry&apos;s selection of  groups,
nor must the re-organisation be permitted to remove  all competition from the railwayworld.   With regard to finance, management, and the powers of the Ministry of Transport,the Federation are on the  whole in agreement with the official proposals, and they statethat the main object in publishing their views  has  been &quot; to develop,  on the basis of theWhite Paper, and in accord with principles already laid  down by the Federation, a systemof co-operation and mutual responsibility between railways and the community they serve.&quot;Industrial and Other Organisations.    National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. In connection with the Govem-menfs proposals to absorb 50,000 unemployed ex-Service men into the building industry the Federation were requested to meet the Minister on the 20th December for  further discussion.  A full conference of the joint executive councils of the societies affiliated tothe Federation decided, however, that since such a deputation as was proposed would onlybe able  to act in a consultative capacity, no useful purpose would be served by complying with the request, and the Government were asked to communicate their proposals to theFederation, when a further  special  conference would  be  summoned to consider them.The following proposals were accordingly communicated to the Federation* :            (1) That not less than 50,000 ex-Service men be admitted into the industry.           (2) In return for an undertaking to admit and train these men, the Government will grant a sum       of  5 per man to the unions,  2 to be paid when training begins, and the remaining  3 to be paid when       it is completed.           (3) A guaranteed rate of payment for &quot; wet time.&quot;           (4) The unions to consider the advisability of becoming agencies for the administration of the       Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, in order to secure the payment to their members of a larger       amount of benefit than the State scheme provides.    It is understood that the Emergency Committee of the Federation will meet immediatelyafter.  Christmas to discuss these  suggestions, and that,  as the principle of &quot; dilution &quot; is involved, a ballot vote of all the members may be taken.  In any case, a further conferenceof the executive committees of the affiliated unions will be held.     National Union  of Teachers. -The committee appointed by the  executive  of theunion to consider the advisability  of  affiliation with  the  Trades Union  Congress have reported that such affiliation would have the  effect of radically changing the system, ofParliamentary representation at present in force within the union.  Clauses 11  and 14of the constitution of the Congress, relating to Parliamentary candidates, are opposed tothe constitution  of the union.   It is understood that,  although, this obstacle to a  closerrelationship with the  Congress will prevent immediate affiliation, the matter will be re-opened, probably in the near future, as there is  a considerable body of opinion in  the union in favour of this step.    The executive have now appointed a special committee to consider the question of equal pay for men and women.   As a  result  of a  referendum,  the union are officiallypledged in favour of  the  principle, but it  was  nevertheless rejected at  the  specialconferences called to consider the Burnham Report.  In accepting the Report,  the unionaccepted the principle  of discrimination between men and women, and a somewhat anoma-lous position has been created.  Many women teachers are urging the withdrawal of women from the union,  on the ground that the acceptance of the Report  violates the principleestablished by the referendum;  while  men teachers are threatening to withdraw on theground  that the fight for equal pay put up by the union representatives on Lord Burnham&apos;scommittee resulted in  a reduction of the maxima which might have been obtained by themen, had their representatives not been bound  by the result of the referendum.    London Labour Party. A conference under the auspices of the London Labour party and the London Trades Council was held on the 18th December, at the Memorial Hall, todiscuss  a scheme for establishing central headquarters in London for the  London tradeunion and co-operative movements.   Mr. T. E. Naylor,  secretary of the London  Society ofCompositors, presided over the conference, which was attended by delegates from  Londontrade union branches and co-operative societies.  It is proposed to finance the erection ofthe building by loans from trade unions at 5 per cent, interest, the loans to be guaranteed by the  London  Co-operative  Society.   In addition to supplying  offices for their own    * The correspondence  between the Ministry of Labour and the Federation has  been issued as a white paper, Cmd. 1096.
1.1.21.6organisations,  the scheme includes  the provision of a central library, a statistical and information bureau, club rooms, board rooms, &amp;c.; it is also hoped to provide accommoda-tion for trade union and Labour Party delegates coming to London.   The general principlesof the scheme were approved by the conference.    Amalgamated Union  of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional  Workers, Thisunion,  which is an amalgamation of the Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; society of Great Britain and Ireland, the Ship Constructors  and Shipwrights&apos; Association, andthe United Society  of Boiler Makers and Iron and Steel Ship Builders,  has decided  tomake a special effort to organise apprentices in the various trades  represented.  A propor-tional census of the position has recently been taken,  the returns of which show that,  of18,151  apprentices eligible for membership, only 6,042 are actually enrolled in the threesocieties concerned.    The proportion is highest in the  case of the  blacksmiths, and lowestin that of the boilermakers, who have enrolled only 3,633 out of a possible 11,670.   It hasnow been decided to  adopt a  uniform system, based on that which was introduced sometime ago  by the boilermakers.  The ordinary  apprentice scales  of  contributions and benefits will be preserved, but it will also be possible for an apprentice to enter any of thethree societies without becoming eligible  for benefits, by payment of an  entrance fee  of. and of a subscription of 2d. per quarter, in return for which a special card will be issued to him.  The holding of such a card will be treated by the union as an indication that the holder  is a  duly apprenticed worker, and will entitle him to the position of a journeymanon the  completion of his  apprenticeship.  This form of membership will therefore possessconsiderable value, as it  will ensure the recognition of the apprentice, coming out of histime, as a skilled worker.  It is also recommended that, wherever possible, special apprenticebranches should be formed.  Experiments in this direction have been made already, and the branches which exist are  believed to have exercised a valuable educational influence uponthe apprentices concerned.    Amalgamated Managers and Foremen^  Association of Shipbuilding, Iron and SteelEngineering and Manufacturing Trades.-lt is stated  that the Parliamentary Committeeof the Trades Union Congress have come to a provisional decision in favour of the affiliationto Congress of this association, but they desire to submit the matter to the affiliated unionsbefore  making a final decision.  Other similar bodies  which have asked for affiliation  tothe Congress are the National Foremen&apos;s Association of the Engineering and Allied Trades,and the Scottish Foremen&apos;s Protective Association.    National Amalgamated Workers&apos; Union and National  Union of General Workers. Thescheme for the proposed  amalgamation of the National Union of General Workers and thethree unions composing the National Amalgamated Workers&apos; Union, namely, the Workers&apos;Union, the Municipal Employees&apos; Association and the National  Amalgamated Union  ofLabour, was approved at a conference representative of the  unions concerned, held  inLondon on the 21st December.  The proposals will now be submitted to the full executivesof the unions,  and any amendments put forward will be considered at a joint meeting  tobe held early in the New Year.  If agreement is reached at  this meeting, a  ballot votewill probably be taken immediately.    Scottish Horse and Motormerfs Association. The association have decided to take  no part in the proposed fusion of nineteen unions affiliated to the National Transport Workers&apos;Federation, on  the ground that it would involve handing over their funds and giving up their independence and individuality as a Scottish union to an executive with headquarters in England.Trade Union Topics.    Scottish Coal-Cutting  Machinemerts Association. An interesting resolution with regardto the  setting up of output committees, under the terms of the recent agreement betweenthe miners and the Government, was passed at a meeting of the executive of this association on the  11th December.  It declared &quot; that the coal-cutting machinemen of Scotland refuseto be bound by the decisions of any committee on which they had not got direct representa-tion, in view of the fact that  machinemen are the first men involved in  any increase  ofproduction.&quot;    National  Union  of  Textile Workers. The scheme  for  the amalgamation of theGeneral Union of Textile Workers, the National Society of  Dyers and  Finishers, theYeadon,  Guiseley and   District Factory Workers&apos; Union,  the Amalgamated Society
71.1.21.NEGOTIATIONS  AND  DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.    Tramwaymen (National). The executive committee of the United Vehicle workers have approved of the investigation of their claim for an advance in wages of 12s. a weekby a Court of Inquiry, which will be set up by the Minister of Labour, and held in public.The union will discountenance any strike pending the result of the inquiry.* See this Eeport, Vol. II, No. 21, 20th November, p. 583.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 23, 4th December, p. 631. of Stuff and Woollen Warehousemen, the Leeds Cloth Pressers&apos; Society, and the Hudders- field and District Cloth Pressers&apos; Trade, Benevolent and Burial Society, in one organisation to be called the National Union of Textile Workers,* was discussed at a meeting of the execu- tive committees of the unions concerned, held in  Bradford on the 11th December.  Mr. Ben Turner presided.  The proposals, which include the pooling of the whole of the funds of  the six organisations,  and the amalgamation of the health insurance sections, were considered in detail.  The meeting approved  the scheme, and a  sub-committee was ap- pointed to draft a ballot paper for a vote of the members.    National Union of Railwaymen. A difficulty  has arisen  between the union and the Standing Committee of General Managers over the question of the  Appeal Boards which it is proposed to set up on each railway, to enable the various departments to hear appeals lodged by the men in connection with the grading agreements made during the past year. The managers contend that there  should be one representative of the executive committee of the  union and two representatives  of the grades concerned on each Board.   The union, however,  declare that  they wish to  appoint  two  members of the executive committee and only one representative of the grades. Both sides have refused to withdraw from their position, but the committee of managers have submitted a proposal for machinery to be set up  on the lines of that  included in the settlements for clerical and supervisory grades. This machinery  provides for a committee of departmental officials of the company con- cerned, and for the man or men in question, to appear before this  committee with a trade union  advocate.   It has been stated  on  behalf of the union that their general experience is very much against this kind of machinery, and that in no circumstances will they agree to its extension.    Boot and Shoe  Operatives  (National). The result of the voting amongst members of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operativesf is as follows : 7,421 in favour of the present system of allowing both piece-work and day-work methods, regulated by quantity statements, to continue under the agreement with the employers,  with no limit of output or wages, and 8,295 against;  10,917  in favour of a day system of working with quantity statements with a limit of output and wages, and 2,965 against.    Irish Postal  Workers&apos; Union. There is some evidence that this union, formerly known as the  Association of Irish Postal Clerks, have recently decided to admit to membership Irish Post Office  workers of all grades except supervisors.  This may bring the union into conflict with the Union of Post  Office Workers, in which many Irish postal workers are at present organised. Ex-Service Men.    Ulster  Ex-Service Metis  Association. The  annual meeting  was held on the 17th December in Belfast.  It was stated that the membership of the association now exceeds4,000,  and that  several new branches have been formed during  the year.  Mr.  RobertBoyd, the organising secretary, presented the annual report, which was adopted, and officers were elected for the forthcoming year.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.    Coopers in the Scottish Fish Curing Trade. The existing agreement between, the coopersemployed in this trade and the employers terminated on the 20th December.  negotiations have taken place for the renewal of the agreement, the workers demanding certain specifiedalterations, and the employers giving notice of a reduction in the piece-rates.  A largenumber of workpeople are out of employment in the industry.Strikes and Lock-Outs.    Railway Shopmen (Great Northern Railway Co.). The strike of fitters, members of theAmalgamated Engineering Union, which began on the 13th December at Doncaster,* andhas since spread to other centres,  still continues.  It has now been sanctioned by theexecutive of the union, and support has been requested from the National Union of Railway-men and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.Settlements and Agreements.    Coal Miners (South Wales).-A dispute arose in the Rhondda Valley in consequenceof the discharge of 11 colliers at the Park Pit, Cwmparc.  The Ocean Coal Co. stated that thereason for  their dismissal  was that the men&apos;s places had become unworkable, but themen&apos;s contention appears to be that they were dismissed  because they failed to increase output.   Negotiations for  the reinstatement of these  men failed, and a general strike ofthe Rhondda coalfield, affecting 45,000 workpeople, was declared on the evening of the 21stDecember.   The intervention of the South  Wales Miners&apos; Federation led, however, to atemporary settlement, the men agreeing to  resume work on the 28th December, pendingnegotiations between the Federation and the owners.    Shipbuilders and Engineers (National). A meeting of representatives of the Federationof Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades and the Engineering and the National Employers&apos;Federations was held on the 16th December, to  consider the  men&apos;s claim, for an increaseof Qd. per hour.  After some discussion, it was agreed to adjourn the matter for six months ;and a proposal was put forward for a joint committee to consider in the meantime the adjustment of wages on the basis of fluctuations in trade.    Tinplate Operatives (South  Wales). On the 13th December a meeting was held atSwansea of the workmen&apos;s side of the Industrial Council for  the Tinplate Trade,  anddelegates representing the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the  dockers&apos; union,  tinand sheet millmen, general workers, and  the Amalgamated  Engineering Union werepresent.  In order to  avoid a reduction of  the present weekly bonus, it was  decided to.adopt a sliding scale system of payment, based on the price  of steel bars, and the schemewas referred back to the branches for their  final consideration.   This  scale is intended tocover all process men, as well as engine men and boiler firemen, but the non-process men willnot be included.    Theatrical  Employees  (London). Representatives  of the  National  Association ofTheatrical Employees withdrew from the meeting of the  Conciliation Board on the 17thDecember,  and 4,500 ballot papers were issued on the 18th to members employed at over40 West End theatres, members being asked to vote on (1) acceptance of the ConciliationBoard terms as submitted, or (2) a strike  to  enforce the demand for a wage of 5s.  foreach performance  for part-time  employees, and to obtain the renewal of an agreement under which the managers  recommended all new employees to consider the advisability of joining  the association.  Meanwhile,  West End theatre managers held a special meetingon. the same day, and passed the following resolutions : (1) that no manager will negotiateindependently with the union, and that each manager will  abide by  the decision of theSociety  of West End Theatre Managers ; (2) that in the event of a strike being declared nomanager will pay more than the rates current at the present time under the Willis award and the agreement of January, 1920 ; (3) that in the event of  the ballot being in favourof a withdrawal of labour,  each employee  shall be individually offered employment onthe terms of the Conciliation Board recommendations, and that those who do not accept such  terms shall  be replaced.   On the 21st December,  however, the secretary  of  theNational Industrial  Council for the  Entertainments  Industry wrote to the  national association of Theatrical  Employees suggesting arbitration; the secretary  of the unionagreed to recommend this proposal to his  members, providing that  the other side also accepted.   The managers, however, refused the offer of  arbitration.
Negotiations and  Disputes-continued.    At  a  mass meeting of members of the union on the 24th December it was decidedto accept the recommendations of the Conciliation Board, provided that a settlement was arrived  at concerning the wage demand  of the part-time employees, and the employmentof non-union labour,  not later than the first week of February.    Commercial Road Transport Workers  (South-West England). On the 10th Decemberthe majority of commercial road transport workers on strike at Bristol resumed work atincreased rates of pay, with a  guaranteed minimum weekly wage, ranging from 736&apos;. (id.in the case of one-horse carters, to 85s. in the case of mechanical transport drivers.    The men agreed  to stabilisation of wages for six months, on the understanding that aspecial committee should he formed to draw up a new agreement to be put in operation at-the end of that period.    Two outstanding matters left for the favourable consideration of the cart owners&apos;association were a guaranteed minimum rate of 74s. Qd.t and a grant or present to the menin lieu of retrospective payment.    Owing  to the opposition  of the Motor Transport Employers&apos;  Federation and the bristol  and  District Road Transport Contractors&apos; Association to these generally acceptedterms, the men who  were in the employment of  these associations did not resume workuntil the  20th December.

QUARRYING.    Quarrying.-The Yorkshire Area Joint Industrial Council for the Freestone QuarryingIndustry met on the 21st December. An offer of mediation by a conciliation committeeappointed by the National Council was  declined, on the  ground that the rejection of the employees&apos; application in September for an advance of 4d.  per hour, and for an annualfortnights holiday with pay, did not yet constitute a dispute, that the matter was one tobe dealt with, at the present stage, by the Freestone Section alone, and that  the pendingappeal to the Freestone Sectional Council, which is to be properly constituted at an earlydate, will probably settle the matter.  The failure of the hasty attempt to call togethersuch a body  was  discussed and explained. A proposal to alter the name of the YorkshireArea Council to meet the objection of certain districts in Yorkshire which refused to joinit, was discussed,  but it was decided to continue the present name.  The application by theemployers for a reduction of 4d!. per hour for skilled workers, and 25 per cent, for labourers,and for an increase of  working hours to 49J in the summer months, those in the winter months to be a matter for arrangement,  was decided to be premature, and was withdrawnby the employers in loyalty to the understanding, reached at Huddersfield in June, that wages  shall  be reviewed every four months.  It will be brought forward again at themeeting next February.    The  Sectional National  Council for  the Limestone Quarrying Industry  met on the20th December.  This  was the first meeting  held for eighteen months.  It was decidedto grant a week&apos;s annual holiday with pay to workers who had attended regularly for twelvemonths and  averaged, in the case of time-workers, 46 hours  per week, and, in the case ofpiece-workers, 43 hours per week.                               FOOD AND DRINK.    Scottish Balms. Strike notices were not lodged in Edinburgh on the 18th Decemberas threatened, the master bakers having offered  an advance of 7,9. Qd. per week. Thereis also  a  strong possibility of settlement on the same basis  in Glasgow.  In  Dundee themen appear to be  willing to settle for 5s.  per week,  and in Aberdeen on a basis of 7s. Qd.or thereabouts.   A more hopeful atmosphere exists generally.    Fishing  Industry (Grimsby). A meeting on the 21st  December,  arranged by  theChief Conciliation Officer, proved  abortive, neither a settlement nor the  consent of theparties to arbitration being obtained. The union declined to depart from their attitude,and insisted  on a Court of Inquiry, and, failing this, threatened to hand in notices on the23rd December.  The department urged a postponement  of the threatened strike, pending further consideration of the situation.  Union representatives  were to visit headquarterson the 24th December, and strike notices were suspended until their return.                                  TEXTILES.    Scottish  Hosiery. The position in Dumfries, where about  1,000 operatives belongingto the Workers&apos; Union refused to resume work at reduced rates,  seems to have been clearedby an official ruling as  to the claim of the workers to unemployment benefit.  The rulingstated  that the dispute was regarded as a trade dispute within  the meaning of the Unem-ployment Insurance Act, and that, in all  cases where the workpeople might have continued
 at work at the reduced rate, claims to unemployment benefit would be disallowed ;  and that it was necessary to obtain accurate information as to the workpeople who would have been discharged in any case, on account of slackness of trade, whether they accepted the reduction  or not.   At a  mass meeting of the union on the 18th December, it was agreed that the workers should present themselves for re-engagement pending  negotiations with the employers&apos; association.   About twenty workers were re-employed.     All the manufacturers in the Dumfries district have informed their workers that on account of acute depression in trade,  they cannot continue business.  The position thus resolves itself into a closing down of the factories for an unspecified period.     The liaison officer to the Council attended the annual general meeting of the employers&apos; association on the 22nd December.  After a long discussion on the action of  the associa- tion in reducing wages  without  reference to the- Joint Industrial Council,  and on the relationship of the association to  the Council, it was agreed that a special meeting of the association should be convened in order to consider the whole position.     Wool  Textile Trade  (Wales). The District Council on the 16th December conceded a  sliding scale advance,  and  arrangements have been made for the whole situation to be reviewed at a further meeting in January.     Woollen Trade  (West Wales). The  question in dispute at the Cwerchyr Mill*  was settled by the District Council on the 16th December,  by an &quot;agreement that the man over whom the dispute arose should terminate his employment at the mill.               PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND  PUBLIC  UTILITY SERVICES.     Electricity Supply. The National Joint Board of Employers and Staff Members met on the 18th December.   Consideration of the report of a sub-committee dealing with the scale of bonus applicable to the salaries of the commercial and clerical staffs  of electricity supply undertakings was postponed until the next  meeting.  There was  a long hut incon- clusive discussion of the position of the  Board as  affected  by the measures  taken in the East Midland District in connection with the threatened strike of the technical staffs.     A conference of representatives of the Hackney Borough Council, the Hornsey Town Council, the Finchley and Ilford Urban District Councils, and the Electrical  Power Engi- neers&apos; Association,  was held, under the  chairmanship of Sir David  Shackleton, at the Ministry of Labour on the 20th December to consider the difference in regard to the demands made by the Association.  The Councils were not at the time disposed to discuss the schedule of salaries  and conditions in detail, but offered arbitration before an independent tribunal. The Association could not accept this proposal.   After further discussion the Association^ representatives passed a resolution to  the effect that they were prepared to recommend their executive council to suspend any action with respect to  the four undertakings till the 30th December,  to enable the Councils to agree to adopt the schedule, subject to any reference of any anomalies and difficulties of interpretation to the District  Joint Board which is to be set up for the Greater London area.     Local  Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services,  Manual Workers (England and  Wales).  The District Council for the West Midlands area,  comprising Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire,  met on  the 21st December.   Several applications from local authorities for change of grade were  determined.  An offer of 8 days&apos; holiday per annum with pay was rejected by the trade union side, who claimed the full 12 days recommended by the National Council.  No decision was arrived at.     Waterworks Undertakings. The National Joint Industrial  Council met  on  the 22nd December.   It was agreed that the  question as to whether the  Council should  affiliate with the proposed association of  similar  bodies be held over.   Two members from each side of the Council were appointed to act as arbitrators on a question referred to the Council by the Eastern Counties District  Council, relating to the grading of undertakings in  the area, and the fixing  of minimum rates of pay.   An  executive committee was appointed,  with instructions to act in cases of emergency.  Matters referred to  the National Council by certain District Councils were  determined.     The District Council  for the South Midland area, comprising Gloucestershire, Oxford-shire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Hampshire, met on the 20th December. A claim for a flat increase of 7s. 6d. per week to all employees of undertakings in the area was  rejected by the  employers&apos; representatives.   It was agreed that the  Zoneing and rating Committee should expedite the work of fixing appropriate minimum  rates of payin  connection with the grading of  undertakings in the area.
                      GENERAL   DEPARTMENT.                               TRADE BOARDS.            FIXING AND VARIATION  OF MINIMUM RATES  OF WAGES.

The minimum rates which it is proposed to cancel are those set out in the schedule to the Notices       dated the 25th March and the 1st October, 1920, in so far as they apply to male workers undergoing       a course of training under an Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme or another scheme approved by the       Training Department, and to male and female workers in retail establishments employed in retailing       leather footwear or in receiving, delivering, marking in or marking out such goods for repair.          The general minimum time-rates proposed are 2s. 2d. per hour for male workers, employed on       surgical work, other than indentured apprentices, and 2s. per hour for female workers employed on       surgical work.  Overtime rates calculated on these minimum rates in the manner shown in the       schedule to the Notice dated the 25th March, are also proposed.  The general minimum piece-rates       proposed are additional to those set forth in the schedule to the Notice dated the 1st October.    Shirtmahing Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal,dated the 21st December, to vary the general minimum time-rates for male workers,  and                             MISCELLANEOUS  TRADES.     Co-operative Societies (West Cumberland). The Chief Conciliation Officer has reportedthreatened strikes of the employees of the co-operative societies in West Cumberland. TheCumberland District became parties to an agreement between the Amalgamated Union ofCo-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers and the co-operative societiesin the Northern area, but certain individual societies ignored the agreement and decidedto pay an advance of 7.s. instead of the 10.s. agreed upon.   The union  handed in notices,to expire on the 14th December.   The Chief Conciliation Officer intervened, and the noticeswere postponed.   It is expected that the societies will now act in a constitutional manner,and that the possibility of immediate strikes will be removed.     Cooperative Employees (Southern District.) A deputation  of officials of the Amalga-matcd Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers were received on the 21st December, to discuss the position with regard to a  claim made by that  unionagainst the Southern District of the Co-operative  Union, Ltd. Negotiations have been proceeding between the  parties, but a deadlock has been reached.  The employers offered the Grocery and Provisions Trade Board rates, plus l\d. per cent., but this was not acceptedby the union, AVIIO offered arbitration, which the employers refused.  About 10,000 em-ployees in 100 branches are affected by  the claim.  The Chief Conciliation Officer  is en-endeavouring to bring about a settlement.     Glass. The  chairman  of  the Joint Industrial Council has been informed by  theHome Office  that it is the intention of the home Secretary to  issue a special  Orderexempting the glass industry until the 1st July, 1922, from  the provisions of the Women,Young Persons and Children (Employment) Act.     Domestic Staff (Royal Waterloo Hospital). On the 25th November the Chief ConciliationOfficer, London, received a  letter from the Dock, Wharf, Riverside  and General Workers&apos;Union concerning the wages paid to the domestic staff  and attendants in  the Londonhospitals with special reference to the Royal Waterloo Hospital, where, it was alleged, theprovisions of Industrial Court Award No. 371 were not being observed.   The Chief Concilia--tion Officer has investigated the case, and has ascertained that the domestic servants ofthe  hospital  have not been paid in accordance  with the Award.  The  secretary of thehospital  undertook to communicate with the secretary of  the Regional  Committee for london, which has been set up to deal with these matters, and a further communication willbe sent to the department.

  Employment  and Insurance Department-continued.  Metis Employment.      General Outlook. The reports from the Divisional Controllers indicate a continuation  of the decline in industry.   Employers in most industries are further restricting employ-  ment by closing down for &quot;extended periods at Christmas.      Shipbuilding and Other Industries. The outlook on the Clyde is not regarded as promis-  ing in consequence of the cancellation  of a large number of shipbuilding  and engineering  contracts.  In the Motherwell district  unemployment is becoming more pronounced.  The  Northern Division report that the position on  the Tyne is slightly worse, owing  to the  joiners&apos; strike and to the fact that, in anticipation of a reduction in the price of steel, ship-  owners are inclined to suspend or slow  down work on existing contracts.      At Hartlepool the intermittent delivery of material has practically rendered the ship-  building industry a  casual one so far as the workers are concerned.  There is also  a pro- nounced slackness in the yards on the Wear and Tees. On the Mersey the position is regarded as more favourable,  but it is  stated that the high cost of production is holding back  orders for  ship-repairing and re-conditioning  work.  Ship-repair work at Bute Docks, Newport and Swansea has improved slightly, but at Barry there is no change in the situation.     Restricted working hours are still the pronounced feature of the cotton, woollen, lace, hosiery and boot and shoe trades.   There is apparently little prospect at present of an early revival of trade  in these industries, except that reports from Leicester and Nottingham indicate some possibility of a  revival in the lace and hosiery trades early in the New Year.     Yeovil report that the demand for  flax has resulted in the workpeople employed in the- Bunford flax  factory, and other factories in the neighbourhood, being placed on full time. A more hopeful view is taken in the Sheffield district of the position in regard to the engineer- ing and steel trades,  which have been depressed owing to a shortage  of orders.     Industrial Developments. Woolwich report that  firms in  the district employed  on cable making are expected to increase  their establishment in the New Year by dispensing with overtime, which, it is hoped, will result in the employment of some 200 to 300 additional men.     The Powell Diiffryn Steam Coal Co., Ltd., will commence operations during the next few  days on a new engineering works which is to be erected between Nelson and Treharris, and at Cheltenham a pin factory,  giving employment to 500 girls, 50 men, and a few boys, is on the  point of being opened.     Labour Reductions. At  Willenhall, Messrs. Vaughan Bros., drop forgers, have sus- pended all their workpeople indefinitely owing to lack of orders.   Swansea report that two fuel works have closed down owing to a shortage of orders with the result that approximately 800 men are thrown out of employment.  At Barrhead some 40 men will be affected by the closing down of the works of the National Tar Products Co., Ltd.     Messrs. Gwynnes, Ltd., Chiswick, have discharged  250 workpeople owing to slackness in the motor trade, and a further discharge of 100 men is expected during the week.     Shortage of Material. In addition to the difficulty at Hartlepool referred to above, Glasgow report that  the Woodside Engineering Co., Ltd., possible Park, have  discharged about 60 men owing to a shortage of raw material. At Lewisham the housing scheme  is progressing very slowly owing to a shortage of cement. Wometis  Employment.     General Situation. The unemployment situation continues to develop and a further increase of over 11,000 has taken place in the women&apos;s live register.   There is little change in the register of the  London Division,  which stood at  34,500 on the 26th November and at 36,500  on the 10th December.   During the same period the  register of the  South Midlands  Division has risen  from 5,000 to  7,400;  that of the West Midlands Division from 16,000 to 19,000; that of the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division from 15,300 to 18,000, and that of Scotland from 7,500 to 9,500.  In the North-Western Division the rise,  from 14,600 to 27,000, sharply illustrates the severe depression in the textile industry, and in Ireland a rise from 2,000 to  6,000 is due to the severe depression in the linen industry of the North and to dislocated trade conditions caused by civil commotion.    Local Reports. The North-Western Division state that the situation in the cottonindustry is becoming worse.   All Exchanges in textile areas refer to the enormous numberof claims   to unemployment insurance benefit which  have been received daily.  It  isexpected that extended Christmas holidays will be  taken throughout  the cotton industry.Other  industries  throughout the  division  remain  depressed, namely, corset  making  at
151.1.21,Altrineham ;  the fancy leather trade at  Ashton,  Rochdale and Stockport;  batting atAshton, Den ton and Stockton;  box-making at Ashton ;   confectionery  at  Aston andNelson;  slipper-making  at Bacup and Bury;  jute at Barrow ;  the sewing trades  atBlackpool, Manchester, Levenhulme,  Salford,  Crewe, Openshaw and Eochdale;  paper-making at Bury ;  cardboard box making at Liverpool and Warrington ;  bag and sack-making and mending, and  tinned goods  labelling at Liverpool;  the dye industry andjam-making at Nelson;  rubber manufacture at Openshaw and Rochdale, and asbestosmanufacture at Widnes.    Increasing depression, short time and extended Christmas holidays are reported by the yorkshire and East Midlands Division in the woollen and cotton textile industries.   IJerbyreport large numbers of workers suspended during the week  in the hosiery and lace trades.At Dewsbury the position of the rag sorters is said  to be particularly  bad;  there is no improvement in. blouse manufacturing, and only sweet  manufacturers  are working fulltime.   At Hebden Bridge it is stated that all firms of any size in  the area have placedtheir workers on short time.  At Ilkeston the largest hosiery manufacturers are workingsystematic short time, and the lace, needle, wire and leather  manufacturers are discharging their employees for an indefinite  period.   Approximately  1,000 people are signing theunemployment  insurance register.  Morley report 2,000 live unemployment insuranceclaims  owing to the depression  in the  textile trade, and the  live register is nearly  doubledfor the same reason at Liverseclge.   There is unemployment in the textile and leatherindustries at Stanningley, and slackness in the  hosiery trade is increasing at Sutton-in-Ashflelcl.  In Todmorden the depression in the cotton trade  is daily becoming more acute ;1,700 short-time workers  are claiming unemployment insurance benefit.    The South Midlands and Eastern Division report large increases in the live registers atLeicester, Norwich and  Kettering.  At Leicester 2,000 unemployment  insurance claims were made during the week and a further 2,000 were  expected before Christmas.   Hosieryand boot firms  throughout  the town  are  seriously affected.  At Norwich  there is severedepression in the boot, clothing and  silk  industries, and at Wellingborough in the bootindustry.  The  depression in this trade continues marked in Northampton and extendedChristmas holidays will be general.    Reports from  the West Midlands Division  continue to show severe depression andslackness in the motor and cycle trades and in the silk, leather, rubber and clothing trades.At Sparkhill, motor and cycle works are very slack.   At Coventry,  27 firms are on short time, and the live register is now 2,300.   Cotton workers and clothing machinists are on short time at Newcastle-under-Lyme.  The pottery  trade is  still reported to  be  good  atBurslem, Hanley and Longton.    The severe unemployment in  London shows no  abatement.  At Bermondsey,  wherejam-makers, tin box makers, leather stitchers, tailoresses and general factory workers are affected, the register now stands  at  1,882 ; at the  Borough Exchange it is 1,416.  AtDeptford it is over 2,000, and the  matter  has been considered by a special meeting of theLocal Employment Committee. Other Exchanges with registers over 1,000 are Stepney,Tottenham, Hackney, Woolwich, Leyton, Kings Cross, Camberwell, Shoreditch, Stratfordand Shepherds Bush.    In the  South-Western Division,  the  wholesale  clothing, boot, collar,  corset  making and chocolate making industries are reported slack.    Short time continues to be reported from Scotland in most industries, notably in jute,hosiery, woollen textiles, linen manufacture, calico printing,  clothing and rubber.   Hosieryand clothing workers have been dismissed or are on short time at Dumfries.   Unemploy-ment is increasing in the textile industries at G-alashiels and Kilmarnock.                       LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.    Unemployment -The committees  continue in close touch with local authorities, andare keeping themselves informed of all  developments  in  public works.  Resolutions havebeen received recently from the Acton, Tooting and Taunton Committees calling attentionto the  need for re-opening trade relations with Russia.  The Bermondsey  Committee call upon the Government to take action to remedy the adverse rates of exchange.  The largenumber of painters at present  out of work  is the reason for a recommendation from the st. Albans and Reading Committees that Government and public authorities should be urged to put  in hand their usual redecorating work at once.    Ex-Service  Men. Further  committees have  expressed  the opinion  that   disabledmen  who are Unemployable, by reason not only  of their disability but also of  the present
industrial conditions, should be maintained by the State, and withdrawn from the labour market altogether.  The Middlesbrough Committee recently discussed this question very fully and came to the conclusion that the solution of the placing of the severely disabledman lies  in the direction of granting Local Employment Committees wide discretionarypowers to determine whether a  man&apos;s capacity justifies placing him on a higher rate ofpension.  In  connection  with work on  the  forthcoming census some committees arerecommending that special  preference should be shown to disabled and other ex-Servicemen.      OUT-OF-WORK  DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.    Out-of-Work Donation.-^-Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and  Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 16th December,show 256,431 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  236,630  8s. 4ci    Unemployment  Insurance. The number of payments of  unemployment insurance benefit, during the week  ending  the 10th December, was 147,295, involving an amountof  90,077 9s. 5d.            DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.    Up to the 21st December, 23,348 certificates have been issued to employers  underthe scheme.  The undertakings given by these employers cover 256,539 disabled ex-Servicemen.    The Divisional Controller  for the West Midlands reports that  the continued industrialdepression renders  the problem of absorbing disabled men into employment a matter ofincreasing difficulty.   It is,  however, a gratifying fact that, when dispensing with labour,employers are retaining disabled men &quot;whenever possible.    The preference given in the allocation of Government contracts to firms on the King&apos;sRoll has been  of considerable  value in bringing into the scheme a large number of firms who had hitherto ignored the appeals made on behalf of disabled men.  The Government^example in this direction is  being followed by a number of local authorities.    At Smethwick the number of disabled men placed in employment increased from 5 inthe previous month to 29 during the present month.  The Mayor, being present when out-of-work donation was being paid, was so impressed with the number of unemployed disabledmen in the town that he assured the manager that there would be closer co-operation infuture between the local  authority and the Ministry, and a number of men  have beenplaced at work in the  parks.                               JUVENILE  BRANCH.Juvenile Employment  Committees.    Hosiery Embroidery for Girls. The  Worksop Juvenile  Advisory  Committee   have appointed a special sub-committee to inquire into the work performed by girls in the hosieryembroidering industry in other areas, and the possibility of developing the  industry  in thetown.  It was ascertained that four girls are  now engaged on this work locally, but that many more could be employed if sufficient orders were obtained, as the work can be done at home as soon as training  is complete.   The committee have therefore decided to ask thelocal hosiery manufacturers  to place their orders for this class of work in the town insteadof other districts.    Apprenticeship : Building. A conference has recently been held between representativesof the Barnstaple  Juvenile  Advisory Committee  and of the employers&apos; and  operatives&apos;associations, to consider the question of apprenticeship in the building trades.  A scheme has now been drawn up and approved by the committee, but some revision will probablybe necessary before it is submitted to the trade as a whole.  It has been suggested  that arepresentative of the Joint Industrial Council should be invited to meet the committee.    At the last meeting of the London Building Trades Apprenticeship Committee attention was drawn to the large number of boys on the waiting list.  The opinion was expressed thatthe larger builders are taking their full quota of apprentices, but that the smaller firms have as yet taken little or no  action.  With a view to increasing the number of vacanciesfor apprentices it was recommended that an advertisement drawing attention to the facilities offered by the committee should be inserted regularly in The Builder for the next six months,and that during this period an officer should he specially detailed to canvass builders in theLondon area.  A deputation  was also appointed  to interview the council of the Londonmaster builders and to enlist  their support.

There  were  16,186 men awaiting training, the  corre-    Unemployment Centre (Liverpool). To deal with the serious effects of the increasing unemployment among juveniles at Liverpool the education authority opened, on the 1stDecember, a centre for unemployed boys, with educational and recreational facilities.  Thecentre is similar to those established during the period of out-of-work donation, and works in close co-operation both with the Juvenile Exchange and the education  authority&apos;sbureau.   The centre is open for five days a week, both in the morning and the afternoon, butthe difficulty is to secure regular attendance without any such financial inducement as was offered by  the  out-of-work donation.  The Divisional Controller reports that there isalready a marked improvement in the appearance and behaviour of the boys attending thecentre.  Twenty-two out of 100 attending in the course of three weeks have been placed inemployment.

                                APPENDIX.                          QUESTIONS  IN  PARLIAMENT.    The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House ofCommons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Unemployment.    Commander Bellairs asked the Minister of Labour the numbers of unemployed in thethree or four trades which contribute most to the total of 550,000 unemployed accordingto the  latest figures available.    Dr. Macnamara:  The trades 03  occupations in which the largest number of men were registered at Employment Exchanges on the 10th December were : Engineering andiron-founding, 88,000 (of whom 21,000 were labourers);  general labourers, 81,000; transporttrades, 52,000; building and works of construction, 42,000 (of whom 16,000  were  paintersand 22,500 were labourers).   The largest numbers of registrations among women were: in domestic service,  26,000;  textile trades, 24,000;  clothing trades, 22,000.  In addition,there were on the  10th December, 88,042 persons on short time drawing out-of-work dona-tion  or unemployment  insurance benefit.  Of these, 50,474  were in the cotton trade ;15,325  in other textile trades ; 8,555 in the clothing and boot and shoe trades ; and 4,510in engineering and ironf ounding.    Commander Bellairs:  With regard to the number of painters and labourers who areunemployed totalling some 38,000-is it not the case that all  of those men would be em-ployed, and more, if the number of bricklayers were increased, and is it not the case that alarge number of men  in the finishing trades also would be employed if there were  morebricklayers.    Dr. Macnamara :  Speaking generally, there are 42,000 men out, but 22,500 of these arelabourers, and those would be absorbed if we could get more bricklayers.   Not only all thelabourers, but also the  16,000 painters and the others who come in at  the close of theoperations connected  with  housing would be absorbed if  there were moife bricklayers. (23rd December.)  sponding totals for the 14th December and the 23rd November being 16,041 and 16,944,  respectively.  The number of men whose training had been completed since the  1st  August, 1919, was 22,732, the totals for the 14th December and the 23rd November being  22,307 and 20,979, respectively.      Partly owing to the prevailing conditions in industry, and partly to the near approach  of Christmas, the statistics for the week  are somewhat unsatisfactory.  There has been  some decrease in the number of men in training, and the waiting list allows a slight increase.  In nine divisions there has been a falling off in the number of men under instruction, ranging  from 61 in London to 1 in Devon and Cornwall, while the highest increase is 29 only, in the  South-Eastern  Division.  Increases in the waiting lists are shown by 9 out of the 16  divisions, amounting to more than double  the reductions made in the  remainder.  Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.      Applications. There  has  been  further  progress  in  providing  for  &quot; unmated&quot;  apprentices. The number  is being gradually diminished in the South-Eastern area,&apos;  where local headquarters have been successful in providing for certain apprentices in districts  other than those in which they live.   Vigorous action  has also been taken elsewhere.  In  the Northern area two other firms, in addition to the Darlington Porge  Co., Ltd., have  agreed to accept apprentices formally with a view to their receiving institutional training,  and to employ them subsequently for their remaining periods of renewed apprenticeship.      Plumbers  (Scotland). A marked improvement in  the  position is reported  in  the  plumbing  trade  at Edinburgh.  A further  joint conference has  been  held.  There was  again  opposition at first,  but eventually the outstanding cases were satisfactorily settled,  with a few exceptions, notably two in which special difficulty was presented by the health  of the apprentices, and one or two where the employers complain  of the apprentices&apos; lack  of ability.   These are all to be further investigated by the operatives.      [Reference  to matters of interest  to the Appointments and Training Departments  will  also be found on pages 6,12, 16 and 17.]
