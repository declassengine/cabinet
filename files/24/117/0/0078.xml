DRAFT LETTER TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES.                          BY                 THE MipiggER OP HEALTHt          (Reference &apos;0*P.o23C3 and C.P.2364).     In view of the widespread depression of trade which prevailsat the present time, the Government are anxious that the existing^volume of work should be shared &apos;.as far as posilble among thewhole body of thowsge-earning classes.     In some industries the practice of working &amp;ort time withthe object of pioriding employment for a larger number of people is well-established; in others the nature of the industry maymake any such arrangement difficult; but the Government feel that much can bo done to alleviate distress by distributing the &apos;existing opportunities for employment among as many as possibletBO that the largest numbers may be enabled to earn a portionof their usual wages.     A system of short time may enable the work to be spread fora longer time over the existing number of those employed andalso to give employment to some who are now unemployed and maybe suitable for the work.     The distresses of those who are unfortunately unemployed  .affect local authorities In an acute degree.  It is on this account that many local authorities have lately begun operations on various works of public utility and are preparing to de BOvith respect to many more.  In pressing forward these enterprisesthe Government would urge upon local authorities the desirabilityof considering at once what re-arrangements can be made to givepartial employment to the maximum number of people.  It willprobably be found In many cases that the (-uestion can best toapproached in consultation with the Trades Union concerned, on whose
oo-ape ration the Go Term ont feel confident they can rely.      It is hflped that no time will be lost in taking thenecessary steps.   The Government have already planned to do  all that -Gcvernmcnt can do to provide in various ways for those who are out of work, hut thoy loo^: to local authorities as well as to other employers and their workpeople to do what they can to keep the number of wholly unemployed as lowas possible                                C.addison.Ministry of Health,   29th Deoember ,1920.
