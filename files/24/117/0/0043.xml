P.   234 3 --------  .^S^telegram from High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, to Secretary of State, HALLG^S^         &apos;        &apos;    dated 20th December 1920.  So)4&amp;     104 S.  Private.  Your private telegram of 17th instant.  My telegram of 8th.December was  sent after conference  with  Chief of  the  General Staff on behalf ofGeneral Commanding-in-Chief, and draft  was accepted  by him before despatch.Simultaneously with  your present telegram to me,  telegram  has reached  GeneralCommanding-in-Chief from  the War  Office making same suggestion  in more livelyform.  Secretary  of State for War even  seems to think  that proposal can begin totake shape  at  once.   General  Officer Commanding  and  I  are of opinion  that,whereas withdrawal to line indicated might be possible two years hence, propositionis not a practical one for the present purpose.     In my judgment, if we  retired to the  line  indicated,  we should be quite unableto fulfil terms of  mandate  either  in respect of our obligation to League of  nations or to the  people  of  this  country.   It  would  mean leaving  infantile  national government with a grave menace looming from the  north  entirely  without  meansof protecting their frontiers or maintaining internal order.  In existing circumstances it would involve  withdrawal of all Indian  labour and the consequent abandonment of railways,  and closing  down of  present  technical  organisations.   It would alsoentail simultaneous withdrawal of practically  whole of British  personnel north  of line, as I can hardly imagine any  would  consent to remain  if such be the policy ofHis Majesty:s Government.     If we are  to accept mandate, I can suggest  no alternative  scheme winch itwould be  possible to  put into operation  until peace  with Turkey has been  ratifiedand  Kemalists  and Bolsheviks have  ceased to be a menace.   Such a satisfactorysituation  can  hardly  be expected at  all  events  before  next  autumn.  When itdoes come, it seems to me, as a layman, that some reduction might  be possible  onthe two divisions by concentrating our main force  in  Baghdad and beyond, and merely safeguarding our communications behind us.  Externally it is from the northand internally from Baghdad that  trouble is likely to start,  and, as regards  Basrahor the oiFields,  we can always act promptly  from India.     I believe that if the War Office proposal, with all it involves, were accepted  now,we should before  long either have to  withdraw altogether or reconquer country in front of us.  In any case, I would repeat that the intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to submit the mandate to  the League of Nations  in the immediate futureseems to be fundamentally incompatible with the adoption of such a  policy as that suggested.2983    100  12.20.SEORET.
