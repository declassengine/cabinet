House  of Commons,                                                2 2nd. [December, 1920.Bear Prime Minister.          The Labour Party are feeling greatly oonoorned  regardingthe proposals being urged in oortoin quarters to arrest the  dOYSlop-men ts In eduoation provided in the last English and Scottish Acts,and we sincerely hope that the Cabinet&apos; will seriously consider thewbole situation before committing themselves to such a oourse.I think it is perfectly true to state that  the bulk sf&apos; theinoraaso in the cost of education Is  due to increases  in  the salaries of the teachers and the prioes of materials, and that  to  allow theActs to come into full operation will have  little effect  financially.      To punish the rising generation and to stem normal  developments in education because of the effects of the  War would be a bad  policy,      Knowing your broad-minded sympathy I  would beg you  to  put the whole situation before your colleagues  before any definite decision is reached.      It should be borne in mind that War conditions were veryprejudicial to education,*                                 Yours sinoarely,                                       (Sgd.) Wm/Adanson.RUHon.
