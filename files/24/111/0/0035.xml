Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. gSECRET.Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to Secretary of State for India,dated 2nd September .1920.We are evacuating Arbil and Koi during the week.It has been necessary for Assistant Political Officer to leave Suq owing to spread of Jehad, and it will probably be necessary to evacuate Samara shortly. Line to Mosul, which is already cut, is unlikely to be restored in consequence for some months. General Commanding-in-Chief, with my full concurrence, intends, I believe, to evacuate Narsiriyah as soon as he&apos; has extricated detachment at Sama (which will not be for a month), and will concentrate all his forces on the Tigris as we cannot risk having any more detachments, whether large or small, cut off.2231     100  9.20
