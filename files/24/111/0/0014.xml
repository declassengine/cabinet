The Cabinet have do elded -chat the rebels must he quelled effectually, and I shall endeavour to meet all your requirements.    We have arranged to send you the addition-&apos; al nineteen battalions from India,    The third air squadron should shortly be available for action, and I have to-day ordered the fourth air squadron (the 55th) from Constantinople to Basra with all speed.    Thus, by the middle or end of October you should be possessed of effective striking forces, and a vigorous use of these to put down and punish disaffection combined with the policy of setting up an Arab State should bring about a better situation.-I shall be glad to hear from you if you have any further needs/-though of course you know how severely strained our limited resources are.
