Arrival of the first fissitn.In March 1917 in response to urgent appeals, tho British Hallway Mission to Roumania was formed, and arrived at Jassy shortly after the outbreak of the Russian Revolution.   It consisted of the General Manager and Enginesr-in-Ghief flf ono of the leading South American Railwayst the Chief Meohanioal Engineer of one of the most important British Railways together with other experienced railway-men and Roumanian and Russian speaking officers.Owing tc the difficulties of communication between Roumania and Great Britain, material help was difficult to send, and tho Mission eooupied itself in reoommonding im-proveraents in transportation organisation and also in better-ing the relations between the Roumanian and Russian Railway Staffs.   Technical advice was given in all branches and many of the difficulties cf transhipment from the Russian broad gauge to the Roumanian normal lines wore overcome, and the Russians were at the same time urged to increase their imports of railway material, fo^d, munitions and fuel.   Under the guidance of the Mission distinct improvements were made in communications and despite the increasing &amp;iffioiiltios on the Russian side, some system was introduced into transportation generally.In January 1918 it became obvious that Roumania would bs forced to make peace on the best terms possible, Russia had by this time besoms entirely Bolshevik and the Roumanians found themselves in dire straits, cut off from the Allies with rapidly decreasing material and supplies.parture of In March tbe Treaty of Bucharest was signed, and by itse first      terms all foreign Missions were to leave the country at once, saion.       Accordingly the British Railway Mission together with theother Allied Missions left Jassy on March 9th 1918 and returned to England Yla Odessa, Moscow and Archangel.rival of Directly after the Armistice the Roumanian Railwayoond Mission was re-formed with four of the officers who had beenssion.        on the original Mission, and left London along with the Military Mission to Reumanla in December 1918.The Railway situation at that time was exoeedinly bad and there was much suffering throughout the country owing to lack of food and fuel.   The limiting factors were lackNof railway repair material and loocmotivea, and the very un-satisfaotery state of the existing workshops.   In order &quot;to can of       eombat the two first difficulties tho British Military500,000      Mission and the Chief of the Railway Section proceeded^Paris and London and in conjunction with General Maneo oiHhe Supreme Eoonomio Council, mioceeded la obtaining a loan from the British Governmont for  500,000 for tho pure haso of Rail-way Material and also a promise of 100 locomotives from Prance

Buda-Pest on AUGUST 2nd.     This movement of troops and the &quot;general wartime measures necessitated by this ascpoditism at once nullified what little had been done daring the earlier     \ part of the year to repair the ravages of war, and of the German occupation.On their return from Hungary the Koumanians brought with thorn a large number of Hungarian locomotives and quantities of rolling sW, and with the former they commenced to re-organ-ise their train services, again a slight improvement is notice-able, and again a falling off.    Boumanlan engineers and engine drivers seem quite incapable of maintaining er driving these iooos, wi th the result that they have rapidly fallen into the most hopeless state of disrepair, aud the country finds itself once again on the verge of acute transport crisis.forts to bain is.Efforts have been made on all hands by SouniaAAa to obtain loans for the reconstruction of her railroads and the purchase of locomotives, bat with little or no success, some fow arderss have been carried out but on so small a scale as to render them almost negligible.    roumania steadily refuses to give, any concessions or guarantees in exchange for money or locomotives and consequently she is unable to obtain either *    Her aiHwp^gt to repair and reorganise internally aro of little or no avail her worksliops are now being run at a loss, the work turned out being werth less than one third of the cost incurred-     The Hou^anians seem incapable of administering or organising the smallest or simple at programme of repairs, 1st alone the whole of their railway systems.The general opinion at the aoteent seems to Tie&apos;, that unless Boumania is willing to give in, and allow foreign intervontlen. in her country generally and hor railways in particular, she will in the not for distent future bo fa sad with complete financial collapse.    She has not in the country today sufficient leooa in working order to maintain herrestrioted passenger service or her hopelessly inadequate goods traffic Q*he earlier grain crops this year have been excellent, bmt were she to s*op all ether traffic over her lines she could not transport one quarter of what she has actually m hand fer exports
Regarding the work of the Mission since its return in December 1919, nn* can only say that it has been entirely negative.    With the exception of tho graaUWS of the leaa *f  500.000 to the Houmanisa Railways (whiah has since been rerueed to  250,000 in view tf the events in Hungary) the Mission has been able to do little of any real, use er give any useful help, this through ne fault cf its *im but entirely through the mistrusting and at times almost hostile attiuuae of the Roumanian authorities.    For instance, great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining vital statistics regard!^ tho railway and fuel situation, and taehnioal advioewhen teftda: od as an ally and friend has either Tseen entirely ignored or h&amp;; met with every sort, of excuse imaginable.     On *ne occasion the ^IreotoT-^eneral. cf Railways admitted to the C&amp;icf cf the MiesifK that he had no good mechanical engine era and that his shops were in a staie of chaos;   whilst at another time the earns officer way told by the eama Direet*r-&apos;&amp;eneral that he fc*4 no need cf advice and that ftcumania could run her railways without help Just as she had done during the ferfcy years *  prosperity prfcc^fng &quot;the war.    Such statement and suftlv co*v-traaictions are eultt, in keeping with the general policy ef Roumania and are only on a par with the arrangements and counter -arrangements she haa attempted to make regarding fcer locwaotiTa contracts which have one and all up to the present ended in &quot;smoke&quot;,One firm after another has sent representstires to Bucharest in the hopes cf getting contracts cr concessions but all with the same result, possibly in their failure thera is some consolation, for the officers cf the railway Missitn T^ke for example the case cfwho had actually signed a contract for the supplying cf eighty locomotives and had already some twenty of these loaded *m a ship in England, when the whole contract was repudiated by a new government and in addition the com which was to be given in part payment was found to be non-extant.The present position in Roumania is far from satisfactory no matter from what point of view one regards it, the whole country seems to have fallen into a kisid cf lethargy, the governments which follow each other in rapid succession seem steadily to disimproTe, no real work is done and their time is passed in discussing affairs which happened during the war and in denouncing various deputies who in those days shewed pro-German tendencies.    All public services are bad, hardly a week passes without some form cf strike cr another, post and telegraphs, tramways and the State cigarette and match factories have all had varying periods of from ten&apos;days to four weeks, during the past two mtntha.    Road communication all over the old Kingdom is exceedingly bad, and the attempts -made to-repair have la almost every case rendered natters worse than before, no attempts have Um mdQ u       ^    ^roac or railway,bridges, in no case so far as I am aware has a Broken bridge been repaired with a permanent structure.Railways however are prebably the worst of all, jfrcn every point of view, and it seeirs almost certain that there
will be a complete breakdown in the near future unless some external help can be obtained. Trains are running anything up to 24 hours late, and the condition of the locomotives becomes daily worse. In this respect I may cite the example of the Simplen-Orient Express which brought Marshal Joffra to Bucharest last week, this train was delayed for twelve hours at Temisvar owing to engine failure and there was neither water nor light for a good portion of the run.

With the exception of the maize crop which has more or less failed the other grain crops have been very good, the outlook commercially regarding the hopes of transporting them to the coast is however exceedingly blask, and there is no doubt that the winter will bring much suffering in the larger towns owing to the lack of transport for food and fuel.

Some fear has been expressed in various quarters regarding Bolshevism, but I respectfully submit that these are in the main captaine unfounded, for with the exception ef strikes in the larger towns and a great deal of slackness amongst the industrial population the vast majority ef the people, namely the peasants, are perfectly contented, and are probably happier under the new land laws that they have ever been in the history of the country.

The main trouble in Roumania today seems to be the utter lack of appreciation of the financial position and the inability of the Government to administer or organise in the slightest degree; coupled with these the people generally and the upper classes especially appear to be suffering from the most aggravated form of "swelled-headedness". They appear to imagine that the wealth of Roumania, at present almost entirely unexploited, will be sufficient to pull them out of their difficulties, and with a view to her "great future" the Allies should come forward with loans without guarantees... Everyone seems quite unable to appreciate that if foreigners are allowed to come and trade, and are given concessions in the country that it will be putting money into the pockets of the Roumanians themselves, the policy of "Roumania" for the "Roumanians" seems to have taken very solid root, and will probably take a very long time to eradicate.

So far as one can judge no attempt has been made to formulate a future policy for the re-establishment of communications in this country. with her present ideas on world finance there is no hope whatever of her getting her railways on a satisfactory footing and it seems obvious that there is only practical solution open to her and that is to lease her entire railway system to a foreign firm. Too deep a root has set in for ordinary measures to be of the slightest use and it will now have to be a clean cut to save the situation.
