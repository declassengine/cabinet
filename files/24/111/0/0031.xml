.*h!* DocLVn.l:li!.JiJJie.....Pioperty of       &apos; 392CP. 1183 1] , Xj    THE REMOVAL OP THE BREAD SUBSIDY.MEMORANDUM BY THE CONSUMERS&apos; COUNCIL.1. At a Meeting of the Consumers1 Council held on the-&quot;27th-Juljj^ ^92C the -following resolution was passed:-that this Council having considered the figures laid before thorn by the Wheat Commission on the prospects of the wheat supplies of the, year, note that the present position is that the subsidy on bread shall be progressively reduced; that meanwhile the price of imported wheat will be lowered in view of the favourable harvests, but that the reduction of the    ;! subsidy will cause a continuous rise in the price of bread simultaneously with the reduction in the price of wheat- ,The Council urge that such an increase in price will cause great hardship and discontent, and that the Government should consider favourably the maintenance of the bread subsidy over a longer period in order that the price of bread should not be further increased during the winter months&quot;*2.   On the 11th August the Government announced their decision that    V the Bread Subsidy must go by the end of the present financial year. In view of this decision and as the Council is in recess, a Meeting of the Reforms Sub-Committee was Immediately convened and the following resolution passed:-&quot;That this meeting of the Reforms Sub-Committee of the Consumers1 Council in view of the serious alarm and discontent caused by the decision of the Government to remove the Bread Subsidy and in view of the fact that this Winter the cost of living will be higher than at any period during the control urge upon the Government the desirability of reconsidering their decision, which if adhered to will cause great-suffering and privation to the majority of the community.That the Prime Minister or in his absence the Minister In Charge be asked in view, of the urgency of the matter to receive a deputation from the Council immediately, and that the Chancellor ot the Exchequer&apos;be asked to be present at such interview.  The following members were appointed to state the case for the Council.Mr. HyndmanLord Rathereedan . ^Dr. Marion Phillips Mr.. Poult on.That the Pood Controller be asked to be kind enough to       t introduce the deputation, that all members of the Consumers1 Council be invited to be present and that a copy of this , Resolution be sent to them forthwith.n3.  The decision of the Cabinet to discontinue the Bread Subeidy is a,,, matter of grave concern to the whole Community and more especially to the working classea.  The subsidy has been in operation for more than . three years and has operated in a manner most beneficial to the.working classes.   It has not only enabled them to obtain cheaply the food upon which the bulk of them rely for the maintenance of their families, but it hae tended to keep down the prices of subsidiary foods such as oata, meat etc. which owing to concerted aotion by &quot;traders, rise or fall in sympathy with the price of bread.
MINISTRY OF FOOD. 3rd September 1920.H, S. SYRBTT.Secretary.4,   The unfortunate result of the removal of the subsidy at the present time cannot it exaggerated. It is estimated that, in conse-evience the price ef the 4 la. leaf will rise to at least l/4d, and Visibly to l/6d,   The effect ef this in the ordinary working class household must inevitably be great privation and suffering. Almost every article of food which 18 included in the Statistics of retail prices now costs mere than it did even during the last mont-hd of the War.   The near future does not hold out any prospect of relief. Milk prices will advahce as the Winter^ comes on and the cost of other dairy produce is also bound to increase.   The last Monthly Report issued by the Ministry of Pood shows that prices are still tendlnfc upwards.   Comparing them with those of a month before, all prices f-ose with the exception of potatoes. Except for a brief period Ibetween January and July, 1919, the rise since July, 1914 has been almost continuous1Taking the index number for the price of the principal foods as 100 at the end of July, 1914 prices had more than doubled at the time of the Armistice, In January 1919 the index number had risen te 230, it fell to 209 in the following July, but in the following Jaauftwy had risen to 236, and at the beginning of the present rfionth it was 262,   The following table shows the comparison between the retail prices of food and the prices of other commodities:-Pood    Cereals Rubberm_    &amp; Meat     Textiles  Minerals   Timber etc.July 1914 &quot;TOO       100       &quot;&quot;T3o 100 100H     1920 258       261 416 278 281Ai%. 1920 262       269 42 1 282 2795.    The decision of the Government to raise the price of the loaf is particularly unfortunate inasmuch as it synchronizes with the seasonal increases in the prices of other essettial food stuffs, such as milk, butter, eggs, bacon etc, with the increased cost of travelling, and freight, and with the imposition of higher rents recently decreed by the Government, when the Winter Season with its inevitable expenditure for fuel, warm clothing etc, is approaching. It is thus calculated to aggravate hardships at the season when climatic and industrial conditions are at their worst,6.  The amount of the Subsidy has recently been reduced by some-thing like  45,000,000,  By its total abolition the Cabinet are virtually converting an impost borne by the whole of the community,, into a heavy and inequitable burden to be borne, in the main, by the poorer part of the population since the working classes are the larg. est consumers of bread, which forms the principal food of most work-ing olass households,7.   The increase in the price of bread following upon the removal of the Subsidy will inevitably be followed by demands for increased wages aid this the vicious circle of wages chasing prices will be oontinued. There are large masses of people throughout the country such as Old Age Pensioners and all persons with moderate fixed in-comes or salaries who have had no increase in purchasing resources upon whom the rise in the price of bread will also inflict great hardships *8,   The Council recognise that some steps must be taken to prevent the Bread Subsidy from increasing still further and suggest that the proposal which was put before the Government by the Ministry of Food for reducing the cost of bread by eliminating the inefficient bak-eries should be further examined, A9,   The Council suggest that the removal of the subsidy must inevitably cause discontent, and possibly bread riots among the people. This would scarcely fail to influence very prejudicially the credit of Great Britain already seriously sftaken in countries which furnish the great bulk of our wheat supplies. Thus what may be gainei in nominal financial stability by the withdrawal of the subsidy will be lost, to a much greater extent&apos;, iii another way.
