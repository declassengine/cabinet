Reply from the Prime Minister to letter from Mr. Smillie and Mr. Hodges. (See C.P.1879-A).

Dear Mr. Smillie,

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter in reply to the communication which I sent you this morning.

Although a scheme for the permanent regulation of wages in the coal industry might take a little time to arrange the proposal of the Government involved a plan which could be made immediately operative, and would give to the miners an increased rate of wages in return for an enlarged output, which as you yourself are confident, can be readily obtained.

The plan proposed would meet your "present wage claim,"  and in our belief would give to the miners  great and permanent advantages, whilst contributing to the prosperity of the community as a whole. If, however, you still reject this suggestion, I would remind you that a peaceful method of settling the wage claim is still open to you by a means similar to that which is adopted by the railwaymen and the majority of your colleagues of the Triple Alliance.

Yours faithfully,

(Sgd.) D. LLOYD GEORGE.

Robert smillie , Esq.
