H&apos;8&apos;53    )   1  - &apos;   THE CABINET. .......___-^VvV^-   &apos;       THE INTERNAL SITUATION AND MILITARYPRECAUTIONS.In the absence of the Secretary of State for War, the following memorandum by 65 the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the internal situation and certain military 544 precautions is circulated.B. B. CUBITT.The War Office,Uth September, 1920.Amongst the preparatory measures taken with the approval of the Cabinet to meet the serious situation which may arise should the threatened strike of the miners develop into a general strike, or into wide-spread unemployment followed by disturbances, arrangements have been made to increase the military forces in Great Britain by 14 battalions, 10 of which would come from Ireland and 4 from the Rhine.It is important, however, that the Cabinet should realize the consequences of withdrawing these battalions from Ireland and on this subject the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, has stated that if the troops under his command are thus reduced, it will be impossible to maintain even the present semblance of Government control, and a large portion of the country must be abandoned to. the undisputed possession of the revolutionaries.It is not only the net loss of 10 battalions that has to be faced, but also the possible defection and resignation of a great proportion of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the moral encouragement which will be given to the extremists of the Sinn Fein movement, which will also result in a considerable acquisition to their material forces.The reduced garrison will, under such circumstances, be practically impotent as an instrument for the maintenance of law and order, unless it can be employed for operations of a more military nature, which would only be possible if the Sinn Fein movement were proclaimed as a rebellion.The situation of the troops themselves also deserves consideration. The service on which they are engaged, already most difficult and unwelcome, will become still less tolerable if the garrison is reduced, and there is a danger of approaching the limit beyond which cheerful and willing service is no longer to be obtained.To sum up, the threatened strike, if it materializes, will make a demand on our military resources which we are unable to meet without cancelling our obligations in some other theatre; and this memorandum is submitted in order to lay the military situation clearly before the Cabinet, and to give them time to consider and decide which of our existing commitments is to be abandoned in order to provide the force necessary to cope with the threatening conditions at home.HENRY WILSON,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.ISth September, .1920.(B20/3S6)   100  9/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.  8545wo
