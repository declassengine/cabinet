I have read the Minutes of thi! Cabinet Conference on the price to be paid for Homo grown wheat of this harvest.If tho Wheat Commission confirm Lord Leel&apos;s view that his proposal will cost the Exchequer  2,000,000 less than the continuation in existing circumstances of the rostfiction on price, I am in favour of its adoption.But I am and must be dependent on tho experts for the facts.(i)    Will overseas wheat cost so much more? (ii)    Will there be hoarding on any appreciable seale? (iii)    Will the farmer sow an acre more or loss whatever our decision on this point? I believe that the answers to (ii) and (iii) are in the negative but that the answer to (i) is probably in the affirmative and should deoide the issue.(initialled)   A-C.Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S-$?.1  1 .   9 o   SO.SECRET.
