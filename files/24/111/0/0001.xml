g Ql Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Confidential Letter No. 4711/0/15, from the Political Officer, Mosul, to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 25th June 1920.I forward herewith a report on the Tel Afar rising. I would add to it that the movement does not appear to have had active Turkish support. The &quot; Iraq army &quot; was allowed to buy food in Msibin, but the Government there tried to capture an officer who joined the movement.I have little doubt that the pronouncement regarding Great Britain&apos;s policy of establishing, under the Mandate, an Arab Government in Iraq will be stated by the disaffected here as having been extorted from us by recent events, and will be made the starting point for further demands.(Signed;     L. F. Nalder, Lieut.-Col.,Political Officer.Report on the recent Attack at Tel Afar.1. Ever since the Arab occupation of Dair ez Zor in December last, there has been a good deal of restlessness in the desert. Daham ibn al Hadi, who at that time appeared ready to restore the proceeds of a big Shammar raid in October, immediately began to procrastinate. Raids on our lines of communication began to occur. 500 sheep were looted from Shergat in March, but were subsequently recovered. Ain Dibbs was subject to frequent raids, one party of the Albu Algah killing Major MacDonald. Shergat was again raided, this time apparently by Nijris bin Ga&apos;ud and the Agaidat. The attitude of Humaidi became&quot;very unsatisfactory. These events all pointed to general restlessness.2. On 21st April, the first caravan for some months arrived in Mosul from Dair ez Zor. This appeared to inaugurate a fresh period of sedition in Mosul itself. Frequent meetings were held and anti-Government notices were frequently posted upon the walls at night. Raids on our lines of communication increased, culminating in the destruction of a train near Ain Dibbs on 24th May. From one or two sources it appeared that active propaganda was being carried on among the tribes, who did not, however, appear to be affected. In company with the Assistant Political Officer, Tel Afar, I toured the Tel Afar district at the beginning of May ; practically all the Shaikhs of the district came in to Tel Afar to meet me, and expressed great cordiality and friendship both there and in their own tents where we visited them. Just before Ramadhan a party of Tel Afar Aghas and Shaikhs came into Mosul to compete in some Arab events which had been arranged for them in the military races.3. On 26th May news was received of the arrival at Fadghami of a body of &quot;Iraq&quot; troops with a machine-gun, led by Jamil &quot;Beg,&quot; a Mosulawi,* who wTas getting munitions down the Khabur. Reconnaissances by the Assistant Political Officer, Tel Afar, made it clear that attempts were being made to raise the tribes in the name of Abdulla. Motor cars were seen apparently doing a road and water reconnaissance of the Fadghami-Bidea-Ain al Ghazal road. Rumours were current that the force at Fadghami would shortly make a forward move, and on 30th May I submitted to you and 18th Division a report stating that I believed an attempt, with the aid of the tribes, to oust us from Mosul was imminent.On 2nd June Colonel Alexander, G.S.O. 1, made a L.A.M.B. car recon-naissance as far as Ain al Ghazal, but found nothing unusual. Air reconnaissances also reported nothing suspicious. Colonel Alexander left a Vickers gunner with his gun at Tel Afar as additional protection to the Assistant Political Officer. -I had been considerably exercised in my mind as to the advisability of with-drawing the Assistant Political Officer and British staff from Tel Afar. I decided against it on the following grounds : (a) We could get no indication that the attack would develop for a fewdays.(b) The Tel Afar Gendarme buluk was one of the best we had, and the Tel Afarmound afforded excellent opportunities for defence.* An officer of Arab armies from Syria (Sharif!).

(c) Their removal would have been to abandon the district, and would have sentover the tribes en line to the other side. (Jl) It would have caused a most adverse impression in Mosul, the state of whichwas causing me considerable anxiety.On the morning of 3rd June, I spoke to Major Barlow on the telephone. He reported that Sherifian agents had held a meeting in the town the previous night, calling on the Aghas to hold themselves in readiness for the Sherif, whose forces were concentrating on the road near Awainat; that Jamil Eifendi, the Gandarme Yuzbashi, had left the town, and that the telegraph line had been found cut. He told me he had arranged to go out the coming night to reconnoitre in the direction of Awainat to see if the alleged concentration, of which he had no news, existed in fact.18th Division arranged that &apos;planes or armoured cars should visit Tel Afar every day, and that pigeons should be sent out the next morning to ensure communication if the line was cut again.The outbreak Occurred in Tel Afar early the next morning, 4th June. Some tribesmen rode into the town and Tel Afar rose. The gendarme ofEcer, Lieut. Stuart, was shot by one of his own native officers, Mohamed Ali Eifendi, either when going his rounds or in his bed, and no resistance was made by the gendarmes. The gendarme instructor, Sergeant Walker, the clerk, Mr. Lawlor, and the Vickers gunner held out on the roof of1 the billet with the machine gun for some time until the arrival of the Sherifian troops, when they were killed by a bomb.The Assistant Political Officer, Major Barlow, had, as he intended, gone out on the previous evening, and probably at Bogha had found Sulaiman Agha of the Girgiriya, who had endeavoured to capture him. He got away on foot, but was recaptured the next morning near Tel Afar. As he was being taken into Tel Afar he saw the armoured cars, which had left Mosul early that morning, on the road. He made a dash for them and was shot. The armoured cars were unfortunately ambushed in Tel Afar, none of the crews escaping.4. The fall of Tel Afar was the sign for a general rising of all the tribes in the district. Those originally concerned were various of the Shammar Shaikhs, particularly Aulacl Abdul Aziz, Aulad Shalal and Humaidi, the Girgiriya under Sulaiman Agha, Jahaish, Mitaiwid and Muslat of the Khabur Jubur. More or less sedentary tribes such as Albu Hamad and Albu Beclran were carried away with the tide and contributed their quota to the raiding parties. Of these, a large body crossed the Tigris north of Mosul at Chigin and Wana, and, splitting up into small parties, raided the big Christian villages Tel Kaif, Tel TTskuf, and Akqosh, and some of the Yezicli villages, being joined by some of the Hadidiyin tribe and the Saiyids of the villages. Other parties moved south and heavily attacked our lines of communication. They were severely handled, &quot;and suffered considerable losses. AH wires were cut and all roads from Mosul rendered most unsafe.5. 18th Division decided to send a column outf which left on the evening of the 5th. They proceeded to Humaidat, and after resting there a day, made a night march on Albu Maria, where Jamil Beg was trying to concentrate for a march on Mosul. He was surprised and the enemy fled without resistance, the tribes going north-west or south, Jamil himself, with his officers and soldiers, returning down the Dair ez Zor road with six carts. It is most unfortunate that the armoured cars were not able to pursue,* as, could they have done so, the capture of the instigators of the rebellion would have been certain.The results of the column were, nevertheless, most beneficial. It pricked the Sherifian bubble, and repaired our prestige by showing we had troops and were . prepared to use them.Seditionists here had undoubtedly laid stress on the small size of our garrison and alleged we were short of gun ammunition, &amp;c. I also believe they emphasised the small number of troops sent out on the column, and were the more confounded by the ease with which it put to flight the tribesmen and the &quot; Sherif.&quot; Had the :t Iraq &quot; force reached the vicinity of Mosul, I have no doubt that the outbreak in the town,, which had been promised, would have occurred.It is a matter for congratulation that Kurdistan remained quiet. The Qaimaqam of Jezirah was in communication with the leaders of the movement; an attack was expected at Zakho, and at the time of the outbreak there was a &quot;storm focus &quot;* Owing to shortage of tyres.
forming in Muzuri, but in spite of all the Kurds did not move. I have no doubt that had circumstances compelled us to evacuate any of our outlying garrisons, it would have been immediately taken by the Kurds as confirmation of the Sherifian boasts and promises, and would have led to serious outbreaks right along our northern and eastern frontier.6. It appears that the outbreak was the result of a small number of comparatively young men from this country who accepted service with the Sherifs army in 19.17 and 1918 as an alternative to our prisoner of war camps.With the establishment of a Syrian Government they found that places and posts were for Syrians, and they were left without employment. This fired their &quot; patriotism &quot; and led them to embark on a kind of &quot; Jameson raid &quot; to establish an Arab Govern-ment in Mesopotamia which would provide posts and pay for all. Their patriotism did not hinder them raising the tribes by the fictitious use of the name of Sherif Abdullah and the hope of loot.It is a matter of the keenest vexation to me that we have been unable as vet to unearth the society in Mosul which uses the seal of the &quot; Ahd,&quot; and whose circulars have, as is now known, been freely distributed throughout the Arab and Kurdish districts.7. The losses caused have been considerable. The value of Government and civilian property destroyed or looted is probably over Rs. 300,000. Last year&apos;s revenue from the Tel Afar district was about Rs. 350,000, and at the moment of writing it appears probable that this amount will be lost to the Administration.8. The outbreak has shown once again the fatal results of having Assistant Political Officers in frontier districts unsupported by a military force. A comparatively small force could probably have held Tel Afar easily until relieved, and it is indeed highly unlikely that the tribes would ever have attacked the place had it been held.Small detachments are naturally most undesirable from the military point of view, but I submit, with all deference, that it is useless for us to hold Mosul town itself unless we can also hold and control the districts. This at present can only be ensured by the presence of troops in the districts, whose functions should be not merely to garrison the headquarter town, but to make patrols, and, if necessary, take, strong punitive action in the case of incipient trouble. These functions would normally be performed by levies, but until public opinion in this division is convinced that to serve the Government is to join the winning side, and this opinion is by no means generally held at present, levies will be most difficult to recruit and unreliable when recruited.
