The High Commissioner at Danzig has oon-curred in reduction of force at Danzig to 1 Liciht Cruiser and 2 Torpedo Boat Destroyers.
M E S 0 P Q T A&apos;l  I A.H.M.S. &quot;ARK ROYAL&quot; is due to leave Constantinople on 4th September for Basra, and is taking eleven D.H.9 machines and all personnelj about 35 Officers and 220 men.SOVIET   RUSSIA.It is reported that an expedition escorted by the Russian Icebreaker &quot;ALSXODER SIBIKEAHOFF&quot; left Archangel on 7th August for the Yenisei.BALTICRaskolnikoff, after having been appointed to oom-mand the Baltic Fleet, instituted a discipline week, during which prompt obedience to all orders was required.   This has made the new Naval High - Command very unpopular among the sailors,        who support the Soviet regime only so long as it is possible to obtain the conditions of life they wish. The channel between Petrograd and. Eronstadt is reported to be silting up due to lack of dredging, the, depth of water being no?/ 22&quot; ft. instead of former 29 ft.   Attempts to improve conditions in the harbours have failed, and cranes, storing sheds, etc., are in a very bad state of repair. There is also a serious shortage of engineers and skilled workers. Although the Bolsheviks control the Donetz Basin, the Volga and&apos;Caspian, the shortage of coal and oil fuel is still very acute.   It is reported that Germans, dressed as Bolsheviks, are assisting in reconditioning ships.   It is generally considered at &quot;Kronstadt that the Fleet will put to sea when ready.   A report has been received that more minefields have been laid.   The &quot;Temps11 reports an explosion on board the Bolshevik ship nRed Dawn1 (sKrasnaya Sarya&quot;), as a result of which 130 of her crew were killed and the vessel sank.   This ship cannot be identified.The U.S. Navy Department has informed the Naval Attache, Washington, that the U.S.S. &quot;Pittsburgh and possibly; two Destroyers have been ordered to Danzig from Reval&quot;to secure American interests in case of need.The S.S. &quot;VoroneJ&quot; repatriating Poles and  Letts to the Baltic, will probably not arrive at Chatham Until 11th September.NORWAY.It is reported that the new Naval Budget, in which 15,822,000 Kr. are asked for  has been passed by the Storthic? ..Gr E R Li A N Y.The 14th Convoy of surrendered German war vessels arrived at Rosyth on 2nd September.TOUTED   STATES.Longshoremen, coal handlers and other nsnual labourers employed in connection with Cunard, White Star and other British freight and passenger lines struck on August 23th in sympathy with and at the instigation of Irish organ-i sat ions, as a protest against the treatment of Archbishop
ft401mm    J    **&quot;Mannix and MoSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork.CHIN A,Admiral SAH, the Qilnese Minister of Marine, does not , apparently, concern  himself much in party strife; his main oojGot is to get some pay for the Navy,   It &quot;will &quot;be remembered that more than two years ago the Chinese Navy, in its endeavour to got its pay * divided itself, into two portions, one attaching itself to the &quot;North&quot; and the other to the &quot;South&quot;.   A re&apos;-united Navy would be a strong factor in the re-establishment of general order, but so far no sucoess has attended any efforts which may have been made in this direction.
SECTION   II.GENERAL   BIT ELLIGEN0E.HESQP OTA M, I. A.The Cabinet have decided that the rebels must be quelled effectually, and every endeavour will be made to meet all the requirements of General Haldanee   It has been arranged to send 19 additional &quot;battalions from India.   The third air squadron should shortly be available for action, and the fourth air squadron (the 55th) has been ordered from Constan-tinople to Basra with all speed.   Thus, by the middle or end cf October General Haldane should be possessed of effective striking forces, and a vigorous use o? these to put down and punish disaffection, combined with the policy of setting up an Arab State, should bring about a &quot;better situation.Generally speaking the situation is quieter; the main danger is that the dissatisfaction will spread to the tribes on the Tigris line of communication at present quiet, and it is hoped that the arrival of fresh troops will prevent this. . The Arabs, at this time of the year,, are dependent on the Tigris as the canals are dry, and they not only see the troops moving up, but are conscious of their vulnerability to attack both by the troops and by the gunboats.PERSIA.The Persian Cossacks, after capturing Resht, attempted to retake Enseli, but were defeated and&quot;have retired behind a position now occupied by our troops at Menjil, and are now re-forming.   The Cossacks encountered a force of some 2,000, include ing a Russian brigade from Baku; the enemy have not pressed the pursuit and their nearest post is believed to be at Sanjar near Resht.A later aeroplane reconnaissance report states that the Bolsheviks are leaving North Persia, no troops having been seen at Resht, nor shipping at Enzeli.The Cabinet have decided that the British force in Persia shall be maintained until the spring to assist the Persian Government and the Officer commanding the North Persian Force, and has been instructed to defend Teheran from the direction of Enzeli, and repress local disorders, but not to undertake ? qpSK^ssive action against Bolshevik or other forces beyond the limits of Zinjan and Menjil.FINLAND.An unexpected hitch has occurred in the Dorpat negotia-^&apos; tions owing to the sudden demand by the Soviet Government for territorial compensation in the Karelian Isthimus in exchange for concessions in Karelia and Petchenga territory - the demands include, Terijoki, Raivola and certain islands in the Gulf of Finland, and run up to the Finnish first line of defence. -DANZIG.The general situation at Danzig has much improved. Labour has decided to proceed with the unloading of ships and despatch of goods to Poland, provided no Polish troops are sent.
-5- - 403SOVIET   HOSSIA.There is apparently no improvement in the internal conditions in Soviet Russia.The Polish offensive in the Northern Sector was not a complete success. Gaiakhan, the Bolshevik leader, with remnants of his forces, succeeded in crossing the East Prussian frontier. The total number is estimated at approximately 50,000. Germany is anxious that these internees should be transported to other parts of Germany as it would be difficult effectively to guard them with the local troops available.In the centre the position is generally quiet.   The Bolsheviks claim to have occupiei several villages to the East of Brest-Litovsk.   In the South, General Haller succeeded in surrounding Budennie. s Army, but the latter managed to break tiirough and retired behind the River Bug, having suffered a severe defeat with heavy losses.BALTIC.Lithuania.   The Lithuanians are now in complete possess-ion of Vilna and&apos;their troops are advancing to the line Skidel -Lida - Csehmiana.   The General Staff reports that the Poles have crossed the Augustovo Canal and attacked Lithuanian troops, in-flioting several casualties; they have entered Suwalki and Sejny and demand Lithuanian withdrawal to the Poch line.   Lithuanians demand Polish withdrawal to the August ovo Canal and intend to resist any further advance.   Orders to this effect have been given by the S&amp;nister for V/ar unknown to the Lithuanian Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs.Latvia, Finland and Esthonia are about to conclude a defensive alliance, excluding Poland until the latter has made peace with the Soviet Government.   *SOUTH   RUSSIA.It is stated that v7rangel intends to retire to the Crimea, forming a defensive barrier at Perekop and to continue operations in the Kuban and Trans Caucasus.0 A U,C A S I A.Azerbaijan.   The Azerbaijan Government has sent a telegram Litvinoff&quot;sfatijig that it consents to erchancre the British Prisoner at Baku for the Turks now at Malta&apos;, a list of ^homwill be sent in a few days.   This would indicate close touch with the Kemallst Nationals.Trans-Oaucasus.   Unrest in Trans-Caucasus is still preva-lent$ risings are reported in the Kiziliar and Mineral!-Vodi districts.POLAND.The Polish Government state that the Lithuanians are attacking them along the whole line from Grodno to August ovo. ^ The Polish troops have orders to avoid contact as- far as possible. The Poles assert that they are nowhere on Lithuanian territory, since the old Suwalki district has been recognised as belonging to Poland.   Meanwhile Poland is appealing to the League of Nations and will give the Lithuanians 10 days in which to retire to their territory.
HAL YeThe representative of Soviet Russia, Vorowsky, has pleaded illness as a reason&apos; for not coming to Rome.,, Litvinoff has been proposed as substitute, but the Italian Government, decline&apos;to receive him on account of his antecedents.Italy is, at present, endeavouring to improve her relations with the Danubian States, and shares their aversion to the B&apos;rench idea of a Danubian Confederation.ALBA N I A.The Jugo-Slav Government is taking up the attitude of favouring the independence and integrity of Albania, as defined in 1913, but consider that this must be complete, &apos; which will not be the case so long as Italy retains the island of Sasseno (as laid down in the recent agreement concluded between Italy and Albania).The indication is that Jugoslavia hopes to get Scutari as a set off to Sasseno.It is understood that the Jugo-Slav Government have invited the four Great Powers to send a commission to Albania to enquire into the situation on the spot.SYRIAThe Lebanon was proclaimed a State on September 1st by the French High Commissioner in Syria (General Gouraud). The boundaries of the new State have been fixed as followsOn the North the Nahr-el-Eebir ( a river running into the Mediterranean West of Horns); on the South the Palestine border; on &quot;the East the Ante-Lebanon Mountains, and on the West the sea*C U A D 0 R,Sr. Jose Luis Tamayo assumed the Presidency of Ecuador on 51st August, 1C2Q.germany military report states that the Reichswehr and Sioherheitspolizei are being mobilised all over Germany. Reichewehr troops are reported on the move in large numbers in the direction of the Neutral Zone from Bavaria and Saxony.Tbe ostensible reason for the increased military activity is fear of imminent Bolshevik risings in the Ruhr industrial area,The German Goverment have acknowledged the Soviet Government as the de facto Government of Russia.
0 H ISAEarly in August the Anfu Club was dissolved by mandate and a new Cabinet formed with. Chin Yun Peng, a friend of Ohihli, as Minister for T,7ar5 Yen Hui Ohing, formerly LUnister at Berlin, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Admiral Sah Oh en Ping as Minister for the Navy.   Yen Hui Ching has goiie out&apos;of his way to express himself as being particularly desirous of ^ood relations with Great Britain. Ho &quot;has indicated that China takes a keen interest in the British attitude to the questions of Shantung, the resumption of relations with Germany, relations with Russia and the renewal of the Anglo Japanese Alliance*i
