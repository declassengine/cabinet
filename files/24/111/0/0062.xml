Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Telegrams from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to Secretary of Stale for India,dated 11th September 1920.My telegram dated 3rd September, 10668. After visiting Sulaimaniyeh on 7th September, I proceeded to Arbil by air on the following clay on the way to Mosul. Position is most difficult there. The (? tribes) encouraged by their success at Rowanduz and Koi, show tendency to combine to oust Civil Administration and to loot Arbil.   Small mobile columns left Mosul and Kirkuk to-day for Arbil.Mosul Division is fairly quiet, but well-grounded fear of tribes obsesses towns-people. Stoppage of communication with Baghdad and practical isolation of the town has had depressing effect on all classes.On 9th September I visited Kirkuk by air on the way to Baghdad. Position here is much the same as Mosul, but generally tone is somewhat more optimistic, owing to the effective punitive measures recently taken against certain tribesmen.Situation in Mesopotamia. See my immediately preceding telegram. Except as therein stated, no change of importance since my telegram of the 3rd September, 11)658, which was repeated to Sir P. Cox. There is increasing anxiety in large towns at attitude of tribes, and with regard to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Situation from military point of view cannot yet be considered stabilised, but tide is likely to turn during next four or five weeks, as arrival of fresh troops will coincide with  commencement of the ploughing season, and with the cooler weather make troops more mobile. Moreover, munition supply of insurgents is beginning to run short. Beleaguered garrisons at Sainawah and Kufa are a source of some anxiety. All railway bridges from Samawah to Hillah exclusive (sic) have been burnt. Our detachments on the Tigris at (? Fallujah) (? Ramadi), Kirkuk and Kifri and at Mosul are all cut off from Baghdad at present, but there is no reason for anxiety on this score.Police in the towns and levies in the districts continue to do almost uniformly excellent work, so long as they are under British officers whom they know, and have some measure of support from our troops.It is of interest to note that effect of publication in local Arabic press, of Lawrence&apos;s letters to The Times, and of The Times editorial articles on each side of the subjects (sic) have evoked among educated Arabs, as far as I can learn, little but surprised (sic) that anyone claiming to speak with authority should so misapprehend the realities of the situation in Mesopotamia. Laurence is not personally known here even by (? name). I have been approached by a number of Busra notables who wished to send a telegram to Mr. Asquith (? protesting against) his attitude with regard to evacuation of Mesopotamia.1*  jv^X&amp;rifc,J22^8  100  9.20
