This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate to the Cabinet this series of telegrams from Mesopotamia and Persia. They show the increasingly serious military and political situation arising in those countries. Every effort is being made by the War Office to reinforce the Mesopotamian garrison. Nineteen battalions are on the way or under orders, and two new air squadrons will shortly go into action. With these it is hoped that important operations may be undertaken when the weather gets cooler in October. Efforts are also being made to find as many troops as possible towards the additional two divisions and two cavalry brigades which General Haldane apprehends will be needed. It must, however, be understood that all troops sent to Mesopotamia increase the risks in the theatres from which they have to be withdrawn. In these circumstances, I trust the Cabinet will, before Parliament reassembles, give further attention to the Mesopotamian-Persian situation, which is from every point of view so deplorable and injurious to our interests.W.

Many tribesmen have left Baqubah, at any rate temporarily, since bombing raids on 21st August and 22nd August.Details names and Sheikhs would be meticulous, as population of this division comprises 22 small tribes amounting to only (?) some 3,500 rifles (?) and revolvers.

Information from this area has been necessarily scanty, but these raids in the last three cases have been mainly the work of the following tribes : Ubaid (Arabs), (one group undecipherable) Dauda (Kurds chiefly) (1,300 rifles) Baiyat (200 rifles).Part 5. 4. In the main, Sulaimaniyah Division is still steady, but Za(one group undecipherable)anah (Kurds) along the Kifri Sulaimaniyah road are openly hostile, and the Hamawand and Shuan are showing some restiveness.Roads are unsafe for caravans in both Kirkuk and Sulaimaniyah Divisions.5.

Rumaitha (?) incident arose from a minor matter (? viz.): Forcing release by his tribesmen of a Sheikh of (one group undecipherable) Walim Ramleh of Beni-Huchaily, who had been detained at Rumaitha by political officer. Strength of detachment which moved at once to deal with what seemed a trifling local disburbance, was ample for extent of (?) area affected, and actually greater than force which successfully quelled disturbance of not less threatening aspect which occurred eighteen months ago in same area.2. Please see Civil Commissioners telegram, No. 9450, of 5th August, to India Office, for general causes of present rising.In spite of obvious benefits of settled government there is among a community of semi-savage tribes a natural repugnance to his provision of labour (?) payment of taxes, and other disadvantages appertaining such a government.(Please see Civil Commissioners telegram of 12th August to India Office, No. (?) (97)00.)Part 2.  (?) These (?) reprisals, coupled with differences of religion and race between Governors and (?) governed, and the inevitable local grievances, provide a fertile soil for reception of anti-Government propaganda ; while (?) operating real influence is the fear of strong hand, which alone restrains the love of anarchy and looting, innate in Arabian sheikh and tribesman alike. Extremist party in Baghdad has been busy (?) with disemination of such propaganda for a long time, and has endeavoured to imbue the movement with spirit of relapse to fanaticism by enlisting co-operation of anti-Government priesthood of the Holy City, while at the same time giving it a national and semi-constitutional colouring for the eyes of Europe.Part 3. -(? President Wilson)&apos;s (? points), League of Nations tenets, (? terms) of mandates (?) (and of) Anglo-French declaration, over-cultivation of (?) (aspirations) (of) Nationalism by our own obstinacy in Syria and Hedjaz and discussions in British Parliament and press have not only perverted semi-educated minds with ideas which they are (one group undecipherable) to quell, but have made it difficult to deal drastically with agitators of education who point to these as their (one group undecipherable).3. Although in (?) several divisions work of (?) settlement officers had (?) become more delicate and difficult in consequence of this propaganda, its (?) effect was apparent recently as to induce fear of general rebellion.   There were many possible centres of minor-disturbances over wide areas and. Rumaitha was in no way signalled out as particularly likely scene of such a (? state) (of ? lawlessness) or of wide spreading explosion.Part 4. 4. This spread, though partly attributed to propaganda at first, has been carried on mainly from love of anarchy and loot lanned continually it is true by religion,, but influenced, little, if at all, by Nationalism.A point unknown to me, and, therefore, unappreciated until the rebellion spread rapidly is that the blood feuds between tribes, which in pre-war times enabled the Turks to play off tribe against tribe, have been killed by three years British administration.Our administration in this respect has been so effective as to accomplish the miracle of an accommodating Shiah and Sunni settlement, thus adding to the difficulties of the situation still further.Part 5. The reduction of the garrison of this country to dimensions suitable to a country at peace liable to small local disturbances at intervals, is therefore, the cause of the present situation.Its weakness and inability to deal with more than one area at a time being once revealed by outbreaks of greater scope, the subsequent spread of anarchy has been natural logical sequence.Premature movement and withdrawal of troops from other areas to anticipate frequent alarms which often proved baseless would have been a manifestly unsound policy.I had only one brigade in reserve, this (?) being at Tekrit where interference in June with Baghdad Mosul&apos;lines of communication had necessitated retention of force.
The brigade, which should have been at Baghdad, had to be for some months on active operations on the Upper Euphrates.Concentration of adequate force to deal with extensive rebellion therefore necessarily took time, and interruption of railway lines further delayed this concentration.Part 6 follows.Note by 0 2.

The time factor is of first importance. Further reinforce-ments might have proved unnecessary had a full additional division been available in Baghdad early in August. Now, however, inability to deal at once with tribes up Baghdad-Quraitu line has already led to unrest spreading to Kurdish tribes, and before this can be settled these may deeply involve over increasing area. Tribes on Tigris and Shatt-Al-Hai are hanging in the balance and outbreak among latter reported imminent, while all tribes between Fallujah and Baghdad are (?) already out. I would mention, in revision of anticipated (?) troops, I have at various times asked for more (?) aeroplanes, more light armoured cars and for tanks. None of these were forthcoming and I have therefore remained deficient of (one group undecipherable) means to meet emergencies, and shortage of officers has also been brought to notice.(P. 6060).From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to Foreign Office.5th August 1920.-(No. R. 9450.) (Received 9th, 8 a. m.) .Your telegram dated 2nd August. Causes of present rising. My telegrams for last 18 months have recorded steady inflow of propaganda from Syria and to a less degree from Turkey, supported by ample funds. See particularly my telegram dated 15th May, No. 5803. So long as our military weakness was not apparent, this propaganda, the objects of which were largely foreign to ideas of people at large, had little success, except in Baghdad, Kerbela and Najaf, where sentimental leaders have always been more or less in sympathy with idea of pure Islamic State, vide my -telegram of 26th January, 1919, No. 1076.It was not, however, until our enemies in Syria demonstrated to people of Mesopotamia that we could be dislodged by (corrupt grouping up that movement became dangerous. We successively evacuated Dair-az-Zo and Albu Kemal and Alquim, on ^ach occasion under pressure from Syrian Government.Trains were detailed between Baghdad and Mosul and our officers were murdered at Tel Afar. Public confidence in our ability to maintain order began to wane. Extremists began to hope that they might be successful in attaining their object, viz., complete independence and freedom from all foreign interference by direct action. Kerbele and Najaf became principle centres of agitation. (It will be remembered that I had to deport a number of men from Kerbela in September, 1919, to prevent a rising and Najaf was scene of disturbance in 1918.)The arrest of Mirza Mohammed Riza and others aD Kerbela in June and of certain minor personages at Hillah stablized the situation of Hillah division, but owing to our military weakness we were unable to take similar action in Shamiyah division, where we only had some 300 men and two guns.This division, which has always borne a bad reputation, vide Administration Report for 1918, became a focus for intrigues.Meanwhile the announcement of terms of peace with Turkey had, as anticipated * an unfavourable effect on public opinion, and it enabled extremists to rally to their cause much useful material in the form of ex-Turkish officials and (corrupt group) large body of public opinion, who wished for maintenance of Turkish Empire and resented acquisitions of Greece.
y(P. 6204)From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to Foreign Office.J 2th August, 1920.(No. 9700.) (Received 16th, 9 a.m.)Our telegram of nth August, No. 9450, dealt with more immediate cause and objectives of the present rising in the middle Euphrates, the most important factor in (? which was) propaganda from Baghdad. I did not deal with reasons underlying loss by the civil administration of that degree of popularity which it first enjoyed.1. In the light of our experience of past three months, I think that we must plead guilty of going too fast in various administrative matters affecting tribes of (corrupt group). The blame for this must be distributed about equally between administration and the Sheikhs, and other (? tribal) leaders. We have; as a matter of policy, backed the Sheikhs (? and) supported their authority. They in their turn have tried to (? word ommitted) too great a burden on their tribesmen, with the laudable intention of improving Cultivation and ensuring good crops, by extensive work on clearing (? canals) and making bunds, and incidentally have lined their own (? pockets) (? very) substantially. The Sheikhs have discovered too late (? that they) did not ^possess influence that they were supposed to have over their tribesmen, and. are suffering accordingly.2. ,Another factor of (? no little consequence) peculiar to Mesopotamia which ;has-tended to cause discontent is the gradual appearance in Mesopotamia of what may be called post-war conditions. High prices, shortage of certain necessaries, &amp;c. (three corrupt groups) in the case of certain (? classes) of the population, but the wealth whichComing as it did at beginning of Ramazan, and synchronizing with our evacuation of Enzeli and Resht, and reports of Bolshevik successes in other parts of the world, it gave extremists an opportunity, of which they were not slow immediately to avail themselves, to represent us on the one hand as pursuing an anti-Islamic policy, and, on the other hand, as rapidly growing weaker.At this point other foreign influences commenced to make themselves felt, notably United States Consul and other United States citizens, who, I have every reason to know, make it their business to convey to extremists in detail all references in English Press unfavourable to local and Imperial policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, notably articles from the Times, which are freely referred to by extremists in their public speeches and conversations. In this connection we know that 7,000/. in Turkish gold reached extremists in Kerbela during May and June.Certain Shamiyah chiefs, whom we were, as already explained, unable to arrest, directed their energies to cause a rising in Samawah-Rumaitha area, realizing easily that this is the most vulnerable point in our communications in Mesopotamia. This area has never been penetrated by our troops, and is in fact impenetrable; for the past year it has been in an unsatisfactory state, see my Despatch, date 20th July, No. 21256, reporting events leading up to recent punitive expedition there.The outbreak occurred at Rumaitha on 3rd June; had we been able to despatch troops in adequate numbers promptly to the rising, it would not, I think, have spread, and situation in Shamiyah, where no rising took place for another 15 days, would have been dealt with (? by) diplomatic means. But we were not in a position to do so, and the rising slowly spread in consequence.Objectives of present rising. The tribes have been led to believe that it is a holy war, and Chief Mujtahid of Kerbela is actively preaching a Jihad, and has sent hundreds of emissaries all over middle Euphrates districts in this connection. The chiefs of tribes in Hillah and Diwaniyah divisions have mostly followed their tribesmen - rather than led them.The demands of rebellious leaders so far (? formulated) are complete expulsion of British from Mesopotamia, and an &quot; Islamic Kingdom.&quot; The Shamiyah, this means the theocratic state, which is their ideal; to tribes it means no Government at all, or Government by chiefs whom they&apos; can ignore at will, to a small minority of towns people it connotes an Amir.I do not think rebels have any grivances, taxation is light and (? harvest good) were there any such grievances, area of disturbance would not be limited as now to Shia districts within reach of Najaf and Kerbela. Tribes do not, of course, like paying taxes any more than other people, but this would not of itself have been cause of rising had we not been weak, and had not external causes above referred to exist.
is tasted by the country by Army of Occupation, but large classes feel pinch, and we, as the victors in the world war, have in Mesopotamia as elsewhere to bear odium of having brought these conditions about.3. But perhaps first in order of (corrupt group) importance comes perception of our military weakness. To kick a man when he is down is the most popular pastime in the East, sanctioned by centuries of precept and practice.4. Adverse influence of Shiahs Mujtahids, who have been against all government since the (? days of) Caliph.5. President Wilson&apos;s 14 points, and agitation created thereby and stimulated by Sheriflian, Turkish and (corrupt group) agencies both voluntary and paid.6. Difference of race and religion between British and Naval Civil Service used more as an excuse than as a cause itself.7. Delay in defining status of Mesopotamia, and, in consequence, maintenance of (corrupt group) British administration long after the Armistice.   If my recollection serves (?me) right as recently as October, 1918-19 (sic), (? I was) warned against &quot; taking any action or making any announcement such as would give the impression that we had been given or would accept mandate for Mesopotamia.8. The influence of Syria, where liberal British subsidy enabled Sheriffian Govern-ment to pay to its officials, particularly in the Army, emoluments far in excess of those which this or any other administration, organized on a self-supporting basis, could afford.9. (Corrupt group) for labour on flooding banks. The xlrabs would rather risk a flood, an act of God, than do heavy work on flooding banks, the work of the English (corrupt group) (? which the) circumstances of military occupation have been partly responsible for. We have throughout been, and indeed still are, subjected to considerable legitimate pressure from the military authorities to maintain bunds in such a state of efficiency (? as will) preclude any risk of railways being cut or cantonment (-? areas) of being flooded. It was on this condition (? that the) Irrigation Department was taken over (? by the) civil administration.10. Collection of land revenue and other taxes.11. Fear of exploiting (corrupt group) by Western commercialism.12. Use of aeroplanes against recalcitrants.13 Disappointment of (? landed interests), who reject the idea that landlords have duties as well as rights, and resent as &quot; illegal&quot; any attempt to withhold full measure of their pound of flesh from cultivator, who in their turn resent any attempts on the part of Government to use forces of law and order for recovery of dues on behalf of landlords. Complexity of Turkish law on this subject often makes the position of Political Officers exceedingly difficult.14. It is held by many here, both British and native, that I made a mistake in not dealing with prominent agitators here drastically before the movement had reached its present dimensions. This, however, is a matter of opinion (corrupt group). An adminis-tration of this sort at such a juncture must necessarily have great difficulty in deciding at what point a constitutional movement becomes so seditious as to demand or justify repression. Impracticable as are their aims, they have for the most part endorsed at one time or another in official pronouncement (? valuable services of) His Majesty&apos;s Government, and having regard to wording of Article 22 of the League of Nations, I doubt whether we should have been justified in arresting those who now declare themselves to be unwilling to accept a British (?

(No. X 9998, cipher.) (Received 29th, 0900.)The gravity of the situation is considerably enhanced by two (?) imminent dangers which by (?) their direct and indirect (?) effect and by increasing the (?) number of simultaneous commitments threaten to produce a situation approximating in some degree to that outlined in my No. X, dated 22nd July, 1919, attached.The dangers are : (a.) Threatened rising of Muntafiq. (b.) Spread of unrest to Kurdish tribes.The Muntafiq number some 43,000 rifles and cover the area from Salat Sikar (one group undecipherable) via Nasiriyah and the Hammarlake to Qurna. Though they include the best fighting tribes in the country these tribes liveon the (?) left of the (?) Euphrates and it is unlikely that appreciable numbers will leave their own country.No tribe of the confederation Ab (one group undecipherable) (?) on the Tigris lines of communication and the confederation itself is headless and in no way a homogeneous whole. (?) These factors materially (?) limit scope for direct action of these tribes, but (?) the following probable developments must be taken into consideration : (1.) Concentration of 5,000 to 10,000 against Nasiriyah.(2.) Closing of lines of communication by water from Qurnah to Nasiriyah.(3.) Raids on Basrah Nasiriyah railway.Troops on the spot are sufficient for contingency (l), but their (?) range of offensive action will be very limited, and the relief of Samawah will necessitate the co-operation of at least another brigade (2), so long as railway is maintained contingency (2) is of no immediate military consequence as there are no Najd-Shammar south of the railway, trans-frontier and the Bedouin Dhafir are (one group undecipherable) beyond temporary interruptions.   Railway commnnication should be secure.Clear the line.From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Handed in 28th August, 1920, 0115. (No. X 9998, cipher.) (Received 29th, 0900.)A more vital danger is the indirect results from spread of anarchy to (?) contiguous tribes on the Tigris lines of communication, supported by the usual religious and Nationalist propaganda. The Muntafiq (? on the) Shat-al-Hai (?) (one group undecipherable) touch the Benirabiya (5,500 rifles) who live between Backhaileh and Kut and communicate across the Lower Jezireh with the Benilam (5,500 rifles) and Abudrraj (4,300 rifles) and down stream of Amarah with the Abu muhammadan(?)mid (8,000 rifles) (two groups undecipherable)ich Brigade (10,000 rifles). Of these the last two tribes are (?) Marsh (?) dwellers against whom it would be extremely difficult to take effective punitive action and other marshy tribes in area bordering their habitat number some 8,500 more rifles.Should the (?) Benirabiya be affected trouble might not improbably spread to the Zubaidand Shammar to Qah between Kut and Baghdad. These tribes number 3,150 rifles and the result of their disaffection would be danger to communications between Kut and and Baghdad both by (?) road and rail.
Clear the line.From General Headquarters, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Handed in 28th August, 1920, 0125. (No. X 9998, cipher.) (Received 29th, 0900.)The spread of unrest to Kurdish tribes only involves three or four small tribes up to date, totalling 2,000 rifles, but disaffection amongst important Hamawand and Shuan (? tribes), who together total some (? 92)00 rifles,*is significant, and if it materializes, may run through Kirbuk and Sulaimani divisions and (?) through the (?) soldiers northwards right along the Kurkish front. This would involve some 22,000 within or around the line of our outpost tribes, totalling practically the same strength living rather further afield, and doubtless most of those with whom we have engaged at one time or another would send contingents against any punitive force within reasonable distance of their homes. (? The main tribes), however, in Kirkuk and Sulaimani divisions are still quiet as well as those further north, and it is largely in the hope of arresting further spread that I am initiating operations as early as possible up the Baghdad Quraitu line, despite calls for troops elsewhere.This has, however, made it necessary to limit offensive operations on the Middle Euphrates, and to defer action against the Zoba between Baghdad and Fallujah. Though the Dulaim are at present steady, this enforced inaction over a considerable period may react in our (? disfavour), and the factor is not unimportant as they total 27,000 rifles.Clear the line.From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Handed in 28th August, 1920, 2305. (No. X 9998, cipher.) (Received 29th, 0800.)As regards the Bedouins, the Dhafir and Najdshammar, I have already touched on. The Amaret section of the Anaizah which is the only one of importance to us. is helping us and I do not anticipate trouble from them. The inclination of Bedouins is now to co-operate (?) in (?) settlement of river area tribes.The only Bedouin tribe which we have to reckon with at present appears to be Shammarjarba, who are now moving to south parallel to the Baghdad Mosul lines of communication, and who normally camp west of this line between Shergat and Samawah for season.I have been compelled, owing to commitments elsewhere, to denude this line of communication of troops, and the prospect of its being cut off for a considerable time is one that I have for some time been prepared to face until troops are available to reopen it.From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Handed in 22nd July, 1919, 1520&apos;. (No. X 7257.) (Received 23rd, 0740.)Please see India Office telegram of 15th July (attached) to Civil Commissioner and his reply No. 8107 (attached) of 19th July, in which I have concurred.(8532) B 2The danger is real and demands measures to provide against it, but for three reasons I have hopes of avoiding serious trouble on the Tigris lines of communication : (1.) The tribes, though armed and observant, are at present steady.(2.) A considerable moral effect is produced by the sight of the troops coming up continually as well as by the gunboats.(3.) Practically every canal between Baghdad and Amarah is dry in the low water season.This is a most important factor as it makes tribes dependent largely on the Tig i is. They camp and water their flocks on the banks and are fully conscious of their accessibility and consequently vulnerability both to troops and gunboats.
As military situation is much affected, should be glad if my views could be put before His Majesty&apos;s Government. Foreign Office propose to reply to a petition received through Egyptian force from certain Mesopotamians in Sheriffian army, who f have neither status nor backing in this country. We have already given pledges that we shall govern according to the wishes of the people if we are the mandate for this country. There are neither leaders nor class, nor opinion existing able to take an advanced part; half the population Arabs, Persians, Kurds, Jews and Christians (?) Shaih and Sunni, all grouped and mutually unsympathetic. Sheriffian Persians, pan-Kurd, pan-Arab, pan-Islam, and C.U.P. intrigues are rife, added to Russian Bolshevism and Indian sedition. This is the real centre of Jewry and weak traders, as well as the ancient churches. Government by sympathetic political officer has been very successful, and must continue for some time. The term bureaucrat of proposed Foreign Office reply under reference is most unsuitable description. At present Kurdish unrest due to intrigues, which has called half of my force into the field. Between Baghdad and the sea, on the Tigris alone are nearly 100,000 well-armed mounted Shiah Arabs, for the moment exceedingly well pleased with our system, but do not themselves know the motives that sway them. The Euphrates has nearly as many more. All trace of river and rail routes would be closed by unrest among them. The armed population liable to be disturbed is over half a million, and any false momentary stop may ma^e the doubling of the garrison necessary, and all progress impossible. The only possible course is the gradual development of present sympathetic system and the training of Arabs to be honest officials.Repeated to Field-Marshal Allenby and India.[Copy.]&apos; From Secretary of State to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad.(No. P. 3912.) 15th July, 1919.Foreign Office have received through General Headquarters, Egypt, representations from influential Arab officers of Mesopotamian origin, at present serving in Aleppo district, pressing for early establishment of a purely national civil Government in Mesopotamia in accordance with the terms of Anglo-French Declaration of November last, while maintaining Army of Occupation for the present. Officers emphasize importance of making change before present system has been allowed to crystallize. Foreign Office think it impolitic to ignore representations altogether and propose to reply (1.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government fully realize objections to crystallization of western bureaucratic methods in Mesopotamia ; (2.) That certain steps, e.g., formation of provincial and divisional Councils arealready being taken to ensure such Arab participation as compatible with military occupation; and (3.) That if and when we obtain mandate British Commission will be sent out assoon as possible to discuss in consultation with all classes form of future government.Please telegraph your views.Repeated to Viceroy, Foreign Department.Priority A.[Copy.]From Baghdad to India Office.(No. 8107.) Received 21st July, .1920, 6 p.m.Your telegram dated 15th July, received 19th : 1. I presume communication referred to is that sent to Foreign Office on 8th June by Egypt.2. Please see Cairo telegram No. 172 of 1st February to Enzeli, forwarding representation from same source, which gives the views of the same group of persons
with somewhat greater frankness. It appears to have remained unanswered without untoward results.   The other 300 are very small fry.3. Naji Beg, one of the signatories, has been here for over a month with his fedsia and brothers, and I have had several conversations with him. His views, as voiced to me and Lieut.-Colonel Balfour after some little time here, and realized the task of forming an Arab Government in a short time from Arab material, fell far short of Major Brayne&apos;s somewhat imaginative exposition, which seems to represent latter&apos;s views at least as much as those of his hearers.4. Naji Beg has admitted views he held at Aleppo are largely the outcome of misapprehensions. Several Baghdad officers from Aleppo are with him and may be considered to constitute the deputation proposed by General Clayton.5. I have offered him the post of Assistant to the Military Governor, Baghdad (corrupt group (?) attached), President Municipality on Rs. 1,000 a month. He has accepted, but finds the actual work getting things going so onerous that I anticipate he will shortly resign.6. Of the other signatories, enquiries from local notables and from other sources ; show that they are not now regarded as influential, and they would not command any considerable following on this side.   They may compare to the Irish politicians in America, graciously pleased to prefer to expound their theoretical views on foreign soil.7. I depricate proposal that a communication from such individuals should be eligible for an important pronouncement by His Majesty&apos;s Government (in this connection, see your telegram of 5th July). Moreover, the word &quot; commission&quot; has recently come to connote in Near East a body with powers which transcend those of governments, and announcement of the appointment of such a body, whatever its nationality, would be widely misunderstood and would increase our difficulties here without in any way allaying the apprehensions or curbing the activities of the extremists of Aleppo.8. The petitioners might reasonably infer from the first paragraph of the draft reply that we have in fact introduced western bureaucratic methods into Mesopotamia. This is far from being the case. There is a bureaucracy, but it is oriental. I question, however, the desirability of the use of the word &quot; bureaucratic,&quot; which is liable to create prejudice. The local alternatives to the method so stigmatised are those of autocracy or anarchist, neither of which are desired locally.9. Reference to paragraph patriarchs draft reply. I warmly advocated untenable a commission to this country in 1917 and 1918, but conditions have changed and considered announcements made here on King&apos;s birthday, which are known in Aleppo through the Arab Press, are regarded statements of the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to pursue ; as such they have done a great amount of good. It is not to be expected that they should satisfy everybody, but it is generally agreed that they go as far as is consistent with maintenance of order in tribal districts, on which ultimately the prosperity of the country depends, and appointment of Naji Beg as assistant to Military Governor of Baghdad has gone far to convince even the politicians of Baghdad of our bona fides. In this respect things have1 changed since Clayton wrote. Incidentally this step is likely to give them practical experience of the extreme difficulty of forming anything like a local Arab Government in this country out of Arab material from whatever source obtainable.10. As regards representations of the signatories and views of Major Brayne, my only comment for the moment is that maintenance in this country of an army of occupation is not a substitute for administration of country districts on present lines which are both satisfactory to tribes, who form (corrupt group (?) nine)tenths of the population, and also consistent with the maintenance of order.11. Any radical change in present form of administration would involve wide-spread disturbances with which an Arab Government would be powerless to deal and against which neither our present (? scanty) forces nor any forces which His Majesty&apos;s Government could be expected to keep in this country could successfully contend.12, I, therefore, suggest the reply should be restricted to an intimation that writers appear to have been misinformed as to the progress of events in Mesopotamia, and that it is open to them to go to Mesopotamia to see things for themselves.The reply should preferably reach petitioners from liaison officer at Aleppo.Repeated to His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Minister at (corrupt), Simla and Cairo.

Clear the Line.From General Headquarters, Mesopotamia, to War Office. (Handed in 28th August, 1920, 0700. (No. X 999(?)9, cipher.) (Received 29th, 0900.)Part 1. The (group omitted) Muntafiq disturbance is (?) developing and a violent Jehad is being preached. Assistant political officer Shattrah has had to be withdrawn, and future developments depend upon the extent to which the Sheikh Khaiyun, who has hitherto worked whole-heartedly for us and has been now appointed assistant , political officer, is able to stem the tide of fanaticism. If the Muntafiq throw in their lot with the insurgents, as seems probable, a new situation will arise. The infection will probably spread to Tigris tribes and the only lines of communication between Basra and Baghdad, by the (? river), will become precarious. Some Kurd tribes are already disturbed and others are likely to follow on the principle that it is better to fight than to do nothing.From General Headquarters, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Handed in 28th August, 1920. (No. X 9999, cipher.) (Received 29th, 0900.)Part 2.-Regarding possible tribal developments see my telegram No. .X 9998, (?) 28th August, in which I (?) examine these. We shall be faced in the event of these developments materializing by the situation foreshadowed in your telegram No. 82093, M.O. 2, 4th November, 1919, and in my opinion the only possible means, either of&quot; restoring order or of withdrawing, according as His Majesty&apos;s Goverment may decide, will be and additional force landed at Basra to operate thence.From General Headquarters, Mesopotamia, to War Office. * See amendment below.Handed in 28th August, 1920. (No. X 9999, cipher.) (Received 29th, 0830.)Part 3. This should consist of (?) all of the troops now in this country or promised, of two complete divisions, each with a cavalry brigade to operate up the Tigris and Euphrates respectively. The early arrival of such a force might even prevent the spread of disaffection to the extent otherwise probable. Two complete (?) corps would be required to co-ordinate the operations of all the forces in the country and establish a good organization. The Army in Mesopotamia would then be approximately equal to that which was found necessary in 1917-18 (?) to deal with the Turkish Army, whose numbers, though more organized, were very much smaller and more concentrated than those which will now be arrayed against us, and at a time when communications did not require as much protection as now. As its bearing on the Mesopotamia situation is known to you I have not referred to Persia. You may, of course, rely on me to do my utmost with the troops that I have at my disposal to falsify my estimate of probable developments, to check the spread of disorder and to restore peace and order in the areas now disturbed.Third and last part ends. 20/R.A.F./158From War Office to General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia.(No. 82023, cipher.
