M 11IRELAND.................................................. &quot; 11SUMMARY ------0------The prevailing optimism about the threatened miners1 strike has hitherto had no actual justification, though strong pressure has been exercised on Hr. Smillie, especially by the Yorkshire officials, to effect a settlement.   The miners have now however, appointed a Committee, which includes Smillie, Hodges, Hartshorn, Barker and Herbert Smith, to interview the President of the Board of Trade to-day, and it is proposed to call a Delegates1 Conference next Tuesday in London.   A large body of the miners want to avoid a strike and nearly all are indifferent about the 14s. 2d.   The   firm attitude of the Government has greatly x exercised the leaders, who had no idea that their bluff would&apos; not succeed and are disconcerted by the hostility of public opinion, but as surrender entails the resignation and extinction of Mr. Smillie a decision will probably be postponed until the very last moment.   It is even possible that the miners will have orders to continue work on a day to day contract.The possibility of a railway strike in sympathy with the miners must not be ruled out.   There is to be a Special General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen on Tuesday next to consider the question.   The railway shopmen at Gateshead passed a resolution last month, urging a national stoppage if their dispute was not settled; unusual secrecy is maintained and the &quot;Railway Review&quot; for September 17th does not refer to the matter.There are now hopes that the Electrical trades Union will withdraw their strike notices and a general Engineering stoppage will be avoided. ,The undercurrent at the recent Trade Union Congress disclosed a well marked movement to the Left on the part pf all
the delegates, &quot;but it also made it dear to the delegates themselves that Labour lives in a glass house.The Bhadow of unemployment, especially in the cotton      i industry, is growing darker.Local Councils of Action are taking on more and more the form of Soviets and in some&apos; areas they are forming plans for the seizure of private property and means of transport.Humours of a General Election are disturbing Trade union is v/ho would not like an appeal to the country on the miners1 claims.Attention is called to a new move on the part of the International Union of     Service Men, who attempted to hold their meeting without permission on the premises of a Labour Exchange.The disclosures regarding the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; subsidy from Russia are reported to have shaken the position of the paper an there is evidence that a conrsiderabls body of the workers has lost confidence in it.   !Se Labour leaders who are members of the Board realise that they have been placed in a very false position.
THE OPAL MINERSThere Is little change in the situation in the various coalfields. South wales in South Wales the feeling in favour of peace is growing and the men would like their loaders to have full powers to obtain the best possible terms without having to*. resort to a strike.   They think they ought to get an increase of Is. Od. a shift but they regard the demand for reduction in the price of ooal with some derision.   In the Rhymney Valley only about 50 per cent handed in notices and in the Aberdare valley the men complain that they were not properly consulted about the reduction in the price of coal.   The storm centre is the Rhondda valley, where 42,000 notices were handed in out of a possible 44,000.   This is always the hunting ground for extremists,   In the Monmouthshire Western Valleya it is alleged that members of the Workmen1a Committees themselves appended the names of individual miners to ballot papers and that in some casos notices were tendered on behalf of men who had left the employment weeks ago.The miners1 wives at Porth have recorded their &quot;intense indignation at the misrepresentation concerning the earnings and mode of living of the miners and their wives&quot; and have declared their intention of supporting the men.The mining officials, including the examiners, clerks and master hauliers, with a membership of 10,000, are calling upon the miners and the Government to set up a Tribunal and to leave no stone unturned to avert a strike.There is much revolutionary talk in the mining areas, but apparently no definite plans have been made, though many of the miners in conversation have declared that they will raid and loot provision shops.   The tradesmen are consequentlytalking/
talking; of shutting their shops and boarding up their premises,The public feeling against the minors in Wales is acute and there seems to be a general hope that the Government will defeat them.LancashireThe men in this district do not want a strike and are. determined to enforce what they regard as a very moderate claim for wages.   They will have nothing to&apos;do with the Industrial Court bocauso they cannot bargain with the Court and they can with the Government,  My correspondent thinks that if a strike occurs   the Federation of Lancashire and Cheshire will withdraw the firemen, enginemen. bollersnen and I pumpmen, regardless of consequences to themselves, YorkshireThe ikmeaster races have overshadowed the coal crisis and thero is nothing to report, Northumberland and DurhamIn those districts tho notices were tendered in block, Most; of the miners take no interest in the matter because $hey do not think a strike will be called, &quot;One side will have to give way&quot; they say, MidlandsHere, also, there is a lack of interest, and in Warwickshire a local race meeting and the Bedworth Flower Show, have diverted public interest/ Leicester and Nottingham. Here it is believed that the strike will not be general. The feeling is strong against it.   One intelligent miner told my correspondent that the Federation would probably defei making fresh proposals until the last moment and then would order v/ork to be continued on a daily contract. North StaffordshireIn North Staffordshire there is muoh grumbling aboutthe/
the shortage of tubs.ScotlandHere the miners want the increased wages but are not anxious to strike.   Their wives are against a strike and an opinion is growing that Mr. Smillie has overshot the mark.   The steadier men complain about the way in which the ballot was conducted.   One man said that when he returned to the pithead at 10,30 p.m. he found a dozen ballot papers lying beside the ballot bos and no one in charge.   Ho could, if he had wished, have filled up all&apos; these ballot papers and had the votes recorded.   In the event of a strike it is believed that attempts will be made to issue promissory notes to shop-keepers and if they do not accept them there is a possibility of rioting.Generally speaking, there is a feeling of optimism, which is scarcely warranted by any concrete facts.   An official at the Federation offices said the other day that there would be no strifes, and if this proved to be the case Mr. Smillie would resign in favour of Mr. Hodges, whom he described as an opportunist and not a fanatio.- trade UNION SUPPORT FOR THE MIUBRSAlthough an effort has been made to give an impression 1 of labour solidarity it is clear that the great body of the workers are against giving active support to themanyminers, though If their leaders called them out/of the railwayinen and transport workers would probably obey. Mr. CT. Cramp, in his article in the current issue of the &quot;Railway Review&quot;, says that the miners must not feel that they have, to fight this battle alone.    If the transport workers come out at the same time lt will be upon clafcns of their own and&apos; it is doubtful whether they would bring out the dockers.There is a rumour that the Amalgamated engineering union may join the Triple Alliance before the ooal strike in/
Ml     4tin. order ix) create an impression of Labour solidarity.It is reported that Mr, Bernard Shaw has undertaken to supervise the Propaganda Department of the Miners1 Federation and Mr, Robert Williams is to he Secretary of the Publicity Committee of the Triple Alliance,THE TRADE UNION CONGRESSIt is now possible to give a general impression of the undercurrents of the Congress,   A decided increase of revolutionary feeling was evident among the delegates. With the exception of Mr, Havelock Wilson, no delegate can be named who took a firm stand against the extreme views.   The general feeling seemed to be that the existing &quot;capitalistic&quot; order is doomed and it is only a question of organisation that delays its fall.   The decision to^inaugurate a &quot;General Staff&quot; is an instance, for here thev .   .   .dissentients raised objection to the detail rather than the principle.If one might judge from the reception of the various leaders one would say that the day of moderate men like Mr, Clynes is past, for his welcome was cold in comparison to that give to open revolutionaries like Williams, Mann and Smillie,   The personal attack on Mr, Appleton also illustrated the growth of revolutionary feeling.There were more recriminations between the officials and Unions than usual. When a delegate of the General Workers accused Muir, of the Electrical Trades Union, of telling a &quot;deliberate lie&quot; Mr. Thomas refused to allow the debate to proceed.In the opinion of one of the delegates of several years standing the debate on the miners1 claim was stage-managed.   He said that Mr. Ben Turner was &quot;always employed\ for that job&quot;, and that the Standing Order Committee had already drafted a resolution w!ben Mr. Bevin suggested referring the question to that Committee,   He said further that/
that SmillieS remarks on the bartering of votes were intended to attract vo^es for the miners1 delegates and that while he was speaking the miners were actually &quot;bartering.   Of Mann he said ,TWe all know Tom is a good chap hut nobody that matters takes the least notice of him.&quot;Another delegate stated that, in the ovent of a miners1 strike, the Triple Alliance would call out all its members but that the strike would last twanty-four hours. As regards the Presidents address, it is said in the &quot;Labour leader&quot; that a &quot;Committee of Censors&quot; sat upon the draft and struck out everything that ma of a controversial nature.   Generally speaking, all my correspondents agree that the responsible and moderate men have adopted more advanced views and are no longer Trade Unionists only.The Congress has added little to the prestige of Labour and its offspring - the General Staff arid the Parliamentary Committee - must remain in the cradle for some months, for the Parliamentary Committee cannot act until the voting system has been examined.   The next Annual Congress will be held at Cardiff and the basis of representation will be one delegate for 5,000 members instead of for 4,000 as heretofore.

Williams De Hicks Herbert SmithThe enquiry began at Ecoleston Square on September14th,THE &quot;COUNCIL GP ACT!OH&quot;On September 10th the national &quot;Council of Action&quot; ( issued a report in which it wa.a stated that over 300 local councils were then in existence, &quot;covering the most important industrial centres,&quot;  In regard to the suggestion that, failing peace with Buss ia, a definite date should be fixed for a general strike, the report adds:&quot;Several Local Councils have passed resolutions in favour of a definite date being fixed for the establishment of peace as an ultimatum to the Government,  Whilst this proposal is within the mandate conferred upon the Council by the National Conference, the Council must be trusted to move in this as in other directions when it is felt that circumstances warrant.   The same observation applies to resolutions in favour of stopping the export of ooal to France because of the policy of the French Government, . On this matter the Council is seeking complete understanding with French Labour,&quot;The situation is still full of sinister possibilities and prompt and decisive action may be necessary at any moment.   It ia hoped, therefore, that all Local Councils have appointed the Sxib-committee recommended in previous wmmunioations , so that should a grave emergency arise, plans may he available for meeting any eventuality,&quot;The 8D^ily HerajLd1 is our only organ in the press.

&quot;MAINTAIN YOUR 4GITATI0N AND KEEP YOUR        .    4 8 POIDBR DRY!&quot;In some distriots the local councils are extremely active; In Brighton, for instance, efforts are being made to deal with the questions of food and transport.   In regard to the former the Supply and Transport Sub-Committee urges all trade unionists to join co-operative societies and to store such food as is possible.   &quot;In the meantime it is suggested that a wider and more accurate survey be undertaken of all possible sources where supplies are procurable.&quot;  Under the heading &quot;Transport11, the sub-committee advocates- that &quot;an immediate enquiry and enumeration be made of all vehicles, public and private, horsed or otherwise, likely to be at our disposal, and that enquiry be made into the scheme of the National Union of Bailwaymen for obtaining and storing petrol.  A speedy, reliable and constant service for keeping us in touch with other centres may he obtained by the organisation of an effective Cycle Corps.&quot;   In regard to &quot;Distribution and Registration&quot; the sub-committee suggests &quot;that the Wards of the Town, 14 in number, be the units from which Ward Committees may effectively undertake the duties and facilitate the work of distribution and registration of strikers and their families.&quot;The Brighton Sub-Committee for &quot;Propaganda and publicity&quot; has been considering plans for the circulation of information in the event of a Press strike, when onlythe &quot;Daily Herald&quot; would be published.   They suggest thatthe Telegraph Section of the Union of Post Office workers and of the Railway movement be mobilised for this purpose,that a Cycle Corps he organised and that the town bemapped out into districts.   At Coventry the local councils proposing to abolish all local authorities and to setup Soviets under ihe cover of oouncils of Action to take their place.  My correspondent thinks that if a workingminority could be secured the organisers would get towork/
8*work and ignore the apathetic masses.   The Union officials are fraquerrtlng-.public houses and discussing the Soviet system.   The same process seems to he at work in Leicester though so far there is not much support in the Coventry and North Staffordshire districts.The &quot;Hands Off Russia&quot; Committee, which is keenly interested in the &quot;Council of Action&quot; movement, has suggested that a National Conference of lodal Councils should be held.   On the other hand, the Wearside branches of the boilormakers, with a membership of 10,000 will have nothing to do with the Sunderland Council of Action, and if they are joined by the blacksmiths and shipwrights the united committee would have a very steadying influence.It is significant that Mr. G.D.H. Cole, writing from the office in Bccleston Square to the &quot;Labour Leader&quot;, says:&quot;But let us make no mistake about what we are in for.  We are co-ordinating the forces of Labour not s&amp;nply in order to increase Labour1 a strength in negotiations, strikes and elections, we aro marshalling our battalions for an actual assault upon Capitalism, to be followed by an actual assumption of power,&quot;THE &quot;NO RENT&quot; CAMPAIGN  &quot;&quot;&apos;The feeling regarding increased rents is still running high in Glasgow.   vjfhen legal action has been taken the &quot;Red Flag&quot; has been sung so lustily outside the Court that the proceedings, have been interrupted.Eg-SERVICE MgjjLast night the International Union of Es-Serviee Men, which is a Bolshevik organisation, attempted to hold aImeeting in the Waiting Hall of the Ministry of Labour Office, St. Mary1s Road, Harlesden.   About 200 persons crowded into the.Ball and were addressed by the organiser,R. Jones/
R. Jones, who &quot;brought a portable   stand with him,   The police were called in and they left quietly and held their meeting at the house of Burgess,who has been alluded to in these reports.The significant point about the meeting is that, according to a person who was present, Jones appealed to the audience for those who had come armed to hold up ,their hands,   Nine men responded and went to the back of the platform, and Jone3 then said that he intended to march to the Exchange in St, Mary1 a Road to demand, by force if necessary, the adjustment of the claim of one J.A.H.Jefferies. He is said to have advised all present to come prepared to protect themselves and he would then attack the Exchange, pay out to their comrade his just demands and devote the surplus to the funds of his association.   The informant is prepared to give evidence,THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;There can be no question that the recent revelations have been a serious blow to the prestige of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,   It is reported that the mention of the word &quot;Herald&quot; by speakers in the louden area has provoked jeers and criticism; a collection at an extremist meeting at which the speaker eulogised the paper amounted to 3s, 3d, and he was told that the sum was a measure of the love of Kingston for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   It would appear that the workers are now beginning to doubt Mr. Dansbury^s &quot;honesty&quot;.THE COMMUNIST PARTY 01? GREAT BRITAINThe National Executive of the labour Party, through its secretary, Mr, Arthur Henderson, has informed the Communist Party of Great Britain that &quot;as the basis of &apos;-affiliation/
- 10 -raffiliation to the Labour Party is acceptance of its constitution, principles and programme, with which the declared objects of the Communist Party do not appear to be in accord&quot; the application for affiliation is refused.On September 11th some 150 extremists, representing El groups, met in Glasgow and formed &quot;The Communist Labour Party of Great Britain.&quot;   The constitution and rules of the party vd.ll be-formulated at a conference to be held in about 14 days1 time.   It is doubtful whether this party is more than a new name for the old extremist groups, but amalgamation with the Communist Party of Great Britain is not unlikely, in -view of the attitude of the Labour Party to that body.The Communist Parties are active in the provinces and my correspondent reports that in Manchester they hold meetings on opposite sides of Stevenson Square, the rival speakers interspersing their addresses with personal abuse!In Birmingham, Bishop has delivered a series of violent speeches, but the collections have bejon small.     IBoth parties are making the most of the present unrest and continually urge the workers &quot;to assume responsibility for the control of the resources of the country which is rightfully theirs and for the administration of the means whereby they live.&quot;TBS TglRL INTERNATIONAL   .. IThe conditions for admission to the Third Intern a ti oil laid down by the Second Moscow Congress are reported to have caused defections already in Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria, and steps will be taken to bring! them to the knowledge of the British working man.   They   j are remarkable examples of the arrogance of the Comrmmistymind/I
mind.   They are given as an Appendix to this report.SIM BETH IN GREAT BEITAIITThere has been.an^jncreaee-sl,n-ill,nri..Fein activity this week.   While the meeting for &quot;Bandsu0f^ 12th was poorly attended, in Glasgow Sinn Fein feeling is running very high and there are still threats of reprisals on members of the British Government if the lord Mayor of Cork should die.   On September 12th St. Andrew1 s Hall was not large enough to hold the people attending the Sinn Fein &apos; demonstration.   Speeches were very violent, the British flag was described as the flag of murder, militarism, rapine and arson and the Irish Constabulary described as hooligans, professional thieves and gutter snipes with bad Army records.  No decent ex-soldier,;it was said, wou&amp;d apply or would be accepted if.he did apply, for the Government wanted only men to vfctom murder, looting and arson came easy. These wastrels of humanity with professional burglary records were sent to raid houses of peaceful citizens in the dead of night and to shoot down the occupants.   The speakers were John Milroy and 0&apos;Sheehan.   Another speaker, MacFergus, said that they, the Sinn Feiners, had an army in Scotland, the best drilled and disciplined army in the world to-day, and that army was for use.Captain J.R. White is active in this area.IRSLA1TB. &apos;*J mm&apos; 1 &apos;l      &apos;Sinn Fein is becoming more aggressive.   336 outrages were reported during the week but the actual number committed was far larger;   of these 312 were directly attributable to Sinn Fein, six were of an agrarian nature and 20 were miscellaneous offences.In addition 185 cases of raiding for arms by gangs of masked and armed Volunteers were reported, many of theseraids/
- It -raids being carried out with every circumstance of terrorism.   Sinn Fein became aware that all permits to keep and carry arms were being cancelled and that the a were about to be taken up, hence this widespread raidingEleven vacated Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks, o courthouse and one coastguard station were burned down. H.M. Mails by rail and road were held up and robbed over .60 times during the week.   It is impossible to send any communication of importance through the post and the pos office, la full of disloyal persons.   Intimidation by threatening letters and notices, assaults, firing into dwellings, and malicious damage-was prevalent.   Three members of the Royal, Irish Constabulary and three civilisation were kidnapped during the week.   Resignations from the Royal. Irish..Constabuiary are becoming very numerous.There was no noticeable change in the labour situation and the railway impasse remains much the same. Trains on some sections of line, in the west particularly are few and uncertain.   The struggle seems likely to drag on for a long time; dismissed and suspended employee are far from satisfied but dare not openly mutiny against Sinn Fein. h$
A 5&apos;P&apos;BS&apos;M&apos;IgM Oj! THE THIRD IHTERMTIQMC,.1, The daily propaganda and agitation mustbe definitely Communist,  All the Party organs must be edited by positive Conmiuniets, havingfiven proofs of their devotion to the cause of he proletarian revolution.   It is not sufficient to speak of the dictatorship of the proletariat as of a recognised and understood formula; it must he propagated in such a way that the need for it is made clear to every workman, soldier and peasant from the facts of their daily life, whioh  must be systematically noticed in our jPress.    In the columns of the Press, at public meetings, in the Trade Unions, in the Co-operatives, everywhere  where the adherents to the Communist International have aooess, they must attack, systematically and implaoably, not only the &quot;bourgeoisie, hut also its accomplices, the reformists of all shades. -8t Every organisation wishing to affiliate tothe Communist International must regularly and - systematically remove all reformists and Centrists&quot; from all posts, however little responsibility thejr involve, in the &quot;working class movement (Party organisations, editorships, Trades Unions, Parliamentary sections, Co-operatives, municipalities), and replace them, especially at first, by experienced militants, and by workers risen from the ranks.3* In all oountries, where, inconsequence of astate of siege or emergency laws, the Communists are unable legally to develop all their activities, it is absolutely necessary that  &apos; legal action should be accompanied by illegal&quot; action.   In nearly all the European and American oountries, the class-struggle is entering upon the period of civil war.  Under these circumstances the Committals ts cannot depend upon &quot;bourgeois legality.  It is their duty everywhere t6 create, side by side with the legal organisation, a secret organisation, capable of fulfilling at the decisive moment Its duty towards the revolution4. .        Propaganda and systematic and increasing agitation among the troops must he carried on. A Communist nucleus must be formed in every unit. The greater part of this work will &quot;be illegal: &quot;but to refuse to do it would be a betrayal of revolutionary duty, and consequently incompatible with affiliation to the Communist International.5.           A vigorous and systematic agitation in the   , country districts is necessary.   The working class cannot win unless it is supported at least by a portion of the agricultural workers (farm labourers and the poorest peasants), and if it has not neutralised by its policy, at least some of the backward country districts.........The workei&apos;3 must bo shown systematically,that/
that without the revolutionary overthrow of capital, no International arbitration tribunal, no debate on the resolution of firmaments, no &quot;democratic&quot; re-organisation of the league of HatiOns oan preserve humanity from imperialist wars.7* The Parties wishing to belong to theCommunist International must reoognise that it is necessary to have a complete and definite rupture with the reformists and with the &quot;centrist&quot; policy. ..The Communist International insists upon this rupture, absolutely and without discussion, and it must be carried out as quickly as possible...8. . ... Every Party belonging to the CommunistInternational is in duty bound to unmask relentlessly the prowess of &quot;its&quot; Imperialists in the colonies; to support, not in words but in deeds, every movement for emancipation in the - colonies; to demand the expulsion from the colonies of the Imperialists of. the Motherland; ...and to carry on among the troops of the Motherland a continuous&quot;agitation against all oppression of the colonials.9. Every Party wishing to belong to theCommunist International must carry on persistent and systematic propaganda inside the Trades &apos; Unions, the Co-operatives and other working class organisations.   Communist nuclei  must be formed, whose constant and persistent work will win the Unions to Communism...These Communist nuclei  must be completely subordinated to the general control of the Party.10.        Erery Party belonging to the Communist International is bound to fight energetically and tenaciously the yellow &quot;international&quot; of the Trades Unions founded at  Amsterdam.   On the other hand it must support with all its strength the International Union of Red Trades Unionists adhering to the Communist International.11.        The Parties desiring to belong to the Communist International are bound...to demand from every Oonraunist Parliamentary candidate the subordination of .all his activities to the real\    interests of revolutionary propaganda and agitation.12.       The whole of the periodical or other Press and all the editions should be entirely subordinated to the Central Committee of.the&apos; Party, whether the latter is legal or illegal...13.        The Parties belonging to the CommunlBt International should be formed on the principle of democratic centralisation.   During the actual period of acute civil war the Communist Party will not be able to fulfil its role unless it is organised in the most centralised way, with an iron discipline similar to military discipline, and if its central organism is furnished with wide powers, exeroising an undisputed authority, enjoying the unanimous confidence of the militants.
The Parties wishing to belong to the Communist International must support without reserve all the Soviet RepubLios in their fight against the counter-revolution.   They must unoeasingly advocate the refusal of the workers to transport munitions and arms destined for the enemies of the Soviet Republics, and to pursue, either legally or illegally, propaganda amongst the troops sent against the Soviet republics....It is necessary that the programme of the Parties affiliated to the Communist International should be Confirmed by the International Congress or by the Executive Committee. In the case of the refusal to sanction a Party by the latter, the Party has the right to appeal to the Congress of the Communist International.All the deoisions of the Communist International Congress, as well as those of the Executive Committees, are binding upon all the Parties affiliated to the Communist International. Aoting during the period of acute civil war, the Communist International must be much more centralised than was the Second International...In conformity with all that precedes, all the Parties affiliated to the Communist International must alter their names.  Every Party desiring to adhere to the Communist International must be called:   wComunistParty of........... (Section of the ThirdCommunist International).&quot;....m 3 *
