ULU ILCONTRACTS KB TBB SUPJPLY OB&apos; GOODS K SOVIET RUSSIA. Hote by the President of the Board of Trade.I ciroulate for the information of the Cabinet a Memorandum that has been prepared in my Department on Export of Goods to Soviet Russia.27th September, 1920.R* So EU

Krassin that the Russian Trade Delegation has recently entered into the following contractst-gamo of ffirnu floods, Value.Sibunion .............    parts of Maohinery  8,600and ThreadSibunion .i...........

Inquiries have been made as to whether any of these contracts include material destined for military use,&quot;Sibunion&apos;&apos; Ltd&quot; state that they have decided not to proceed with the contracts.    They deny that they were for military material and the specifications support their statement. Messrs. Brnest Beck say that their oontracts include one of  720,000 for khaki cloth.    The firm state that about half this quantity it in stock in their warehouses and *boa% half will have to be manufactured, but it would appear possible that they aro understating the proportion in stock.    It is not known whether the cloth is to be made into uniforms or not. Messrs. Womersley (a well-known Bradford house) at first re-pud iated the existenoe of any contraot with the Russian Trade Delegation, but there appear to be grounds for believing that a contract may have been made for them by a third party, and if so it would probably consist in the main of military blankets of which they are manufacturers.&quot;British Trading Centres&quot; is a one-man agency in London. It is alleged that the gentleman concerned has been trying
to plaoe contracts for khaki, but it bas not been possible up to the present to get into direct touch with him.    Further inquiries are being made.    Mr. Stern1 s contract is for parts of textile machinery.It is also loarnt from Mr. Wise that tho Russian Trade Delegation aro in negotiation with certain interests for the export of 1,000 tons of lead from this country to Russia, and it has been stated to Mr. Wiso by Ma Krassin in explanation that Russia is urgently in need of lead for electrical. building and drafting purposes *It is also understood that enquiries have been made for hoavy boots of British army type amounting to  100,000, and it is reported that orders have been placed in the Bristol district.    Endeavour is being made to obtain confirmation.An arrangement is also in process of conclusion between the Russian Trade Delegation and a group of well-known chemical manufacturers which has been formed ad hoc under the title of Anglo-Russian Drug Corporation for the supply of drugs and fine chemicals.    This group is keeping closely in touch with the Department of Overseas Trade.    They have been informed that licences can only be granted for drugssSir RofceAt Glanfield of Messrs. Glanfield and eons, B&amp;ick 1 Lane, 38, clothiers, who are well-known as manufacturers of uniforms, states that a contract for clothing was offered tf him but he is not procoeding further with the matter at present.    He says that the contract was not for khaki or other military uniforms.There may be other contracts of which the Board are unaware.The legal position is that all exports to Soviet Russia are prohibited - and licences to export are given only in respect of medicinal supplies.    The goods referred to are generally to be consigned to Reval, which is not in Russia, but it is known that they are destined for Russia.    The attorney General is bci.ib- exulted as te whether in these
circumstances exportation to Reval except under licence con-stitutes a breach of the prohibition.    If ha advises in the affirmative I suggest that the situation will be adequately met &quot;by notifying the firms that the export would be illegal unless licences are applied for and granted?    It is advisable to make a public announcement as soon as possible.In the event ol the Cabinet deciding to prevent these exports the Customs, if warned, could seize the goods, but to hold them it would be necessary to prove that they were destined for Russia.    As goods for neutral portB need not be declared until after the departuro of the ship, tho Customs could not detect these illegal exports unless they were advised to be on the watch for particular consignments. The alternatives of requiring pre-entry of goods destined for Eastern Europe, or of extending the requirement of licences to exports to all countries through which goods might be sent to Russia, would obviously entail a most undesirable inter-ference with trade and be otherwise objeotionable.If the projected Irade Agreement is made with Russia, control over the export of khaki can be retained nevertheless by excluding &quot;war material&quot; from the scope of the agreement.But when the end of the war is declared, the control will lapse except in so far as limited power is givon by the Exportation of Arms Act, 1900*in the event of His Majestyrs forces co-operating with those of some other country against Bolshevik aggression,27.9.SO./
