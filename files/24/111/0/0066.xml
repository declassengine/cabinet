BEKEBTIS DURING EMERGENCY.,memorandum by the ivjlnister of Labour.In. February last proposals for emergency measures for out-of-work pay in the event of &amp; strike of essential services were submitted by Sir Hubert horne and approved by the Cabinet. A copy of Sir Robert Horne&apos;s memorandum is attached, (a)It is proposed to apply these emergency measures as from the commencement of the miners1 strike should it occur, subject to one minor modification, namely, that ex-Service men and women who are unemployed before the commencement of the strike and entitled under their original donation policies to a higher r*-te of donation than 20s. per week or to allowances for dependent children or both, should continue to receive them.   Under the scheme previously proposed these persons in common with all other recipients of donation were to receive during the emergency a flat rate of 2os. a week.   This would mean in such cases a reduction in the rate of donation as compared with the amount which these persons were previously drawing and which apart from the emergency they would have continued to draw, and having regard to the criticisms which this would obviously evoke, I think, on consideration, that the better plan is to allow these   persons to continue at the higher rate.A summary of the proposals including the modification referred to in the previous paragraph Is attached (B).In substance the proposal applies the existing rules with regard to payment of donation and benefit to the period of emergency The modifications in these rules are such as are essential for purposes of simplification owing to the large numbers by whom/claims
claims may be made,   a flat rate of donation st 20s. a week and 15s. for women (which are the lowest rates at present operating) is fixed for the sake of simplicity in all except the special oases above referred to.It should be realised that unless some instructions to the contrary are given my Department will have no alternative but to attempt t3 psy donation and benefit under the ordinary rules and the machinery will inevitably break down within a few days. The alternative of stopping payment of donation to ex-Service men during the emergency is not one that could in my opinion be adopted, and the right to unemployment benefit is statutory.I am satisfied that the reasons which led the Cabinet to sanction the proposal last February, are equally valid to-day, end accordingly I ask ior authority to proceed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been consulted, and while not wishing in any way to pre-judge the question, feels that the matter is one which ought to come before the Cabinet for decision.I need hardly point out that detailed instructions have to be prepared and issued and an immediate decision is necessary.3J.J.

In view of the possibility of a stoppage of essential services at any time owing to a strike it is important to dofino in advance the polioy which tho Government intends to tako as regards out-of-rwork pay.2.     In the railway strike of September, 1919, it was decided to paydonation to all/non-strikers.   The rates for ox-members of H.M.Forces were to be those to which they wore entitled under the ordinary schomo but civilians wore to receive donation at a reducedflat rato of 25/- for marriod men, 15/- for single men and 12/- forwomen.   It should be remembered that at that time tho DonationScheme for civilian workors was still in force so that tho decisionmoant merely continuing during the strike the existing rights underthe schome with a modification of the weekly rates payable to civilians for tho purpose of achieving simplicity in prooedure.3.    At present the only persons entitled to Donation are ox-members&apos;of H.M. Forces and Merchant Soamon.   Civilians to the number ofabout Sf millions (i.o. those oraployod\in insured trades) areentitled to Unemployment Benefit at the rate of 11/- a wook.This is a statutory right of which the insured workors could not-   be deprived except by Aot of Parliament,   Adding these olassestogether and making some allowanoe for over-lapping the totalnumber at present oovered by donation or unemployment benefit may be put at, from&apos; 6^-. to 7 millions i.e. rather less than half the totalnumber of workpeople in the country.4.     Since it is incumbent on the Government to pay UnemploymentBenefit to insured workpeople and donation to ex-members ofH.K. Forces and Merchant Seamen the large numbers, who in the case
of a strike will have to be dealt with make it essential that the rates of donation should be simplified during the emergency period.5.    A certain amount of simplification was attempted for theperiod of the railway strike in the case of civilian workers butnot of ox-members of H.M. Forces (see Paragraph 2).   That strikofortunately endod in a week but the experience then gained make sit clear that a much greater degroe of simplification in thorates of emergency donation is imperative, and that the oomplica-tions still retained on that occasion could not have beenadhered to if the strike had continued for a longer period.The only workable scheme for payment of donation to ex-servicemen, on tho vast scale here contemplated as possiblef is thatthere should be only two rates, viz. those for men and womenrespectively (with half rates for boys and girls so.far as-they are included).   It is proposed therefore that there should be a single rate of 20/- for man and 15/- for women with halfthese rates for boys and girls between the ago of 16 and 18.Thoro would be no supplementary donation in respect of childrenbelow the age of 16.   The rates proposed would apply both tothose persons who wore on donation before the emergency and tothose who camo on afterwards.   The rates proposed are identical with those at present being paid to ex-members of H.M, Forces v/hohave exhausted the first 59 weeks of donation and to merchant seamen.   They are higher than Unemployment Benefit for tho insuredtrades but lower than the rates payable to ex-members of H.M.&apos;Forces during the first 39 vveok..6.    For administrative reasons it is necessary that the special donation should not be counted against the ordinary donation.   It is further suggested that in the case of ex-members of H.M. Forces the period of one yoar in which they may draw their first 29 weeks donation should be extended by a period equal to the duration of the emergency.
7.        In the case of Unemployment Benefit (y/hioh is fixed at the rate of ll/- a week) the amount obtainable depends on the number -of -c-on-tributlons&quot; paid and the days of benefit previously received, and if the rules were to bo strictly enforced reference to the state of the workmen1s account as shown by the records in London would in many cases be necessary before payment could be mc.de.   Even if the great numbers Involved during such a strike could be handled in this way, the absence of postal facilities would make such reference to London impossible.     It is therefore proposed that payment of benefit up to &quot;(say) four weeks should be authorised locally without reference to the records in London.This will result in a certain number of payments being made which are not due and it is suggested that the method of dealing with these payments (i.e. whether they should be charged to the Unemployment Fund   or to the Treasury) should be arranged between myself and the Treasury, after obtaining advice as to the legality of charging them to the Unemployment Fund,8.        Under the Unemployme ,,t Insurance Scheme claimants have t&quot;   . fulfil a waiting period of 6 days before their unemployment counts for benefit, and it is proposed that a similar condition should apply to applicants for donation who had not become unemployed and made claim for donation before the first day of the emergency   period, 9.        It will be essential as r lready mentioned that tlx. co-operation of employers shall be obtained and with a view to making the procedure as simple as possible it is suggested that they should be authorised to pay donation to all ex-members   of H.M.Forces who wore in their employment at the commencement of tho emergency and who can produce certificates of discharge from the Forces.   If It becomos necessary to bring the   emergency scheme Into operation before 31st March this proposal might Involve after 26th&apos; January some risk of over-paying those ex-members of II.:I.Forces who have exhausted their original 39 week of donation and the additional $ weekb recently granted.   The/numb-:, rn
numbers involving such an error, hovrovor, would bo vyry &amp;m*ll and as the checking of such over-payment would necessitate complicated machinery whioh employers would probably decline to adopt it is suggested that the small risk involved in the proposal should be run.   If the emergency scheme did not operate before 15st March employers would be told to pay only those men whose discharge papers showed that they had left the colours loss than 15 months before the commencement of the emergency and who had therefore not exhausted their donation rights.10.       The proposals in this memorandum have been agreed to by the Treasury and I should be glad to receive the early approval of the Cabinet in order that the necessary instructions may be prepared by the staff of my Department,R.S.H0RNE.6th February, 1920.
SUMMARY OF. PROPOSALS.PAYMENT OF OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT DURING&apos; STRIKE EMERGENCY.(Note; All payments will be subject to the usual conditions e.g. as to losing employment owing to a strike).A. Ex-Service men and-women and merchant seamen. (Note: These areat present as a class, though not necessarily in all Individual oases, entitled to Out-of-Work Donation.)(1) If thro&apos;n out-of-work after commenoement of strike;-Donation to be paid at a flat rate of 20s. a week to nen and 15s a week to women without allowances for dependants. (2) If unemployed before commencement of strike and entitled to Donation under original policies (i.e. 29s with allowances for children or 20s. with allowances for children) - donation under original policies to be continued till exhausted, and there-after the flat rate - f 20s. to be paid. -(3) If unemployed before commencement of strike and not entitled to donation under original policies - Donation to be at 20s. (without allowances for children) as under special extension already operative.In all these cases except those of payments- under aniginalpolicies under (2) -(&amp;)        Waiting Period will be six days;(b) the donation paid is not to count as part of the maximum number of weeks of donation to which the applicant is otherwise entitled (e.g. as part of the eight weeks of donation which may be drawn under the special extension scheme applying up to 8th November);(c) where the original donation policy valid for 12 months after demobilisation has not been exhausted,Its period of validity will be extended by a period equal to the length of unemployment during the emergency in order that its holder^ right to donation under the original policy may be preserved.b. &apos;  Civilians insured affiainst unemployment under the UnemploymentInsurance Acts, (i.e. Building, Engineering, Shipbuilding,Lietal and. Chemical trades and a few others).Benefit at the ordinary rate of 11s after a waiting period/ofk This provision for- higher rates is the only modification of the scheme previously approved ^hich allowed only 20s. in these cases.(b)
of six days to be payable.As detailed examination of the workpeople&apos;s contributions will be impracticable payment of benefit up to four ;;eeks is to be allowed, subject to&apos;prima facie evidence that the applicant is insured.   A certain number (probably not a large number) of over-payments will thus be made and are to be borne by the Treasury if they cannot be made legally chargeable to the Unemployment fund.In consequence of the lar^e numbers that would be unemployed if the strike were of any duration, it is necessary that employers should, so far as possible, pay donation and benefit to their workpeople and an invitation to employers to co-operate in this way is to be issued as soon as the strike takes place.
