Ti!.t Ooct. 11is the Piopei^jjf^Majesty^ Qovorpmoht.If- ll&apos;8&apos;minisrty  OP   FOOD.tatistical Statement for Month of August 1920.t.v:Jhe new cereal year opens with stocks of wheat (inclusive oil new farm stocks)only slightly less than a year ago; in oats the comparison is less favourable, but stocks of barley are considerably higher. Of the other principal foodstuffs, large home supplies of meat led to a further increase of refrigerated stocks, but stocks of bacon, lard, butter, and particularly sugar, were all lower as a result of smaller imports during August.The statistics of retail- food prices collected by the Ministry of Labour as on 1st September show a further increase, the percentage increase on July, 1914, rising from 161&apos;5 on 1st August to 166*9 on 1st September. There was a considerable fall in the price of potatoes, but nearly all other foodstuffs rise in price, particularly eggs, butter, and home-killed mutton, and to a less extent, bacon and home-killed beef.Table A.-Summary for August.
