If i&apos; * jH y v jThis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET. - 369THE CABINET.Memorandum submitted to the Cabinet on 16th August, 1920, by the Russian Trade Committee on the Draft Trading Agree-ment, prepared in the Board of Trade, between His Britannic, Majesty&apos;s Government and the Russian Soviet Government. ^&apos;77MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR..WitK reference to the above-mentioned memorandum, I circulate the following 0*49 observations by the War Office representatives on the Draft Trading Agreement. - 9631&apos;    W. S.C.The War Office,24th August, 1920.Preamble.The War Office was not consulted in regard to the composition of the British Note of 30th June, 1920.The following observations are therefore made now : Condition 2.The expression &quot; mutual cessation of hostilities &quot; is misleading as implying that Great Britain is engaged in hostilities against the Soviet Government. No British forces are so engaged.Condition 3.The expression &quot; cessation of propaganda &quot; requires further definition.It is, however, to be remembered that cessation of propaganda on the part of the Soviet Government does not mean cessation on the part of the 3rd Moscow International, which is not bound in any way by the proposed agreement, although its leaders are at the same time occupying executive positions in the Soviet Government.As the note of 30th June is a fait accompli, no further action in regard to it would appear possible.In view, however, of Article 7 it is considered necessary clearly to lay down the right of either party to denounce the agreement in the event of the conditions contained in the note of 30th June not being observed.Paragraph 2 of the preamble should therefore be amended by the addition of the words in italic, as follows : The aforesaid parties have accordingly entered into the following agreement, without prejudice to the view which either of them may hold as to the legal status of the other, and subject always to the right of either to denounce the said agreement in the event of the non-fulfilment of the conditions specified in the British note, dated 30th June, 1920, and accepted in the telegram from the Soviet Government, dated 7th July, 1920, with regard to the mutual cessation of hostilities and propaganda directed against the institutions or interests of the other party and the repatriation of prisoners.Article 2.The views expressed by the Admiralty and Home Office in regard to the restrictions to be placed on the landing of Russian crews in British ports, are concurred in.(B20/370)   100  8/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.   3494w
Article 3, first paragraph.The recommendations of the Home Office in regard to the procedure to be adopted in the visaing of passports is concurred in.Article 4, second paragraph.The limitation of the weight of the sealed bags should be 3 kilogrammes per week.Article 7.From the moment notice of termination is given no new trading transactions should be allowed to start.Articles 1, 2, 5, 6 should remain in operation only for so long and to such an extent as to facilitate the rapid winding-up of current transactions-for which reasonable facilities will be given.Articles 3, 4 should be liable to be terminated at short notice, say 1 week, except such portions of them as are necessary for the completion of any current transactions. But, in this case, the denunciation of these Articles (3 and 4) should not prejudice the rights of commercial representatives and official agents to receive immunity from arrest and to be accorded free egress.
