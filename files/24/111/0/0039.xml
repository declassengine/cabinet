Tchitcherin&apos;s reply to Mr. Balfpur1 s Hote of(Circulated for information).128 Nevr Bond Street, London,8th September, 1920.Mr. Kaneneff presents his compliments to theRight Honourable Arthur James Balfour, M.P., and begs toenclose herewith Mr. Tchitcherin&apos;s reply to Mr. Balfour&apos;sjremarks in his note of the 1st Scot ember.
Iff. Bal*0tt* having acknowledged tho receipt ^(jjcf our last despatch with a few words of comment, wo on our part cannot l:.t thco * pass without making some remarks,&apos;. Aft or the British Government had recognised that tho Russian Government was entitled to demand fron tho Polish Government guarantees against tho -re cur re ne-- of its wanton attack,    Mr. Balfour now nays that the Brit ioh Government does not con-oider tho limitation of tho Polish army a just condition, but one which only does not involve British active intorvontion.      Talcing note of this change in tho British Government1 s attitude, wo cannot holj3 suspecting that tho British Government is once more a victim of what has so often, unfortunately, influenced its Russian Policy, namely misinformation.It seems as if Nr. Balfour labours under tho illusion that a radical change has occurred in tho military situation as between Runsia and Poland.     &quot;that has in reality occurred is the unsuccessful result of one particular operation, which at most, moans a delay in the attainment of tho object of tho campaign.    Kr. Balfour has been completely misinformed if he ascribes more than thin to the military ovnnts, which have taken place before Warsaw.     Our relativ-1 strength with regard to Poland is the same as before;    it has even altered to-our advantage, owing to the reinforcements sent to the front.   If, therefore, members of the British Government recognised three weeks ago that Russia was entitled to apply the rights of a victor, the situation in this r&quot;sppct regains unchanged.&apos;Ve, for our part, still adhere to th&apos; attitude which wo adopted from the beginning; namely, that none of our terms has the character of an ultimatum, and that each one of them can bo discussed and examined during our negotiations with Poland.     Having a lasting peace as its object, tho Russian Government!s principal means of attaining this is&apos;the moral support and sympathy of the e;rcat working masses of other countries.   In view of the constant action of the Polish workers for the oouse of peaoe with Russia, the Russian Gov!?rnmont,and without endangering the cause of Peace, felt its&amp;af justified in supplementing the Polish Army by an armed militia
consisting of workers; while any other composition ofthis militia would nullify the limitation of tho Polish army0Mr. Balfour onoe more repeats tho insulting accusations contained in the unfortunate British communique of August 24th against, the Russian Governments action in this matter.   The original summary of the Russian terms consisting only of a few lines, anc&quot;. the final peace eondit-ions haying to oe &amp; lengthy document, the abundant material &quot;which the latter must o ontain &quot;but which naturally was not intho former is open to the same objection of having been con-concealed from the British Government, when the initial summary \ as communicated to the latter.   The Russian Government, there-fore, cannot help seeing in this objection an outcome of the same delusion, under which Kr. Balfour was labouring, concern-ing an imaginary radical change in Russian policy; which, he appears to consider, justifies the new attitude towards Russia, as expressed in the above communique.Her can we help doubting whether the British Government would have come out with the same violent opposition had the proposal been to form the civic militia from members of the propertied classes.     In fact, the British Government has given sufficient proof of its sympathies with victors imposing upon a vanquished people the strengthening of the power.of the propertied classes.    Great Britain was, for example, one of those powers which put forward as a condition of peace for the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the removal of its proletarian government; and the whole Russian policy of the British Government during the last two years has exclusively been an expression of the same tendency.   Mr, Balfour is therefore hardly justified in invoking an alleged principle of the British Government in this matter; and if he thinks that the creation of an armed workerfs militia would upset civil order, it is clear that he regards civil order as the crushing of the great working community under the Domination cf the propertied classes &quot;by sheer brute force,Kr,Balf&quot;Our
Mr.Balfour&apos;s final observation as to the supposed failure of Russia&apos;a Worker&apos;s and Peasantrs Government to procure *ioro wellboing for the poor, is in no greater measure a proof of impartiality.   The governmen    which for two years carried on the so-called &quot;economic encircle-ment&quot; of Russia, for a long time deprived the Russian people even of coal and oil, and cut it off fVc-n the richest grain-producing provinces, is hardly in a position to express astonishment thnt the Russian Government has not been able to secure to the Russian people more wellbeing than is now the fact.   The complete confidence which was so many times expressed by members of the British Government, or by their mouthpieces in the Press, 33 to the effectiveness of the Blockade in crushing the resistance of the Soviet Government, must lead to the conclusion that it is not the lack of well-being In Russia which should be an object of c-stonishnent: on the contrary, no other form of Government given similar conditions could have polled forth such power of resistance in the Russian people or could have preserved it. during the unprecedented trials to which it was subjected by the action of the Allied powers.   Under no other form of Government would it have been possible for the Russian people to hold put without fuel, without the southern grain, without foreign raw materials, without agricultural implements, and without the other machinery which Russia had always imported from ilb road.Mr.Balfour Is once nore completely misinformed if he thinks the riches of the upper class in Russia have simply been destroyed, and have not become the patrimony of the whole community; the marvels of apt which formerly adorned the palaces of princes or great financiers are now available to the whole nation, and have become a source
of delight to the great masses, who formerly were cut off from the highest joys of life.   These palaces are now palaces of the people, and the home of groat popular Institutions in which the life of the nation centres.    The luxurious dwellings of the aristocracy have &quot;been converted int$ grrt-at popular clubs, in which the working community enjoys life, listens to music, sees good plays, partlei-pates in political discussions, attends scientific lectures, or simply spends its free time in friendly intercourse. Popular theatres popular concerts, popular scientific Institutions are multiplying daily In the suburbs of the great cities, as well as In remote villages.   Special institutes of proletarian culture are Initiating the.great working masses into all the mysteries of art and science, and every human t-aleni finds generous encouragement enabling it te develop to IVa highest possibilities.   The houses ef the rich hrfve beenrgiVen to the poor, and those who formerly rtitSed in slums-now enjoy the benefits of gcrbd housing,   Technical Inventions are now utilised to promote the welfare of the great masses, and electricity appears even In -villages where primitive conditions hitherto prevailed.   Popular soup kitchens and communal feeling bring relief to the great masses in the painful conditions created by the blockade^ which under any other system would have been a complete impossibility.   The great working community of Russia has taken its fate into its own hands, in the form of the Soviet system.   Peace alone is needed in   order to enable It to develop its incalculable possibilities.   Peace is therefore our fundamental aim, and Russia1s war with Poland is only an episode in her struggle for Peace.2, 7/hltehall Gardens, S.V]. September 9tholOSO.
iR. BAIFOUR*S REPLY TO lu TCHITCH3RIH.Mr, Balfour presents his compliments to M. Kameneff ana bep-s to acknowledge the receipt of his letter of August 26th $ covering a telegraphic despatch from M. ri&apos;ehitoherin.   This deals with a great variety of topics and, among others, with tho terms of peace recently offered to Poland by the Soviet Government.On this subject Mr. Balfour desires to express his graf -disqualification that the Soviet Government &quot;renounces its demand for the creation of the Workers&apos; Militia in Poland&quot;, though, unfortunately, there are other statements made by M. Tchitcherin in connexion with these transactions which cannot be allowed to pass without some words of comment.In the first place, M. Tchitcherin is in error in supposing that the British Government ever &quot;recognized&quot; that &quot;the limitation of the Polish Army to 50,000 men was a just term of peace,&quot;   The British Government never expressed any such opinion,   what they said was that this term of peace would not be considered either by the British Government or the British people as a sufficient ground for active intervention - a view which they felt bound in honour to express clearly and at once, lest their silence should be misinterpreted by those who had to conduct peace negotiations on behalf of Poland at Minsk.The next point is even more important.   The Soviet Government are, it seems, &quot;astonished&quot; that the British Government should&apos; now disapprove&apos; of Poland being &quot;permitted   to raise a supplemenwy armed force&quot; in the shape of a &quot;civic militia.&quot;   This singular statement, which represents the establishment of the oivia militia as a concession to Poland, is evidently meant as a jest; and so far neither requires nor deserves a reply.   But it is a jest which&apos; seems intended to disguise the true character of a diplomatic transaction which certainly requires, though it has not yet re-oeived, an explanation from the Soviet Government.The facts are these.   When Parliament was about to be ad-journed, great public anxiety was felt and expressed with regardTubTfsYed in the &quot;Times&quot; of 87th August&quot;. &quot;..............................i..............................___________&apos;_______________ -6-
to the Polish situation.   Both the Government and the House of Commons wished to avoid anything in the nature of warlike opera-tiona ajjalnst Soviet Russia; but both were aorneotly desirous of maintaining fen independent Poland secure within its ethnographic frontiers.   In their communication &amp;is Majesty&apos;s Government in-quired what terms the Soviet Government, then victorious, proposed to demand; ancJ they were given an official assurance that so far as polish disarmament was concerned nothing more would be required, than the reduction of the regular army to 50,000 men, with the armaments necessary to equip not only these, but a oivio militia besides.No hint was given that the civio militia was to be seleoted from a particular class of the population, and that the choice of this class was to be imposed on the vanquished by its victorious enemy.   The fact of this concealment is now apparently admitted; and its obvious result that Parliament separated under the impression that Poland was to lose neither hor national indepen-dence nor her legitimate frontier must surely have been foreseen. That Parliament and the country were in fact deceived is indeed certain; why they were deooivec. may pe haps be conjectured, but has never been avowed.Instead of dealing with this crucial point, 11. Tohitcher^E suggests in his despatch that the objections felt by Ms Majesty&apos;s Government to the olvio militia are due to the fact that it was. to be composed of workmen.   This is an orror.   Their objections would have been just as strong if it had to be composed of millionaires.   In either case an armed force enrolled from one i class of the population to the exclusion of all the others wculd, have been imposed en the Poles, at the bidding of a foreign power\ under its protection, -and constituted according to its will.   Such a scheme, is not consistent with national independence, nor even with the permanent maintenance of civil order.Much of M. ToMtoherin&apos;s despatch is occupied with a comparison between the oonditlon of the wage-earning population in SovietRussia and In Great Britain respectively.   This is apparently basedon the fact that there are inequalities of wealth in Great Britain-7- which/
1st September 19SO.whioh in- Russia are no longer to be found.   Mr. Balfour doss not doubt the statement, though he is not prepared to discuss L. Tohitoherin?s inferences from it, which seen: quite irrelevant to the main purpose of this letter.   But spoakinf? for himself, ho may perhaps be permitted to observe that he never for a moment questioned the complete efficacy of Soviet methods for making rich men poor; it is in tho more difficult, and, in Mr. Balfour&apos;8 view, more i portent task of making poor mgn richer th failure is to be feared.
