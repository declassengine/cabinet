mG- 2 R -u A N Y     (Oontd.)NETHERLANDS.Vice Admiral Bauduin in his book published in July says that the defence of the Dutch East Indies can no longer be&apos;maintained with the present out-of-date ships.   He advocates the use of submarines to replace old men-of-war of 5 to 6,000 tons and a speed of 16 knots.   The most modern of this type, tho &quot;DE SEVEN PROVIN0I3N&quot; vdth a displacement of 6,634 tons and 16.3 knots carries only two 28 om. and four 15 cm. guns.It may be noted that and K.V are now beingadded to the Submarine Flotilla in the East Indies and that the older ships have been or are being withdrawn.I T A L Y.H.:&apos;;.S* &quot;Europa&quot; has been purchased by the &quot;Societa Anonima di Oostruzicni ed Impress Navali Andora&quot; of Genoa for  22,000*   It is stated in the Press that the Peruvian Govern-ment has ordered three submarines from GIO ANSALDO and Co.Admiral CAGNI has succeeded Admiral CUSANI VISOONTI on the Admirals&apos; ADRIATIC Committee*JUGO   island VIA.The disposal of the 12 ex Austro Hungarian T.B!s at Cattaro, which are allotted to Jivio - Slavia, is still under consideration, and as- a consequence the French can hardly evacuate  by the 1st October.BULGARIAThe Bulgarian Government are contesting certain of the Naval clauses of the Bulgarian Treaty.   They contend -(1)   That whereas Arts. 69 and 82 clearly limit the personnel of their future Army, there is no cor-r.3spending  limitation of future naval personnel, other thd.ii for police and fishery work.(2)   That Art. 83 limits their future possessions as regards police and fishery duties craft and Art. 86 precludes their owning Submarines.   There is, &apos; however, no definite statement precluding Bulgaria from owning surface men-of-war in the future.(3)   That Art. 83 paragraph 4 refers only to vessels for police and fishery duties.The above points are beini? referred to the Council of Ambassadors.RUMANIAFive Rumanian Naval Officers have now arrived in England in connection with the negotiations relative to British Naval assistance to Rumania.

5626PART   II.   GENERAL   INTELLIGENCE.PAL E:;S T I N gSir H. Samuel reports that Hussein the King of the Hedjaz has sent an appeal to the Sheikhs in Trans^-Jordania calling upon them to unite in assisting their co-religionists to throw off the yoke of- the infidels.There is no evidence as yet of any response to this appealc1,1 5 S 0 P 0 T A U I.ATho G.O.C.&quot;, Mesopotamia considers that it is important to effect the early relief of the garrison entrenched at Samawah on the Lower Euphrates, as delay in so doing is liable to cause the present disorder in that area to spread amongst the tribes of Lower Mesopotamia who are keenly watching events.Two intensive air raids were carried out on the town of Samawah, whose inhabitants are Known to be hostile; these produced a demoralizing effect on the insurgents, who deserted the town and moved to villages nine miles away,A strong column is being formed at UR a3 troops arrive from India, and it is expected that this column will shortly commence operations towards Samawah.The garrison at Kufah are not in any difficulty, and arrangements will be made to relieve them as soon as the operations along the railway to Persia are brou$at to a satisfactory conclusion.Generally speaking the tribal situation shows improvement.PERSIALauldaberus-Sum, the new Governor-General of Persian Azerbaijan, has taken energetic action in clearing up the long standing unsatisfactory situation in that Province. For a long time the town of Tabriz has been dominated by Sheikh Khiyabani at, the head of a party whose object was the separa-tion of Azerbaijan from the rest of Persia% and the late Governor-General, who was helpless against them, was obliged to return to Teheran.   Khiyabani refused to recognise the new GovernorwGeneral on his arrival^ and the latter, with the help of loyal Cossacks, attached the democrats inflicting severe casualties and capturing all their guns, rifles and ammunition. Khiyabani was shot dead on offering resistance when called upon to surrender himself to arrest.The town is now quiet and the populaoe are much pleased with the present turn of events.It is satisfactory to note that the Persian Cossacks have re-oocupied Re sat; they have been exposed to severe weather conditions without shelter and were reported to be sick and disheartened.   Their camp was twice bombed by 3. Bolshevik aeroplanes.Bolsheviks are again reported to be active at Enzelij the Corrrinder of the Cossack Division states that three vessels have reached&apos;Snzeli containing enemy reinforcements.

The latter has been refused re-entry into Groat Britain. Moscow denies that Kamenoff was implicated in the ! Jewel   deal. It is understood that negotiations involving nine millions sterling are now proceeding between the Soviet Trade Delegation and the Beardmore group.   Moscow, by W/l, has asked the Soviet Trade Union Delegation for the reasons which prompted them to proceed to Germany.)Oh the Polish front the Bolsheviks are reported to be concentrating in the Minsk area*   Trotsky is at Lidao In the district South-Test of Grodno Bolshevik attacks were beaten off by the Poles.   In Brest-Litovsls: area the Poles have forced the 2/luohewic^ South of Prujini^ and are advancing forth&quot;-Fast.   In the South, there is no change.   At Rovno the Poles took 4,0.&quot;O prisoners, 28 guns and much military materiala    Budennie is reported in the Koretz district, retiring Fast to Novgorod Volinsk.B A L T I 0,Lithuania *    The Lithuanian Government proposed to move to Vilria during the week., The Polish-Lithuanian negotia-tions for the demarcation line at Kalvariya have come to Nothing.   On 22nd September the Poles   sent a parlementaire under flag of truce to call on Lithuanians to retire behind demarcation line.   The flag of truce was fired on and the Poles attacked and occupied Sejny.The Polish demands were due to military necessity in, view of Bolshevik concentrations in the regions of Grodno and Minsk.   Also the Germans are putting interned Bolsheviks across the frontier at Virbalien, whence, to avoid having to feed them,   the Lithuanians sent them by train to Russia.SOUTH   RUSSIA.    -Holi,Government has decided to accept the Serbian offer to receive Russian refugees.   The refugees at Lemnos will be first moved as soon as Serbia is prepared, to receive then, then those at Cyprus, and finally those from Egypt.

The Confederation of Labour has approved the agreement effected by the Government, but the federation of metal workers have decided to refer a final decision to a referendum., Pending the result the men are not evacuating the works and are shewing an inclination to disobey the leaders&apos; instructions.T-U R K.....5 Y;The moral of the Nationalist army is still bad -witness the almost unopposed capture of the important town of USHAK by the Greek forces.   Political quarrels between the Nationalist leaders continueoBolshevist propaganda is having some effect on the peasantry of certain regions who anticipate that they will soon be able to seixe the lands of their richer neighbours,,Tho British occupation of LSMN03, IMBROS and TENSDOS is to continue until the ratifications of the Turkish Treaty have been deposited, when these islands pass under Greek sovereignty.ARABIAThe Indian soldiers&apos; pilgrimage to MECCA is reported to have been agreat success..
