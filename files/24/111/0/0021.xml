In view of tho great loss which will;be incurred if ships convoying Governmont meat are delayed for.lack of storage, while privato shipments obtain priority, I have indicated to tho storekeepers that if necessary a more extended use will be made of my powers of control over cold storage.   Up to tho present this action has had the desired effect and no unduo delay has taken place in the discharge of meat vessels, still, however,Tho heavy shipments which aro coming forward may cause an embarrassing situation to arise*
(7)   On August 24th and 25th Conferences were held between the Pood Controller and Dr. Hermes, the German Pood Controller, and among other things.. 3.0,000 tons of mutton and 15,000 of australian -laslan beef were offered to the German Government at prices equivalent to the wholesalo prices at which the meat is being sold in London, plus cost of freight.   With tho sanction of the Treasury it was also suggested thit long terms of credit might be given for this meat.   Smaller parcels were also offered on similar terms, but in the result   the German govern-ment refused to buy any meat.The position in Germany at the present time is that they have in stock 75,000 tons of frozen meat, bacon, corned beef etc., of which 22,500 has been allocated by the Central Govern-ment to the various municipalities for distribution.   These stocks it is anticipated will last until the end of November. In particular their stock of frozen meat is heavy a   They state that they have 12,000 tons still in the hands of tho Central Government and 12,000 tons is in course of distribution through the municipalities.   Their total cold storage capacity&apos;for meat is 20,000 to 25,000 tons and they are short of insulated waggons for transporting the meat.   In addition, Foot &amp; Mouth Disease has broken out in Bavaria and elsewhere with the consequence that a great number of home stock have to be killed.   The &quot;German Government have therefore decided not to purchase, frozen meat themselves and have prohibited the Import for the time being but their decision is to be re-considered in a month!s time,taken   &apos;&apos;Occasion was/to point out to the German delegates that the policy of prohibiting the import of cheap mutton while intelli-gible from the purely commercial view of the German Ministry of Pood (who wish first to dispose of thalrhigher-priced stocks) conflicted with the general view of the German Government as to the under-feeding of the population and the necessity of making more abundant and cheaper supplies available for them.Negotiations have been in  progress for some time past with merchants in London, with,a view to the purchase by them, on behalf of the Berlin Municipality, of 6,000 tons of mutton, but tho bargain was not completed and it seems probable that this failure was due to the cttitude of the German Government.   If, and when, they decide to allow private import it is hoped to be able to re-open this and similar negotiations, and it is antioi-pated that there will be a ready market in Germany for Australasian beef.Ministry of Pood, W, MITCHELL-TH0MSON.,1st September 1920, . .
