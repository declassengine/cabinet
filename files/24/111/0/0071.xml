[This Boca, the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government]Printed for the use of the Cabinet,  September 1920.!,SECRE3VyTHE . CABINET.THE EGYPTIAN PROPOSALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. *I AM not in the least surprised by the criticisms of the Secretary of State for War in O.P.-1803. Indeed, the wonder is that such criticisms have not been more numerous. I was quite prepared for an outcry in the press. But, contrary to my expectation, even the &quot; Jingo&quot; press has taken the suggestion of Egyptian &quot; independence &quot; very quietly. I have seen a great deal of favourable comment some of it certainly from people whose approval makes me wince and very little comment that was distinctly unfavourable. I have, however, had a few disapproving private letters. One of these, conceived &quot;rather in sorrow than in anger,&quot; is from an anonymous correspondent, who concludes with the words : &quot; I fear,, my Lord, you are getting old.&quot;This is unfortunately true. But I think that even in my hey-day I should have regarded the proposed concessions to Egyptian Nationalism as just and politic, and as calculated to strengthen and not to weaken our Imperial position.On the face of them, it is true, the proposals look like a step backward. And in a sense they really are a step backward, but to a more secure position than that which we now occupy. In itself the acknowledgment of Egyptian &quot; independence &quot; is nothing new. We have declared, not once but scores of times during the last forty years, that we had no intention of appropriating Egypt. Mr. Churchill, indeed, regards Egypt as having - been &quot; definitely incorporated in the British Empire.&quot; I doubt whether that is correct. Presumably he is referring to our proclamation of a protectorate over Egypt in .1914. The proclamation of a protectorate over a foreign country may mean much or little, but it is certainly not equivalent to annexation. Moreover, at the very time when we proclaimed the protectorate we went out of our way to represent our action as intended to defend Egypt against dangers threatening her independence ! And we at the same time raised the status of the ruler of Egypt from that of &quot; Khedive,&quot; the vassal of Turkey, to that of &quot; Sultan,&quot; the title of his former &quot; overlord &quot; ! Whatever may have been the effect of these curious and somewhat contradictory acts and declarations, which have been very differently interpreted by us and the Egyptians, it is certainly difficult to contend that they constituted an incorporation of Egypt in the British Empire.My own conviction is that it is totally impossible for any human being, however ingenious, to make out what the political -status of Egypt at the present moment actually is. The object of the proposals now under discussion is to define that status for the future, and at the same time to give to such rights as Great Britain may hereafter possess in Egypt an unquestionable legal basis in the deliberate consent of the Egyptian people. These rights are to be conferred upon Great Britain by a Treaty made with the Sultan of Egypt and confirmed by a National Assembly.At present we are in fact absolute masters of Egypt. But every act of authority which we exercise is liable to be challenged, and is in fact challenged, by Egyptian public opinion as a usurpation of powers to which we have no right. We are, in the eyes of the Egyptians, their rulers de facto, but not de jure. This will, in my opinion, prove in the long run to be an intolerable position. Sooner or later, and the sooner the better, we must settle the question of the status of Egypt and of our own position in that country, and there are only two ways of really settling it. One is to annex Egypt and thus definitely ^incorporate it in the British Empire.&quot; The other is to gratify the constant and ever-increasing desire of the Egyptians to be recognised as an independent nation a desire which we have done so much to encourage and to make the best bargain we can with them on that basis.If we can make a sufficiently good bargain, the latter course has enormous advantages. That we can maintain our position in Egypt in the teeth of Egyptian opposition, is in my opinion not doubtful.   But we shall have to pay a very heavy[4340] -B
price. I am not thinking merely, or mainly, of the cost of the Army of Occupation, which would have in that case to be maintained, for an indefinite period, at something like its present strength. More serious still is the prospect of the difficulties which the permanent hostility of the Egyptian intelligentsia will create for us both in Egypt itself and throughout the world. In Egypt itself tbat hostility threatens to paralyse the administration. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get Egyptians of any standing to take office as Ministers or high officials. The middle and lower ranks of the bureaucracy and the Egyptian officers of the army are permeated with the spirit of repugnance to British control. This spirit may not again manifest itself in widespread strikes as it did last year, though the recurrence of such strikes is by no means improbable. But it is evident that, with the whole native Civil Service permanently disaffected, the amount of grit in the administrative machine is bound to make it work very badly, and the blame for its failure will be thrown upon the British chiefs. For the same reasons we can no longer rely on the army, or at any rate on that portion of it which is composed of, and largely officered by, native Egyptians. Nor does the trouble end here. What is to happen in future about legislation ? We cannot go on indefinitely legislating by proclamations under martial law. But it would be impossible to devise any form of legislative assembly, having even the appearance of a representative character, which would not at once begin to agitate for &quot; independence.&quot; Very probably it would reject every measure proposed to it, and we should have to fall back on legislation by Sultanic Decrees. The Nationalist movement would go on gathering force, and the agitation against Great Britain would be carried on all over Europe and America by Nationalist emissaries. -Owing to the spread of education, the number of Egyptians capable of carrying on such a campaign effectively is constantly increasing, and so, thanks to the great prosperity of the country, are the funds available for their support, which will be freely lavished in the future, as they are to-day, by ambitious &quot;patriots&quot; who have more money than they know what to do with. ZaghlouTs subscription of  5,000 to the &quot; Herald,&quot; given, I may say, before we entered into discussions with him, is an illustration of what we should have to expect.- Now all this may have to be faced, if there is in fact no other way of securing.the essential and permanent interests of Great Britain in Egypt except direct British control of the whole administration. What are those.interests? Why did we.ever occupy Egypt at all? We occupied it, very reluctantly in the first instance, in order to prevent a country which, owing to its geographical position, is of special importance to us as forming a vital link in our communications with&apos;the East from falling into other and possibly hostile hands. Egypt being unable to stand on her own legs, and European interests in Egypt being so great and influential that the country could not be allowed to remain in chaos, we had no choice but to restore order there, or else to allow some other Great Power to restore it and thereby to place itself right athwart our main road to our Eastern Empire. The security .A our communications with India, and other parts of the Empire beyond India, was the supreme object which led to our inter-vention. And certainly that object is more-vital to us than ever to-day, since Egypt is now not only the road to our Eastern Empire, but has also become the road to the new territories under the British flag, which stretch in an unbroken chain from the southern confines of Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope. It is truly the nodal point of our whole Imperial system.- ... . ^  .. .\ .....But is it therefore necessary that we should own it? Is it not sufficient, if we have a firm foothold there ? The question is, whether we cannot retain such a foothold without - antagonising the whole of the educated and semi-educated classes of the Egyptian people by-keeping them in a subjection, which they detest and will,.I am convinced, constantly kick against. In my opinion it is not impossible that we should retain a position-in Egypt sufficient for all our own purposes without incurring such animosity, if we retain it by their consent, as- friends and allies, not by the undisguised use of our superior power, as their masters. On that, footing, I believe a great number of them will evenjj welcome our presence, and the rest will not greatly mind it. Even now it is not so much the presence of British troops which excites the hostility of the Egyptians. It is our &quot; administrative occupation &quot; of the country,, our interference with all their domestic affairs. - Whatever dislike they feel for our army ;is due to the fact that it is an &quot; Army of - Occupation;&quot; intended in their eyes to keep them in subjection. As a force stationed in their country, not to dominate them, but to secure objects, of our own, extraneous to Egypt, while available, in case of need, for the defence of Egypt against foreign aggression, it will appear to them in a quite different light.
All intelligent Egyptians recognise the special interest we have in safeguarding our communications with the East. Even Zaghloul was ready to admit our right to safeguard the Suez Canal. But in our discussions I think we convinced him, as we certainly convinced most of his associates, that even the Canal was not everything, but that in these days Egypt was also very important to us as a station for the Air Force and a centre of wireless telegraphy. For this and other reasons we substituted the wider formula, the &quot; defence of Imperial communications,&quot; for any special reference to the Canal, as we were anxious to emphasise the fact that the Canal was not our only strategic interest in Egypt.This point is of importance, as it meets the objections to the proposed agreement raised, and very naturally raised, by Field-Marshal Wilson and by Air-Marshal Trenchard in their appendices to Mr. Churchill&apos;s Memorandum. I entirely agree with Sir Henry Wilsons description of Egypt as the &quot; Clapham Junction&quot; of Imperial communications. But it is a mistake to think that this point of view was left out of consideration by myself or by my colleagues of the Mission, or that it was not made clear to the Egyptians. It is true that, in some of the statements which have appeared in the press, it was alleged that we had agreed to the British force, which was to be kept in Egypt, being stationed at Kantara, or, at any rate, &quot; on the banks of the Canal,&quot; and to its being limited to &quot; about 3,000 men.&quot; As a matter of fact, the Egyptians never even attempted to suggest any limit to the number of this force. They did, at the outset, wish us to say that it should be kept &quot; in the Canal zone,&quot; but this, for the reasons just given, we absolutely rejected, and they did not attempt to press the point. In the Memorandum recording the results of our conversations, as finally drafted, the question, where the British force in Egypt was to be stationed, was deliberately left open to be settled in the Treaty and the strength of the force was not referred to at all. The statements that it was to be a &quot;small British garrison&quot; of &quot;about 3,000 men&quot; and &quot;in the Canal .zone&quot; are unauthorised glosses, and the Mission never agreed to anything of the kind. Obviously, if we ever get to the point of drawing up a Treaty, we must take care to exclude any provision limiting the numbers of the British &quot; military force,&quot; which we must remain free to determine according to the varying exigencies of our Imperial strategy, while the question, where we should keep it, will have to be carefully considered in relation to all that it may have to defend, and with special reference to the protection of our aerial communications.These are not matters, on which personally I foresee any great difficulty with the Egyptians, as long as we base our demands on our own Imperial needs and avoid the appearance of &quot;garrisoning&quot; Egypt. It is the idea, that we keep our army to buttress our &quot; administrative occupation,&quot; which offends Egyptian amour-propre, and which would certainly be inconsistent with the basic conception of the future relations between Great Britain and Egypt as an &quot;independent&quot; State.It is true, that the &quot; administrative occupation,&quot; to which the Egyptians so greatly object, has been a great blessing to their country. Without taking over, at any rate for a time, the control of her internal affairs, we could never have raised Egypt from bankruptcy to her present condition of great material prosperity or put an end to the gross abuses, the cruelty, the injustice and the corruption, which prevailed under the old native administration. And, of course, there is a danger, and a serious danger, that, with the withdrawal of British control, these abuses will, to some extent, revive. But it would be taking too mean a view of the effect of nearly forty years of British-direction and example to imagine that Egypt could ever relapse into the state in which we found her. We have set up a wholly new standard of administration, and, though the mass of the people are still very backward more than 90 per cent, quite illiterate and living in primitive conditions, it would nevertheless be impossible for any native Government to apply the methods of the past. All Egyptians have learned something of what civilised government means, while the number of them who are more or less fitted to administer the country on modern lines has enormously increased, as have the material resources necessary for the maintenance of an up to date administration.No doubt the native intelligentsia are not as capable as they think themselves of practising the new methods which we have taught them. But the great change which our presence has wrought in their circumstances, their character and their outlook makes it absolutely necessary to give them more scope for their increased manliness and, no doubt, excessive ambition. They will never again be content to be the mere servants of any master, native or foreign, and like everybody else they are at the moment somewhat intoxicated with the new craze for &quot; self-determination.&quot;[4340]   . C
. It is unquestionably a bold experiment to leave them to devise their own constitution and run the country themselves with so few restrictions as are contemplated under the proposed arrangement. The experiment may well be a failure, but it is not so certain to be a failure as any half-measures would be. For, with any limited system of self-government, we should have the whole body of Egyptian &quot; Nationalists &quot;  that is to say, practically all the educated and semi-educated natives united not to try and work the new institutions, but to make them unworkable, with the object of getting something more.Even if our more liberal plan is adopted, there will, at any rate at the outset, be a party clamouring for still larger concessions and wishing to get rid of us altogether. But as against these extremists we shall have, as indeed I believe we already have, the saner elements of Egyptian &quot; Nationalism &quot; on our side. The next few weeks, or months, will show whether these saner elements are also the stronger. If they are, the great experiment can be tried with good hope of success. If they are not, the experiment will not be made.   Certainly I should be the last to recommend it.When I speak of the saner elements of Egyptian Nationalism I am thinking of those influential men and I believe they are the majority---who are perfectly well aware that Egypt cannot get on without British help, that a large number of the present British officials are indispensable to the administration of the country, and that Egypt cannot hope to retain the services of these men except on fairly lucrative and entirely honourable terms. They may think the number of British officials excessive, as indeed it is, and they resent having them imposed upon them, whether they feel that they want them or not. They desire that the British officials should be really, as they always have been nominally, Egyptian civil servants, not the masters of their nominal chiefs. In my own opinion I may be quite wrong, but that has been the dominant consideration in my mind we have now reached a stage, at which British influence in the conduct of the administration will be strengthened, and not weakened, if we frankly accept this position. On no other condition will cordial co-operation between British and native officials be possible in future. The present system means constantly-increasing friction. But once remove the main cause of that friction the feeling of the Egyptians that the British are there as their masters and I believe that native Ministers will continue to lean often, indeed, to lean too heavily  upon the British members of their staffs. It is true that the latter will no longer be in a position to dictate, but will have to rely upon their personal qualities to carry the day by influence and persuasion. But that is how the best of them have always worked in the past. The Egyptians are, as a rule, very quick to recognise ability in men of any foreign race which they respect, and ready to be guided by it, especially if it is combined with tact and good manners.If we had only to consider ourselves and the Egyptians, I should have very little anxiety about the settlement now proposed. I believe it could be effected with comparative ease, that it would be to the advantage of both parties and that it would work, not indeed perfectly, but much better than the present system. The blessed word &quot;independence&quot; will get us round many awkward corners just as the unfor-unfortunate word &quot; Protectorate &quot; would make even Paradise unattractive to the Egyptians.The difficulties that I foresee lie in a different direction, le., the attitude of the Foreign Powers-twelve in number who have Capitulatory Rights in Egypt. It is essential to the success of the proposed settlement that we should be in a position to exclude foreign interference in the internal affairs of Egypt. On the other hand, there are great and permanent foreign interests in that country which we are bound to recognise, and the inevitable necessity of providing safeguards for those interests, of guaranteeing to the European communities the same security of life and property as they enjoy to-day, will always involve some infringement of the &quot; complete indepen-dence&quot; of Egypt. What we must be prepared for is that the foreign Powers specially interested in Egypt may be alarmed, or pretend to be alarmed, at the degree of &quot;independence&quot; which we propose to accord, and on that ground may refuse to abandon the rights which- they now have under the Capitulations. But unless these foreign Powers will abandon those rights, it is impossible for us to relax our control, for in that case we should not really be helping Egypt on the road to &quot; independence,&quot; but, on the contrary, be giving her a number of masters instead of one. This would be reactionary from the Egyptian point of view and fatal to our own position. Therefore it is essential that we should be able to show that, under the proposed new system, all legitimate foreign interests will be as safe as they are to-day.As a matter of fact, the proposed arrangements do safeguard all legitimate foreign interests, though it does not follow that all the foreign Powers concerned will
admit it. The line which they may take indeed, which some of them are already taking is this : &quot; We were prepared to give up our rights under the Capitulations, if Egypt was a British Protectorate. But now that you say she is to be &apos; independent&apos;, we must reconsider the position.&quot; To that contention we have a good answer, but it is not quite a simple one. The Capitulations have two aspects they have a good and an evil side. In so far as they provide security for the lives and&apos;property of foreigners, they are beneficent. But in giving to the subjects of the Capitulary Powers a position of special privilege, in which they are exempt from taxation and in many other respects not amenable to laws applying to all other inhabitants of the country, the Capitulations are unjust to Egypt and a bar to her progress. It is only these latter abuses which will disappear with the abandonment of the Capitulations. Their beneficent effects will be preserved by the proposed treaty between Great Britain and Egypt. Under that treaty, cases in which foreigners are interested will still be dealt with by courts in which European judges preponderate. Laws which cannot now be made applicable to foreigners without foreign consent will still require the consent of the British High Commissioner. And the administration of all laws, in so far as they affect foreigners, will be under the supervision of a British official.Legitimate foreign interests will thus be amply safeguarded. Indeed, the effect of the proposed arrangement is to emphasise, rather than to diminish, the responsi-bility of Great Britain for the protection of foreign rights. As far as the foreigner is concerned, the Protectorate is completely maintained in substance, if not in name.The answer is sound, but it may take some time and a good deal of negotiation to get it accepted.   The danger is, that the objections raised by some foreign Powers may not be bond fide objections, but mere pretexts for embarrassing us in our attempt to come to a settlement with the Egyptians.    But here again, as it seems to me, we may reckon on having the better elements of Egyptian Nationalism on our side.    While  the  fight was  at  its hottest,  and   all  Nationalists  were united in hostility to British policy, it was the fashion for them to say that they ilid not mind the maintenance of the Capitulations if only they could get rid of our Occupation.   And the Extremists may continue to take that line, absurd as it is, for nothing could be more contradictory than to scream for &quot; complete independence &quot; and at the same time be willing to accept a system, under which the Egyptian Government cannot perform, the most common-place and every-day acts of administration without the consent of a dozen foreign Powers.   But, while this irrational attitude may still be maintained by some of the Nationalists, it is clear that the moderate section are now disposed to take a different line, and that, in view of the large concessions which we are ourselves prepared to make, they recognise the reasonableness of our claim to retain such a measure of control as will enable us to give to foreign Powers the assurances they may justly demand in exchange for the abandonment of their capitulary rights.   The Moderates, like Adly Pasha, fully realise that under the proposed arrangements the balance of advantage will be on the side of Egyptian independence.  Therefore in this, as in other respects, the really important question is whether the Moderates can carry the day in their attempt to conquer Nationalist opinion.   The course of events in Egypt will shortly show us whether they can or not, and the answer to that question will, as it seems to me, be decisive as to the feasibility of the proposed settlement.M.September 16, 1920.
