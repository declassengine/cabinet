ABH&apos;o&apos;Ri-tAr; tIajtsport costs.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate herewith two notes by sir Ha.rd.nian Lever in regard to the incidence of abnormal transport costs under the Ministry of Food Emergency Schemes together with my minute to Sir Hardman thereon.(initialled)   A.treasury, s.W.13th September, 1920.
Mr. Chamberlain.Ministry of FoodJSmergenoy Sohernes * Incidence of Abnormal Transport, Costs.The various schemes prepared by the Ministry of Pood for the distribution of foodstuffs during an emergency provide for the Ministry undertaking transport by road and water in the event of rail transport breaking dov/n.    Tho Finanoo Sub-Committee has. had these schemes under examination s inoe the Railway Strike and took exception to the proposal that abnormal transport costs should be borne by the Exchequer and not passed on to tho trade.     In the case of some foodstuffs, e*g. Margarine, the Ministry of Food arranged as a result of criticism from the Finance Sub-Committee that the cost of abnormal transport should bo borne by the trade, and they were prepared to pass on these abnormal costs in the case&apos; of all uncontrolled foods.     In the case of controlled foods, they represented that it would be both impolitic and impraoticable to make the trade bear the additional oosts.Tho whole question was referred to the Supply and Transport Committee, who decided on the 15th January, after considerable debate, that no steps should be taken to pass the costs on in the case of either controlled&apos; or uncontrolled foods, but that the subjeot should bo reviewed as the Strike progressed.As a result of this decision the Ministry of Food are revising those sohemes in which they had proposed to make the trade boar abnormal costs of transport.     In tho case of the London Milk Scheme alone this will involve a charge to the Exohequor of between  10,000 and- 15;000 a day.  -In view of the fact that the decision of the Supply and Transport Committee was arrived at after considerable difference , of opinion and in the absence of a Treasury Minister, I submit the/
the matter for your1 information:(Sd.)   S. HARDMAW LEVER,9th September, 1920.Tr easur y chambe r s,Whitehall,- S.w,i.SIR H. L?.VKR.-       1 jI think the decision is wrong,.     Please ask thatthe matter be discussed again find represent my very strong objections.     The business of Government is to do its best tomaintain supplies but not to subsidise them,,If the Committee will not accept this view, I must.ask for e Cabinet decision,(Sd,) A TTSTEN CHAMBERLAIN . j10/9MR. CHAMBERLAIN. jAttached is a copy of a minute T have sent to Sir E-. Geddes in the country.I think you should know that there is little hope of the Cabinet Supply and Transport Committee changing its opinion.    At the meeting on 15th January, I represented strongly the view expressed in your minute of 10th instant, but received no practical support from members of the Committee, with the exception of the Minister of Shipping,    The other Ministers present were the Minister of Transport, Pood Controller, Minister of Labour (Sir R. Home), Secretary of State for ,;!ar, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Secretary for Scotland aI understand you are returning to town on Wednesday &apos; but you may think it desirable, in view of the urgency of thematter
matter* to take steps in the meantime-(Sd.)   S. HARDMAN LEVER.11th September. 1920.Sir      Geddes.Supply and, Transport Committee. .   Ministry of Food : Emergency Schemes.I transmit herewith a copy of my submission to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, dated 9th instant, with his minute of the 10th.&apos;The Ministry of Food are of course pressing forward tbe completion of their schemes, and a decision on the ques-tion is therefore required urgently?The same question of principle arises in ths case of the measures contemplated by the Coal Mines Departments(Sd.)
