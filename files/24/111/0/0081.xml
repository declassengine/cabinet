I -I    *.......N (jgS DOC MEN T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)i[FIDSNT IALp--------- CABINET.p, 1879a *THE COAL SITUATION.Reply from Mr*Smillie and Mr. Hodges to letter from Mr. Lloyd George, (see CP. 1379).September 23rd* 1920.Dear Mr. Prime Minister,Your letter of ovon date delivered by band was duly placed before our Executive Committee to-day.We thank you for the additional information and for tho explanatory comment contained therein.Our Committee fully understood, however, from their interviews both with yourself and Sir Robert Home, the nature of your proposals for the future regulation of wages in our industry.   Wo must state, however, that the creation of a scheme for the permanent regulation of wages is a question of such magnitude as demands much thought and attention.   Many meetings of the interests concerned would be necessary and the consent of our membership secured before any scheme could be adopted^   Our Executive repeat their assurance to the Government that when the present wage claim is disposed of, they will be prepared to under-take an enquiry into the whole wage system prevailing in the industry with the view of putting it upon a modern basis which will have received the approval of tho men as a whole.Yours faithfully, (Signed) R, SMILLIE P. HODGES.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.--, 2Srd* September, 1920.1
