PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.As far as industrial disputes are concerned the situation is becoming more serious. The Triple Alliance have given moral support to the miners&apos; demands. They have not, however, committed themselves unconditionally to active support, but at their meeting on the 1st September decided to authorise the sub-committee of the Alliance to remain in continuous session with power to add to their number. The Executive Council of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce have passed a resolution calling upon the Government to refuse entirely to entertain the miners&apos; demands, in view of the economic situation of the country. The secretary of the National Union of Manufacturers (Incorp.) has stated that a Large number of firms intend to close down their works immediately on the declaration of a strike, in order to conserve their present stocks of coal.Strong efforts are being made to secure a settlement of the crisis in the engineering trade before the lock-out notices take effect on the- 4th September. It is understood that the Electrical Trades Union may take part in the meeting between the other unions affected and the employers on the 2nd September. Various important groups of workers in other trades, as, for example, pottery workers, commercial road transport workers and canal men, are pressing for increases of wages.On the political side the Council of Action remain in being, but&quot; no important develop-ments have taken place in their policy or proceedings. The annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress takes place at Portsmouth on the 6th September, when the scheme for the substitution of a General Council in place of the existing Parliamentary Committee will come up for decision.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 20th August was 139,024, made up of 138,405 lodged by men and 619 by women. On the 13th August there were 135,439 policies current, 134,808 for men and 631 for women. f;.On the 20th August, 78,902 unemployment books, 55,108 for males and 23,794 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Compared with the previous week, when there were 54,693 books lodged by males and 23,455 by females, the total increase is 754. /The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 316.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Labour anal Russia. During the earlier part of the week the National Council of Action made a definite attempt to intervene in diplomatic negotiations over the Busso-Polish questions. On the 26th August Mr. W. Adamson, M.P., chairman of the Council, had a consultation with MM. Kamenef! and Krassin. The Council then met and decided to send the following telegram to the Prime Minister, the Lord President cf the Council, and M. Kameneff : &quot; The Council of Action, having urged, the Russian Government to withdraw the one declared outstanding point in their terms to Poland objected to by the British Government, notes with satis-faction the Soviet Government^ decision, which in the Councils opinion removes all difficulties to a Russo-Polish peace. The Council now urges the British Government to publish the full terms upon which they will make peace with Russia and also urges the Russian Government to do the same.&quot;
(b 16413)2 S2On the 30fch August the Council published a report, which it instructed all local councils to discuss immediately. The report, after referring to the action taken above, states that it may still be necessary to prevent a continuation of open or disguised warfare against Soviet Russia, and that the call for action may be issued at any moment. Exhaustive inquiries have been made, and abundant information accumulated, regarding the production and movement of all kinds of war material. The manufacture and transport of both, munitions and raw material must be stopped when the necessity for action comes. The report concludes by calling upon the workers to hold themselves *in readiness for any call to action which may be made.An interesting side-light on the attitude of Labour towards the manufacture of war material, and the part which the National Council of Action are expected to play in any developments on the matter, is revealed by the resolutions passed at a meeting of officials of the Northamptonshire branches of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives. Inquiries had been made in view of the recent statements that boots were being manu-factured in various parts of the country for Poland and other belligerent nations. The meeting passed a resolution recording the opinion that the Army boots being made at certain factories were destined for the Polish Government, and asking the union executive council to take immediate action in conjunction with the National Council of Action. A second resolution requested the National Council of Action to ask immediately for information as to the destination of the boots, and, in the event of this information not being forthcoming or satisfactory, asked the Council of Action to advise the union executive council what line of action they should pursue.There is little to add to the account which appeared last week on the movement of Labour opinion with reference to the functions of the Council of Action. Branch meetings of the National Union of Railway men,-at West Calder and Kirknewton, have passed resolutions disapproving of the action of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Cramp in associating themselves with the Council. Mr. T. Mallalieu, secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Felt Hatters and president of the General Federation of Trade Unions, while admitting that the formation of the Council may have exercised a useful influence on the Government with regard to their Polish policy, has expressed the view that it was ultra vires for the various Labour leaders concerned to dictate policy to the Government before they had consulted with the organised Labour movement. He fears that there may be some intention of making the Council a permanent body with full powers of dictatorship, a course which, he anticipates, would meet with the hostility of the trade union movement. Justice, the organ of the Social Democratic Federation, in its issue of the 26th August, declares that it is at least unwise that councils of action without any genuine democratic basis should remain in being, now that the danger of war has been averted. The Cotton Factory Times for the 27th August criticises the National Labour Conference of the 13th August as unrepresentative of the trade union rank and file, and accuses the Council of Action of usurping the authority of the unions.The organisation of local machinery, however, is stiH &quot;proceeding. As an instance of the intended working of local councils of action the machinery set up at Sheffield may be noted, a report on which was endorsed by the Sheffield Federated Trades and Labour Council on the 24th August. At the meeting of this body it was explained that the Sheffield Council of Action had appointed a Supply and Transport Committee, a Strike Committee and a Publicity and Information Committee. In the event of a national strike being called as a protest against any future war, the first committee would arrange for the feeding of the people, the second would co-ordinate local strike arrangements, and the third would report to a National Council of Action all information concerning the manu-facture of war material, and keep the public informed of the progress of events. The Council would be financed by the Trades and Labour Council. Mrs. Wilkinson, chair-man of the Sheffield Council of Action, said that so far the Labour&quot; movement had lacked effective machinery for dealing with any crisis arising in connection with foreign policy. Ordinary political methods were of no avail against secret diplomacy. The National Council wished to have a control over foreign policy and, to do that, must have effective machinery throughout the country. She stated that the Council would be instituted as a permanent body.The final report of the British Labour Delegation to Russia has been issued. The report is signed by Mr. Ben Turner, Mrs. Snowden, Mr. Tom Shaw and Mr. Robert Williams, representing the Labour Party, Miss M. Bondfield, Mr. A. A. Purcell and Mr. H. Skinner, representing the Trades Union Congress, and Mr. C. R. Buxton and Mr. L. Hayden Guest, joint secretaries.  The report has been endorsed by Mr. H. C. Wallheacl
4.9.90.312and Mr. Clifford Allen, who formed an independent delegation to Russia on behalf of the Independent Labour Party. After dealing with the present general conditions in Russia, the report concludes that both the economic collapse and the measures for the restriction of freedom are due at least as much to the strain of continual warfare as to the revolution itself, and that the responsibility for the conditions resulting from, foreign interference rests, not upon the Soviet Government, but upon the capitalist governments of other countries, including our own.Labour and ireland,nd.-^he position in Belfast is under consideration by several trade unions. Members of the executive committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners are understood to have arriveel in Belfast on the 25th August to discuss the situation with the directors of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Ltd., and Messrs. Workman, Clark &amp; Co., Ltd. It is reported that two members of the executive com-mittee of the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners accompanied them to take part in the proceedings. A mass meeting of the members of both these unions in Belfast was to have been held on the 26th August to hear the report of the deputation. The meeting was, however, proclaimed by the competent military authority under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, in view of the situation in the city.It is also stated that a deputation representing the Scottish textile trade unions have left for Belfast to inquire into the position of the textile workers in the city who have been thrown out of employment by recent developments. The attitude of the executive committee of the Scottish Council of Textile Trade Unions to these textile workers in Belfast has already been noted. *The attitude of the Government towards the Lord Mayor of Cork has been the subject of condemnatory resolutions by various Labour bodies. On the 30th August Mr. W. Adam-son, M.P., and Mr. H. P. Lindsay, the chairman and the secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., and Mr. C. W. Bowerman, M.P., the chairman and secretary of the Parliamentary Commitee of the Trades Union Congress, Mr. A. G. Cameron, and Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., the chairman and the secretary of the Labour Party, sent a message to the Prime Minister asking in the name of organised labour that the Governments decision to allow the Lord Mayor of Cork to die be re-considered.Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. Following on the demon-stration strike of the 23rd August, the Scottish Labour Housing Association have decided to convene a conference in Glasgow on the 2nd October, to secure authority for the execu-tive of the Association, and the Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress to call a general stoppage of work, if they deem it necessary, in order to effect the withdrawal of the rent increases. It is understood that a similar conference will take place in Newcastle, and that the local labour organisations in some districts of England and Wales have been circularised with a view to their sharing in the movement.It is reported that payments of rents imGlasgow on the 30th August, on which date the Act came into operation, were practically normal, most tenants paying the full amounts demanded without demur.Employment Exchanges. The Preston Chamber of Commerce have prepared a report of their investigation into the working and administration of Employment Exchanges. In this report the opinion is expressed that the Exchanges have done, and are doing, useful work, but at an expense too great compared with the practical results obtained. The investigating committee therefore suggest a thorough re-organisation. They recommend that the statistical work of the Exchanges be reduced to the utmost, and that the staffs concentrate on dealing with unemployment. They also recommend that, for local prescribed areas, first-class local workmen, who have held positions such as foremen in large works, and who are conversant with most kinds of labour in such areas, should be employed to interview men seeking employment. The committee consider it essential that, before workmen are offered work in another district, it should be ascertained whether there are suitable men out of work in that district, to whom the work should first be offered. They believe that, if this suggestion could be generally adopted, much annoyance to employers and unrest among workpeople would be avoided.Co-operative Union. The Central Board met in Manchester on the 30th August. It was decided that the question of active association with the councils of action should be left to the discretion of the local co-operative societies. The question of policy with regard to intervention in Russia was referred to the forthcoming special conference at Preston. A resolution was carried &quot; deploring the failure of the Government either to protect co-opera-
31319.20.five creameries in Ireland, or bring to justice those responsible for their destruction,&quot; and demanding protection for the remaining creameries, with compensation for those already destroyed.BriclcmaJcing Industry. The adoption of the recommendations of the Railway Rates Advisory Committee by the Ministry of Transport has brought about a serious situation in the brick trade. The Scottish Employers&apos; Council for the Clay Industries consider that drastic alterations in rates have been made without the requisite con-sultation with the trades affected, and threaten to close down all brickworks in Scotland on the 1st September, pending reconsideration of their case by the Minister of Transport.Cornish Tin Mines. It is reported that at the meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the Tin Mining Industry at Camborne, on the 27tli August, a resolution was put forward urging that, as the Government have refused, to render any financial assistance to the industry on its present basis of- management^ they should be asked to take over all the Cornish mines, nationalise all the minerals, and set up a Central Management Board, half consisting of the present mine managers and the other of tin miners and surface workers. The proposal emanated from the Labour members of the Council. It is under-stood that the Council decided to refer the question to a future meeting.Housing. For a statement of the Government^ fresh proposals for increasing the supply of building labour, see page 325 below.Industrial and Other Organisations.General Union of Textile Workers. The half-yearly delegate meeting of this union was held at Stroud on the 28th August. Mr. Ben Turner, in his presidential address, reported on the progress of the negotiations for the amalgamation of unions in the woollen industry. He hoped that by the end of the year five unions will have been merged, making one union of textile workers, including dyers and finishers, with a membership of 150,000, and that some agreement will be reached whereby the members of general workers&apos; unions engaged in the textile trades will be allowed to join the textile union.Municipal Employees&apos; Association.- This association will hold their annual conference at Newcastle on the 13th and 14th September. Among the resolutions for discussion is one instructing the national executive to press for the introduction of the principle of &quot; workers&apos; control&quot; in all departments of municipal employment. Proposals for the amalgamation, of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, the Poor Law Workers&apos; Union, the National Union of Asylum Workers, the National Poor Law Officers&apos; Association and the non-craft unions, are put forward &apos;by five of the branches. The agenda also contains resolutions dealing with the length of the working week, and the administration of the union&apos;s political fund.Trade Union Topics.  .National Sailors and Firemerts Union. It is reported that the proposals for the amalgamation of the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union, the British Seafarers&apos; Union and the Hull Seamen and Marine Firemen&apos;s Amalgamated Association,! are shortly to be considered at a conference of these three unions, and that a committee will be formed to consider and report on a draft scheme.National Union of General Workers. At a meeting of Midland delegates of the National Union of General Workers at Nottingham, it was announced that negotiations have been completed for the amalgamation of the Birmingham, Gas and Municipal and General Workers&apos; Union with the National Union of General Workers. The membership of the former society was 47,000 at the end of 1919, and is now reported to be 60,000.Ex-Service Men.Discharges of Ex-Service Men (Bristol). A notice issued by the Postmaster-General, announcing that temporary postal workers in Bristol, most of whom are ex-Service men, are shortly to be discharged, has aroused protest in the city. At a mass meeting of tem-porary postal workers on the 22nd August, the chairman pointed out that although only a few were at present affected, the meeting was representative of a national movement to protest against the notice of discharges. They recognised that they had signed agree-ments whereby their engagements could be terminated on due notice, but unemployment* See this Eeport, Vol. II, No. 2, 10th July, p. 44. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 5, 31st July, p. 170.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Coal Miners (National,)-The result of the coal miners&apos; national ballot shows 606,782 in favour and 238,865 against a strike, giving a majority of 367,917 in favour. The ballot figures showed a considerable minority against a strike in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire ; the majority in favour was most marked in the Northumberland, Lancashire and Cheshire and Forest of Dean districts. At a meeting of the Triple Industrial. Alliance on the 31st August a resolution was passed that the constituent bodies are unanimously of opinion that the miners&apos; claims &quot;are both reasonable and just, and should be conceded forthwith.&quot;Colliery Examiners, Deputies and Firemen. A national conference of the Federation of Colliery Examiners, Deputies and Firemen was held in private in London on the 25th August, when a report was given of the interview with the Coal Controller, on the previous day, to discuss the national demand for an increase in wages-of 2s. per shift and a reduction in the price of domestic coal by 14s. 2d. per ton. It was decided to take a ballot of the members on the question of striking in support of these demands, which are similar to those put forward by the Miners&apos; Federation.Engineers (Manchester). The Manchester District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union have decided to continue the embargo placed on the working of overtime on maintenance and repairs since the middle of July, despite the instructions for its with-drawal issued by the national executive. It is further reported that all the members of the District Committee have resigned rather than carry out these instructions. The embargo is stated to be causing serious inconvenience in the cotton trade and in certain public services in the district.Dyers and Finishers (Textile Trade). At a conference of the executive committees of trade unions in the dyeing and finishing section of the textile trade, on the 28th August, it was decided.to apply for an advance of 40 per cent, on current wages as from the 13th October, when notices to terminate the present agreement expire.Pottery Workers. Pottery workers are demanding a 21J per cent, increase in wages. They have rejected the employers&apos; offer to submit the claim to arbitration, and, failing a settlement, it has been decided to give a month&apos;s notice to cease work on the 30th&apos; September.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Shipwrights (Liverpool).-A strike of approximately 3,500 men, members of the local ship constructors&apos; and shipwrights&apos; association, began at Liverpool on the 26th August. The men demand a minimum wage of  6 per week, primarily to meet the rise in the price of tools.among ex-Service men was such that drastic measures were required to prevent a further increase. A large amount of overtime was being worked locally. He believed the over-time worked throughout the country was a third of the whole time worked, and its stoppage would provide employment for 5,500 men. He read resolutions which it was suggested should, be forwarded to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Labour, the Postmaster-General, Earl Haig, the local members of Parliament and others. One resolution asked that the Minister of Labour should call a conference to find a solution of the problem confronting ex-Service men employed as temporary workers in the Post Office. A letter was sent to the King from the meeting asking His Majesty&apos;s intervention on behalf of the men.Training of Ex-Service Men. The Ministry of Agriculture have announced that no further applications from disabled ex-Service men for agricultural training will be con-sidered unless lodged on or before the 30th September.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Electricians (Penistone). The Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federation have issued lock-out notices to members of the Electrical Trades Union employed by federated firms, to expire on the 4th September, in connection with the dispute at the Penistone works of Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., Ltd., over the electrical foreman who refuses to resume his membership of the unioji. An informal conference was held on the 30th August between Sir David Shackleton and-representatives of the Electrical Trades Union and the other unions immediately concerned, namely, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, and the National Federation of General Workers.Platers&apos; Helpers (Clyde District). The strike of platers&apos; helpers which began on the 6th August at two shipyards on the Clyde has spread during the week.Printers (Manchester and Liverpool).-ln connection with the dispute in the printing trade, mentioned in previous reports, a strike of members of the Typographical Association in Manchester and Liverpool occurred on the 28th August. It is understood that all daily newspapers have stopped, except the northern edition of the Daily Mail, the men&apos;s demand for a further increase of 10s. per week having been conceded by this paper.Settlements and Agreements.Marine Wireless Operators.-As a result of negotiations, continuing since the settle-ment of the marine wireless operators&apos; strike on the 24th June,* an agreement has been signed by the London and District Association of Engineering Employers, the Marconi International Marine Communication Co., Ltd., and the Association of Wireless Tele-graphists, whereby the operators obtain an average increase in wages of 156 per cent, above pre-war rates, and certain improvements in connection with shore and other allowances.Co-operative Wholesale Society Employees. A settlement has been reached of the wages disputef between the Co-operative Wholesale Society and their employees. An amended offer by the directors has been accepted, and, as a result, a local strike which occurred at Newcastle on the 16th August ended on the .24th August.     &apos; .[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Departments section of the Report, pages 329 to 331.]* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 1, 3rd July, p. 10. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 204.

The vacancies carried iorward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 767 as regards men, and a decrease of 546 in respect of women. Increases in the men&apos;s register are reported, from the West Midlands, Yorkshire and East Midlands, North-Western, Northern and Ireland Divisions, the other divisions reporting decreases. As regards the women&apos;s register all, except the Northern and Wales. Divisions, show increases.Men&apos;s Employment.General Outlook. The labour situation in the shipbuilding and allied industries has not undergone any appreciable change. In Scotland, the leading comment on these industries is the prevailing insufficiency of raw material, which is still seriously curbing activity. On the Tyne and Wear the demand for labour is still small. Most firms on the Tees have been closed down for the annual race-week holiday. There has been at slight decrease in unemployment in the Hartlepools area, owing to the fact that one or two ships are. being overhauled. The industries on the Mersey still show no signs of renewed activity, and unemployment seems to be on the increase. Steps are being taken wherever possible to transfer the skilled workers to other districts.In the North-Western Division the general engineering industry is still very unsettled, with frequent discharges and stoppage of night shifts. Revival is still awaited in the cotton industry, but the outlook on the whole is improved. Increased activity is reported in the markets in cotton piece goods Certain districts such as Nelson and Rawtenstall are still enjoying a fair amount of trade, and labour is being imported into these districts from Great Harwood, Colne and other places.No improvement is reported in the boot and shoe trade, but there are some indications of an improvement in the leather trade, as for example, at Bclton, where the workers, who have been on short time for the past three months, will resume full time working within the next fortnight. There is still a considerable amount of unemployment in the wool section of the textile trade, owing to unsettled conditions in the home and foreign markets. The lace industry is still far from flourishing, although there has been a slight improvement at Long Eaton, where the makers of the finer qualities of lace have obtained a number of orders for new patterns. The general position, however, is still discouraging, and the fall in cotton is not likely to improve matters, as the buyers are disinclined to make purchases until the price is stabilised.
Industrial Developments.-lt is reported from Dumfries that Messrs. Lochar, Ltd., have resumed operations on a small scale for the present, but hope to attain their former rate of production in the near future.Shortage of Labour. The situation in London in the building trades has not undergone any appreciable change. The demand for skilled workmen is still insistent, and the supply exceedingly small. The greatest difficulty is with bricklayers. The demand for carpenters is satisfied with less difficulty. It is impossible to meet the current demands for good joiners. The supply of plasterers is also inadequate, and the shortage is likely to increase as the building schemes progress. The position as regards house painters has much improved,&quot;and there is now a continual demand, which has so far been successfully met. The difficulty in placing general labourers, fitters&apos; mates, electricians&apos; mates and painters&apos; labourers is still felt. The men registered for work in these occupations are of an inferior type, with but little experience. A similar position prevails at the provincial Exchanges wherever there are building schemes.There is still an unsatisfied demand for moulders of all classes, shipwrights, coach makers and repairers, wagon makers and repairers, wheelwrights, forge workers, squads of riveters, ship-painters and armature winders. . ,  *Labour Reductions. The Whitfield Aviation Co., Ltd., Richmond, Surrey, are closing down. There have been a number of discharges by the Slough Trading Co. Messrs. J. Dickinson &amp; Co., Ltd., Apsley, paper makers, are discharging about 100 workpeople. The Laundry Engineering Works, Keighley, are closing down. Aston report that the Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., have discharged about 700 workpeople this week, due to the change from a three-shift to a two-shift system. The Aire &amp; Calder Navigation, Goole, are reducing staff. It was expected that at least 600 men would be paid off at the works of Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitwortb. &amp; Co., Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne, last week-end, and that within a fortnight more than 1,000 would be discharged.Shortage of Material. Brixton report that several engineering firms complain of delay in obtaining materials. The Hampton Engineering Co., Ltd., Stroud, have dis-charged fitters with a promise of re-engagement when material is forthcoming. At Goole work is very slack owing to a shortage of ships&apos; plates, restriction of the export of coal and the depression in the shipping trade. The shortage of castings is still a retarding factor in the engineering trade at Johnstone. A firm of shipbuilders at Paisley, who have four vessels near completion, are at a standstill, and cannot obtain even small supplies from the steel works.Miscellaneous. In view of the serious state of the boot and shoe industry at North-ampton a Distress Committee has been formed, with whom about 100 applicants have registered their names. The majority are young ex-Service boot operatives. Messrs. Green, of Ayr, have commenced to build a  40,000 picture house in Ayr by direct labour.Women&apos;s Employment.]General Industrial Situation. The general tone of reports received from the divisions indicates little change. The general tendency appears to be for short time to be worked, but in a number of cases discharges have taken, place, and the live register of applicants has risen, whilst the number of vacancies carried forward is on the decrease.The North-Western Division report that depression in the cotton trade is still prevalent in various districts. There is still, however, a large unsatisfied demand for weavers and skilled cotton operatives. General slackness is also reported in the silk,^rubber, matting, wire, paper, cable and jute industries.The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division also report that there does not appear to be any immediate prospect of improvement in the state of trade. The industries affected are the woollen and worsted trades, the wholesale clothing, lace and hosiery trades, and the leather trades. Actual discharges are not generally taking place, but short time is the rule.In Scotland depression is being experienced in the hosiery mills, and many textile workers have been dismissed from the cloth finishing firms. Canvas work is slack in Greenock and Port Glasgow, at Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy the linen industry is unsettled and slackness continues in the jute trade at Dundee.The West Midlands Division continue to report slackness in most of the staple industries.  The demand for women in the pottery trade, however, continues good.(B 16413) 2 T
In the London and South-Eastern Division the industrial districts still report that many local factories are working short time and live registers are increasing.In the South Midlands and Eastern Division the serious depression in the boot and shoe industry continues. Short time is being worked in the hosiery factories, and slackness is prevalent in the wholesale clothing industry. . Messrs. Peek, Frean &amp; Co., Ltd., Bedford, continue to absorb workers, and there is also a demand for women for flax pulling in the mills at Peterborough.Reports from Ireland indicate that the linen and cotton trades are depressed, and many firms are working short time. In the holiday resorts in the South and West the demand for seasonal workers has been small.Local Reports.In Canning Town, soap manufacturers, rubber manufacturers and seed crushing firms are on short time, and workers are being discharged. Deptford again report a rise in the live register, and live unemployment insurance claims have increased to over 1,000. Women have been discharged by the Edison-Swan Electric Co., Ltd., and by Messrs. NobePs Explosives Co., Ltd., in the Enfield area. Great Marlborough Street report a slight increase in-orders from the clothing trades, but state there is great difficulty in. placing clerical and semi-skilled factory workers.King&apos;s Cross report unemployment in the tobacco, dress and leather trades. Leyton report revival in the blouse industry, but marked unemployment in the furnishing, boot and printing trades.The South-Western Division report that a ganger placed by the Gloucester Exchange to take charge of hop pickers at Ledbury is arranging to engage 180 workers through the Hereford Exchange. The corset and chocolate industries are reported slack by the Kingswood Exchange, Bristol. Bromsgrove report that half of the local firms are working short time. Efforts are being made to arrange for the conveyance of women workers by omnibus to Redditch, where there is a demand for women in the needle and fish-hook trade, but the question of fares is causing difficulties. At Burslem,there is a good demand for women workers in the pottery trade. At Kidderminster experienced workers or suitable learners can always be placed in the textile trades. A Birmingham firm of brass workers have recently opened a small works in this town, and are engaging women through the Exchange. At Worcester women tin workers are still being discharged, and hollow-ware workers at West Bromwich.At Coggeshall, near Braintree, a wholesale clothing firm are closing down owing to depression in trade, and about 100 women will be thrown out of employment.Local holidays are still reported from many towns in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. Depression is felt keenly in the lace trade in Nottingham, Basford, Derby, Long Eaton and Ilkeston. The last-named Exchange report a slight revival in some branches of the hosiery trade, which is still, however, depressed at Derby and Nottingham.At Shipley it is reported that Messrs. Beaver &amp; Co., Bingley, spinners, are working short time.About 30 women and girls have been recruited from the Snaith and Carlton districts in the Goole Exchange area for employment in the Selby flax mills, and workers are being specially conveyed. Others have been placed in these mills by the South Milford Branch Office attached to the Castleford Exchange.Buffers and burnishers are needed for the cutlery trade at Sheffield. The shortage of housing accommodation continues to retard the importation of textile workers at Sowerby Bridge, and of sewing machinists at Hebden Bridge.The Accrington and Blackburn Exchanges report depression in the cotton trade. .At Burnley the live register is increasing owing to the continued depression in this industry, and many of the textile applicants now registering^ are married women whose husbands are also employed in the mills. In Colne many weavers have been placed in temporary work in the local jam works.At Macclesfield the silk making-up trade remains slack, and many women are working short time. At Ashton-under-Lyne and New Mills employment remains good, and the textile industries in Royton are working full time.The larger firms in the Elswick area are discharging workers. At Whitehaven local factories are very slack.Aberdeen report that owing to the poor fishing season a comparatively small number of women have been engaged in the preserving works. The Bridgeton Exchange, Glasgow, report that vacancies have been notified from a firm of textile weavers for girls of 18 to

There is an increased demand at Edinburgh for typists, and a number of placings have been effected by the commercial section, of the Glasgow Exchange. Employment continues good in the woollen mills at Galashiels, but at Irvine there is increasing unemployment among hosiery workers. A firm of chemical manufacturers in this town are trying to develop a new bottle making industry, for which a number of women may be required. Industry has been at a standstill at Kilmarnock owing to the bursting of the riverbanks and the derangement of the electrical power supply.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. A deputation from Colchester recently attended at the Ministry of Transport to seek financial assistance for developing the river Colne. If this work could be carried out new industries would be brought in and existing industries extended. The estimated cost of the work was  220,000, and the deputation asked the Ministry of Transport to supply,two-thirds of this amount. The Ministry of Transport pointed out that the proportion of the money at their disposal which could be devoted to Colchester would be negligible in comparison with the amount estimated as required. They promised, however, to give a technical opinion on the scheme.The Portsmouth Committee have been asked by jJie Corporation to consider a scheme for employing workpeople on ship-breaking, and the committee are getting in touch with Lord Lytton on the subject.Romford are experiencing difficulty in getting the requisite supply of skilled workers in connection with local housing schemes, and have decided to advertise outside the locality for the necessary labour. At Winchester the contractors engaged on, the local housing schemes are standing men off, while others are working overtime, and it has been decided to approach the master builders&apos; association in the matter.Training. The Cannock Committee have decided to include in the Employment Exchange vacancy lists exhibited in the local post offices a notice calling attention to the training facilities for widows of members of the Forces.Ex-Service Men. Hendon have suggested that in view of the inadequacy of existing arrangements for placing ex-Service men now out of employment, the Government should organise one or more co-operative colonies, of which they give details in a memorandum. Clapham Junction request the Minister to take action with a view to the removal of the Army Order which at present debars a man in receipt of a disability pension from re-enlist-ment. Portsmouth report that, as a result of strong representations by the committee, the Admiral Superintendent of. the Dockyard has agreed to replace certain women in the foundry by disabled ex-Service men.
DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.i Up to and including the 25th August, the number of certificates which had been issued to employers enrolled under the scheme was 19,643. These employers are employing, in all, 3,199,253 workpeople, and their undertakings cover 188,697 disabled men.As a result of the special canvassing campaign, a firm of paper manufacturers at Rutherglen have decided to institute a double shift system at their works, and as an experi-ment are prepared to start six disabled men at once,at a wage of 50s. for a 44-hour week, rising to 60s. and higher after a month&apos;s probation. The conditions of work are exceptionally good, the work being of a light nature, and the workers seated all the time. Intervals for smoking during working hours are arranged, and there is a well-equipped canteen. If the experiment succeeds the firm hope to employ 30 disabled men.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Apprenticeship.&apos; The scheme prepared by the Industrial Council for the Building Industry has now been considered by a number of Juvenile Employment Committees. In some cases, as, for example, at Altrincham, Birmingham, Cambridge, Huddersfield, Leeds, Northwich, Stockton and Wigan, the committees are approaching the local associa-tions with regard to the adoption of the scheme. The Shrewsbury Committee are taking action through their Apprenticeship Sub-Committee, and hope to secure the adoption of the scheme in their district, while the Southport Juvenile Advisory Committee have appointed a sub-committee to consider the question. The Romford and Wakefield Committees are also anxious to see the scheme put into operation locally. In the former case, a conference of employers and employees has been held, and a representative of the Industrial Council addressed the meeting.At Grimsby, Halifax, Long Eaton, Tiverton and Worksop, the Juvenile Employment Committees have decided on account of local circumstances, to take no action. At Halifax a scheme has already been adopted, and the employers and operatives are not desirous of altering it at present.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also be found on pages 310, 312, 313, 321, 324 and 327.]APPOINTMENTS &apos; DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.Appointments.The figures relating to appointments are shown below: 	Week Ending	Week Ending	Total at	13th August.	20th August.	20th August.Candidates available for appointments 			Ex-Service men       ..................	806	961	14,111Civilians       ...........,     .........	25	28	2,015Vacancies 			Vacancies registered ...     ...	613	590	71,250&quot; Live &quot; vacancies    ..................	1,557	1,488	Candidates submitted to employers.........	3,706	3,934	271,217Candidates known to have been placed       ...     ......	511	459	38,719Of the candidates known to have been placed, 5,184 were placed through the agency of Interviewing Boards.   -Employment Department-continued.

The Director at Manchester reports that, despite an apparent depression in the engineering industry, the department received three good vacancies from engineering firms of considerable standing. No marked improvement is noted with regard to vacancies received from firms engaged in the textile industry.The Mayors in the Leeds Directorate have received the King&apos;s letter, and in every case are co-operating with the department with a view to issuing a special appeal to employers.The Director at Birmingham reports that industrial conditions in the Black Country appear to be improving. Ironfounders and casters are working full time, and are experiencing difficulty in getting ahead of orders. Manufacturers state that foreign competition is very keen, and several contracts have recently been, lost owing to the &quot; labour clause.&quot;
4.0.20.322TRAINING DEPARTMENT.EX-SERVICE MEN.General.The Yew&apos;s Statistics. Full responsibility for training was taken over by the Ministry on the 1st August, 1919. In the first completed year, 37,662 cases had been dealt with, 13,812 men having passed through the various forms of training provided and 23,850 being still under instruction. The Ministry of Labour started the year with an inheritance from the Ministry of Pensions of 10,000 men in training. With the increased training facili-ties provided, and the general development of the scheme, the number of men in training increased by approximately 140 per cent. If to the total of terminations during the year be added the 11,000 men estimated to have completed their training under the Ministry of Pensions, it will be seen that approximately 25,000 men have finished their course, and it may be assumed that the majority are now earning their living.An analysis of the waiting lists at the end of July shows that in 15 divisions 2,000 names were added to*fcke lists during the month, and that there were over 3,000 withdrawals due, in approximately 45 per cent, of the cases, to transfer to a training centre, and in the remainder to &quot; some other cause.&quot; Over 90 per cent, of the men in the latter category were to be found in four divisions, including London, which had long waiting lists in active process of revision. Rather over 20 per cent, of the men included in the waiting lists at the end of July had been passed by a Local Technical Advisory Committee or approved for some non-special trade, and were therefore ready to start training as soon as vacancies become available.The analysis covers all the divisions except one, and the figures should only be taken as approximate. They indicate that in so far as the waiting lists are really of a live character, in most divisions facilities and opportunities for training are beginning to overtake the demand.Hostels. In the group of hostels at Birtley and the 11 other hostels for which the Minis-try of Labour are responsible, there are now 358 men in residence. Nearly half of these are at Birtley, where there are also 46 cottages occupied by men in training and their families.Government Instructional Factories. The report for the week indicates very satisfactory progress. Work on the adaptation of the more recently acquired premises is being carried out rapidly, and in a number of cases the number of men in training shows a marked increase. At Chiswick there are now 224 men at work as against 150 three weeks ago, and at Cathcart 241, or twice as many as at the beginning of July. The Lavender Hill and the Tottenham High Road Factories are practically full, and the number of men at Radnor Road, Bristol, now exceeds 200. The number of men training in Government factories on the 14th August stood at 5,688, as against less than 800 in August last year. The number of factories now on the active list is 44 as against 10 in August, 1919.Schemes Sanctioned.During the week 17 schemes, providing 550 places, have been sanctioned. Included in this number are 152 places for training in various branches of the building trade.National Trade Advisory Committees.Boot and Shoe.-A meeting of the Administrative Committee (Training) of the Boot and Shoe Trade Board was held on the 17th August. Permission was given for the establish-ment of a class, not exceeding six in number, at the Ministry of Pensions Convalescent Centre, Birmingham. The committee recommended that the present small class at Brent-wood should be discontinued and the trainees transferred to another centre. Some 27 applications lor training were approved.Gold, Silver, Horological and Allied Trades. - A meeting of the committee was held on the 17th August. The question of the exhibition of work done by trainees was considered, and it was decided that it would be advisable to hold such exhibitions in all centres where training was taking place. It was suggested that each class should place on one side any good specimens of work done, and that every six months the trade should be invited to visit the class and inspect the exhibits and work of the trainees, lt was further suggested that arrangements should be made for exhibits to be taken to meetings of branches of the National Association of Goldsmiths.
Ex-Service Men-continued.Leather Goods. A meeting of the committee was held on, the 23rd August, when the draft revised Report was finally approved. A letter from the National Leather Goods Manufacturers&apos; Association was considered, and it was unanimously resolved that the depression in the trade in London was such as to justify no further trainees being accepted for three months.A long&apos;discussion took place on a resolution of the London Local Technical Advisory Committee that trainees now serving under the old nine months arrangement be allowed to extend this to twelve months in the technical institute. It was pointed out that the department had no power to extend training in a technical school. In view of the serious depression of the trade and the difficulty of placing men for workshop training after training in a technical school, it was decided to urge the department to obtain relaxation of the present rule limiting institutional training.Local Technical Advisory Committees.Building. The inaugural meetings of the Exeter, Bangor and Colwyn Bay Local Technical Advisory Committees Were held on the 12th, 16th and 17th August, respectively.Gold, Silver, Horological and Allied Trades. The secretary attended the inaugural meeting of the Preston Local Technical Advisory Committee on the 19th August. Only three members on the employers&apos; side were present, and it was unanimously agreed that unless the employers were prepared to show more sympathy and enthusiasm it would be impossible to start a training class. It was eventually resolved that every member of the trade at Preston should be invited to attend a meeting at an early date.APPRENTICES AND BOYS. INTERRUPTED APPRENTICESHIPS.Questions Affecting the Scheme.Wages. Difficulties sometimes arise as regards payment of apprentices ,after the close of renewed apprenticeship. In the West Midlands area, at any rate, instances in which the full journeyman&apos;s rate is not paid seem not to be uncommon. Local headquarters point out that this sometimes occurs in first-class firms, as the termination of training does not necessarily coincide with reaching full industrial capacity. It is very probable, however, that the real reason is in the attitude of the other workmen, both skilled and partially trained, who are jealous of the financial advantages accruing to the apprentice. Such an attitude appears to be uncommon in the North-Western area. A Rochdale engineering firm, however, urge that payment according to the scheme will give the returning apprentices more than those who have not served.The Scheme in Operation.Statistics. Up to the 25th August, 41 schemes had been approved, and applications had been received in respect of all of them. The number of,applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices for the week ending the 16th August was 237, making a total of 43,169. The number of applications received from apprentices was 238, making a total of 48,473.Up to the 25th August agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 41,513 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 39,882 apprentices employed by 15,903 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, pr by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 9,247.Applications. To ensure that as lew apprentices as possible shall fail to secure the benefits of the scheme, the department have made special efforts to induce all eligible apprentices not yet under the scheme to put in their applications before the 30th September. It is often easiest to obtain the application from the apprentice first, and to deal subse-quently with the employer. This, no doubt, has helped to increase the excess of apprentices, and there are good prospects that employers will eventually be forthcoming.A systematic visiting of officials of all associations likely to be able to assist in bringing apprentices under the scheme is proceeding in the South Midlands and Eastern area. The latest return of applications from the area is the largest in any week, except one, since the middle of April.  In Wales the number of apprentice applicants for whom no employers
Apprentices and Boys-continued.can be found is slowly decreasing, and local headquarters are taking special measures to deal with their cases individually. In this connection the Redruth Employment Committee have passed a resolution that all apprentices who cannot be placed with private employers should be trained by the State. The conditions of the scheme require an apprentice to be brought under it with a definite employer, and so do not permit the department to adopt the proposal.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. Local headquarters for the Northern area continue to put unplaced apprentices on probation with new employers, who will bring them under the scheme if satisfactory. Two men so placed recently are a motor engineer, in receipt of out-of-work donation, and a whitesmith.Non-Observance of Conditions. Local headquarters for the Northern area report that about 50 firms, mostly of a fair size, are not making the required payments before claiming State grant, though getting the apprentices&apos; signatures for them, and in almost every case their payments are short by the amount of the State grant.Training in Operation: Progress. Reports on individual employers confirm the general views previously expressed. The North British Locomotive Co., Ltd., Glasgow, are discussing the matter of intensive practical training, and will shortly submit definite proposals to local headquarters.Strihs. In the Yorkshire and East Midlands area, union officials are endeavouring not to disturb apprentices under the scheme during strikes. In the furniture industry, for instance, the apprentices were only brought out after the dispute had lasted a month, and even then only from fear that they would be at a disadvantage afterwards, owing to bad feeling being created among the journeymen if they had remained at work. .Institutional Training. At Glasgow a class is being promoted for engineering apprentices, who are being suspended in alternate weeks owing to slackness of work. - There should be little difficulty in securing sufficient students, and it is hoped that certain administrative difficulties are being overcome.GENERAL TRAINING.Supervision of Training (Works Chemists). The executive of the Institute of Chemists have recently appointed a sub-committee to inquire into the best methods of training chemical assistants and laboratory attendants. They will investigate existing schemes in large industrial concerns and elsewhere, and formulate one of their own for training in the future.Shortage of Apprentices: Bricklayers and Joiners (London). All important firms attribute the shortage of bricklayers to the uncertainty of this work, its exposed nature, the small difference between the pay of skilled and unskilled men, and the ease with which unskilled men get classed as journeymen. This last influence in particular has produced a very serious shortage of really skilled bricklayers. The joiners appear also to be seriously affected by the small difference between the wages of the skilled and unskilled men. The provision and upkeep of tools is a very serious expense.[Reference to matters of interest to the Training Department will also be found on pages 313 and 319.]INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION. JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: NEGOTIATIONS.Civil Service and Government Industrial Establishments. A conference was held at the Ministry, on the. 27th August, of representatives of the Treasury and of those depart-ments having Councils both under the Whitley Scheme for the Civil Service ^ and under that for Government industrial establishments, to consider the position of certain classes of Government employees who occupy a marginal position as between an administrative and an industrial classification, and also to discuss the relation between the local committees
set up in any establishment under the administrative and the industrial schemes, respec-tively, and to the extent to which it might be desirable for them to consider certain questions jointly. With regard to those classes whose allocation between the administrative and the industrial schemes presented difficulties, it was -agreed that the adoption of a rigid line of demarcation, at this stage, would be undesirable, but that the position of any particular class should be determined, wherever possible, by agreement between the department and the parties concerned. It was recognised that the department involved should con-suit other departments likely to be concerned in any decision, with a view to securing a uniform policy. With regard to the relation between the administrative and the industrial committees in any establishment, it was agreed that it was desirable to keep the deliberations of the two bodies separate, although the possibility of a joint discussion in special circum-stances, and with the consent of all parties, was not precluded.Breiving. The secretary of the Brewers&apos; Society was interviewed on the 28th August, and the result of the departments investigation into the organisation of the industry was communicated to him. He expected no opposition from his society to the proposed Joint District Council for the Nottingham area, or to any similar district proposals which may mature. He undertook to discuss the whole question with his society, and communicate their views at an early date.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: REPORTS.Baling (Scottish). At a meeting at Glasgow on the 26th August, the resolution put forward from the operatives&apos; side for the dissolution of the Council was withdrawn, after attention had been called to the failure of the employers&apos; association to enforce the CounciFs agreements in Elgin, Kinross, Montrose, Leslie and Berwick. The question of the employ-ment of female labour was deferred to a meeting of the Council in a month&apos;s time. Mean-while both sides of the Council are pledged to endeavour to bring about a return to pre-war conditions.Building.-Th.z Cabinet Committee on Housing have formulated modified proposals for the consideration of the Resettlement Committee, for augmenting the supply of labour and increasing output. These proposals indicate the desire of the Government to adopt as far as possible the Resettlement Committee&apos;s standpoint, and to negotiate further on matters affecting the application of the principles laid down. They suggest that the number of apprentices to be allowed under the existing regulations shall be, during the first year, double the number permitted under the Committee&apos;s scheme ; that the period of apprenticeship shall be three years in all cases ; that the minimum wage to be paid shall be 50 per cent, of the journeyman&apos;s wage for the first six months of indenture, with graduated increases; and that steps shall be taken to secure that operatives in all trades shall definitely co-operate in the teaching of new men, in order that they may become speedily proficient. It is also suggested that the housing schemes shall have the first call upon labour, to which end trade union organisers should prepare returns of all men willing to work on housing schemes in their own districts, and should then endeavour to ascertain the deficiencies of labour on schemes from time to time ; and that steps be taken to prevent the practice of offering terms in excess of recognised rates, to attract building labour, to the detriment of housing work.On the question of increasing output, the Government insist that the Committee should make concrete suggestions, in default of accepting the principle of payment by results.  The Committee are considering their reply to these proposals.Electricity Supply. A meeting of the District Council for South Wales and Monmouth-shire was held on the 23rd August. An application by the trade union side for an advance of wages was deferred until a deputation of both sides had met the secretary of the National Council, to ascertain the position in regard to the arbitration on the national claim.Glass-On the 24th August, the chairman and the vice-chairman of the Council gave evidence before the Departmental Committee appointed by the Home Secretary to con-sider the advisability of amending the Factory Acts, so as to allow women and young persons to work on two shifts during the day-time. Evidence is also to be given by the constituent associations.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).-A meeting of the executive committee of the District Council for the Northern Home Counties was held on the 26th August, to arbitrate in claims by the municipal employees at Ilford, Tottenham and Acton to be paid the London rates. Agreement on a slightly lower figure was reached, which. has to be confirmed by the full Council on the. (b 16413) 2 U
3rd September. The District Council for the West Riding of Yorkshire met on the 26th August. A proposal from the trade union side that the minimum rates fixed in May should be increased by 3d!, per hour was rejected by the employers. The question is to be further considered at the next meeting.Paint and Varnish. The workers&apos; side have accepted the employers&apos; offer, made at the last meeting of the Council, of a general increase of 5s. per week for men over 21, making the minimum rate 68s.; a general advance of 2s. per week for women over 21, if rated at 38s., an advance of 3s. for women rated above 38s., with proportionate advances for men and women under 21, and for boys and girls under 18. These advances took effect from the 1st August.Printing. The employers met the Typographical Association on the 24th August, to discuss the regrading of Manchester and Liverpool. It was agreed that no case had been made out for improving the status of these towns, but, as there seemed to be some-thing to be said in favour of a general increase in wages, a conference was arranged for the 14th September, when the whole wages position was to be reviewed. In spite of this agreement, a mass meeting of the members of the Association in Manchester, on the 26th August, agreed to stop work at 1 p.m. on the 27th.Rubber. The parties to the Council have consented to meet again on the 24th September at Montagu House, to continue the discussion adjourned from the 2nd June on the claim for an advance in wages. The employers wish the matter to be dealt with by the District Councils, which gives power to make local arrangements.Waterworks Undertakings. The District Council for the Home Counties met on the 23rd August. An award of the National Council relating to minimum wages of stokers, turncocks, jointers, service layers of communication pipes, meter readers, and engine drivers, given as the result of a joint reference from both sides of the District Council, was rejected by the employers&apos; side. After protracted discussion, further consideration was postponed to the 31st August.Vehicle Building. The present wages agreement expires on the 1st September, and the National Union of Vehicle Builders have made a demand for an advance of Qd. per hour on minimum rates. There have been several separate meetings with the employers&apos; associations, who have met in conference to decide upon a joint policy, but were unable to come to any agreement. The National Employers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders, however, have made an offer involving an average advance of 2d. per hour. The National Union of Vehicle Builders are balloting their members on the offer, which is likely to be accepted. The National Federation of Vehicle Trades and the Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association have not yet made an offer, but it is thought that they will eventually come into line with the National Employers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: WORKS COMMITTEES.Brewing. Inquiries in the Northumberland and Sunderland districts have been continued. The formation of works committees is under consideration by Messrs. R. Deuchars, Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne^ and Messrs. J. Rowell &amp; Son, Ltd., Gateshead-on-Tyne.Bobbin and Shuttle Making. Representatives of the management and employees at the works of Messrs. Pilkington &amp; Co., Ltd., Heywoocl, have been interviewed, and the formation of a works committee is under consideration.Flour Milling. Works committees of a more or less informal nature are in existence at the works of Messrs. A. McDougall, Ltd., W. Sutcliffe &amp; Sons, and T. Hulbert &amp; Son, of Manchester, Messrs. J. &amp; W. Attlee, Dorking, and Messrs. Wingent &amp; Kimmens, Chatham. Visits have been paid, and the adoption of constitutions in accordance with the recom-mendations of the Council is under consideration.Pottery.-Visits are now being paid to works in Scotland in addition to the Staffordshire area. At the works of Messrs. D. Methven and Sons, Kirkcaldy, arrangements have been made to meet a provisional committee to draw up a constitution. The managements of Messrs. C. W. McNay &amp; Sons, Bo&apos;ness, the West Lothian Pottery Co., Ltd., Bo&apos;ness, and Messrs. R. Heron &amp; Son, Kirkcaldy, have decided in favour of works committees. In Staffordshire the formation of works committees is under consideration by the manage-ments of six Burslem firms. Arrangements have been made to address meetings of the employees of Messrs. A. J. Wilkinson &amp; Co., Messrs. Deans (Elton), Ltd., and Messrs. G. Wade &amp; Co., all of Burslem.

WAGES AND ARBITRATION DEPARTMENTAWARDS.The number of awards issued during the week was 22, of which 13 were under the Industrial Courts Act.Engineering and Foundry Trades (Dundee). Advances of 2s. per week were granted to strikers and boilermakers in the engineering industry in Dundee. (Awards Nos. 449 and 452.)Steel Workers (Consett and Newburn). The Court decided that effect should be given to the employers&apos; proposal with regard to the basic rate and tonnage rate of gas producer firemen, and held that the basic melters&apos; sliding scale should be applied to these rates. (Award No. 459.)Carters (Scotland). An advance of 2s. Qd. per week was granted to men 18 years of age and over, in addition to the advance of 5s. already conceded by the employers. (Award No. 460.)Electrical Workers (Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers, Ltd.). The Court, while not prepared to say that the basic rates laid down in Award No. 2772 of the Committee on Production should be applied, decided that the men concerned, who are special to electrical work and employed solely in the power-house, should be considered as electrical workers, and the parties should meet and agree rates of pay.   (Award No. 461.)Semi-skilled Workers : Steel Foundries (Scotland).-It was found that the reasons for the recent adjustment of the rates of moulders and dressers did not apply to the case of semi-skilled men and labourers.  (Award No. 463.)AGREEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS.Fitters and Turners (Great Central Railway). For about four months an embargo has been laid by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and subsequently by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, upon employment with the Great Central Railway at Grimsby and Immingham. The union withdrew their members from the company&apos;s service owing to the refusal of certain demands concerning overtime rates.After several fruitless attempts to arrange a settlement, a conference was arranged for the 21st August, at Grimsby, a representative of the department presiding. The union representatives claimed that district conditions must be coupled with district rates, and that the company, in accordance with their agreement, should agree to local conditions. On behalf of the company it was urged that, while they were quite willing to pay district rates, and to observe working conditions which were nationally agreed to, it was denied that conditions were implied in wages agreements. Eventually an agreement was arrived at that payment be made at the rate of 2j hours instead of 2 hours for each hour worked between midnight on Saturday and 7.30 a.m. on Sunday, and between 5 p.m. and midnight on Sunday ; that time-and-a-half be paid for all work on Bank holidays; that the first 2 hours overtime be paid for at time-and-a-half, instead of time-and-a-quarter as at present; and that the men receive, when working away from the home depot for not less than 4 hours, Is. per day extra for expenses. All members withdrawn or discharged owing to the dispute, will be reinstated, the understanding being that such men will return on or before the 1st September.This agreement is subject to adjustment in accordance with the national agreement resulting from the negotiations now proceeding as to men employed in railway workshops.Trade Boards Division-continued,ESTABLISHMENT AND AMENDMENT OF TRADE BOARDS.New Bottrds.-The Minister has given Notice of Intention to apply the Trade Boards Acts to the Ostrich Feather and Artificial Flower Trade.

Wages and Arbitration Department-continued.Corporation Employees (Cardiff). In May last the trade union side of the South Wales and Monmouthshire District Council of the Joint Industrial Council submitted a claim for 2s. per hour for men permanently employed by the several Corporations, in anticipation of the raising of general labourers&apos; rates to 2s. per hour, consequent upon increases granted to the building trade. The question came before the Council on the 29th June, when the application was modified to Is. 9d. per hour for casual labourers and Is. Sd. per hour to permanent men. It was finally decided that casual men were to receive casual rates of Is. 9d., and that the difference between casual and permanent men&apos;s rates should be referred to a special meeting presided over by a neutral chairman appointed by the department.Delay occurred in the payment of the advanced rates to the casual men, who were given to understand that no arrears would be paid until the decision of the permanent men&apos;s case was known. Consequently the men employed on the permanent way by the Cardiff Tramway Department came out on strike, bringing out in sympathy the employees at the electrical power-station and the tramwaymen. A new demand of 2s. per hour for casual men was formulated, but refused.At the special conference, held on the 7th August, the union representatives endeavoured to secure the amendment of the terms of reference, so as to make the appli-cation one for 2s. Id. and 2s. to casual and permanent men respectively. The chairman, acting as arbitrator, stated that he had no authority to amend the terms of reference without the consent of the employers&apos; side, which was refused. His award, issued on the 23rd August, granted Is. Sd. per hour to the permanent men, as from 6th May, the date of the application.  The men have accepted this, and have returned to work.The question of a further increase will presumably be submitted in due course to the District Council. The Swansea Corporation, who are not represented on the Council, and whose employees are enrolled in the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union, have agreed to pay  4 7s. Qd. for a 47-hour week, that is, Is. 10^d. per hour.Vehicle Workers (Ilebden Bridge and District). The district organiser of the United Vehicle Workers informed the Chief Conciliation Officer, Leeds, that the committee of the Hebden Bridge and District Horse Owners&apos; Association refused to meet him with reference to the union&apos;s demand for the observance of the wages and conditions recommended by the Yorkshire District Council of the Joint Industrial Council, and that,&apos; failing a settle-ment, a strike would be called. The Chief Conciliation Officer arranged a conference, as a result of which the men received the Joint Industrial Council rates of pay. A claim for one week&apos;s holiday with pay was dropped for the time being.Gypsum Miners and Plaster Workers (Nottingham). About 200 gypsum miners and plaster workers employed by the Gotham Co., Ltd., Nottingham, struck on the 5th August, in support of a demand for an increase of 10s. per week for time-workers and 9d. per ton for piece-workers. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Sheffield, arranged a conference. A settlement was reached by which time-workers received an increase of 4s. per week and piece-workers an increase of Id. per ton, as from the date of resumption of work, together with a sliding scale based on variations in the cost of living. Work was resumed on the 18th and 19th August.Seamen (Glasgow and Irish Ports). The National Sailors and Piremen&apos;s Union would not recognise this strike* officially, and requested the Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, to intervene. After several conferences, at which the owners insisted upon a resumption of work before negotiations proceeded, the men agreed to resume on the 25th August, and to leave their outstanding demands to their representatives for settlement. The claims were then discussed and settled.Corporation Tramway Employees (Southampton). The Southampton Corporation tramway employees struck on the 16th August in support of a temporary conductor who insisted on taking his rest day, which fell on August Bank Holiday, although notice had been given that every man was required to report for duty on that day. He was dismissed, and the management refused the union&apos;s demand for his re-instatement. This action was endorsed by the Tramway Committee. The Chief Conciliation Officer, London, intervened, and, in spite of much bad feeling on both sides, it was arranged for work to be resumed on the 24th August, and for the case to be referred to the Joint Industrial Council for arbitration.Textile Workers (Scotland). The threatened strikef of tape dressers on coloured work has been averted. The employers made an offer to increase their wages, conditionally upon the acceptance of Award No. 397 in its entirety by the men&apos;s society. The condition has been complied with, and the notices have been withdrawn.   .* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 9, 28th August, p. 292. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 8, 21st August, p. 282.(
3314.0.20.Wages and Arbitration Department--continued.Warehousemen (Liverpool). As a result of a conference, on the 24th August, arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer, it was agreed that the union&apos;s claim should be referred to the Negotiating Committee set up in accordance with Lord Shaw&apos;s report, with the proviso that, if the application be refused, the firm will enter into negotiations with the union as to an advance of wages.  Work was resumed on the 25th August.Railway Shopmen (Cardiff). The dispute on the Cardiff Railway, which had extended to other lines in South Wales, has been settled. The offer of a rate of  5 per week,&apos; without any differentiation between shopmen and shedmen, has been accepted by the men.Iron WorJcers (Westbury). The Conciliation Officer was successful in prevailing upon the firm to agree that, if the men would return to work on the 23rd August, they would be prepared to meet a deputation of the men, with their union representative, and discuss any grievances they had. It is understood that all the men, except the three dismissed, resumed work accordingly, and that a round table conference was to meet on the 25th August.QUESTIONS PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.Lair aye Workers (Birkenhead and Liverpool). A demand has been presented on behalf of lairage workers in the Birkenhead and Liverpool district, for a 47-hour week, with time-and-a-half for overtime, which the employers have refused on the ground that the trade is not constant, but is governed by shipments of cattle and the tides. The National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union, accordingly, on behalf of the men concerned, tendered notice to cease work, and endeavoured to arrange for other organisations to take action. The employers threatened to close the lairages in 24 hours unless the men&apos;s notices were withdrawn. As a result of the efforts of the Chief Conciliation Officer, both sides agreed to withdraw their threats, and the employers&apos; representative promised to do his utmost to bring about a joint conference of the parties.Gas Workers (Neath). On the 28th July, 30 men employed by the Neath Urban District Council struck in support of the original national demand for 10s. per week to gas workers. In the neighbouring areas of Briton Ferry, Port Talbot and Margam, the national settlement of Is. per shift was exceeded, the workers, in fact, receiving their full demand for 10s. per week. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Cardiff, has endeavoured to secure a resumption of work but so far has been unsuccessful. A large number of the strikers are at present at work elsewhere. The Council have decided to reopen the w rks on the 30th August, and to employ such men as present themselves, with any other labour which may be available.Corset Makers (Manchester). A strike occurred at the works of Messrs. J. S. Blair &amp; Son, corset manufacturers, on the 20th August, owing to the firm&apos;s decision to reduce piece-rates. The matter does not come within the scope of the Trade Board, as the firm have guaranteed the Trade Board minimum wage. It has since been reported that the state of the trade does not warrant a general stoppage, and that those who were still working decided, for the time being to continue to do so. The executive of the United Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union, have advised the reference of the dispute to the Industrial Court.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Wages -and Arbitration will be found also on pages 310 to 315 and 324 to 328.]
