The miners1 ballot has given the necessary majority for a strike and the Triple Alliance has decided that their claims are reasonable and Just.   Nevertheless, it is clear that Labour generally and the miners1 leaders in particular would welcome any esoape from their present position provided that their faces are saved.  A strike may take place, however, and it is possible that some sections of the Triple Alliance may be called out, but if so that part of the strike would be very short lived. The financial position of all the Unions is not suoh as would support a long strike.   The strike pay of the ,miners  unions will not, on the most liberal calculation, last more than three weeks.News has just come in from the Conference of Miners1 Delegates that notices are to be handed in to expire on September 25th.There is no ohange in the situation as regards the engineers; the lock-out notice to electricians, unless it is cancelled, will become effective on Saturday next.The annual meeting of the Trade Union Congress at-Portsmouth on the 6th is of exceptional importance.  An effort will almost certainly be made to set up a central body with exeoutive powers - either a Council of Action or. a General Staff for Labour.
The revolutionary tendencies of the local Councils of Action are becoming more pronounced, though the central bo is becoming timid and uncertain of ita position.&apos;Special attention is called to the remarks upon the Russian Trading Delegation, whose secret activities are largely responsible for the growth of revolutionary feelinl The Delegation has flagrantly broken its undertakings and I less concerned with trade than it is with propagandasThe temper of ex-Service men is unsatisfactory, and 8 unless something can be done to reduce unemployment it may! become serious. It must be remembered that in the event op rioting, for the first time in history the rioters will bJ better trained than the troops.There is no improvement in Ireland, but there is abundant evidence that the Sinn Feiners realise their position to be desperate and that they will be glad to fin a way out of the present impasse.   Gavan Duffy, their &quot;Ambassador&quot; in Paris, has teen ordered to leave the count within twenty-four hours.
THE COAL KBI5R.SThe official figures of the miners&apos; ballotare:tfor a strike 606,782Against 238,865Majority for strike      367,917The majority for a strike is therefore 71*75$ of the845,647 votes recorded;   the total membership of the miners Federation of Great Britain is 904,000 and theunrecorded votes amount to 6&amp;*    It is not possible toestimate the extent to which the ballot has beenmanipulated, but present conditions of voting allowgreat scope for this procedure. .  For instance, one ofmy correspondents writes:&quot;In tforth Staffordshire the balloting in one case at least took place in the street; an official came round with the ballot papers, all open in his hand, and collected them the following day in the sam manner.    He had no box to put them in,&quot;In several coalfields the men are of opinion that a strike will not occur;   this belief is based upon the conviction that the Government will give way.    It is quite safe to assume that, in the words of a trades unionist &quot;any promise of increased output by the leaders in not worth the paper it is written on.&quot;    It was recently stated at a meeting of officials that such a promise, would be &quot;a safe thing to offer and sood tactics, as there are always good excuses to offer if the promise is not carried&apos;out.&quot;    There is evidence, however, that the miners&apos; leaders do not relish the position in which they find themselves and are searching feverishly for a way of escape.     If they find that the Government stands firm, a strike seems inevitable, since capitulation wouldcompletely undermine their prestige.An exact estimate of the funds of the variousminers&apos;/
miners&apos; associations is difficult to obtain, but in the case of larger units, such as South Wales. Durham, and Scotland, v/ould only cover strike pay for two or three weeks.     In the case of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, it is doubtful if the funds amount to more than 18/- per member.     Some of the small Midland associations could probably carry on for six to eight weeks, but these have little bearing on the general, situation.The majority of miners&apos; wives appear to dread a strike and might be an important factor in shortening a struggle.There are indications that the miners realise that the withdrawal of pump and engine men would endanger their means of livelihood.    The Atherton branch of theLancashire and Cheshire Colliery Deputies Associationexpressed this view forcibly on August 28th, passingalso the following resolution:&quot;That this meeting emphatically protests against the action of the j&amp;ecutive Committee of the General Federation of Colliery Firemen, Examiners and Deputies Association, in demanding a rise in wages and 14/2d..per ton off the prise of. coal without having a mandate from the branches concerned, and that we strongly object to take part in the proposed ballot, of which the first notice we had,was from the Press.&quot;There hc.o actually been little change in thesituation;   the verbal support of the Triple Allianceis not surprising, in view of the Press campaign, but cannot be altogether discounted as bluff.    The road transport workers and the railway shopmen are factors which would predispose the unions concerned to presenta united front with the miners.     It is, however,probable that if a strike of the Alliance were called,the response of the majority of the rank and filewould/
would be unwilling-and that&apos;numbers wo-ulc\ return to work within a ehorc period.     It is said that the, strike pay at the disposal of the transport workers amounts to about 25/- per member.     At&apos;the end of 1919 the National Union of Railwaymen, with a membership of 481,081, had a total.balance of  1,188,853. 13s. lid.; part of this sum could not be immediately realised. The cost of the railway strike last year was  250,000.The, Triple Alliance has authorised the sub-committee to remain&apos; In continuous session, with power to add to its numbers and convene further meetings of the whole Alliance, as circumstances may direct, after the meeting of the miners&apos; delegates.In conversation among themselves the Triple Alliance delegates ware o:&apos;: opinion that some means would be found for calling oJf tho strike and saving the faces of Messrs.. $mil Lie and Hodges.Unions outride the Alliance are still anxious to prevent unemployment, with its consequent depletion of funds and will probably attempt mediation, through either the Trades Union Congress or the ^Council of Action5&apos;.Should a strike occur the attitude of postal workers and of trade unionists connected with the Press will require careful attention.Public opinion is firmly on the side of theGovernment but endue emphasis cannot be laid upon the-fact that- any sighs-of rtomVromlse. oh&apos; the part of the Government -will herald a situation of gravityunparalleled in xfoa labour movement.
THB &quot;COUNCIL OP ACTION&quot;The National Council of Action has not had a happyweek.   On the one hand, the progress of events in Polandhas upset their calculations and on the other there is reason to believe that the Russian Delegation, who may he regarded as the founders of the Council, are dissatisfied!with its somewhat ineffective rBle.   It is clear that thelformation of the Council was the work of professional     Jrevolutionaries of great ability, who seized upon thegeneral fear of mobilisation as their opportunity;   theamateur British extremists would have missed this opportmas they have missed others.   In order, possibly torehabilitate itself, the Council issued, on August 28th, a manifesto in which it declared inter alia that:&quot;It may still he necessary to prevent a continuation of open or disguised warfare against Soviet Russia, and we may, therefore, have to resort to a partial or complete stoppage of labour.   The sands are running out and the cell for action may be issued at any moment...We have utilised arguments and persuasion - only to be met by evasion and subterfuge on the part of the representatives of the British Government.   We call upon the workers, therefore, to hold themselves in readiness for any call to action which may be made.&quot;Be warned - Be ready and prepare for any contingency that may arise.&quot;The opinions expressed regarding the &quot;Council ofAction by certain labour men, who have consistentlysupported Soviet Russia, are interesting at this juncture,On August 25th Mr. Ivlalone expressed himself as follows toa personal friend:&quot;Prom what I have seen of them the Councils of Action, both local and national, should be now termed &apos;Councils of Inaction&apos;; they are mostly in the hands of reactionary labour parliamentarian place seekers.   The most they want is a General Election.   The danger of their lethargy is that the Government will force an election on the mines issue first. .
M    Q    M4&quot;The Council of Action should call for reports from all local councils asking for earliest possible, date for strike, replies to be sent by return of mail, when received the National Council of Action to fix a definite date for a strike to begin.&quot;You should urge all local &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committees to agitate wherever possible; in Liverpool for example I know the Labour placemen are having sleepless nights *   I presume you will try and bring things to a head by the Trades Union Congress of September 6 th.&quot;Professor Gooae wrote on August 25th:&quot;I spent all day yesterday working with Grenfell on the Russian situation.  We produced some effect.   The situation is rapidly becoming oritioal both there and here.   It is a thousand pities that the whole business is crossed by ths coal strike.   Use will be made of this to direct attention from the other.   The Council of Action sat a long time yesterdayt..it is evident that the Powers would like it to become the Counoil of Inaction - a fading away sort of thing.&quot;Mr. C.T. Cramp is apparently of opinion that caremust be taken to prevent the usurpation of Trade Unionrights hy the various prc-Bolshevik organisations.   Herecently addressed the following protest to the &quot;Handsoff Russia&quot; Committee:&quot;I understand that you have recently issued a circular advisirg the miners to hold up the ooal for Prance as aV; means of assisting Russia during this crisis.  As you are well aware, I favour anything which can be done to cripple the attacks upon Russia at this or any other time, but this is being translated as an undue Interference with the executive rights of- otker trade unions ana was * adversely commented upon at the meeting of the Council of Action whioh I attended last evening. In view of the fact that my name, together with that of others,, appears on the notepaper and will probably be used by the capitalist press for their own purposes I would suggest that at this time the !Hands off Russia1 Committee might allow its activities to be absorbed by the Council of Action.   If that body should fail to.bring about the result for which the 1 Hands off Russia1 Committee was brought into being, then I think we might resume activities, but there, is a great &quot; .   danger of creating divisions in the ranis oflabour if there.are two policies being pursued at the same time.&quot; -    .The following are passages, from the circular to whichMir. Cramp refers: vl..
- &quot;The peace terms offered by Soviet Russia to Poland are so generous that the v/orst enemies of the working class Government of Russia are astounded at their leniency.&quot;But the shirkers and loafers, viz., the big financiers, who control French foreign policy are still detormined that the manufacture of Russian widows and orphans must continue.&quot;French financiers are the foulest gang of child murderers that have yet cursed this earth, compared with them Herod of the New Testament was a kind-hearted old gentleman.&quot;Is British Labour to continue helping these sooundrels to pursue their foul course?&quot;We hope the reply will be &apos;a roaring HO.1   fflot a second longer.1&quot;British Labour can spike the guns of these inhuman ruffians with very little effort by stopping the coal supply to Prance.-  &quot;The National 1Hands off Russia1 Committee urges all local bodies co-operating with the National Council of Action to pass resolutions, without a momentt&amp; delay and send them to the National Council of Action (33, iSccleston Square, London, 3.W.1,) requesting that body to issue instructions for the stoppage of all coal for France; until Prance withdraws all aid from Poland, makes peace with Russia and recognises the Soviet Government.&quot;Down with the French financiers and ImperialistsI&quot; Addressing a meeting, for which 2,500 people paidadmission, at Manchester on August  9th, Mr, Pureell said;*&quot;In 8 ite of all the horrible tales about Russia, I should be quite willing to be deported back to Russia to-night.   Some of us are of the opinion that we should have done in this country very much like what the Russians have done in Russia.&quot;I believe in. the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, but if the workers&apos; in this country overthrow Capitalism, they must set up an armed proletariat,Ir there is bloodshed it will be because the Capitalists resist.  We have sent a message to the Russian people that we are trying to overthrow our own Government.&quot;I am glad to belong to the 1 Council of Action1 in this country.   I am satisfied we have prevented war.Aeroplanes were to.be sent to Poland from Hendon. but theae have been held up, but the French are supplying Poland with arms.&quot;Unless Lloyd George tables the peace terms we have still the General Strike left.   It is my business to encourage you to be prepared at this moment.   Be ready so that every piece of industry, so far as you are concerned, shall cease,   I plead with you in the name of my own class - the working class.&quot;
The looal councils of action appear still to be gaining ground; extremists throughout the country are alive to their potentialities and are straining every nerve to capture the machinery.   They do not place much reliance onthe National Council, the moderate members of which they describe as &quot;no more dangerous than a litter of white mice,&quot;but &quot;the history of revolutions is full of instanoos of developments initiated by moderate men being carried to an extent to which those people never dreamed.&quot;John McLean has endeavoured to form a Communist Council of Action in his ovm district, and on August 28th collected 75-people, who were said to represent the International Union of Ex-Service Men, the Socialist Labour Party, the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Communist Group and the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee.   It is doubtful if McLeans efforts in this direction will have any tangible result, although many of his extremist followers were present at the meeting.In Birmingham there is some opposition in co-operative circles to the existing connection between the local Council of Action and the Co-operative Society.   The members of the latter complain that they have not been consulted.THE RUSSIAN TRADING DiffiSOATIOflIt is not too much to say that the Russian Trading Delegation has become a greater menace to the stability of this country than anything that has happened since the Armistice.   It will be remembered that every member of the Delegation undertook or subscribed to an undertaking not to interfere in politics in this country or to give interviews to the Press.   For about three weeks they kepttheir undertaking, but about the middle of June they arranged for subsidising the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and thereafter the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; became their organ.   After the arrival of Eameneff they conducted their campaign for secretlyundermining the morale of tho country with consummate jv ability/
ability,   Thoy exploited the fear of mobilisation, they engineered the formation of the Council of Action, which Kaiaeneff himself attended, they have been in daily communication with the leaders of the Council and thoy even dictated the terms of the Council&apos;s manifesto.   Besides subsidising the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; they subsidised revolutionary organs such as &quot;The Call&quot; (now &quot;The Communist&quot;) and the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and they engineered the formation of the United Communist Party.   Theodore Rothstein, who was not a member of the Delegation at all, but attached himself to it, used the opportunity of the passage given to him in a destroyer to attempt to undermine the loyalty of the erew,   He has been refused leave to return to England afcd now the Delegation is applying pressure to secure him the necessary visa.   District Councils of Action have been set up in all the dockyards and elsewhere and attempts are being made to undermine the loyalty of the Army Service Corps.   Without their monetary help the extremist organs would have ceased from appearing, the Communist Party would not bave been formed and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; *ould have been in danger of collapsing for lack of support.   With every day the Delegation is extending its roots and will be more difficult to dislodge.   If a serious crisis arises and there is rioting and bloodshed it will be due to the sinister influences of the Russian Delegation, which was invited to this country for the purpose of trade and which has practically failed to do any considerable business and is now, on instructions from Mosoow, devoting all its energy to revolutionary propaganda.Kameneff has telegraphed to Moscow for permission to leave England to-morrow on the ground that there is not enough to do.  He is ready to make his absence temporary; his motive is not yet apparent.JPHE/t A
387.1IEHB FORTHCOMING TRfflj UNION OftNGKaiSSThe Trade Union Congress, vh ich meets at Portsmouth . . from September 6th to 11th, is specially important.   In common with most Labour conferences it will have before it resolutions and amendments covering not only the whole field of the movement, but matters as apparently inconsequent as the relations between.Marine bandsmen and civilian musicians and the overcrowding of buses and tramcars.The most important resolution on the agenda is thatrelating to the General Staff for Labour.   This embodiesthe scheme outlined in my Report No. 63 of 15.7.20. andfurther proposes that:(a)    The General Council shall *keep a watch on all ... industrial movements, and shall attempt, where possible, to co-ordinate industrial action.- (b)    It shall promote common action by the Trade Union --&apos; movement on general questions&apos;, such as wages and hours of labour, and any matter of general concern that may arise between Trade Unio.ri&apos;3 and employers or between the Trade Union movement,and the Government,, and shall have power to assist any union which is attacked on any. vital question of Trade Union principle. . &apos;.-  -.    (c)    Where disputes arise, or threaten tc arise*between Trade Unions it shall use its influence to promote a settlement.(d) It shall assist Trade Unions in the work of organisation, and shall carry on propaganda with a&apos;   vieTr tc strengthening&apos;tae industrial side of the move-ment, and Icr the attainment of any&apos;.or all of the above objects.(e) It shall also enter into relations with the TradeUnion end Labour movements in other countries with, a view to promoting common action and internationalsolidarity*     -Although this is the official resolution, tabled by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, the Warehouse and General Workers1 Union advocates the creation of an &quot;Industrial Parliament of Labour&quot; which would fulfil
&quot;the growing desire for industrial adjustment on a national basis&quot;, effect the co-ordination of labour&apos;s claims and *seoure &quot;a united Labour voice on many important principlesof practical industrial reform.&quot;In order &quot;to make Congress resolutions more effective&quot;the National Union of Bailwaymen will move:&quot;That, in view of the fact that Congress resolutions are not usually put into operation, although carried by overwhelming majorities, this Congress decide to appoint a Special Committee to conduct an inquiry aB to how far the Trades Union Congress can be made a useful body giving effect to the aspirations of the members in the country.&quot;The Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilderswill give vent to their displeasure with the inefficaoyof Congress resolutions in the following resolution:&quot;That the method of furthering Congress resolutions by deputations to Ministers is becoming less effective year by year, and is now almost obsolete.   This Congress therefore instructs the Parliamentary Committee to consult the Labour Party Executive on resolutions requiring political action, and jointly decide On the methods for furthering them.   On resolutions of an industrial character, the Parliamentary Committee shall consult the unions concerned and decide on the steps to be taken.&quot;The engineers and the dockers will move respectively, that responsibility for unemployment shall be borne by industry, and by industry and the State.A &quot;minimum income for all&quot;, the &quot;amalgamation of all trades&quot; (in other words the f0ne Big Union1) equal pay for men and women in the Civil Service, (but not, apparently, in industry), and &quot;the exemption of trade unions funds from taxation&quot; are the subjects of other resolutions.The National Union of Journalists will move an amendment oalling on the Executives of affiliated trade unions to prohibit the growing practice of trade union officials and other Labour leaders competing with professipnal journalists in supplying, for gain, news to newspapers andnews/

On this discussion will hinge the question whether the Council of Aotion will be converted or absorbed into a &quot;General Staff for Labour&quot; or whether it will continue to be the executive body of the Trade Union Congress, which hitherto has had no executive power and can only register expressions of opinion. In either case, we must be prepared for a permanent body not acting on the peaceful lines as did the Negotiating Committee in the Railway Strike, but as a sort of Central Soviet.It is not without interest to note the strength of the various groups as officially tabulated, the figures being based on the delegation levies actually paid:
W SjjjjtlMjSgRIgG industry the position in this industry is, at present, unchanged.   The Manchester District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has refused to comply with the orders of the National Executive to remove the embargo on overtime.   Dissatisfaction among the rank and file is becoming increasingly manifest and the national officials are so deeply engaged with the affairs of their own union that they will not willingly support the electricians, thereby depleting the funds which may be needed for their own struggle. . Strong forces are working for the settlement of the Electrical Trades Union dispute.ML IMG AMONG BI-SBBVICB jjgNOn August .29th the Trafalgar Square meeting indicated the growing bitterness in.the ranks of ex-Service men. The attendance was estimated at 3,000, but half this number were.casual spectators.   The meeting was frankly revolutionary and the more violent remarks were well- received by the first 25&apos; - 30 rows ox the audience who were present throughout the meeting.   Robert Williams, who described himself as a &quot;friend and colleague of Kameneff&quot;,. urged that the best of the&apos; ex-Service men * g. propagandists should&apos; go to the&apos; &quot;barracks of the Horse, Foot Guards, Artillery, Cavalry and Police and secure them as members of the National Union of      Service lien&quot;.   His. :speech was- virulent rather than convincing.Prank Hodges put the miners&apos; case with considerable ability and was appreciated by his audience, who did not appear to contrast his comfortable bourgeois appearance witli his description of the arduous life of a miner, or with the poverty stricken air of their own speakers.
The resolution, declared to be passed by&apos;&quot;unanimous&quot; acclaim, although half the audience made no sound, demanded immediate peace with Ireland and Russia, full recognition of the Soviet Government and pledged support to the miners in their coming struggle.There is discontent regarding the alleged reduction of disablement pensions and the Ton Pentre and Ystrad branch of the &quot;Comrades of the Great ftar&quot; has sent a resolution of protest to local Mambers of Parliament.In Leicester and Coventry unemployment among ex-Servicemen is acute and agitators are taking full advantage ofthis fact.   On August 86th the chairman of the Stoke Heathbranch of the National Union of Bx-Service Men read a&quot;confidential&quot; letter from headquarters in which it was stated that all the doctors engaged by tho Government toexamine ex-Service men with-reference to their disability pensions had been called to London for the purpose ofattending a four days&apos;conference; the object of this conference was to endeavour to stop all disability pensions;where possible, and the doctors had already been promised 2.2.0. a head for each ox-Service nwn, at present drawinga pension, whom they now certified as &quot;fit.&quot;    There is little doubt that the author of this preposterous statement is,   A. E. Mender, the General Secretary,My correspondent states that tho unemployed ex-Servicemen in Leicester (about. 600). now form up in the Market place and march through the main street to the office of theDistress Committee and Labour Exchange.   Sx-non-commisslonedoff icers parade the men and give the necessary, orders whilston the march.    In Nottinghamshire tuere are nearly 2,000unemployed ax-Service men.TRS RiaPOHT 0? TBS BRITISH LABOUR yo HUSSIAThe Labour Party has just issued the final report of theBritish/
British Labour Delegation to Russia.   It is an apologia for rather than a vindication of Bolshevism; it   states that &quot;most accounts of Soviet Russia which we have seen in the Capitalist Press of our own country proved to be perversions of the fact&quot;, but admits &quot;a widespread break-down in the transport system, with deplorable economic consequences&quot;, and an iron dictatorship and suppression of personal freedom, in comparison with which the &quot;Capitalist&quot; regime of this country must appear Utopian.BRITISH INDIAHS AMD SOVIET russia correspondent, who returned with Indian students and an Australian from the Eid-uz-2uhar festival at Woking,sends the following report of their conversation:&quot;Mahomed Ibrahim Ghosh of Delhi, waxed very warm, denouncing the British Government and all Anglo-Indian officials, and deolared that the future of India must be an alliance with the Bolshevists, with the formation of a Soviet Government in India, so that India could be governed independently of England.   He said 11 have to-day had a conversation with Mahomed Ali, whom all we young men regard as a patriot and a leader of public opinion in India; he says we must look to Afghanistan, but I told him &apos;No*, we must look still further Horth, to Soviet Russia, and when I said that, Mahomed Ali replied, ,    *You are a man of prescience; that will come after-wards, but we must look to Afghanistan first.1   The Australian then said, &apos;But England has much to teach you, if not, why do you young men come to England?&apos; Whereupon Amin-ul-Haq replied, fWe come here to learn because, owing to English influences, we oannot get employment in India unless we have had an English education and training.   That is one/of the things we complain of, we ought to be able to get all this in our own country without the expense of coming to England; further, when we do come here every obstacle is put in our way by the India Office officials.1 Qszi Fazil-Rahman said he and others had been waiting for two months without getting into a college, and if something did not come along soon they intended to proceed to America, and when they returned to India tell their relatives the treatment they had got in England.   Rahman said he did not want to mix himself up in politics; his father had always been a loyalist, but the treatment he had received here ha4 been sufficient to make anyone disloyal,&quot;      u- ,
15330MR, C.T, CRAMP.On August 28nd Mr, C, T, Cramp made a speech of some Importance at Long Eaton.   Commenting on the organisation of the National Union of Railwaymen, he said, that the time had come for a certain amount of devolution within the union and suggested that District Councils should he given some responsibility.   He believed also that the time wauld come when they would evolve from the National Union of Railwaymen into a great Transport Workers&apos; Union, linking up all and every grade engaged in transport by road, rail and sea. &quot;Then there would be no escape for our friends the capitalists, which ever way they may turn,&quot;Supporting the Council of Action, Mr. Cramp said   that he was a believer in direct action, but that it should be used when ordinary methods were not available.   The present Government had no mandate to do many of the mad things they had done.   The only way to stop such.a Government was by direct aotion.   If left to him he would use any and every means to bring such a Government down.   Since the day when they gulled the people to electing them they had descended to some of the most despicable tricks to evade their duty. He believed that th*y would collapse &quot;by their own inherent rottenness,&quot;REVOLUTIONARY TALKIt is remarkable that, with all the unrest in the oountry, there has rarely been a disloyal utterance against His Majesty,   For almost the first time-&quot;it is reported from Glasgow that among the extremists one of the principal topics of conversation is the treatment that the Proletariat will mete out to. the King,   In Sinn Fein circles in Glasgow this is also freely discussed, together with the declared determination that if the Lord Uayor of Cork dies reprisalswill/
** 1(3 *&quot;*will &quot;be taken from members of the Cabinet.   It is impossible  1 to say how far these threats would be interpreted into action., There have always been such rumours among the Irish Sinn Feiners but the danger of the present situation is that the idle threats may inspire some fanatio to sacrifice his life with a perverted sense of patriotism.   It is unnecessary to say that every possible precaution is being taken.SINN FSIB m great britain during the week interest has centred in the case of the Lord Mayor of Cork.   Apart from Sinn Fein circles, Labour and the general public, which show extraordinary apathy towards events in Ireland, have inclined towards sympathy with the prisoner.   This fact it: attributable in part to the attitude of the Press.Demonstrations have been held outside Brixton prison and on August 24th and 25th the numbers were estimated at between fifteen and twenty thousand,   The temper of ,many of the demonstrators, particularly ex-Service men, was ugly and reprisals against members of the Government were freely threatened.   Sinn Peiners generally are incensed by the inaction of the official Labour movement and Mr. Lansbury was severely heckled in this sense by Irishmen at a Mile End meeting on August 28th.   Protest meetings against the treatment of Dr, Mannix are still being held and on August 26th a mass demonstration at Wigan was attended by about 1,000 people.IRELANDExternally conditions during the week have become worse and serious oases of rioting and arson have occurred at Belfast, Lisbum, Dromore and Dundalk.   The murder of District Inspector Swanzy on August 22nd led to an outbreak of rioting and burning of houses in Lisbum and a very large portion of the twm waswrecked/
wrecked and burned.   On the morning of August 25th the rioting spread to Belfast and led to renewed&apos; disturbances; some houses were fired in the Llountpottinger area and on iiu^ust 28th there was serious rioting, which continued during the evening and night.   Firearms were freely used and troops and police were compelled to return the fire.   Five persons are known to have been, killed and it is believed that a largenumber were injured,&apos; some fatally.   The city is still in a mostdisturbed condition,   Reprisals were taken on the property of Protestants in Dun&amp;alk, and several houses have been set on fire and three lives have apparently been lost as a result.It is to be feared that this destruction may extend to theproperty of isolated loyalists in the South and ?/est.Of the 2315 outrages reported, 197 were directly attribut-able to Sinn Fein, 10,were due to agrarian motives and 26 were miscellaneous offences.   16 attacks were made on.the police, four police barracks were attacked, five vacated Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks, two courthouses, one Revenue Office and two coastguard stations were burned. , There were 35 cases of robbery of mails and other acts of highway robbery, end 22 cases of raiding for arms by masked and armed men.   Intimidation was rampant.

Sinn Fein appears unable to collect the local rates,i Vratepayers asserting that under a Republic there ought to be no rates.   A very difficult situation has arisen and many county and district/
district oounoils are becoming unable to pay their armies of officials and banks are not unnaturally refusing further credit.   This will yet prove a most serious obstacle to Sinn Fein.Indications are not wanting that the leaders know that the game is up and that If they are firmly dealt with during the next few weeks they will be anxious to come to a settle-ment.   No doubt the fury with which they have conducted , outrages recently is designed to put them into a better position for negotiating., The railway situation remains unchanged but there is growing dissatisfaction amongst employees who have been suspended or dismissed for refusing to carry troops and police Sinn Fein seems unable to pay those who are out of employment and is moat anxious that their number should not increase. Subscriptions are coming in very slowly.There is no other serious labour trouble at present but the whole condition of the country both politically and industrially is bad.The French Government has given Gavan Duffy, the Sinn Fein &quot;Ambassador&quot; in Paris, notice to leave within twenty-four hours.
