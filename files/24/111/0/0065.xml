5 &apos;.....i ;&quot;&quot;TKirvt is basis rruperiy UICirculated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.3 Government.4 93&quot;I think my colleagues may be interested to read this speech delivered by Ahmad Pasha Sanaa, at a meeting of the Council of Notables, Gazara, Mesopotamia on 22nd June 1920.\*\\ E. S. M.ember 1920.wish to draw your attention to the following words before commencing the meeting. You have all come to know of the recent disturbances which are taking place at Baghdad in the name of the so-called demand of rights. It is known to every man of common sense what these disturbances will cause and what result they will lead to. I therefore do not see that it is a good thing to keep silent at this stage. I also believe that it is the duty of, every patriot to express his opinion openly in this respect, especially at the time when the Government of Occupation have made several promises and open announcements not through fear but through love of their good intentions towards the welfare of. our country and ourselves. Everyone of us has noticed that from the time of occupation up to now, the Government is trying its utmost, in the way of our comfort and the development of our country, and by its enterprise doing the most important improvements as time permits and opportunity occurs, in spite of the trouble accruing from this war which has surprised the whole world. He who reads the Eastern and Western papers and comes to knew what difficulties this war has created, especially the problem of peace with Turkey, cannot but appreciate this Government of Occupation in view of what she has done in these critical times of great works leading to the improvement of this country. These works are as apparent as tho mid-day sun. He cannot also but excuse her for not completing the remainder of her promises and allow her sufficient time to do what is neces-sary of the important things, until the time comes when all difficulties and hindrances which may be stumbling stones in her way are rooted out, for &quot; slow and steady wins the race.&quot;We people of Basrah wish for all that there is in the way of the improvement and development of the country, but we are excused if we declare openly that we do not agree to impracticable demands and that we fully believe that this Government will execute her promises in her earliest possible time.We are thankful to her first and last for all her care in all what leads to our comfort and improvement of the country. As I have no doubt that you agree with me in all what I have said, and believe as I believe, that these are facts, I request the President of the Council to submit these expressions to His Excellency the Civil Commissioner, so that he may know the ideas of the Basrah people.2275-1     100  9.20
