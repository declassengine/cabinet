PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.Attention has again been concentrated during the week upon the coal situation. On the 16th September the miners&apos; executive put forward a series of proposals with a view to a settlement, and prolonged discussions with the President of the Board of Trade ensued on the 16th, the 17th, and the 20th. The miners&apos; revised position is that, in return for the immediate concession of their wages demand, they withdraw into the background their demand as to prices, and are willing to take part in a full inquiry with a view to increasing output and absorbing into new standard rates the various flat rate advances made in recent years. The Government, however, are only willing to grant such immediate ad-vances as may be recommended by a court of inquiry on the wages demands, and the miners have so far refused to consider the question of going to arbitration. The discussions, therefore, which began on the 16th September ended without result, The national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation, on the 21st September, approved the attitude of their executive. A further stage in the negotiations, however, was opened on the 22nd, with a full delegate meeting of the Triple Alliance, and a meeting between the Prime Minister and representatives of the Alliance, together with the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation.  These latter negotiations are all still proceeding.There is little doubt that the statistical summary issued by the Board of Trade, giving output costs and revenue figures for the coalmining industry for the three months ending the 30th June, has had some effect in causing the miners to revise their demands. On the other hand, the publication of the Labour Gazette cost-of-living figure for the 1st September showed an increase of 6 points in the average level of retail prices ; this has been used as a further argument in support of the miners&apos; claim for increased wages.In view of the situation which will arise should the strike notices become operative, a resolution adopted by the Standing Orders Committee of the London Labour Conference, attached to the Ministry of Food, is of importance. The resolution urges the Labour move-ment to co-operate in assisting the Ministry of Food to carry out their functions as to the distribution of food, and expresses the opinion that the Ministry of Food should maintain a strictly neutral attitude in the dispute, restricting their efforts wholly to the distribution of the people&apos;s food. rThe only other events of the week requiring reference are the close of the printers&apos; dispute in Manchester and Liverpool, and the outbreak of a dispute in the spinning section of the cotton textile industry.A national conference to discuss wages has been arranged to take place on the 23rd September between the engineering employers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 10th September was 150,972, made up of 150,402 lodged by men and 570 by women. On the 3rd September there were 146,451 policies current, 145,874 for men and 577 for women.On the 10th September, 92,506 unemployment books, 63,728 for males and 28,778 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Corn-pared with the previous week, when there were 59,668 books lodged by males and 27,292 by females, the total increase is 5,546. .  &apos;The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 389.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics,Labour and Ireland. The depletion of staff consequent on the dismissal of railwaymen who have refused to transport munitions, armed soldiers, or police, is necessitating the sus-, pension of railway services in some areas.The position in the Belfast shipyards remains unchanged. The proposal of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Ltd., for a conference with the local district council of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation has proved abortive.Further evidence is to hand of the separatist developments of Irish trade unionism to which reference was made last week. At a recent conference in Dublin, at which delegates from all parts of the country were present, a provisional committee was formed with a view to the establishment of an Irish Typographical Union.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.-A special meeting of the general council of the Scottish Clerks&apos; Association was held in Glasgow on the 18th September to consider the advisability of working the Unemployment Insurance Act on behalf of business assistants. A resolution was passed unanimously agreeing to operate the State scheme.Finance Act, 1920.-The special conference summoned to determine the policy of the co-operative movement in connection with the Corporation Profits Tax under the Finance Act, 1920, was held at Preston on the 15th September. The official policy, which was endorsed by the conference, amounts practically to a decision to accept the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ suggestion to submit an alternative scheme to that pro-posed by the Government, and, meanwhile, to use every possible means to agitate for the repeal of the tax, so far as it affects co-operative societies. Although this moderate official policy was endorsed, it is significant that an amendment, submitted by a number of societies, urging that the co-operative movement as a whole should defy the law and refuse tcrpay the tax, received 1,055 votes as compared with 1,912 votes in favour of the official resolution. The conference instructed their committee that the proposals put forward as alternatives must in any case provide for the exemption of all surplus arising from mutual trading, and must be approved by at least a two-thirds majority of the societies voting upon them.Dockers : Court of Inquiry. It will be recalled that the agreement of the 5th May, between the-National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Council of Port Labour Employers, provided for the coming into immediate operation of the recommen-dations of Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry with regard to wages, and left over for further negotiation the questions of registration, maintenance during unemployment and under-employment, the weekly payment of wages, the working of shifts, and the establishment of-a Joint Council for the industry. Mr. Bevin has prepared for the Joint Negotiating Committee a memorandum on the first four questions, which has been approved by a sub-committee of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation.Mr. Bevin deals with the fourth question first, and maintains that, owing to the nature of employment at the docks, the establishment of a complete shift system is unnecessary and impracticable. Weekly payment of wages, registration, and maintenance during unemployment are recommended; and it is urged that, for the proper administration of these schemes, steps should be taken immediately to induce the Government to provide clearing houses and other machinery.Three methods of dealing with the problem of maintenance are discussed, namely, by the application of the National Insurance (Unemployment) Acts ; by contracting out of the Acts, and arranging for a fixed daily payment when a man is not employed ; and by the establishment of a guaranteed minimum for all sections of dock workers, whether employed or not. The last is selected as the most suitable, the other two being discarded in view of the varied conditions at the docks and the irregularity of dock employment. A guaranteed minimum of  4 a Week is proposed, and the details of the scheme are worked out in full. It is proposed that the cost of administration should be divided between the Government and the industry, the Government undertaking to provide a sum ai least equal to the amount for which they would be liable under the Unemployment Insurance Act, leaving the balance required to make up the  4 guaranteed weekly minimum as a charge upon the industry. It is estimated that the cost to the industry would be  2,572,251 per annum.- Mr. Bevin is now devoting a considerable amount of time - to propaganda on behalf of this scheme. He made speeches on the subject at Gloucester on the 17th September, at Bristol on the 19th, and at Gravesend on the 22nd.
25.9.20.384Industrial and Other Organisations.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation-A special delegate meeting of this federation was held at Cardiff on the 13th and 14th September, under the presidency of Mr. W. Brace, M.P., to consider the revision of the rules of the federation. The following additions to the objects of the federation received- the sanction of the conference:-that the membership be extended so as to include colliery officials, master hauliers and traffic managers, a&apos;s well as ordinary colliery workers ; that the federation seek &quot; to secure by industrial and, legislative action a working day of six hours from bank to bank; &quot; and that victimisation in all forms, whether by prevention of obtaining work or prosecution in the courts, should, be strenuously resisted, even to the extent of national action.With regard to the position of officials, a resolution was carried that the general secretary should be a full-time servant of the federation and that he should not be allowed to hold the position of member of Parliament. The adoption of this rule does not now affect Mr. 1. Richards, as he has already resigned his seat in the House of Commons. It was agreed that all conference delegates should be paid from the central fund, and that the general secretary should convene delegate conferences at the earliest possible date after receiving requests from 20 lodges.Municipal Employees&apos; Association. The 26th annual meeting of this association opened at Newcastle on the 14th September. The chief business consisted in the alteration of rules. With regard to the collection of the political levy, a proposal was carried that, instead of each member contributing Id. a month, a grant should be made out of the general funds, and that any member who objected to the political levy could withdraw his share at the end of the year. Increased contributions were recommended with a view to the doubling of benefits. &quot; Whitley Councils &quot; were criticised because of the heavy expenses entailed on trade unions.Trade Union Topics.National Union of Clerks. The executive of the union have passed two resolutions with reference to the Draft Conventions adopted by the Washington International Labour Conference. The first, which apparently refers to Clause 2 of the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill, protests against the proposal &quot; to introduce, under cover of an International Convention, legislation not required by that Convention, which would in effect lessen the protection conferred by existing legislation on the workers concerned.&quot; The second calls attention to the fact that the period of one year allowed under the Peace Treaty for action upon Conventions has very nearly expired, and that, so far, nothing has apparently been done to ratify the Convention concerning the employment of women before and after childbirth. In this connection, it will be remembered that the British Government delegates at the Conference abstained from voting on this Convention.National Society of Tailors&apos; Cutters. The City of Liverpool Society of Foremen Tailors has recently been re-constituted on a national basis under the title of the National Society of Tailors&apos; Cutters.  The headquarters will remain at Liverpool.Actors&apos; Association. At a meeting of the association on the 19th September it was decided to discontinue the dramatic side of the association^ employment agency, which has been run at a considerable financial loss, but to continue the cinema side for another six months. The meeting also passed a resolution that there was no need for the formation of a separate cinema artists&apos; union.Ex-Service Men.Employment of Ex-Service Men. In furtherance of the national campaign for the final re-settlement of ex-Service men, meetings were held at Bristol, on the 15th September, at Birmingham, on the 16th, and in London on the 17th. At the London meeting, at Montagu House, it was agreed to set up a Standing Joint Committee, as suggested by the Lord Mayor of London, to be concerned in the first instance with disabled men and ex-officers.The Bristol meeting showed only a limited response by employers to the Lord Mayors invitation. Major Wilson Fox, of the Ministry of Labour, stated that if one-third of the employers of Bristol would take but one man each, it would practically clear the local register. Mr. E. H. C. Wethered pointed out that the problem was com-plicated by the fact that the traders of Bristol did not seem able to absorb the number of
juveniles leaving school. It was decided to take measures to approach all employers with regard to the absorption of local men unemployed, and, if it was found that this absorption could not be effected, to acquaint the Government with the position as soon as possible. At the Birmingham meeting a resolution was adopted regretting the decision of the Government not to use some of the national factories for the purpose of tailoring and boot-making for the Services.A conference of delegates from all the Metropolitan boroughs, on the question of unem-ployment among ex-Service men and others, was held at Deptford on the 17th September, the Mayor of Deptford presiding. A resolution was carried calling upon the Government to open national workshops, to reclaim foreshores and to undertake afforestation. A committee was elected, consisting of all the mayors present, and representatives of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, the Comrades of the Great War, the National Union of Ex-Service Men, and the London Trades Council, to present the resolution to the Prime Minister, and to arrange for a procession of the unem-ployed to accompany them to Downing Street.Committee on the Re-Employment of Ex-Service Men. The committee appointed &quot; to consider the best means of facilitating the re-employment of ex-Service men, and to make recommendations to the Minister of Labour with regard thereto,&quot; published an interim report on the 15th September. After drawing attention to the broad features of the situation as regards the industrial re-absorption of ex-Service men, they point out that the residue of ex-Service &quot;men remaining unemployed is comparatively small, and that different methods must be adopted to meet the special requirements of each group, varying according to age, experience and physical capacity. They feel strongly that a considerable advance could be made by extending the Government training scheme to young non-disabled men whom the war deprived of the opportunity of establishing themselves in a definite vocation. They are satisfied that employers in general have fulfilled their obligations with regard to the reinstatement of ex-Service men formerly in their employment, but state that this is not universally the case, particularly in regard to shop assistants. Trade unions also have been largely instrumental in bringing this about, and, moreover, have been willing, in general, to co-operate in opening new avenues of employment for disabled men. Certain of the cases in which this co-operation has appeared insufficient have received the consideration of the committee, as, for example, the furnishing trade ; the sheet metal trade ; the introduction of trainees on bricklayers&apos; work at Bristol; the wagon building industry ; and the dispute at the works of the Campbell Gas Engine Co., Ltd., arising from the engagement of ex-Service men for training in engineering. The committee suggest that building and moulding offer opportunities for the employment of ex-Service men. Eecommendations are also made with regard to the National Scheme for the Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men, and the settlement of ex-Service men on agricultural small-holdings. The following sentence is italicized in the report: &quot; We believe that, whatever national scheme may be adopted, the re-employment of individual ex-Service men must ultimately be effected by means of local arrangements, and that the success obtained by [Local Employment] Committees will largely depend upon the amount of personal effort which individual members are prepared to devote to the details of their task.&quot;Amalgamation of Ex-Service Organisations. Eepresentatives of the Officers&apos; Associa-tion, the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers, the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers and the Comrades of the Great War met in conference on the 18th September to consider the draft constitution prepared by the Drafting Committee set up by the Conference of 7th August. *Amongst the aims and objects of the amalgamation, as stated in this draft constitution, are the encouragement of the claims of ex-Service men to employment, and. the enlistment of the co-operation of employers and trade unions for this purpose ; the support of suitable undertakings for the training and employment of ex-Service men; the prevention of the employment of ex-Service men at less than the recognised standard rates of wages; the securing of adequate pensions, allowances, grants and war gratuities for ex-Service men and their dependants; and the representation of the needs of ex-Service men and their dependants in Parliament and on all public bodies whose functions are defined by Act of Parliament. It is also laid down that nothing in the constitution shall prevent the society from adopting and declaring a definite policy on any public question, and taking any action considered necessary in pursuance of it, provided that the matter has been considered and endorsed by a majority of the branches of the organisation.
The conference decided to institute a women&apos;s section, under rules subsequently to be published, which would include. ex-Service women and the wives and near relations of ex-Service men.It now remains for each organisation to call a national conference to approve the draft constitution.International Relations of Labour.International Labour Office.-In, accordance with the resolution adopted by the Washington International Labour Conference (1919), the Governing Body of the Inter-national Labour Office have constituted an International Emigration Commission, with Viscount Cave (Great Britain) as chairman and M. Louis Varlez (International Labour Office) as secretary. *This Commission is composed of 18 members, consisting of six employers&apos; delegates, six workers&apos; delegates and six Government delegates ; nine of the 18 members are appointed by European Governments and nine by Governments outside Europe. The International Labour Office have already issued a questionnaire asking for information on the actual position of emigration and immigration in the various countries ; existing legislation and regulations, and indications of general policy adopted by each State; and &quot; certain questions which the Commission will probably wish to examine and con-stitute the real object of the Washington resolution.&quot;Under the last heading, the questionnaire enumerates the problems which might be studied by the Commission^ and the tasks which might ultimately be entrusted to the International Labour Office. The members of the organisation are asked to forward their observations with regard to this enumeration, which includes, inter alia, the establishment of uniform statistical schemes relating to the movement of international migration, and of regular communication to the International Labour Office of information relating to migration and the treatment of foreign workers. In addition, the Commission will consider not only the regulation of migration, but also the measures necessary for insuring effective protection to emigrants and immigrants against all kinds of exploitation.The Governing Body have also referred to the consideration of the Commission, and placed as the first item in their agenda the question of the equality of treatment of foreign workers. In this connection the questionnaire draws attention to the recommendation of the Washington Conference concerning reciprocity of treatment of foreign workers, and to Art. 3 of the Draft Convention concerning Unemployment. The Commission will submit their report to the International Labour Conference at Geneva next year.The work of collecting and preparing the replies of the British Government has been referred to the Ministry of Labour, and, in this connection, a preliminary Inter-departmental Conference took place at Montagu House on the 22nd September, under the chairmanship of Sir Montague Barlow, K.B.E., M.P., Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour. At this conference the distribution of work was finally agreed upon, and arrangements made to enable the British Government to submit its replies within the time limit specified.International Federation of Agricultural Wor hers.-An account of the international congress of agricultural workers&apos; organisations, held at Amsterdam from the 17th to the 20th August, has already appeared in this Report.f Further details are now to hand in the report to the executive committee of the National Union of Agricultural Workers of the union&apos;s delegates to the conference. The Congress discussed the attitude to be adopted by the Federation towards the programme of the International Conference and drew up a list of demands to be placed before the Conference. Special emphasis was laid on the 8-hour dav.The headquarters of the Federation will be at the central offices of the Dutch union in Amsterdam. M. Hiemstra, secretary of the Dutch union, was appointed secretary of the International, and Mr. W. R. Smith, president of the National Union of Agri-cultural Workers, was chosen by the executive committee as its first president.The question of land ownership is specially referred to in the report as being dealt with by the conference at some length. It was ultimately agreed, that land should tie owned by the community, but that each country should send in, for future consideration, a statement as to the best means of applying the principle of national ownership of land.* The resolution was as follows :-&quot; It is resolved that the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall constitute an international commission, which shall, while giving due regard to the sovereign rights of each state, consider and report what measures can be adopted to regulate the migration of workers out of their native country, and to protect the interests of wage-earners residing in another country than their own.&quot; *f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 9,. 28th August, p. 290.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (Jersey).-Building trades operatives in Jersey have decided to hand in strike notices, to take effect on the 1st October, to enforce their demands for a 48-hour week in winter, and an increase in wages which will bring the hourly pay to Is. 3d.Coal Miners (National).-Negotiations between the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the President of the Board of Trade were resumed during the week at the request of the Federation. Conferences were held at the Board of Trade on the 16th, the 17th and the 20th September to discuss modified proposals put forward by the miners.These proposals were as follows : &apos;(a) That the Government should concede forthwith the advance in wages of 2s. per shift. (6) That the Government agree that the increased wages costs, consequent upon this application being conceded, should not be put upon the price of home-consumed coal.(c) That a competent and representative tribunal be appointed to inquire into, and to determine,whether, in view of the financial position of the industry, a reduction in the price&apos; of domestic coal should take place, and, if so, to what extent.(d) That a competent committee should be established to inquire into the cause of declining output,and to make recommendations with a view to rectifying the same.(e) That a full inquiry should be instituted into the wage system now prevailing in the industry,with a view to granting up-to-date standards of wages for both piece-workers and time or day workers.Agreement between the miners and the President of the Board of Trade was, however, prevented by. the latter&apos;s refusal to concede the miners&apos; demand for an immediate increase of wages, and the miners&apos;rejection of the Governmenfs offer of an impartial court of inquiry. Much stress&apos; was laid upon the last two points of the miners&apos; revised proposals, and a full discussion of them took place.A delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation met on the 21st September to consider the report of the executive on these negotiations. This meeting endorsed the policy of the leaders and agreed that &quot; nothing had emerged in the conversations with Sir Robert Home which would justify the prevention of a strike.&quot; Meetings of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation were held on the same day to discuss the position which these bodies should take up at the full delegate con-ferehce of the Triple Alliance on the 22nd September. This conference decided at the close of the first day&apos;s session to appoint a deputation to visit the Prime Minister. Accord-ingly the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation,, accompanied by Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P.,- &apos; Canadian Trades and Labour Conference. Only fragmentary reports are to hand of the annual session of the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress which met recently at Windsor (Ontario). All resolutions expressing sympathy with the &quot; One Big Union &quot; movement are reported to have been overwhelmingly defeated. Two resolutions on the Irish question, declaring for self-determination, and demanding.the instant withdrawal of the British. &quot; Army of Occupation &quot; from Ireland, were rejected ; and a resolution of the previous Con-gress was re-affirmed in favour of Dominion Home Rule. A resolution declaring the Congress opposed to any attempt of the Dominion Government to support intervention in the affairs of Russia was also defeated.Mr. Tom Thorne and Mr. Draper were re-elected President and Secretary respectively. The next Congress will be held at Winnipeg in 1921.       .&apos; ,.International Conference of Municipal Workers. A&apos;special international conference of municipal workers was held in London during the past week. Representatives were present from Belgium, France, Holland, Norway and Sweden. Great Britain.was represented by the secretaries of the three unions who are now combined in the National Amalgamated Workers&apos;, Union, namely, Mr. Chas. Duncan, of the Workers&apos; Union, Mr.&apos;J. N. Bell, of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, and Mr. P. J. Tevenan, of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association. No decisions of the conference are reported except, the election of a secretariat, with Mr. P. J. -Tevenan as president. ,International Federation of Trade Unions. In consequence of what they consider to be the slow work of the League of Nations in the reconstruction of Europe, the International Federation of Trade Unions have called a special congress, to meet in London on the 22nd November. The agenda covers the facilitation of international distribution of foodstuffs, coal and raw materials ; the stabilisation of the rates of exchange ; and.the question of the socialisation of industry.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.and Mr. C. T. Cramp, of the National Union of Railwaymen, Mr. H. Gosling and Mr. R. Williams, of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, met the Prime Minister, and indicated that the Triple Alliance were fully convinced of the justice of the miners&apos; claim.Engineers (National). A national conference to discuss the wages question has been arranged to take place on the 23rd September between the engineering employers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union. Meanwhile the Liverpool members of the union have decided by a large majority to remove the embargo on overtime work, which they imposed at the end of July after the adverse decision of the Industrial Court on the national wages demand.Dyers and Finishers (Textile Trade). Notices to terminate the existing wages agree-ment expire on the 13th October.  An application has been put forward for an advance of 40 per cent, on current rates,, with a minimum of  5 a week for adult males and  3 a&apos; week for females, and a guarantee of 25 per cent, over day-rates for piece-workers.  The claim is under discussion by the employers&apos; associations.Vehicle Builders (London and Southern Counties). Notices to cease work on the 27th September have been issued by vehicle builders in London and the Southern Counties, owing to no reply having been received to a demand for a revision of wages. A national wages agreement expired on the 1st September, and the new settlement which has been negotiated covers only the Midlands and the North of, England.Vehicle Builders (Glasgow). Glasgow vehicle builders have balloted in favour of a strike to enforce their demand for increased wages. Strike notices expire on the 25th September.  About 1,400 men are involved.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Cotton Spinners (Oldham). Cotton operatives at Royton and Shaw came out on strike on the 15th September, owing to their refusal to accept the terms of the recent mule staffing agreement. About 177 mills have now ceased work, and 30,000 operatives are affected. The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations are considering a general lock-out of all operatives employed by the federated firms. The matter will be discussed at a meeting of the general committee of the federation on the 28th September.Tramwaymen (Newcastle). Newcastle tramwaymen ceased work on the 21st September on the ground that some of the employees are non-unionists. It is reported that the tram service is completely suspended, fTaxi-all Drivers (London). In connection with the refusal of some drivers to take out their cabs until the proprietors agree to withdraw the imposition of \d. per mile towards the increased cost of petrol, it is now stated that a considerable number of employers have yielded individually, but that the London Motor Cab Proprietors&apos; Association maintain their position.Carpenters and Joiners (Wrexham). A strike of carpenters and joiners took place last week at the works of Messrs. W. Thomas &amp; Co., Ltd. The men struck as a protest against the employment of ex-Service men on semi-skilled work. The firm had recently offered to train 200 ex-Service men in certain branches of carpentry, but the carpenters&apos; and joiners&apos; association objected on the ground that it might ultimately cause unemployment amongst skilled men. The firm are now advertising for a number of skilled joiners who have been on active service.Settlements and Agreements.Printers (Manchester and LAverpool). The negotiations between Mr. A. A. Purcell and Mr. E. Poulton, of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, and the executive of the Typographical Association, resulted in a settlement of this strike, which began on the 28th August.* The terms of settlement provide that the question of wages and status shall be relegated to the executive council of the Typographical Association, and that all the men,shall be reinstated in their old positions in order of urgency, without prejudice. A vote of the men was taken,and showed a majority of 143 in favour of accepting these terms.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Departments section of the Report, pp. 402 to 404.]* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 10, 4th September, p. 315. f This dispute was settled on the 23rd inst.

The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 210 as regards men, and an increase of 493 in respect of women.All divisions except the Northern report increases in the men&apos;s register, and all except the South-Western in the women&apos;s register.; Men&apos;s Employment.Shipbuilding and other Industries. In the shipbuilding and allied industries a shortage of material is still reported from a number of centres in Scotland. At Clydebarik the dispute between the platers and their helpers has caused the discharge of a large number of Workers in the shipyards. Considerable unemployment prevails at Dumbarton among riveters, holders-on, platers, platers&apos; helpers, fitters, turners, electricians and general shipyard labourers. At Greenock the labour situation is unchanged, the demand for coopers, shipwrights and ironmoulders remaining urgent. The Northern Division report that, owing to transport difficulty and the consequent shortage of material, slackness is prevalent in the Tyne and Wear areas, affecting especially platers, riveters, caulkers, drillers and labourers. In the Tees area, however, employment is generally good, although there is still a noticeable slackness in some departments of the shipyards, due to the intermittent deliveries of material. West Hartlepool report that uneriiploy-ment is gradually decreasing.In the North-Western Division the general slackness in trade remains the principal feature of the labour situation. The outlook is clouded by trade disputes in several important industries. There is a general tendency on the part of employers to mark time until the fear of a national coal strike is removed. The strike of Typographical Association members in Manchester and Liverpool is stated to be seriously affecting several paper mills at Blackburn and Darwen.The continued depression in the cotton industry is also the cause of much unemploy-ment, and there are as yet no sure signs of improvement. The depression in the boot and shoe, leather, lace and jute trades has not yet lifted.Shortage of Labour. In London the scarcity of carpenters,, joiners and bricklayers: is still serious^ and it is becoming as difficult to obtain plasterers as bricklayers. Every-effort is made to fill orders for housing schemes, but it is difficult to persuade the few available skilled men to take up work in outlying districts, when suitable employment lies ready to band in the centre of London. The decorating trade, on the other hand,
has eased considerably, and a large number of painters and painters&apos; labourers have made claims to benefit.There is still an unsatisfied demand for moulders of all classes, coach, motor and wagon builders, wheelwrights, tinsmiths, fire-clay goods makers, earthenware casters and wood turners.Industrial Developments. Wimbledon report a proposal to erect printing works at a cost of  150,000. Information has reached Portsmouth that a London firm propose erecting factories at the Farlingham racecourse for breaking up munition boxes.The work of extending the pier at Aberystwyth will commence in November and will provide work for considerable numbers on the live register. It is expected to continue for two years.Labour Reductions. Messrs. Clement Talbot, Ltd., motor engineers, have discharged 700 workmen on closing down their Hendon branch. Messrs. G. Campling &amp; Co., Cowes, have discharged about 200 workpeople during the past week. At Preston, Messrs. Wood-Milne, Ltd., have discharged a large number of Workmen owing to trade depression.Shortage of Material. At Penge the Motor Manufacturing Co. are suspending men &apos; owing to a lack of raw material. Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., New-castle-on-Tyne, have suspended Saturday work in their locomotive department owing to a scarcity of material; and at the Neptune Works of Messrs. Swan, Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson, Ltd., Wallsend-on-Tyne, a short-time arrangement has been necessary owing to the same cause. Shortage of material continues to be felt among engineering firms at Grantham.Miscellaneous. A Barnsley colliery is in a position to absorb 200 workers, but owing to the scarcity of lodging accommodation it has become practically impossible to bring workers from other districts.Women&apos;&apos;s Employment.General Industrial Situation.-Discharges continue at the chief industrial centres and further arrangements for working short time have been made in most of the factories employing women. Only in a few cases are new factories being opened, and, except for domestic and seasonal agricultural work, there is very little demand for women workers.The textile trade is still experiencing depression, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Chorley and Darwen being chiefly affected in the North-Western Division, and Bradford and Dewsbury in the Yorkshire area. Slightly more activity is reported, however, in certain branches of the woollen trade at Bradford. A small demand for skilled weavers is still reported from the Yorkshire towns. Weavers and cardroom workers are required in some Lancashire towns, but housing difficulties and reluctance to work away from home are preventing the transference of labour. In Scotland, Kirkcaldy and Dunfermline are the only towns seriously affected by the textile depression, and, if the skilled operatives discharged in these districts are willing to move, there is every prospect of their being placed at Selkirk or Peebles.All divisions again report depression in the leather, rubber, lace, wholesale clothing, cable-making, chemical, boot and shoe, and hosiery trades. Further discharges have occurred among metal machinists at Northampton, tin box makers at Bermondsey, Hackney and Deptford, ropemakers at Willington Quay, and jam makers at Wigton and Burton-on-Trent. At Newcastle, even highly skilled dressmakers are unable to obtain work, and at Tamworth and Oxford the tailoring factories are open only one day each week. On the other hand, an improvement in the dressmaking trade is reported from Walham Green, Great Marlborough Street and Leyton, although the London winter season has not yet commenced. A certain number of women electrical Workers are said to have been thrown out of employment owing to the electrical trade dispute, at Coventry, Salford, Stafford, Romford, Chelmsford and East Ham.Local Reporte.-Ths Acton and Brentford Exchanges comment specially on the slackness in the laundry trade. London dressmakers are very hopeful of a good autumn season, but there appears to be a tendency on the part of wholesale manufacturers to limit their output to goods for which they have actually received orders. Tooting report a shortage of experienced workers in the printing trade. Many unskilled women have been placed as bottle-washers at Camberwell, as seed factory workers at Wimbledon; as hop pickers at Maidstone, and as grass weeders at the local golf club at Harrow. Gravesend, Great Marlborough Street, Richmond, Shepherds Bush and Tooting report a definite
improvement in the attitude towards resident domestic service, and a corresponding increase in placings.Discharges affectifig paper sorters, paper bag makers, and confectionery workers have occurred at Bristol. The situation regarding unskilled women has been temporarily eased by the placing of many women as pea, fruit and hop pickers. The glove trade at Yeovil and Crewkerne is very slack. Small demands for labour have been received from the flax factories at Taunton and Dorchester.There is very little demand for women workers in the Birmingham district, and a large number of women are claiming unemployment insurance benefit. The jewellery trade at Hockley continues slack, and there is depression in the motor and engineering works at Coventry. At Tipton the shortage of men moulders is said to be hindering the employment of women. Worcester and Stourbridge have placed many unskilled factory hands as hop pickers.The preparations for opening two branch hosiery factories in Leicester have been suspended. Discharges are continuing in the engineering works at Watford, Letch-worth and Northampton, and short time is being arranged in the paper and printing works at Hemel Hempstead and Leicester.In most districts of the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division unemployment is not yet abnormal. In the agricultural districts there is a brisker demand for labour, and Boston, Scunthorpe, Selby and Hull have been active in supplying women workers. The opening of a new file factory at Chesterfield has been delayed owing to difficulty in securing electric power. The lace and hosiery trades are still very unsteady and short time continues to be worked ; it is estimated that about 1,850 women are affected.In the North-Western Division there is a general slackness in slipper-making, hatting, silk making-up and shirt-making. The number of applicants for Work is slowly increasing, and difficulty is being experienced in placing dressmakers, waitresses, factory hands and daily domestic workers in many districts.A general dullness in trade is reported from all parts of Scotland. The position is particularly acute at Aberdeen, owing to the very poor fishing season, which is said to be the worst since 1879. The export trade has also been small, and consequently the pre-serving factories have engaged fewer women than usual.Glasgow is experiencing much difficulty in placing skilled dressmakers, tailoresses, various classes of machinists and shorthand-typists, hut unemployment is most pro-nounced amongst unskilled workers, for whom there is no demand.Considerable slackness of work in the tinplate trade is reported from Neath and Port Talbot.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance. The Willenhall Committee strongly disapprove of a resolution of the Finchley Committee, suggesting the augmentation of out-of-work donation by allowances from the National Relief Fund. The committee were of the opinion that any such form of charity should be condemned.Training. Cheltenham have appointed a special sub-committee to endeavour to reduce the number of &quot; unmated &quot; cases of interrupted apprenticeship, and to decide on methods of publicity regarding the time limit for the receipt of applications.Ex-Service Men. The Grays Committee have considered the question of overtime worked in local factories, and have decided to appeal to employers to engage ex-Service men in preference to working overtime. The Scunthorpe Committee unanimously resolved to support the resolution circulated by the Mexborough Committee, that the Minister of Pensions be requested to increase the pensions of disabled men in proportion to the general increase in wages and that the percentage added to pre-war earnings when assessing alternative pensions be also increased. In connection with the National Scheme, it was stated that the Frodingham Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., were anxious to furnish an under-taking but could not guarantee to employ more than 4 per cent, disabled ex-Service men. The company intended, however, to reserve vacancies whenever possible for disabled men. A proposal was eventually carried unanimously that the matter be referred back to the Lincolnshire Ironmasters&apos; Association for further consideration, with a view to arriving at an agreed percentage applicable to all the iron and steel firms in the area, and that undertakings be submitted for the consideration of the committee in accordance with the decision which may be arrived at.
Publicity.-T]ie Wednesbury Committee decided to support a resolution from the Bradford Committee regarding adverse criticism of Employment exchanges, the chairman remarking that the Exchanges had been instrumental to a very large extent in preventing the long queues of workmen &quot;literally begging at the gates of factories for work.&quot;OUT-OF-WORK DONATION.Payments Made. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 9th September, show 745 payments to civilian workers, and 148,631 to ex-members of the Forces. The total amount disbursed to date is  22,402,386 to civilian workers and  32,798,789 to ex-members of the Forces.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Payments Made. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 3rd September was 39,400, involving an amount of  20,032 18s. 2d.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 15th September, 20,361 certificates have been issued to employers enrolled under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 218,700 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller of the Northern Division reports that, as a result of an inter-view with the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, a Civic Committee is about to be formed. The aim of this committee will be to obtain particulars of every unemployed ex-Service man, and to arrange a canvass of employers by important citizens of Newcastle. Letters have been sent to all chairmen of Local Employment Committees in this division, asldng them to discuss similar schemes with the local municipal authorities, and in practically every area a committee is in process of formation.The Coventry Employment Exchange report that 15 placings were effected as a result of an article on the problem of finding employment for disabled ex-Service men, inserted in a local newspaper. The article contained particulars of disabled men on the live register.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Apprenticeship: Tailoring (Cardiff). The scheme of apprenticeship^ prepared on the initiative of the Cardiff Juvenile Employment Committee, has been approved by the Cardiff and District Bespoke Tailors&apos; Association, and by the Cardiff branch of the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses. It has also received confirmation by the City of Cardiff Education Committee and by the Cardiff City Council. In accordance with the scheme, the Committee are establishing a sub-committee to be known as the Juvenile Employment (Tailoring Apprenticeship) Sub-Committee, which will supervise the working of the scheme, consider all matters relating to the employment of boys and girls in the tailoring trade, and act for the trade as an advisory body to the Juvenile Employment Committee and the local education authority.Fixed School-Leaving Periods.-It is evident that it will be some time before employers really grow accustomed to the fixed school-leaving periods. In a few places the new regulation is said to be receiving gradual recognition, but the more general opinion is that when employers reserve vacancies for the end of the school term, they only do so because of the absence of any other form of suitable labour. That employers will in time adapt their methods to meet the new conditions seems likely from a report from Scotland, -where in important districts, such as Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, fixed school-leaving periods have long been the rule.The North-Western Division complain that the prevalence of school exemptions and half-time work has not given the new arrangement a fair trial. There is some indication that Trade Board rates are operating to encourage the employment of younger workers and consequently help to emphasise the chances offered by school-leaving periods.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department mil also he found on-pages 382, 383, 384, 397 and 398.]* See this Report, No. 22, 26th June, p. 778.

On the 15th September there were -19,597 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 8th September and the 28th July being 19,749 and 21,772 respectively. On the 15th September, the number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 16,422, the totals for the 8th September and the 28th July being 16,091 and 13,812 respectively.The number of men in training is still increasing, and the number on the waiting lists continues to fall, though the changes during the week have not been large. Approxi-mately 500 men were placed in training during the week, a fairly satisfactory total, though somewhat below the average.Government Instructional Factories. On the 1st September, 5,880 men were in training in Government Instructional Factories, 8,795 in other institutional centres, and 9,539 in employers&apos; workshops either for full-time training or in improverships. On the 1st June the corresponding totals were 4,080, 10,161 and 9,950 respectively. In the three months the number of men in training in Instructional Factories rose by over 45 per cent. With the development of Instructional Factory schemes, there will be an increasing tendency to concentrate institutional training as far as possible in these factories. This will facilitate the release of accommodation at the technical schools, which is in great request for normal educational purposes.Marked progress has been made during the last four months in the Middlesex Division. For many months men had to be sent to other divisions for training. The division is now particularly well supplied with institutions of the factory type. On the 19th May the number of men in training in the division was 424; on the 15th September it had been raised to 860. During the same period the waiting list had been, reduced from 1,189 to 574, and the number of men who had finished their training increased from 177 to 320. During the past two months, a substantial number of men from adjoining divisions have been admitted to training in Middlesex centres.The Northern and the Middlesex Divisions stand first as regards the proportion of men training in Instructional Factories. The numbers of men in training in the two divisions are 765 and 761 respectively; in both cases over 85 per cent, are in Instructional Factories, and all but about 20 of the remainder in employers&apos; workshops.A start has been made with the erection of four houses on the Walker Estate: by the bricklaying class of the Walker Government Instructional Factory. All timber&apos;work for these-houses is to be carried out in the factory, though part may be passed on to Birtley, should there be more work on hand than the joiners&apos; shop can undertake conveniently. The scheme has aroused some &quot;criticism and opposition on the part of the operatives&apos; society, but it is hoped that an amicable solution may be reached.
Ex-Service Men-continued.The scheme for the establishment of an Instructional Factory for Ireland at Gor-manstown has had to be abandoned.After many delays the Gamden Town Factory was opened, with 39 men in the coach-painting course.The Lancaster Street Factory, Birmingham, has. now placed. 120 men in employers&apos; workshops, and it is believed that this number, will be increased to 160 by the end of the month.Limitation of Admissions. In a good many divisions the limitation now being placed on the number of admissions to training by Local Technical Advisory Committees in certain trades is causing considerable anxiety. In some cases available accommodation and equipment cannot be utilised fully, and it is felt that, if the rate at which committees are closing their lists is maintained, the number of trades in which men may be trained will be reduced to quite small proportions. The numbers on the general waiting lists, which are approaching manageable proportions in most divisions, will rise again, and there will be much disappointment and discontent.The building trades, in which opportunities of absorption would appear to be very considerable, are beginning to apply the closure in certain areas. During the past few days, however, the situation seems to have been somewhat relieved, and there is reason to hope that, for the time being, Local Technical Advisory Committees will be recom-mended to continue to admit men.Trade depression and unrest are tending to increase the difficulty of finding improver-ship vacancies. Should unemployment cfevelop during the autumn it is likely that unemployed ex-Service men will turn to training as a form of relief. This will render it necessary to scrutinise applications most carefully; otherwise the training centre will provide merely temporary relief.Publicity. The exhibition, at Employment Exchanges in Birmingham, of work done by men in training, together with a list of training vacancies, is proving a valuable means of publicity. It seems highly desirable that displays on similar lines should be given in other important centres.On the 17th September a representative party of journalists from London and the provinces visited the Bernard Oppenheimer Diamond Works at Brighton. They were conducted round the factory in small groups, and had full opportunity of seeing the men at work and the lay-out of the factory. They appeared to be very favourably impressed. Special interest was shown in the well-equipped clinic. Mr. Trevillyan, of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, commented on the fact that, although he questioned many of the men very closely, he received no complaints.There are now over 600 men at work at the factory, of whom about 200 are in the training stage.Treasury Sanctions.The following are among the more important of a number of proposals which have received Treasury sanction since the issue of the last Report: Expenditure upon general equipment and shop tools for the Carlow and Miller Street Government Instructional Factory, Camden Town.Covering sanction for expenditure upon equipment for premises at Bailey Street, Sheffield.Authority to conduct a hostel and canteen at the Government Instructional Factory, Springbank, Hull.Authority to rent from the Dunlop Rim and Wheel Co., Ltd., the Alma Street Factory, Coventry, in substitution for No. 4 Shop of the National Filling Factory. Establishment of a canteen at the Ponders End Instructional Factory.The authority granted by the Treasury, as indicated in the last issue of this Report, on page 370, to extend training where, owing to the gereral state of industry improver-ships are not immediately available, is strictly limited. In no circumstances can an extension be granted for more than a month on the authority of a Divisional Director, or more than a further month on the authority of headquarters. Extensions as authorised must be reckoned as part of the three months to which extensions are limited by previous sanctions.Schemes Sanctioned.During the week. 23 schemes, providing 505 places, have been sanctioned. Included in this number are 276 places for training in various branches of the building trade.
Ex-Service Men-continued.National Trade Advisory Committees.Building.-A meeting of the Committee was held at St. Ermins on the 15th September, when considerable discussion took place on the resolution, put forward on behalf of the carpenters and joiners, proposing to close admission to training as from the 30th September. The resolution was not seconded, possibly because the resolution passed at the annual meeting of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives* had not yet been considered by the executive councils of the unions other than that of the carpenters and joiners. The whole position, however, was discussed fully by all the employees&apos; repre-sentatives. It was finally agreed that the resolution be brought up again at the next meeting, by which time the executive councils of the other unions will have had the opportunity of discussing the resolution of the National Federation. It is considered, however, that the Controller^ point that.the chances of retaining Government Instruc-tional Factories as training schools for apprentices will be jeopardised if training is shut down immediately will undoubtedly be brought to the notice of the executive councils, and will have a great bearing on their decision.Baslcet-making-Thz secretary attended a meeting of the Committee at Pudsey on the 7th September. A discussion took place respecting the number of men in training. It was resolved that no action could be taken by the Committee until the district sub-committees definitely decided that they had trained as many men as the trade could absorb in their areas. :   . :The Worshipful Company of Basketmake^rs are holding a basket-making examination at the Girdlers&apos; Hall, Basinghall Street, on the 14th October. A section will he devoted to specimens of work executed by disabled sailors and soldiers under the Ministry&apos;s scheme, and certificates of merit will be awarded for good workmanship in each of. six classes. A prize to the value of  5 has been offered for the best specimen exhibited by ex-Service men training in the trade.Local Technical Advisory Committees.Building-The inaugural meeting of the Barnstaple Local Technical Advisory Com-mittee was held on the 14th September and was attended by the Director of the Trade Advisory Committees Section, who explained the objects of the scheme and the functions of the committee. The committee, who were extremely sympathetic, expressed a desire to inspect the Government Instructional Factory at Radnor Road, where it is proposed to train the men from this area.The secretary of the National Trade Advisory Committee attended the first meeting of the Plymouth Committee on the 13th September. A sub-committee of the Bristol Local Technical Advisory Committee has in the past covered this district. This sub-committee has now been enlarged and constitutes an independent Local Technical Advisory Committee. *Tailoring. The secretary of the National Trade Advisory Committee attended the inaugural meeting of the Cheltenham Local. Technical Advisory Committee on the 13th September, when it was agreed to start a class of 12 men. The trade in Cheltenham is of excellent quality, and there is very little seasonal variation in employment.APPRENTICES AND BOYS. INTERRUPTED APPRENTICESHIPS.Questions affecting the Scheme.Wages.-The payment of wages, by employers to apprentices under the scheme is, in general, very satisfactory. Such complaints as are received invariably relate to cases recently accepted under the scheme.The Scheme in Operation.Statistics.-!]]) to the 15th September, 41 schemes had been approved, The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 6th September, Was 250, making a total of 43,871. The number of applications received from apprentices was 300, making a total of 49,296.&quot; &quot;. * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 9, 28th August, p. 289.
Apprentices and Boys-continued.Up to the 15th September, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 42,316 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 40,654 apprentices, employed by 16,102 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 10,287.Applications. Local headquarters have been notified that it is the policy of the department to adhere rigidly to the 30th September as the closing date for applications. Adequate Press notice has been given, and the department will not be prepared to consider later applications on the ground of ignorance. There will be outstanding cases in which there is a doubt as to whether an application should be made under the scheme, requiring further investigation by departmental officers, or a ruling from headquarters. In all such cases the employer, or the apprentice, will be instructed to lodge an application formally at the local Employment Exchange.The Press notices of the closing date are resulting in a steady flow of applications, as many employers and apprentices who have been hesitating for a considerable time have now decided to apply.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance.--The impending labour troubles are causing many employers, who otherwise would entertain the scheme, to refuse apprentices until conditions are more settled. This is all the more unfortunate in view of the approach of the closing date for application.Training in Operation ^Progress. The most recent reports from all areas are favour-able. Training on the whole is progressing Well, complaints either by employers or apprentices are very few, and general satisfaction is expressed at the working of the scheme.Termination of Agreements. The past, present and impending labour troubles have unfortunately resulted in the termination of several agreements. The majority of these have been satisfactorily dealt with.Mr. Harris Lebus, Tottenham, furniture manufacturers, owing to slackness of work has dismissed 43 apprentices. Efforts are being made to obtain technical training for these apprentices. The firm, however, are unwilling to take them back on their books for this purpose, owing to the necessity of receiving them during their holidays from the institution. The firm state that the works will probably be closed altogether. They also urge difficulties with regard to National Insurance. It is hoped that some, at least, of these apprentices will be transferred to other establishments.Institutional Training.-Arrangements are practically concluded for the reopening of classes at the Paisley Technical School of Art and the Koyal Technical College, Glasgow. A full complement of teachers and students is assured.Unmated Apprentices. The slackness of the engineering trades in Leeds and Notting-ham is preventing the mating of apprentices. In Nottinghamshire the industry is reported to be in a very bad way.GENERAL TRAINING.Building Industry Apprenticeship Scheme. Further reports have been received regarding the problem of apprenticeship in the building industry and the steps taken to bring the new Apprenticeship Scheme of the Industrial Council to the: notice of firms and other trade bodies. From widely different localities, such as Croydon and Middles-brough, a serious shortage of apprentices is reported. In Croydon the difficulty is attributed to the continued effects of the abnormal wages earned by lads in munition factories during the war. In Middlesbrough the higher wages offered by the steel works and collieries prove an attraction. On the other hand, the complaint comes from Bermondsey that boys are willing to enter the building trade, but that, there are very few vacancies. There is, however, a general agreement, both in the districts mentioned and at other towns such as Burnley, Sheffield and Swansea, as to the need for the proper organisation of training; and the scheme is welcomed as holding out the best hope of a solution. The need for special local Building Trade Apprenticeship Committees is particularly recognised. In Burnley a desire has been expressed for more classes for apprentices. In Swansea it is hoped that the scheme will soon be in effective operation, a special apprenticeship committee having already been appointed.Sea Service: Training of Boys. An effort is being made to collect  18,000 to establish a Nautical College at Cardiff.  The promoters of the scheme propose to train boys for
Apprentices and Boys-continued.two years before they go to sea. The proposal, however, is stated to have met with some local opposition, although about  8,000 has already been subscribed.Special Classes for Apprentices (Scotland). Although a proposal to institute special classes for engineering apprentices in Edinburgh was warmly welcomed by all the firms interviewed, the number of applications from apprentices has been disappointing. It is doubtful whether there will be a sufficient number to justify the establishment of the classes. A similar proposal at Aberdeen, however, &quot;has met with greater success, and it is certain that a sufficient number of students will be enrolled to permit of the class opening at an early date.Limitation of Apprentices (Lace Industry).-lia. the plain net trade only one apprentice is allowed to every six journeymen. It is therefore somewhat significant that during the late boom in this trade, fullya quarter of the machines were idle, owing to lack of operatives. It would appear that the operatives, in considering whether a higher percentage of apprentices could be allowed, have regard only to what would happen when trade is slack. Owing to this attitude, a Nottingham employer is considering the possibility of training women to run the machines.[Reference to matters of interest to the Training Department will also be found on pages 384 to 386, 388, 391 and 392.] .INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION. JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : NEGOTIATIONS.Brewing. The first meeting of the District Council for the North Midland area was held at Nottingham on the 15th September. Captain Farr, of the employers&apos; side, was elected chairman, and Mr. Heyday, M.P., representing the National Union of General Workers, vice-chairman; Mr. Hobson and Mr. Edlin were appointed secretaries for the employers&apos; and the workers&apos; side respectively. A provisional constitution was adopted on the lines of the model issued by the department.Correspondence was read from firms in the Northampton area to the effect that they do not wish to be represented on the Council, in view of the probable inclusion of beer bottlers under the Aerated Waters Trade Board. It was decided to send a protest to the Ministry and to the Press against the extension of the scope of this Trade Board to include beer bottlers.Mr. Heyday gave notice that the workers were about to submit an application for an advance in wages. It was decided to hold the second meeting of the Council in about three weeks, but that any advances in wages should operate from the 1st October.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : REPORTS.Admiralty. A meeting of the Admiralty Industrial Council was held on the 17th September.  There was a good deal of discussion on a proposal from the trade union side that the assessment of all recommendation marks at dockyard examinations should&apos; be vested in the trade panels of the yard committees.  No agreement was reached.The right of established and hired men in the dockyards to strike was again raised, the Admiralty being asked to give an assurance that strike action would not jeopardise pension or gratuity rights. It was explained that the Admiralty could not give any such assurance, as the award of pensions and gratuities was in the administration of the Treasury.The Admiralty agreed, on representation by the trade union side, that it. should be optional for yard officers to refer questions of promotion and reversion to the yard committees for consideration. Among many other questions discussed were those of apprenticeship, late attendance fines, protective clothing, walking time, and detailed wages statements for employees on pay-day.
* See also p. 403 below.Electricity Supply. A special meeting of the Council was held, at the suggestion of the Ministry, on the 15th September, to consider the situation resulting from the issue of strike notices by the Electrical Trades Union in London and other districts.

It was also agreed that the union having intimated to the Council that they were prepared to withdraw the question of principle arising out of the Penistone dispute, this intimation be regarded as an acceptable basis of settlement, and it be recommended that the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations should withdraw their lock-out notices and the union instruct their members to resume work immediately. *An ordinary meeting of the Council was held on the 17th September.

The employers&apos; side felt unable to come to a decision until they had consulted the employers&apos; sides of the other District Councils in the area, for industries and services in which local authorities are concerned, or had taken a referendum of the local authorities whom they represented. It was agreed that further consideration be deferred until a conference of the employers&apos; side of the District Councils concerned had been held.The executive committee of the Northern Home Counties District Council met on the 16th September.

* See p. 399 above.adjourn until the 17th September. At that sitting Sir Allan Smith read the following terms of agreement arrived at between the two parties at a conference on the previous day:-As the Electrical Trades Union do not demand that foremen must be members of a trade union, it is mutually agreed : (1) The men on strike shall resume work.(2) The notices issued by the federated firms shall be cancelled.(3) A general resumption of work shall take place as soon as possible according to the circum-stances prevailing at each works.

A strike involving about 200 building trade operatives employed by Messrs. Jarvis, Ltd., Tunbridge Wells, has occurred in consequence of a dispute relating to overtime on a contract which was being carried out about three miles from Tunbridge Wells. A few weeks ago arrangements were made by the employers and the operatives concerned to work overtime. Arrangements were made for the men to leave the shop by lorry and to work the normal 8-hour day, with 1 hour overtime each day. The lorry then brought the men back. The employers agreed to pay 10 hours&apos; wages for the 9 hours&apos; work, presumably as compensation for travelling time.On the 7th September the men on this contract left work, and on the 8th September all the operatives employed by the firm ceased work in connection with the same dispute. The precise points at issue are not very clearly understood. It is reported that some of the men still desire to work overtime while others strongly object to this practice on principle.  The Chief Conciliation Officer is in touch with both parties.. Urban District Council Clerical Staff (Pontypridd). A strike of the clerical staff of the Pontypridd Council is threatened, owing to the CounciFs refusal to adopt a scale of wages based- upon the minimum scales of the Joint Industrial Council for Local Authorities, Technical, Clerical and Administrative Services, and agreed upon by the District Council. This action Was taken as a result of a resolution, passed at a meeting of local authorities in Glamorgan and Monmouth, which was convened by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff on the 2nd September, that the scales agreed upon by the Joint Industrial Council could not. be accepted by the^authorities in South Wales and Monmouthshire, and that a committee consisting of fourteen representatives on each side should be appointed to draw up a new scale of salaries.
The Chief Conciliation Officer is endeavouring to arrange a conference between the National Association of Local Government Officers and the Urban District Council with a view to the withdrawal of strike notices.Corporation Workers (Swansea). About 200 clerks employed by the Swansea Cor-poration struck on the 16th September on account of the refusal of the Council to instruct the Joint Staffing Committee to deal with, and finally settle by the 30th September, cases in dispute arising out of the terms of settlement of the strike in February last. The Council are not disposed to enter into negotiations until the clerks resume work.Electricity Workers (Colchester). The employees at the Colchester Corporation electricity works gave notice to cease work on the 15th. September, on account of the refusal of the Corporation to pay the rates recommended by the District Joint Industrial Council and by the National Joint Board. As a result of a conference, arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer, between the Corporation Electricity Committee and repre-sentatives of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association and the Electrical Trades Union, the committee have agreed to recommend to the Corporation that the claims should be referred to the Industrial Court for settlement.Council Employees (Cardiganshire)-An emergency committee of the Council decided on the 13th September that nothing further could be done until the next meeting in November. They apparently hope that the effect of the long strike will bring about a resumption of work shortly.Royal Army Clothing Department Employees (Pimlico). Mr. Butler, of the Royal Army Clothing Department Employees&apos; Union, called with reference to a general claim for a 15s. advance to workpeople employed at Pimlico. The union claim that the work is all much more skilled and responsible than ordinary tailoring, distributing or packing, and the work-people concerned should therefore be paid special rates. Mr. Butler&apos;s attention was drawn to the fact that, as recently as the 26th August, an award Was issued by the Industrial Court in respect of the Pimlico workpeople, and that it would no doubt be difficult to secure the agreement of the Army Council to the reference of a fresh claim to arbitration. . It was finally agreed that the union would make further efforts to negotiate with the Army Council and endeavour to arrive at a settlement, failing which, the matter might be reported to the Ministry.Woollen Workers (West Wales). A strike occurred at Cwerchyr Mill, Henllan, on the 6th September, owing to the discharge of an employee on the ground of physical disability, and his replacement by a girl. The employers&apos; federation in retaliation threatened to lock out all their employees throughout West Wales. The Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union regard the Workers&apos; action as wrong, but state that, if the employers&apos; threat is carried out, it will be likely to lead to serious consequences, and prejudice the chance of an amicable settlement.  The Chief Conciliation Officer is in touch with the parties.Engineering Trade : Four-Monthly Hearings. The Amalgamated Society of General Toolmakers, Engineers and Machinists have given notice of their withdrawal from the Agreement of February, 1917.Lairage Workers (Manchester). The Lord Mayor of Manchester has held a meeting at which representatives of the employers, the Chief Conciliation Officer, and a representative of the Ministry of Food, were present. He urged the employers to agree to arbitration on the wages question. They finally decided to do so, provided that the union would agree to the right of the employer to slaughter his own stock or assist in its slaughter, if he wished, and also to engage and dispense with labour in accordance with his trade requirements. This proposal was placed before the Journeymen Butchers&apos; Federation, who refused to consider the two points insisted upon by the employers, and would only accept arbitration on the question of the 25 per cent, advance. With regard to the first point, they argued that an employer cannot be a member of their federation, and to work with him would be working with a non-unionist. They agreed that employers&apos; sons can work, with them, provided they become members of the Federation. Their reason for refusing the second point is that, by their present method of moving men about from gang to gang as they think fit, they can prevent much unemployment, although individual earnings may be reduced. The Journeymen Butchers&apos; Federation have approached theUnited Carters and Motormen&apos;s Association, but the association are not inclined to render any assistance.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Wages and Arbitration willbefourd also on pages 382 to 388 and 398 to 401.]
