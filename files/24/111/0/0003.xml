0.P.1 803&quot;document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government12liTHE CABINET.THE EGYPTIAN PROPOSALS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE .FOR WAR.I venture to ask most respectfully, but at the same time most urgently, that the . Cabinet may be permitted to have an opportunity of at any rate discussing the -proposals which have been published in all the newspapers for giving independence to Egypt.   I read these proposals for the first time in yesterday&apos;s newspapers with very great bewilderment.The Foreign Office telegrams of the 21st August (Nos. 750 and 751) which reached me last night show that the story published in the newspapers is in all respects true, and that the proposals have been simultaneously communicated to the Press, the public and the British representatives in Egypt before either the Cabinet or Parliament bad been allowed to know of their existence.I submit that this procedure raises a very great difficulty. While the British will be held committed to approving proposals of this character, the Egyptian Nationalists will be free to take them merely as a starting point for further demands ; thus, even &apos; from the point of view of bargaining, the disclosures which have taken place seem to be regrettable. The cession of territory which has been definitely incorporated in the British Dominions is, however, a matter which requires the assent not only of the Cabinet, but of Crown and Parliament.Coming to the actual proposals themselves, one must ask oneself, first, are they real or are they a manoeuvre ? If they are real, they mean that we are giving up Egypt. Egypt is to become an independent country, which will make a Treaty of Alliance with the United Kingdom, accord us certain military and naval facilities, and act in foreign affairs in general conformity with our wishes and interests. Egypt will be free to conduct her internal aifairs as she pleases, i.e., she may substitute the Communist for the individualist system of society. She may raise a large army by conscription or she may abolish the existing Egyptian Army altogether. She may erect a customs tariff or adopt Free Trade. She may appoint ambassadors throughout the world. All these imprescriptible rights of sovereignty are to be conferred upon Egypt on paper.Alternatively, we may be told this is mere camouflage. Not one Egyptian from the Khedive downwards will be able to act otherwise than in accordance with British advice. Although Egypt will be free in theory to do all these things, in practice she will do all she is told. She will be ruled under such systems and through such agents as the British Government choose and under no other. Having formally divested ourselves of every shadow of legal right, we shall nevertheless exercise final and absolute power. It is true there will be no Army of Occupation, but the same troops living in the same barracks will be called &quot; The British Army for maintaining the communications with the East.&quot; When a state of disorder arises in Cairo, British soldiers who are called upon to fire on the crowd will not be shooting in order to suppress tumult in Egypt.   They will be &quot; safeguarding our communications with the East,&quot; &amp;c.If this, as I expect, is really what is meant by &quot;the new instrument, I can only think that the Egyptian Nationalists must be very great simpletons if they let it rest there. Their demand is for the effective and responsible control of their own country -and the right to govern or misgovern it as they please. It is because this has never been accorded to them, and never can be accorded to them while we remain in the country, that they are discontented. It is not the empty form of independence which they seek, but the reality. Is the British nation willing to concede that reality ? If not, will the British resistance to the concession of that reality be rendered more difficult or more easy by the concession of the form ? 1 think it will be rendered vastly more difficult.Incidentally, I may observe that it sweeps away altogether any claim which we might make for recovering any portion of the cost of the garrison from the Egyptian taxpayer.   This garrison is declared by us to be in Egypt for a purely Imperial(B20/371)   100  8/20  h&amp;S, Ltd.  8502wo79Egypt 55f
purpose, namely, the maintenance of our communications with the East, and not as an Army of Occupation. Therefore, obviously, we have no claim upon the independent State of Egypt.The repercussion of these proposals and this model upon other parts of the British Empire may even be more serious than the effect on Egypt. If we leave out the word &quot; -%ypt&quot; m the document circulated last night by the Foreign Office and substitute the word &quot; Ireland,&quot; it would with very small omissions make perfectly good sense, and would constitute a complete acceptance of Mr. De Valera&apos;s demands.One can also easily see that these proposals will become immediately the goal of Indian nationalism. The ideal which Mr. Montagu has been endeavouring to hold up before Indian eyes of India as a great self-governing Dominion within the ambit of the British Empire and under the supreme authority of the British Monarchy will be discarded in favour of an independent Indian Empire, according, no doubt, to the British the sort of trading and practical facilities which were obtained in the Eighteenth Century by the British East India Company. I thought we had all arrived in common at the conception of the British Empire as a grouping of self-governing Dominions gathered together under the aegis of the Crown, developing under various degrees of responsibility within that circle.   Surely here we are taking a retrograde step.After all, the Proclamation of the Protectorate over Egypt was a solemn act of State, and we have laboriously procured the assent of all our Allies, one after another, to that act. No sooner is this done than we come forward and tear up the charter to which we have just obtained the signatures of all the greatest Powers in the world.It may have been wise or unwise to alter the juridicial status of Egypt in the war, and I myself have often thought that the ex-Khedive was, treated with precipitate severity ; but a step of this kind, once taken, ought not to be lightly retraced. In my judgment we should adhere to the broad ideal of full self-government within the Empire and under the Crown for all parts of the King&apos;s Dominions, whether in Egypt, Ireland or India, and that any departure from this ideal and goal should only be made by a Government which has definitely submitted its case to the British Parliament. Following this conviction, it seems to me that the most we have to offer to the Egyptians or to the Irish is real concessions in regard to the management of their own affairs, and that all demands to break away from the British Empire and British Crown should be perseveringly withstood.Lastly, it is my duty to point out that neither the War Office nor the Air Ministry, nor, so far as I know, the Admiralty have been consulted in any way upon the strategic bearing of these proposals, and I submit that the Cabinet should have the advice of the military and naval experts before them before giving their assent to such a scheme.I append memoranda by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and by the Chief of the Air Staff.w. s. c.War Office,24th August, 1920.APPENDIX.(I)MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.Secretary of State,I wish to direct your attention to the attached documents * and more particularly to paragraphs 3 (ii.) and 4 (ii) of the Memorandum drawn up between Lord Milners Mission, and communicated apparently to Zaghloul Pasha and the members of the Egyptian Delegation.From Foreign Office telegram No. 750, dated 21st August, it will be observed that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have not yet considered the policy &quot; in question. At the same time it is recognized in a subsequent paragraph that though it is not intended for publication, yet &quot; as Zaghloul and his associates are acquainted with it and will base their campaign upon it, the main points are certain to become generally known.&quot;* Foreign Office telegrams to Mr. Scott, Nos. 750 and 751.
As you are aware, this has already occurred since the draft agreement has appeared in British newspapers, and is apparently accepted by the general public as being an expression of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. The draft agreement, if confirmed, must have a far-reaching effect on the military situation of the British Empire, since, &apos;as I have stated in previous papers, Egjrpt is the &quot; Clapham Junction&quot; of Imperial communications. There also arises the question of access to the Sudan, which presumably would not be united to Egypt if and when the latter country receives its independence. So far as I am aware the General Staff have not in any way been consulted as to the military effect of the proposal contained in the draft Memorandum, and this aspect of the question appears to have been overlooked, or was considered to be adequately safeguarded by paragraph 3 (ii) and 4 (ii).Whether this is the case would undoubtedly depend very largely on the interpretation given to the paragraphs in question, and I would urge that in the event of the acceptance of the Agreement in principle by the Government, the fighting services be given full opportunity of expressing their views on the vital questions dealt with in these two paragraphs.H. W.25th August, 1920.(II.)MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF. Secretary of State.The changed status of Egypt, if the Times reports are true, is causing me considerable anxiety.The matter is intimately bound up with our development and our programme for next year; for example, we are relying on Egypt to assist us in training personnel for our five reserve squadrons, and are proposing to start on a large rigid airship base in the country.The Air Force has a peculiar interest in Egypt, and I hope the new policy of the Government will not undo the work of construction to which we are committed.Owing to the pressure of work I have not had time to submit this draft quite in the form that I should have liked, or to examine it sufficiently carefully, as this would have taken&apos;some little time, but in view of your request and the urgency of the matter I venture to submit it.H. TftENCRARD.Air Ministry.25th August, 1920.Air Staff Notes on the Effect of the New Status of Egypt.As far as can be ascertained from newspaper reports it is proposed to recognize the independence of Egypt in amity and association with the British Empire. From an Imperial defence point of view the most important items in the proposed treaty appear to be : (1.) The maintenance of a small British garrison (the figure 3,000 is mentioned) inthe Canal zone, which thus becomes a British enclave. (2.) The guarantee by Great Britain of Egyptfs integrity against outside aggression. (3. The recognition by Egypt of Great Britaihs privileged position i n the Valleyof the Nile.(4. In the case of war, Great Britain to have every facility and access to Egyptian&apos; territory.(5.) The abolition of the capitulations. Under these, foreigners in Egypt have the right to investigation and trial by their own Governments. The new proposaljippears to entrust the interests of all foreigners to the British High (J   hissioner.(6.) The exclif, i %  the Sudan.
It is difficult on the information given for the Air Staff to estimate the effects of these proposals on the distribution and development of the Royal Air Force, it is possible, however, to make a few comments on the situation as it appears from the small amount of information at present obtainable.Clause (l). The maintenance of a British garrison in the Canal zone. Under this clause a. certain number of Air Force units would be stationed in Egypt, essentially for the protection of the Canal, but these would not in any way suffice for the Royal Air Force requirements which will be referred to below. Even for the purposes of the Canal garrison it may be difficult to obtain the necessary number of aerodromes, though this cannot be definitely stated until the boundaries of the zone are more clearly defined, in any case the abandonment of existing Air Force stations in Egypt proper and the transference of a certain number of them to new sites in the British enclave would lead to considerable expense for works and buildings.Clause (2). It is possible that in this clause Great Britains guarantee of Egypfs integrity against outside aggression might be permitted to take the form of military assistance stationed in the country. A reference to the withdrawal of the normal British garrison in Egypt, however, appears to make it impossible to take this view, and it is possible that the guarantee will be similar to that given to Belgium and troops would only be sent to the country should necessity arise.Clause (3). Appears to be almost entirely a reference to our commercial position in the Valley of the Nile; doubtless this has some bearing on the amount of British capital sunk in large irrigation works and other development schemes.Clause (4). As it stands is exceptionally vague. Interpreted in its broadest sense in the event of any war, say, for example against an Arab Empire, Great Britain would be able to base her operations on Egyptian territory. In practice it would appear that grave complications might ensue, since the Egyptian Government might be on friendly terms with  Great Britain&apos;s potential enemy, who might be waging a war of aggression on British territory at, &quot;say, Aden or in the Persian Gulf.Clause (5). Regarding the capitulations is of little military interest.Clause (6). Under this clause it is presumed that the Sudan would become a British protectorate, possibly on the lines of British Somaliland. Under these circumstances the Air Force would have no great interest in the country other than the provision of a small detachment to aid any military; garrison stationed therein.Apart from these details the policy of the Air Ministry appears to be affected in the gravest possible manner by the new proposals. Egypt has for some time occupied the position of a keystone in the Royal Air Force scheme. It is, on account of its climate, an admirable training ground for airmen; it is the headquarters of the Air Force throughout the Near and Middle East; in the country are stationed squadrons which form a semi-mobile reserve for these areas ; large expenses have been incurred in the provision of workshops and dep6ts, and a proposal is in hand to form in the country a large rigid airship base; and, finally, it is possibly the most important junction in the world for an Imperial air route point of view.If the proposals enumerated above have been rightly interpreted all these activities of the Royal Air Force must cease or be severely hampered, much money will have been thrown away and a complete new orientation of our policy undertaken. It is difficult at the moment to see any area which can take the place of Egypt in the scheme for the Royal Air Force as a whole; its central position, its comparative proximity to England, its equitable climate and its situation on the highways of the workTs commerce render it unique, and it is thus evident that the importance placed by the Air Staff on this country is of a quite especial nature even as compared with the interests of the Admiralty and War Office.It is possible that these points have not been overlooked in arriving at the decision (if such has indeed been taken) on this matter; in any case, it is assumed that the details of the treaty to be enacted have yet to be worked out. In this belief the Air Staff assumes that His Majesty&apos;s Government will give due weight to the views herein expressed, and will afford the Air Ministry an.opportunity of reviewing the same when:, the treaty is being definitely drafted.
