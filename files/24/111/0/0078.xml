B77    U)This Document Is the Property of      ^yfku^J:CABINETGERMAN CREDITS AND FOOD PURCHASES, MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER.I desire to circulate the accompanying report by Mr. E. P. Wise for the information of the Cabinet,It sets forth certain complaints put forward by the Germans at the recent Conference between myself and the German Food Controller with regard to the carry-ing out of the terms of the Spa Agreement,    These again raise questions of policy outside the scope of the Ministry of Food that may be worth the attention of the Cabinet or of other Departments.CHARLES A. MC CURDY.22nd September, 1920,
ThetFood Controller,1*    At the Conferences which I have attended on your behalf in London and Stresa with the German Food Minister and his officials, a question of considerable general importance has arisen to which I think I ou/?ht to draw formal attention, though, I should point out, that it raises issues, financial and other, of considerable importance besides the immediate technicii question of the provision of food for Germany.   I would remind you that the Conferences with the German food officials were held for the purpose of expediting as far as possible the utili-satioa of the credits provided under the Spa Agreement for the pro-vis ioning of Germany in a manner most likely to help Germany without injuring the interests of the Allied countries concerned.2,    In Article 6 of the Protocol of tlie Spa Conference, it was agreed that the Allied Governments should make substantial advances of money to Germany based dn the delivery of coal month by month. The intention was to enable Germany to purchase food and raw materials for her popu-lation. Before the actual signature of the Protocol, Dr, Simons raised the question as to ihe conditions and terms on which these advances were to be made. He was assured by the Allied Representatives that these were matters of detail to be settled afterwards by the experts, presumably at Geneva.3*    These credits to Germany were in a large measure the foundation of the Spa Agreement. The German Ministers urged very strongly that they Could only justify their agreement as to deliveries of coal, which they were satisfied would cause unemployment in many German in-dustriea, If they could show that this was the price that had to be paid for a substantial improvement in the food position. Actually they adopted this line of argument in justifying.the Spa Agreement to the Reichstag.4.    In the Inter-Allied Agreement made at Spa, relating to the pro-portion of the advances to be made by each Ally, it was agreed that the advances be repaid by Germany not later than May 1st., 1921.   This Allied decision was not at the time communicated to the Germans,5.    At the recent Conferences in London between the British Food Controller and the German Food Controller and at Stresa between the Italian Pood Controller and the German Food Controller, the Germans pointed out very strongly that food credits which have to be re-paid within the cereal year are of no real help&apos; to them, since the more food they buy in the early months the less they will be able to buy in the later months. Experience in food control has shown that it is really easier to maintain a low ration steadily and consistently than to risk the outburst of feeling caused by a sudden diminution of the ration in the latter part of the winter when the strength and the patience of the people are becoming exhausted.6.    The German Food Controller argues, therefore, that it is unsafe in the present dangerous state of German public opinion, to use these credits for a substantial immediate increase in food rations if he cannot see his way to continue the higher ration in the latter part of the winter and the spring of next year. He also argues that the fin-financial decision of the Allies, reached without discussion with the Germans, under which the credits are only to be of about six months duration, is contrary to the whole intention of the Spa Agreement and to the verbal assurances given to Dr. Simons in the Conference, that the details of the financial arrangements would be mutually settled by later discussion.7f    It does appear that from the food point of view the German argument has considerable foundation.   It is necessary now for the German Government to make a general plan for food purchases for the whole year. It is of very.little advantage to them, therefore, to have the use of financial credits now which have got to be paid back later in the cereal year.
8,    The possibility of full co-operation on the part of the miners., transport workers and others concerned in carrying out the terms of-the Spa Agreement will depend largely on whether they feel that the Allied Governments carry out their share of the Spa bargain, on which hopes of considerably improved conditions have been based.   If the coal deliveries break down for reasons either within or outside the control of the German Government, it would be very difficult to refuse to acquiesce in an advance by the French into the Ruhr district.   Such a step would constitute a danger of the gravest nat-ure to the whole peace of Central Europe, and to the Treaties which depend on peace for their observance. It is most desirable, therefore, that the Germans should have no excuse which can be avoided for any failure to carry out their deliveries.9.    The food question still is the biggest single factor in German internal politics *   If the present German Government fails to increase or even to maintain the food rations of the towns, its chances of continued existence are small and the possibilities of its replace-ment by a Government less willing or able to carry out the Treaty are correspondingly large *10,   In these circumstances it would seem-to be necessary if the Germans are to use effectively the credits contemplated by the Spa Agreement, to extend the period of the credits &amp;o as to make them repayable within a period of from two or three years.11*    If this view is accepted it would be&apos; necessary to communicate it to the Allied Governments and to give the necessary instructions to the British Representatives either at the Conference at Geneva or on the Reparation Commission.E. Pf WISE.21. 9. 1920.
