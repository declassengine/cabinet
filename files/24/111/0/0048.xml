Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.I wish to call attention to the Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War with a covering note dated the 27th August 1920 (CP. The Memorandum criticises a passage in a telegramfrom the Civil Commissioner,0Baghdad, of the 12th August last, in which Sir A. Wilson speaks of the &quot; use of aeroplanes against recalcitrants &quot; as one of the reasons (he enumerates 14 in all) underlying the loss of popularity by the Civil Admini-stration in Mesopotamia. Sir H. Trenchard takes exception to Sir A. Wilson&apos;s language, as an attack upon the general policy of the Air Staff in regard to the employment of aircraft for administrative purposes, and argues that, if unfortunate consequences have attended aeroplane action in Mesopotamia it has been due not to their use, but to their misuse, at the instance of the Civil authorities. Mr. Churchill endorses Sir II. Trenchard&apos;s criticisms, and reproaches Sir A. Wilson with attempting to blame others for the consequences of his own mistakes.I cannot but think that some misapprehension has arisen. I do not read Sir A. Wilson&apos;s words as conveying a charge against the policy of the Air Staff or as an indictment of the use of aircraft as a general proposition. I think that his intention is to take blame upon himself in so far as there is any question of blame-not to impute it to others; and that his abbreviated phrase &quot; use of aeroplanes &quot; is meant to signify, not the policy of employing aeroplanes, but the particular manner in which they have actually been employed in Mesopotamia. In other words he pleads guilty in some degree to the &quot; misuse &quot; of which the Air Staff complain. His whole telegram is an attempt to review the factors of the situation in the frankest spirit, not omitting or slurring over the points on which he himself may be considered to have shown a lack of administrative prudence.10th September 1920. E. S. M.2260     100 9.20
