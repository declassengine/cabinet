This Document is the Property of /*&quot; g 4 3Hjs Britannic Majesty^s Cf   rflmftnt^the Secretary cf State for India. SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 27th August ] 920.The following is the weekly telegram : Gandhi and Shaukat Ali toured Madras, and after special congress contemplate tour in Bihar and Orissa and United Provinces. In Madras secured few more resignations of titles by bullying tactics. Gandhi on one &quot;occasion refusing to eat or speak with hosts until he received four resignations. Shaukat Ali inciting younger enthusiasts to bring pressure to bear by means of public insult and humiliation. These tactics expected to produce reaction. Gandki&apos;s speeches have contained nothing exceptionally violent, though inherently seditious and disloyal. Nothing has been clone by Government of Madras to interfere with tour. Shaukat Ali makes little concealment of his approbation of stronger measures if Gaudhi&apos;s programme of non-violence fails.Bombay. Provincial Congress adopted non-co-operation. Detailed reports regarding resignations in Sincl by reason of Sir Mahbub Shah&apos;s arrest show 19 clerks, (? two) teachers, (? six honorary teachers), five peons, 10 honorary magistrates, 10 gun licensees, 12 students. Highest officer resigning one assistant surgeon. In Ahmadabad, Shaukat Ali in canvassing resignations met with blank refusal. He advocates Hijrat followed by Jehad conjointly with Central (? organisation of) Hijrat including triumphal procession of Muhajarin, but closing of frontiers and reports given, by Muhajarin returning in, large numbers from Afghanistan of hardships endured on way, treatment received and prohibition against participation in profession will largely nullify this. Central Khilafat Committee willing to hold conference with Calcutta at time of special congress (? and) league. They may (? reiterate parlia-meutary enthusiasm). Abdullah Haroon of Karachi suggested turning Aligarh students into itinerant preachers in likely event of college closing through internal pressure on authorities to refuse Government.gran t-in-aicl.Sind. Pir Mahbub Shah signed unconditional renunciation and no conditions . imposed on him under section 401 C.P.C. on release. Declaration as follows : &quot; What &quot; I am reported to have said at Tando Mohamed meeting (? is not) true. Having &quot; repented, I pray that Government will be pleased to pardon me for my offence. &quot;I promise for the future not to make any speeches of this kind, and to remain &quot; obedient and loyal to the Government.&quot;Bengal. Considerable diversity of opinion as to co-operation, and when principle adopted of resolutions, silent as to practice.United Provinces. Provincial Khilafat Deputation started touring. Local attempts to induce honorary magistrates and title holders to resign, but efforts failed save three or four cases. Growing bitterness in tone of Press and withdrawal of Indian troops from Mesopotamia urged.United Provinces Provincial Congress adopted non-co-operation and resolved to boycott His Royal Highness The Duke of Connaught, but it is doubtful how far this is not mere bluflBihar a.nrl Orissa. Provincial Khilafat Committee decided to push Hijrat programme, hopeless of non-co-operation in province being realised and Hijrat Committee formed. Wild rumours regarding intending Muhajarin in circulation. Actually 12 names registered. Hijrat lias no chance in Bihar and Orissa. Anticipated Mahomedans will, exercise right of Kurbani as usual.Delhi-Khilafat workers trying hard to persuade people of Delhi not to pay indemnity levied by local administration on city, and when property attached by Government not to buy it.north-West Frontier Province. Situation on Hazara border unsettled, and hostile demonstrations anticipated-due to Khilafat agitation and Hijrat excitement in Mansehra Tahsil. Flying column sent from Abbottabad and detachments of troops as prompt action necessary reported in Mansehra Tahsil, where at instigation of Maulvi Muhammad Isbag and other ringleaders agitation assumed dangerous proportions. Orders issued by C,C. to invoke aid of Nawab of Amb, and 10  2197     100. 9.20
arrest Ishag and the ringleaders if necessary, and in any case not to allow them to escape over border. Latest report that situation greatly improved by presence of troops-all quiet.2. Generally speaking, non-co-operation nominally adopted in principle by most Provincial Committees, hut not likely to be taken up in practice owing to wide divergence from Gandhi and Khilafat Committee on the one hand and bulk of Nationalist objection on the other. Consideration of inconvenient details will be avoided. We have already asked Local Governments to prosecute persons inciting to violence [or attempting to seduce (troops), and we ipropose to follow this up by a letter, again urging necessity of vigorous action in this direction. Government of Bombay has prosecuted three or four persons as such, and we believe Punjab Government contemplate similar action against some Provincial agitators.3. The Viceroy&apos;s opening speech at the autumn session, of which a summary was telegraphed home by reuter on 20th instant well received, and more friendly feeling in air, Patel and Malaviya being absent. Press has commented favourably on Viceroy&apos;s-plea for peace though Extremist organs harp on point that no peace possible till Punjab officers punished and Khilafat wrongs righted.
