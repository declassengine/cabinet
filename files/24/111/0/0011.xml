PART 1-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The centre of interest has shifted more to the industrial side of the labour situation. The result of the ballot of the Miners&apos; Federation on a strike to enforce the demand for reduced prices and increased wages will be officially declared on the 30th;August. The Food Controller made a statement to the Press, on the 24th August, on the preparations which are being made by the Government to maintain the food supply in the event of the ballot being favourable to a strike. A national crisis has also arisen in the engineering industry out of the Penistone dispute. In both instances, other powerful unions will be seriously affected, and there are indications that an attempt may be made by these unions to bring some influence to bear in the interests of industrial peace.On the political side the National Council of Action have adopted for the present a waiting policy. At the same time, much activity is being devoted to the organisation of demonstrations and the perfecting of local machinery.The one-day strike organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Labour Housing Association against the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restric-tions) Act seems to have obtained considerable support. It remains to he seen, however, whether this policy of protest will be expanded into an organised refusal to pay the legal increases in rent.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and Merchant Seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 13th August was 135,439, made up of 134,808 lodged by men and 631 by women. On the 6th August there were 110,168 policies current, 109,538 for men and 630 for women.On the 13th August, 78,148 unemployment books, 54,693 for males and 23,455 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Corn-pared with the previous week, when there were 56,008 books lodged by males and 22,607 by females, the total decrease is 467.The total for live registers for all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 293.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Labour and Russia. Interest in the proceedings of the National Council of Action during the earlier part of the week was largely eclipsed by the publication, on the 19th August, of a series of wireless messages, intercepted by the Admiralty, which passed between MM. Litvinorl and Tchitcherin, from February to July, on the subject of the Daily Herald. On the 22nd August, however, a large number of &quot; Peace with Russia &quot; demonstrations were held in various parts, at which resolutions were carried pledging the demonstrators to^carry out loyally any instructions which the National Council of Action deemed it necessary to issue to prevent war, open or otherwise, between the British and the Soviet Governments, and to secure frank recognition of the latter.1; The day wasjxiade an occasion by the Daily Herald for the issue of another special Sunday^edition.   %jThe organisation of local councils of action has been progressing in various centres. In many places, as, for example, London and Birmingham, local co-operative societies have secured representation. It is significant that in Halifax and Sheffield, the local organisations of the National Shop Stewards&apos; Movement have publicly co-operated with the local Trades and Labour Councils in convening meetings for the formation of local councils.  A con-
ference of representatives of councils of action in the north-east of England was held, in Newcastle on the 21st August, when a north-eastern district council was formed, to include representatives of the National Union of Ex-Service Men as well as of local councils of action.Although the Labour movement showed marked unanimity in forming the Council of Action and sanctioning its preliminary proceedings, divergencies of view are becoming manifest over the question of its permanent or temporary character, and over the issue of industrial or political action. The Council have a mandate from the trade unions to exercise executive powers only on two issues, opposition to war measures and recognition of the Soviet republic. The Daily Herald, however, has been bringing the Council into definite connection with its campaign for a general labour staff, and suggests that the Council should remain in being to co-ordinate labour activities, in view of the present situation in the mining, engineering and gas industries. Mr. H. Gosling is reported to have intimated that a proposal may be mooted at the Trades Union Congress in September for merging the Council in a permanent Committee of Control, to follow all economic and political affairs of national interest. Mr. W. Adamson, M.P., chairman of the National Council, speaking at the Trafalgar Square demonstration on the 22nd August, said that it was possible that the Council would be continued afterwards for other tasks that required to be completed in this country. On the other hand Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P., has recorded his opinion that the Council should be used only for the supreme object for which it was constituted, to prevent any further attempt at European war, and that it would overreach itself if it attempted to make itself a permanent body. Both Mr. F. Hodges and Mr. W. Brace, M.P., have emphasised its temporary character, the latter stating that &quot;if it is proposed that in future power should be handed over by the unions to such a body, chaos and disruption will follow inevitably.&quot; Mr. Herbert Smith, president of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, speaking at Thurcroft on the 21st August, repudiated direct action, and declared that the Council had served its purpose and done its work. The delegates of the Leicestershire Miners&apos; Association are reported to have opposed the formation of a local council of action at Coalville, Mr. John Baker, president of the Association, claiming that they had no mandate from the miners and declining to support any attempt to defeat the Government by direct action.At a meeting of the Manchester and Salford Trades and Labour Council on the 18th, to appoint representatives to a local council of action, the fear was expressed that the National Council might remain in being when the Russo-Polish crisis had ended, and might interfere with trade union autonomy. In reply, the chairman stated that the Council had been appointed to deal with the situation as it existed between the Allies and Russia, and that he could give a guarantee that only this question would be involved.   &apos;Of the national socialist bodies, the National Administrative Council of the Independent Labour Party have issued a manifesto urging the party membership to give the fullest possible support to the National Council of Action, and instructing branches, where neces-sary, to take the initiative in forming local councils. The Social Democratic Federation, however, while supporting the proposal for a general cessation of work as a last resort, to prevent the employment of British armed forces, are somewhat suspicious of the Council of Action, and strongly hold that direct action should be expressly limited to the avoidance of war, and not employed to enforce the recognition of the Soviet Government. The Communist Party-the British Section of the Third International urge &quot;their members to secure election to local councils and to develop the potentialities of these bodies to the full. The activity of the unofficial shop stewards in Sheffield and district, referred to above, should be noted in this connection.Labour and Ireland. It is understood that the executive committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners are demanding the immediate reinstatement of those members of the society expelled by Unionist workers from the Belfast shipyards, and intimate that, unless a satisfactory reply is received from the firms concerned within a few days, all members will be withdrawn from the workshops involved. Meetings of various shipyard trades among the employees of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Ltd., however, were held on the 19th August, when resolutions were adopted affirming their determination to refuse to work with any men who were members of, or in sympathy with, any Sinn Fein organisation in Ireland, until these bodies abandoned their policy of outrage.Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. It is estimated that about. 300,000 workers were idle in Scotland, on the 23rd August, in the demonstration strike organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Labour Housing
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 200.Association. These included miners, textile workers, steel workers, dockers, building trades operatives, vehicle workers, general workers and many others. Most unions whose members were thus officially on strike are affiliated to the Scottish Trades Union Congress, and voted in favour of a strike on the recommendation of the Congress. The Glasgow bakers were the only exception of note, as on a ballot the necessary two-thirds majority to strike was not obtained, and they remained at work. In other centres the bakers came out.Demonstrations were held in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leith and Dundee, at which resolutions were passed condemning the Act, and pledging the demonstrators to resist any demands made under it. In Glasgow, a resolution was carried calling upon the Scottish Labour Housing Association to convene a further national conference, in order that the agitation may be continued on organised lines.Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill-The departmental committee to investigate the position of women&apos;s labour under the shift system has been appointed by the Home Secretary, and further consideration of the Bill is postponed until the committee have reported.* The members are Mr. T. W. H. Inskip, C.B.E., K.C., M.P., chairman, Mr. W. A. Appleton, general secretary, General Federation of Trade Unions, Mrs. D Coleman, M.D., Sir Malcolm Delevingne, K.C.B., of the Home Office, Miss F. Durham, Mr. F. W. Mallalieu, M.P., and Miss Julia Varley, of the Workers&apos; Union. Miss F. I. Taylor, of the Factory Department of the Home Office, will act as secretary. The terms of reference are &quot; to consider whether it is desirable that the Factory and Work-shop Acts should be so amended as to allow women and young persons to be employed on the system of two day-shifts, and if so, what should be the length of the shifts; and the time for beginning and ceasing work.&quot; Criticism of the composition of the committee as entirely unrepresentative of the workers concerned has appeared in various Labour papers.Housing. The position remains much the same. The Governments proposals will be considered again by the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives at the end of the month.On the 16th August the Ministry of Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which, among other things, enables local authorities to hire compulsorily premises suitable for the housing of the working classes, was introduced. It provides that such houses may be taken over by local authorities with the sanction of the Ministry of Health, when they have been unoccupied for not less than three months.Labour and Co-operative Co-ordination. Dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Co-operative Wholesale Society towards political activity within the co-operative move-ment and towards a closer alliance with the Labour Party, led the Edmonton, Manchester, Salford, Stockport and Stratford societies to summon an unofficial conference at Derby on the 21st August, which-was attended by about 130 delegates from retail societies in various parts. The relations of thejretail societies to the Wholesale Society were discussed, and the opinion was expressed that the retail societies should exercise more fully their powers of supervision, to ensure that the policy decided by the Co-operative Congress shall be that of the whole movement. No agreement on the question of closer relations with the Labour Party, and it was decided to refer this matter back to the branches. It is understood that the National Committee of the Co-operative Party may shortly meet the directors of the Wholesale Society with a view to arriving at some compromise on the matters at issue:Government Dockyards. An official statement was issued at Devonport on the 18th August to the effect that, in view of the work in hand and in prospect, the discharge of workmen from the dockyard would be suspended, and that it was expected that no further discharges would be necessary this year. Similar orders have been issued by the Admiralty at Sheerness and Portsmouth. At the latter place it is reported that the Admiralty has adopted a programme of work which will obviate further dismissals in the engineering and shipbuilding trades throughout the winter.Industrial and Other Organisations.Trades Union Congress. The principal item on&quot; the agenda of the Congresst meeting at Portsmouth on the 6th September is the proposal to set up a General. Council
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 2, lOth July, p, ii.in the place of the existing Parliamentary Committee. The details were published some time ago in an interim report of the Trade Union Co-ordination Committee,* which will be presented as it stands to the Congress, together with an amendment suggested by the National Federation of Women Workers, and a second by the National Union of Clerks. The first proposes to increase the members of the Council from 30 to 32 by the addition of two women, each union containing women members to be entitled to nominate a woman representative separately. The second suggests that the principle of proportional representation be adopted in the election of the Council.Other motions deal with political action, the cost of living, and equal pay for equal work. A resolution put forward by the Horticultural Workers&apos; Union is that immediate action be taken to prevent workers who. have obtained a shorter working week through their trade unions, utilising their leisure in entering into competition with workers in other industries at rates much below the standard prevailing in these industries.Dockers&apos; Amalgamation. It is reported that&quot; the negotiations for the closer linking up of the unions concerned in dock labour have been carried a step further. At a conference in London the decision to amalgamate was finally taken, and it was agreed that the draft constitution should be drawn up by a committee of 14, one from each of the following unions : The Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union ; the National Union of Dock Labourers ; the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers ; the Shipping Guild (Liverpool); the National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union (Swansea) ; the National Union of Dock, Wharves and Shipping Staffs (London); the Amalgamated Stevedores&apos; Labour Protection League (London); the Cardiff, Penarth and Barry Coal Trimmers&apos; Union; the Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen (London); the North of England Trimmers&apos; and Teemers&apos; Association; the National Union of Ships&apos; Clerks, Grain Weighers and Coal Meters ; the Mersey River and Canals Watermen&apos;s Association; and the Tyne and the Weaver Watermen&apos;s Associations.It was suggested that the new union should be organised in departments to deal with the very different kinds of labour concerned, each department to have a National Com-mittee acting in an advisory capacity, whose function would be to frame policy in regard to wages.Amalgamated Engineering Union. It is understood that as a result of the first national conference of the Amalgamated Engineering Union held at York, on the 11th August, a National Advisory Committee has been appointed to deal with members in railway workshops with line committees for each railway system.The United Operative Plumbers&apos; and Domestic Engineers&apos; Association are considering amalgamation with the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and a joint sub-committee of the executive councils have been appointed to submit recommendations, with a view to taking the votes of the members concerned. The Amalgamated Society of Scale, Beam and Weighing Machine Makers have decided against amalgamation at present.National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. The annual conference of this federation was held at Scarborough on the 19th, 20th and 21st August. The chief matters discussed were the Governments proposals for the expediting of house building, and the introduction of the guild principle. A resolution was passed approving the principle of the Building Guilds and recommending their development along national lines. The conference expressed afresh the determination of operatives throughout the trade to resist the introduction of dilution or payment by results. No decision on the Government - proposals was reached, and the conference adjourned until the 31st August, by which time it is expected that the Cabinefs reply to the operatives&apos; counter-proposals will have been received.National Federation of General Workers. The federation held their annual conference at Oriel College, Oxford, on the 19th and 20th August. Mr. J. R. Clynes, who presided, urged the need for increased production as the only means of reducing the cost of living and procuring an advance in real wages. One of the means suggested for steadying the prices of foodstuffs was an alteration in the duration of awards issued by the Industrial Court, so that periodic claims should be made every six months instead of every four. This proposal was put forward by the executive council, whose report was discussed in private.On the Russo-Polish crisis, a conference passed a resolution recording emphatic protest against the export of arms to Poland, and demanding the abolition of secret diplomacy.
* The union&apos;s policy differs from that of the Scottish Labour Housing Association, as the latter only pro-pose a refusal to pay the legal increases in rent as a protest against the Increase of Eent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act.The National Alliance of Employers and Employed and the Industrial League and Council-At a conference, on the 20th August, of representatives of the National Alliance of Employers and Employed and of the Industrial League and Council, it was decided to recommend the amalgamation of these -two bodies. It is understood that the executives will meet shortly to work out the details. . - *Trade Union Topics.Post Office Engineering Union. The recent ballot of the Post Office Engineering Union for the establishment of a strike fund shows a vote of 9,926 in favour and 4,957 against. The rules provide for strike pay at the rate of 15s. per week, and the payment of like sums &quot; for such allied purposes as may subsequently be defined by the Council.&quot;Ex-Service Men.Employment of Ex-Service Men A campaign is now under way for the resettlement of officers and ex-Service men still unemployed. The King has written to the Lords Lieutenant, the Lord Mayor of London, and the Lord Mayors and Lord Provosts of the other chief cities, expressing his anxiety that every effort should be made in support of Earl Haig&apos;s recent appeal, and asking to be informed of local particulars of the ex-Service men still unemployed and the steps taken to deal with such cases.In addition to the Lord Mayor of London&apos;s conference on the 8th September, the Lord Mayor of Manchester is calling a meeting of representative citizens on the 30th August to discuss practical measures. It is reported that the British Commonwealth Union propose to devote their machinery, throughout September, to focussing public attention on the problem.Mine Simpers&apos; Qo-operative Trawling Society, Ltd. On the 23rd August, the Minister addressed at Grimsby the first of a series of public meetings at the principal fishing ports, / to make known the Mine Sweepers&apos; Co-operative Trawling Society, Ltd. The Society have arranged to purchase some 200 trawlers from the Admiralty, in fulfilment of the scheme for the resettlement of ex-Service fishermen. The fleet will operate from all the principal trawling ports in the United Kingdom. It will be self-supporting, and will he worked on co-operative lines in the sole interests of the members. Ex-Service men, whether fishermen or not, and all fishermen and other grades in the fishing industry, together with employees of the Society, are eligible for membership; As far as practicable the Society will employ suitable ex-Service men. The scheme has, apparently, met with some objection from private trawler owners, but is supported by the officials of the National Union of British Fishermen.  The secretary is Mr. Albert Shaw, 110, Leman Street, E. 1.National Union of Ex-Service Men. This union&apos;s campaign for a &quot; rent strike &quot; against high prices has found some support in Glasgow, the Manchester area, South Wales, Notting-hamshire, and certain London districts, notably Camberwell, Southwark, Holloway and Hackney. The union originally proposed to announce the date of the strike on the 27th&quot; August, but have now decided to announce it later, at about 1\ hours&apos; notice. They are at present collecting signatures to pledge forms, the signatories engaging to refuse to pay any rent* until the general cost of living is reduced by a fifth. The Rent Strike Committee have fixed provisionally a minimum of 2,000,000 pledges as necessary to warrant the proclamation of a strike.International Relations of Labour.International Federation of Agricultural Workers.-A.ri international congress of agri-cultural workers&apos; organisations was held at Amsterdam from the 17th to the 20th August. Delegates from the National Union of Agricultural Workers, the Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union and the agricultural section of the Workers&apos; Union represented Great Britain. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Belgium and Italy were among the other countries represented.The congress decided to establish an International Federation of Agricultural Workers with headquarters in Holland.&apos; M. Hienstra (Holland) was appointed general secretary. Mr. W. R. Smith, M.P., president of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, was elected a member of the executive committee.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Quarry Workers (Bethesda). On the 14th August, workers at the Penrhyn quarries, Bethesda, gave fourteen days&apos; notice to strike unless a number of men are re-engaged who were dismissed because they failed to earn the minimum wage.Mercantile Marine. It is reported that officers, engineers, sailors and firemen have formulated demands for higher pay. The claims will come before the National Maritime Board, who are to begin to meet not later than the 19th September.Gas Workers (National). Representatives of the unions affiliated to the National Federation of General Workers, who are concerned in the gas workers&apos; dispute, met at Oxford on the 18th August, to consider a strike ballot in support of their claim for a further advance of Is. per day or shift. It was resolved that, as &quot; zoneing &quot; and grading proposals are to be put forward to meet the claims, the Negotiating Committee be instructed to meet the employers on this issue, on the understanding that an agreement shall be reached as soon as possible.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Electricians (Penistone). A strike began at the Penistone works of Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., Ltd., on the 2nd July, owing to the refusal of one man to resume his member-ship of the Electrical Trades Union, which he resigned on promotion to foreman. The Electrical Trades Union therefore withdrew their members, and other workers have been rendered idle. At the beginning of August the dispute was referred to the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations. Efforts to arrive at a settlement having failed, the employers&apos; federation have decided to issue lock-out notices on the 28th August, expiring on the 4th September, to all members of the union employed by federated firms. The employers deny the union&apos;s right to insist that all electrical foremen should be compelled to join the union. Members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, and the National Federation of General Workers, will be affected if the lock-out takes place.Platers&apos; Helpers (Clyde District). A strike of about 400 platers&apos; helpers began on the 6th August in the shipyards of Messrs. Denny Bros., Dumbarton, and Messrs. Beardmore &amp; Co., Ltd., Dalmuir. Under Award No. 405 of the Industrial Court it was laid down that, in accordance with pre-war practice, platers&apos; helpers should he paid by the platers and not by the employers. The helpers, who are paid by the piece-work platers in these yards on an hourly basis; have received an advance of only 35. 9^. per week. They claim that the award entitles them to l^d. per hour, giving 5s. lO^d. for a 47-hour week. The Scottish branch of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, on behalf of the helpers, claimed that most of the piece-work platers in the West of Scotland are paying the full award. It has since been reported that the Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers have issued instructions to platers throughout* This claim is not allowable under the terms of the Peace Treaty, the International Labour Conference being composed of four representatives of each of the members of the League of Nations, two of whom shall be Government delegates, and the two others delegates representing, respectively, the employers and the workpeople of each of the members.  (Art. 389.)It is reported that a resolution was passed in favour of the nationalisation of land and agriculture, and that measures were discussed for controlling the importation of foreign agricultural labour in consequence of its lowering effect on the landworkers&apos; standard of living, and for obtaining the application of the Conventions of theWashington International Labour Conference to agricultural labour. Mr. W. R. Smith has stated that the Federation have resolved to make determined representations to the International Labour Office to obtain admittance as a body to the International Labour Conference at Geneva in 1921, in order to secure protective measures for workers on the land.*On the subject of the Polish crisis, a resolution was unanimously carried calling on -all affiliated societies to use all means at their disposal to prevent the outbreak of a new world war.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.the Clyde district that, from the 18th August, all helpers are to receive an advance of 3s. 9d. per week, instead of the 5s. 10jc?. conceded since the issue of the award. The National Amalgamated Union of Labour have instructed members who receive reduced wages to tender notices to cease work.Shipwrights (Southampton). Shipwrights at Southampton, employed on refitting trawlers used during the war as mine-sweepers, struck on the 18th August, over a demarcation dispute with the joiners.Seamen (Glasgow and Irish Ports). Seamen and firemen employed on the cross-channel trade between Glasgow and the northern Irish ports ceased work on the 13th August. It is reported that several questions in dispute, including wages and manning, had been under negotiation for some time. On the 13th the men demanded an immediate settlement on all points, and as this was not reached, they refused to work the ships. The employers decline to negotiate as long as the men remain on strike.Settlements and Agreements.Building Trades Operatives (South-Western District). On the failure of the National Conciliation Board to reach a settlement of the South-Western building trades operatives demands,* local negotiations have taken place. The terms suggested have been accepted on a ballot of the operatives.  Certain details remain to be settled.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Department Section of the Report, pp. 306 to 308.]* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 7,14th August, p. 238.
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies and placings during the week ending the 13th August:-	-Men.

The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 97 as regards men and a decrease of 980 in respect of women. All the divisions show increases in the men&apos;s register, and all, except the South-Western Division, in the women&apos;s register.Men&apos;s Employment.General Outlook. In the shipbuilding and allied industries, the situation has undergone no appreciable change. On the Tyne and in the Wearside area several firms have paid off a number of employees owing to shortage of material. On the Tees a shortage of material, due to railway congestion, has also been felt, and a number of platers, riveters and others have been thrown temporarily out of employment. In the Hartlepools area a large number of ship-repair workers have been paid off owing to general slackness, and steel workers have been suspended pending the installation of modern labour-saving plant.From the North-Western Division, except in certain, districts where special conditions obtain, such as Liverpool, no appreciable increase in unemployment is reported. As regards engineering, disquieting symptoms are still presented, and until the wages dispute is settled little improvement can be looked for. The industry was seriously dislocated by the ironfounders&apos; dispute of last year, and the consequent shortage of castings has prevented the absorption of fitters and machine workers. The prevailing unrest accentuates the position, and the effect is being felt in other industries. No appreciable change is as yet observable in the manufacturing section of the cotton industry, although Blackburn, where the depression has been largely felt, again report improvement.In the leather, boot and shoe, hosiery, hollow-ware and lace trades, depression, more or less marked, still continues. Employment at the Liverpool Docks last week was at a lower level than for a number of years, but is beginning to show an upward tendency. There are local indications of depression in the saw-milling and oil-milling industries.Industrial Developments. Brighton report that Messrs. Slack &amp; Brownlow, Manchester, are erecting a factory at NewhaVen for the manufacture of pottery. Messrs. Hoyle, Robson, Barnett &amp; Co., Bill Quay, paint manufacturers, are extending their premises. Messrs. R. B. Harrison &amp; Son, Bill Quay, ship-repairers, have added two extra berths for building ships. At Rutherglen, Messrs. Redpath, Brown &amp; Co., Ltd., have acquired 20 acres upon which they propose to erect steel construction works.
Labour Reductions. Croydon report that the Army Ordnance Corps at Mitcham have discharged 70 men. At Dartford Messrs. J. &amp; E. Hall, Ltd., have again discharged a number of fitters and turners, and Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., have completely closed down their machine shop. At Goole upwards of 700 dockers are unemployed out of a total of 1,000. The Douglas Bank Colliery Co., Wigan, have discharged 150 workers owing to one of their mines having become exhausted. The Blyth Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Ltd., have paid off 300 men. The Albion Motor Car Co., Scotstoun, are dispensing with 300 workers.&apos;Shortage of Labour. In London the demand for bricklayers continues abnormal. Plasterers are difficult to get and joiners are in great request. There has been a distinct revival in the decorating trade, and a large number of painters have been placed in employment. There is still a considerable amount of unemployment among plumbers, hot-water fitters, and electricians. The demand for builders&apos; labourers is small, in consequence, in some degree, of the greater use of machinery on public works. In the country there is still a marked demand for practically all types of skilled building operatives, especially bricklayers.There is also an unsatisfied demand for moulders and coremakers, shipwrights, sheet metal workers, coach and wagon makers and repairers, and wheelwrights.Shortage of Material Ponders End report that the Edison Swan Electric Co., Ltd., suffer from a shortage of porcelain, which before the war was largely obtained from Germany and Austria. At Coventry the motor and engineering trades are still very slack, owing in the main to a shortage of material. At Armley, a shortage of castings in the engineering trade is the cause of considerable unemployment. Coatbridge again report a shortage of oxygen and raw material for the local tube and boiler works, and work in the Chepstow shipyards is being held up by lack of material.Transport Difficulties. At Newport, Mon., owing to the strike of engine fitters, the Great &quot;Western Railway have been unable to give clearance to the Rogerstone Works of Messrs. Gue&quot;st Keen &amp; Nettlefolds, Ltd. This has caused a complete stoppage of work, by which 1,200 men have been affected.&quot; Women&apos;&apos;s Employment.General Industrial Situation.&apos; Reports generally draw attention to the prevailing, industrial depression. Some Exchanges report that their registers are rising, but many factories are working short time, and thus avoid discharges.In the North-Western Division the position in the cotton trade is unchanged. The improvement in the Blackburn locality gives every indication of being maintained. In the Burnley area there is little prospect of immediate betterment. At Preston the holiday stoppage of several cotton mills is likely to be extended. Nevertheless the demand for cotton operatives, principally weavers, throughout the division is still much greater than the supply. Slackness in the bleaching trade continues at Chorley, infthe rubber trade and among overall machinists at Openshaw and Salford, and in the slipper industry at Rawtenstall.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division the depression in the staple industries has spread to the ancillary trades, and in the textile industry the boom has definitely ended. Other industries affected by trade depression and holidays are lace, hosiery, wholesale clothing, blouse and shirt making, boot making and leather currying.In Scotland slackness is reported in the textile industry, and the demand for weavers is lessening. An unsatisfied demand is still indicated, however, by the fact that, at Galashiels, the manager of a tweed mill has asked for 10 women to train as weavers, at 25s. per week during training. Hosiery works in Irvine are reported to be slack owing to lack of raw material, and the slackness in the jute trade in Dundee continues.In Glasgow there is said to be a general lull in manufacturing, although there is still a demand for experienced workers in a variety of trades. Glasgow require printing trade workers; Motherwell, French polishers and tailoresses; Aberdeen, dressmakers, paper workers and hosiery workers.Recruiting for fruit pickers has been hampered by increased railway fares and wet weather. Up to the 6th August, 1,200 fruit pickers had been placed at Blairgowrie, and 1,500 at Auchterarder.The general situation in the South Midlands and. Eastern Division remains the same. At Leicester large numbers of boot and hosiery workers have not resumed since the August Bank holidays, and very few factories are running full time.  There is no prospect of
immediate improvement. At Braintree the silk and crepe factories have discharged 100 women. The straw hat trade is still slack at Luton but a recovery is expected shortly. At Bedford, Messrs. Peek, Erean &amp; Co., Ltd., have been recruiting factory workers. Their demand is now fully satisfied.Reports of slackness in the rubber works at Aston, the jewellery trade at Birmingham, the silk industry at Leek and the leather works at Walsall continue to be received. Women are also being discharged from factories in Coventry. At Selly Oak many metal machinists have been discharged.Stoke-on-Trent and Burslem report that the pottery factories are busy. An active season and a considerable demand for workers is expected.-The general slackness in all the factory areas of London continues unabated, but some revival in the needlework trades and an increased number of orders for clothing machinists are reported from Great Marlborough Street and Whitechapel, and .an increased demand for blouse machinists from Leyton and Tottenham. Deptford report a rise in the live register, which now stands at over 1,000.  The King&apos;s Cross register is also rising.At Maidstone the number of applications for hop picking is increasing. These workers will be absorbed at the beginning of September. At Sheerness the work of breaking down gas masks at Queenborough will absorb all factory workers on the register.In the Northern, South-Western and Wales Divisions, where there are few industrial openings for women, the general situation is unchanged.NURSES&apos; DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT COMMITTEE.The work of this committee continues to develop, and applications to the committees for nurses increase. Recent placings include the matron-in-chief of a neurological hospital for discharged soldiers in Liverpool; a central sister for the Ranyard Mission ; an assistant matron for the Caterham Mental Hospital; a matron for St. Edith&apos;s School, Bracldey; and a housekeeping sister for Gilford House, Roehampton. Maternity nurses have been found for the Holloway Prison Hospital and a school nurse has been provided for the London County Council. A number of staff and assistant nurses have been found for other institutions.  The committee have also sent three nurses overseas. *LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. The Deptford and Woolwich Committee suggest that the Greenwich Borough Council should be asked to co-operate with the Deptford Borough Council in clearing the mud-banks in the Ravensbourne, which would provide work for a number of the workpeople unemployed in the area, and is necessary for public health.The Dartford Committee recommend that all Borough Councils, Urban District Councils and Rural District Councils should be approached with a request that contracts should be given as far as. possible to local firms, with a proviso that local labour should be employed.The Gainsborough Committee, in conjunction with the Juvenile Employment Committee, have induced the Urban District Council to appoint a Development Com-mittee, to endeavour to attract new industries.Training. The Oxford Committee have decided to make investigations as to the possibilities of training ex-Service men in hairdressing. and picture-frame making.Ex-Service Men. The question of substituting ex-Service men for women is still prominent in the work of committees. The Margate Committee have recommended that steps should be taken to replace women railway clerks and ticket collectors by ex-Service men, except where they are the sole support of their home. Falkirk have appointed a deputation to interview the manager of the Falkirk and District Tramway Co. on replacing women employees by ex-Service men. A deputation from the Burnley Committee met the committee of the Burnley and District Weavers, Winders and Beamers&apos; Association; the committee promised that disabled men should have a prior claim when vacancies occurred in the collecting staff, although arrangements for full-time collectors could not be made.Publicity. An appreciable number of committees are taking advantage of the recent extension of the arrangements enabling them to undertake publicity along certain lines.

The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit at local offices during the week ending the 6th August was 36,729, involving an amount of  18,415 12s. lOd.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 18th August, 19,414 certificates have been issued to employers enrolled under the Scheme. These employers control staffs amounting to 3,149,369, and the undertakings signed by them cover 185,326 disabled ex-Service men.The Minister has addressed a letter to all members of Parliament asking them to issue an appeal to those employers in their constituencies who have not yet adopted the Scheme. It has been arranged that Divisional Controllers shall inform the members of Parliament in their division of the number of employers on the Roll, the number of disabled men&apos;they employ, the number of such men still unemployed, and the number of employers who might still reasonably be expected to give undertakings in each constituency.Placings. \At Birmingham two one-legged men have been placed as telephone operators and a one-armed man as lift attendant.Four disabled men at Llanelly have been placed at the Pembrey Factory as safety service men at  4 per week.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Lincolnshire Juvenile Advisory Committee. The organisation of the work in the County of Holland is now complete. The main committee sit at Boston, and sub-committees for Boston, Crowland, Dorrington, Holbeach, Long Sutton and Spalding have now held their first meetings. The areas concerned are agricultural, but in industries such as building, blacksmithing and others usually carried on in country villages there appeared to be opportunities for training. Agricultural work is largely casual, and high rates of wages are to be obtained in the busy season, boys and girls of 14 or 15 earning 6s. or 7s. per day.Employment of Boys as Golf Caddies. -This question came before the Romford Juvenile Advisory Committee at their last meeting. It was decided that the secretary of the local club be asked to employ ex-Service men in place of boys.Miscellaneous. The question of the method of payment of branch managers has been considered by the Redkill Committee, who consider the present method unsatisfactory in view of the fact that, according to information given to them, the larger the number of men placed by a branch manager, the less remuneration he receives.
APPOINTMENTS DEPARTMENT.GENERAL.The Minister has appointed Captain F. E. McClellan, O.B.E., to be Controller of the Appointments Department in succession to Sir Robert Grillan, K.C.S.I.

The Exeter and Lowestoft Juvenile Employment Committees have secured amendments to the draft by-laws prepared by the local authorities. At Exeter the committee have secured the addition of clauses providing for medical re-examination of street traders within six months of their taking up this work, and ensuring the provision of suitable clothes in necessitous cases. A clause permitting street trading by girls under 16 in company with their parents has been withdrawn at the suggestion of the committee. At Lowestoft the Juvenile Employment Committee have secured a provision that all persons licensed for street trading, not engaged in full-time employment, shall be registered at the Juvenile Employment Bureau.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also be found on pages 286, 288, 290, 301, 302, and 308.]

Since the 1st May there have been substantial additions to the numbers in training, and a marked reduction in the waiting lists. By the end of July all the divisions except three had been supplied with training facilities of the factory type. The numbers of men in training on the 1st August vary from 4,188 in London to 301 in the South Midlands Division. The largest comparative increase is shown by the Essex and East Anglia Division, where the numbers were raised from 1,132 to 1,428. The London waiting list has in four months been reduced from 3,788 to 2,380.Improver ships. Steps have been taken by the staff of the Lancaster Street Factory, Birmingham, to meet the difficulty of finding improvers&apos; vacancies in workshops. Arrange-ments were made for a visit by the committee of the engineering foremen&apos;s society, whose members discussed the question with the factory staff and with a representative irom headquarters. One of the committee from the works of the Austin Motor Co., Ltd., declared himself in favour of paying the men the full district rate immediately, without requiring them to pass through the improVership stage. He was convinced that he would have less trouble with the other men in the shops if this course could be adopted. This visit made the objects of factory instruction known to an influential set of men with very little previous knowledge of the subject, and it was encouraging to find that their general impression was entirely favourable.Government Instructional Factories-Trie, Coventry Government Instructional Fac-tory has advanced steadily, and there are now 120 men in training. Plans for four houses, to be erected on the Walker Estate, Newcastle, have now been received at the factory, and the work will soon be in full swing.
Ex-Service Men-continued.There are now 330 men in training at the Cardiff Factory, which was recently visited by Field-Marshal Earl Haig and Lady Haig, who showed much interest in the work of the meh in training and the system of instruction.Equipment and Supplies. The Central Stores received a large number of deliveries during the week, including woodworking, boot and shoe, plumbing, tailoring and plas-terers&apos; tools. Financial sanction has been obtained and an order placed for 25 sewing machines for the tailoring classes. The Supply Section are busy with supplies for the hostels and canteens at some of the newly opened Factories.Treasury Sanctions.Since the issue of the last Report the following proposals have received Treasury sanction: The undertaking of contracts to supply labour for housing work on which men being trained at Government Instructional Factories in the building trades can be employed, and the engagement of such skilled and semi-skilled labour as is necessarily incidental there oo.Expenditure upon alterations and adaptations of the King Albert Hospital, Hornsey, and power machinery therefor.The taking possession, under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, of part of the land occupied by Hare Hall Camp, Romford, and the expenditure upon equipping the huts standing on the land for the training of ex-Service men.The placing of men in training in tinsmithing for a period of eighteen months, under certain conditions as regards the learners&apos; wages payable by employers.Schemes Sanctioned.During the week 15 schemes, providing 388 places, have been sanctioned. Included in this number are 128 places for training in various branches of the building trade.National Trade Advisory Committees.   .Boot and Shoe. The Trade Board administrative, committee on training, on the 17th August, agreed to the formation of a class for six men at the Ministry of Pensions Con-convalescent Centre at Birmingham, and 27 applications for training were considered and approved.Local Technical Advisory Committees.Shipbuilding and Engineering. The inaugural meeting of the joint Local Technical Advisory Committee for Loughborough and Leicester agreed that the committee should visit the Loughborough Technical College at an early date, and should then consider whether, in view of their commitments to the Loughborough and Leicester men already being trained at the college, they would be justified in recommending further applicants for this area.Pottery. Local Technical Advisory Committees have been set up at Torquay, Bovey Tracey, and in London.WOMEN&apos;S TRAINING.In future this section of the Report will be issued monthly.APPRENTICES AND BOYS. INTERRUPTED APPRENTICESHIPS.Questions Affecting the Scheme.Wages.-The great majority of employers are well satisfied with the provisions of the scheme, and with the share in it which is taken by the State. The general opinion seems to be that without the scheme they could not have paid sufficient to attract back their apprentices, or that they could not have given them such good training as has bee a
provided. Some employers go so far as to say that the scheme &quot; has saved the situation in regard to the demobilised apprentices.&quot;The difficulties that may be caused by the attitude of the journeymen are well ilftis-trated by Messrs. Drummond Bros., Guildford, toolmakers. They state that under present labour conditions peace in the works is hanging on a hair, and if men who have lost time through service in the Forces receive more than they can earn, the rest will expect to be treated similarly. To bring returning apprentices under the scheme would cause great discontent, and might lead to a strike.A curious position has arisen at Camborne as a result of shortage of employment in the building industry. The journeymen, to avoid suspension, have agreed to accept less than the normal wages, so that their employers may take contracts at a reduced price. If apprentices&apos; wages continue to be calculated on the basis of the normal rates, they will receive more than the journeymen.Piece-Rates. In the course of adjusting certain claims in respect of an apprentice on piece-work, Messrs. Lubelski &amp; Co., Leeds, wholesale clothiers, made the statement that on piece-work the apprentice, a fltter-up, rarely works a full week, but makes  4 or  5 every week ; when he was tried on the ordinary datal rate, he never earned more than  2 in a full week.Period of Renewed Training and State Assistance. In the West Midlands, certain employers have protested that the period of State assistance is inadequate, and that to accept the apprentices as fully qualified at its close throws rather a strain upon the firm. Such protests, however, have not been numerous.The Scheme in Operation.Statistics-Uip to the 18th August, 41 schemes had been approved, and applications had been received in respect of all of them. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices for the week ending the 9th August, was 147, making a total of 42,932. The number Of applications received from apprentices was 180, making a total of 48,235.Up to the. 18th August agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 41,303 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 39,672 apprentices employed by 15,789 employers. Of these 14,193 were under the engineering scheme, and 6,588 under the building scheme. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 8,932.Applications. In recent weeks the excess of apprentices&apos; applications over those of employers has shown a decided tendency to increase. There appear to be several reasons for the increase. Slackness in certain industries is making it difficult for employers to bring additional apprentices under the scheme. Thus in engineering the percentage of excess has increased considerably, and this scheme accounts for more than one-third of all applications. Since the end of June, applications by apprentices in the clothing industry . have been about twice as numerous as those of employers. The excess of apprentices&apos; applications is also in part an inevitable result of the fact that, as the great majority of apprentices are brought under the scheme, the proportion of difficult cases tends to increase.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. Local headquarters for the Yorkshire and East Midlands area report instances of Local Employment Committees rejecting, without securing full information, applications which they would probably have accepted if they had been in possession of the full facts. Indeed, in one such case, that of a bootmaker at Northallerton, the matter was taken up by the local secretary of the Comrades of the Great War, and the apprentice was eventually brought under the scheme.Poaching of Apprentices. -At Gloucester a complaint has been made that the Gloucester Aircraft Co., Ltd., who are now engaged on cabinet making, have not only induced the journeymen of other firms to transfer to them, but have persuaded an apprentice under the scheme to break his agreement. Local headquarters believe, how-ever, that the firm, who are short of men, offered their terms of engagement in the ordinary way, and that the apprentice in question concealed from them his position under the scheme.Training in Operation: Progress. Local headquarters for the South Midlands and Eastern area report that some firms express appreciation of the visits of inspection byApprentices and Boys-Mntinued.
Apprentices and Boys-continued.officers of the department, and state that they are good for the apprentices as showing that the Government takes an interest in them.Messrs. R. Hedley, Newcastle, wood and stone carvers, have taken special pains to train an apprentice who has hit three fingers. The proprietor has devoted much of his own time to instructing and encouraging him&apos;, and has had special handles made for some of his tools. Local headquarters report that the apprenticed work is of a very high order, and that the firm feel more than repaid for what they have done.Pains seem also to be taken by Messrs. Earle&apos;s Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd.,, Hull. Local headquarters state that all apprentices who desire to improve their position aim at&quot; getting their ship,&quot; and the firm seem to encourage them, though possibly to their own detriment.Unemployment.--Local headquarters expect that in East Anglia the prevailing high rates of wages will lead to considerable unemployment, especially in the building industry, as the community is drawing in financially, and firms are feeling the pinch.Institutional Training. In Scotland negotiations are being carried on for the establishment of further special classes for returning apprentices during the coming autumn and winter. It is hoped that classes will be arranged at the Technical College, Paisley, the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, and the Robert Gordon Technical Institute, Aberdeen. Local headquarters point out that such classes assist apprentices at the most convenient period of the year, when the work of many firms is slack. At Darlington there are hopes that courses of institutional training will shortly be established.GENERAL TRAINING.Apprentices: Conditions and Training.Tailoring (Preston). At present lads entering the trade seem to receive no satisfactory guarantee of adequate training. Steps are required to ensure that prospective apprentices are suitable for the industry and realise its prospects, and that they are not placed with employers who lack proper facilities for teaching. It is suggested, both by employers and by employed, that every apprentice should serve a probationary period before being indentured, and that the course of workshop training should include the teaching of a schedule of processes to be drawn up by the trade, attendance at technical classes and periodical qualifying examinations during apprenticeship. The hope has been expressed that the question would be taken up by representatives of employers and workpeople in conjunction with the department. A representative of the workpeople suggests that the payment during the first two years of apprenticeship of a small grant, similar to that under the Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme, would help to solve the wages difficulty.Building Trades (London),-Recent reports add to the evidence that the number of apprentices trained in London is very small. In various boroughs It is found that parents desire to apprentice their boys, especially to carpentry and joinery, and many are prepared to pay premiums, but they cannot find firms to take them. Various reasons are given by employers, such as that conditions are unsettled, that rates of pay are too high, and that apprentices occupy bench room required for skilled men. Complaint, is also made of trade union restrictions, but the numbers taken generally appear to be much below what union rules allow. In some cases, however, the skilled men individually seem to object to training apprentices, disliking the trouble and fearing future unemployment. A very strong influence is undoubtedly the fact that firms rely largely for their skilled labour upon men trained in other districts. Local headquarters believe that the smaller London firms in particular do not train apprentices. ,Technical Training (West Midlands).-A. number of employers appear to favour the development of technical training, as an integral part of apprenticeship, and the opinion is also expressed that existing facilities are inadequate. Hitherto, however, the boys as a whole have been hostile, and in some cases the parents are apathetic. Differing views are held in regard to&quot; day-time instruction during working hours. On the one hand, it is considered that the repugnance of the boys is due largely to unwillingness to attend in their own time ; on the other hand, that such training will cause inconvenience in the workshop, and that the boy who is keen to get on attends technical classes on his own initiative and in his own time.Technical Training (London). -An important South London firm of builders have an interesting system of works classes for their boys.  These are held in the evening, twice
Apprentices and Boys-continued.a week, from September to June, and the boys are paid for the time spent at them. Attendance is voluntary, but every influence is exerted to induce the boys to go, and the numbers attending have so far been good. Examinations are held at the end of each session, and prizes are given by the firm. The classes deal with building construction in all its branches. No general education is given, but mathematics and geometry will probably be added soon. Further developments may be made to make the system conform with the requirements of the Education Act, 1918.[Reference to matters of interest to the Training Department will also, be found on pages 294, 295, 296 and 304.]INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION. JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : NEGOTIATIONS.Brewing. At a meeting of brewers and trade union officials on the 16th August at Nottingham, it was unanimously resolved to establish a District Joint Industrial Council for indoor brewery workers, bottlers and maltsters, to cover the same area as the North Midland District Council in the road transport industry.Fishing. Copies of the draft constitution for the proposed Joint Industrial Council in the fishing industry at Grimsby have been circulated to all representatives concerned, and, so far, replies have been received approving the constitution from the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union and the Grimsby Steam Fishing Vessels Engineers and Firemen&apos;s Union.Insurance Committee (Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services). This Council have now been recognised by the Minister, and a liaison officer appointed.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : REPORTS.Industrial.Scottish Bakers. The operatives&apos; section have given notice to move at a meeting on the 26th August, a resolution in favour of the dissolution of the Council.Building: The Resettlement Committee met the Housing Committee of the Cabinet on the 14th August, to consider the Governments proposals as to the supply of labour and output on housing *work. The Resettlement Committee expressed the view that the shortage of labour on housing schemes was largely due to the lack of proper distribution of the available labour, and reiterated their conviction that the most effective way of solving the problem was by an application of the principle of the distribution of contracts already recommended by the Ministry of Health. They were unable to accept the Cabinefs views with regard to the possibilities of augmenting the labour supply, partly on account of the lack of safeguards in the proposals, and partly on account of the inherent dislike of the trade to any scheme of clilution as generally understood, or of payment by results.They called, attention to the scheme for the introduction into the trade of adult apprentices, which had been prepared by the committee and endorsed by the Council. They further pointed out that it was impossible to guarantee that no strikes or stoppages should occur, and expressed an opinion that the union officials were already doing every-thing possible to prevent anything of the kind. They were, however, able to state that, generally speaking, there was no great objection to the working of overtime, and thought that if adequate safeguards could be provided, the Cabinefs proposals in this respect would be accepted.The committee drew particular attention to a practice, to which they took the strongest exception, and which obtains on some contracts for commercial buildings, whereby special inducements are given to attract labour, to the detriment of housing schemes. They thought that under no circumstances should better terms be offered than those provided in the working rules, and that such practices should be immediately punished by the withdrawal of the contracts until the recognised agreements were complied with.
Industrial Councils Division-continued.Mr. Bradshaw, of the Federation of Building Trades Operatives, undertook on behalf of the operatives that the whole position with regard to the augmentation of building labour should be reconsidered, if a net shortage of labour for housing could he proved after measures had been taken for the proper distribution of the available building labour. He admitted that of 57,000 bricklayers in the country, not more than 7,000 were engaged on housing work, but insisted that it was the duty of the Government to see that labour was properly distributed between housing and commercial work, which should be done by the prohibition of luxury building and by the distribution of contracts. On behalf of the Government, it was urged that the distribution of contracts scheme had already been given a fair trial, but did not always result in reasonable prices, in which event it was necessary to resort to competition.The Cabinet Committee undertook to give further consideration to the position as disclosed by the conference, and to furnish a considered reply within a few days, after which a further conference is expected.Electrical Gable Making. At a meeting on the 18th August, the trade union delegates announced the result of the recent ballot on; the employers&apos; offer of 5s. to men and 2s. to women, in reply to the demand of 15s., all&apos;round, to employees over 18 years of age. The ballot showed a 12 per cent, majority in favour of a strike, but did not represent a substantial number of voters. The employers declined to improve on their offer, which was ultimately accepted by the operatives&apos; side on behalf of their executive.Electricity Supply. The District Council for Yorkshire, North Derbyshire, North Nottinghamshire and North Lincolnshire met on the 11th August. The grading of certain company undertakings was referred back to the Basic Rates Committee.Glass. The Departmental Committee appointed by the Home Secretary to inquire into the advisability of the two shift proposal for women and young persons, have invited the Council to give evidence on the 27th August. The special sub-committee appointed by the Council to consider the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill, will meet on the 24th August, to decide if evidence shall be given.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  The District Council for the East Midland area, on the 12th August, adopted the report of the Executive Committee on grading, the normal week, overtime rates, and minimum rates of wages.The District Council for Northumberland and Durham on the 13th August adopted the National CounciPs resolutions on the 47-hour week, overtime rates and holidays.Printing. The Employers&apos; Labour Committee met the executive of the Typographical Association on the 19th August to discuss the re-grading of Manchester and Liverpool, as the association were claiming that the pay attached to Grade 1 towns should be in-creased by 10s. a week. No decision was reached, and the meeting was adjourned until the 24th August. The employers claimed that the association had made no case for improving the status&quot;&apos;of Manchester and Liverpool, though they admitted that a case might have been made for a general improvement of wages throughout the country, as the last increase of 10s. was given when the cost-of-living index, which is now 255, stood at 225. The employers reported that the index was expected to advance considerably on the 1st September, and offered a conference to discuss increases in wages on the 20th September, immediately after the publication of the Labour Gazette.  This offer was refused.The employers meet the National Union of Bookbinders and Machine Rulers on the 25th August.   The union are claiming improved grading for 60 towns.The Newspaper Society have applied for representation on the Council. It is under-stood that no objection will be raised by the employers&apos; or by the workers&apos; side, provided that the whole of the newspaper industry outside London is covered by the Council.Vehicle Building. The secretary of the National Employers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders has communicated the following resolution which was adopted at the annual conference of the Association : &quot; That this conference, whilst endorsing the action of the executive committee in withdrawing from the Joint Industrial Council owing to inadequate representation, now instructs the executive committee to apply for the re-formation of the Joint Industrial Council with adequate representation.&quot;The National Federation of Vehicle Trades have not yet concluded negotiations with regard to the proposed affiliation with the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations. A conference of the employers&apos; associations will probably be called to discuss the points at issue.
Industrial Councils Division-continued.Waterworks Undertakings. The District Council for the Eastern Counties met on the 19th August. The report of the Grading Committee was considered. The employers proposed, for undertakings in areas of 10,000 census population and over, a minimum wage of 63s. per week, and for those in areas below 10,000, a minimum, of 55s. per week. The employees proposed, in areas of 20,000 population and over, a minimum of 75s. per week, and in areas below 20,000, 65s. per week. No agreement was reached, and it was decided to submit the two proposals to the determination of the Council.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: WORKS COMMITTEES.Brewing. Inquiries in the Northumberland and Sunderland district were continued. The formation of works committees is being considered by Messrs. John Russell &amp; Son, Ltd., and Messrs. Isaac Tucker &amp; Co., Ltd., Gateshead-on-Tyne.flour milling. The Crown Mills and the Riverside Flour Mills controlled by Messrs. J. Ure &amp; Sons, and employing over 200 workers, were visited. The management have decided to form joint works committees if the District Council adopt the scheme recom-mended by the Joint Industrial Council. The adoption of a constitution in accordance with the recommendations ot the Surrey and Sussex District Council is being considered by the existing committees at the mills controlled by Messrs. Bowyer &amp; Son, Guildiord, Messrs. J. &amp; T. H. Wallis, Ltd., Beddington, Messrs. D. Napper, Ltd., Sutton, Messrs. R. Simmonds &amp; Sons, Aldershot, and Messrs. C. A. Botting, Guildford.The joint works committees at the works of Ho vis, Ltd., in London and Manchester, which were established in 1914, have been investigated. The management consider them essential for the preservation of harmonious relations, and many disputes have been settled, employers and workpeople being equally bound by their decisions. Sports clubs and a benevolent fund have been established. Their constitution differs slightly from that recommended by the Council, the adoption of which is to be considered.Pottery. Messrs. Cartwright &amp; Edwards have decided to establish joint works committees at their four works, and have invited the Ministry to assist. The Malkin Tile Works Co., Ltd., Burslem, have also decided to form a works committee. A meeting of the workpeople of the British Anchor Pottery Co., Ltd., was addressed and a provisional committee was elected to draft a constitution. Assistance will be given at the meetings of the provisional committees elected to draft constitutions at the works of Messrs. J. H. Cope &amp; Co., Longton, and Messrs. Hewitt Bros., Longton.TRADE BOARDS DIVISION.PROCEEDINGS OF TRADE BOARDS.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board resolved to give Notice of Proposal, as follows: To vary the general minimum time-rate for unskilled male workers from Is. 2d. to Is. Z\d. per hour, with consequent increases for juvenile workers ; and the general minimum time-rate for skilled male workers from Is. 5%d. to Is. Id. per hour. To fix a piece-work basis time-rate for male workers of Is. %\d. per hour, and to vary the basis of calculation of such rates for male apprentices accordingly. To vary the general minimum time-rate and piece-work basis time-rate for&apos; female workers, other than drawing hands, from %\d. and Q^d. to 9^. and 10c?. per hour respectively, with consequent increases for juvenile female workers and female learners.Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain). The Administrative Committee considered the early closing of boot and shoe repairing shops, and the situation arising from the Governments Bill dealing with early closing. They agreed to urge upon the Government the importance of this subject to the trade, and the desirability of introducing a clause into the Bill bringing boot and shoe repairing businesses within its provisions.The committee considered an offer from Mr. J. H. Boraston to meet the Board, on behalf of Earl Haig, to discuss the employment of ex-Service men in the trade, and agreed to invite Mr. Boraston to attend the next meeting of the Board. The committee con-sidered the question of disabled ex-soldiers who have been employed under the National Training Scheme at less than the minimum rates fixed by the Board.  In view of the legal
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 222.Trade Boards Division--continued.difficulty of cancelling minimum rates in respect of these workers, it was agreed to grant permits of exemption in all such cases.Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board (Great Britain).-After consideration of the objections lodged against the Board&apos;s proposal dated the 4th June, it was resolved to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers, and piece-work basis time-rates for female workers, on the basis of the proposals, except that an intermediate scale for female workers from 15 to 16 years of age was added. The Minister has been asked to make the rates effective as from the 11th September. It was further resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum time-rates to be fixed in respect of certain classes of male and female workers, agreement having been reached as to the definition, of these classes.A Standing Committee was appointed to consider applications for permits of exemption. It was resolved that such applications should be dealt with by the committee, and should not be delegated to Local Employment Committees unless occasion arose.Paper Box Trade Board (Great Britain). The Scottish District Trade Committee considered the proposals to vary general minimum time-rates for a certain class of male workers and to fix overtime rates for male and female workers, and also to vary and fix minimum rates of wages for female workers, set out in the Notices of Proposal dated the 29th May and the 4th August. &apos; The committee agreed to recommend the Board to vary and fix rates as set out in the former notice. Separate recommendations were made by representatives of workers and employers with regard to the second Proposal. The Birmingham District Trade Committee reached the same conclusions. The Bristol District Trade Committee agreed to recommend the Board to vary and fix minimum rates in accordance with both Proposals.The Birmingham Committee also considered a resolution recommending the Board to adopt the principle that all piece-rates should be 25 per cent, higher than the time-rates. They agreed to submit separate recommendations to representatives of workers and employers. The Bristol Committee considered the same resolution with a similar result.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light Clothing Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 16th August, to fix general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates, and overtime rates for male and female workers.The general minimum time-rates proposed are, for female workers in the factory branch, 8d. per hour, with lower rates for female learners.

WAGES AND ARBITRATION DEPARTMENT.AWARDS.The number of awards issued during the week was five, of which three were under the Industrial Courts Act.Engineering and Foundry Trades. Advances were granted of Is., and in some cases 2s., on the basic rates in certain districts.   (Award No. 450.)Clerks: Iron and Steel Trades (Wales). An ad hoc Board fixed minimum rates on graduated scales : juniors, 16 to 21 years of age, 35s. to 85s. per week, according to age ; general clerks,  4 10s. to  8 15s. per week, according to service; chief clerks,  8 to  10 12s. 6d.; female clerks&apos; to be paid on the same scale abated by one-fifth.AGREEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS.Building Trades Operatives (Beverley). The building trade operatives * engaged on the extension of Messrs. Hodgson&apos;s tannery at Beverley have resumed work. On the 23rd July the National Conciliation Board decided that the union officials should issue instructions to return to work, as the union&apos;s action was unconstitutional. The terms of settlement, so far as they relate to the non-union men engaged on maintenance work, are not yet known.Sand-pit Workers (Doncaster). About 40 men. and youths employed in the sand and gravel pits at Doncaster, struck on the 7th August in support of their demand for the building trade rate of 2s. Id. per hour. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Sheffield, arranged a conference at which it was agreed to pay a flat rate of Is. 9d. per hour for labourers, and a scale according to age for youths.  Work was resumed on the 16th August.Sand Quarry Men (Mansfield). Men employed at the Mansfield sand quarries threat-ened to strike in support of a demand for the building trade rate, an increase of 5d. per hour. The Chief Conciliation Officer arranged negotiations as a result of which the men received an increase of 2\d. per hour, and the strike was averted.Garment Workers (Newcastle-on-Tyne). The strikef of workpeople employed by Messrs. Fenwick, Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne, is regarded as ended, the firm having decided that the employees in question have left their service. This decision appears to be due partly to the slackness in the trade.Railway Running Shed Men and Shopmen (Great Western Railway). On the 11th August the chief mechanical engineer of the Great Western Railway saw Mr. H. J. Wilson in connection with the strike of fitters. He stated that a two days&apos; conference has been held with representatives of the shed and shop men from the affected districts. It was found impossible to bring the South Wales men into line with the other representatives. On the ground that the differential between the running shed men and the shopmen was too small, it was agreed, except by the South Wales representatives, to institute a differen-tial of 8s. per week. A memorandum to that effect, signed by both parties, was presented by the chief mechanical engineer for submission to the Industrial Court, as a mutual arrangement which presumably would supersede Award No. 373. On tnis assumption, the men&apos;s representatives had undertaken to do their best to obtain an immediate resumption,&apos; and a number&apos;of men had started work that morning.Mr. Wilson pointed out that, so far as the Ministry was concerned, the proposed* See this Report, No. 21, 19th June, p. 744.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 5, 31st July, p. 193.Trade Boards Division-continued.ESTABLISHMENT AND AMENDMENT  OF TRADE BOARDS.Netv Boards.-Regulations have been made governing the constitution and proceedings of the Toy Trade Board (Great Britain).The Milk Distributive Trade Board -(Scotland) has been established. &apos;

As neither side doubted its meaning, the Award would have to stand. The Act governing the Courfs procedure made it clear that it could operate only when a difference existed; it certainly would not confirm an agreement, especially one contravening an Award issued only a month before. The Ministry could not be a party to making the awards of the Court null and void because the workmen concerned struck to enforce a more generous recognition of their claims. The chief mechanical engineer was advised to arrange for the matter to be submitted to the General Managers&apos; Committee of the railway companies.On the 12th August it was announced in the Press that an offer had been made of an advance of 7s. Id. per week to some grades, and 9s. Id. per week to others, and that the men would accept the offer. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Cardiff, reports that an offer was made of 55s., plus 33s. 6d., plus 12J per cent, per week of 47 hours, to all Great Western Railway mechanics in the provinces. This involves a variable advance, in most cases of 6s. 9d. per week. The men in the eastern districts of Wales and in Mon-mouthshire agreed to this, and resumed work on the 14th August. The men in West Wales decided later to accept the offer, and there was a full resumption on the 16th August. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham, reports that the advance in his area is 6s. per week. This places the mechanics in a far better position than those on other railways, and an attempt to raise the other rates is expected.COMMITTEES, CONFERENCES AND DEPUTATIONS.Fair Wages Resolution. A deputation of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress have on several occasions put before the Minister proposals for an amend-ment of the administration of the Fair Wages Resolution. After consideration of their proposals, the secretary of the Parliamentary Committee was informed on the 6th August that every effort has been made to ensure as early a publication as possible in the Labour Gazette of the names of firms who receive Government contracts, but that contracts not exceeding  500 are in general omitted. The contracting departments moreover had agreed to supply annually to the Parliamentary Committee, if so requested, a list of firms on their contractors&apos; lists, and further, that in cases of alleged non-compliance with the Resolution, they would bring together, when necessary, representatives of the trade unions and of the contractor to ascertain the facts. Arrangements had also been made that, wherever it is necessary for a contracting department to know the names of sub-contractors, the names should be published in the Labour Gazette, subject to the limitations existing in the case of the principal contractor. Further, in trades where such is the practice, the contractor would be required to exhibit, or have available for inspection, a copy of any signed agree-ment determining rates of wages and hours of labour commonly recognised by employers and trade societies in the district. The contracting departments were taking action to put these amendments into operation.The secretary was also informed that it had been, decided to propose in Parliament, as soon as possible, an amendment to the Fair Wages Resolution, providing that a firm shall not be regarded as a &quot; fair &quot; firm unless they observe the principle of the Resolution on civil as well as Government work.QUESTIONS PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.Railway Shopmen (Cardiff). The Chief Conciliation Officer, Cardiff, reported that 70 shopmen employed by the Cardiff Railway struck on the 14th August to enforce their demand for  5 per week, the immediate cause being, no doubt, the settlement reached in the Great Western Railway dispute. The intervention of the department was requested. It was pointed out that the company should take the matter up with the General Managers&apos; Committee of the railway companies, and that the Ministry were not a party to the settle-ment of the dispute on. the Great Western Railway.White Marl Workers (Potteries). No material development in this dispute has taken place.* The employers may be approached individually by the union, and some non-associated firms may concede the men&apos;s demands. The chairman of the Marl Owners&apos; Association will convene the Joint Defence Board in September as promised, provided no change in the position has occurred meanwhile.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 229.
Wages and Arbitration Department-continued.Boot Last Workers (Midlands).-At a further meeting* it was suggested that if the union agreed to the workmen on strike at the British American Last Works being considered as dismissed, and the firm as having the right to replace them, the general lock-out should be called off. No agreement was reached. The employers probably will not re-open their works until trade improves. The union have complained of the employers&apos; precipitate action, hut, while the employers admit the fact, they adhere to their decision. The union have, however, little cause for complaint, as they have avowed their intention of remaining out until their claim is conceded.Warehousemen (Liverpool). No settlement having been arrived at in the negotiations J as to the payment of dockyard rates to the warehousemen employed by Messrs. Ridgway, Ltd., all the men ceased work on the 17th August.Sawmilling Industry (East Anglia). As a result of a conference^ under the chairman-ship of the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, the employers have offered a rate of Is. 9d. for sawyers and Is. 6d. for labourers, which it is expected will be accepted.[Reference, to matters of interest in connection with Wages and Arbitration will be found also on pages 288 to 292, and 302 to 305.]APPENDIX.QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Unemployment.Major Mackenzie Wood asked the Minister of Labour in what ways precisely the Government is doing everything that it can to prevent and minimise unemployment.Sir Montague Barlow: The chief measure proposed by the Government at the present moment for the mitigation of unemployment is the new Unemployment Insurance Bill, whereby it is anticipated that not less than 12,000,000 workers will be insured against unemployment. I should, however, add that the whole question of unemployment is at present engaging the careful attention of the Government, and, as has already been stated by the Prime Minister, a Committee of the Cabinet has been appointed to consider the matter.Major M. Wood: Was the Unemployment Insurance Bill initiated to stop unemplby-ment or simply to mitigate the evils arising out of it ?Mr. Billing: Are the Government making preparation to give unemployment pay to 12,000,000 workers 1  Is that their only idea of solving the unemployment problem ?Sir M. Barlow: I doubt whether there is any one panacea for solving the unemploy-ment difficulty, but the Bill will probably go a long way towards meeting the difficulty. As has been stated, the Prime Minister has appointed a Committee of the Cabinet to deal with the question. (\%th August.)Ex-Service Men: King&apos;s Roll (Government Contracts).Mr. Grundy asked the Prime Minister if he is in a position to state when he will recommend that no further Government contracts shall be given to employers or firms who have not signed the King&apos;s Roll to take on the percentage of disabled ex-Service men.Dr. Macnamara: I have been asked to reply to this question. This matter is engaging my closest attention. It was announced on the 14th June that Government departments in placing contracts would give preference to firms on the King&apos;s Roll. I have already taken steps to have the matter re-examined in the light of the recommenda-tion of the Select Committee on Pensions &quot; that Government contracts be limited, after a date to be fixed, to firms whose names are on the National Roll and who are employing the percentage of disabled men fixed for their particular trade.&quot; I hope to be able to make an announcement on the subject at an early date.-(16th August.)* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 227. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 4, 24th July, p. 162. % See this Report, Vol. II, No. 7, 14th August, p. 258.  $ See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 228.
