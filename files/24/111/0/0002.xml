(THIS DOCUiaiJT IS TH3 PROPERTY Of HIS BRXTAIWIG MAJESTYGOVERNCONFIDENTIAL. CABINET.C.P.-1802. RUSSIA &amp; POLAND.STATEMENT TO THE PRESS (A3 AGREED lOFiOTfTO BBT(CTTte. LLOYD GEORGEiroTrimoirw^  &quot; - &apos;^WME)   -(Circulated for Record)Jn their conversation today and yesterday, Signor GiolHtl and ivir* Lloyd George discussed the general political situation and more particularly the bearing thereon of recent events in Eastern Europe.This exchange of views has established that complete agree-ment exists between the British and Italian Governments as to the vital and paramount need for the re-establishment of peace throughout the world at the earliest possible moment.The first guarantee of such a peace is to be found in the various Treaties of Peace which have already been signed^ and the way in which these Treaties are carried out.   The victors in the war should display a spirit of moderation In their en* forcement and the vanquished a spirit of loyalty in their ex-ecutIon*   With that object in view the two Governments trust that the good understanding reached at Spa as to the methods of executing the Treaty of Versailles, will be further devel-oped so as to cover all outstanding questions, and that the hopeful experiment then conducted will be justified by the faithful carrying out by all parties of the agreement there arrived at.Before peace 18 fully established, however, there remain a number of important questions to be decided! the majority -of which are Indiasolubly connected with the march of events in the territories of the former Russian Empire.Until peace is established between Russia and the rest of the world an atmosphere of disturbance and unsettlement will continue to menace the worlds    For that reason, the British and Italian Governments have been taking steps, in the face of much misrepresentation, to restore communication between Russia and the world outslde*    It is, therefore, with profound regret that they have just heard that the Soviet Government have, in spite of the repeated assurance to the contrary given officially on their behalf by.their representative In London, sought to impose on Poland conditions incompatible with national independence *The Government of Poland is based on the oho ice of the whole adult male population of the country, without distfoo&amp;ton of class, and this so-called civic army to. be drawn from one class only, which is referred to in the fourth condition of the Soviet terms, ia only and^indirect method of organising a force to overthrow by violence this democratic constitution and substituting for it the despotism of a privileged few who may have absorbed the doctrinoa of Bolshevism,,    We cannot help apprehending that, when the detailed conditions of the composition and direction of this force,, kept back as they are now until Poland demobilised her army, are&apos;revealed later on, they will be found to be moulded on the plan of the Russian Revd Army*For one nation to insist as a condition of peace with another that the force organised for protection of life, property and good order in the latter country shall be drawn only from one olass of its citizens to the exclusion of all others, is an unwarranted infringement of the liberty and independence and self-respect of that country.    To have added such a condition after M. Kamenefffs pledges to the British Government that nothing which was not of a secondary nature was omitted from his summary of the terms, is a gross breach of faith, and negotiations of any
kind with a Government which so lightly treats Its word becomes difficult if not impossible.The Soviet Government rejected a suggestion made by the british Government for the making of a truce under conditions which would have guaranteed Russian territory against any acts of a rrrrr ess ion and continued its career of invasion of ethno-graphical Poland with a view to conquering that country by force of arms for Soviet institutions.If the Soviet Government, notwithstanding the punishment which its aggression is encountering, sttll refuses to-with&quot; draw this sinister proposal, but continues the war inside Pol-ish territory in order to force its acceptance on the Polish people, no free government can either acknowledge or deal with the Soviet oligarchy-    What has befallen in this short war to invaders of national rights, whether In Russia or in Poland, ought to teach wisdom to aggressors.   The world East and v&apos;!est is crying for peace, but it is only attainable on the basis of a full recognition of the liberties of nations.The British and Italian Governments are alarmed at the in-definite prolongation of the present state of conflict amongst nations *    To the peoples engaged those antagonisms can bring nothing but ever Increasing misery.    To the peoples of the world at large they involve continued ,unrest.Until these conflicts cease the development of agriculture and industry, and the interchange of commodities of different lands and climates, on which the economic life of nations de-pends, cannot come into full operation. Scarcity and high prices, with their attendant privations and perils, are the Inevitable result. Civilisation It3elf, shaken and weakened by five years of incessant warfare, is menaced by the prospect.The British and Italian Governments are, therefore, united In urging that every effort should be made to bring to a conclusion existing conditions of strife between nations.August 25rd, 1920.
