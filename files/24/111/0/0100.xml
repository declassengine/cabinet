I undertook to submit to the Cabinet,the evidence which had led me to this conclusion^When the representatives of the Russian Soviet Government. had been in London a little over a month, it became certain that the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Society had received money from Nogin, and a telegram which was received by %g&amp;mXn Irom Rothstein as late as September 9th ($0.9). advised energetic I        agitation amongst the masses through this Society, and in addition a subsidy of  500 for the use of its committees, j Further, there is definite evidence that Krassin on instructions from Moscow, made use of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; for the purpose of propaganda.   Both he and Klishko were present I        at the luncheon party given by Francis Meynell and George *        Lansbury on June 9th, at which a subsidy for the &quot;Herald&quot; I       was arranged;   and it is clear that both took a large partin the subsequent negotiations with Mr. Francis Meynell.   At i       the beginning of July members of the Delegation cabled tolitvinoff/
Litvinoff about tho fulfilment of hie promises to Meynell.It was then arranged that Krasgin should bring the promisedsubsidies with him.       i&apos;rora a deoyphered cable it was learned that the Delegation had disposed of  40s000 whioh they had handed over to the &apos;,7D\uUy Herald&quot; and that they expected torealise another  50.,000, out of which a further  10,000 wasto be paid to the &quot;HeT&amp;ld&quot;.Evidence of Irakis&quot; s ^ad faith is not confined to hisrelations with tho &quot;&apos;.C5 E^rsld&quot;,   Kamenoff definitelystated in one inst-rao^? fch?/;: the suggestion ha was submitting to Lenin and T.rot?:::y jnrs tbe vc::! of Kraosin and himself and in another telegram whioh referred to the famous Polishflote he said &quot;We hope to discuss personally the historicsignificance of the step ta&amp;en by us&quot;.Nearly all Litvinoff13 telegrams were addressed to the delegation as a whole, which tends to prove that the subsidy to the &quot;Herald&quot; must have been common knowledge to all members ol the Soviet Mission.Telegram Bo, 10 - as recent as September 10th - is perhaps the most conclusive of all.The following are the telegrams affecting grassinupon which 1 principally rely.I,From Tchitcherin &quot;The most convenient method of moscow.To Krassin, London. transmitting information destined forDate 17th June 1920.the English press, e.g. British atrocities in Eaturn, is through you, in view of your presence in London, where you undoubtedly meet a lot of people.

In order to give a full list of the conflicts created by England you should point out in your utterances all the seriousness of the Japanese question and its influence on our relations with England.    Let journa-lists develop this theme.&quot;&quot;I emphasise once more the fact that the recognition of the claims of private persons in England is only accorded in principle;   the application of this principle is left entirely to the future formal peace negotiations. Nevertheless, we must exploit thiscolossal concession as extensively as possible for purposes of agitation.&quot;&quot;Let it appear in the press th$&amp; Britain has annexed the Crimea making use of ftrangel for this purpose. Use this for purposes of agitation among&apos; labour or-ganlsations;   you can do this becauseyou

Make wide use of this for bringing pressure to bear on the British,    It is idle to talk about us paying debts to the British when England is supporting the Japanese occupation 9t Siberia,   Develop this subject in your conversation with the Government and with Labour organizations&quot;,&quot;I advise you to make use of the question put by the Council of Action concerning the freedom of the Polish nation to determine its own fate by making a detailed written statement of the most popular character explaining the meaning of freedom from the landowners and capital-iste.   Compare the attitude in the iis-tricts through which the Hed Army has passed with that of the rest of Poland, Lot this letter be signed by some British Communist;   for your own part add merely that you reoognise entirely the freedom of the iolish nation to determine its ownfate
fate and ask for a reply as to which of the members of the Council of action share in the opinions of the British Communist and which of the members reject them.   This Communist must not oall himself a communist in the letter,   lerhaps Williams would be&apos; this Communist?

This is unavoidable, having regard to. the present composition of the Council, and, therefore,  I should consider
oonalder necessary the energetic continua-tion of the agitqtion amongst the masses themselves thr)U^i the committees of &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; and the ruthless exposure of the traitorous tenor.nc.ies of the Council through the communist party.

It is evident that the British G-overnment. wishes to conceal the real nature of the step taken against   us.   We are- doing everything to unmask this illegal atte-.pt.
