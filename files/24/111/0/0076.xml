(20), Honclusion 3.)(Previaic papers - CP. 1843, 1844 I 18?1).Sent 11.45 p,m. September, 18, 1920.SECRFT     PERSONALCabinet have been considering situation caused by heavy, strain on our military resources arising from the large number of troops required for Mesopotamia   coming on top of exceptional post-war liabilities in several other quarters.At present we are depending too largely on India in this matter.   In addition to large number of Indian troops already in Mesopotamia Government of India are sow seeding 2o more battalions, 3 British and 17 Indian to that country. They are doing this with great reluctance and not without running some risk.   Indian opinion is increasingly opposed to employment of large number of Indian forces for a prolonged period in distant expeditions and the Indian troops in Mesopotamia are reported to be suffering from a sense of 1 injustice on amount of their long detention overseas.Maintenance of a larger proportion of white troops in Mesopotamia is considered of great importance for political as well as military reasor.3 but our many commitments in other parts of the world kave far the time beins asxhauoted our available resources in British troops and though recruitment continues good there is no possibility under the present voluntary.system of raising in the United Kingdom a sufficient number of men to make the white element, either in Mesopotamia
or India, aq strong as is desirable.&apos;  Under these circumstances General staff have raised the question whether Canada, Australia and ?jew Zealand might not be willing to afford some measure of military assistance during preoent period of strain. Such assistance might take either direct form of sending troops to Mesopotamia or indirect form of relieving British troop3 in maia or Palestine so as to free latter for service in Mesopotamia.It is realised that Dominion Governments may not be in a position to spare troops from their permanent forces for purposes indicated but thought that they might be able to raise such troops on voluntary basis from personnel with previous war experience possibly providing nucleus of staff and higher ranks from permanent forces.It is thought that service in Palestine might be the most attractive to men from the Dominions and the substitution of*Dominion troops for the British troops at present in that country would be of substantial assistance.You will understana that it is not suggested that the Dominions should bear the cost of these troops, unless indeed they should of their own accord desire to do sc.   We are prepared to pay the whole cost ourselves although the burden of the extra expenditure which is the aftermath of the war is weighing heavily upon the United Kingdom.The Cabinet is in no way committed to approving thisproposal of the General staff, indeed there is some difference of opinion about it.   meanwhile X should be grateful if you would in strict confidence sound your Ministers as to the reception which such a proposal if made would be likely tomeet with in Canada^gew 30aland.Austral i a. lOMER.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. 23rd September, 192q.
