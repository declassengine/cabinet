Circulated by the Secretary of State for India,-^SECRET.3MESOPOTAMIA.My colleagues may be interested to read this letter which I have received from Professor A. T. Clay, an American Archaeologist, who spent some months in Mesopotamia before the recent political troubles wrecked a good deal of the sound administrative work that had been done. His appreciation is not the less valuable because, unlike most of what is appearing in the Press, it is disinterested and first-hand.Having through your courtesy been granted the privilege of visiting Baghdad during the past winter to ascertain for the Archaaological Institute of America whether it is advisable to establish at this time a School for Oriental Research in that city, as the centre for the Mesopotamian field, similar to the one we have in Athens and Jerusalem, I feel constrained on my return to London (being en route for America) to express my gratitude for the hospitality which I have enjoyed while in that region ; and also to express my appreciation of the magnificent work the brilliant and inde-fatigable Chief Administrator and his band of intelligent and efficient young men were doing. I was astonished at all they had accomplished for the country. As one acquainted with the history of archasological researches in Babylonia I expected to find in these regions, as depicted by the explorers and travellers of the past, the same insecurity of life and property as hereto-fore existed. I found, however, in fact, a security in the parts I visited, from Mosul to the Gulf (often accompanied by a single British officer), such, as it then appeared to me, as one enjoys in. New York or London. It seemed almost incredible that such a change could have taken place in the compara-tiyely short time the British have occupied the land. I was so pleased with these results that on my return to Jerusalem I immediately communicated with my Committee and advised that steps be taken to proceed in the matter of establishing the school in Baghdad.I was no less astonished at the results already achieved by the Irrigation.&apos; Public Works, Educational, and other Departments. But the feature of the administrative . work which above all secures grateful recognition was the justice that was being dealt by British officials in legal matters. While at Samarra I had an interesting experience which illustrates this. I was talking with Major Berry, the political officer of the district, in his administrative quarters, when suddenly several Arabs appeared before him, one of whom informed him that he was the man charged with murder for whom search was being made. He had been hiding in Iiillah, but everyone told him that if he returned, he could expect full justice ; and as he was not guilty of the crime he had returned to stand his trial. I took the opportunity of inquiring from one of the chiefs who accompanied him with reference to legal matters, and was told that the natives appreciated fully that they received justice in the decisions that the British officials rendered.As an American I am pleased thus to give expression to these impressions with which I came away from Iraq. I regret exceedingly to learn now, only a few months later, of the very serious situation that has arisen for the men in the field. I find here also that very difficult questions have been raised. The evening papers state that Sir Percy Cox, who is about to start for Mesopotamia, may set up a Council of State and a General Elective Assembly at Baghdad. May I add that I wish such a move were contemplated by the Foreign Office for the unhappy inhabitants of Palestine.Trusting that all these difficulties and problems will find an early solution.E. S. M.30th August 1920.Dear Sir,c/o Brown Shipley, 123, Pall Mall, W. 1, 25th August 1920.I am, &amp;cA. T.&quot;Clay.The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu,Secretary of State for India. 10  2192     100  9.20
