LEAGUE   OF   RATIONS.Sunderlancl House, Cur?or Street, LOOGOli&apos;,  W.1, Srd September, 1920.P3RMAME?T CQ\m OF IKTIOflAL JUSTICE.The Counoil of the League of Nations has the honour to communicate to the Government the sohemepresented by the International Committee of eminent Jurists who were invited to submit plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice, and who have recently concluded their deliberations at r ha Hague.The Council do not&apos;propose to express any opinion on the merits of the scheme until they ha.ve had a full oppor-tunity of considering it; but they permit themselves to accompany the documents with the following observations.The Schema has been arrived at alter prolong u cussion by a most competent tribunal:   its membec3 represented widely different national points of view.   They all signed the Report,   Its fate has therefore been very LiLfevc-nt from that of the plans for a Court of Arbitral Justics, which were discussed without result in 1907.   DoabMo^s the agreement was not arrived at without difficulty.   Variety of opinions, even among: the most competent ezperts, is in-inevitable on a subject so perplexing and complicated.   Seme   -mutual concessions are therefore necessary if the failure of thirteen years ago is not to bo repoated.   The Council would regard an irreconcilable difference of opinion on the merits of the scheme as an - international misfortune of the gravest kind.   It would mean that the Loague was publicly compelled to admit its incapacity to carry out one of the most important of the tasks which it was invited to perform. The failure would be great and probably irreparable; for, if agreement proves impossible under circumstances apparently so favourable, it is hard to see how and when the task of securing it will be successfully resumed.
It is in tho spirit indicated by these observations that the Counoil on their part propose to examine the project submitted to them by the Committee of Jurists; and they trust that xn the same spirit the Members of the League will deal with this all-important subject when the Council brings the recommendations before the Assembly.Signed on behalf of the Council of the League of Nations,AIMILOTTI.Acting-Secretary-General.
