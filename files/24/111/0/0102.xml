T3TC**  ttiftThJ* Doci-mant h the Property ofTRADE WITH SOVIET RUSSIAAdmiralty Memorandum for the CabinetI understand that the Russian Trade 0ormitteflunder Mr. S.*Fa Wise, C*B., has been instructed to proceed with the drafting of a Trade Agreement with the Soviet Government-, and that&apos;this is tc be discussed first with the. Supreme Economic Council, and subsequently tith the Russian Trade Delegation in this country,I must record my opinion that the Committee&apos;s proposals are, in present circumstances, premature:   and I earnestly hope that no active steps towards the resumption of trade will be talren while we are neither at peace nor war with Soviet Russia.Until normal diplomatic relations are resumed, there can be no security for our traders, nor surety for our receiving: an adequate equivalent for the goods we supply.On -the other hand there is grave danger that the goods Russia receives from Britain will simply be used to re-equip the Red Army, for the purpose of attaching cur friends and Allies in Europe and embarrassing our Empire in the Sast.(Intd.)   w\ H.&apos;27.9.20o
