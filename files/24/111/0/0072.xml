AThis Do?.&apos;,;rnent 13 trie Property of 1 871     V)\ His Unvmnlz Majes&apos;:y&apos;s Government.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET. 3I circulated to the Cabinet the telegram of the Government of India 011 the subject of the employment of the Indian Army in the East (CP. 1844). I now circulate some extracts from the. newspapers which have come to my notice. These are only the left wing, and can he properly valued having regard to their source. But I fear that the position is bad, because they can be taken to be the first mutterings of a storm, and because our position is perhaps assailable, and is certain to be fastened on with eagerness by a much wider class than these extremists.  ,E. S. M.16th September 1920.Extract from the Democrat (United Provinces), dated 27th June 1920.* &amp; *But the interest of India is infinitely greater than that of Asia. It is important that she realises that she is the main cause of the situation in the East. England is subjugating the buffer States that lie between Europe and India only in order to perpetuate her possession of India, the brightest jewel in the British Crown. It is to tighten her fetters that the Near East was conquered and the Turkish Empire broken up. But unfortunately this is not the whole of the story ; England has not conquered the Near East only because of India, but also through India. It is Indian blood and Indian treasure that have in the main conquered our innocent and helpless neighbours ; and it is even these that are keeping these victims down and throttling their efforts at freedom. India cannot disclaim her responsibility, and well may one exclaim, &quot; 0 India, thou hast become the veritable bane of the East.&quot;We can, if we like, emulate the British Labour Party, whicli has compelled the British Government to withdraw their forces from Russia, and compel our bureaucratic masters to withdraw Indian forces from the East.Extracts from Swadesamitram (Madras), dated 28th June and 1st July 1920.28th June 1920.ivActive arrangements are being made to administer Mesopotamia. The Arabs seem to be creating disturbances often, as they dislike the stationing of Indian troops there, lt is not known why these troops, trained with Indian money, should be stationed in Mesopotamia and other places.1st July 1920.* * * $We do not see why Indian troops trained at India&apos;s expense should be stationed in foreign countries. During the war lakhs of Indian troops were stationed in France, East Africa, Mesopotamia, and some other places. We do not grudge to help with Indian forces during such emergencies. If Indian troops are not sent back even after the war has terminated and. peace concluded and conquered territories have been appropriated, we cannot but condemn it. It is complained that Indian troops and the Arabs often fall out in Mesopotamia. Why this unnecessary hitch ? What is the reason for sending away Indian troops to foreign countries and having British troops here? The Government do not confide in. Indian troops and Indian leaders. What is the need for disbanding the Bengali regiment ? What rewards have we got for the services rendered by the Indian troops ?Extract from Young India (Bombay), dated 30th June 1920.Mr. M. K. Gandhi writes : &quot; Slowly but surely the Musalmans are, preparing for the battle before.them. They have to light against odds that are undoubtedly heavy, but not half as heavy as the Prophet had against him. Plow often did he not put his life in danger ? But his faith in God was unquenchable. He went forward with a light heart, for God was on his side for he represented truth.   If his followers2281    100 9.20 A
have half the prophet&apos;s faith and-half his spirit of sacrifice, the odds will be presently even, and will in a little while turn against the despoilers of Turkey. Already the rapacity of the Allies is telling against themselves. France finds her task difficult. Greece cannot stomach herillgotten gains. And England finds Mesopotamia a tough job. The oil of Mosul may feed the lire she has so wantonly lighted and burn her fingers badly. The newspapers say the Arabs do not like the presence of the Indian soldiery in their midst. I do not wonder. They are a fierce and a brave people, and do not understand why Indian soldiers should find themselves in Mesopotamia. Whatever the fate of non-co-operation, I wish that not a single Indian will offer his services for Mesopotamia, whether for the civil or the military department. We must learn to think for ourselves, and before entering upon any employment, find out whether thereby, we may not make ourselves instruments of injustice. Apart from the question of the Khilafat and from the point of abstract justice, the English have no right to hold Mesopotamia, it is no part of our loyalty to help the Imperial Government in what is in plain language daylight robbery. If, therefore, we seek civil or military employment in Mesopotamia we do so for the sake of earning a livelihood.   It is our duty to see that the source is not tainted.&quot;Extract from the Bombay Chronicle, dated 1st July 1920.The position in and around Persia is undoubtedly grave. The story concerning the evacuation of Resht by the British and the setting up of a Provincial Government there on 5th June, with^Mirza Kutckuk as the leader, is given out by a wireless message from Moscow, published in the Manchester Guardian. It is announced that the British troops are withdrawing to Baghdad; the Indian troops were opposed to fighting against revolutionaries, and a considerable part of the Indian troops are alleged to have gone over to Mirza Kutckuk. How far this is true, and how far it happens to be a mere bagatelle, we are not in a position to judge in view of the amazing secrecy with which the Mid-Eastern operations are being conducted. But it is time a strong lead were given to a movement demanding without cavil that Indian troops should not be used extra-territorially. AVhat has India to gain by sending, her sons to fight the sordid squabbles of international financiers ? Presently there will remain very few nations that Indians have not fought against, and that will be the time when India&apos;s fair name will begin to stink in the nostrils of all men of good intent throughout the world. And then what do we gain by it ? Practically in every part of the British Empire, where Indian troops have been employed to conquer and to win, the Indian is barred the door by the imposition of intolerable conditions. Is the lesson of Africa not one of portent and sorrow Africa won with the aid of Indian blood and sown with the brine of Indian tears ?Extract from the Pioneer Mail, dated 9th July 1920.Item 7 of the Non-Co-operation Programme reads as follows : &quot;Refusal to accept or to offer as units for the Army, especially in. Turkish territories now being administered in violation of the pledges.&quot;Copy of Letter dated the 25th July 1920, from All-Indta Moslem League,LUOKNOW,  TO   THE  SECRETARY  TO   THE GOVERNMENT   of  INDIA   (HOME   LePART-ment), Simla.I have the honour to invite the attention of the Government of India to the following resolution passed at the meeting of the Council of the League held on Sunday last: &quot; That the Council of the All-India Muslim League appeals to the Government of India to desist from sending any more Muslim or other Indian troops to the Middle East to be used against Mussulmans in repressing their patriotic and religious movement to avoid non-Muslim dominion or control and to withdraw such troops already there at an early date.&quot;It must be a matter of great concern to His Excellency the Viceroy as well as to His Majesty&apos;s Government, how trouble in Mesopotamia is growing. The continued outbreaks among Arab tribesmen there obviously imply that they are not prepared to
Extract from the Bombay Chronicle, dated 27th July 1920.India and Mesopotamia.It is time an emphatic voice was raised, against the irresponsible and reckless way in which the troops of this country we mean the Indian section thereof are being kept and utilised abroad for purposes of aggrandisement of interests which have little to do with either the safety or the welfare of this country, not to speak of the moral issues involved. No definite statement of the number of Indian troops detained abroad has been made public, but if we piece together the scrappy state-ments made from time to time by responsible British statesmen, we shall find that a total of about 100,000, if not more, would not be an exaggerated estimate of the aggregate number of these troops. Of this total, about 16,000 are stated to be in and around Constantinople, 65,000 in Mesopotamia, and a little over 7,000 in Persia. The strength of the Indian troops in Palestine, Egypt and the Red Sea region has not been announced. Leaving these aside, it is certain that at least 88,000 Indian troops are employed to garrison the Turkish Empire and Persia. If we now refer to the strength of the British troops employed in the same regions we shall find that only about a third of the Indian total is engaged there. The strength of the British troops in and around Constantinople has been stated to be about 1.4,000, as against 16,000 Indians, In Mesopotamia, according to the Daily Mail, there are 13,000 British as against 65,000 British-Indian troops, while in Persia there is a force of 9,000 troops, of which at least 7,000 are Indians. Thus in these regions there are in all only about 30,000 British troops, as against 88,000 Indian troops. Can British statesmen honestly maintain that the share of the burden which India.is called upon to bear is in any way proportionate to her &quot; Imperial&quot; obligations in the peace settlement ?It may be urged that the extra cost of maintaining these troops abroad falls on the British Exchequer. But what of the permanent cost of these troops, which India will have to shoulder, and in comparison with which the &quot; extra &quot; cost to be borne by Britain will be but a flea bite. Since the maintenance of these troops abroad will in no way affect the strength of the troops kept in India, it is an additional burden on India to have to maintain the overseas forces. hr spite of India&apos;s unparalleled and unstinting contributions in men and money during the last war there are still some ungrateful Britishers to-day who refuse to acknowledge that this country rendered great services to the Empire. What have they to say to the burdens which India is being forced to shoulder at present in the interests of militant Imperialism ? If the operations against Russia and Turkey are truly Imperial concerns,, why are not the &quot;patriotic&quot; Canadians, Australians and South Africans called upon to help the Empire? Why is India alone expected to accept the burdens? The reason is obvious. If the Colonies are appealed to to despatch troops they will be the first to repudiate the view that the economic Imperialism which finds favour with the British Foreign Office to-day is in any way &quot; patriotic &quot;or truly &quot; Imperial.&quot; Only helpless and voiceless India is obliged to acknowledge that these operations in all parts of 2281 A 2welcome British domination. So far as Indian Mussulmans are concerned, it has been sufficiently explained to the Government of India as well as to Bis Majesty&apos;s Government, that their religious obligations make it impossible for them to look with any favour or even to tolerate what is involved in such domination, namely, the disintegration of the Khilafat and the desecration of the sanctity of the Jazirat-ul-Arab. It is clear that if the British Government persist in their ambitions and endeavour to establish their military occupation throughout a great area of the Jazirat-ul-Arab the Empire will be involved in continuous warfare, far more difficult and expensive than has been the case with the North-Western Frontier in India. It is even more clear that it would be highly unjust to employ the ignorant and helpless Muslim and other Indian troops in such warfare against Mussulmans and Asiatics struggling against non-Muslim European domination, and that their employment would be greatly irritating to Mussulmans and therefore unacceptable to the Indians in this country.I hope, therefore, that the Government of India will see the justice of the appeal made in the resolution above quoted and take suitable action in accordance therewith to prevent the further exasperation of the Indian Mussulmans already smarting under grevious blows dealt to their religious susceptibilities by the Turkish policy of the British Cabinet.
the world are an &quot;Imperial &quot; affair, and she lias perforce to contribute her share  which always happens to be the &quot; lion&apos;s share &quot; when it is a question of sharing the burdens! The Bengali Regiment is disbanded on the score of economy by a Government which acquiesces in these unnecessary, wasteful and crushing military burdens being imposed on India. Apart -from the inherent objections which the country has to participating in Imperial adventures of doubtful utility or obvious inequity, the state of lndia&apos;s finances urgently requires a radical curtailment of military expenditure without delay. So long as Indian troops are kept abroad, there can be no substantial reduction of the crushing military burdens under which this country is groaning. It is time the Indian public raised its voice and entered a vigorous protest against the continued sacrifice of the interests of this country on the altar of imperialistic aggrandisement. India cannot afford further sacrifices of money and lives on these questionable enterprises, and must cry a halt in her own vital interests. In reply to Lord Robert Cecil, Mr. Lloyd G-eorge stated last week that he &quot;thought&quot; as though it was a matter on which his Government had not yet come to a definite decision that the cost of the reinforcements which were being sent to Mesopotamia from India would be borne by the British Exchequer. That, however, is not enough. It is not merely that the financial burden, whether direct or indirect, is unnecessary. There are two paramount considerations involved which affect the status and self-respect of India.The Indian people are bound to support all military undertakings of the British. Government which either have direct or indirect bearing on the defence of their country, or which are morally justifiable on high Imperial considerations.   The Mesopotamian adventure is not necessary for the defence of India.   The safety of India against any invasion through Mesopotamia could easily be secured by arrange-ment with any indigenous Government; the adventure is a naked act of territorial grab, an &quot; oil &quot; deal, which not only violates the Covenant of the League of Nations, but offends against the high purposes of the Great War the vindication of the principle of nationality and self-determination.   We say it, without fear of contra-diction, that there is not a single patriotic and thoughtful Indian whose conscience does not revolt against the manner in which the national aspirations of the Arabs are being sacrificed to the economic&apos; ambitions of military French and British &quot; Imperialism.&quot;   This is an all-prevailing consideration prompting the people of this country to declare that they will have nothing to do with the Mesopotamian adventure, and that if Britain wants to keep Mesopotamia let her do so with the help of her own men and her own money.   But that is not all.   There is the issue of the Khilafat and the dismemberment of Turkey.   The Moslems foel that non-Moslem control over any part of the Jazirat-ul-Arab is an outrage on their conscience and their religion. And their claim is not, as we have shown over and over again, incompatible with the fullest satisfaction of the national aspirations of the.Arabs, provided the Allies remain true to the high purposes of the war and allow the issue of the temporal suzerainty of the Sultan to be settled between the Turks, the Arabs, and the Moslems.  Again, the Arabs or at least a large section of them do not want British or French mandates.   If they did, why then this war against them in Mesopotamia and Syria ? So that all things considered, the military adventure in Mesopotamia as wrell as in Syria is, according to Indian opinion, not justifiable on high moral or political grounds.   Therefore, India cannot identify herself by giving any support 10 it.   The public opinion of the country has already expressed itself against the unjust and unrighteous treaty that is sought to be imposed on Turkey.   That opinion has been treated with contempt by British statesmen.   There is -only one way of protest left for the country.   She can ask that not one pie or one man should she be forced to contribute to further aims which have nothing to do with her Imperial obligations  and which are aims of sheer economic and territorial aggrandisement.   India will spend her last pie and shed the blood of her last man to avert the slightest menace to the Empire or to any part of it, but she is not bound to support any under-taking which is to benefit certain financial interests and to satisfy the personal ambitions of Lord Curzon and other &quot;Imperialists&quot; of his school.   That is the position sanctioned by the moral law which&apos; is at the basis of her connection with Britain ; that is also the position which India is entitled to maintain by virtue of her new status as an independent member of the League of Nations.   The issue Avas clearly defined by General Smuts in his speech in the South African House of Assembly, to which we referred the other day.   &quot;The British Empire,&quot; he said, &quot; to-day consisted of a number of free nations under a common sovereign, and the &quot; question was : how were they going to conduct the affairs of this Empire on a
Indian Demands.The following resolutions were unanimously passed at the meeting of Indian residents in England held at Essex Hall on 29th July: (1) That this public meeting of Indians resident in Great Britain and British sympathisers records its strong protest against Indian troops being used by the British Government to suppress the peoples of Mesopotamia, Arabia, Persia, Turkey and Egypt in their struggle to achieve national independence, and demands the immediate withdrawal of all troops so employed in those countries. (2) That this meeting of Indians appeals to all organi-sations working for International peace and against Imperialism and militarism to support their demand that Indian troops shall not be employed to such purposes. (3) That this meeting appeals to the electors of Great Britain to join with them in the demand for the withdrawal of Indian troops, and thus help to reduce the enormous addition to the existing unbearable burden of war debt.Indian Cannon Fodder. (By Syud Hossain (late Editor, the Independent).&quot;Large reinforcements have been ordered from India to Mesopotamia,&quot; Mr-Churchill announced in the House of Commons a week ago.The information vouchsafed by the War Minister raises a question of profound importance to India. Is there any limit to the use, or misuse, of Indian troops for purposes of imperialistic aggression or aggrandisement ? Are Indians mere mercenaries to be called upon to do dirty work for British war-lords in any or all parts of the world where they may find it inconvenient or impracticable to send men of their own race in sufficient numbers to serve as &quot; cannon fodder &quot; ? It is time an answer to these questions was forthcoming and the principle on which the British Government acts in employing Indian soldiery outside the borders of India clearly defined.Does anyone in this country know the actual number of Indian troops at present employed in (1) the &quot; Constantinople area,&quot; (2) &quot;Arabia,&quot; (3) &quot; North-East Persia,&quot; (4) &quot; North-West Persia,&quot; (5) &quot; Mesopotamia,&quot;&apos; (6) &quot; Palestine &quot; and (7) &quot; Egypt &quot; ? I suggest that some Member of Parliament should seek to extract the information. The task would not be easy. Mr. Montagu will probably be found, as usual, to be in a state of blissful ignorance what time he faithfully promises to communicate with fickle Simla on the subject.   And it would be easier to get at the founts of Mr.** common basis where they had no longer one Great Power speaking for the whole, &quot; but six independent and equal free members?&quot; India is one of the six, because . she is a member of the League of Nations in her own right. How is she to act on a question of foreign relations? Generals Smuts again gives the right reply. &quot;He would never agree,&quot; he said, &quot;to the voice of South Africa being coerced by a &quot; majority vote of the rest of the Empire ; and he was sure that the other Dominions &quot; would take up a similar position.&quot; Will India agree to her voice being coerced not by a majority vote, but by the mere executive fiat of only one member of the Empire-Britain ? If her voice is to be thus coerced after all her sacrifices in the war then her position as an equal member of the League of Nations is a delusion and Mr. Montagu&apos;s reforms a hypocritical sham. We are glad to see that the Council of the All-India Muslim League has expressed itself emphatically on this question by passing the following resolution : - .&quot; That the Council of the All-India Muslim League appeals to the Government of India to desist from sending any more Muslim or other Indian troops to the Middle East to be, used against Mussulmans in repressing their patriotic and religious movement to avoid non-Muslim dominion or control and to withdraw such troops already there at an early date.&quot;This demand must now be made by the united voice of India. We trust the All-India Congress Committee will bestir itself in the matter and that the question will be raised at the next meeting of the Imperial Council. There has already been a protest made in Parliament by Mr. Asquith against the Mesopotamian adventure. Outside Parliament there is also a growing feeling against it. India must begin to take part in mobilising a tremendous force of public opinion which, as General Smuts said, is essential in order to save the world from the chaos into which the Supreme Council has plunged it.
churchill&apos;s inner knowledge via Moscow than St. Stephen&apos;s. Then there is the omniscient band of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s private secretaries, but they specialise in knowledge which is guaranteed to yield no profit to lesser mortals than the &quot; Big-Three.&quot; Their figures especially, as we know, have a delightful way of responding variously, as the needs of the occasion may demand, to the atmospheric pressure of Downing Street, San Reino, and Spa.Wanted Facts.These difficulties notwithstanding, it is a matter of the utmost urgency and importance, alike for the British and Indian peoples, to get at the facts-and, the figures. In the Great War hundreds of thousands of Indians took part; tens of thousands of them laid down their lives. This sacrifice had undoubtedly behind it the moral sanction and support of the vast bunk of the Indian people. They believed then, like the rest of the world, that they were assisting in a war of liberation, and incidentally hastening the hour of their own deliverance.Of the disillusion that has since come to them among others, I need-not now speak. One word &quot; Amritsar&quot; sums up the totality of the tragedy and the treachery that has since overwhelmed India. And not in our time will that searing memory be healed. But if Indian public opinion was behind Indian participation in the Great War, it is equally certain that Indian public opinion is, and has been,, violently opposed to the employment of Indian soldiery in the tasks which have since been assigned, to it.The New &quot; Empire.&quot;Everyone knows, or should know, that India abhors the whole scheme of a &quot; new Middle Eastern Empire,&quot; and the other unconscionable and liberty-destroying adventures on which Mr. George, Mr. Churchill, and Lord Curzon are embarked. It. follows, therefore, that the use of Indian troops to crush other nations to many of whom the Indian people are united by ties of race, religion, and community of culture --is a two-fold curse; a curse to Indians and a curse to those whom they are compelled to victimise. The abomination is made possible only by perfected military organisation of British rule in India, for I have no hesitation in saying that there is not a single Indian Hindu, Moslem, or Sikh who would willingly offer to take the life of his Persian, Syrian, Arab, or Egyptian brother, or help to reduce others to the subjection under which he himself labours.A Ghastly Irony.Yet that is the task in. which he is being increasingly employed. Being a slave himself, he must needs labour to enslave others. The ghastly irony of this piece of international immorality is now being keenly realised in India; that it is being also^ realised elsewhere is shown by a recent incident of which I was told by my friend Shaikh M. H. Kidwai, barrister-at-law, who has just returned from India. On the same boat with him travelled a number of distinguished. Sikhs, whose distinctive appearance with the imposing turban makes them conspicuous everywhere. When the ship reached Port Said everyone, as usual, got out. The Sikh gentlemen went into a restaurant to have a meal, whereupon the Egyptian proprietor of the restaurant ordered them out, saying that if their people could find nothing better to do than to^ come and help to garrison Egypt, they must not look for hospitality at the hands of any Egyptian. ;In other words, the name of Indians has been made to stink in the nostrils of other nations by their (virtually) compulsory employment as mercenaries. But Indians are not mercenaries, and do not propose to go on being exploited in this, manner any longer.On 2nd August Mushir Husain Kidwai wrote from the Hotel Wagram, Rue de Rivoli, Paris, a letter to J. M. Parikh in London. The substance of the letter is as follows:  ,     .Kidwai explains that &quot;the idea is &quot; to form a permanent committee to agitate for the recall of Indian troops from abroad and to work in co-operation with other inter-national and Labour committees.   Mrs. Sarojini Naidu is to be asked to be President.
