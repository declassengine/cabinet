a - %SUMMARY,RUSSIA.The Bolsheviks appear firmly resolved to occupy Warsaw and Sovietise Poland, though there has been a difference of policy among them as to whether their intention should be openly stated or not. One party thinks that the establishment of a Soviet Government in Poland will not be understood by the British working classes and will be taken by them as a sign of Bolshevik Imperialism : the other considers that the position of England is already so much embarrassed that the Bolshevik Government may safely avow its whole programme. The former view prevails among those who have been in longer and more intimate contact with England. The latter is held at Moscow and by the more recently arrived Bolshevik delegates, who insist on the import-ance, for the division of the Allies, and the encouragement of anti-British movements in Ireland, Persia, Egypt and India, of an open and palpable success in Poland. It is probable that the second view will prevail and that the Bolsheviks will demand the capitulation of Wrangel, the recall of all foreign Missions from Poland, and the complete control of Poland by Russia.In the East the Bolsheviks consider that their position is growing stronger and that the Anglophile anti-Soviet front is much shaken. They attribute this to their movement in Persia. The reported flight of Mirza Kucb.uk they consider unimportant, as they rely on his commander-in-chief as more competent to play the part. They believe a Soviet Persia is bound to eome.The Soviet Government appears not to fear Japan, which it thinks cannot finance expensive military expeditions, and will finally be obliged to withdraw from Chita, and to concentrate its forces in Vladivostock and on the East coast.At the Congress of the Third International in Moscow, Lenin agreed to the use for the present of Parliamentary as against Direct Action, on the ground that the mass of workers and peasants throughout the world believe in Parliament, and that &quot; we must demonstrate its futility for revolutiouary purposes.&quot;There appears to be little hope of obtaining raw materials or manu-factured articles from Soviet Russia for many years to come. A com-petent authority estimates that the time required to make the railway service in Russia efficient will be 27 years at the present rate of output in Government establishments. The Soviet Government is sending contingents of town workers, unemployed owing to the closing of works and factories, to country towns and villages. The return to the land is, in Russia, a reversion to type. It is probable that by so doing it is strengthening the solid barrier against Communism which the population of Russia really constitutes.It has been definitely proved that the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is now an official and subsidised organ in this country of the Soviet Government. It is to receive 50,000 francs a month for six months from Litvinoff. Francis Meynell has already received a sum on account of the subsidies and further payments are to be made on the sale of certain Chinese bonds.The Economic Section for the Electrification of Agricultural Industries in Soviet Russia holds that Russian small ownership must be abolished and the supply and control of mechanical power centralised as a step to the regeneration of the industrial and agricultural transport of Russia.a 2
The decay of the Kussian Church and the formation of a great number of small sects, some of them probably of a very strange character, is considered probable.The absolute nature of the nationalisation of trade and commerce, by the Bolshevik regime is described in an official decree regarding foreign trade extracted from the official organ of the Soviet Government.The adherence of the Jewish organisations in Russia to the Com-mnnist Party has been gradual and is thought characteristic of the qualities of adaptability in the Jewish race.GERMANY.German extremists think that matters in Germany will shortly come to a head because the Government will eventually get into the hands of the Right and because of the discontent among the workers, due to the 10 per cent, tax on wages.DENMARK.The International Clearing House at Copenhagen has been a com-plete disappointment to the Soviet authorities, the gold deposited failing to secure the credit required.ITALY.- The Giolitti Government, which represents all parties and groups is reported to be in favour with the public, and the country as a whole is steadying clown.SPAIN.Though the state of the country is still unsettled a more optimistic feeling prevails, the workmen realising that continual strikes bring little grist to the mill. .  .PRANCE.The-failure of the General Strike last May and the firm action of the Government on that occasion has led to a Recline of the revolutionary spirit and to recrimination between the labour leaders which is unlikely to subside until the Assembly of the Congres Confederal in August.HOLLAND.A split has occurred in the Dutch Communist Party. Mrs. Roland Hoist, Dr. Gorter and Anton Pannekoek have severed their connection with it and now work in opposition to Wynkoop and his associates.SWEDEN.Competent observers consider that all Bolshevik trade affairs in Sweden have really been carried out with a view to impressing England and exerting an influence on the Krassin negotiations.PORTUGAL.Unrest in Portugal is being reduced by the continual outward flow of emigrants to America.SOUTH AFRICA.The situation generally is disquieting, the racial feeling between the Dutch and British again being acute,- while the native question is also becoming menacing.CANADA.The situation in Canada . is governed by two serious possibilities, the shortage of coal and an impending demand by the railway unions for the schedule of wages demanded in the United States.
AUSTRALIA.The revolutionary movement in Australia is reported to be smothered by its own excess of organisers. The revolutionary publications of Simoneff, the Soviet Governments representative, are reported to be swallowing up a lot of money.ARGENTINE.An interesting experiment to deal with Labour unrest started in Buenos Aires by the head of Thompsons Furniture Company is reported.WEST INDIES.Considerable racial feeling is stated to exist in Trinidad and St. Lucia.
CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.Extremists.The failure of the General Strike last May and the firm action of the Government on that occasion has led to a decline in the revolutionary spirit in France. Convinced extremists are not, of course, likely to give up their opinions or to relinquish the aims which they intended to pursue, but many of those whom they induced to side with them are discouraged.The report of a delegate to the Communist Congress held at Milan last April is quoted as an indication of the tactics the Communists pro-posed to pursue, a course in which the failure of the great strike in May has probably tended to confirm them : &quot; Militarism has still the upper hand and a Communist agitation on a large scale is not to be thought of. Too much has still to be done secretly. For that reason the Communists support all strike move-ments and dissatisfaction. Their tactics is to weaken and overthrow the Government by as many strikes as possible. On account of the watch kept by detectives it is still impossible to draw up lists for a workers&apos; army. However, preparations will soon be made to do this, especially in Marseilles and the neighbourhood of Lyons, in which districts there are about 10,000 Communists organised. .... In order that the Party may work with success the &apos; Communiste&apos; and &apos; Le Soviet&apos; will from now on receive a great deal of support.&quot;In a memorandum sent by the French Bolsheviks to Moscow via, Stockholm, in addition to complaints of the decline in revolutionary spirit in France, they mention the large number of agents provocateurs, directed by they know not whom, who are workiug amongst them. The authors of the memorandum say that in future the work must be carried on in secret and propaganda schools should be founded at the ports, as in England and America. They ask the Soviet Government for 100,000 frs. a month for this purpose, 600,000 frs. to be paid in advance.Frederick Strom in Sweden has sent 200,000 kr. to Vodovosof, the Bolshevik delegate now virtually Ambassador in Rome, for propaganda work in France. The money is to be used primarily to assist the agents whose organisation was broken up on the arrest of Loriot.A new extremist organisation known as &quot; UEducatrice &quot; has just been formed in Paris. It consists mainly of some 50 intellectual revolu-tionaries, pronounced agitators of the Parti Socialiste, who have founded the new group because of their dissatisfaction with the timidity and hesitations of the old.   The founder and leader of the new organisation
is known as Andre Lery, but tins name is believed to disguise the identity of someono much more important. Other prominent members of &quot; D Educatrice &quot; are Paul Brnlat and Emile (or Frank) Piguot.Certain members of the Croupe Clarte have suggested that their next meeting shall be held in London, a proceeding which the Belgians, Dutch, and Russians are said to favour as against the Italians, French, Serbs, Jugo-Slavs, Germans, and Austrians, who are opposed to it.Jannson, Russian Yice-Consi.il at Bergen, formerly at Kirkness, is shortly proceeding to Paris via Copenhagen with four Russian officers to persuade the Russian colony in Paris to join the Bolsheviks on nationalist grounds.Relations between Socialists and Extremists.French Socialists, are reported to be displaying a tendency to abandon the Left and rally to the Centre. At the National Socialist Congress on July 4th a motion demanding adhesion to the Third Inter-national and&apos; immediate supersession of capitalist poAver by a proletariat government &quot;was defeated, only obtaining 1,351 votes against 2,874 in favour of a resolution demanding the liberation of those arrested during the strike, reinstatement of the men dismissed, and the abandonment of proceedings against the Confederation Generale du Travail. The reso-lution passed also affirmed the agreement of the Socialist Party with the Trades Unions and Co-operative Societies. During the last few weeks, however, agreements have been concluded between the French Socialists proper and the revolutionary element amongst the Syndicalists which show that these two forces&apos;are uniting for action.A member of the French Socialist Delegation, at present in Moscow, has written that as the price of co-operation between the Russian and the French proletariats, Lenin is demanding that all further discussion as to adherence to the Pacte International be abandoned by the French Socialists, and that from now on they advocate only the Third Inter-national, while adopting at once a genuinely revolutionary mode of action.Marcel Cachin, French Extreme Socialist Deputy, was in touch with Kopp before his withdrawal from Berlin. Cachin then went to Kovno, where he was to meet the-Soviot delegates and discuss means for preventing French assistance to Poland.   Cachin was in Moscow in June.National Federation of Railway Workers.Since the failure of the General Railway Strike in May, the Federa-tion of Railway Workers has held a referendum amongst the railwaymen then dismissed, asking if they were prepared to go to Russia to work at the re-organisation of railways in that country. Almost all the men concerned replied in the affirmative, and the Railwaymen&apos;s Federation, supported by the Confederation Generale du Travail, has been organising convoys. The Confederation Generale du Travail were prepared to meet the refusal on the part of the Government to grant passports by a demand that the 4,000 odd dismissed railwaymen should be reinstated by the-Railway Companies, and took measures to prepare propaganda in case of a refusal on the part of the Companies. The Compagnie du Nord has announced its intention to pay a gratuity to all servants of the company who remained at their posts without interruption during the Railway Strike.   -Bidegaray has been re-elected secretary of the National Federation of Railway Workers. An extremist and in favour of direct action, Bidegaray was only relieved of his post before the strike because he believed the time for such extreme action had not yet come.
Labour.The defeat of the recent strike has led to recrimination between the Labour leaders which is unlikely to subside until the assembly of the Congres Confederal in August. At that congress the Confederation Generate du Travail will have to decide either (1) to continue to allow itself to be led and governed by the extremists among the l-ailwaymen and others, or (2) to dominate these extremists and force them to fall in with a scheme for the improvement of the public services, mines,, banks, &amp;c, on the lines laid dowu by the Couseil Economique du Travail. Many Labour leaders think that it will take at least six months for the various Labour Unions to recover their vitality. Meanwhile, Jouhaux and de Moulin will have lost their authority. Unrest among the French industrial workers accompanied by local strikes seems likely to continue until the end of the year.Miscellaneous.Competent observers trace the Press Campaign against the &quot;Im-perialist&quot; policy of Great Britain to M. Briand, who has his eye on the succession to M. Millerand, and is seeking to overthrow him. M. Briand is the representative among French public men of the Jewish Masonic influence, so closely allied to International High Finance and to Herr Hugo Stinnes, the most powerful of the German &quot; Heavy &quot; Industrials. It is noteworthy in this connection that M. Caillaux, the martyr of High Finance, has recently proclaimed that &quot; At least they (his oppressors) cannot deprive me of my pen.&quot; The present campaign is intended to defame the policy &quot;of England, to blacken anyone who has worked, or who appears willing to work amicably with her, and so to sap the prestige of both M. Clemenceau as a possible candidate for the succession of M. Deschauel, and of M. Millevand, whose firm will to maintain the Entente is feared.The state of affairs as regards domestic food production, upon which political stability so largely depends, is gradually improving in France. The official figures still show a considerable deficit in the production of almost every kind of grain suitable for foodstuffs. Last year it was found necessary to import 40 million cwt. of grain front America. This year&apos;s harvest is estimated at 65 million cwt. as against 76 million in 1914, and an average of 88 million for the preceding 10 years. Adverse weather may still increase the deficiency. In competent circles, neverthe-less, hopes are still expressed that if proper precautions are taken it will not he necessary to import very large quantities of grain from America or elsewhere.BELGIUM.Revolutionary Propaganda.Belgium as a whole contiuues to give an example of sanity to the rest of the world. The Belgian Government decided in June to raise the Russian blockade and to endeavour to re-establish trade com-munications. It is stipulated, however, that the commercial and other rights of Belgium in Russia should be respected.Only in one direction does an increase in revolutionary activities appear, The Jeunes Gardes Socialistes, led by Joseph Jacquemotte, are intensifying their propaganda against compulsory military service. Joseph Jacquemotte appears to be in the way of becoming the recognised chief of the revolutionary movement in Belgium. The circulation of his organ, &quot; L&apos;Exploite,&quot; which is described as the most active and
dangerous revolutionary paper in the country, is reported to be increasing, as a result of the anti-militarist meetings its editor organises in the mining and manufacturing areas. The Belgian Labour Party has refused to recognise it as in any way representative of organised labour, whose official voice is now heard in the &quot; Peuple,&quot; the &quot; Vooruits,&quot; and the &quot;Volksgazet.&quot; &apos;Official labour, in fact, appears a little afraid of Jacquemotte, who is also opposed, but in a diminishing degree, by the Federation Communiste Beige and its organ, &quot; LVOuvrier Comrnuniste.&quot; The progress made by this society is small. Its paper is in a bad way, and Henri Clais, its secretary, refuses to diselose the number of its members.Apart from Jacquemotte and his newspaper, an increase in the distri-bution (it is said from Paris) of revolutionary pamphlets and papers has been remarked.Labour.On 9th June a meeting of the committee of Workers&apos; Unions was held at Brussels, at which practically all branches of labour were repre-sented. The general programme of action to be referred to the various unions was discussed. This includes the organisation of a campaign for a minimum salary of 3 francs an hour for workers in Brussels ; the adoption of all the points put forward at the Congress of the Belgian Labour Party to combat the high cost of living; and energetic action to end the present state of war with Soviet Russia. In view of the threatened unemployment a resolution was also passed calling on the Government to introduce forthwith an eight hours day for all workers.The Return of the Germans.There is much resentment at the number of German subjects whom M. Vandervelde, the Minister of Justice, is allowing to return to Belgium. M. Vandervelde is known to covet the presidency of the &quot; Internationale,&quot; and is doing his utmost to ingratiate himself with the Socialist parties in Belgium and Germany. Of all this his colleagues are aware and disapprove, and it is thought an early opportunity of removing him may be taken.ITALY.The Government.The Giolitti Government is reported to be in favour with the public. The. Cabinet, with the exception of the Minister of Public Instruction, a philosopher and historian, is formed of ex-Ministers of the three pre-ceding Nitti Cabinets. It represents all parties and groups and consists of three Radical, two Catholic, two Reformist Socialists, three Liberal Democrats, and three Liberal Conservative Ministers. Curiously enough its strength lies in the three leaders of the Radical government and Reformist Socialist parties, Fera, Meda, and Bonomi, who were chosen by Signor Orlando after the disaster of Caporetto to form a Coalition Cabinet and unite all parties. A Cabinet so composed is not considered likely to change either the foreign or internal policy of its predecessors. The latter is summarised in a circular to the Prefects as follows: &quot; Social justice, financial and economic reconstruction and obedience to the law,&quot; a programme general enough to contain many possibilities of success or failure.Since the advent of Giolitti the relations between the Vatican and the Italian Government have gradually improved. The King of Italy is reported to have told the Pope that he would abdicate as soon as the
majority of the people indicate that they had a real desire to do away with the Monarchy.Fiume. The League of Oppressed Nations.Two adventurers operating with d&apos;Annuuzio, Henry first and Leon Kochnitsky, have for some time past been working to link up the interests of &quot; Oppressed Nations &quot; and make Fiume the headquarters of an &quot; International&quot; of this kind. The business in Fiume is run on the same lines as John de Kay&apos;s Vcrein vervolgter Volker in Berlin. Kochnitsky has agents in many countries and a courier service for delivering letters to them ; and delegates from Egypt and India haunt d&apos;Anuunzio&apos;s palace. The &quot; Oppressed Peoples &quot; in whom d&apos;Annunzio is particularly interested are the Croats and Slovenes. D&apos;A&quot;nnunzio has declared that he may one day appear in Agram as the liberator of the former. Other &quot; Oppressed Nations,&quot; according to first, are Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, Russia, India, Ireland, China, Morea, and the Negroes of the United States, anything in fact which could be used to cripple the action of the Entente should it be compelled to make a stand against a German-Russian alliance. The whole atmosphere of Fiume and the anti-capitalist utterances of first and other hangers-on of the poet, as well as the particular brand of extremism apparent in some of their communiques, are strongly suggestive of the communism to which the poet and his political advisers are inclined, even if we were not apprised that d&apos;Annunzio is himself in touch, through Kochnitsky, with Lenin.Albania is represented on the committee of the League of Oppressed Nations recently established in Rome by one Akram Bey, who inci-dentally was behind the recent murder of Essad Pasha in Paris. Essad&apos;s recent hostility to Italy and friendship for Serbia apparently decided his fate. Akram Bey, with an eye to Signor Giolitti&apos;s policy for the creation of an &quot;Independent&quot; Albania, favours an alliance with Italy against Serbia, and especially against Greece.Eastern Intrigue.An Italian Mission headed by a protege of Count Sforza, who has since become the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited Angora in June, with instructions to offer the Nationalists not only the moral support of Italy, but aid more immediate and material in the shape of a loan of 3,000,000 lira and a quantity of captured Austrian war material. The Italians were to receive certain mining concessions and cereals to be exported through Adalia. The Nationalist press was at that time treating Italy more kindly than the other Entente powers, and it was surmised that under the Giolitti Ministry, relations between Italy and the Turkish Nationalists would become more*cordial. It is interesting to note that the &quot;Tripolitan Standard,&quot; a paper very anti-British in character, and loud in the praise of- the Italian Government, is edited in Turkey by Italian agencies.The Italian Socialist Party.The Italian Socialist Party have now gone so far as to advertise their loan in the &quot; Avanti,&quot; with the appeal to the public to &quot; subscribe to the loan for revolutionary preparation.&quot; Originally the object of the loan was announced as being connected with propaganda in Southern Sicily, but this announcement was merely a precaution taken by the Socialists for fear that the Government would take measures to prevent the loan from being issued. As, however, no such measures were taken, the real object of the loan was announced quite openly, and every Socialist paper
*n Italy has been urging the proletariat to contribute money to raise funds for the Revolution. Several million lire have been raised, and as the loan is continuous and will never be closed up, it is obvious that it can never prove a failure. -Labour and Revolutionary Unrest.The effect of the weak and hesitating policy of the old Government is only now becoming fully apparent in the gradual perfecting of the organisation for revolutionary action and propaganda of the advanced Socialists, the Anarchists, and other allies among the Labour organisations, such as the General Confederation of Labour and the Federation of Seamen. It is said that the mo3t likely pretexts to be seized by the Anarchists to justify a revolt are trouble at Trieste, the high cost of living, and the increase in the price of bread, and outbreaks similar to that of Ancona, which are predicted in different parts of Italy, will synchronise with a general strike, including the railways and post office employees throughout the country.The head of the Italian Secret Service is reported to have said recently in conversation that he would not be surprised if a revolution broke out. All the strikes, he said, were of an essentially political character, the labouring classes had got all they wanted, they knew that their wages could not be increased, and yet they were practically always on strike, with the double object of avoiding work and helping the Socialists to capture economic and political power. Unfortunately, he said, the bulk of the people were thus becoming gradually convinced that if it were not for the Socialists they would be paying twice as much for their bread as they are paying uoav. He declared that the Socialists were getting money, possibly from Russia, though, he said, the Bolsheviks were not sending funds direct to Italy but were doing so either through France or through Switzerland. In view of what is known regarding the direct representation of the Soviet Republic in Italy in the person of Michael Vodovosov, Signor Gasparri&apos;s statement regarding the necessary indirectness of communication Avith Russia in all probability no longer holds good. Vodovosov is shortly to give place to the Commissar Vorovsky, upon whose arrival full relations, diplomatic and commercial, may be said to have been established.Communist Flans.The policy of the Communists in Italy is displayed in a letter by Herbert Droz, written from Italy to a Swiss fellow-communist at Berne on May 12th and describing a Communist Conference held at Milan : &quot; The Italian comrades have been able not only to establish contact with the East, but also to act as intermediaries between the Russian comrades Russia and the offices and comrades of Europe.&quot; The Italian proletariat is quite well enough armed to enable the revolutionary movement to begin atc any given moment. The Italian proletariat could without difficulty,(1) Seize the civil and military power.(2) Organise Communist production and land-holding.&quot;But Italy, deprived of its natural wealth and having no granaries, could not stand alone against the armies of international &apos;. reaction. The Italian comrades will bring off their coup d&apos;etat on that day, when they are sure of their neighbours&apos; support.&quot; The Red Army does not exist, but the Italian proletariat will form one, without difficulty, at the necessary moment.
&quot; On the motion of the Italian comrades the Conference decided inter alia, to create one sole bureau for Europe.   Further, for the development of international relations, it was decided to found Diplomatic Representatives of the Communists in all countries.   In Italy there is one already.With regard to this letter it is interesting to note &apos;(a) How largely the question of obtaining grain has bulked inthe Italian Governments recent transactions, both with the Soviet Government and with Nationalist Turkey.(b) The reports from different sources confirming, the abuse ofthe Italian diplomatic bag in helping communications between various centres of revolution and sedition both in the East and elsewhere.(c) The fact that Michael Vodovosov, the Soviet Governmentsrepresentative in Italy, has recently been granted quasi-diplomatic powers, which will, be passed, with increase, to his successor.The Army on Police Duty.The morale of the Italian army is reported not to have diminished despite the reverses in Albania and Tripoli, which the Socialists have been exploiting, and the fact that it has for the last two months been continually employed on police duty in garrisons throughout Italy, repressing riots of a more or less serious character. Cases of insubordina-tion on the part of soldiers have been rare. During the strikes and riots the troops called out on police duty never hesitated to use their arms, and collaborated perfectly with the Carbineers and police. It is thought certain that the troops can be relied upon in case of emergency, a fact due to the strict discipline maintained and the excellent relations between the troops and their officers. The mutiny of the Arditi at Trieste does not impugn the above statement. In the first place only 60 men out of 2,000 actually mutinied, notoriously bad characters who knew that they were presently to sail for Albania. Not unwisely they were given their heads in Trieste for the two days before their departure, and Socialists got into touch with them and fed them well and gave them all the wine they wanted. Before the Arditi were due to sail the 60 returned to barracks and voluntarily rejoined their comrades although they were aware of the punishment awaiting them.Boycott on the Transport of War Material.The agitation of the railwaymen, which has assumed a quasi-permanent character, is undoubtedly instigated and encouraged by the revolutionary Socialists bent on creating difficulties for the new Giolitti Cabinet and on preventing reinforcements from being sent to Albania. There have been partial strikes of railwaymen all over the country and a general refusal to transport troops or to handle anything in the way of war material, measures which have very much the same effect on transport as a general strike would have.British stores, &amp;c, for the Danube Station were held up by the &apos; railwaymen until the British Consul-General at Trieste gave a declaration that stores and ammunition going on by rail to the Danube were ex. clusively for the British detachment there and would in no case be used against Soviet Russia.There is one real danger in the boycott; no war material of any kind is being exported from the country and large stores of rifles and ammuni-tion are scattered all over Italy at stations and on quays, watched over
by railwaymen and seamen, who, in case of a revolution, could use it themselves or hand them over to the revolutionaries. It will be seen, therefore, that the Italian proletariat is in possession, or can possess, large quantities of arms without much difficulty, and the fact is not without bearing upon the general situation, whether or not it constitutes a motive for the boycott.SPAIN.The general outbreak, for which the Germans were reported to be working through Felix Graupera, has not taken place. A split within the Federation Patronal practically caused the suspension of its activities in Barcelona. The dissension, which placed Graupera and his pro-German friends at the head of the organisation, resulted in the almost total cessation of subscriptions from sources other than German. Miro y Trepat, who, on being accused by Graupera of malversation of the Society&apos;s funds, left the organisation and the country, was rich, and contributed much to the party funds; but he was also pro-Ally. His departure, along with similar defections, have at least temporarily left the pro-Germans stranded, and their costly secret police has had to be abolished.The Syndicates are now believed to be without sufficient money for a movement of any importance. Signs are not wanting, moreover, that the workmen are realising that continual strikes bring little grist to the mill, and that they are really very well off without them. Though the state of Spain is still unsettled, a more optimistic feeling prevails. There is, of course, a prevalence of partial strikes, but the movement now lacks the cohesion necessary for a general upheaval.Barcelona Syndicalists were restive early in June, because all political prisoners had not been released under the amnesty. Senor Frederico * Cados Bas, the new Governor, however, made the amnesty fully effective, and the trouble subsided. Madrid and Valencia are uow practically normal. In Andalucia, also, the men, most of whom are now earning good wages and working short hours, are showing a much more accom-accommodating spirit than hitherto. Much of this is due to the Sindicatos Catolicos, which have realised that content for the men largely consists in having land of their own and capital to buy plants, manure, seeds, &amp;c., . at a normal rate of interest. Rich landowners have subscribed liberally to the scheme, with results so far entirely satisfactory.PORTUGAL.Economics.The root causes of unrest in Portugal appear more than ever to be the high cost of living, which since 1914 has risen 900 per cent., and the wretched quality of the standard bread. Industrial disturbances in the country all, in the last resort, go back to these. Unrest is being reduced by the continual outward flow of emigrants to America. Unfortunately this cure for fever also saps the quality of the breed and the vitality of the people.Crops have, however, been good in Portugal this year and the Government is in treaty with the Argentine for further supplies of wheat, so that, given passable administration of the food supply, the outlook would appear to be more hopeful.
Political and Revolutionary.The death on June 8 th of the late Prime Minister, M. Batista, deprived the country of a firm and wise administrator, to whose strength of character in difficult circumstances the gradual progress of Portugal towards industrial and economic reconstruction was greatly due. His successor, Antonio Maria da Silva, formerly President of the Republican Guard, beat his own previous record as a Prime Minister by holding office exactly one month. He succeeded to a troubled inheritance. All Lisbon is in a state of nerves. During the funeral of the late Prime Minister a motor car began to backfire, whereupon people near by thought that bombs were being thrown, and a panic ensued which it took some time to allay.The Central Communist Party in Lisbon, whose sessions are said to be attended by members of the Republican Guard, have split on the question of explosives as a means for the establishment of the proletariat. The Lisbon police. have been carrying out raids on suspected Bolshevist centres and have made many arrests and discoveries of arms such as daggers and razors, the latter of which are favourite weapons of attack among the lower classes. Serious political import can scarcely be attributed to a conspiracy so rudimentary.There is said also to be some unrest in Monarchist circles because an amnesty covering the last Monarchist rising has not been granted, and most of those implicated in it have been imprisoned for 18 months without trial.The &quot; Batalha.&quot;The extremist newspaper, &quot;Batalha,&quot; is still in a bad way and is trying to obtain monthly contributions from the syndicates through the Portuguese C.G.T. The syndicates are, however, unwilling contributors, and unless money reaches it from abroad the paper will probably go under.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. NORWAY.Relations of the late and present Government with Soviet Russia.The approaches noted in previous issues of these reports of the late Liberal Government towards closer relations with Soviet Russia have been temporarily suspended by the assumption of Office by a Ministry of more conservative tendencies. As a further instance of the efforts made by the late Government for a rapprochement with Soviet Russia a wireless message sent to Tchitcherine on June 16th by the late Norwegian Foreign Minister may be quoted. It was sent in the name of the Geophysical Institute of Bergen asking for the participation of officials in the Meteorological Institutes at Moscow and Petrograd in a meeting of geophysicians to be held at. Bergen during August.The change of Government is attributed to two causes : the dislike of the country to prohibition, introduced by the late Government, and the dependence of the Government on the Socialist vote. It was predicted that the new Cabinet would not last long and the Socialists were believed likely to pursue a policy of giving it enough rope to hang itself by reactionary legislation.Mr. Martin Tranmael, the extremist Office holder of the National Labour Party, who is regarded as the principal representative in Norway of Soviet Russia, would, it was thought, take advantage of the new
Governments situation for propaganda purposes by formulating as&apos; a&apos; programme reduction of military expenditure and of the present cost of living and the re-opening of trade relations with Russia.Litvinoff, about the middle of June, proposed to go from Copenhagen to Christiania to discuss.the opening up of trade relations, and he is said to have been at pains to have a report compiled for the purpose regarding the economic situation in Mumansk. The rapidly developing crisis in the European situation, however, intervened and his journey was postponed.Murmansk Propaganda Bureau.The news of the establishment at Murmansk of a school for inter-national Bolshevik propaganda under the direction of Schlovsky, a Bolshevik Commissar, has now received confirmation. A school for the instruction of Norwegians and others in the methods of spreading Bolshevik propaganda through Norway to all countries has been founded there and different Communist Parties are being invited to send pupils.Schlovsky went to Christiania in order to start a Soviet Propaganda Bureau in Norway.Martin Tranmael was reported in June to be contemplating a trip &apos; along the Nonvegian coast in order to start agitation among the fishing community.There appears to be several centres for the distribution of Bolshevik propaganda in Christiania and special agents are commissioned to dis-tribute literature at the Sunday gatherings ami in the country districts.Syndicalists.Further reports establish the duplicity for propaganda purposes of Norwegian syndicalists. At a secret preliminary meeting held behind closed doors before the Norwegian Syndicalist Conference at the end of May the Danish Syndicalists, Christensen, and the Swedish delegates Strom and Kilbom frankly declared that in spite of the support given to the cause by Soviet Russia and of the most intense propaganda the revolutionary movement had made small headway in Scandinavia. The working classes, they said, were quite platonic in such assent as they gave to the Bolshevik programme and all suggestions of a revolutionary movement were stifled by their passive resistance. - At the final meeting, however, which followed the leading delegates maintained that the revolutionary movement was developing rapidly and resolutions were passed by a large majority, with every sign of enthusiasm and belief, in favour of the Third International and the establishment of a Soviet regime in Norway.The Norwegian Syndicalists Federation, whose programme is the control of economic life by mass industrial action, is approximately 20,000 strong. Its headquarters at Christiania work under the direction of ZinoviefF. It has a weekly organ called &quot; Alarm,&quot; which is edited by one Carl 0. Tangen. With other extreme organisations and with the Young Socialists it forms the extreme section of the Norwegian Labour-Party which for tactical purposes it supports, although it adopts neither TranmaePs Soviet programme on the Russian model nor Puntevold&apos;s more constitutional methods. jThe National Labour Party and the Young Socialists.The National Labour Party at a secret session in Christiania at the beginning of June decided to found two new schools for propaganda to establish a Bolshevik Press, to organise formations for the future Red Army, and to send two special delegates, probably Tranmael and Hansen, to Moscow.
The Executive Committee of the National Labour Party, 10 out of 14 of whom including Kyrre Grepp, Emil Stang, Martin Tranmael, and Olav Scheflo are violent extremists, has promised to assist in the organisation of an International News service, wireless Press, &amp;c, to be used in support of the Communist movement.The Union of Young Socialists, who represent the Norwegian Labour Intelligenzia and the younger Radicals, is said to have ample funds to carry on propaganda through the summer. Their influence, under the leadership of Eugene Olaussen, is said to be increasing.National Organis..   i of Trade Unions.It was believ:&apos; u June that Schlapnikoff had taken part in a then recent Bolshevik (.&apos;-. ess in Christiania which had met for the orgauisa-tion of an international revolutionary Trade Union. At the general meeting of the National Congress of Trades Unions of Norway held in the middle of July at Christiania, resolutions were passed in favour of organising workers&apos; committees in all factories and workshops to secure control of production as a step to nationalisation, the adoption of the Soviet system, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. This undoubtedly constitutes an .attempt on the part of the extremists to overthrow the present system of Trade Unionism. These extremists are led by Alfred Madsen, whose centre of activity is Tronghem and whose programme is based on the Third International pure and simple.Madsen is believed to be receiving funds from Moscow to finance the publishing house of the Norwegian Trade Union Opposition, from which there issues a steady flow of pamphlets inciting workmen to revolution.SWEDEN.Communists and the Question of the Aaland Islands.Swedish Communists have beeu advised byLitvinoff not to attack the Branting Government on the Aaland question, as such action might lead public opinion in Sweden to regard them as traitors to their country. Branting, who considers that he has the support of both Germany and the Bolsheviks, is for settling the Aaland question through the League of. Nations.Relations with Soviet Russia.Competent observers consider that all Bolshevik trade affairs in Sweden have really been carried out with a view to impressing England and exerting an influence on the Krassin negotiations.The gold deposits in Stockholm are reported to be well in advance of the deliveries of the goods, which cannot have been exported to anything like the value of the gold. It is considered, therefore, not unlikely that some of the gold has been used to finance early production and deliveries with the object of getting trade started and so securing opportunities of propaganda.It is reported that the Bolsheviks have completed negotiations with Sweden for the purchase of Lyndquist and Holms locomotive works. The Swedes are demanding forest concessions and certain rights intheDonetz Basin in return for their sanction of the purchase.Extremists.At an International Congress held in Italy in April it was resolved that the Western European Secretariat should be transferred to Stockholm 0 11687 b
and should receive 50 million Swedish crowns for the purpose of supporting revolutionary movements in foreign countries.Frederick Strom is now reliably reported to be short of funcjs ; he is, therefore, desirous of seeing LitvinofF personally in order to obtain more money and to explain to him how matters stand in Sweden. The Danish authorities were not, at the end of last month, inclined to grant him a visa.It is reported that Stockholm is to be used as a centre for distribution of jewellery to other European countries for the purpose of Bolshevik propaganda. The fall in the price of jewels in many centres is having an adverse effect on such methods of finance.The Return of Swedish Workmen from Russia.Swedish workmen who were drawn to Russia by the allurements of the. Soviet Authorities are now returning with a disgust as great as that of our own refugees at the conditions of labour there. These workers were tempted by the offer of enormous wages and other worthless promises, the impossibility of whose fulfilment it has only taken time to prove. To all appearance the recruiting of Swedish workmen to settle in Russia has ended in failure.LomonosofPs Appointment to Stockholm.The appointment of the Bolshevik Commissar, Lomonosoff, to Stock-holm as official representative of the Commissariat of Foreign Trade, and his arrival there before Litvinoff, whose appointment to Stockholm in a political capacity is somehow being delayed, has caused much heartburning between the latter and Krassin, Lomonosoffs official chief, LitvinofF is madly suspicious that it is another encroachment by Krassin on the political authority abroad of which he maintains that he is the sole repository. Litvinoff believes that Lomonosoff, as Krassin&apos;s agent, may be conspiring against him, and cannot bear to have the man out of his sight. This &quot; manie de la persecution &quot; on LitvinofPs part is becoming, almost ponderable, and may end, if suitable situations for it can be created, in making it impossible for his colleagues to work with him.DENMARK.The Clearing House.The International Clearing House at Copenhagen for trade with Soviet Russia has not been a success. The Danish Government disavowed any official connection with the enterprise. Gold to the amount of several million roubles was deposited in the Danish National Bank as a security for the exchange of goods. Early in July, however, Litvinoff was informed by Mr. Martin Larseu, of Sir Martin Abrahamsen&apos;s company, that as long as the general situation was not cleared up it was quite impossible for the Clearing House to do business, as they were unable to obtain credit from the banks, which had been instructed from England. In fact, the gold deposited failed to secure the credit required and the whole affair was a complete disappointment to the Soviet authorities.Litvinoff.Strom,  Hoeglund, Grimluud and Schliapnikoff  recently visited Litvinoff at Copenhagen.   They discussed the question of the Scandina-vian representatives for the Third International Conference at Moscow.. Litvinoff did not approve of the delegates that had been appointed, and arranged with Strom to send Christensen and Hellberg as the Danish
representatives ; Grimlund, Strom, Norre Turmann and Carlesson as the Swedish delegates, and Scheflo, Tranmael, Jacobsen, Friis and Wull as the Norwegian delegates. Litvinoff is not pleased with the money spent in Sweden and Denmark for Bolshevik propaganda, but he is of opinion that Bolshevism is developing successfully in Norway, owing to that country&apos;s communication Avith Murmansk. Propaganda schools are to be started in Murmansk, and Strom has received orders from Litvinoff to arrange for Scandinavian pupils to receive instruction in propaganda work,A new telegraph agency has been set up in Copenhagen called the &quot; Mediterranean-Baltic News Agency.&quot; This exchange also contem-plates opening up offices in Rome, Berlin, Warsaw, Kovno and Libau. It has a capital of 25,000/. sterling aud is under the direction of an Italian journalist, Giuontini. Giuontini, formerly a Hungarian subject, is thought to have pro-German leanings, and is believed to be in touch with the German Foreign Office.It is. not improbable, therefore, that the Exchange will be used for purposes of German propaganda.It is reliably reported that Germany has delivered considerable quantities of coal to Denmark. In this connection it is rumoured that an agreement exists between the Danish Social Democrats and the German Government.The Germans.Carl Hansen, secretary to the International Seamen&apos;s Federation, who has recently been to Denmark to inquire into the seamen&apos;s strike, stated in a conversation that he felt perfectly convinced, though he had not so far been able to obtain definite proofs, that the Danish seamen&apos;s strike had been engineered from Germany, and that Hugo Stinnes in all probability was behind the scheme. Stinnes intends supporting the strike movement so as to improve trade on Hamburg at the expense of Copenhagen.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HOLLAND.The Western Bureau of the Third International.Evidence of the maintenance of underground activities by the Amsterdam Bureau of the Third International appears in the concern shown by the Socialist Party of Ireland at a publication entitled &quot; The Political and Working Class Organisation in Ireland,&quot; which is surmised to have been circulated by that Bureau.The leaders of the Irish movement denounce the document in question as hopelessly inaccurate as regards the activities both of the Irish Socialist Party and of the Sinn Feiners. They warn comrades in all countries against its contents, which they quite falsely describe as a &quot;plant&quot; by the British Authorities. The Irish Socialist Party has written a reply which it is endeavouring to get published in extremist organs abroad.Split in the Communist Party.From an article which appeared in the June number of &quot; Le Phare &quot; it is clear that a split has occurred in the Dutch Communist Party. This split has been accentuated since the Conference of the Third International in February. Dr. Gorter, a prominent Dutch Com-munist, appears recently to have published an extremely violent articleB2
entitled &quot;The Unity of the International Proletariat,&quot; in which he accused the Dutch Communist leaders, Wynkoop and Van Ravensteyn, of making much of German Imperialism, while not seriously attacking that of the Entente ; of opportunism as regards the Versailles Treaty ; and of having, like Longuet and Kautsky, betrayed Socialism. In consequence, Mrs. Roland Hoist, Dr. Gorter, and Anton Pannekoek have severed their connection with the Party and now work in opposition to Wynkoop and his associates. Though many members of the Communist Party are said to regard these criticisms as valid, Wynkoop and Ravensteyn will probably maintain their positions. Dissension among their leaders and dissatis-faction in the ranks is said to have led to a marked decrease during the last two months in the number of the Communists in Holland. In some places extremist organisations have been entirely dissolved. The Dutch Authorities are said no longer to consider the Party as a menace to the country, and at its recent meeting at Amsterdau on 10th June the Com-inunist Party confessed that action on the part of the working classes had no chance as it was immediately crushed, and that they must fall back upon a period of propaganda by the intellectuals.The Anti-Revolutionary Bill.This Bill, which recently passed the Dutch Second Chamber contains measures destined to combat all revolutionary preparations, and particularly to prevent all importations of money or precious stones which may be used for Bolshevist propaganda in Holland, Punishment for infringement of any of the clauses of the Bill may entail anything up to five years&apos; penal servitude with or without a fine..The Minister of Justice, in supporting the Bill in the Chamber, stated that the Social Democratic Labour Party in Holland was acting as nothing more than a cover under which the Communists were working for the realisation of their ambitions, and warned the leader of that party, M. Troelstra, whose policy it has been to play fast and loose with the Communists, that the sure consequence of a revolution brought about by him would be his forced abdication to the Communists under Wynkoop.The opposition to the anti-Revolutionary law in Holland was not long-lived. Dutch workmen are becoming tired of strikes, and in several cases have acted against the advice of their leaders. The rapprochement between the various revolutionary sections and the Social Democrats was only a last attempt on the part of the extremists to impress their followers with the solidarity of the different revolutionary elements.Communists.Two Russians were recently captured by the Dutch Police in the act of. crossing the Belgian frontier into Holland, near Mrs. Roland Holsfs estate. They had no papers and were carrying some delicate machinery believed to be intended for the manufacturing of forged notes. It is reliably reported that the Soviet Government has been sending diamonds and other valuables ito Rotterdam and Amsterdam. The Dutch Com-munists also are stated to have received 50.000 Swedish crowns recently from Moscow and to have been promised further subsidies. France was likewise to receive her share as soon as a safe route could be discovered for the courier.&quot; The Tribune,&quot; the Dutch extremist paper, is 16,000 florins &quot;in debt. Mrs. Roland Hoist, who is known to be very wealthy, only contributes small amounts to the upkeep of this publication; apart from this it is not known how the journal obtains its funds. ;&quot;.;&quot;. Wynkoop, Kreiyt, van Leuven,&apos; and Dr. Ligt have all gone to Moscow via, Christiania to join the International Conference of the Dutch7
GERMANY.Negotiations and Trade and Industrial Relations with Soviet Russia.Before Kopp, the Soviet Governments late representative at Berlin, Avas withdrawn, he approached Dr., Koester, former German Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the question of peace negotiations between Germany and Soviet Russia. Dr. Koester replied that German action would depend entirely on the course of the present negotiations betAveen Great Britain and Russia, and that he did not then consider that peace would result from the negotiations in London. According to an informant who is in close touch both with Victor Kopp and well-knoAvn German commercial magnates, the latter agreed that nothing could be done as regards trade betAveen Germany and Soviet Russia until Krassin had completed his mission to England.Victor Kopp, when in Berlin, had a special safe at the Deutsche Bank where he kept all his gold, platinum, and jewels. His assistant Blum Avas reputed late in June to be making large purchases of agricultural implements and machinery.The German-Russian Trade Exchange Co-operative Society has been formed to supply Russia with machinery of all kinds and railway material at a low cost. The Co-operative Societies of the Ukraine have also been in touch with the German-Russian Trade Exchange Co-operative Society and have come to an agreement by which Germany is to deliver manu-factured articles to the Ukraine, which in return will supply Germany with raw materials.A German Government Mission headed by Herr Felix Deutsch, the leading figure in the Allgemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft, Avas announced as proceeding, to Soviet Russia early in July to study the economic situation. The mission also included Dr. Hollman, former Agricultural Expert to the German Consulate at Petrograd. It is not improbable that this delegation will investigate the schemes for the application of electrical power to agriculture dealt with in Part II. of this issue.No confirmation has been obtained by Government services of the . agreement betAveen the Bolsheviks and the German Government con-cerning Poland, which appeared in the &quot; Times &quot; of 5th August, and by which Poland Avas to be stripped clean of all food and other supplies by the Reds, and then handed OArer to Germany as security for consignments of agricultural and other machinery to be sent by Germany to Soviet Russia.Emigration of German Workmen to Soviet Russia.An association known -as the German-Russian Industrial Trade Association has been formed to place German skilled workmen and communist Party. The Dutch Government is reported to have Warned the Norwegian police that it contemplates issuing a sentence of banish-ment against Wynkoop, who will probably attempt to return to Holland via Norway.Miscellaneous.The Bureau of the International Federation&apos; of Police Officers at Amsterdam organised a Conference to take place during the third or fourth week in July. Delegates from England, Belgium, , France, Greece, and Italy were to attend.The anti-Militarist Conference which was to have been held at the Hague at the end of July has been indefinitely postponed.
organisers at the disposal of the Russian Soviet Government for the reconstruction of Russian industry. It is also prepared to provide Russia with workmen, provided these are allowed to remain as a unit and work under the direction of the association, which desires to establish a bureau in Moscow with the co-operation of the Russian Trade Associations. Two hundred German artisans, chiefly metal workers and men skilled in the building trade, have left Reval for Soviet Russia, where they will be employed in railway works near Moscow.Reactionaries.Reactionaries in Germany alternately cry out against Bolshevism as a fell disease and regard it philosophically as an epidemic through which all nations more or less will have to pass. The reactionary view is that when it has come to Germany and Germany has thrown it off she will return to some form of royalty and, the Right Extremists of course say, to the old Hohenzollern regime. The fear of this reversion has, in any case, been strong enough to cause the German Majority Socialists, Independent Socialists, and Communists to unite in an agreement, each party undertaking to give the other information regarding the activities of the reactionaries. At a special meeting of German Ministers, Herr David said he was in possession of a document which appealed to all Russian officers and men now in Germany to join the German readiness-tionary force and, if necessary, to go to Russia, with whom an alliance would shortly be made. That some such agreement has been evolved appears from a letter written by the Swiss Communist Platten before his return to his own country and subsequent arrest. Platten, writing from Russia, urges the Swiss Communists to work with their German comrades, and promises financial assistance and agitators from Russia. He.advises the Swiss comrades to get into touch with the members of the German Monarchist Party in Switzerland, as that party has already arrived at a practical working arrangement with the Russian Soviet Government.Russian Anti-Bolsheviks in Germany.According to Count Taube, the chief of the Russian Anti-Bolsheviks in Germany, there are two main parties working for the &quot; rejuvenation &quot; of Russia. There is the party of Savinkoff in Paris, which is supported by Nabokoff, Miljukoff, and Gutschkoff, the leaders of the former Cadet Party, and there is Taube&apos;s own party in Germany, to which Markoff, Prince Obolenski, von Romer, and von Berg adhere. Miljukoff and Nabokoff, of Savinkoff s party, visited Berlin late in May to reorganise the Cadet Party there, and to influence prisoners of war and emigrants in the sense of their policy.Taube&apos;s group works in with Bermondt and Wrangel, and aspires eventually to raise an army in the Baltic States to go to the help of such districts as Pskov, Novgorod, Witebsk, Smolensk, and Mohiloff, where White organisations are believed to exist. Savinkoffs group is said to be supported by the French as a set off against British and German influence, and generally in furtherance of French policy for Poland. It is, however, in general agreement with Taube for action against the Bolsheviks. Taube thinks Bermondt is a genuine anti-Bolshevik and a good leader, and attributes his failure at Riga to private German schemes. If Bermpndt could find sufficient men and obtain the needful support he is said to contemplate operations in the neigh-bourhood of Dvinsk. When, late in May, he was in Berlin there was .reason to believe that. he... was working with von der Gottz.   He stijl
keeps in touch with his former officers and started to pay their salaries again from the 1st of June, while he is also reported to have offered employment to Russian and German officers other than his own. As to Count Taube, while not anxious to combine with SavinkofFs French group, he is reported to be ready to do so if he comes to the conclusion that it is in the interests of Russia.Skoropadski, who was Ataman of the Ukraine during the German occupation, was reported early in June to be in Bavaria attempting to organise a Russian force to give aid to Poland. He then hoped to obtain the support of Russian aud also of Hungarian troops.Independent Socialists.The Executive Committee of the Third International has offered to &apos; allow the German Independent Socialists to attend the Moscow Interna-tioual Conference, which is to take place during this month, on condition that they unite with the Spartacists. This condition has been refused, but it seems probable that the delegates of the German Independents will hold a watching brief at the Conference.Despite the coldness with which it is regarded by the Third Inter-national, the German Independent Socialist Party is making friendly advances to Soviet Russia. Russia would like either to split the German Independent Socialist Party or combine it with the Spartacus League. There are signs that these two parties are trying to adapt themselves to one another by mutual concession. Broadly speaking, the Spartacus League constitutes the main driving force, the Independent Socialist Party accepting many of its views, while at the same time trying to round off their asperities.Economic.German export trade at the moment is reported to be greater than that of any other country in the world. Certain factories in Germany are being run under British management, German and Austrian labour being employed, and the raw materials coming from England. All the German banks have declared large dividends this year, and many of them have increased their capital. The same is reported of other big institutions in Germany, such as the Allgemeine Elektricitats-Gesell-schaft, which is making great efforts to get into closer touch with American business circles and to revive the American market in favour of German industrial enterprise.Information has been received, but not verified, that a British syndicate is being formed to buy from the British Government the German mercantile ships handed over in accordance with the Peace Treaty. These ships would be sold to a syndicate at Dantzig and kept under a neutral flag. The money for this syndicate would come from Germany, and Germans would then charter the vessels. A good deal of money is to pass to a certain Count Lucovich, who has been travelling frequently between Bremen and London, and is an attache at the German Embassy in this country.Goods purchased by Russia in Germany are being paid for in Romanoff roubles at an exchange of 56 pfennigs to the rouble. An arrangement apparently exists between the Reichsbank and the Soviet Government for the liquidation of these roubles by Russia in gold at the rate of 70 pfennigs to the rouble.An observer who has recently returned from the Rhineland Provinces states that the harvest this year promises to be exceptional, and that the . country, in general appears extremely prosperous.   In the cities there is i considerable scarcity of milk and other necessaries, which can only be : bought at an enormously enhanced price.
The Communists.&apos; In Extremist circles it is considered that matters in Germany will shortly come to a head ; first, because the future Government is&apos; bound eventually to get into the hands of the parties of the Right ; secondly, because of the annoyance of the working classes with the new taxes, which take 10 per cent, off their wages; and thirdly, because of the strike of agricultural labourers in Pomerania, which shows signs of spreading. The 10 per cent, tax on wages is causing great bitterness among the workers and is likely to lead to much trouble and unrest unless the Government modify or repeal it.A secret Communist International Congress was held in Berlin on the 12th June, representatives from Germany, Holland, Austria, Poland, Sweden and Soviet Russia being present. There were no repre-sentatives from England, but a message was sent from the headquarters of the Workers&apos; Friends Group of Anarchists in London, announcing its adhesion to the work of this secret conference.According to Wynkoop this group of Anarchists has been entrusted with special work by Lenin and has been responsible for the sendiug of arms to Ireland.The Conference in Berlin was still in progress on the 21st June, when the following programme was being discussed :  (1) Organisation of the Communist Secret Service, especially theCentral Secret Service in Soviet Russia. (2) The military situation in England, France and the United Statesof America.(3) The secret activities of prominent anti-Communist diplomats.(4) The organisation of a secret Press Propaganda Section with a view to placing Communists&apos; agents on the staffs of the more important newspapers in England, France, Germany and U.S.A.(5) Organisation of a Communist Black List Bureau for the purpose of contre-espionage.Schliapnikoff, the Bolshevik agent who has recently been in Berlin, returned to Copenhagen at the end of June and reported to Litvinoff that he had been unsuccessful in reorganising the German Trade Unions on a Communist basis. He also reported to Litvinoff on the recent Communist meeting which was held in Berlin in order to discuss the Communist failure at the general elections. Clara Zetkin attributed this failure to the fact that the working classes were tired of the incessant talk of the Communists to take up arms and create a reign of terror.A prominent member of the German Communist Party stated that the reason for that party&apos;s participation in the Reichstag elections was that their order to their followers to abstain from voting was not complied with in January 1919 ; they, therefore, wish to avoid their votes being given to other parties. Probably a general strike would precede any revolutionary movement from the Left. The Reds are well supplied with arms and ammunition. Four million rifles are unaccounted for and it is believed that many of these have found their way into the hands of the Spartacists from returned soldiers who sold them and through speculators who bought and looted them. In the event of disturbances the Reds would confine their operations to the towns and would avoid conclusions with the troops in open country. The situation is, however, at present unfavourable for a revolutionary movement from the Left, as the Workers&apos; Councils are not established on a proper communistic basis
and many of the workers do not favour a council system. It is true that the Red soldiers are prepared.to be called up at any time but many of their rifles have been taken away from them in the Ruhr District and are now in the hands of the reactionaries there and elsewhere, who are reported to be preparing to strengthen the new Government by military operations and have no intention of giving in to the Entente. The Com-mander-in-Chief of the Reichswehr claims that he had before Spa completely deceived the Entente Control Mission as regards arms which lay hidden in attics and cellars, and that voluntary and State organiza-tions, in fact militaristic, were flourishing more than ever.Nationalist Communist Party (K.A.P.D.).The prominent member of the German Communist Party, who has just been quoted, speaking of the Nationalist Communist Party, said that its Nationalist propaganda was the one great danger in the Avay of the party&apos;s desiring to establish a Soviet Government. He said that the Right were encouraging the Nationalist Communists because of principles already strongly attacked by the Communist Party proper and by Lenin. As an instance of the favour with which the authorities regard it, he quoted the &quot; Hamburger Arbeiter Zeitung,&quot; a paper run by Dr. Lauffenberg, the leader of the Nationalist Communist Party. This paper was allowed to appear when other Communist papers in Germany had been suppressed. Lauffenberg was known to be in relation with von Lettow-Vorbeck and other officers. The Nationalist Communist Party was turned out of the Communist Party about November 1919, but they took with them the control of the militancy of the party. Just before the Kapp Putsch they applied to Victor Kopp. He refused to help them because they had left the Communist Party, but it was finally arranged that he should help the Kampf organisation through the Western European Bureau, provided he could get that bureau to approve of its leaders. This was satisfactorily arranged and Kopp gave them 50,000 marks, which are said by this means to have got into the hands of the reactionaries. Litvinoff was appointed to inquire into Kopp&apos;s dealings in this matter.The German Nationalist Communist Party is trying to found a similar party in Czecho-Slovakia and has been sending agitators of its own particular brand of Communism across the border. The project is not approved of by the Social Democratic Party in that country, which believes in evolutionary methods and disapproves of agitation leading to deeds of violence.John de Kay and the League of Oppressed Peoples.The Society of Oppressed Peoples now working under John de Kay is believed to have been organised by the German Foreign Office for war purposes. Its most prominent men apart from its director are Professor Mittwoch, who is said to be the unofficial representative on it of the German Foreign Office ; Pillai, the Hindu ; and Colonel Emerson, who is Chief of the American Section. Small drafts of Germans, Swedes, Swiss, and others with a knowledge of Oriental languages have been sent on missions to Persia and Afghanistan. John de Kay has recently been reported to be contemplating the establishment of a slaughter-house in or near Budapest, and the story goes that he has collected 5,000,000 dollars of his own money and his friends&apos; to invest in the enterprise. It is definitely clear, however, that he is now in financial difficulties. He has been obliged to sell his motor car and was wondering, in June, whether he would have enough money to carry out his projected trip to Budapest.
SWITZERLAND.Bolshevik propadanda is reported not to be prospering in Switzerland, and Swiss Railway, Post, and Telegraph employees have taken little part in the International boycott movement against Hungary. Platten, the leading Swiss Communist, is out on bail, but was to be brought to trial on July 16th before a Court Martial, when he would be liable to at least six months&apos; imprisonment. The Swiss authorities consider that Platten&apos;s bolt is shot as far as Switzerland is concerned. Both his influence and his backing have diminished. A letter of his furnishing important documentary evidence regarding the collusion between the German Monarchists and the Russian Bolsheviks is quoted under the heading Germau Monarchists.The Agence &quot;Respublica &quot; in Berne, another pie in which John de Kay has a finger, is reported to be the centre for Irish propaganda in Switzerland. Hitherto this agency has confined itself to spreading only Socialism and Extremism in the Press. It now proposes to deal with Irish affairs and will doubtless become the official organ of 0&apos;Leary, formerly President of the Irish American Societies in New York, should there be any truth in the story that he is to take up a position at Berne as representative of the Irish Republic. 0&apos;Leary is stated to be about to develop a Press Telegraph Agency in Switzerland for the Irish Republic, in which he is to receive the assistance of John de Kay and Jean Debrit, the editor of &quot;La Feuille.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;La Feuille&quot; itself has failed as a daily but continues as a weekly. Its funds have, as far as is known, been derived up to the present from extremist and pro-German sources. John de Kay has also given it support, but there is evidence that he is now very short of money. 0&apos;Leary&apos;s money, if he comes and has it to spare, will be welcome.Humbert Droz, the Swiss Bolshevik, was reported at the end of June to be endeavouring to reach Moscow to attend a Conference of the Third International.An International Miners&apos; Conference, at which the Socialisation of mines, a six-hour day, International action on the part of the miners, and the establishment of a permanent International Council will be discussed, is to be held at Geneva at the beginning of August. Germany will be represented by 35 members belonging to four organisations, and a British Delegation of a dozen or 15, including Robert Smillie, James Winston, as well as other and milder exponents of extreme doctrines, will attend. The absence of these leaders will delay the ballot for a miners&apos; strike in England.AUSTRIA.Extremist circles in Austria consider it dangerous to take any revolu-tionary action at present, as an aggravation of the present state of chaos would naturally be put down to them. They think, however, that if Italy decides to come to terms with Soviet Russia, revolution in Austria may be possible with the co-operation of the Germans.At a Conference of the Austrian Workmen&apos;s Councils, which opened at Vienna on 1st June under the presidency of Dr. Friedrich Adler, a split occurred between the Communists and the Social Democrats. The principal accusation levelled against the Communists was that they had been engaged in an underhand agitation against the authority of the Councils and had made it impossible for the proletariat to face reaction with a united front. Dr. Friedlander, in repudiating these accusations, admitted that Dr. Otto Bauer was right in saying that as long as
Austria was dependent on the goodwill of foreign Powers experiments in the dictatorship of the proletariat would merely end in famine.At an International Communist Congress in April last at Milan, the liquidation of the Austrian Communist Bureau under Karl Toman, and its absorption by the Stockholm office, was announced. It was then proposed that the latter should take the place of the Western Secretariat.The Viennese Authorities learnt in May that the official Wireless Bureau in Vienna was being used for communication with Soviet Russia and dismissed several of the officials implicated.HUNGARY.At a meeting at Brussels on 6th July of the International Federation of Trades Unions it was decided to continue and, if possible, to intensify the boycott against Hungary. According to Huszar, the ex-Hungariau Prime Minister, tin) boycott will not, however, affect the food situation in the country; the harvest has been ripe for some time, and it is probable that the sufferers from the boycott will be the countries surrounding Hungary, to which no wheat will be exported.The boycott is the cause generally assigned by the Socialist and Extremist Press for the resignation of the Hungarian Cabinet in June ; a truer reason, however, would appear to have been the change in the Parliamentary situation caused by the result of the elections in the districts beyond the Theiss.The Ungarische Bank und Handels Aktieu-Gesellschaft has recently increased its capital by 100,000,000 kronen, half locally and half by an . English group. The Managing Director of this Bank in Hungary, one Dimon Krausz, was suspected during the war of having pro-Bolshevik sympathies.A Hungarian Communist, called Bela Horty, has recently arrived at Copenhagen on a false American passport, with the sum of kr. 1,500,000, which he intends to use for propaganda amongst the Syndicalists. He intends to come to. England, but will be refused a landing.CZECH0-SL0VAKIA. Its Intermediate Situation.The danger which is apprehended in the juncture through northern Poland of East Prussia and Soviet Russia has its counterpart in Czecho-Slovakia, where the coincidence of German commercial and economic favour with the much reported friendship for Soviet Russia in high quarters is too remarkable not to catch the eye.In Czecho-Slovak official circles which remain sound the Bolshevik menace is regarded as serious, Suspicion falls upon the Ministry of the Interior, which is already known to have had dealings with M. Karolyi during his stay at Prague. The military are to be considered very unreliable. A good many of the troops who have recently returned from Russia have distinctly Communist tendencies. Of the police, also, .it is rumoured that in the event of a Soviet Government being proclaimed about one-fourth would go over to the Bolsheviks.j A good deal of money is said to be passing between the Communists in Czecho-Slovakia and Vienna and a considerable Bolshevik organisation .is reported at Rutscharik in Czecho-Slovakia to be organising under the leadership of Preobajenski in close touch with Prague. The Prague ;;newspaper, &quot; Golos Narold &quot; is supported by the Soviet Government.
On the other hand, German activity in all branches of industry in Czecho-slovakia is very tense and everything points to closer economic ties between the two countries. In April Dr. Schuster went to Berlin&apos; with a Commission and a provisional treaty for the establishment of. economic relations between Germany and Czecho-slovakia, whereby Germany receives various raw materials from Czecho-slovakia and gives coal in exchange was the result.Communists.Unrest in the Kladno district in May was attributed to the activities of the Communists amongst the State railway employees and the large factories. A certain Ignatz Mittelbach and bis right-hand man, E. Schuster, were active in addressing meetings and stirring up trouble while maintaining close touch with their comrades in Saxony. It was reliably reported during the last month that a courier of the Czech Bolsheviks returned to his own country with five million dollars, two million of which were given to the Austrian comrades.The Communists in South Bohemia, acting under the leadership of Mueller, are trying to unite all sections of extremists in that region and will formulate a programme after the example of the Marxists of the Left and of the Social Democratic Party.Socialists.There has been a split in the Social Democratic Party resulting in the formation of an Independent Social Democratic Party, 50 per cent, of which are Communists and 50 per cent. Social Democrats. Referring to the losses of the National Socialist Party at the recent elections, Cervinka, a prominent member of the Party, said that he and possibly the Moravian Party as a whole, would adhere to the Communist Group now in procoss of formation in Moravia.4. RUSSIA AND BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.Congress or the Third International.The Congress of the Third International, which met in Moscow in July, Avas attended by British, Russian, American; Hungarian, Polish, Austrian and Dutch delegates. The arrangement was that the delegates to the Congress Avere to be provided for gratis in Moscoav, but that they Avould have to pay their expenses as far as Christiania. Two French Socialists, MM. Cachin and Frossard, held a Watching brief for their party, which has decided to sever its connection with the Second International and is considering the advisability of entering the Third. The chief point of discussion was the Third InternationaPs world policy as regards revolutionary agitation and propaganda.A smaller Congress of the Third International held in Italy during April agreed that Russia should resume trade relations with the Entente and ostensibly give up the idea of world revolution, but that the propa-ganda work of-the Third International should be carried on underground and an International Soviet Council should be founded in which all countries should be represented. This International Council was to be founded ao soon as the Entente and Russia came to an agreement. Between the policy propounded in Italy and what we know of the Moscow decisions there is an undoubted agreement.   Bukharin, speaking
on the Communist Party and the parliamentary system, indicated that there were two phases of the position of the Communist Party : (1) Under peaceful conditions, when the proletariat had to a certain extent common interests with capitalism, and when the Socialists as a party must strive to acquire importance in Parliament :(2) Under militant conditions, when the civil war had begun and the Socialist faction was converted into a weapon for the destruction of Parliament. He accused all factions in the present European Parliaments of too great a tendency to compromise. The guarantee of the revolutionary use of Parliament Avould be the creation of a Communist faction, cleared of compromising elements. Such a faction would become a real weapon for the destruction of Parliament.Lenin afterwards spoke in much the same tone. After Bordiga had proposed the opposition thesis and William Gallagher had supported him, emphasising the need to prepare for mass action and not to waste time on Parliament, Murphy had pleaded for the inclusion of Communists in Parliament on the ground that their absence made the industrial struggle difficult, strikers having no information until too late.Lenin then spoke as follows : He said, &quot; We cannot fight &quot; in the vway we please.   We must use the conditions we &quot; have. . The mass of workers and  peasants believe in &quot; Parliament, and we need to use it to show its futility for &quot; revolution.   If we must work with reactionaries in trade &quot; unions, why be afraid of work in Parliament? We must &quot; convince the workers by experience.   We cannot by theories. &quot; We cannot devise new ways of revolutionary action, but must &quot; use the ways provided by historical development.&quot; ,   i Bukhara! ended the sederunt on August 2nd by insisting that the anti-Parliamentarians bad a case so Weak that they had to bring forward unsuitable j^uments, and the thesis that parliamentary action should be adopted as part of the Communist programme in all countries was passed by a large majority.There is no need to draw attention to the bitter paradox of Lenin about the use of Parliament. Speaking on the same subject a day or two earlier, he said he considered that any other policy than that which was bound up with terror and violence was unthinkable. The dictatorship of the proletariat was unthinkable without terror and violence against the deadliest enemies of the proletariat and the working masses. No matter what the situation was, they must carry on a struggle against them and the revolutionary situation would probably be still sharper before the revolutionary wave subsided.Cachin and Frossard, the two French Socialists, promised, on their return to France, to advise their party to adhere to the Third Inter-national.The Question of Exports.Information derived from what is competently described as a reliable source tends to show that there is little hope of obtaining raw materials or manufactured articles from Soviet Russia for many years to come. The informant, who is well vouched for as possessing a wide knowledge of Soviet Russia and who recently returned from that country, on being asked what the future prospects of exports were, stated :-   &quot;&quot; As compared with what Russia needs from the West, she can offer but little for export in return.   Of raw products only flax-,
bristles and furs can be exported. One would think that there would be a large quantity of flax available for export since none has been exported for several years. On the other hand, however, the acreage given over to flax has very materially decreased of recent years and this is, of course, true of all other agricultural products grown for further manufacturing process and not for consumption as food. Further, according to Rykov, in spite of premiums offered by the Government for the delivery of flax, the organisation for the collecting of flax by the Government institutions has met with but little success. There is probably a fairly large quantity of flax on hand in Petrograd. Several steamers left with flax for Germany in the fall of 1918. The flax was exchanged for coal and pre-war prices were used as a basis in the exchange. No timber is available for export owing to (1) the scarcity of timber in all markets in the interior of Russia at the present time ; (2) the great difficulties encountered at present in the prosecution of the lumber industry in Russia ; and (3) the season during which the lumber can be floated down the streams from the camps has passed.&quot; Owing to the lack of articles for export, Russia will un-doubtedly offer trade concessions for foreign goods. The Commis-sion for Foreign Trade at the Supreme Economic Conference (is preparing and will publish a list of important proposed concessions for construction work. Among others, the following will be included: The Volga-Don Channel, the Perekop Channel, and concessions for the exploitation of natural resources in Turkestan, Caucasus, and Siberia.*&quot; Grain will not be an important article of export trade for some years on account of the difficulties of inland transportation, the agrarian policy of the Soviet Government, and. the fact that the peasant has lost all desire or ambition to plant more than he needs for himself and family. Until recently Russian foreign trade has had the peculiar aspect of contraband trade organised by the Government. The Commissariat of Foreign Trade had its own agents on all borders who financed those dealings in contraband and purchased all their goods, mostly medicines, colours, &amp;c. No important results were achieved, however, and about Easter time all of these agents were recalled.&quot;Many offers haye been received by the Commissariat of Foreign Trade from practically all&apos; foreign countries, but the majority of these offers were made by firms of questionable standing and reliability, and contracts were not concluded.&quot;As regards grain, it must be confessed that all reports, with the exception of one regarding South Russia and the Kuban Province, dated October 1919, and therefore over a year old, a report, moreover, which inevitably failed to allow for the subsequent months during which it has been necessary to feed the Red Armies and the starving towns, strongly corroborate the above conclusions. Quite recently the Soviet Govern ment have succeeded in despatching from South Russian ports to Italy a quantity of grain. That quantity is only one-third of the amount promised by Krassin to the Italian Government, and Litvinoff, who rejoices in any set-back for Krassin or his trade experts, has been exulting over this failure.* It is thought that one of these concessions may be that mentioned in the article on the electrification of agriculture in Part 2 of this issue,
30Again, reports from Germany, the Ukraine, North Russia, and Moscow concur as regards the futility of expecting foodstuffs in any quantity. A leading bank director in close touch with the German Government affirms that no good for Germany can for the present be expected to come of trade with Soviet Russia. A certain amount of corn, according to this authority, exists-in the Government of Simbirsk and further East, but owing to the breakdown of transport it would be impossible to get these supplies into Germany.   .An informant who has returned fromKieff since its occupation by the Poles, describes the economic destitution of the Ukraine, and says the factories are idle, and the rich, corn-producing soil is lying uncultivated, and that the state of the roads is such as to render transportation impossible.As regards Northern Russia again, a representative of Hudson Bay North Russian Trading Company, who has recently made a careful investigation of the situation there from a trading point of view, says that the only articles available for export are paints, skins, furs, and a very limited quantity of minerals, flax, and wood.An informant who has recently returned from Moscow says : &quot; People &quot; talk of stocks of grain existing in Russia, and, of course, the absence &quot; of statistics there makes it very difficult to estimate the actual &quot; supplies held by the peasants. It is common knowledge, however, &quot; that the peasants in order to avoid their stocks being requisitioned by &apos;&apos; the Bolsheviks have only sown enough for their own requirements.It is exceedingly doubtful if there is a sufficient supply of grain in &quot; Russia to warrant it being called one of the riches of the peasantry.&quot;At a Congress of the All Russian Central Executive Committee held in Moscow on July 1st, a decree was issued stating that it would only be possible to supply the Red Array, transport and industrial workers, and the labouring population with foodstuffs on condition of participation of all State organisations in the work of storing food supplies. The inference from this is obviously that no stocks of foodstuffs are available for export.Again, a statement regarding the transport situation, which appeared in the Bulletin of the Intelligence Department of the Communist Inter-national in March, estimated that the time required to make the railway service in Russia efficient would be 27 years at the present rate of output in Government establishments.The prospect,- therefore, with regard to the export of foodstuffs would appear to be anything but bright.The Peasants and the Land.The extreme theorists of the Soviet Government seem to have been brought to their senses about the attitude of the peasantry. In June, in an interview with M. Jacob Friis, the Norwegian Communist leader, Lenin complained bitterly of the difficulties of getting the peasants to accept the ideas of Communism, and said that their egoism must be broken, even should it be necessary to use the army to do it. &quot; The time has come,&quot; he said, &quot; when the peasant must be brought to reason &quot; (i.e., to agree and act in accordance with Communist principles).From a manifesto issued in Moscow on July 13th, entitled &quot; The Week of the Peasant for the Reconstruction of the Countryside,&quot; it is clear that the Bolshevik authorities were adopting measures not quite so drastic. The manifesto promises the peasantry special aid in the shape of agricultural machinery and labour for the cultivation of the land belonging to the Red Army men fighting against Poland. A deputation of. Central.Russian peasants had. gone to see Lenin on the subject of
peace with Poland, complaining that they could not subsist at all if men were taken away from the farms to serve in the army and if their live-stock continued to be requisitioned. Lenin&apos;s reply to them was concilia-tory. He asked them to remain quiet a little longer, but pointed out that it was their sons who has forced G-reat Britain to negotiate with Russia. &quot; British and French comrades,&quot; he said, &quot; are doing all they can to bring about peace with Russia.&quot; The deputation were not impressed with the answer, and said, very sensibly, that for 200 years the ruling powers had promised them peace, but that there had been nothing but war.The latest cure for the ills of the peasant appears to be the despatch to the country towns and villages of contingents of town workers, un-employed owing to the closing of works and factories. The result, as far as one can see, Avill be that the town workers will stay. The return to the land is, in Russia, a reversion to type. The Soviet Government, by sending workmen to the fields, is probably adding to the &quot;solid barrier in the way of Communism, which, paradoxical as it may at present seem, the population of Russia really constitutes.A serious peasant revolt occurred late in May in the district of Tiraspol, Bessarabia. The Soviet authorities put down the rising in their usual merciless manner, carrying out many executions and reducing the town to ruin.According to Moscow Wireless a fine of .one million roubles was imposed on the population of a certain village district as a punishment for damage deliberately done to vehicles required for the needs of the army and for disloyalty in carrying out Soviet orders.1 An informant who has recently returned from Moscow is of the opinion that the peasantry will revolt if heavy requisitions continue to be made for the starving towns and the Red Armies. He does not think, j however, that they would rise merely for democratic aims or, indeed, for any political idea. That would be to expect too much of the Russian peasant, who for many years to come must be expected to bear every-thing but the absolutely unbearable, and who is probably as incapable of accepting the ideas of Democracy as he is unresponsive to the propaganda of Communism.Propaganda abroad.Towards the end of May the Soviet authorities, perceiving that with the return of the foreign refugees to their respective countries too much of the truth about the failure of the Soviet regime to set up in Russia even the elements of an ordered polity was bound to become known, decided that the time had come to extenuate nothing and to explain everything in terms of the blockade and of foreign intervention. Orders were accordingly issued that the British delegates visiting Soviet Russia were to be shown the economic effects of Bolshevism in their true light, but that the disastrous state of affairs displayed was to be put down to the policy of the Entente in enforcing the blockade and in giving aid and comfort to the Russian reactionary armies. Simul-taneously Bolshevik wireless propaganda was directed towards a campaign against England, which was held responsible for the internal conditions of Russia, as well as for the Polish offensive. Early in June, in order to calm the effect of his propaganda abroad, Tchitcherin announced to all the world by wireless from Moscow that intervention in the internal affairs of foreign States on the part of Soviet representa-iives in foreign countries was forbidden. The Soviet representative in Berlin was instructed to refrain from taking any part in Germany&apos;s home policy. Apart from the implied admission on the part of the Bolsheviks which such an announcement constituted that their representatives in
foreign countries had been engaged in political propaganda in the past, the lack of correspondence between the instructions given with what is known to have followed is an obvious proof of insincerity.Early in July Tchitcherin, speaking to a foreign journalist, laid stress on the Soviet Governments anxiety to meet the wishes of foreign countries which imposed as a condition of their recognition of the Soviet Government that Communistic propaganda should cease ; but he added that, as to the activities of the Third International, he could not give any guarantee that its members abroad would be bound by such con-tracts, and, should they think fit to continue such propaganda, the Soviet Government would be powerless to stop them. In other words, his pious declaration of an abstention from interference in the affairs of foreign countries constituted a mere formal shifting of the responsibility for a world-wide Communist propaganda on to the shoulders of an international body, constantly relying upon and inspired by Soviet Russia itself. Meanwhile, Nogin, one of the Soviet Trade Delegates in London, stated, in a letter despatched (from the Central Bolshevik Com-mittee in Stockholm to the Council of Popular Economics, that the &quot; Hands-off-Russia&quot; movement in Great Britain had adopted the Soviet programme and would, in the near future, be subsidised by the Bolshevik Government, a prediction which he was competent to make, seeing that he was himself, after his arrival in England, reliably reported to be subsidising it.Bolshevik propaganda in England soon became more ambitious. Shortly after the arrival of the Krassin Delegation, on June 9th, to be precise, there was a luncheon party at Frascati&apos;s, at which George Lansbury, Francis Meynell, and other representatives of the &quot; Daily Herald&quot; entertained members of the Delegation. The subsequent trend of events has made it pretty clear, that the &quot; Herald&quot; at this luncheon approached the delegation with a view to obtaining a subsidy from the Bolshevik Government. The &quot; Herald &quot; is known to be in low water, and Lansbury, when he was in Russia,&quot; was obliged to approach the Soviet Government for the delivery of paper to carry it on.It appears that the delegates, who had then newly arrived, and were much impressed by the promises not to intermeddle with politics which had been exacted from them, and who were impressed also, in a greater degree, perhaps, than was really necessary, with the power of the police in this country, rejected the overtures of the &quot; Herald&quot; group. Shortly afterwards, however, Francis Meynell applied for a passport to Scandinavian countries, and is known to have seen Litvinoff. His visit was followed by a subsidy of 50,000 francs monthly for six months to the &quot; Herald&quot; from the Soviet Government; this subsidy to be sent through Litvinoff to the members of the delegation in England.The delegation by this time, finding that nothing very dreadful had happened to them, had grown more daring, and ventured to enter into the relations with the &quot; Herald &quot; which its members had at first deprecated. This has been amply proved by the appearance in the &quot; Herald &quot; before all other newspapers of communications by the Soviet Government, most notably of all by the appearance in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; of July 22nd of the full text of the Soviet Governments reply to the Allied Note of July 12th which Mr. Lloyd George declined to give in Parliament the - night before. The Russian Delegation, however, appear to have felt it safer to communicate Soviet Government news to the &quot; Herald &quot; than to deliver money from hand to hand. For this purpose they appointed an intermediary, one Mozart, who was to receive the money from the 0 11837 0
delegation and to deliver it to Francis Meynell. It has now boon pretty conclusively proved that this Mozart is no other than Theodore Rothstein, and that the name Mozart is an anagram of the Yiddish Dmsart^ Red-stone = German: Rothstcin. It is known Francis Meynell has already received a sum on account of the subsidies and the Soviet Government have now realised certain Chinese bonds, held by the Imperial Treasury under the old regime, in order to continue the subsidy for six months as they had arranged.Only two conclusions can be drawn from the whole affair. First, that the Russian Delegates have broken their solemn pledge, given on entering Great Britain, not to undertake propaganda or meddle with the politics of the country; second, that the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is now the official and subsidised organ in this country of the Soviet Government and has knowingly abetted the members of the delegation in the violation of their pledge.Internal Propaganda,A Moscow Wireless makes it clear that the Bolsheviks still hope to use propaganda with effect in Russia itself. During May, it is stated that in the Moscow district 1,770 columns of troops and over 1,000,000 Red Army men were supplied with literature circulated from 62 agitation points. 46,000 Moscow newspapers and 100,000 local newspapers were distributed; 100,000 news placards were posted up, 400 meetings arranged and 12,000 &quot; Biessedy,&quot; or informal chats. Further agitation centres were, announced as in course of establishment not only in large towns, but also at railway stations, together with many concerts, lectures and cinematograph seances all over the country.All the paper in Russia is being used for propaganda purposes and M. Gorky, who is in charge of the Department of the World&apos;s Literature, has been obliged to send his representatives &quot;abroad for millions of translations and lesson books of well-known foreign authors, as well as for the printing of the Russian classics in old Russian characters for consumption abroad.Oriental Policy.The Oriental policy of the Soviet Government suffers from the fundamental dualism which invalidates its Foreign policy as a whole. This division is between what may shortly be denominated the Capitalist and actively Communist policies of Soviet Russia.The Capitalists&apos; view the policy of the business men has its representative in M. Krassin, who, convinced Marxist as he theoretically is, is still, as far as the immediate policy of Soviet Russia is concerned, the pro-German, the ally of Siemens-Schuckert, the big industrial seeking to throw open Russia to Central European, i.e., German, exploitation, and endeavouring by a truce with Britain to obtain that raising of the blockade, *that breathing space, which will secure the co-operation of German industry by the establishment of Russian credit.In opposition, and one might add, in venomous antipathy, to this policy and its representatives, stand Lenin and Litvinoff. The former is the single-minded theoretical revolutionary to whom war or bloodshed are as nothing in comparison with his theory, who will indeed concede parliamentary action, but only to demonstrate its futility, and as a paradoxical approach to the direct action which he alone values. Litvinoff, on the other hand, is the revolutionary adventurer who, really caring nothing for Communism, sees in its establishment by direct action and a continuous foreign propaganda tending to revolution in all capitalist States the road to his own political fortunes. The division in principle between the two groups is apparent in the attitude of the two parties to the policy of the British Government and Mr. Lloyd George.  In the
course of his early conwsations with Mr. Lloyd G-eorge, Krassin appears to have come to the conclusion that the British Government was well informed regarding the secret negotiations between Moscow and the Oriental countries and that the Prime Minister was in great fear of a Bolshevik offensive against Persia. British dismay, as they consider it, as regards the East led the two parties to very different conclusions, Krassin recommending the cessation of propaganda in the East, at any rate in name, while LitvinofF apparently opposed this view and held that the menace in the East should be exploited to the full in order to frighten Great Britain into entering into negotiations with Soviet Russia, and so to further his own admission to this country, whore he aspired to the post of Russian Ambassador. The policy of Litvinoff, however, to divide the Entente countries appears generally to entail a strong Bolshevik thrust to the East. A certain John Louuegren, a Swedish subject, notoriously pro-German during the war, was holding conferences late in May with Litvinoff on the Oriental situation and stated that it was now going to be dealt with seriously. He is believed thereafter to have left for Constantinople in pursuance of his plans. A German Professor, named Wittig, who recently visited Copenhagen, was of opinion that the Eastern policy of the Soviet Government would be carried out by any Russian Government, whether Bolshevik or anti-Bolshevik, and he further stated that should the Monarchists obtain power they would undoubtedly carry on the Bolsheviks&apos; Oriental policy as a defence against an attack by England upon the integrity of Russia. Professor Wittig rated the Bolshevik knowledge of the East high and stated that their leading men now engaged in Eastern propaganda had all formerly belonged to the old regime.The text of a Note addressed late in June by Tchitcherin to Mustafa Kemal Pasha is instructive as to Bolshevik intentions, though Mustafa Kemal&apos;s recent failure makes it improbable that it is of much actual value. The Soviet Government in this Note undertook to make war in con-junction with Mustafa Kemal Pasha&apos;s Government against foreign Imperialism ; recognised the independence of Turkey and the re-union of all real Turks in their territory ; recognised the independence of Arabia and Syria; gave Kurdestan, Lurestan &quot;and the Batum district to the Turkish Armenians; proposed that the question of the Dardanelles should be solved by conference with the Black Sea States ; proposed to annul all economic agreements and agreements regarding spheres of influence made by the Powers with Turkey; proposed to act as inter-intermediary between Turkey, Armenia and Persia on the frontier question ; and agreed to let Mustafa Keinal Pasha replace Bolshevik by Turkish and Persian troops should the former be withdrawn from Persia for tactical, political or other reasons.The Executive Committee of the Third International held a meeting on June 29th at Moscow, at which it was decided to appeal to the peoples of Armenia, Persia, and Turkey to join the insurgent workers and peasants of Europe, and particularly the Red Army, against Western Capitalism. A conference to decide upon further actioii in this respect is to be held in Baku on September 1st.Internal Affairs.The Soviet Governments Commissar of Finance declared in an interview towards the end of June that money must be done away with in Soviet Russia. He expressed the fervent hope that by next winter 1,000 roubles would not be worth one kopeck.According to Moscow Wireless, the People&apos;s Commissary for Finance has been entrusted with the cancelling of the numerous State and localo 2
taxes now in existence and with their replacement by a uniform direct tax. He is to introduce effective measures ensuring settlements in kind without cash transactions. As regards the distribution of currency the existing system is to be cancelled, and the distribution placed under the sole control of the People&apos;s Commissariat for Finance.A special conference is being held in Russia to decide a system of material rewards for the increased productive labour of the country. From the moment the remuneration system is confirmed no pecuniary or material rewards may be issued by any institution without the knowledge or consent of the Russian Soviet of Professional Unions.A new system of fixing tlu3 food ration in proportion to the amount of labour performed has been devised. Citizens are classified as (I) Workers in Soviet undertakings ; (2) Soviet employees; and (3) Workers who are not exploiting the labour of others. Rations will be issued for the actual working days, for legal rest days and for duly registered days of sickness. The proportion between working days and rest days is as four to three. This system was to come into operation on June 15th. It was not to include children. It is not astonishing in view of the working hours enforced under the Soviet regime that over-time is only authorised in case of extreme necessity, and that the consent of the Competent Union and of the Labour Inspectorate concerned have to be obtained. The maximum amount of overtime permissible is 50 hours per month, except when State interests demand it, when it must be sanctioned by the Central Council of the Trade Unions.The Krassin Mission.Before his departure for England in June, Krassin received a tele-gram from an American Chamber of Commerce to say that an American Mission desired to visit Europe to discuss business with him, and to get permission to proceed to Russia. Litvinoff, however, opposed the visit of this mission, saying that all Americans coming to Russia went there merely for purposes of espionage. Litvinoff still adheres to these ideas and has lately been recommending the prohibition of entry to Russia for certain travellers of the Ford firm.Active in promoting the visit of the American Mission to Russia was William Redfield, former Minister of Commerce, and the present President of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, who is known to be in touch with Martens. A company was registered in London early in June under the name of the All-Russian Co-Operative Society, Limited, for the purpose of conducting trade negotiations for the Centrosoyus, which is under the direct control of the Soviet Government. The directors of this concern are Dr. Madam Polovtsev, a Menshevik, M. Kryssin, whose political views are open to some suspicion, and Dr. Jockelman, a rather meddling Jew. The company approached the Hudson Bay Company with a project for an expedition to the Kara Sea, which was not favourably received.Before Krassin originally left Copenhagen for England he was concerned in some discussion of a loan to be raised by the Frankfurt bankers in conjunction with Siemens-Schuckert. No positive agreement had been arrived at, but the proposal was to be deferred until after the more important business of getting a connection with England had been achieved. Various protests were received in the early days of the mission, including one from the Ukrainian Mission in London, against Krassm&apos;s proposal to pay in gold for the concessions of the Ukrainian Government. The Ukraine argued that it had a claim to a proportionate share of the gold reserve of the Imperial Bank of Russia, and protested against its disposal by Krassin.   More recently a writ is reported to have
been served on the Soviet Trade Mission in London to secure the sequestration of its pooperty for the satisfaction of alleged creditors of the Soviet Government.General Wrangel.General Wrangel&apos;s recent successes appear in part to be due to his profiting by the mistakes of Denikiu and Koltchak. He has gained the support of the military party, but has also laid himself out to obtain the sympathy of the rural population, to whom he has guaranteed possession of the land and liberal agrarian reforms. The White Committee in Paris promised to support him on condition that he formulated a democratic programme for the security of the workmen and peasants and that he guaranteed the summoning of a National Assembly. Most of his ministers appear to be supporters of the Czarist regime. Prominent among these is Neratovv, the Russian diplomatic representative at Constantinople. Neratow, who is in constant touch with General Wrangel, is reported to be still imbued with the inherent old Russian distrust of Great Britain and to be surrounded by a group whose sympathies are avoAvedly pro-German.The Bolsheviks have been intriguing, as far as can be ascertained Avithout very great success, with the Crimean Tartars with a view to creating risings in the rear of General wrangel&apos;s army, in return for which the Soviet authorities are to recognise the independence of the Tartars.Victor Kopp.It is reliably reported by German Militarists and Bolsheviks that Kopp, who is going to Moscow, has with him very important technical aud political advice from the German Military authorities for Lenin as to the demands which he ought to put forward to Poland and as to future negotiations with the Entente. Kopp appears to be persona gratissima in Berlin and his nomination to the post of Bolshevik ambassador there is reported to have been due, in part at least, to requests put forward by the Germans themselves. That his influence in Berlin is a matter of old standing is shown by the fact that it was he aviio represented the German Military Party during the negotiations which resulted in Lenin getting through Germany from Switzerland to Russia in 1917. The recent release of Bela Kun in Vienna is said to have been largely due to his influence in Berlin.Theodore Rothstein, for long the secret agent of the Soviet Govern-ment in London, and the active link between the Soviet Delegation here and the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; is now in Moscow on his way to Berlin, where he will probably succeed Kopp.Miscellaneous.According to Schliapnikoff, the well-kuoAvn Commissar, Trotsky&apos;s special adherents are endeavouring to make him the &quot; Red Czar.&quot; This group has a centre in Stockholm, with a certain Emil Brusewitz as its director. The Stockholm firm of Hugo Geber is said to be entrusted with the propaganda and funds.FINLAND.Peace Negotiations with Soviet Russia.Bolshevik successes in the Polish Avar are having their repercussion on the peace negotiations with Finland, which have not as yet come to any conclusion, though the Bolsheviks claim that the Finns are now very
anxious for peace. The terrain of difference lias shifted, the Bolsheviks assuming an arrogant tone which has treated Finnish territorial con-contentions regarding the Petchonga region and the two districts of Eastern Karelia as of rapidly lessening relevance. The Russian delegates have also informed the Finns that the loan raised in Finland on&apos;behalf of the Imperial Russian Government must now be regarded by them as a bad debt.At home, meanwhile, Finnish Communists are becoming corre-correspondingly more daring in co-operation with their colleagues in Russia, and have sent a memorandum to the Finnish Foreign Office threatening direct action unless peace is concluded.At a recent secret meeting they passed a resolution in favour of allowing members of their Party to take service under the Finnish Foreign Office and War Office for the purpose of espionage. They will also do their utmost to obtain documents and effects tending to corn-promise the English and French Legations in Scandinavia.While the Soviet Government has advised Finnish Communists to take no part in the Aaland dispute, it is probable that Red Finns would take the opportunity of any serious disturbances which might arise on this question to carry out a coup (Feted at Helsiugfors. Their Committees appear to be well supplied with funds.Early in June it was reported that five Bolshevik agitators had arrived at Viborg from Petrograd for the purpose of organising &quot; Shook Proletarian battalions&quot; among Finnish workmen for use against the unfortunate bourgeoisie in the event of a revolutionary outbreak. A partial strike which broke out at Helsingfors on 1st July as a protest against the trial of Sulo Vuolijoki Pekkala and other extremists was regarded as the beginning of a more serious Labour movement.A prominent political worker in Helsingfors who had given vent in the Press to views opposed to the conclusion of commercial transactions with the Bolsheviks, and had written against the conclusion of peace with Russia, was visited by a notorious Bolshevik agent who guaranteed that if he would desist from abusing the Bolshevik regime his factory iu Soviet Russia would remain intact and his worn-out engines would be replaced with new ones by the Soviet Authorities.German Activities and the Scliutz Korps.Up to the end of Juue, evidence of German activities and influence in Finland, especially as regards the Schutz Korps, continued to accumulate. Terrijoki is reported now to be controlled by the pro-Germans, who are getting rid of all officials whom they dislike in that town.Von Kanitz, a German Monarchist, has been sent by von Liittwitz to Stockholm to negotiate, the sale of German arms and the employment of German officers with the Finns. Former reports regarding the delivery of German arms to the Schutz Korps are confirmed by the recent arrival at Haugo of a cargo from Germany which was declared by the skipper, the German ex-Submarine Commander, Captain Ernst von Richthofen, to consist of scrap copper, but turned out, on investigation by the police, really to be a hundred tons of arms and ammunition. Just before the vessel was due, Ausfeldt, the Commander of the Schutz Korps, asked Yalander, the Minister for War, for a motor-car, alleging that he had to go to Hango to meet, a special vessel. The motor-car was refused, but the incident proves that the cargo was intended for the Schutz Korps.Finland is, however, attempting to get rid of her indebtedness to Germany.   At a. secret meeting of the Finnish Diet held early in May
it was decided to pay off the debt to that country, and 70 million marks were, in fact, paid at the end of May.Communists.The local organisation of the Finnish Communist Party at Helsingfors has declared itself opeuly to be a Party, and adopted as its basis the programme of the Third International.Since the Authorities prevented the formation of the Finnish Labour Party owing to its declared adherence to the Third International, it will be interesting to soo what action the Government will take with regard to the newly-formed Communist Party at Helsingfors.Considerable propaganda is being carried on in Finland amongst Russian subjects with a view to persuading them to return to Soviet Russia, which, but for the lack of food and clothing in that country, they would probably do.Couriers.A Communist Information Bureau has been started in Viborg for the purpose of facilitating the passage of couriers between Finland and Soviet Russia. This Bureau, which is under the direction of Hanninen, is in possession of considerable funds. At a meeting held on 18th June at Viborg it was decided to send two Finnish Communists-to America with instructions to get into touch, with the Finnish comrades in the United States. The International Communist Congress at Milan in April last recommended the cessation of agitation in Finland for the present, on the grounds that the Finnish Government, in taking repressive measures, would make it difficult for couriers to pass through Finland from Soviet Russia.Last month the report on Finland was based upon information supplied from a source rather too closely in touch with the politicians of the Left. It must be remembered that persons who are sympathetic with the Germans and grateful to Germany for rescuing their country from the terror- are not necessarily pro-Germans in an offensive sense. Many of these have lately been meeting the British authorities half way and have done them great service. The Schutz Corps is reported to have fulfilled a useful purpose in ensuring respect for order, and in its ranks are many who do not dream of any policy of adventure. It is true that it receives arms from Germany, but that is rather a matter for those whose business it is to prevent arms from leaving Germany. The Finns are in no way bound by the Treaty of Versailles, and have a perfect right to secure arms if the Entente does not prevent them. There are, of course, undesirable elements in the Schutz Corps, such as General Ausfelde, an ex-German Staff Officer, and in the Army, too, for that matter. Probably,the gun-running is conducted by these Germans and by private individuals, not with the idea of starting a reactionary adventure, but in order to save the arms from the Allies, and to store them safely in Finland until Germany may have need of them. It - seems certain that the present Finnish Government is genuinely alarmed by the gun-running and is making every effort to get to the bottom of it.As regards the reported severity of the measures taken against Russians, it is very doubtful whether the Germans have anything to do -with them or would approve of them. The Finns are fairly convinced that Bolshevism is a cloak for a revival of Russian nationalisation, and they dread this more than they do the Red Terror. The hatred and dread of Russia is universal, and the Finns are quite alive to the fact that revived Russia under German domination, no matter what pledges
might be given, would be a far greater dauger tliau the old happy-go-lucky Russian Empire ever was. To describe the members of the present Government as extreme reactionaries is an over-statement. They are probably staunch patriots, faithful to the Finnish Constitution, and they would not favour the acceptance of German tutelage. -Thanks to Lord Curzon&apos;s action in the Aalaud question, and the proposal to hold a Conference in London for the conclusion of peace between Soviet Russia and the neighbouring States, British prestige is at the top of the wave. The Press is full of articles advocating a close understanding with England as the only hope of salvation for Finland. The Finn is a shrewd person, too shrewd to quarrel with bis bread and butter, and his bread and butter lies in doing business in timber and paper with Great Britain. - Every Finn, including most of the Ministers, is in business of some kind. There is practically no land-owning class and England is the best market for Finnish produce. Finland can buy advantageously from Germany but cannot sell to her.&apos; Wages are high, work is plentiful, and the standard of prosperity is high. Strikes and labour troubles have occurred, but they are negligible as compared with those in other countries.Baltic States.ESTHONIA. Gukowsky&apos;s Delegation at Reval.Gukowsky, the Bolshevik Trade Representative at Reval, has been relieved of his post there. He has gone to Riga and his successor at Reval is reported to be one Moritz Willpos. Before Gukowsky left considerable antagonism was said to exist between the groups of his Delegation at Reval and a number of former Russian business men who had taken the opportunity which membership of the Delegation offered of getting out of Soviet Russia; so that of the 50 members of the Delegation only seven were reported to belong to the Communist Party or even to be sympathisers with Communist doctrines. Gukowsky himself adopted a moderate attitude for which the sentiments of his entourage may have accounted.It is reliably reported that a considerable amount of propaganda literature for use in France and England arrived at Reval late in June and that Gukowsky acted as intermediary for its distribution. He is further reported to have given 1,500,000 Esthonian marks to further strikes in Esthonia.Economic Situation.The economic situation in Esthonia is rapidly becoming serious. The cost of living has gone up and the Government is increasing taxation to iu unheard of extent.   The financial situation is said to be desperate.The Supreme Court for combatting speculation leaves intermediaries and speculators in &quot;valuta&quot; undaunted. Bribery is rife, especially amongst the impoverished higher officials.The nationalisation of all houses and even of shops by the Govern-ment is pretty generally expected.Refugees from Russia.There is a continual flow of refugees from Soviet Russia to Esthonia. These refugees, however, especially if they are doctors or specialists of any kind, are not generally welcomed by the Esthonian Government, which appears anxious to second the Soviet Authorities in inducing them to return and is correspondingly reluctant to grant them permits to remain.
The guarantees given by representatives of Gukowsky&apos;s Mission at Reval to previous applicants have not been maintained by the Soviet Authorities, as it is rumoured that refugees who have returned have undergone imprisonment and have evon in some cases been shot. Applications to go back to Soviet Russia are few. Even some of the Esthonian Communists deported to Sovdepia have since returned to their own country, stating their willingness to undergo any punishment rather than to return to Russia.We are reliably informed that the information regarding the activi-ties of the Fortington Group in Esthonia (see June report Esthonia, Trade Affairs) is incorrect, and the imputations against this trading company accordingly fall to the ground.LATVIA.The prolongation of Peace negotiations between Latvia and Soviet Russia is reported to be intentional. The effect of the conclusion of Peace on the exchange would introduce further difficulties into the internal life of the country, and peace with the Bolsheviks would arouse pretensions on the part of the working classes to which the Government do not feel inclined to respond. It must not be forgotten, also, that the policy of the border States is very largely dependent on the policy of Great Britain, and the negotiations between Latvia and Soviet Russia have been influenced by the indefiniteness, as it appears abroad, of British policy. Though the Letts see that, in default of a stronger antagonistic attitude on the part of Great Britain, they will have to conclude peace, neither the old Government which appointed their Peace Delegation, nor the new, which is maintaining it, are willing to accept the responsibility for a bad Peace, and the negotiations have been prolonged because of the Governments desire to place the responsibility on the political parties themselves, a policy requiring continual reference.The present Constituent Assembly in Latvia is moderate, but as no single party is in absolute majority, the attitude and groupings of small parties are of considerable significance. The Social Democrats, the strongest individual party in the Assembly, tend to be Democrat rather that Socialist. Their official organ, the &quot; Social Democrat&quot; of Riga, analysing the results of the election in April, at which no less than 24 parties put in claims for representation, declares that the results work out into a Bourgeois majority of 93 against a Socialist majority of 57. The Social revolutionaries, the party nearest Moscow in doctrine, ran unsuccessful candidates in two divisions. In Riga, which is supposed to be the hot-bed of extremism, they are reported only to have polled 462 out of a total of 95,000 votes. It is noted that the deputies of localities which have been for some time under the sub-jection of the Bolsheviks, tend much more to the Right than those of localities which have not been under the Bolshevik regime.LITHUANIA.There was a hitch in the June negotiations between Lithuania and Soviet Russia because the Bolsheviks insisted on a military agreement. The situation has since then been so enveloped in the fog of the Polish war that almost anything which could be written runs the risk of being reversed before we go to press.The Poles, under Bolshevik pressure, entered into an agreement with the Lithuanians by which the latter country obtained the Vilna enclave, which the Bolsheviks subsequently overran and occupied, and which, having once occupied, it is presumed that they will treat pan passu with the rest of Poland.
POLAND.The Polish situation, at the time of going to press, is no longer &quot;governed even by military events, but has passed into the sphere of European and even of World politics. In the military and indeed in every other sense the Avorst conceivable has befallen. As a country bereft, in consequence of its own unwisdom, of the very power to react, :the fate of Poland lies for the moment in the hands of her conquerors, to whose most extravagant pretensions she must perforce submit. Diplomatic pressure by the Entente and by America appears to be her sole remaining hope. Whether Russia having now so magnificently succeeded in planting her ueAV standard in the midst of Europe wiLI abate the success which, more than ever before, appears as if it might weld the Soviet system of Government into a Avorld power, may perhaps be known before this appears in print.It is not so now. All that is possible under this heading is a partial record blotted by the disaster.   .Litvinoff, in reply to a question in Moscow as to his opinion on the policy Russia should pursue in Poland, answered that in his view peace should not be made before Lemberg and Warsaw fall into Russian, bauds. He points to the extreme &quot;elasticity &quot; of the ethnographical frontiers of which the Allies speak, and says that if the occupation of these towns proves impossible, the Russians must insist that the Allies and the Poles give sufficient guarantees to put a neAv offensive on Poland&apos;s part out of the question and an assurance that land taken by Poland Avould be evacuated.,, Litvinoff is insisting that the Allies are helpless as far as direct and speedy aid to Poland is concerned. Diversions by Roumania aDd Finland and a reneAval of hostilities by Wrangel he thinks they might possibly ;arrange. In his opinion everything depends upon the attitude of the -/working classes in the Entente countries. He appears not to be so ,certain as some of his colleagues of their powers in the last resort of preventing the despatch of ammunition should it be seriously undertaken, and is certain that the workers can do nothing to prevent foreign &quot;intrigue&quot; against Soviet Russia. He warns the Soviet Government that they must walk delicately and must, until their position in Poland is absolutely established, continue to declare that they will make no attempt against its independence. Litvinoff is inclined to recommend the cori-clusion by the Soviet Government of a defensive and offensive alliance -with the Galicians, Avho have reported to be able to put 100,000 men in the field. He is inclined to welcome the idea of the creation of an independent Galicia between Poland and the Ukraine.At the beginning of the month it seemed clear that anti-Russian rather than anti-Bolshevik feeling was at the bottom of the hearts of most Polesj and that until better feeling prevailed no cordial under-standing with the Russians could be reached. The first essential towards a rapprochement between the two countries was then thought in some quarters to be a clear and emphatic declaration defining the attitude of the Poles towards the National Russians.One very clear feature of the political situation was the, general -apathy of the upper classes in Poland, who appeared indifferent to the outcome of the even then very critical situation.   They were reported as perfectly content, if they could not have the control of affairs and reduce
the country to a state of semi-feudalism, to sec Poland cease to exist as a soparate State.Pilsudski&apos;s popularity was then on the wane even among his troops, and there were constant rumours of a plot to establish a military dictatorship under one of his generals.As regards the failure on the southern front, the Polish Diet was entirely taken by surprise, and the Cabinet crisis which led to the resignation of Skulski was not due to this failure but to the Govern-ment project for the requisition of crops. The new Government, under Grabski, was unpopular and not expected to live long.Although the June strikes at Warsaw were attributed to economic conditions, their subsidies from Russia were also suspected. The news from the front added to the general unrest, among the working classes; they leaked out in spite of nil the authorities could do to suppress adverse reports. The Government yielded at a touch to almost all the men&apos;s demands, but sternly suppressed disturbances. The workers strongly resented their measures, and, though the strike situation improved, it was expected that the consequent increase in the price of articles of food in daily use was laying up serious labour unrest for the future.Behind the front the Bolsheviks were naturally very active in propa-ganda, and inflammatory leaflets urging the Polish soldiers to refuse to fight came into the hands of the Polish authorities. It is just to say that, as far as can bo ascertained, these leaflets appear to have had little effect.A voluntary and self-supporting organisation called &quot; The Society for Self-Help,&quot; founded in order to combat Bolshevism in all its forms, did exceedingly valuable work during the strikes in Warsaw. This society is composed of students and members of the upper and middle classes generally and has a membership of 12,000.A rather sinister story of German preparations for a stab at the back of the Poles has come into our hands. A certain. Sergey Gershel-mann, an agent of Durnovo&apos;s, was reported in June to be active at Sbavli, where he was engaged in organising former participators in the White movement. He has recruited a certain number of officers and men from Latvia and Esthonia and obtained the services of former members of the German Iron Division. His organisation was supplied with funds by Bermont, who, according to information received from Berlin, had under-taken to strike the Poles in the rear in the direction of Kovno. The check of the Polish Army modified Bermont&apos;s plans, and he was said not to contemplate action unless the Bolsheviks were again forced to retire. In such a case he would, it was reported, attack the Poles in the rear in conjunction with Lithuanian troops.The division in policy between the two sections of the Russian Cadet Party has a bearing upon Poland. One section of that Party favours adhesion to General wrangel&apos;s plan, while others were up till recently anxious to arrange a Russo-Polish entente and to establish a Russian Government in Warsaw, in which project they were reported to have the support of the Social Revolutionaries under Boris Savinkov. It is also reported that one party in Poland, of whose influence and authority in the country we have no means of judging, convinced that in the long run they would not be able to stand up against Soviet Russia, were said in June to regard not unfavourably the formation of a Russian Government of this stamp in Poland. It is more than doubtful, however, whether the rooted dislike of the Pole for the Russian would allow such a scheme to come to anything.
5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES. JUGO-SLAVIA.The Communist Party in Jugo-Slsivia is reported to ho more national than international and to approximate closely in political doctrine to the ,Social Democratic Party. In reality, although it has grown rapidly, it is at home only in the town of Agram. The peasants, who form 80 to 90 per cent, of the population, are far too well off to bother about Communistic doctrines.In the reforming of the Government in February 1920 the Social Democrats and Democrats refused to join the Radicals. The three leaders of the Social Democratic Party were therefore dropped from the Cabinet, and their position was taken by the minority leaders, who have succeeded in pulling the whole Party over to the Left, with resultant Communist gains at the recent elections.The period since the elections has been marked by considerable industrial disturbances and by strongly repressive measures on the part of the Government, who quite recently are reported to have taken the extreme steps of arresting the members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and of closing the Bolshevik newspaper printing offices and labour houses. It is doubtful whether this policy of repression does not rather serve to give cohesion aud strength to the Communists and to gain for them the sympathy of the masses than to alleviate the trouble.There is considerable danger in the aggressive character of the Serbs, many of whom have become infected with revolutionary ideas during their service in foreign lands. Communism has also been introduced in the country via Odessa aud Constantinople by refugees from Russia, while returned soldiers are said to be spreading propaganda in favour of Soviet Russia.The Italians are not known to have seiit money to help this propa-ganda, but, with a view doubtless to stepping in at the appropriate moment to restore a situation of their own making, they have sent political agitators to promote Communism in Jugo-Slavia. The danger appears to be that, although the bulk of the country may be sound, a minority of Communists may yet succeed in producing urban conditions not unlike those in many parts of Soviet Russia itself.ROUMANIA.In spite of rumours to the effect that the eighty millions of gold recently sent to Sweden by the Soviet Government for the purchase of agricultural machinery is the property of the Roumanians, there seems little doubt that the Roumanian metallic stock in Russia has remained untouched. Krassin has given a formal guarantee to this effect, and a representative of the Danish Red Cross who visited Moscow recently has reported that he personally saw the seals of the Roumanian Government on the doors of the strong room in which the gold reserve was stored.A new weekly Bolshevik paper called Ujember is being published in Roumania by well, known Hungarian Bolsheviks who escaped from Budapest last November. It would appear from the fact that their paper is allowed to come out, whilst other Socialist papers in Bucharest are being prohibited, that they are working with the knowledge of the Roumanian authorities.
GREECE.The Royalists.Early in Juno the Italian Government allowed the ex-King, who had been ordered a cure, to enter Italy. The cure was, of course, merely a pretext. The point at issue was whether ex-King Constantino would be allowed to travel freely in an Entente country. The upshot was regarded by the Greek Royalists as an important diplomatic success which would have considerable influence on public opinion in Greece, where, up to the present, the Venizelos Press has always insisted that the ex-King is regarded by the Allies as a political prisoner interned in Switzerland. A good deal of pro-Constantine propaganda is being carried on in Italy, where an agreement has been made with six prominent papers for a Press campaign in favour of the Royalists. Funds, some of which are being used, to support the paper &quot; Roma,&quot; published in Naples, are being collected in America for the Greek Royalist cause.Despite these activities, the adversaries of Venizelos&apos; policy abroad are now of opinion that propaganda against the existing regime has been too exclusively Monarchist. To place their propaganda on a more democratic basis they have opened a News Agency in Berlin under the direction of the Greek writer, Dscheleppy, an ex-employe of the German Foreign Office. Dscheleppy&apos;s Bureau will issue bi-weekly communiques in French, German, and. English.Communists.The Governments proposal for the formation of a volunteer army to meet their needs in Thrace and Asia Minor met with an excellent response. The Labour situation in Greece is good, and there are few or no signs of Bolshevism.Since his release from prison the Bolshevik Beuaroya has come to the conclusion that anything like a Pan-Hellenic Congress of Socialists would be likely to result in a move towards the Right, He therefore arranged to get the Congress postponed. A split within the Party has been the result.Strikes.The lock-out in the tobacco trade caused a general strike throughout Macedonia about the middle of June. The Government was firm and the movement was factitious. It collapsed. The upshot had been that the Moderates have formed unions of their own and have severed their connection with the extremists.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.The concerted pressure brought to bear upon the Turkish Nationalists and their covert associates by the Greeks against Mustafa Kemal in Asia Minor, and against Jafar Tayar in Thrace, and by the French against the Emir Feisul in Syria have had their effect, and the Peace terms have been signed by the Turkish Government. An undertaking so given cannot, however, be regarded as a valid guarantee, and is sound only as a justification for further pressure by the Allies should this become necessary. The effect of the measures may be traceable in M. Krassin&apos;s recent announcement that the Soviet Government will abstain from
pressure or from propaganda in the Near and Middle East, though for this again the Polish successes of the Soviet Government were probably sufficient to account. Those measures, as noted elsewhere, do not appear to be exerting a ponderable influence upon the Egyptian negotiations where Ireland and our own domestic difficulties with labour amply counteract them.Reports received during the month confirm the view that whatever may have been signed, preponderant opinion in Turkey is not behind the signature. It has even been reported from a good source that Envor Pasha signed an agreement in May with the Bolsheviks by which Turkey was to adopt the same economic regime as Russia. It is quite improbable that she would, but the report, if true, indicates the length Turkish extremists are willing to go. Meanwhile, Halil Pasha, Djemal Pasha, and Fuad Bey are to remain in Moscow to manage Mustafa Kemal Pasha&apos;s Legation, and it is believed that Euver Pasha&apos;s wife and family have left Constantinople for Berlin.In confirmation of previous reports pointing to the collaboration between the Italian Government and the Turkish Nationalists, definite proof has been obtained that the Turkish Foreign Office was in communi-cation with the Italian High Commissioner during the month of May last, about the active assistance to be given by Italy to the Nationalist cause. The Italian High Commissioner was asked by the Turkish Government to put an end to this assistance, on the ground that the difficulties of the Turkish Government were thereby increased.The signature of the Peace terms will probably be followed by another crop of the delays, evasions, and attempted reservations which are the staple of Turkish diplomacy under pressure. The Turkish Government, when it was confronted with the Peace terms, showed itself less anxious than formerly to tn.ke the responsibility of openly opposing the Nationalist movements in Asia Minor and Thrace. In this it appears to have been encouraged by information transmitted by Tewfik Pasha to the Grand Vizier, that both France and Italy considered it necessary for their political and economic interests that there should be a strong Turkey acting in agreement with them. Prince Abdul Mejid Effendi, the heir apparent, addressed a letter to the Sultan urging him to repudiate the Peace Treaty and recommending him to use his influence to put an end to the struggle between the Government and the Nationalists so that a united front &quot;could be presented during the present crisis, and the Court Martial with which Jafar Tayar Bey had been threatened before the terms of the Treaty were known was cancelled.On being approached in June by representatives of the Central Government the Nationalists Assembly at Angora reserved its liberty of action and declared that its object in meeting these representatives was merely to ascertain how far its own purposes could be reconciled with those of the Cabinet.PERSIA.A meeting of Young Turks, Arabs, and Persian Nationalists was held at Lugano on 1st June. The President, Nedjmeddin Mollah, reported that the Congress recently held in Munich had decided that all Islam should support the union between Mustapha Kemal and the Russian Soviet Government. In accordance with this agreement Persia was to be occupied and a Nationalist Government set up, which, once in power, would place its armed forces at the disposal of the Bolsheviks . and Mustapha Kemal. Russia would equip these troops and give armed support to the new Government against England until the Nationalist
army should be ready. The military operations contemplated were on a large scale, and Persia would assist in the passage of troops to Afghanistan and co-operate in military operations on the Iudo-Afghan frontier.At the close of the Lugano meeting, Mollah stated that the Munich Congress had approved of pourparlers for a political understanding which had been begun in Rome between the Turkish Nationalist representative and a member of the Italian Government.Meanwhile the Soviet Government continues to maintain that the Persian Revolution is gathering way under its own impetus and is the doing of individual partisans over whom it has no control. In fact, the &quot;neutrality&quot; of the Soviet Government in Persia is not unlike the&apos; disinterestedness of the different Balkan States in Macedonia before the war. Soviet Russia also has its &quot; Committee &quot; for propaganda in Persia, and in the sacred name of self-determination will free that country from the &quot;oppression&quot; of the British, whose &quot; cowardice &quot; in the evacuation of Enzeli was the cause of much exultation in Soviet circles.EGYPT.The Nationalist Delegation in Europe.The intransigence of the Nationalist Delegation in London is reported to be maintained by the present general state of Unrest, the situation in Ireland, and the fact that it has nailed its colours so high that the smallest concession will stamp its members as renegades to their cause. In such circumstances the difference of shade betAveen moderates and extremists within the Delegation is outwardly slight. Allowing for this, Zaghloul Pasha himself may be said rather to represent the moderate element, which is described as anxious and worried, a state of mind to be accounted for partly by its dread of the extremes to which it may be driven should the present negotiations fail, partly by. fear of the extremer members of the Delegation, and partly by the dread of physical violence at the hands of the extremists of the Watanist party both in this country and in Paris. The present firm stand of the Delegation as a whole is attributed to consciousness that they are in the limelight. Should the negotiations break doAvu and the members of the Delegation return to Egypt, it is thought that they will be obliged to take up an attitude far more extreme than that to which the saner of them are themselves inclined. Zaghloul is said to be unfortunate in his entourage, Avho are described as, Avith a few exceptions, a conceited and ignorant collection of Orientals quite unrepresentative of the saner Egyptians, and probably chosen for their supposed knowledge of Europe rather than for such knowledge as they may have of Egypt. There is some fear that Zaghloul himself may not be strong enough for the position (uoav indubitably difficult) to Avhich he has attained OAving partly to his relative honesty and partly to the limitations of his character.Conditions in Egypt.There is reason to believe that the Bolsheviks were mixed up with the 24 hours&apos; strike Avhich took place at Alexandria on June 7th as a protest against high prices and excessive rents charged for shops and business premises.Alexandria has a rather feminine way with her. Whenever she is crossed she revolts. She pouted in the same way at Caesar and Mark Antony, and she descends into the streets to-day as much to relieve monotony as with  an idea of being  taken  seriously.   -A - certain-
Rosenthal, however, who has been talcing a rather prominent part on occasions of this sort, is known to have Bolshevik tendencies. One of his assistants, like minded with himself, is a Russian woman and a refugee. Indeed the Russian refugees at Tel-el-Kebir, of whom she is one, constitute.elements of considerable unrest which are causing soino anxiety to the authorities.Abdul Malik Hamza, formerly editor of the Pan-Islamic paper &quot;Die Islamische Welt,&quot; was sent early in Juno by Zaghloul to Italy to assist Abdul Hamid Said. The latter is known to have been sending bombs to Egypt from Italy for the use of Egyptian Nationalists. It is also reported that small consignments of arms, mainly revolvers, but with a few rifles also, are being smuggled into Egypt through the ports of Monopoli and Bisceglie via Brindisi. The arms are believed to have reached these ports in fishing boats, which convey them to Brindisi, where they are smuggled on board a Greek ship plying between that port aud Patras, whence again they are sent to Egypt.The Society of Vengeance.Abd el Rahman Bey Fahmi, the secretary of the central committee of the Egyptian Delegation at Cairo, and 28 others, including one Kiriaikos Mikhail, a deportee, were arrested on 5th July on a charge of being members of a society -of vengeance against the Sultan Fouad, the Government, and the High Commissioner, and of incitement to sedition and murder. The seals set upon Abd el Rahman Bey&apos;s rooms by the authorities were found to be broken when the perquisitioniug body arrived. The Chief of the Public Security Department and the Com-mandant of Police, both prominent Englishmen, were censured for neglect of duty by the Military Court investigating the affair, the implications-tion being that subordinates of their own had been concerned in the abstraction of documents. One of the prisoners has now turned King&apos;s, evidence, and has laid bare the whole plot, with which one of the members of the Delegation in London appears to be connected. Members of the Delegation in London are trying to secure the services of Mr. Marshall Hall for Abd el Rahman Bey&apos;s defence.It is reliably reported that one Mohammad Ibrahim Edhem, a Cretan, interned during the war, is now at liberty and running a boarding-house at Alexandria, which is said to harbour explosives and exponents of the &quot;Rights of Man.&quot; It has been suggested that the police were not disinterested in his liberation.The Consular Court has committed Sir William Willcocks and Lieutenant-Colonel Kennedy for trial on a charge of criminal and seditous libel in connection with the charges which they brought against Sir Murdoch Macdonald, Adviser to the Egyptian Ministry of Public Works.   (See Report No. 16, February 1920.)7. FAR EASTERN STATES. JAPAN.The Bolsheviks appear to be somewhat anxious concerning the situation in Siberia. The Japanese Press is full of a campaign for the continuation of the Japanese occupation of Eastern Siberia, and even the Opposition Party in the Japanese Parliament, while still insisting on the withdrawal of Japanese troops, has passed a resolution stating that for the present these troops must remain in Siberia for the protection of Japanese residents.   It is rumoured that Japan is preparing to carry out
a coup d^etat which will establish an anti-Bolshevik Government in the Trans-Baikal Republic with Horwath as the Japanese candidate for the presidency.In view of the various rumours which are current concerning the employment of German experts by the Japanese, it is interesting to note that there are no less than 12 Japanese officers attached to the Japanese Embassy in Berlin,CHINA.Overtures from Soviet Russia.The two main causes of unrest in China at present appear to be dissatisfaction with the corrupt and jarring Government of the Chinese Militarists and anti-Japanese feeling regarding Tsiugtau.Under military administration the food situation is rapidly becoming serious in Peking. Prices are rising fast and unscrupulous persons are cornering the stocks. Motor cars, carts, and coolies are being com-mandeered in large numbers by the military authorities without hope of recovery or compensation to their owners. Outside the city, where troops are concentrating, the growing crops are being eaten up or wantonly destroyed, so that hope of recovering the failure of the spring harvest in North China is becoming.more remote.The causes of these discontents are set forth in a letter of thanks addressed to the Bolsheviks by the Ningpo Guild and the Nationalist Organisations Union. This letter, which is in reply to a recently published, but officially unanswered, note addressed in April by the Soviet Government to the Government in Peking, thanked the Bolsheviks for their goodwill to China and their desire to secure closer relations between China and Soviet Russia.The unanswered Bolshevik overtures to which the letter refers offered the following terms to China as an. inducement to open up official trade relations with the Soviet Government: (1) The cession to China of the Chinese Eastern Railway without compensation. (2). Restoration of forestry and mining concessions. (3) Renouncement of the Boxer indemnity.Bolshevik Influences.Dr. Sun Yat Sen, who has been mentioned in former reports, is the head of the Bolshevik organisation at Shanghai and has the support of General Chan Chiung Ming, who is stated to control 30,000 troops in Fukien. It is generally believed that the General and Sun Yat Sen will eventually raise the Red Flag in China and that they already maintain touch with the Bolsheviks in Vladivostock. Russian agents have visited Sun Yat Sen in Shanghai and travel freely between the two places.. Some of Sun Yat Sen&apos;s followers are transmitting Bolshevik news and literature to Socialists in Japan.Chinese students have founded a branch of the Clarte group at Peking and this branch is in touch with the headquarters of the movement in France. The Peking group believes in the regeneration of China by Bolshevik influence and example, and avers that the great Chinese Republic will receive from Russia the material necessary for the liberation of the Orient from the despotic bourgeois capitalism of the West.Both the London &quot; Daily Herald &quot; and the American &quot; New York Call &quot; are in circulation amongst the Chinese in Shanghai,0 11887 .. d
SIBERIA.The elections of the Vladivostock Government resulted in 12 seats going to the Communists, eight to the Mensheviks and other extreme Socialists, four to the Democrats, and one to the Right Socialist Revolutionaries.The Japanese apparently have three alternatives as regards their policy in Siberia. They propose either to establish Semenoff, a policy to which the Militarists adhere, or to form a Government composed of Democrats, or to reform the existing Government by readjusting the balance in their favour. If Semenoff were established he will deal severely with the Bolsheviks and act more or less as a Japanese agent. Japan has offered to behave liberally to a Government of which she approves and will let it have supplies for the population, and a loan of 100 million yen on favourable terms.Koltchak&apos;s Government deposited a good deal of money in Chinese Banks. This was sequestrated by the Russian Ambassador at Pekin, who refused to hand it over to the Zemstvo Government or to the Moscow Government except under assurances, supported by proof, that the money would be spent on the proletariat.CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.Azerbaijan.The eoup (Petat at Baku signalised what was in reality nothing less than the sale of Azerbaijan to Russia ,by agreement between local Pan-Islamists and Turkish Nationalists. Before occupying Baku the Azerbaijan Bolsheviks waited until the Soviet troops were ready to co-operate with them. There can be no question at whose instigation the step was taken. Facts and motives, the latter based upon oil and the desire to co-operate with Turkey, point unmistakably to Soviet Russia.The Bolshevik coup in Baku was not the result of the efforts of Azerbaijan to increase-its territory at the expense of its neighbours, or to use Pan-Islamism as a political weapon, but was primarily due to internal disintegration and anarchy.The Russian Foreign Office, true to its former announcement that it would act as a protector for these sorely harassed states, has already disclaimed, and will continue to disclaim, responsibility for doings there. The fact is none the less that what passes at Baku is done at its instigation and cannot be done without its authority.Azerbaijan, once Tartar and Moslem, is now mainly Russian and Bolshevist. Two out of six of the principal Commissaries, Pankratoff and Mme. Raskolnikova, wife of the victor at Enzeli, now Admiral of-the Caspian Fleet, together present the common blend of Jew and. Russian ; two others are Georgians, completely dominated by the same influence ; while only two, and these the least influential, are Tartars. The Chrezvychaika, or Extraordinary Commission, which is reported to be not at all provincial iu the nature of its activities, but to carry matters with the hand of Moscow or Petrograd, is also officered by Russians. Russians are likewise reported to hold many of the minor offices of state.Almost entirely Russian, again, is the Army; largely composed of the former Astrakhan Army which has been acting with Bolshevist troops against the Georgians. The Tartars in it have been disbanded, and, with their followers, have incurred the penalties due to Mussavats or non-Communists. They have, that is to say, to submit to the imprison-ments and executions, or more broadly, the massacres, which are the
40meed of capitalism. The worst catastrophe was, of course, that of Elizabetpol, where a Tartar rising was cruelly suppressed, some 12,000 being killed and the town largely destroyed. After the subjugation of Elizavetpol, the Bolshevik punitive detachments moved up to Nukha, where they were also guilty of grave excesses, though on a smaller scale than *at the former place. The entire Muhammedan National Council was arrested, and with them a considerable number of leading local Muhammedans. Some of the latter were shot. On the plea that the Moslems were using their mosques for political meetings, the Bolsheviks prohibited them entering the mosques. This order happened to coincide with the final days of Ramazan, and gave rise to considerable indignation and hostility on the part of the local Moslem population. Minor massacres have ensued, so that the country seems to reflect with the accuracy of a diminishing mirror the doings of its neighbour to the north. The Tartar and Moslem masses are believed now fully to realise how far the Bolsheviks are from being the defenders of their ancient rights. The news of the outrages will be echoed far and wide throughout the Mohammedan world, and should shake the faith of Mustafa Kemal in his allies. Unfortunately, it is unlikely to shake Lenin, and Mustafa Kemal is no longer what he was.Armenia.It is the Bolshevik boast to have accomplished that which European Powers have for years back promised and attempted to become the efficient protector of the small republics of the Caucasus. Negotiations long drawn out are proceeding in Moscow between the republic of Armenia and Soviet Russia. Meanwhile, the &quot; protectqr &quot; has become somewhat pressing. Russian troops have occupied the districts east of Erivan, and, further to the South, the mainly Armenian neutral area of Karabagh. In Nakhichevan, again, which Tchitcherine requires in order that he may have a clear frontier with Nationalist Turkey, the Armenians have had to resort to arms, with fair success so far, thanks to consignments of munitions.Georgia.Popular feeling in Georgia is described as both anti-Russian and anti-Bolshevik. This is said to be largely due to Bolshevik duplicity regarding Batum. In June the Georgian Bolshevists, simple folk relishing the pure milk of the Communist word, decided to associate themselves more closely with the Central Communist Party in Russia. Their committee at Tiflis now calls itself the Temporary Central Committee of the Georgian Communist organisations. The arrival at Tiflis of the Bolshevist representative, Kyroff, with a large staff, 81 automobiles, and many women, expensive-looking and bejewelled, dis-inclined, moreover, to conceal his conviction that the Bolshevist peace with Georgia was a mere armistice, is said to have given them furiously to think.Daghestan.There is reason to believe that the Bolshevik administration in Daghestan is largely unpopular. A new Emir of the North Caucasus has been nominated, who appears to be busy engaged in organising a rising of Chechens. The country, though officially Bolshevik and controlled by a revolutionary committee in the place of the late Defence Council of the North Caucasus, has by no means lost its national character. Feeling is strong in favour of independence, and although the Bolshevik Commissar has issued one of those decrees stereotyped ind 2
Moscow which guarantee the independence of these small states, the populace is reported to be healthily sceptical.Northern Caucasus.In the Northern Caucasus constant risings of counter revolutionary elements were in June reported to be taking place, the Bolsheviks resorting to strong repressive measures. This has been the case especially in the Terek Provinces, in Chechnia, and in Ingushetia, where conflicts took place with the Soviet troops, and the people are aggrieved at the rise in prices and the requisitioning of houses by the Bolshevik Authorities.Khivan Republic.The geographical position of Khiva renders it practically negligible as regards the Pan-Islamic movement. A certain Muraclov is now established as head of the republic, and was supported by the Bolsheviks in his inter-tribal war with the Yamuts. Muradov is a Turcoman and is supported by the Tashkent Soviet. It is believed that popular sympathy is far from welcoming the Bolsheviks, despite the busy propaganda of the Soviet Oriental Department.8. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Labour Possibilities.Labour continues quiet, and excellent reports have been received from most of the centres. The situation is, however, governed by two serious possibilities the shortage of coal, and an impending demand of the Cauadian railway unions for the schedule of wages demanded in the United States. This schedule would amount in Canada to a wage increase of some 30 million dollars. Owing to the concerted action of the several brotherhoods, the demand, if refused, would mean a general railway strike and disorganisation of the distributive system of the country. An attempt, too, is being made in the Cape Breton coalfields to cut down the production of coal by half, and there is no doubt that the coal shortage has strengthened the hands of the men aud of the agitators.In Quebec men of the influential Catholic and National unions, which are under the control of the local priests, are agitating for higher wages. Trouble from this source is, however, reported to be unlikely.An extraordinary report has been circulated in Montreal that the employees in the Amalgamated Clothing Workers are devoting a large proportion of their recent wage increases, averaging 5 dollars a week, to propaganda purposes. If true, the pecuniary resources of a very revolutionary body will be greatly increased. The organisers, in all things revolutionary, are Bicheroff, of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, and J. A. Lanch and J. Schubert, of the Lady Garment Workers.   The special fund is now said to amount to 45,000 dollars.Radicals in Winnipeg are very suspicious of each other, aud several have been accused of being &quot; police spies.&quot;Extremists.General conditions have certainly improved during the last month; the agitators have said all there is to say, and the rank and file are losing interest in their teaching. This is said to be particularly notice-able among the Russian population.
LJnion strike leaders are using unprincipled methods when dealing with foreign members. In one case, at a lumber camp, where the men were avowedly striking for an 8-hour day, several foreigners declared their intention to go out to Vancouver, as the company was unfair to them. They had been led to believe that it was the Governments fault that they were no longer allowed to work for 12 hours a day as before, and bitterly resented the diminution of their earnings by about 30 dollars a month.&quot; The Revolt,&quot; the official organ of the Socialist Party of Quebec, edited by Hymau Edelstyne, is to be issued monthly.A report has been received from Mrs. Pankhurst, who is at present lecturing in Canada on Imperial Unity and the need for co-operation in industry. She states that anti-British propaganda is being carried on in Canada, that apparently very little is being done to counteract it, and that what is being done is not co-ordinated. The propaganda takes many forms, sometimes Bolshevist, sometimes Republican ; and is greatest where there are United States American settlers.A pamphlet is being distributed purporting to be an intercepted report from Sir William Wiseman to Mr. Lloyd George, revealing a British plot to make the United States a British colony again. The pamphlet is published by the &quot; Statesman Press,&quot; in New York, and is called &quot; The Re-conquest of America,&quot; price 10 cents, &quot; Agents wanted.&quot; Marten&apos;s weekly, &quot; Soviet Russia,&quot; is also prominently displayed on every news stand.At the meetings at which Miss Pankhurst spoke, leaflets, openly seditious, were given out by Bolshevists stationed at the doors of the hall.   They bore no printers or publishers names.The Quebec Independent Socialist Party in Montreal, with Gerrish at its head, is trying to link up with the Sinn Fein movement. Gerrish is understood to be the local direct representative of the &quot; Third Inter-national of England.&quot; His wife, who is also an agitator, is going out to join him.. Sinn Feiners in Montreal have formed a &quot; Self-Determination&quot; League, which is said to have collected 40,000 dollars, including two contributions of 10,000 dollars each.At a meeting of the Socialist Party of Canada, on May 23rd, Frank Cassidy attacked Sinn Fein as a capitalist organisation, while declaring that there was &quot; too much superstition and Catholicism iu Ireland to accept Socialism.&quot;The One Big Union.Recent reports all tend to show that the One Big Union is steadily losing ground. The American Federation of Labour in its convention in Montreal voted against Bolshevism, and decided to fight the One Big Union first in Winnipeg and then in Vancouver, where union propaganda has had some success. The Union appears to be guided from the head office at Vancouver, where one Midgley is the secretary. One of the chief reasons for the decline of the One Big Union is the prevalence of the foreign element; the foreigner is afraid of being deported as a Bolshevik and will no longer lead or agitate. In Saskatchewan the One Big Union is spoken of as a foreign organisation led by rascals whose sympathy with Bolshevism is as rascally as themselves. Tom Moore&apos;s recent denunciation of it has had a great effect on the average worker.The Foreign Element.Ukrainians in Edmonton have formed a radical organisation named &quot; Samo-Obrazowania,&quot; which works with the &quot;Ukrainian Labour News &quot;
of Winnipeg. The leaders are men who showed disloyalty during the war and are strongly Bolshevistic and revolutionary. The One Big Union has taken a page in the &quot; Ukrainian Labour News &quot; to carry on propaganda in the Ukrainian language.The Editor of the &quot; Pravda-i-Vola &quot; (Truth and Freedom) is at once a Socialist and a supporter of Bishop Budka. The partisans of the Ukrainian Labour Temple and the &quot;Ukrainian Labour News&quot; are opposed to him, but he is undoubtedly a dangerous man and advocates Bolshevism in bis speeches.Speeches in French at a meeting in Montreal of the Socialist Com-munist Party, a French Canadian body, incited the people to break open the shops and &quot; take what they were entitled to.&quot;Esthonians in Canada do not exceed 2,000, of whom about 250 are in and about Vancouver. Many of these are against internationalism as advocated by Socialists, and think of returning to Europe since Esthonia has been declared an independent republic.A great deal of revolutionary matter, chiefly in Russian and Polish, is being taken into the Niagara peninsula from Buffalo for distribution among foreigners in the various industries.Labour Churches.The appearance of what are termed Labour Churches in Western Canada is worthy of note as a feature of social unrest. The first of these &quot; churches &quot; was established in Winnipeg by the Rev. William Ivens in the winter of 1918-19, and the movement is undoubtedly growing.These &quot; churches&quot; disregard doctrine or dogma. The Executive Committee &quot; argue that the purpose of the Labour Church is to teach economics and not the doctrines of Christianity.&quot; Open and notorious anti-Christians and anti-religionists have been active in the affairs of these bodies, and violent utterances have been numerous, The leaders regard the movement as a means to attract to the revolutionary cause persons whom its propaganda would not normally reach, and who would attend a &quot;Church&quot; service but not a Socialist meeting..Intellectually the movement is feeble in the extreme. Except as mob orators its leaders show little knowledge and small ability ; they deal out history of the usual biassed and inaccurate sort, and their ignorance is colossal ; they can call a &quot; workman&quot; or &quot; peasant&quot; a &quot; Soviet,&quot; and &quot; self-determination&quot; to some of them means &quot; resolutions.&quot;A book entitled &quot;The New Christianity, or the Religion of the New Age,&quot; has been published by the Rev. Salem Bland, of Toronto. It is likely to appeal to ill-educated enthusiasts, appearing, as it does, to invest the selfish and extreme phases of the revolutionary movement with the odour of religion.   It may prove dangerous.Miscellaneous.A statement made by Sir George Foster, the Dominion Minister of Trade and Commerce, in the House of Commons, establishes the fact that there are no restrictions upon Canadian trade with Russia. There is a report that Russia is to purchase agricultural and railway equipment and other supplies in canada for an amount stated to be in excess of 5,000,000 dollars.The Russian Soviet Government Commercial Bureau is to be opened in Canada with the official sanction of the Dominion Government. Martens states that satisfactory arrangements have been made for the transfer of 10,000,000 dollars in gold to Canada for the purchase of
Canadian goods. The gold is to be shipped via Esthonia or taken from &quot;that deposited in Scandinavian banks.The exodus of Austrians from Ontario has been checked to a great extent, owing to the unfavourable accounts of the bad conditions in Austria received from Austrians who have already returned there.British Columbia.The May Day demonstration. at Cumberland, British Columbia, collapsed before an important football match.The mining companies of Cobalt aud neighbouring places are making considerable concessions to their employees. The men are paid a specified wage plus a bonus calculated on the price of silver, according to a sliding scale. At present their bonus amounts to 125 dollars a day (? 1.25 dollars). The price of silver is falling and normally the bonus would decline ; but the companies guarantee a continuance for six months, beginning with the month of May. This concession will, it is hoped, stop the evacuation of mine workers from the district.Unemployment in British Columbia.Industrial expansion has -been disappointing in Victoria and Vancouver, where approximately 1,800 men are still unemployed. Many of these are returned men who still hope to find work at home, and who, until they can be made to realise that the resources of the city are in-sufficient to provide for them and the constant influx, cannot be induced to leave.Labour leaders are constantly trying to stir up the men against the Government, whom they hold responsible for the high cost of living, and the non-fulfilment of promises held out to these men while overseas.AUSTRALIA.The revolutionary movement in Australia appears to be smothered by its own excess of organisers. As is frequently the case, the One Big Union is causing a split in the labour ranks which is prejudicial to their political influence. Underground attempts are being made to reduce the gap between the political and direct action sections of the Australian Labour Party. Bolshevist literature is arriving in Australia from other countries, the Socialist papers inserting many of the more militant articles from the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;A Bill is to be introduced providing machinery for special tribunals rather like the Whitley Councils, and composed of an equal number of employers and employees with a Government or independent chairman. These tribunals will control industries. The revolt against the Federal Arbitration Court has been a great cause of labour disputes. The Coal Miners&apos; Federation has threatened to strike soon if the Government does not appoint a commission of inquiry for the whole industry. A desire for socialisation is certainly behind this movement.The New South Wales collieries have rejected the proprietors&apos; offer of a minimum daily wage of 14*. 6d.The Labour Party in the Victoria Legislative Assembly have accused the Government of taking sides in the gas strike,A letter from the Chairman of the Lambeth Housing Board to the Sydney Labour Council, published in the Sydney papers, approved the Councils decision not to participate in the welcome to the Prince of Wales, alleging that the Duchy of Cornwall Estate, from which the Prince&apos;s income is chiefly derived, contains slums in a disgraceful
condition, and that the tenants can obtain no redress. This letter, it may be noted, was Avritten by a rejected applicant for the post of foreman at the Duchy of Cornwall Works Department. It was obviously prompted by personal resentment.Western Australia.Western Australia has been all but paralysed by the strike of 3,000 Civil Servants, including teachers and Savings Bank employees ; 500 schools and 60 branches of the banks are closed. It is feared that the strike may extend to all other workers. The salaries of Civil Servants have been increased by the Queensland Arbitration Court. Fremantle lumpers&apos; (dock labourers) and carters&apos; unions have declared ^Government goods &quot; black,&quot; a decision which will affect the State shipping and saw mills.New Zealand.Father Moore, an ardent Sinn Feiner, has just visited Wellington for the purpose of initiating seditious propaganda in New Zealand. He - intends to leave for Australia at the end of July for the same purpose.Two Indian agitators have also turned their attentions to New Zealand, the barrister, D. M. Manilal, and his wife, who were some of the chief leaders in the recent Indian disturbances in Fiji, and have left that colony in consequence. The New Zealand Government rather contemptuously allowed them to land at Auckland. The number of Indians in New Zealand is small, and the Government can deport them at will.SOUTH AFRICA.Racial Antagonism.The situation generally is disquieting. The racial feeling between the Dutch and British is again acute. Judge Hertzog, at the head of the Nationalist Party, although very careful in his public utterances, is reported to be doing grim work behind the scenes amongst the Dutch farmers. Men Avho took part in the overturn of 1914 are now allowed to become Nationalist candidates, and are elected by great majorities; GeneralKempl (Avho joined Mariiz. Bever. and tne others in the abortive revolution) is now a Member of Parliament representing a large constituency.Nationalists were very bitter against England during the recent elections; an acrimonious neAVspaper controversy between Colonel Greene, of Natal, and General Smuts made a Coalition impossible. The elections Avere fought on strong racial lines, and the Nationalists gained a majority.The Labour Party.In the last Parliament the Labour Party consisted of five member s led by Colonel Cresswell, who strongly favours maintenance of the Union. During the election, however, men of extreme socialistic views began to exercise power in some electorates. The extremists are now led by a man named Kentridge, of Polish origin, and of strong, almost Bolshevist, views. (Two-thirds of the Jews of South Africa, and all the Rabbis, are of Polish origin.) A clever speaker and parliamentarian, in the election he ousted one of the most popular men on the Rand.The extreme Labour faction did not disguise their antipathy to constituted government, and Avere most successful when pitted against the British Party, whom they represented as capitalists.   At Johannes-burg the Bolshevists held a croAvded meeting and made inflammatory
5.and much applauded speeches against the existing order. The following day one of the leading papers devoted a column and a half, in addition to a leading article, to a report on the meeting, including some of the worst statements of the speakers. The Labour Party now numbers 21 members and, although.Colonel Cresswell is nominally the leader, the extreme faction is really the powerful factor of the party.Rhodesians voted dead against the Chartered Company&apos;s candidates and won. The leaders have no thought of entering the Union of South Africa. Nothing is further from their thoughts. There is, however, much talk of a Union being formed under a new British centralised government of British East Africa, German East Africa, and Northern Rhodesia, including Nyasaland and the Lake centres.The Native Question.When the Bill for giving the Natives a voice in the government (see June number) comes to its critical stages it will probably be opposed both by the Dutch farmers and the Natalians, and may go under.Whilst the white man quarrels the Native grows menacing. He is the real labour man of South Africa. The Labour Party are beginning to. realise this ; Cape Colony unions are already extending their scope so as to admit coloured labour and white labour on the same level. They may go further than this and include also the&apos; Natives. This would give tremendous power, and, for the safety of the State, it might be better that they should organise in this way than that the Natives should organise amongst themselves. There is evidently - strong hatred rising amongst the Natives towards the whites. Once this hatred was merely directed towards the Dutch now it is against all whites. The Ethiopian movement, although not much in the public eye, is still at work. It has been driven underground, but its power is spreading all over South, East, and West Africa. The Natives, in the midst of the election, struck for more wages and came out. They were under contract, and the military were ordered in and compelled them to return to work. But they returned in a sullen, disgruntled mood, and have made up their minds that, in future, they will be wary of contract labour. They resent the legislation that discriminates against them as a race. The &quot; Pass System &quot; now in operation compels them to be in at a certain time, unless they can produce a chit from an employer giving them permission to stay out. The coloured man from Cape Colony, although he may be as black in the skin as they are themselves, does not come under this liability. Again, in respect to liquor; they are forbidden the canteens, their native beer in the corn-pounds must not contain more than 2\ per cent, of alcohol, whereas the Cape Colony coloured man and Indian coolie can have as much drink as he likes. Again, as to land tenure; they are given land, and then, on the slightest pretext, are edged off on to inferior land if what they hold is wanted by white men.In Natal the sugar-growers are pushing their way far into the old Zulu country, where Zulus are now under notice to vacate the heritage of generations of their progenitors. The Zulu works for the sugar planter at a wage that is for such labour, perhaps, the lowest in the world. In some places it is only Is. a day, in others it may rise to Is. 6d. When the Zulu protests he is told that the coolie will do it for even less. As there are 120,000 Indians in Natal, many in extreme poverty, and only too glad to take up work of any kind to stave off hunger, the Zulu is not ouly dispossessed of his land, but is also deprived, in too many instances, of a means of livelihood.
In the old days it was the great aim of the white people to conciliate the Natives and to create a spirit of good feeling amongst them. This general, instinctive policy is a thing of the past. The Native, no longer ignorant of his power, holds the key of the whole situation. When he acts, it will probably not be to make trouble, but rather by a withholding, a passive resistance in boycott of the whites, Avhich would spell ruin to South Africa.The Lovedale Institution in Kaffraria, whose general expenses have been borne by the Church of Scotland, has been doiug excellent work for the education and improvement of the Natives for nearly 50 years. Owing to the failure of the wheat crop in Kaffraria this year, the masters proposed to the students that they should put a little maize meal in with the wheat flour in making the bread. The students rose against this pro-position, either genuinely or seizing an excuse to rebel. Hoisting the Red Flag and singing socialist songs, they broke into the Institution buildings, and before help could be got they had damaged those buildings to the extent of thousauds of pounds. Expostulating masters were stoned and beaten out of their senses. The strange thing was that the majority of these students came from Khama&apos;s country, probably the most Christianised Native State in Africa. All received terms of imprisonment, but the impression of alarm in South Africa remains.EAST AFRICA.Indians in British East Africa are protesting against the colour bar which debars Indians from suffrage privileges and from all representation in the Administration. At present they are not allowed to buy land or even to live in some parts of the country.WEST INDIES. Trinidad.Racial Agitation.Labour agitation is not serious, and would not normally lead to disorders necessitating the presence of H.M. ships; racial agitation, on the other hand, is dangerous and may lead to serious rioting and disorder. The Negn/s receptive mind is fertile soil for the seed of the agitator. There is evidence of considerable racial feeling in Trinidad and St. Lucia, where trouble has already occurred, and to a less extent in Dominica and Barbadoes. Sedition and race hatred are propagated by paid agitators (frequently men of the worst type),, newspapers and pamphlets, while labour grievances are exploited for what they are worth. Fortunately there is little co-ordination between the sedition-mongers in different islands, and the possibility of a general uprising of blacks against the whites still appears remote.There is no doubt that various secret Friendly Societies, which have been in existence for some years, are at the bottom of the Negro movement. Ostensibly established to promote the welfare of the Negro and to inculcate racial equality with the whites, some of these Negro Societies are, in fact, attempting to propagate sedition and social dis-content, whilst others, themselves harmless, cloak the work of the extremists. The agitation comes from Marcus Garvey&apos;s Negro Improve-meut Association in New York. The importation of its organ, the &quot; Negro World,&quot; has been prohibited in some of the islands. In others the opinion is that its suppression would do more harm than good.
Sedition is also spread by the members of the Workingmen&apos;s Associa-tion, who urge the joys of freedom from white control. Gunpowder fuses and detonators are constantly stolen from the Government quarry. Rumour speaks of bombs. The Association has now about 6,000 members, and goes on recruiting new blood by petty terrorism, flogging, &amp;c, and even by threats of death.The Position of Labour.On the whole, in the different colonies, the Labour situation is satisfactory. In the country districts labourers are earning high wages. Wages in the towns have been increased by strike and threat to 125 per cent, above pre-war rates. Hours have been reduced by 20 per cent, during the same period, so that the actual cost to the employer is much more. But the one serious source of danger at the moment is unskilled labour.In Barbadoes and Dominica, although racial agitation does not appear to exist, the country labourer is under-paid and has a legitimate grievance for agitators to exploit. Two of these, Sidney de Bourg and Bruce McConney, have been deported, and the Rev. E. Seiler Salmon has been told to go. Returned soldiers of the B.W.I. regiment are. lazy and frequently anti-white.&apos; Repatriated seamen from British ports, on the other hand, are loyal to Britain and only anxious to follow their calling. Many of these have consequently secured employment.The police, though to some extent infected by racial propaganda, can for the most part be relied upon to deal with local disorders. Members of the force are joining the Workingmen&apos;s Association, not through any feeling of disloyalty, but because their pay is poor and they receive disablement bonuses from the societies in case of illness, whereas the Police Force, when they are ill, is said to dock their pay by 50 per cent. To counteract this disaffection the Government suggests starting a Friendly Society for the benefit of members of the Police Force only ; , while, on the other hand, extending the regulations which forbid members of the force joining a secret society to Friendly Societies also.9. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Extremists.-A campaign of disruption in Europe has been planned by the Industrial Workers of the World, the moving spirit being William D. (Big Bill) Haywood. Thousands of letters signed by Haywood have been sent to carefully prepared lists of workers in England, France, Germany, and Italy. The Industrial Workers of the World wish to persuade the workers to (1) Prevent people leaving for the United States for the time being&quot;thus depriving the American capitalists of labour power which creates their wealth.&quot; (2) Strike on all commercial vessels from the United States loadingor unloading goods in their countries. (3) Strike against serving or guiding Americans travelling in their countries and to &quot;call their attention to the infamies andpersecutions suffered by the members of the Industrial workers of the World, in the United States.&quot; (4) Refrain from purchasing anything made in America or shipped from America.The cable which announced that the Socialist Party Convention had decided to re-affirm its allegiance to the Second International was sent in
error. As a matter of fact the Convention had re-affirmed affiliation to the Third International.Communists.At the National Convention the Communist Labour Party and the Communist Party amalgamated, the new Party being called the United Communist. This Party has been joined by the faction headed by Ruttenberg and Ferguson, and also by many of the groups headed by Hourwieh. The Convention on a vote decided to unite with the Industrial Workers of the World subject to the latter accepting the Dictatorship of the proletariat.At the Second, or District Convention, the delegates were instr ucted to vote for &quot;Mass Action&quot; as opposed to &quot;Direct Action&quot; &quot;Mass Action&quot; being defined as street fights, &amp;e., in case of a revolution or disturbances. This plan has been adopted by the National Convention, and a clause embodying it will be drawn up for the new manifesto. A good deal of disturbance has been caused through the decision of the entire Party to go underground. More than half of the Communist Labour Party of New York City have seceded from the Party.Labour is seeking to establish a. third party which is to include a committee of 48, an, organisation of middle-class Liberals ; the American Labour Party, which is the Left Wing of organised labour, and certain representatives of the Farmers&apos; Non-Partisan League. The dominating influence appears to be the Labour Party. If the farmers at Chicago represent the very strong Non-Partisan League in the north-west, and if the Labour Party maintains its strength, the new party may well have an important effect on the national election.The Japanese Invasion.The Japanese question threatens to become very serious indeed. Many Japanese women have come to California recently, and the birth rate among them is higher than among whites. The Japanese population, which 20 years ago was merely nominal, is now a little over 87,000. The friction between the Japanese and the white population is agrarian rather than industrial. Californians declare that white farmers cannot survive in competition with the Japanese owing to their lower standard of living and their Oriental frugality and perseverance.During the recent Democratic Convention in San Francisco, a letter was addressed to Secretary Colby asking for diplomatic negotiations with Japan, or a strict Exclusiou Act, in order to forestall the approaching crisis. Feeling on the Pacific coast is rising and is rooted in the mass of the population.   Special financial interests have nothing to do with it.Negro Agitation.A great conspiracy, organised in Moscow, to spread Bolshevism among the Negroes of America, has been discovered by the United States authorities. A special emissary named Malkin, disguised as a sailor, is said to have brought funds in diamonds from Russia to finance it.Negroes, parading in support of the back to Africa movement, recently burnt the United States flag in the streets of Chicago. White spectators broke in upon the demonstration, and a fierce riot, with many casualties, ensued.Sinn Fein Activities.On 2nd June the British flag was publicly burned on the sidewalk before the Treasury Building, Washington ; the same party invaded Congress the day before with shouts for Irish independence.
These disturbances were organised by Dr. Tom Malone and Jeremiah 0&apos;Leary. The latter is in charge of the case of Jim Larkin, who has been imprisoned for criminal anarchy.Dr. McCarten has just returned from a secret mission to Ireland, where he did constructive work for Larkin. He is a member of the Irish Progressive League and Friends of Irish Freedom, and very influential among the entire Irish group. He intends to return to Ireland shortly disguised as a fireman.A short sketch of Larkin&apos;s life is to be used for propaganda purposes. It was, however, decided to suppress the fact that Larkiu went to America in 1914 as a messenger from the Irish Transport Union and the Citizens&apos; Army to raise money with which to purchase arms for Ireland from Hamburg, which he imported by an &quot;underground&quot; passage known to him alone, a process which is now said to have taken two years.Frank P. Walsh was chosen by Dr. McCarten to continue the defence of Jim Larkiu, and was to be coached by De Valera,, but Larkiu with-drew his consent on becoming aware that all three men were using his case to further their own political purposes, and that De Valera&apos;s motive really was that he could not return to Ireland unless something had been done for Larkin.It is possible that the Federal Authorities may review his case and -decide to deport him.. The President of the James &quot;Connolley Club, - Boston, Walter McCarthy, is reported to be by birth a German ; his real name is Berk-hardt. Colvin, who is associated with him, is also said to be German, his real name being Solles. These two agitators are preparing to leave New York for Ireland in the near future. They are both members of the Larkin Defence Committee.De Valera&apos;s Movements.De Valera has made arrangements to visit Brazil and the Argentine. His present purpose is to sail for Ireland early in September from Rio de Janeiro. He is bringing out a &quot; Red Book,&quot; which is to be published by the Irish &quot; Republic,&quot; which professes to show the actual conditions in Ireland, and charges the British Government and officials with murder and crimes innumerable.It was decided at a crowded meeting of the Irish Progressive League to-repudiate the statements of certain politicians who accused de Valera of misappropriating funds, and to prevent them from driving de Valera out of the country.The Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist Churches have denounced American interference in British domestic affairs. Yale and Harvard Universities have also sent protests to Washington. In order not to offend the great body of voters represented, the Democratic Convention was obliged to exercise great care in wording their statement regarding Ireland. After expressing sympathy with the aspirations of the Irish people for self-government, the Convention only pledged itself, &quot; to such action as is consistent with international comity and usage.&quot;Mian Agitators and Sinn Fein.Irishmen in the United States are reported to be planning a revolt against England on a large scale in September, in which Ireland, Canada, Egypt, India, and Persia are to take part. It will be financed by the Irish-Americans, and is no doubt connected with the reported treaty made by the Nationalist revolutionaries of various countries against Great Britain at Moscow.   The Russian Soviet Government is said to
be represented in New York by a Mr. Knudsen (probably a Scandinavian), who, in turn, represents Professor Nicolai of Hamburg.De Valera has presented a large photograph of himself to the Friends of Freedom for India, while they, on their side, are appealing for funds &quot;to provide for the salaries of a Minister and Consuls to the Republic of Ireland.&quot;Basanta Koomar Roy, the Indian agitator, is endeavouring to find an &quot; underground passage to Russia,&quot; and is calling on the Soviet Bureau for help.German Activities.Dr. Joseph Bloch, the former editor and publisher of an Austrian weekly, has just returned from a trip to Austria and Germany, and is trying to promote cordiality between those countries and America. He considers it important that a strong political machine should be formed in America. This idea is at the back of the great drive for Relief of the Distressed in Austria and Germany, which was not as successful as the originators hoped, in spite of the efficient help of the Irish ladies. Only&apos; about half a million dollars were subscribed. The President, however, claims that&quot;the drive has brought the Germans closer together again, and shown that they can become a political power if they remain united.The German &quot; Turn VdVein &quot; are taking an important part in this movement to unite all German-Americans, Avho will work mostly under, cover, not as German-American citizens, but as American citizens. A great Bundes Turnfest is to be held at the end of June 1921, and a large field on the Chicago River has already been rented and preparations begun. The German character of the big national celebration is to be camouflaged by inviting American Athletic Societies to participate,The &quot; Freimaurer Bund Amerika,&quot; an alliance organised last year by the German Freemasons, held its first congress at the end of June ; almost every German masonic lodge uoav belongs to it.The German-American Alliance has pledged itself to achieve a revision of the text-books and histories used in the public schools. They intend to gain political power in order to get laws enacted for a thorough revision of the anglicised text-books of the schools, and, as they say, make them real American text-books which will give due credit to Germany and the achievement of the Germans iu America.Miscellaneous.The State Department has reaffirmed the attitude of the united States towards the question of the Soviet Government, which it denounces as &quot; minority despotism.&quot; It is, however, willing to issue, through the War Trade Board, licences for shipment of all materials, except those &quot; susceptible of immediate use for war purposes,&quot; but merchants engaging in trade with Russia must do so at their own risk. The United States Postal Department will not accept letters or parcels for delivery in Russia, and the State Department will not issue passports for Russia.Ludwig Martens, whose exchequer is sorely depleted, has promised to pay 50,000 dollars to the newly-formed Committee of prominent Liberal lawyers who are attacking Mitchell Palmer for his stand against the Bolsheviks. It is believed that the Soviet Authorities in Russia are dissatisfied with Martens and that he may be recalled. Martens&apos; principal lieutenant, a Finnish Communist named Santeri Nuorteva, came to London lately to obtain definite information from Krassin regarding the latter&apos;s American policy and to obtain funds from Krassin. In order to have a plausible excuse for the journey Nuorteva went first
to Canadian merchants with promises of remunerative Russian business. He landed at Liverpool with a &quot; diplomatic &quot; passport signed by Martens, which was inadvertently stamped by the landing officer, aud went to stay with Ewer, the Foreign editor of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; in London. His status in this country was, however, entirely irregular, and in view of his previous activities a deportation order was made against him. He chose the route Copenhagen-Reval, avoiding the country of his birth, where he said, he would have incurred a death sentence, and he left on 26th July.10. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE.Strikes.Buenos Aires has a strike for every day on the calendar. There were 375 during the year; an increase of 117. Of these, 363 were settled, while the year ended with 14 in progress.The 18 agitators in the strike of the Forestal Land Company pre-viously referred to (see Report No. 18) have been released for political reasons it is supposed -through the intervention of the Presidential Party  but will not be reinstated in the Company.Revolutionary and Strike-breaking Devices.An interesting experiment has been started in Buenos Aires by the head of Thompsons Furniture Company, Limited, to counter strikes and labour problems. In exchange for a workman&apos;s bonus of 2 per cent, of the cost value of all work produced in the factory, the members of the Centurions&apos; Society, as it has been named, have undertaken to assist and influence the workmen in increasing the production, and to back the managers in matters of discipline. Since the inauguration of the Society, in October last, the factory production increased 15 per cent, the first mouth, 25 per cent, the third, and at present the increase is 100 per cent, over the pre-scheme figures. The employees have made no demands or trouble since the scheme started. The Centurions, all Com-pany&apos;s employees, are limited to 100 members, selected in the first instance by the Company. Vacancies are filled by vote of a general meeting of workmen. Their services are honorary. Under the present arrangement no strike demands will be presented, or propaganda in favour of workmen&apos;s societies permitted. Funds payable to the Centurions by their employers are handed over monthly, and distributed by them amongst the workmen, according to the resolutions of their general monthly meetings. Workmen have free access to the account books, and should the Society be dissolved, funds will be equally distributed among them.The Association of Newspaper Proprietors and Printing Establish-raents, which was formed about the same time as the Association del Trabajo (see June number) to fight strikes, consists of all the principal newspapers and 38 printing works. In 1919 the masters granted increase of pay, but refused to consider the meu&apos;s demands of a 7^-hour day and recognition of the men&apos;s society (the Federacion de Artes Graficas), and in order to break the strike the Association discharged 3,500 men, all the newspapers ceasing publication for 15 days in consequence. The &quot; Federation&quot; men were replaced by free labour drawn from Uruguay and the provinces, and the discharged men, who were black-listed, have not been re-employed by any members of the &quot; Association.&quot; The masters established schools to train men for all branches of printing; .
all their labour is now drawn from that source, and there has been no further trouble.The &quot; Liga Patriotica Argentina &quot; in the Argentine is in touch with the &quot; Ligue Civique &quot; in Paris. When the &quot; Liga Patriotica &quot; was first organised a large number of naval and military officers, N.C.O.&apos;s, privates, and conscripts joined, so as to help the League with their experience of organisation details. Within a week orders were issued by the Admiralty and the War Office that all those who joined the Society were to resign within 48 hours, the President evidently fearing that the League might be used for political purposes against himself.German Emigration.The strong propaganda in favour of emigration to the Argentine, which is still being carried on in Germany, is difficult to understand in view of the opinions cabled to Berlin by leading Germans in the Argen-tine (see June number). Not only is a knowledge of Spanish absolutely essential for any responsible position, but also the feeling towards Germany is so unfavourable that many Germans have been dismissed from their posts simply on account of their nationality. Although the Argentine was neutral during the war, its sympathies were entirely with the French, to whom, rather than to England, Argentine sympathy is devoted.Miscellaneous.Chauffeurs, belonging to the Chauffeurs&apos;&apos;Unioii, demand a commission on all cars sold in the Argentine by agents of foreign firms. If refused, they so manipulate the engines and fittings as to discredit the car in the owner&apos;s estimation.No interest is shown in the Irish question even by Irish settlers, whose personal affairs absorb them. The two British dailies evince no sympathy with the &quot; Irish Republic.&quot;BOLIVIA.The President and the Ministers in Bolivia have been seized by revolutionaries. The leader of the Republican Party, Senor Baptista Saavedra, organised the movement which led to the overthrow of the Government.MEXICO.The Mexican Foreign Office has instructed all Mexican Consuls in the United States and Europe to refuse to vise passports of &quot; agitators and Radicals of whatever nationality who intend to visit Mexico.&quot;A strike of factory workers in Cocula was broken recently by the women in that section, who went into the factories and ran the machinery until the men decided to surrender and go back to work. The same thing happened in the big Orizaba strike not long ago. The One Big Union is now organising a campaign to &quot; educate &quot; the women workers of Mexico.The report that the Moscow Internationale is to establish its head-quarters in Mexico for the dissemination of Bolshevik propaganda throughout North and South America is now definitely confirmed, &quot;it is stated that the establishment of the Latin American branch of the Internationale organisation at Moscow will be in Mexico City which is
to be the centre of Bolshevik activities for the whole American continent. The chief of this group is said to be a Russian, named Rosenberg, who, in Jcompany with other Bolshevik agents, is now en route to Moscow to obtain from that Government 10,000,000 dollars to ferment a Bolshevik movement on the American continent.Bolshevik aclivities are reportsd in industrial centres of Mexico, particularly in the State of Sonora in Orizaba and the Vera Cruz region. Sonora is said to be particularly well organised and there has apparently been little official repression of the pernicious activities of these agitators.O 11837E
66 PART II.1.-THE STATE AND PROSPECTS OP RELIGION IN SOVIET RUSSIA.(&quot; The following article is by the British author oj the article on page 53 of our June Report&quot; -who has recently returned from Soviet Russia.)During my residence in Moscow I visited the Patriarch, Tikhon, at his palace. I was first met by one of his clergy who warned me that the Patriarch was under &quot;house arrest&quot; and not supposed to see anyone without authorisation. I Avas also given to understand that I Avould run some risk myself as I Avould have to sign my name in a book which had to be submitted aftenvards to the Extraordinary Commission.1 signed my name, hoAvever, and Avas soon aftenvards ushered into the presence of the Patriarch, avIio certainly lives in comfortable surroundings, having the whole place to himself and his small entourage of clergy and servants. None of the furniture, pictures, ikons, &amp;c, iu the spacious halls have been disturbed, and the whole place is kept in good condition. Tikhon Avore the gorgeous dress of a Russian Patriarch, and he received me with simple-dignity. He is a tall man of about sixty with shrewd grey eyes and a florid, healthy face, the face of a peasant. In the subsequent conversation he struck me as simple in the ways of the world, but fearless and sincere. He is as different from, say, Cardinal Mercier, as the Orthodox Church is different from the Roman. The latter has a powerful organisation and possesses among its higher ecclesiastics cultured men Avith trained minds and great diplomatic ability. The former is in a more primitive stage, and its long connection with the State has atrophied it. Cardinal Mercier is a highly educated mau Avith Latin energy and initiative. Patriarch Tikhon is a pious, unsophisticated man with a considerable knowledge of Russian theological literature and with more than a touch of Russian, fatalism and apathy. Although he lived for several jears in America and Alaska, visiting Russian congregations there, he must have lived in monasteries all the time. For he knows nothing of American conditions and has only picked up one Avord of English. He is capable of being a martyr, but incapable of inaugurating and carrying on an active anti-Bolshevist movement. He told me of the encyclical in which he had cursed the Bolshevists, and remarked, with a chuckle, that the latter Avere very annoyed about it and had complained to him that Denikin&apos;s troops were using it very exten-sively as propaganda and had pasted it up on all the walls in Tombov and other towns. I told him that Koltchak had used it in the same way, and this intelligence seemed to gratify him. But I do not think that he will write any more encyclicals, being apparently satisfied that he has done all he can and that the rest is in the hands of Gilod. On the other hand, the Bolshevists are not likely to trouble him so long as he keeps quiet.He approved of the separation of Church and State, but complained that, though the Church had lost Government help, the Government continued to interfere in its internal affairs. About sixty bishops and several hundred priests had been put to death. The Communists made it impossible for him to get accurate statistics. It was difficult for any ecclesiastic to get a permit to travel, with the result that diocesan visitations had been pretermitted, many churches left without a pastor,
and the whole ecclesiastical machinery stopped. It was even impossible to communicate by letter, but probably some of these difficulties are due to a disorganised transport service and not specially created for the persecution of the Church.There was little altar wine left and little oil. The Patriarch wanted to know if I could get these for him from England. He was anxious to know my religion, being apparently afraid of Jews visiting him. All the Church&apos;s printing presses and paper had been confiscated, and this made the publication of religious works or periodicals impossible. All meetings of ecclesiastical Councils are also impossible. It is doubtful if they will be allowed in the future. Common action among the leaders of the Russian Church is impossible.The position of the Patriarch is pathetic, and also the position of the clergy, who are now dependent entirely for support on their parishioners. If the latter do not want a particular priest or any priest at all in their&apos; villages, they need only refuse their offerings. The result will be an entire change in the status of the clergyman, who, in anycase, was never very much venerated by the villagers. That status will be lower, I think, henceforward ; for the clergyman will be an expensive luxury, and the higher ecclesiastical authorities will cease to have any hold on him. He will tend to become a mere tool in the hands of the dominant faction in his parish. The peasants, at least, will not dispense with him. He will be useful at the blessing of the crops and other functions to which the muzhiks attach a superstitious importance. But, even under the Tzars, the parish priest was generally regarded as a man who had&apos; his own trade like a cobbler or a carpenter and was not expected to take an interest in the social and moral life of the people like the English or- French clergyman. Nor did he in fact take any such interest, When he had finished reading his Mass or performing some other religious service, he went home to his family without thinking that he had any&apos; other obligations towards society at large than a mechanic who had done a piece of work and been paid for it.Bishop Anthony of Ufa tried to interest Kolchak in a scheme for making the clergy take an interest in social and educational work as the clergy do in the Western churches, but this scheme was never carried into execution. The fact that the priest is, as a rule, only a peasant himself, uueducated, and sometimes addicted to drink, would tell against its success. In one village in Vologda Province where I lived before the war the muzhiks complained to me of a parish priest who beat his wife and got so drunk on Saturday night that they sometimes had to pull him out of bed on Sunday morning in order that he might say Massfor them.The Patriarch told me that there are now no candidates for the priesthood and that all the ecclesiastical seminaries are closed. The net result will probably be the downfall of the Russian Church and the formation of a great number of small sects, some of them probably of a very strange character. The Old Believers among the Cossacks will probably become stronger and so will the Baptists, the largest Protestant sect in Russia, but a throwback towards old and fantastic heresies is more likely than an advance on the modern religious lines of the west. The Communists will probably have trouble with the sporadic religious outbreaks. But these outbreaks will be accompanied by such massacres of Jews and by the preaching of doctrines so impossible that Europe will find it difficult to sympathise with them. The Bolshevists have confessed to me that they are nervous on the subject of religion and that they must go slow. A Russian gentleman who distinguished himself before the war by his strongly anti-alcohol views, recently started some
sort of religious revival in Peteograd. The Bolshevists promptly put him in jail, and the movement ceased.The most formidable enemy of Bolshevism among the religious bodies in Russia is the other International, the Roman Catholic Church. This Church possesses in every Russian and Siberian town large and very earnest congregations composed chiefly of Poles and Lithuanians, and in no case that came under my observation has the priest deserted his flock or discontinued to hold daily services, which are always well attended by men as well as by women. There has been no interference on the part of the Bolshevists with these Roman Catholic communities save that their schools have been closed, their school books and libraries confiscated, and their children forced to attend Communist schools. One of their prelates, Bishop Ropp, has been imprisoned, but he was probably too outspoken and aggressive, for the Government of the late Tzar once exiled him from his See and from Russia owing to the high tone he took with them. There were also arrests of Catholics in Petrograd, some three months ago, owing to religious processions of protest against several Bolshevist measures having been organised by the congregation of St. Catherine^ Church on the Nevsky Prospect. In Little Russia the Uniate Church, which is recognised by Rome, will probably gain in membership, and a large number of Lithuanians who had been forced by the old Imperial Government to register themselves as Orthodox, will now profess Roman Catholicism openly.The Catholic Church in Russia is powerful, well organised and solid against Bolshevism, for no Catholic can be a Bolshevist, but owing to the fact that it is mainly Polish, there is a national prejudice against it in Russia, and it will consequently have no effect on the general situation. Rome, too, is behaving with her usual prudence in this matter. She is taking no steps against Bolshevism, being probably afraid of exposing her followers in Russia to persecution.The standard of education and general culture among the Roman Catholic clergy in Russia is much higher than that which prevails among the Orthodox clergy, hence the machinery of the Catholic Church is able to function much as usual, despite the fact that it is exposed to the same lack of communication as has paralysed the Russian Church. Among the Polish clergy are some very remarkable men, speaking four or five European languages besides their own, and accustomed to move in the highest circles of the Vatican. They are inclined to take little or no interest, however, in the conversion of the Russians, whom they regard with contempt as an inferior race, and their precise Latin training makes them averse to any compromise with the laxer and more florid system of the Oriental Church. A Galician prelate who is also a Prince, a litterateur, a theologian, and a publicist of somewhat similar stamp to Cardinal Newman in this country, has made it his life work, however, to persuade all Russians to enter the Uniate Church, and the lifting of the Tzarist ban on the residence of Catholic regular clergy in Russia may result in his obtaining able assistants from the heads of the religious congregations in Rome. In the present turmoil he can, however, do nothing.Meanwhile, the schools, school books, libraries, &amp;c., of the Orthodox Clergy have been all taken over by the State, and all the children in the country of both sexes and of every race and religion are taught together in Communist schools. This education is also conducted with enthusiasm, and will, if continued, reduce very much the percentage of &quot;illiteracy in Russia. It is, however, essentially anti-religious and. inculcates that anti-national class hatred which is the first principle of the Bolshevists.  A
generation of this teaching will overthrow every religion in Russia, and convert the country into a factory of High Explosives, in the raeta-physical sense, which will make it a danger to the whole World.2.-AGRARIAN CONDITIONS IN SOVIET RUSSIA AND THE .  BUREAU FOR THE ELECTRIFICATION OF AGRICULTURE.&quot; One ought not to ignore the enormous work of economic recon-struction which has been performed in Russia .... What has there happened, for example, in regard to the problem of unification of the sources of power gives proof of a power ivhich is exemplary.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Dr. Simorfs speech to the Reichstag on July 26th, 1920.The following extracts from a general statement of what the Bolshevist theorists have done with the vast resources of the Russian lands, how they have exhausted these resources, and how they propose to begin the recuperative process are by a patriotic Russian landowner, Mr. Juvenal Maximoff, late head of the Economic Section for the Electrification of Rural Industries of the National Commissariat of Agriculture of the Soviet Republic. Mr. MaximofF escaped from Bolshevist Russia in February 1920, crossed the Polish-Russian frontier and wrote his report in the office of Mr. Louis E. Van Norman, American Trade Commissioner, Warsaw, who has submitted his figures aud observations to every test available and has found them beyond challenge.The Bolsheviks have been carrying out a great scheme for the electrification of factories, transport and villages, and have set up a Bureau for the Electrification of Agriculture, to which hundreds of millions of roubles are being devoted.Able Russian electrical engineers employed on the scheme- admit on all hands that it is premature. It certainly meaus, as will appear below, that, if anything comes of it the newly won de facto independence of the Russian peasant will be subdued into something resembling the old serfdom.Mr. Juvenal MaximofTs standpoint is that Russia cannot save herself. He sees only two alternatives of salvation for her : help from Germany or help from America. The present regime, so far from saving her, is only completing her ruin, the responsibility for which, according to him, originated with Victor Tchernoff and the social revolutionaries. German , help, the specific of Krassin, means German economic domination. America is more distant; his appeal is to her.Mr. MaximofF professes to have won over to his views an influential section of the Soviet Government. He even claims to speak in their name. &quot; The actual Government,&quot; he says, will gladly &quot; give the concession of these territories to the United States of &quot; America, because of all the countries only the United States do not &quot; make any politics within Russia, and the concern, if established by &quot; the United States, will be purely commercial .... the Bureau &quot; (for the electrification of Rural Industries, of which Mr. Maximoff was the &quot; head) had some indications that in respect of the electrified farms many &quot; deviations from orthodox socialism will be allowed, due to the absolute &quot; necessity to establish and to run on the proper lines such farms.&quot;The following are condensed excerpts from this curious document. The thesis which they are intended to support is shortly, that Russian small ownership can never be productive and must be abolished, that the supply and control of mechanical power must be centralised as a step to the regeneration of the industries, transport, and agriculture both of
Northern Russia, &quot;the territories with too moisty a climate,&quot; and of South-east Russia, where the running of the big farms will be most profitable of all.Electrification.To electrify Russia seems pretentious talk, but is really far easier than the regeneration of Russia by the unpretentious old horse teams and ruined steam plants of our works and factories. The calculations of the Board of Animal Industry show that at best we will have in 1964 the same number of horse teams as in 1913, whilst the population will be about 30 per cent. more. That means that in 1964 wre will under-produce 15 per cent, of agricultural products as compared with 1913. The other 15 per cent, will fail us owing to the non-exportation of these products while in the meantime both ourselves and Europe will starve.The old school of farming and agriculture cannot yet understand that after the Revolution labour will be very dear, and that better devices must now be thought out. It cannot yet grasp the meaning of the destruction, and reasons as if we had as many horses as before the war. This opposition has now, however, been brought to an end and the College is now in favour of the mechanisation of farming and agriculture.The revolutionary propaganda of Victor Tchernoff and others, and the agitation of the Bolsheviks for a class war have produced one result; the separation of the villages from the towns. Things in the Soviet Republic move in a vicious circle. The towns can give nothing to the peasants because they cannot get anything from them and vice versa. The only solution is to make the peasants supply the towns, i.e., to establish farms run by the Government or by joint stock companies, which will supply the industrial centres and make them work, and Avhen this is attained, renew commercial interchange with the villages.The idea of establishing big estates run on progressive lines is not new. During the last years of Czardom, Mr. A. Meshtchersky, managing director of a leading agricultural firm, laid before the Imperial Govern-ment a scheme of big farms in Astrakhan. The scheme was started by a group of St. Petersburg banks. He did not receive the concession as the growth of industrialised agriculture would have handicapped the landed nobility, whom the Emperor held to be his main support. To exploit the south-eastern territories profitably, the Bureau for Electrifi-cation would establish farm units of 60,000 to 100,000 hectars to which power would be supplied by their respective central power stations, three-phase current, the highest possible combination for making cheaper the main lines of the high tension, to save copper in feeders. The necessary power to be generated by steam turbines run on tubular boilers with superheated steam. The fuel will be the straw of wheat and of other grain. With the use of a special fore-hearth it has been proved in South Russia that straw makes an economical fuel on being decomposed into fine coke and then into gas. The effect of a combination of fine coke and inflammable gas gives a good steady penetrating heat. Straw in South-eastern Russia is generally used only for cattle and fuel and is now so abundant that it has to be burnt in the stack to be got rid of. It is calculated that the balance, after all other requirements, of straw of the electrified estates would be sufficient to run the boilers at full capacity for 200 days a year. That is, that all farm work could be done by this kind of fuel, which has the advantage over coal that it is renewed yearly.The Bureau calculates that the free area fit for culture but not used by anyone, owing to the necessity to use methods of dry agriculture, is
approximately 200,000,000 hectare, which, if and when properly culti-vated, could amply supply the whole of European Russia, Europe, and India with wheat, &amp;c.Agrarian Conditions before the Revolution.. Before the Revolution the Imperial policy was based partly on the patronage of the great estates and landed nobility and partly on the gradual transfer of such lands to the peasantry to create a conservative yeomanry. Laud values iu the average were low and the transfer from the great landowners to the peasantry was increasing yearly, especially after Stolypin&apos;s reform.The noblemen&apos;s estates were bringing an average net profit of some 3*2 per cent, yearly against loans on mortgage, hence gradually expropriating-priating the big landowners. As a rule the landed nobility did not use money received on mortgage to improve their land or their fanning of it, but invested it in State Bonds, Railway Bonds, and other sound stock with profits of about 4^ per cent., living on the difference of the rates of interest. Of course, such a procedure was disastrous for agriculture and general farming. The crops on the big estates were somewhat better than those of the peasants, and almost all Russian export abroad and the feeding of the towns, the industrial and other under-producing districts was done partly by the big estates and partly by Siberian wheat.Since the 17th century, in fact, the import into the towns and the export to foreign countries has depended almost entirely on the grain produced by the landowners. In 1913 the area of arable laud belonging to these was about 15 per cent, of the whole, and our export was conse-quently about 15 per cent, of the output of grain within the Empire, whilst the better output of the estates as against the peasants allowed a certain balance of grain to feed our towns, industrial, and poorer districts. This equilibrium has been broken by the Revolution, because the peasant successors to the former landowners were unable to become producers.Agriculture was unprofitable under the Empire. The great estates of the black-soil belt brought an average net profit of 3 to 4 per cent, yearly, that is to say, less than any other industrial concern. Lands were falling gradually into the hands of the peasants, who could busy themselves with farming only because they did not appreciate their own labour spent on lands owned by them. There was thus a gradually increased exodus of the more energetic and intelligent among them to branches of industry other than agriculture.Effect upon Agriculture of the Soviet Government.This was the position when the Revolution broke out. No one dreamt that such a thing as a famine could ever exist in the Russian Empire. The Revolution converted the land, not into an object of culture, but into an object of politics, demagogy, &amp;c, the worst in this way being done by Victor Tchernoff and his party, who instructed peasants to demolish everything, so that when the Bolsheviks came into power they had as a rule to deal with the mere wreck of the great estates. The Socialist Party of the present Government, however, tries by hook or by crook to favour town industry, and so is disastrous to agriculture. Its policy is based on the idea that industrial workmen are more easily convertible into Socialists than peasants, and on the ever-increasing demands of labour for higher wages, which makes it necessary, on the one hand, to raise the prices of industrial products, as compared with grain, &amp;C, and, on the other, compels the Government to swell the issues of-paper money incredibly.  At present the daily issue of paper money
exceeds the yearly issue of the Imperial Government during war time. It all eventually filters through different channels into the villages, only a small portion of it returning to the towns or to the Government.The present Attitude of the Peasants.The present mood of the peasants is different from before the Revolu-tion. They now understand that their labour is to be paid for and are no longer willing to sell their products at a reasonable price. Prices, therefore, have gone very high. Again, the peasants&apos; own necessities are higher ; they have acquired the taste for more comfort, and this makes their own selling prices higher still, whilst the towns cannot regularly supply them with manufactured goods. All this, with the prohibition of free trade and the severe punishments enacted against the breaker of Socialist laws, together with the. increase of prices, difficulties of traffic and transport, the whole governed by the decrees regulating prices, have had the effect of making the peasants reduce production while raising their prices as much as possible.The peasants hoard paper money because they cannot get anything for it at preseut. In the future, they hope it may enable them to pur-chase the landed properties they have seized, and so to become proprietors in the full and legal sense of the word. Their seemingly unnecessary devastation of the great estates in reality had a purpose : (1) Thoroughly to evict the former landowner and make him unable to re-establish his estate.. This led to the destruction of all property which could not be used by the peasants themselves.(2) The destruction of property will compel the former landowner to sell his land at a low price.(3) The preseut bad tillage by the peasantry is designed to exhaust the land for the same reason.\ It must be emphasised that the peasants have never regarded farming as a mere industry. The Russian word &quot; husbandry &quot; does not mean the industry, but the way of living, the root word meaning the husband or master of the home, ie., an independent individual. The Russian peasant yearns only for the independent life. This is the inborn feeling of the race and will presently be the ruin of the industry and towns of Russia, because the wretched condition of life in the towns and industrial centres made the workman fly to the country and become agriculturist peasants, so reconstituting in themselves the inborn feeling of independence.Professor Mendelieffs Scheme.This was understood by the well-known scientist, Professor D. Mendelieff, who insisted long ago upon the creation of peasant industries as the preliminary step necessary for the establishment in Russia of big industries. His scheme was devised for the profitable use of the period of time between October and March when the huge peasant population of Russia is idle. The artificial industrialism of Russia based, on unskilled labour seemed precarious to him, and in fact events have shown that our workmen, once converted into peasants, never revert to industry again. Mendelieffs scheme was the application of electric power to the. villages for the use of small industries, such as weaving, textile, smith&apos;s work, &amp;c, the combination of peasants&apos; industries into productive associations, not by legislation but by technical means.German capitalists and the Bolsheviks are atone in understanding the necessity of power supply. They are, therefore, agreed on the scheme to electrify Central Russia and her outlets, the difference between German
and Bolshevik being purely political, i,e., the difference between German Capitalism and Imperialism as against Soviet Communism and Imperialist Internationalism, neither thinking of Russia or her people.The Shortcomings of the Soviet Regime.The Bolshevik Government is fully cognisant of the importance of the Urals, which should become the great centres of metallurgic, mechanic and electro-mechanic industries. It has opened large credits for the re-establishment of these industries. Unfortunately the Communistic regulations are such that credits do not help. If spent under the United States laws and regulations they would help enormously. Comrade Tchubar of the Higher Council of National Economics was appointed to re-establish the industries in the Urals, as soon as the Koltchak armies retreated east of them. Unfortunately without result. The Bolshevik Government is in the enhanced circle of famine, ruined transport, dilapidated industries and. Socialistic dogmas, and no matter how great the present Governments efforts to organise production, all falls down as soon as the organisation is started by them.How the Bolsheviks have instilled the idea of &quot; Big Industry.&quot;The idea of industrialism as expressed by the leaders of the Govern-ment is the creation of all States&apos; industrial trust, but the mistake is that all personal initiative is killed, that all profits are a priori denied, that all private, &amp;c., concerns are socialised and brought into an utter impossibility to work. The great merit of the Bolsheviks is that the id^a of the trust is now well understood by the population which will welcome it when there is an ordinary non-Socialistic Government; such a Government when it comes, will be able to meet all difficulties as most of these are created by the socialism. The workmen now absolutely ready for syndicalism.   This is the result of the Bolshevistic experiments.3.-THE SOVIET GOVERNMENTS DECREE REGARDING FOREIGN TRADE.(The following decree regarding foreign trade is extracted from No. 125, dated Wth June 1920, of the Izvestia, the official organ in Moscow of the Soviet Government. It is thought it may be of interest as shoioing in -detail the absolute nature of the nationalisation of trade and commerce by the Bolshevik regime.)Supplementary to and in amendment of all previous decrees aud regulations concerning the organisation of foreign trade and exchange of goods on the part of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, the &quot; Soviet of People&apos;s Commissais&quot; has resolved : (1) &quot;The People&apos;s Commissariat for Trade-and Industry&quot; to be known in future as &quot; The People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.&quot;(2) The following general basis for trade aud exchange of goods to bo instituted : (a) &quot; The Peopled Commissariat for Foreign Trade&quot; will be solely responsible for conducting nationalised trade and exchange of goods for the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.The former, as the only authorised organ of the Republic, will have the exclusive right of carrying oh trade relations with foreign countries, companies, private institutions and 0 11837 f
organisations, and individuals. It will also be responsible for the execution of all measures and for the materialisation of all operations connected with the import and export of goods,- through its respective &quot;organs,(6) No department, institution or organisation of the R.S.F.S.R., and no private undertaking or individual will in future have the right to conclude any transactions connected with the import of goods without a preliminary agreement and permission of the &quot; People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade &quot; or its respective foreign organs, and in accordance with their conditions and regulations;Remark 1. All departments, institutions, organisations, and private individuals, should, they receive any offers from abroad concerning import,and export of goods, must forward all such offers to the &quot; People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade,&quot; for instructions as to their disposal.Remark 2.-All institutions, undertakings, organisations, and private individuals, paying for goods of foreign manu-facture without the knowledge and consent of the &quot; Peopled Commissariat for -Foreign Trade&quot; will be Considered as guilty of &quot; plundering Government property.&quot;(c) For the compilation of a general plan of exchange of goods, arid for the settlement of all general and private questions that may crop up in. practice, and which will require consideration from the point of view &quot;of iiiterdepart-mental interests, a Special Soviet for Foreign Trade is to be formed, attached to the&apos;&quot;Peopled Commissariat for Foreign Trade,&quot; arid will function, in accordance with the policy laid down by the &quot; Soviet of People&apos;s Commissars.&quot;4.-THE JEWISH COMMUNIST MOVEMENT IN SOVIET RUSSIA.The cfuesfioh of &apos;tl[e responsibility of Jews in the Communist organisation has led to a great deal of debate, in the course of which statistics of doubtful accuracy have been freely bandied about. Under the circumstances it Was almost inevitable that the Jews would take a considerable part in the new movement. Russia was a country in which the bourgeoisie was numerically and in importance small in relation to the &quot;official clas&amp;Jes, the workmen, and the peasantry. &quot;On the downfall of the old regime the comparatively well educated Jews were bound to come, if not to the top, at least into situations which placed power within their reach. Consequently the number of JeAvs now occupying high posi-tions in the Soviet Government is probably larger than that to which the Jewish community is entitled, either on account of its.numbers or of its higher educational standard. Even in Russia, however, from the very beginning, there have been many Jewish anti-Bolshevists, while, on the other harid, several of the leading commissaries are known to be very anti-Jewish. Tchitcherin is a Russian, though several of his assistants are Jews. D jerjhirisky, the head of the Extraordinary Commission, is not a Jew, and Jews are said not to preponderate in Witt Commission. Mogilevsky, Djerjhinsky&apos;s right-hand mnn, is rigidly anti-Semite, and is at present trying to hunt down Jews in Moscow who &apos;are rumoured among the Bolshevists to have supplied Mr. North with large sums of money for anti-Bolshevist agitation, while many anti-Bolshevist Jews are probably opposed to Lenin, whose schemes for inflating currency until money becomes Valueless cannot be supposed to appeal to Jewish instincts.
An article dealing with the Jewish question in Issue 9 of the authentic German edition of the Communist International, the confidential publication of the Communist Central Committee, published under the direction of G. Zinovieff, may be supposed to reflect the irath as known to its writers pretty accurately, since this edition of the Communist Inter national is strictly confidential and is not given to anyoue of the outer circle.This article states that the revolution of October 1917 hardly moved the independently organised Jewish labourers-. The Bund, the oldest Jewish revolutionary mass organisation, is described as in close relations with the Mensheviks and the Second International from 1912 till after the failure of the Kerensky Government and the rising of the proletariat iu July 1917, when the Internationalists got the upper baud in its councils. The small bourgeois. Jew in town and country, however, is said at that time to have still remained anti-Bolshevik.The Bund appears for a time still to have been in close touch with the United Jewish Socialist Labour Party, which was formed in March 1907 by the amalgamation of the &quot; Zionist Socialists &quot; and the &quot; Jewish Socialists,&quot; whose leaders were Scimowzy and Serpowzy. The Jewish Socialist Labour Party worked for a personal, national, Jewish autonomy, but is described as having come again after the first revolutionary excitement had passed, under the direction of the Jewish plutocrats.The society known as the &quot;Poale Zion&quot; is said to have been more receptive for Bolshevik tendencies from the beginning because it was never linked with the Second International. As the weakness of the Kerensky Government became evident the Jewish organisations gradually evolved towards Communism and a corresponding agitation against the Kerensky Government took place. The out-and-out Communists among these organisations succeeded in establishing numerous Communist groups under a Jewish Communist Central office affiliated to the Communist Party, and displayed a good deal of activity in spreading Communist literature in Yiddish.The revolution of November 1917 resulted in a still further increase in Communism among the Jews, a tendency shown by the creation of the Jewish Communist Union, August 1918, and the decision of this Union at the Jewish Conference of Nomeln in November 1919, when that group joined the Third International and left the Jewish Socialist Labour Party. The differences between the Union and the United Jewish Socialist Party were settled at a common meeting in May 1919 when the Jewish Communist Federation, later better known by its abbreviated Jewish name of Farband,&quot; was established. The organs of the &quot; Farband&quot; are the &quot; Kommunistiche Fohn&quot; and &quot; Kom-muriistiche Stimme,&quot; the latter published at Odessa.During the second part of 1919 the Jewish Communist movement considerably increased ; a special department was established at Kieff to gain the sympathies of the Jews for the Red Army, and published a periodical entitled &quot; The Red Army Weekly.&quot;Jewish Communist publications in Russia are the daily paper &quot;Der Stern,&quot; published at Witebsk. and the weekly, &quot;Bednota,&quot; published at Nomeln. The Moscow Central Office for Propaganda publishes &quot;Die Kommunistische Welt,&quot; which is said to be specially adapted to Jewish readers and carries on propaganda amongst Jews in foreign countries.On the whole, however, it would appear from the &quot; Communist International,&quot; as well as from other information, that the preponderance of Jews among the originators of tha Russian Communist movement, and of distinctively Jewish influence upon the movement itself have
&quot;not been disproportionate. It is certainly, wrong to credit all Jews with the uncanny prescience of the existing state of things in Russia displayed in the famous &quot; Protocols of Zion,&quot; first published here in 1902 in the pamphlet &quot; The Jewish Peril.&quot; Jews have been divided as regards the Communist movement in Russia as in all else. They have, liow-ever, a way of being attracted to the successful party, and the growing success of the Communists and pseudo-Communists in Russia has been no exception. A.s the article quoted above seems to show, however, their gradual adherence to the Communist Party has been parasitic, and seems more consonant with the qualities of adaptability which characterise their race than with the obscure world conspiracy for which they are in some quarters held responsible.Printed by Etre and Spottiswoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.C.4i
