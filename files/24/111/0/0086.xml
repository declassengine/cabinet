k, ThlLDocui^^\y i Drltannic Majors Goyernmo- -Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.A, JWiAAf&apos;      53Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of Slate for India, datedIHth September 1920.Following is the weekly telegram. Resolution of special Congress adopting non-co-operation absorbing topic of interest in Press. Now decision taken, the people beginning to reflect on what non-co-operation involves. Adoption of resolution everywhere recognised as personal triumph for Gandhi and not due to the soundness of his reasoning or acquiescence of thoughtful politicians, whether moderate or extremist. Fallacies and dangers of non-co-operation continue to be exposed in the Press. Resolution as carried advises, inasmuch as it is desirable in prosecution of movement to take minimum of risks and to call for least sacrifice compatible with attainment of desired object: (a) surrender of titles, honorary offices and nominated seats on local bodies; (b) refusal to attend Government levees, darbars, official and semi-official functions; (c) gradual withdrawal of children from schools and colleges owned, aided or controlled by Government, and in place of such schools and colleges establishment of national schools and colleges in various provinces; (d) gradual boycott of British courts by lawyers and litigants, and the establishment of private arbitration courts for the settlement of private disputes; (e) refusal on the part of military, clerical and labouring classes to offer as recruits for service in Mesopotamia ; (/) withdrawal by candidates of candidature for election, and refusal on the part of voters to vote for any candidate who may offer himself for election; (g) boycott of foreign goods. &quot;Gradual&quot; introduced at desire of majority, though characterised as weakness by Gandhi while some delegates wished to substitute British for foreign. Congress has appointed Committee of Gandhi, Patel, and Moti Lai Nehru to frame rules for the conduct of the non-co-operation campaign.2. Voting is instructive. - Exact number of delegates present on last day not known, but ont of 5,814 delegates registered only 2,735 took part in voting, 1,852 voting for Gandhi&apos;s resolution and 883 for Pal&apos;s amendment. Every province save Central Provinces and Berar had majority for Gandhi. , Lajput Rai&apos;s paper, Bande Mataram, commenting on decision, says, &quot; Though adopted by overwhelming majority cannot, be said to be decision of whole nation.&quot; Other papers, while minimising Gandhi&apos;s achievement, do not consider victory places him in a position to carry out programme effectively. Majority of local leaders always been against it ; whole Nationalist Press opposed it exempli gratia : Tribune, Amrita Bazaar Patrika, Leader and Independent. In Madras and Bengal minority against Gandhi Very powerful. Great majority of Punjab delegates were favourable to Gandhi&apos;s resolution, but do not, we believe, represent true feeling, of province. Similarly with the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, where Talukdars of Oudh have condemned movement. Criticism generally directed against withdrawal of children from schools and lawyers from practice. Result of non-co-operation not realised as yet, though limitations beginning to be appreciated and converse of Government exercising similar power of non-co-operation being put forward in- Press, e.g., Leader. Possible division of extremists into two parties may result, namely, out-and-out followers of Gandhi and combination of others with moderates who can no longer have place in Congress which will remain stronghold of extremists. Difficult to estimate practical effect of Congress decision at present. In Council several non-officials openly dissociated themselves from the movement, and three leading politicians in Madras, including Kasturi Ayengar, have resigned. Baptista and Chandravarkar have also issued Press statements condemning non-co-operation. Iswar Saran has resigned presidentship United Provinces Provincial Congress Committee as protest against non-co-operation. On the other hand, in Madras, C. Raghavacharia, and in.Bengal 22 candidates for election (including B. Chakravarti and C. R. Das), most of whom voted against non-co-operation, have withdrawn, candidature for election out of loyalty to Congress, while in Punjab Bakshi Tek Chand and Professor Ruchi Ram iSahni withdrawn candidature for election, though former has resigned his secretaryship of Punjab Provincial Congress Committee as. protest against non-co-operation. Gandhi, though now regarded with suspicion by educated classes, has very great influence over the masses, which he may use mischievously at any time. 2325  100  9.20
Khilafat Conference. Chief resolutions as follows : Offered sympathy to Indian Mussulmans going on Hijrat and resolved that Central Khilafat Committee should immediately make arrangements for Muhajarin; (2) resolved to carry on constant agitation against Turkish, peace terms until temporal status of Khilafat restored;. (3) resolved non-co-operation, religious obligation, absolutely binding Indian Mussul-mans ; (4) expressed gratitude to Amir of Afghanistan for Islamic brotherhood with which (sic) received and treated Indian Muhajarin, and trusts that all possible facilities will be given in future to Indian Muhajarin by Afghan Government; (5) considers. Hindu Mussulman unity absolutely essential for future betterment of India; (6) appeals to Mussulmans India to collect at least 30 lakhs of rupees for successful working Khilafat movement; (7) urges provincial Committee to organise volunteer corps; (8) advises deputation to visit all prominent Sajjadah Nashins to invite attention to religious obligations; (9) expresses sympathy with people North-West Frontier Province and Sincl for unjust official oppression in Khilafat movement; and (10) congratulates Egypt on securing national independence by constant agitation and sacrifice.. Latest report regarding Hijrat shows Muhajarin arriving back via Khyber and through Mohmand country. Resettlement in Peshawar proceeding satisfactorily, and considerable expression of gratitude to Government. In Bannu district malicious agitators continue to mislead people into disbelieving stoppage of Hijrat. Efforts been made to dissuade Muhajarin from proceeding to Afghanistan, but this may have to be relaxed, as only way of bringing them to reason is to let them learn the lesson as people of Peshawar have clone. In North-West Punjab reported feeling against Afghans growing bitter as they raped women who went on Hijrat. Endeavours being made to organise opposition to Khilafat party. People who resigned service endeavouring to get back if they can evade oath, they swore. In Punjab generally distinct lull in political activity, which may break out afresh on return of congress delegates from Calcutta. Zafar Ali Khan, editor and proprietor of Zamindar news-- paper arrested on arrival at Lahore, will be placed on trial under section 124a Penal Code for violently seditious-speeches made recently at Attock. Trial of accused in Willoughby&apos;s murder case begun.In consequence disallowance of resolution proposed to be moved by Sastri on Punjab disturbance, 23 resolutions withdrawn on 14th by Messrs. Sastri, Sinha,. Chanda and Khaparde as protest, and Patel has resigned.   Sastri, in interview, bitterly criticised action as proof of impotence of Imperial Legislative Council and humiliating position of members.   Last meeting yesterday passed off harmoniously. Many questions on Hunter&apos;s report answered.   Congratulatory speeches made by Sastri, Sinha, Banerjee and others on passage of Territorial and Auxiliary Force Bill. Viceroy in farewell speech, after paying high tribute to retiring Commander-in-Chief, made impressive appeal for restoration of good feeling.   Referring to fact he had disallowed Mr. Sastri&apos;s resolution dealing with the Punjab disturbances, he said these matters had been discussed in Parliament, Council, and the Press for 18 months, and if peace and goodwill are to be restored must be ended if possible.    He felt as keenly as anyone regarding the need of holding Indian life and honour sacred in times of crisis like last year&apos;s, and Government were preparing measures to prevent recurrence of errors and excesses, but each new discussion only made the chances of reconciliation more remote.   Finally he alluded to the coming and larger representative assembly,, and said institutions of (? everlasting) British traditions do not die, they find a new birth in re-incarnation.    Speech very well received in Council, and apparently impressed all non-official members considerably, but it is impossible to say at present what effect disallowing resolution or of Viceroy&apos;s farewell speech will be on the&apos; country at large.   Extremist papers are certain to make the most of former, but there are many moderates who think that the Punjab controversy is best buried now.   How far they will have the courage*to say so is another matter.Considerable labour unrest in Madras on account of lock-out of strikers by management of oil companies. On 10th,.assistant while on way to installation was attacked and stabbed, apparently by locked-out workmen. Later in the day.a collision occurred between police and mob attempting to attack installation. No casualties or serious injuries, but police officers and others struck by stones. Police dispersed mob and made four arrests.In1 Bihar Council on. 11th, Lieutenant-Governor announced further release of ,Shaliabad prisoners.   Action enthusiastically received.
