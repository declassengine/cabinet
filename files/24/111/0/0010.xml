if /^ .. CONFIDENTIAL. fff, fofUj/uAyt *i\f^^SIJ5[5^v Property of      / o\* \\     rjTTpTCTn&apos; &apos;&quot;r&apos;V\-y)&apos; f;j Government.&apos;......isiisisssssw-e primary object of the oruise la to inspect certainworks which are either &quot;being carried out by the Admiralty, or for which the Admiralty have a Joint responsibility.It will he remembered that after the Armistice, Ostend and Zeebrugge were rendered useless for merchant shipping or other purposes by the blookships which had been sunk in the gallant attacks on &apos;those places made during the&quot;war, and by various other vessels which filled the respective ports. Kather less than two years ago, the Admiralty undertook to clear the ports if it were possible to carry, out successfully so big an enterprise.The general opinion was that it would be impossible to move the vessels which were of some 5,000 tons burden;   and blowing them up would have made confusion worse confounded.The task was undertaken by the Admiralty - the cost tobe defrayed by the Belgian Government;   and it was at the urgent request of the latter that the British Admiralty consented to undertake the task.During all the months that have passed., constant labour has been expended upon the work-   there have been many dis-appointmentsj   and I believe the general opinion was that the work could not he effectively carried through.But to take them in detail -- Ostend is now clear, the various, small ships which were sunk in the harbour have been removed;   and on Monday the 16th August-., Commodore Young attained the wonderful triumph of removing the &quot;Vindictive&quot; from where she lay at the entrance to the harbour, up to a safe resting place at the further&apos;end, where she win probably remain to be utilised, as we understand, by the Belgians for show purposes.It is difficult to convey to anybody who has not seen the &quot;Vindictive&quot; as she lay with a broken back against the old,rotten
72rotten pier, what a tremendous task it was to remove her. Commodore Young conceived&apos;the idea that if he could get some lighters or dredgers of a certain strength, he would be able to pass steel hawsers under the &quot;Vindictive&quot; - and having patched up her holes and generally hound her together&apos;by iron girders, he believed he would he able to move her.His first supreme effort was made on Sunday the 15th August, and although she moved very slightly, she did not materially improve her position,    .But on Monday at about 3.0 p.m. the whole collection of barges, lighters, etc. which were surrounding her, moved with the &quot;Vindiotive&quot; in the middle.It is a wonderful triumph for British engineering skill, determination and unflagging labour - and Commodore Young and those who have worked with him, deserve the warmest commendation for what they have accomplished.     Admiral Philpotts, who had been connected with the earlier operations, was present, and had every right to share in the triumph.It is satisfactory to know that the old &quot;Vindictive&quot;, which played so splendid a part in the attacks on Zeebrugge and Ostend, will now he preserved as an interesting and glorious * relic of what is probably one of the most remarkable and gallant incidents in all the history of naval warfare.&apos; Ostend is now clear;   and all the damage-done to the harbour by the war is repaired.The next place to be inspected was Zeebrugge..    There it will  be remembered that the &quot;Thetis&quot;, &quot;Iphigenia&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot;, were loaded with cement and sunk across the entrance -tothe Bruges Canal&apos;, effectively blocking it for all purposes -hut especially for t^e main purpose for -vhioh it was used by the Germans,* namely, the storage of submarines.     Some two or three miles up the. Canal, there is a wonderful submarine harbour, covered in, capable of holding a very large number;   and this,
71and all the other arrangements made by the Germans, was rendered useless by the glorious attack and consequent destruction of the Oanal by the blooding.of the entrance.These ships had to he moved &quot;before the Canal could he properly used again.     Commodore Young triumphed.    He moved the &quot;Thetis&quot; on to the hank, which was all., that was necessary in her case.    He succeeded in raising the &quot;Iphigenia&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&apos;&apos; and placed them also on the hank - and he therefore cleared the entrance to the Oanal, which today is open for all purposes.It is gratifying to know that the work has been accomplished by the British Admiralty;   and that it is again at Zeebrugge, as in the case of Ostend, that the successful accom-plishment of a tremendous task is due to British enterprise, industry and pluck..1 then went to Heligoland.    For the demolition of the fortifications there, the Admiralty are again jointly responsible with the Army.This is a most remarkable instance of German preparation; the island is rather less than a mile long, and 800 yards across at the broadest part.   &apos; It is like a miniature Gibraltar; precipitous cliffs of a sort of red sandstone, with occasional strata- of, I think, chalky substance.     As the cliffs -show signs of decay, the Germans had built a really wonderful seawall in order to protect them.     They had created a magnificent harbour capable of holding a great many destroyers;   and during the war, not less than 60 submarines lay In the portion reserved for these vessels at one time.     The harbour is one of the most complete things of its. kind I have ever seen.    There are coal and oil stores, underground passages, and every arrangement to make the place secure..   The main body of the island is fortified in a most remarkable way.     There are subterranean galleries -which go from one end of the island to the other, and which are approached by a turns! which passes also right, throughout the. island.There
74There are galleries, munition stores, gun emplacements -everything calculated to offer a determined defence.     Thv. wholo of this marvellous structure is covered over by concrete which is 8 feet deep, soil again being laid on the top of it to a sufficient depth to enable grass of an excellent quality to grow in some places, and vegetables etc. to be cultivated in others,During the war, the Germans had a&apos; garrison of 4,000 men; the population of the island, which is said to be somewhere about 2,000, were all moved over to the mainland.    There are four batteries of what ore equivalent, I believe, to 12&quot; guns, two at the S. end and 2 at the N., and they are called respectively, as from the S, end, &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Bertha&quot;, &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Dora&quot;.   There is a very powerful searchlight on the top of the islandj which was working while we were there;   hut during the war the lantern was removed, and two small lighthouses erected which could be lowered into the ground:   this was all done in order that therti should he no obstacle to gunfire.It is difficult to understand why the Germans fortified so completely a place like Heligoland, which could be of little use to them for attack, still less for defence; but having made up their minds to do it, they.carried Out the work in the most efficient, manner - and it is a strange commentary upon all the money and labour expended upon these fortifications, that during the whole of the war, it is said that the big guns there were only fired twice.It is stated that&apos;the. Germans spent 30 millions sterling on their wo&quot;barracks at Heligoland, and I do not think there can be any exaggeration in this, as they are *f the most remarkable character.The work of demolition is being most efficiently and s.teadily carried out under the supervision of British officers, naval and military, Captain V/illan, R.N., being the officer responsiblb under the Admiralty.when we were considering last year what should be done, -in &apos;
75in regard to Heligoland, the Germans rut in a very earnest pleathat the fishing harbour should not be destroyed, alleging thatofit was&apos;the only harbour/refuge on those coasts: &apos; I learnt on very reliable authority that from the day they tooh Heligoland over, they never allowed a fishing vessel to enter the harbour. This is an interesting proof of their methods.Convinced as I am that demolition is right, and that so far as the Germans are concerned it is only a meet punishment for all they did, yet one cannot heir regretting that such splendid works should now be destroyed, including as they do excellent modern barracks for 4,000 men all of which have to be destroyed.     Coming fresh from &quot;england where housing accommodation is so short, one could not help regretting that it is not possible to move these buildings bodily somewhere else.The machinery, blocks of granite, etc, are being moved bodily to the German mainland;   but all the rest is simply being -blown up by explosive and then thrown into the sea - so that the harbour will not only be demolished as regards its breakwater and defences, but it will also be practically filled up, except for the small portion reserved for fishing purposes.It is gratifying to know that in all these three cases, British officers and rank and file aided by civilians, are charged with the work of supervision, control, initiation and execution;   and I cannot speak too highly of the way in which the work in every case is being done.     If some of those at home -who complain of existing conditions, could see what is going on, at Heligoland, they would realise what is the difference between victory and defeat!     The conditions as regards food, clothing, etc. are certainly much, worse in Germany and its possessions, than they are in the United Kingdom;   and added to this common suffering, there is the horrible, evidence of defeat in the constantwork .
76vovY vrhioh is beinp: carried out by (remans, efficiently enough no doubt, though very sullenly, under the control and super-vision of those who have conquered then.     It was a sight, once seen, never to be forgotten I(Id.)     M. H. L.24. 8. 20.
