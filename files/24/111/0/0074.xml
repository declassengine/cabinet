j j JA TJ S T R A L I A.A marked improvement has been shown lately in&apos;the rate of recruiting for the Royal Australian Navy.   Tais is attributed in part to the recent improvements in the rates of pay for naval ratings.   It is believed, however, that the Prince1 s visit has not been without influence,.   It has shown very conclusively how popular the navy is with the people of Australia, and has directed the public attention to it in various ways.When asked recently vhy compulsory naval training was being resumed while similar action had not yet been taken in regard to military training, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) said that there were two main reasons for the difference.   The first was the need for building up reserve crews for the Australian Navy.   The second was the ^numtjers affected, and therefore the expense involved, were much smaller in the case of naval training than in that of military training.   Sir Joseph Cook added that he could see no reason why Australia should not supply all the recruits for the Australian Navy.SQVIgP ,RUSSIA.Baltic.     It is reported that on 10th September a Bolshevik minelayer was observed from Styrsund Lighthouse laying mines outside Kaporia Bay.Two torpedo boats were also operating near the coast North of &quot;Krasnaya Gorka.   It is reported that recently Bol&amp;hevik Naval forces have been frequently seen manoeuvring and carrying out firing exercises West of Kronstadt, the largest number seen at one time being eight ships, consisting of one Cruiser, destroyers and trawlers.   The Assistant Military Attache, Helsingfors, reports that while at Moirs Point on 13th September, he observed vessels of approximately 3,000 tons,type &quot;Narova&quot;, apparently, laying mines.   The Estimated position of ships when last seen was between 600 No and 60o.5 N., 290 East, in the vicinity of the Russo-Finnish sea boundary.   The vessels proceeded in an Easterly direction.U.S.S. &quot;Brooks&quot; sailed from Devonport for Copenhagen on 18th September.   U.S.S. &quot;Pittsburgh11 and &quot;Frederick11 sailed from Libau Westwards on 19t$i September.A Russian ship, &quot;SubotnikS flying the Red Flag, which left Murmansk some weeks ago with the Soviet Russian Trade Union Delegation, is reported to have arrived at Hamburg on or about the 14th September.   She is alleged to be carrying large quanti-ties of munitions and about half &apos;a million gold roubles.   A close watch will be maintained on the vessel in case she may attempt to enter a British port after leaving Hamburg.SOUTH   RUSSIA.Moscow has issued warning to Mariners that Novorossiskapproaches along the coast between Lat. 44c30! N. and Long.37.o40 must be treated as dangerous for navigation.Members of Polish Peace Delegation were conveyed in 11 VANQUISHER11, &quot;VTMIERA&quot; and &quot;WESSEX&quot; from Danzig to &apos;Riga on 15th September.   ,
SOUTH   RUSSIA     (Oontd.)On 15th September a Naval engagement took place In the Sea of Azov between nine Bolshevik armed vessels and four South Russian Government armed vessels, resulting in three of the former being damaged and one of the latter sunk.The French are supplying oil for Wrangelrs ships and if the Reds attempt to invade the Crimea, as Wrangel fears, the French may give active support.   Yfrangel has asked for the assistance of British destroyers, but O- a-0 has directed that these are not to move from their stations.   The Bolsfeevik Submarine fiA.G023&apos;tl is reported nearly   complete at Nikolae^. C-in-C has issued instructions that she is to be attacked at sight if she proceeds to sea.   This question is being re-ferred to the Foreign Office.Finland.     It.has been pointed out to the Finnish Government tEat &quot;the appointment of German Naval Officers for instructional purposes to the Finnish Navy would entail a &quot;breach of Article 179 of Versailles Treaty by Germany.0 A U 0 A S I A.u.....mm nn.    aiiMi..,, m m . wow.**wi*       i ********NhiAzerbaijan.      Great difficulty has been experienced in conveying&quot;&quot;sTores to the British prisoners at Baku.   Stores were sent by a messenger on 21st August but Russian Oom-missaries and workmen absolutely prohibited him from transferr-ing boxes to the prisoners house, and he reports that he was enly able to pass small quantities to prisoners and that only after dark.   Commissaries searched our prisoners and appropriate-ated  200 in 3n&amp;lish notes on the ground that.the possession of English money was forbidden in Soviet territories.   The prisoners are allowed short daily exercise in the yard, but may not leave the house or even look through the windows overlooking the street.   The transfer of the prisoners from Bailov prison was  vehemently opposed.A formal letter, demanding the release of the British prisoners, was handed to Huseinov on 6th September through the Georgian Foreign Office.GERMANY.The 15th Convoy consisting of the light cruisers 11 STETTIN11 and &quot;DANZIG&quot; &quot;two T. class destroyers and eleven A boats arrived at Rosyth on the 16th September.   This com-pletes the surrender of all German vessels to the Allies except T.B.S.italy the Italian training cruiser &quot;FoFerruccie&quot; is expected to arrive at Portsmouth on 20th September for a short visit during -which the cadets &quot;will be&quot; shown round the Dockyard.The Italian base at VALONA has been closed. .T U ft K g Y.The &quot;HIEIH RSIS!I and Motor Launch No. 14 have arrived at CONSTANTINOPLE for internment with the remainder of the Turkish Fleet.
 u G 0   -jjlS LA VI A.The orders for H.M.S. &quot;Ramillies11 to be x^resent at the evacuation of Cattaro have he en cancelled and this country will be represented by a destroyer.   A representa tive of Admiral Watson1 s Commission will probably be on board.   France and Italy will also send destroyers.   No decision has yet been arrived at regarding the disposal of the torpedo boats allotted to Jugo Slavia.The distribution of the ex-Austro Hungarian Danube Flotilla is to be proceeded with at once.F R A N 0 E,l*i .1mm   *mmm    mtmmw imM. mm   WmW**pRear-Admiral L.

PAISO___II.   GENERAL   INTBJjLIGBTO.ME3 OPQUHI A.There has boon some improvement in the Tribal outlook during the last week.   In areas already disaffected there has been no appreciable spread of unrest,   /Except as regards the hostile- operations against Samawah, and sporadic enter-prises of small bodies elsewhere, the Arab tribes seem inclined to seek tfretir homes.   This may be due to the absence of any promising objectives or to&quot;internal pre-occupation*P E R S I A,The G-.0.0. Mesopotamia has been instructed to avoid making any reduction   in the British force in North West Persia, and should circumstances necessitate his withdrawing the entire -orce in order to save the situation in Mesopotamia, he must first obtain cabinet authority.Afghan representatives in Teheran are reported to be intriguing wit;i the local&apos; Bolsheviks with a view to the con-elusion of an alliance betweenIbrsia and the Russian Soviet.? INLAND.Tlie three International Jurists charged by the League of Nations with the investigation of the Aaland Island question, have reported, that they consider the natter to be essentially an international one falling within the scope of the League, and not a purely domestic concern as claimed by Finland. Finland refuses to accept this decision, and Sweden says the matter will be decided by the League of Nations, but she will never give up the Islands which are essentially Swedish*SOVIET   RUSSIA.The Admiralty view regarding1 trade with Russia is that all proposals &quot;or trade resumption are premature, and that normal diplomatic relations should first be resumed, as, until policy towards Soviet Russia is settled, there is no security, and resumptioncf trade on ordinary lines is impracticable.The Bolsheviks have had successes South-West of.Grodno and have driven the Poles back to Sidra and Sokolka.   They have-also occupied Malonarewka, South-East of BieXy stock.   The Bolsheviks are advancing in Kovel, which the Poles are reported to have occupied, taking many prisoners and material,.   Lut &apos;k has also been captured and Budennie is now reported to be con-oentrating to the North of the town*   The Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Polish troops expect to reach old German lines in a week and will stand there.   Peace negotiations! will shortly be resumed at Riga; the Bolshevik delegation arrived on 1.3th September and the Polish delegation on 16th September. British Destroyers were placed at their disposal for -the journey from Dansig to Libau.Latvia.   The Central Executive at Moscow ratified peace with Latvia on 9th September.   Lettish ratification cannot be completed :0or another week.- Lithuania.   Encounters have still been taking place between Poles anpTLithuanians in spite of armistice arranged for 13th September.   Polish and Lithuanian delegates to decide on the demarcation line met at Kalvariya on 16th September. It is considered, however, that no satisfactory agreement will be concluded.
SOUTH   RUSSIA,Extensive anti-Bolshevik risings are reported in the Nikolaev district and Nikopol *   Wrangel&apos;s forces have carried out successful operations in Crekhov district. Wrangel does not intend to carry out any operations in Ukraine as he considers the means at his disposal to he insufficient.Azerbaijan.\     The reign of teror in Baku increases as the BolsheviEs grow more nervous5 and executions amongst the bourgeoisie are numerous-   The Italians are in hicrh favour.Enver Pasha is reported at Baku and Nouri and Khalil at Erzeroum.   Radek and Zin.sviev have left Baku for Moscow. Reliable information states that the Bolsheviks have sent ten poods of gold (about 1/2 million  ) through Baku to Mustapha Kemal.SIBERIA. .Anti-Bolshevik risings are reported in Irkutsk and Omsk districts; these risings have been ruthlessly suppressed.The evacuation of Czechs from Vladivostock is now complete.G B R M A N Y.The Council of Ambassadors decided that, in order to replace six Zeppelins destroyed in violation of the terms of the Armistic and the Treaty of Versailles, the German Govern-ment should surrender two civil.Zeppelins (30DENSES and NORDSTERN) already iryexistenoe and hand,over to the Allied Governments two out of every three commercial Zeppelins which&apos; Germany may build in future, until the tonnage of the des-troyed Zeppelins is made good.AUSTRIA.Dr. Reuner stated at a political meeting that the question of the union of Austria and Germany is to be bnought up in November before the League of Nations.   The alternative proposal of Austria joining the Danube Confederation would appear to have been abandoned.. HUNG A R Y.The economic conditions of Hungary are in a bad way. The people are, however, determined to consolidate the State and its credit and there is every indication of a keen desire to work.     In some of the mines the output has almost reached its pre-war level.\SOVIET   RUSSIA.    (Contd.)The Central Executive at Moscow ratified peace with Lithuania on 9th September, 1920.
OZBOHO     SLOVAKIA.The President has&quot; accepted tho resignation of the Government,   The New Cabinet is under the leadership of 11,Czerny who belongs to no political part;/.  ;The Cabinet is only intended to carry on until the Social Democrats have settled their differences.NETHERLANDS.The butch V/ar glister has introduced a bill for the re-organization and reduction o1 the Dutch army.   In place of the existing 23,000&apos;menJ he proposes a yearly levy of 13,000 who shall serve 6 months instead of sir*it and twelve.italy as regards the recent seizure of factories the majority of manufacturers oppose any surrender o-&quot; the rights of owners to-administrate their own property, but the minority would accept Government Control.A BOLOGNA message states that railwaymen and sailors have decided to deliver to the seizers all raw materials arriving at Italian Ports.JUGO   SLAVIA.The Jugo Slav Government is prepared to receive 9,000 Russian refugees if Great Britain is willing to pay  120,000 for expenses of installing such a colony, and, subsequently,  80,000 a month for its expenses.TURKEYReports have been received at CONSTANTINOPLE that SOVIET RUSSIA is sending war material from NOVOROSSISK to TRSBI20ND for the Nationalists.A most serious financial position prevails in Turkey. The Government is penniless and owes one or more months1 salary to all its officials and employees.   To prevent riot and violence the Grand Vizier is attempting to raise money,, but no security can be offered by him, as the Treaty denies TURKEY the power of mortgaging any source of revenue without the sanction of the Allied Finance Commission, which does not exist as yet.Under tho circumstances, it is proposed that a Public Debt Council shall be appointed by the Allies to ;l.,al with this crisis, which may at any moment bring about a total dislocation of all the public services.A recently captured document states that the Bolsheviks intend to employ&apos; Turkish commanders to lead the revolutionary movement in the East, with ENVER as C-in-C, DJHMAL is to be in oa: and on the /Afghanistan front and EHALIL PASHA on the&apos; Persian front.   KHALIL, who was conveying gold to MUSTAHIA KIl-iAL, recently arrived at. the Turkish frontier from MOSCOW.The Committee of Union and Progress has now placed   -MUSTAPHA KEI1AL at its head.
*-     ^    a**ARMENIA.The agreement &quot;between Armenia and Soviet Russia, whereby the former agreed to a temporal:/ occupation by Bolshevik troops of the Karabagh and Zangezur districts, and of the Southern portion of the Nakhichevan district, has changed the entire situation.   Instead of an effective &quot;Buffer between Soviet Azerbaijan and Mustapha Kemal, in the shape of the Armenian army, the entire area contiguous to Persian and Turkish territory has been placed at the disposal of Soviet Russia for military operations *   The Soviet authori-ties are thus in a position to.carry out their promise of troops and material to Mustapha Kemal.BELGIUMThe Franco-*Belgian Military Convention is now definition-itely in force.   It is probable that the two Governments con-cerned will not consent to coiisminicate the terms to the League of Nations, on the ground that the nature of tho con-mention makes its secrecy imperative.PORTUGALLourenoo Marques.    There is little change in the situation.   &quot;About 230 strikers employees of the port and railway, have been arrested by the Government, and will be tried by a military court.CHINAIt is reported that the EUANGSI Faction in the South is in danger of extinction owing to the military action of. its adversaries.    This compromises the hopes of a settlement between North and South, which have been built on the friend-ship between the EUANG3I and-vCHIHLI Factions, the latter of wMch dominates PEKIN.It is also stated that the reported disbandment of troops is in reality a transference of troops from the defeated ANFU Faction to the successful CHIHLI Faction.
