Housing Committee is circulated for the information of the Cabinet in accordance with the instructions of the Committee recorded therein.
Extract from .the-Minutes of the 8th Meeting of-^aHaouidri^OJtteeheld on September 10th t lrJ 0VISED The Committee had before them the revised proposalsOPCHLSt HI-       of the Government in regard to the increase of building E/iSIMCILDIMO      labour, in the form of a letter addressed by the Ministry BOUi;.of Health to the Resettlement Commit tew or the Building:Industrial Council (H.C.35), together with a reply of the resettlement Committee (H.C.3?).   The Chairman explainedthat the original proposals of the Housing Committee, as approved by the Cabinet, had been considered at a conference with the Resettlement Committee at the Board o; Trade onAugust 17th, but the Resettlement Committee had been unableto agree to them, and in consequence the revised proposals puthad been/forward by the Government.PREHTICEf The Resettlement Committee were prepared toIIP SCHK-Ib)R EX-        accept the new proposals in so far only that they would iKVICE MEM.. &apos;agree to a system of adult apprenticeship under which ex-service men between the ages of 19 and 26 would be admitted to apprenticeship, at a ware of 50/: of a full journeyman1s wage.   This was the only concession the trade was prepared to make in return for the Government&apos;s offer of a guaranteed week.   They would not agree to any proposals for payment by . results, nor would they agrve to the employment of unskilled labour on elementary -building work.The Chairman pointed out to the Committee that the proposals amounted to very littlu in substance, and it was for the Committee to decide whether they were worth acceptance by the Government.   If the Government did not think them adequate, the only alternative was for the Office of Works to engage ex-service men, and proceed wit out regard to the Trade Union rules.It was stated ^n behalf of the Ministry of Health I that the ftppren&apos; ceship offer would be sufficiently attract-ive to induce - large number of ex-service men to come in, but considerable doubt was felt as to the proportion of apprentices, to skilled men to which the individual Trades
Unions would agree.   Tho Resettlement Committee had said that they contemplated a proportion of 1 in 4 a3 an average throughout the trade which might mean 1 in 5 in special cases. No figure was mentioned in the report of the Resettlement Committee, which stated that the Committee felt that the matter ihould be settled by negotiation between employers and operatives, rather than by any hard and fast proportion.In the opinion of the Ministry of Health tho real reason it had been impossible to secure an agreement on the question of payment by results was that the employers as well as the men were doing so well under existing conditions, that there was no inducement for the former to seek a quarrel with labour over this question, and it was imp^jbable that the Government would have the support of the employers in the svent of issue being joined on this.The offer of the Government of a guaranteed week was not wefcth nearly so much to the men as had been supposed, inasmuch as the guaranteed week was already in operation practically all ^ver the country in one form or another.   Em-ployers had been obliged lo grant it in order to keep their men.   Under the terms of the Resettlement Committee^ reply, the Government would merely agree to the principle of the guaranteed week, leaving the details to be negotiated be-tween the employers and men.
$he OoMJfctee agreed x(X)   *Po Request tho Ministry of f&amp;alth, in tjonoultatioa with tho Chairman;, to write to tho Resettlement Committee of tho Building Industrial Counoil, that(1) tho Government while prepared to v,ooept tho terms sot out in tho reply of the Hosettlement Committee, so -frir us they went t,ore muoh disappoint ed at the meagre results of the negotiations) and very much regretted that that Committee had not seen their way to go any further.) (s) that the Government must not he regarded as being content with the proposals, and desired it to ho ur,dGr** stood that they hold themselves entirely free to press for an extension of Trade Union rules, whore over and when ever they thought fit*(g)   To instruct the Secretary to report the ahow decision to tho Cabinet for their information.?B, Whitehall Gardens, S*Y/*1* 10th September, 1920*
