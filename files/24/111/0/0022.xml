p,l 8 22This Document is the Property of his Cri tannin f&apos;1?i.?S^&apos;,0        nent.---------------.........Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.7f;iA!.;      -&apos;----;---SECRET.&quot;Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to Secretary of State for India,dated 30th August 1920.Situation northern part of Arbil Division is very precarious. Surchi Kurds from Aqra district roused by escaped prisoner, notorious mischief maker, Nuri Agha, have captured Batas and are attacking Rovvanduz, which is held by levies under British officer (s).Situation Kirkuk Division has been improved (by) military action, but is still delicate. No fresh developments in Salaimaniyeh, but Bolshevik success in north-west Persia will have reflex (effect) here. Situation of Hit, Ramadi and Fallujah satisfactory, thanks to active co-operation of Dulaim and Anaizali chiefs. No fresh developments on middle Euphrates, but chiefs show no inclination to negotiate, and fanaticism is on increase in Najaf and Kerbela, where new chief mujtahid, Sheikh Ush Sharia, is issuing appeals to tribesmen to join Jehad.Situation Muntafiq Division is disquieting. Active preaching of Jehad by emissaries from Najaf and Kerbela has at last roused tribesmen to whom political catchwords had made no appeal. Most important Sheikh in district, Khayun-al-Obaid, who owes none of his strength to us, but has since the armistice been strong supporter of civil administration (particularly during last two months), found himself unable to check spread of fanaticism among his tribe. Town and countryside exhibited every sign of hostility (? against) Assistant Political Officer and Levy Commandant, who were at last moment extricated by air. Assistant Political Officer, Capt. Thomas, is personally popular in district and exceptionally competent, but this fact did not prevent growth of fanatical feeling, and only (timely) arrival cf aeroplane (? s) saved either his life or that of Assistant Political Officer, Qalat Sikar.Trend of events in Muntafiq Division are (sic) having unfavourable effect on public order in Hammar Lake and on lower Euphrates, and we may be obliged (? before) long to depend on railway in place of river communication to Nasiriyeh. No fresh developments elsewhere, but re-occupation of Baqubah and result of recon-naissance to Qizil Robat yesterday, I hope, portends (sic) early improvement in Diyalah Division.Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to Secretary of State for India,dated 31st August 1920.Situation continues to deteriorate. Jehad is spreading to Suq district and position in Samara division is increasingly difficult. Samara has been attacked by tribesmen; townspeople are with us, but weak. Railway to Mosul has been interrupted for a week now, which has a bad effect on public mind.10   2203     100  9.20A
