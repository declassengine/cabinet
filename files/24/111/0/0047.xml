On June 15th the Minister of Pensions and I placed before the Cabinet a memorandum suggesting that in view ofthe increased cost of living a bonus should be paid ondisability pensions and allowances payable to disabled ex-service men in training,^ In a further paper, CP. 1508,I drew attention to a particular case of hardship, via.,that of a single man living at home and supporting a widowedmother whilst under training, and suggested that a paymentshould be made in respect of a dependant widowed mother at i*a rate corresponding to the wifels allowance, i.e., 10/-a week.   (Copies of-thes^^^ Sincethe date of these two memoranda the reasons which appeared to make an improvement in the rate of allowances necessary have, in my view become even more urgent, and as the Bread Subsidy has now been definitely withdrawn the matter comes up for further consideration in accordance with the Cabinet decision of 5th July,2.       The present scale of allowances was adopted in August, 1919, and was based upon the recommendations of the Select Committee on Pensions.     The Select Committee, however, in suggesting the scale, recommended that the scale should be made to vary proportionately with the cost of living.     The Government, while adopting the scale, did not adopt the second part of the recommendation, but stipulated that the new scale should be regarded as fixed until March, 1923.
The present position is therefore that while the ooet of living&apos; between August, 1919, and August, 1920 has advanced 40 points, i.e., 155 points in 1920 as against 115 points in 1919 over pre-war prioes, the rates of pensions and training allowances have remained unchanged. At the same time the disabled ex-servioe man, conscious of continuously successful agitations in all directions for higher wages, is not -Without good grounds, seriously discontented to find his fixed income less and less adequate for purchasing the bare necessities of life. &apos; 3.        Burnerous and emphatic memorials from disabled men reach me week by week impressing upon me the hardship of their position, of which indeed tho personal investigation of many cases has already convinced me,.       The present scale of allowances in my opinion affords a just ground for the acute irritation that I fear undoubtedly exists among certain sections of ex-service men.     It is not necessary to emphasise the serious danger which lies in the existence of this core of active discontent during the industrial depression whioh must certainly be anticipated this winter,     I am therefore impelled on the grounds not only of justice but also of expediency, to press upon the Cabinet once more the desirability of making some general increase in the scale of allowances, and to suggest the adoption of the original Bonus proposal as set out in the Joint Memorandum of 15th June. 4.        I&apos;am aware of the pressing need for economy at the present time,     I am equally certain, however, that the public conscience demands that the reasonably generous treatment of the disabled ex-service man should be the first charge upon the public- purse.     In whatever other direction expenditure must be cut down, the expenditure upon pensions should be the last item of public expenditure to be affected by. economy.      The sensitiveness of public
opinion regarding ex-servioe men may easily be gauged from the reception which has been accorded to Lord Haigrs recent appeal.5.     The suggestion made in my memorandum of the 22nd June, 0.P.15O8, regarding the payment of a dependants1 allowance in respect of a widowed mother dependant upon an ex-service man who is in training whilst living at home is, compared with the general question sot forth above, a point of detail.     It is nevertheless in my view of considerable importance since the grievance is acute and provides a continual source of irritation and fruitful material for agitation.    The present financial position of the disabled single man in training at home and supporting a widowed mother is one of peculiar hardship which I am quite unable to defend.    A concession to meet such cases would produce I am certain an excellent effect at comparatively small cost.   I accordingly press that such a concession be made on the understanding that the allowance will not be paid in respect of a dependant other than a widowed mother.T. &apos; J.   MACMMARA. -iOth September, 1920.
