&apos; ins Document iv      n Lii0n,.  ---------i^JiElH QfjQ\gga3^ted by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.I circulate to my colleagues copies of telegraphic correspondence with India in regard to the movement in favour of emigration to Afghanistan, which is anoutcome of the Khilafat agitation in India.18th August 1920.E. S.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 12th August 1920.Muhajarin movement. At outset emigrants came from poorer classes with sprinkling of intelligentsia chiefly from towns, but movement has since spread to other&apos; classes. In North- West Frontier Province Peshawar has been seriously affected as, owing to geographical position, it has. received concentrated stream of Muhajarin. About 18,000 emigrants are reported to have left province, chiefly from Peshawar district, up to date. Important Pathan agricultural classes, including, it is said, some persons of good family, are leaving lands uncultivated and emigrating. (? Hazara) and Kohat also affected. Religious excitement caused by stream of emigrants has begun to affect Government servants. One batch of emigrants included six sepoys and one havildar, who were allowed to cut their names, and there have been some resignations from police and other services. Kacha Garhi incident, synchronising with arrival of large number of Muhajarin from Sind in special train, gave stimulus to movement in Frontier Province, where it is encouraged by wildest rumours alleging occupation of Mecca and Medina by British troops, desecration of Kaaba, intended billeting of British troops on villages, with threatened outrage of women. The movement has also been encouraged by speculators who are exploiting rural landowning classes, buying up land and crops at fictitiously low prices. Chief Commissioner has issued statement drawing attention to absurdity of rumours and folly of emigration, and vigorous efforts are being made to bring all this home to the people.t. From Sind estimated 1,000 have emigrated. Ninety-five per cent, of main party labourers, loafers, and broken men. Prominent men, with one exception, went only as far as Peshawar and then returned. Muhajarins said to be affected by rumours current:  (a) Their religion was being interfered with, (b) Study of Koran prohibited by Government: (c) Sunday instead of Friday to be fixed for philan-thropists&apos; prayer clay. Religious enthusiasm observed, but little sign of bitterness. At present no importance attached to movement, which is regarded as window dressing, but rumours above being widely contradicted, and Commissioner endeavouring to get leading Pirs to deprecate emigration.Effect (a) prohibition of special trains for Muhajarins, (b) prosecution of Pir .Mahbub Shah, (c) reported ill-treatment of certain Muhajarins in Afghanistan, remains to be seen, but GandhPs speech in&apos; Hyderabad reported to have given some fillip to movement and much depends on success attending non-co-operation movement generally.3. Punjab report that some 500 emigrants have proceeded from that province, but others have gone quietly, and Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province, estimates actual number of Muhajarins from Punjab at 2,000. Punjab Muhajarins chiefly from cities, owning no land, and having nothing to lose by venture. Few agriculturalists gone from villages no men of importance yet emigrated. Movement at present of little importance and likely to subside unless wave of enthusiasm in Peshawar extends to Punjab and Sind Muhajarins pass through Punjab in large numbers latter contingency unlikely, as special trains prohibited.4. At one time Hi j rat movement, connected as it is with Khilafat agitation, seemed likely to assume serious proportions, but there are indications of a check. Moreover, Afghan authorities themselves showing alarm at invasion, and must for economic reasons put stop to it before long. They are already said to be placing restrictions in way of intending Muhajarins. We have not interfered with movement so far, because we believe that, as in most religious revivals, enthusiasm would only 2118-1    . 100 8 20
be stimulated by repression, and will exhaust itself if left alone. Emigrants will find life in Afghanistan intolerable, and numbers will return disheartened and discourage others from going. We have had unverified report that this has already happened in case of some Punjab emigrants. Further, Afghanistan cannot afford to support and feed emigrants on this scale. So far they have been well received, but they are burden on villages on Kabul road, and it is reported that their entertainment at Jabal-us-Siraj, where they are concentrated, is very poor. At the same time, collec-tion of these large numbers of emigrants in North-West Frontier Province, and religious excitement engendered thereby, are cause of serious unrest, and may give rise to disorder which might spread to Northern India. The danger also arising out of the close historical connection between Hijrat Jehad cannot be ignored.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 15th August 1920.Following communique regarding Hijrat movement was issued by Chief Cpm-missiorier and Agent to the Governor-General, North-West Frontier Province, on 13th instant:&apos;- &quot;A few days ago, Political Agent, Khyber, wrote to Sarhaddar Dakka, asking him if he could arrange to receive convoy of Muhajirin every day of week instead of on caravan days only in order to obviate congestion. Sarhaddar Dakka has replied in letter dated 12th August that as road is congested with Muhajirin and their transport, and as i the arrangements for those who have already arrived are incomplete, has ordered absolute postponement of emigration movement till further orders, and no-emigrants will be allowed admittance to Afghanistan. Local Khilafat and Hijrat Committees in North-West Frontier Province Lave been informed with a view to their warning and stopping intending emigrants. It would be well if Khilafat and Hijrat Committees take similar action to obviate loss and trouble to intending emigrants.&quot;Following telegram received from Chief Commissioner 14th instant has been published for general information :  &quot; Parties of over 7,000 Muhajirin had left Peshawar for Jamaud on 12th August. Receipt-of Sarhaddar Dakkas letter saying Amir desired postponement of Hijrat. Accordingly Khilafat Committee at once despatched emissaries and volunteers to Jamaud to inform Muhajirin and bring them back.   Muhajirin, however, refused to accept orders and showed great truculence towards emissaries, saying that Khilafat Committee had obviously been bribed.    Attitude of Muhajirin towards British authorities was perfectly orderly and. correct, as usual:    Afghan  Agent from Peshawar himself then went out to try and dissuade them from proceeding, but was stoned and had to return.   They were allowed therefore to proceed to Landi Kotal yesterday.   Haji Jan Muhammad, Secretary of Khilafat Committee, and others proceeded yesterday to boundary and discussed matters with Afghan officials and returned to Landi Kotal and did their best to dissuade Muhajirin, who again showed great truculence, calling emissaries kaffirs.   Vanguard of Muhajirin reached boundary, at seven this morning and were met by Sarhaddar Dakka and Afghan Commandant, with guard of 50 men, who told them they could not come on.   Parleying continued for about an hour and a half, by which time main body of Muhajirin had arrived, and were threatening to break -down barriers.   Thereupon, Sarhaddar Dakka who had communicated with General Nadir Khan by telephone, said they would admit Muhajirin if they could pay their own expenses.   They were accordingly allowed to pass through.   Khilafat Committee realising that they have aroused forces they cannot control, and are paralysed with fear of public, who are bitterly resentful at having thus been duped. &apos;I am putting strong pressure on them to face their responsibilities, and themselves close down a movement which they have raised to its present dimensions.   Meanwhile, the general atmosphere in both city and district is hourly improving.   There are, however, still elements of grave anxiety.   If possible, the-central Khilafat Committee should be moved to give wide publicity to the Amir&apos;s orders to his officials to refuse admittance to further emigrants in order to save poor-Moslems elsewhere from embarking on this ruinous adventure.&quot;
