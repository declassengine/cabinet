j\JFI-dEN^4^L. From - Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 2328ilh. September 1920.(Received 5th, 2 p.m.)-1073 S. A somewhat critical hot weather has&apos;now terminated, during which anxiety was felt as to effect which internal agitation over Turkish peace terms and Hunter Committee^ Report might have upon the frontier tribes and upon our relations with Afghanistan. Present, therefore, seems favourable opportunity for -reviewing frontier and Afghan situation. In early spring there was excitement among Mohmands and Afridis, caused by rumours on frontier of approaching renewal of hostilities with Afghanistan. This excitement seems to have been fostered by some Afghan frontier officials who desired to retain their influence over tribesmen on British side of frontier. During course of conference with Afghan delegates at Mussoorie, when it became apparent that both British and Afghan Governments were sincerely desirous of friendly relations, tribal excitement died down and behaviour of Afridis throughout hot weather1 was satisfactory, being unaffected even by spectacle of passage through Khyber of large number of emigrants from India, who had been deluded by agitators into seeking refuge in Afghanistan. Amir&apos;s announcement in August that no &apos; more Indian emigrants could he admitted into Afghanistan, together with reports of hardships encountered by those already there, produced great revulsion of feeling which was assisted by sympathetic attitude of British authorities towards returning emigrants. Meanwhile there had been prolonged agitation in Hazara District north-east of Peshawar which communicated itself to Black Mountain tribes on Hazara border, and resulted at the end of August in open demonstrations of disloyalty in Hazara and in attacks by some of the Black Mountain tribesmen on military camp at Oghi. This agitation was quelled - by the arrest of the two principal agitators and by complete repulse, of Black Mountain tribesmen. All is now reported quiet in this quarter. Further south in Waziristan announcement of our intentions to occupy central Mahsud country for indefinite period and to extend communications, has been calmly received : and Mahsud have paid up almost the whole fine imposed on them in cash and rifles. The Afghan border population is now quiet, and there is every sign that most of Afghan people desire complete restoration of former friendship with British Govern-ment. This desire should have its effect on deliberations of Afghan Government now proceeding at Kabul regarding their future attitude towards the British Govern-ment as result of Mussoorie Conference. Reports of Bolshevik excesses against Mussulmans of Caucasus and of Bolshevik plans to overthrow Amir of Bokhara, together with recent mutiny of Afghan troops in Afghan Turkestan, are believed to have,opened the eyes of Afghans to dangers Avhich they would court by too intimate relations with Soviet Government and by permitting entry of Bolshevik agitators on to.Afghan soil on ostensible plea of desiring to promote agitation in India. There is, therefore, on the whole, little reason for uneasiness regarding Frontier and. Afghan situation. - .
