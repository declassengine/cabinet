/ fThis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government   502SECRET.,w     3THE CABINET.DESPATCH OP CERTAIN MILITARY STORES TO POLAND.In the absence of the Secretary *of State for War, the following memorandum by the General Staff on the despatch of certain military stores already sanctioned as a    go&amp;T&quot; free gift to Poland is circulated.H. J. CBEEDY.The War Office,l%ih September, 1920.1. In October, 1919, the Cabinet * sanctioned a free gift to the Poles of certain stores, equipment, ammunition, &amp;c. Some of these munitions have been removed to Poland, but others still remain in this country, notably a large quantity of artillery, guns and ammunition, including the ammunition for the field guns already despatched, The munitions are really now the property of the Polish Government, which has expended money on the provision of packing cases, &amp;c. The guns and ammunition are now stored in British military dep6ts, and in the present circumstances the Army Council did not consider that they were justified in handing them over to the Polish shipping agents without Cabinet approval.2. The Secretary of State for War was, however, prepared to give orders for the issue to proceed, provided the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed. Lord Curzon was communicated with, and considers that &quot;expediency of permitting the Polish Government to lift the remainder of these goods is a question of internal rather than of foreign politics,&quot; and suggests that the matter be brought before the Cabinet for decision.3. The General Staff recommend that the transaction be completed, and the munitions removed by the Polish shipping agents.. * War Cabinet, No. 631 (4). Compare the following statement by Mr. Bonar Law in tbe House of Commons on 17th May, 1920 :-&quot; In October of last year, when it was feared that the Russian Border States would be attacked by the Soviet Government, a request was addressed by the Polish Government for assistance in their military equipment. In consequence of our commitments elsewhere the British Government were unable to give any financial assistance, but they offered to supply a certain quantity of surplus jstores on condition that the cost of moving them as well as the arrangements for transport should be undertaken by the Polish Government. This offer was accepted, and in consequence of this gift the material in question became the property of the Polish Government and part of it is now being shipped by that Government. Beyond this no assistance has been, or is being given, to the Polish Government. . . . The bargain was made, the material was actually given to the Polish Government, it is their property, and to have gone back on it would have been to break a bargain.  ...&quot;(B20/390)   100  9/20   H&amp;S, Ltd  8555-sto
