CP. 1824.&apos; QejCABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION: CONFERENCE ON SEAMEN, GENOA, JUNE-JULY 1920.Memorandum by Sie Montague Barlow and Mr. C. Hipwood, the BritishGovernment Delegates.WE submit for the information of the Cabinet the appended Report on the International Labour Conference held at Genoa, in June and July last, to deal with the conditions of employment of seamen.The Ministry of Labour is in consultation with the Government Depart-ments responsible for the administration of the subjects dealt with in the Draft Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the Conference, and in due course we propose to submit to the Cabinet a detailed Report containing specific recommendations with regard thereto.This procedure is in accordance with that found convenient in the case of the Conference held in Washington in November last (see C.P.-377 and 595).C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW. C. HIPWOOD.September 15, 1920.Report.1. The International Labour Conference which assembled at Genoa on the 15th June last was the second Conference held under the authority of the Labour Clauses of the Peace Treaty. Unlike its predecessor, the Washington Conference, which dealt with various industries, the Genoa Conference was devoted exclusively to the affairs of seamen. This was in accordance with the original French Resolution adopted by the Organising Committee in Paris early in 1919, viz., that the special questions relating to seamen should be dealt with at a Conference devoted exclusively to the affairs of seamen ; and this course was reaffirmed at the Washington Conference in November 1919.2. The items on the Agenda as circulated to the Governments which are&apos; members of the International Organisation were four in number : (1.) &quot;Application to seamen of the Convention drafted at Washington last November, limiting the hours of work in all industrial undertakings, including transport by sea, and under conditions to be determined, transport by inland waterways, to 8 hours in the day and 48 in the week.Consequential effects as regards manning and the regulations relating to accommodation and health on board ship.(2.) Supervision of articles of agreement. Provision of facilities for finding employment for seamen. Application to seamen of the Convention and Recommendations adopted at Washington in November last in regard to unemployment and unemployment insurance.(3.) Application to seamen of the Convention adopted at Washington prohibiting the employment of children under 14 years of age.(4.) Consideration of the possibility of drawing up an International Seamen&apos;s Code.&quot;.3. In accordance with the procedure established for the Washington Conference, Questionnaires on each item of the Agenda were circulated in February last to all[4237] B
members of the International Labour Organisation, with a view to providing the Bureau International du Travail and the Conference with information as to the practices and proposals of each Government in relation to the subjects on the Agenda, and securing a basis for discussion at the Conference.4. The replies which the British Government made to the Questionnaires were drafted by the Ministry of Labour after inter-departmental consultation with the Board of Trade, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry - of Agriculture and Fisheries and other Departments concerned.5. Following the Washington precedent, the Director of the International Labour Office, M. Albert Thomas, on behalf of the Bureau, prepared reports on each item of the Agenda, analysing and summarising the replies received from the Governments and presenting as a result certain conclusions and draft Conventions or Recommendations to form a basis for discussion at the Conference. Unfortunately, owing to the late arrival of certain replies, reports were not available until the eve of the Conference; while the important draft Convention on Hours was not in the hands of Delegates till some days after the Conference had commenced. We were thus under the disadvantage of not being able to take the instructions of the Cabinet upon the draft Conventions which we were called upon to debate.6. The Conference assembled on the 15th June and ended on the 10th July; it was welcomed to Genoa by the Governmental, military and civic authorities. The Hospitality Committee, consisting of prominent local residents, which had been established some time previously, did all in its power to make our stay as pleasant as possible.Twenty-seven States* were represented, some by Government delegates (or by 1 Government delegate) only, although under the terms of the Treaty each member of the organisation is entitled to be represented at Conferences by 4 persons, viz., 2 Government delegates, 1 representative of pmployers and 1 of workpeople. In some cases the limited representation was due to the absence of any national organisa-tions from which the industrial delegates could be selected in accordance with Article 389 of the Treaty, The United States of America, not being signatories to the Covenant of the League of Nations, were not represented at this Conference. South Africa and New Zealand, although signatories to the Covenant, also abstained from taking part. Fewer States sent delegates to the Genoa Conference than to the previous one at Washington, when representatives of 38 States attended; but, with the exception of the United States, the principal maritime Powers took part in the proceedings.7. The business of the Conference was regulated by the Treaty and by the Standing Orders which had been approved at Washington. Baron Mayer des Planches, the representative of Italy on the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, was, on the motion of Great Britain, elected president, vice-presidents being selected from each of the three groups, viz., M. Arthur Fontaine (French Government), M. Nijgh (Dutch shipowner), Mr. Havelock Wilson (British seamen).8. Two standing Committees were at once set up, viz., the Selection Committee and Credentials Committee, both with English-speaking chairmen, viz., the senior British Government Delegate, Sir Montague Barlow, and Mr. William Leslie (Australia, Shipowner)&quot; respectively. The Selection Committee was the general organising committee of the Conference, and regulated throughout the order of its business. The Credentials Committee examined the documents of appointment and dealt with protests respecting the composition of certain delegations. A serious complaint with regard to the composition of the German Seamen&apos;s Delegation was made by Mr. Havelock Wilson on behalf of the British seamen. The German seamen were represented by a former Minister of Economics, whose title to speak for seamen was contested, and their technical advisers included a certain Herr Doring, who was stated to have defended unrestricted submarine warfare.9. It appeared likely at one sta^e of the proceedings that the British Seamen&apos;s* Argentine, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chili, Czecho-Slovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, ^Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Siam, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, Venezuela. Of the 27 States represented at the Genoa Conference, 1 (Finland) had no voting rights, while 7 States, viz., Chili, Finland, Poland, Siam, Switzerland, Venezuela and Uruguay, were represented by Government delegates only. Six Governments, viz., Argentine, Chili, Portugal, Roumania, Venezuela and Uruguay, appointed 1 representative only, instead of the 2 permitted by the Treaty. One State, the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, had 2 Government and 1 seamen&apos;s delegate, but no shipowners&apos; delegate. The maximum number of delegates accredited to the Conference was 86, of whom 2, the Finnish Government delegates, as stated above, had no vote, and 1, the Serbian seamen&apos;s delegate, could not vote by reason of the absence of a shipowners&apos; repre-sentative from his national delegation. ,
Delegation and their sympathisers would leave the Conference unless the two Germans withdrew, but ultimately the dispute was adjusted; as a result the Germans tendered an expression of regret, and an. undertaking (in line with the terms of the Reparation Clauses of the Peace Treaty), to compensate the victims of submarine warfare.10. After several days of general preliminary discussion, the Conference in accordance with its Standing Orders set up four additional Commissions, consisting of representatives of the three groups, i.e., Government, Shipowners and Seamen, to deal with each of the items on the Agenda and to examine and report upon the draft conventions or recommendations which the Bureau had prepared. It was decided at an early sitting of the Conference and on the suggestion of the English seamen&apos;s representative that the case of men employed on fishing vessels should not be dealt with at Genoa, and a recommendation was subsequently adopted that it should be left to each nation to enact legislation limiting the hours of all workers employed in the fishing industry. It was also decided to refer to a special commission the consideration of the question whether workers on inland waterways should be brought under the provisions of any convention applicable to maritime seamen. The complete list of Commissions set up is as follows :- -Commission on Credentials     ...   President: Mr. Leslie(Australia).Commission of Selection        ...   President: Sir Montague Barlow -(Great Britain). Commission on Hours of Labour   President: Mr. Hipwood(Great Britain).Commission on Unemployment...   President: Sir Montague Barlow(Great Britain). Commission on the Minimum Age   President: Mr. Sokalfor Employment of Children (Poland).at Sea.Commission on the International President: Mr. Hudson, Legal Code for Seamen. Adviser of the Conference(United States of America). Commission on Inland Navigation   President: Mr. Robb(Canada).A Drafting Committee was also appointed in accordance with the Standing Orders.11. We intend, as soon as possible, to submit to the Cabinet a detailed report on the results of the Conference, with proposals framed in conjunction with the Departments concerned, for taking action, by ratification or otherwise, on the Conven-tions and Recommendations adopted by the Conference. A list of those Conventions and Recommendations and a summary of the voting thereon are given below.It may be convenient, however, at this stage, to indicate briefly the decisions of the Conference with respect to each item on the Agenda.12. Item No. 1: Hours of Labour. This was the most important and most contentious item on the Agenda. The seamen and shipowners in England had been holding conferences almost continuously for two or three months up to the end of May to try and arrive at a settlement on hours. We started for Genoa on the 11th June, and in the week prior to that they had held two or three conferences at St. Mary Axe. At the first of these the attitude taken up by the seamen was, we understand, reasonable, but later they turned down all proposals and refused to accept anything but a flat 48 hours for all deck hands and, apparently, stewards, and also for engineers. The position of the owners roughly was that they were prepared to accept three watches, but with two days in the middle of the week of 12 hours, making the hours worked 64.13. Under these circumstances we had to proceed to Genoa really to try and work out an agreement between our seamen and shipowners in the confused atmosphere of an international conference where the votes of Switzerland, Serbia, Czecho-Slovakia, Venezuela, Chili, and other small nations, were to count for as much as those of the great maritime Powers. .14. It was very unfortunate that the Washington Convention on Hours contained contradictory provision as to shipping.   Shortly, the confusion arose in this way : (a.) As mentioned above, the original French Resolution adopted by the Organising Committee in Paris early in 1919 provided that the very special questionsv       [4237] B 2
concerning the maritime conditions to be accorded to seamen should be dealt with at a special conference confined to the affairs of seamen.(6.) The draft of a Convention on Hours, circulated prior to the Washington Conference, included in the definition of &quot; Industrial Undertakings&quot; to which the Convention was to apply: &quot; The transport of passengers or goods by road or rail, including the handling of goods at docks, quays,&quot; &amp;c.(c.) The Bureau, when issuing report on hours prior to the Washington Conference summarising the replies of Governments to the Questionnaire and containing the Draft Convention quoted in (6) above, stated expressly in the preface: &quot; Commerce, agriculture and the sea service, and other non-industrial employments, have not been enquired into by the Committee or dealt with in this report.&quot;(d.) During the Washington discussions in the Commission on Hours, the labour delegates managed to get the definition of transport extended by the insertion of the words &quot; sea or inland waterways&quot; so as to run as follows: &quot; Transport of passengers or goods by road, rail, sea or inland water-ways, including the handling of goods at docks, quays, &amp;c.&quot;15. When the Committee draft came up before the Conference strong protest was made by representatives of Canada, Sweden and Norway against the extension of the definition on the ground that such insertion was ultra vires, that maritime questions had been expressly excluded from that Conference, and no maritime experts were present. It was made a matter of comment at Genoa that no similar protest was raised at Washington by the representatives of Great Britain, the country mainly affected. Labour at Washington pressed strongly that the words &quot; sea or inland waterways &quot; should be allowed to remain in the definition, and as a compromise this was conceded, a clause being added that :-&quot;The provisions relative, to transport by sea and on inland waterways shall be determined by a Special Conference.&quot;16. The result of this contradictory compromise as reflected in the discussions at Genoa was unfortunate : the men and the employers maintaining, each with consider-able ground, opposite interpretations of the Washington Convention and its effect on maritime hours. The situation we had to deal with at Genoa was difficult enough without this unnecessary complication. But it at any rate made our duty clear, viz., to see that we in our turn gave our adhesion to no provision of an obscure or uncertain character.17. The important Commission on Hours began its work at the beginning of the week, 21st June, with a discussion of the Draft Convention, Article 1, as prepared by the Bureau.   It was very difficult to make out what this Article meant.   In terms it. seemed to suggest three alternatives : (a.) An 8 hours day, i.e., 56 hours a week ; or (b.) An 8 hours day with one day off&quot;, i.e., 48 hours a week; or (c.) If (a) is granted, then with compensations (either hours off or increased pay) so as to compensate for the 8 hours when 56 hours are worked instead of 48.At any rate this seemed the only way to read Article 1 so as to harmonise it with Article 2, which expressly suggested 56 hours on ocean-going steamers when at sea.18. Article 1 in this shape was liable to misunderstanding of all kinds. In our view, it was unfortunate that Article 1 ever figured in the draft at all. If the Draft Convention had started at Article 2, which embodied a concrete proposal for ocean-going steamers of 56 hours at sea and 48 hours in port, we should have had less difficulty.19. On Tuesday, 22nd June, the discussion of Article 1 began, and amendments were moved. Mr. McVey, for the seamen, made a long speech, in which he maintained that 48 hours had been granted at Washington, and that the only question they had to discuss was the application of that principle to seamen. Sir Alfred Booth took the opposite view, and criticised Mr. McVey&apos;s figures. Sir Alfred Booth proposed that Article 1 should be struck out and that they should then proceed to discuss the other Articles, but he did not press this to a division.20. On Wednesday morning, 23rd June, Mr. Barnes&apos;s letter to the &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; dated 4th June from the House of Commons, was read by the British
Shipowners to the effect that Washington did not commit anyone to 48 hours, and was ultra vires so far as the seamen were concerned. This again was contradicted by Mr. Cotter (who was replacing the British seamen&apos;s delegate), and by foreign seamen and others. A vote was next taken, that the 8-hour day and the 48-hour week be the rule to be adopted, i.e., adopted at once. For this; there was an even vote 15 for and 15 against; 5 Government Delegates (Great Britain, India, Norway, Sweden and Spain) and 9 Shipowners voted against it, and one Seaman Delegate from Japan. It is possible this last Japanese Seamans vote was a mistake. It is to be noted that all three French Delegates, Government, Shipowner and Seaman, voted in favour of the 8-hour day and 48-hour week immediately. The Chairman then suggested, (as there was no means of deciding this even vote of 15 against 15) that the whole of Article 1 as standing in the text should be put, provided that, if carried, it would then be subject to amendment. This was then carried by 17 to 13. This was, in the men&apos;s view, a victory for them, and they immediately took up a strong attitude.21. We were determined not to he responsible for any confusion. Accordingly, we drew up a short statement, which was read out by Mr. Hipwood at the fifth meeting on Wednesday afternoon, to the effect that &quot; The British Government Delegation, while they accepted fully the 8-hour day and the 48-hour week as the standard to be aimed at, were not able to agree to the immediate application of a 48 hours&apos; week to all British ships.&quot;22. On Thursday, 24th June, further amendments were discussed, the only one of importance being that on Lascars, an amendment being moved to add the words &quot; without distinction of nationality of race.&quot; Appeals had been made to us by the Indian representatives soon after our arrival at. Genoa for our assistance (on the express ground that India was under British control) in securing full representation for India on the various Commissions of the Conference ; and also in safeguarding the position of the Lascars. This assistance we readily promised. We had no doubt as to the harmful effect of the amendment above mentioned on the prospects of employment of Lascars : and in accordance with our instructions we supported the Indians in their opposition to this amendment, which was also opposed by Norway, Sweden and Spain and by 4 Shipowners&apos; Delegates.   It was, however, carried.23. On Friday, 25th, Mr. McVey, for the Seamen, moved a very comprehensive amendment to Article 1 as follows : &quot; The effective working hours of all persons of both sexes, of every age employed on board a vessel of whatever nature, public or private, including vessels used for the purposes of technical instruction, shall be limited to 8 hours in the day and to 48 hours in the week, the details for each country to be worked out in each country in the manner best suited for its own trade, and to be applied within the shortest possible time, with the understanding that work in port shall be on the 44 hours per week basis, that is, of 8 hours&apos; work for the first five days of the week and of 4 hours&apos; work on Saturday, in order to respect the English system regarding the Saturday afternoon.&quot;the object of which was to make 8 hours a day and 48 hours a week the rigid rule for everyone. This the French claimed they had already secured under their law. The McVey amendment also added 44 hours when in port, which the French admitted they had not yet got. This amendment, after discussion, was, to the surprise of the English seamen, defeated by 16 votes to 14, the voting being : For, 14- .Government; France, Holland, Italy. Shipowners: France. Seamen: All.Against, the Report says 16, but the names given only amount to 15, viz.:--Government: Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Spain.Shipowners: Great Britain, Canada, Holland, Japan, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Sweden.This defeat was undoubtedly a great surprise to the men, who had expected to be able to carry all before them.24. The Commission had now arrived at an impasse. The extremists wished the Conference %o terminate, but moderating influences were brought to, bear and a Sub-Committee of six was appointed by the Commission, to see on how many points[4237] B 3
agreement could be reached and what were the essential points of difference. Mr. Hipwood, as Chairman of the Hours Commission and on behalf of the -British Govern-ment, attempted to effect a compromise on the basis of the Cabinet instructions, viz., a 48 hours&apos; week for engineers and stokehold hands, a 56 hours&apos; week for deckhands and a week of not exceeding 70 hours for stewards,* the hours in port to be 44 weekly, which is approximately the present practice in this country. But this was rejected ; and the Draft Convention eventually submitted , to the Conference was framed on the lines of the French law, i.e., 48 hours (45 in port) for all, excluding officers, with &quot;compensa-tion &quot; of hours off, when in port, or extra payment, for anything over 48 hours each week worked at sea.25. When the Draft Convention came up for discussion in conference, Sir Montague Barlow made the position of the British Government clear, and formally moved amend-ments to the same effect as had been proposed to the Commission by Mr. Hipwood. These proposals proved too advanced for the shipowners, while the seamen did not think that they went far enough ; there was thus a considerable majority against them when they were put to the vote as an amendment to the Draft Convention. Eventually the draft failed in dramatic fashion by a fraction of a vote to secure the two-thirds majority required by the Peace Treaty for a Convention (Article 405). So the proposals dropped altogether.26. It is not necessary here to refer to the political and other considerations which secured for the Hours Convention, as eventually modified in Committee, not only the support of the seamen, but also the united vote of all the French Delegates, and also the votes of many of the delegates of the smaller nations with little or no shipping. An analysis of the voting is given elsewhere. It is perhaps sufficient to state here that some 10,980,000 tons of shipping was represented by the Governments voting for the Draft Convention, as against 25,570,000 tons sailing under the flags of the Governments whi:h could&apos;not give it their support.    s27. Item 2 of the Agenda relating to employment was divided for convenience into three parts : (a.) Articles of Agreement. (6.) Employment agencies, (c.) Insurance.28. (a.) Articles of Agreement. It was generally agreed that this subject in its broad aspects should be dealt with in the International Seamen&apos;s Code, when that Code comes to be prepared. No general convention or recommendation regarding Articles of Agreement was proposed by the Commission to whom the matter was referred, but in the Convention on Employment members ratifying that Convention agree (Article 5) that all the guarantees necessary for the protection of all parties concerned shall be provided in the Articles of Agreement, and that proper facilities shall be given to examine the Articles of Agreement before and after signing.29.--(b.) Employment Agencies. The Conference adopted a Convention containing provisions with regard to the business of finding employment analogous to the provisions on this subject made by the Washington Conference. With a view to abolishing &quot; Crimps,&quot; Article 1 declared that generally the business of finding employment for seamen should not be carried on by any person or agency for monetary gain, and such seamens agencies carried on commercially for a profit as are allowed to remain for tbe time being are to be placed under Government licence and inspection. This was accepted by the British Delegates after being assured by the Indian Delegates that the arrangements made by the Indian Government for the licensing and inspection of the paid agents or Serangs who negotiate the hiring of Lascars would fully and easily comply with this provision.The members ratifying the Convention agree by Article 2 to the establishment and maintenance of an efficient, adequate and gratuitous system of public employment offices for finding employment for seamen. Such system may be maintained either by representative associations of shipowners and seamen jointly under the control of a central authority, or, in the absence of such joint authority, by ohe State itself. Provision is made for the national co-ordination of existing employment offices of different types. Committees, representative of shipowners and seamen in equal numbers, are to be appointed to advise on matters concerning the carrying on of these employment offices.   Other provisions are also included, assuring respectively freedom* It is not clear that stewards as a whole really desire to reduce their earnings by an increase in their numbers on board ships.
of choice of ship to seamen and of crew to shipowners; and also free reciprocal use of these employment agencies as between the seamen nationals of all members &quot; when conditions of employment are approximately the same.&quot; The contract of engagement must contain all the necessary guarantees for protecting all parties concerned, and facilities for examining articles of agreement must be given before and after signing. Discretion is allowed to each Government as to whether the Convention shall be put in force as regards deck officers and engineer officers. -30. (c.) Insurance. A convention, recommendation and resolution were adopted.The Convention has the effect in principle of rendering the charterer or shipowner liable to pay an indemnity up to the amount of two months&apos; wages to seamen when out of employment as a result of loss on foundering of the ship.31. As regards insurance against unemployment in the ordinary sense, Governments are recommended to organise, either by means of direct legislation or by systems of subsidies, insurance against every case of involuntary idleness through lack of employment.32. The Resolution adopted is to the effect that the International Labour Office through its existing Technical Commission on Unemployment, and with the assistance of a joint Commission of Shipowners and Seamen, created at the Conference, should investigate the existing organisation of unemployment insurance for seamen, with the view of introducing improvements and making an effective international system.33. Item No. 3 of the Agenda: Minimum Age for Employment at Sea. The essential clause of the Convention adopted provide that children under 14 years of age shall not be employed or work on vessels other than vessels upon which members of the same family are employed. Vessels are defined to be ships and boats of any nature whatsoever engaged in maritime navigation, whether publicly or privately owned ; but to exclude ships of war. An exception is made in favour of work done by children on school ships or training ships, provided that such work is approved and supervised by public authority.34. An attempt was made by the Commission, to whom the subject was referred, to exceed the terms of the Agenda and to introduce clauses providing for a minimum age of 18 for employment as stokers or trimmers, and of 17 for employment on night watches. A protest was raised by the Japanese delegates on the ground that these clauses were ultra vires and exceeded the terms of the Agenda. It is. most important that the Conferences should adhere strictly to the rules of order ; and we supported this protest of the Japanese, which was accepted by the Conference.35. It should be noted that the Indian Government Delegates abstained from voting on this Convention.36. Item No. 4 : International Seamen s Code. On this matter being referred to a Commission, the opinion of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office that it was impossible within the time available at the Conference to deal with so complicated and intricate a subject was confirmed. The Commission came to the conclusion that codification of the existing national laws were a first step, and therefore recommended thatteach member of the International Labour Office should undertake the embodiment in a seamen&apos;.s code of all its laws and regulations relating to seamen &quot; in order that, as a result of the clear and systematic codification of the national law of each country, the seamen of the world .... may have a better comprehension of their rights and obligations.&quot; They had also proposed that the Conference should affirm by resolution the necessity and possibility of establishing such a code, and should direct the International Labour Office to make the necessary enquiries for the ^purpose, reporting progress, if possible, at the 1921 General Conference. A minority report of the Scandinavian seamen, framed in somewhat intemperate language and describing the status of seamen as little better than that of a &quot; serf,&quot; contained a resolution recommending the repeal of all laws and the abrogation of all treaties under which the seaman may be compelled to labour against his will when the vessel is in safety or suffer incarceration for refusing to fulfil a civil contract of labour.37. This latter resolution was subsequently redrafted, and, in its new form, laid down certain considerations to be borne in mind when preparing a seamen&apos;s code, viz., uniformity of provisions in national laws as regards the clauses of a public character; legal obligations of shipowners and seamen inter se arising out of the clause of a private character to be placed on a footing of strict equality; violations of provisions in contracts of engagement not to be dealt with as criminal offences unless they are offences against the public interest.38. In the result, the Conference was able to idopt both the Recommendations and the Resolutions. .        , ,

Against, 25 Governments, 13 votes, representing 7 States.Shipowners, 12 votes. Abstentions Governments, 4 (Finland, India, Switzerland, Kingdom of Serbs-Croats-Slovenes). Shipowners, 4 (Australia, Spain, India, Roumanian Seamen, 1 (Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom).The 16 Governments voting in favour of the Convention were as follows: Germany, Argentine, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chili, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Roumania, Sweden, Czecho-slovakia, Uruguay, Venezuela, representing 26 votes and 10,980,000 gross tons of shipping. The balance of the 48 votes was made up of 3 shipowners (Argentine, France, Netherlands) and all the&quot;seamen, totalling 19, entitled to vote at the Conference.The following Governments voted against the Convention: Denmark, Spain, Great Britain, Japan, Norway, Portugal and Siam, representing 13 votes and 25,570,000 gross tons of shipping.Representatives of shipowners of the following countries voted against the Convention and made up the 25 votes so cast: Germany, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Czecho-slovakia.f Distinction between Conventions and Recommendations.The distinction made in the Treaty of Versailles between Conventions and Recommendations was proposed by Mr. Gompers&apos; Commission on International Labour Legislation primarily to meet &apos;the difficulties of ratification which certain members of the International Labour Organisation would experience on account of the limitations imposed on the central executive and legislative powers by the constitution of Certain Federal States, and notably of the United States themselves. Under the proposals of Mr. Gompers&apos; Commission, which were reproduced in Article 405 of the Treaty, the Government of a Federal State whose power to enter into Conventions on labour matters is subject to limitations may treat a Draft Convention to which such limitations apply as a recommendation only.The Commission felt, however, that the distinction between a Convention and a Recommendation might be useful for other purposes, e,g., where a&apos; subject came before a Conference &quot; which, owing to their complexity and the wide differences in the circumstance of different countries, will be incapable of being reduced to any universal and uniform mode of application.&quot; In such cases, the Commission thought &quot; a convention might prove impossible, but a recommendation of principles in more or less detail which left the individual States freedom to apply them in the manner best suited to their conditions would undoubtedly have considerable value.&apos;&apos;It should be noted, however, that for the adoption of a recommendation by a Conference a clear two-thirds majority of votes is necessary, as required in the case of a Convention.

This natural tendency was encouraged by the preliminary Conference which the International Seamen&apos;s Federation had held at Genoa for the purpose of determining a common policy and line of action.41. The voting of the shipowners was not organised to the same extent, although the shipowners held group meetings and acted together in the protection of their common interests. The existence in certain countries, e.g., France, of legislation limiting the hours of seamen, tended to make the employers of these countries vote for aConven-tion which, as might be presumed, would equally handicap their competitors.48. The voting of the Government was not organised at all, even the Government delegates of the different parts of the British Empire voting on occasion on different sides. Almost without exception, the Governments having no seaboard, or whose mari-time interests were unimportant, voted in accordance with the views of the seamen as e.g., in the case of the Hours Convention.43. The tendency, remarked by Mr. Barnes in his report on the Washington Conference, for the representatives of the South American States to constitute a bloc and vote without much sense of responsibility was also manifest at Genoa.44. The voting at the Conference should do much to reconcile labour interests to a part of the constitution of the International Labour Organisation to which they had formerly objection, viz., the &quot; double representation &quot; of the Government. The reasoning in favour of the present arrangement set out in the report of Mr. Gompers&apos; Commission has been shown to be well-founded. The view was there expressed that &quot; It was likely, especially in the future, that the Government delegates would vote more often with the workers than against them. If this were so, it was obviously to the advantage of the latter that the Governments should have two votes instead of one, as it would render it easier for them to obtain a two-thirds majority, which under the France-American proposal (i.e., of equal representation) would be practically impossible if the employers voted in a body against them.&quot;45. An examination of the voting list will show how greatly Government delegates contributed to the 48 votes which were cast in favour of the Hours Convention at Genoa; and on other occasions the seamen&apos;s proposals were carried by the duplicate Government votes.46. Although the Convention on the most important item on the Agenda of the Conference was riot adopted, it would be a mistake to say that the Conference was a failure. The shipowners have undoubtedly realised&quot; that improved conditions of employment must be introduced ; and in fact they submitted concrete proposals which, &apos; although less favourable than those which were put forward by the British Government delegates, were in advance of those generally in force in the great mercantile marines of the world. The acceptance by the shipowners of the 3-watch system for deck hands is of itself a great advance. &apos; The fear of public opinion, if no ,other motive, should prevent the shipowners from going back on their terms when the moment comes for reopening negotiations. On the other hand, the disillusionment &apos;which will follow on Genoa, when the significance of falling freights and cancelled shipbuilding contracts is brought home to the seamen, should do much to show British seamen that, while the 8-hour day and 48-hour week of the Peace Treaty is a standard to be aimed at, where it has not already been attained to quote the language of the Treaty of Versailles  the time has not yet come for the rigid application of that rule of limitation.47. The seamen did gain certain positive advantages at the Conference, as, for example, the adoption of Conventions abolishing the &quot; crimp,&quot; establishing facilities for finding employment for seamen and providing for the payment of an unemployment indemnity in the case of the loss or foundering of a ship. A minimum age (14) was also agreed upon for the admission of children to employment on board ship.48. The Recommendations limiting the hours of work in the fishing industry and in.
inland navigation, and in favour of a careful examination of the question of insuring seamen against unemployment, are all movements in the right direction.49. This is not the place to consider the result of divergent views of Govern-ment delegates from the various parts of the Empire. But we must express some regret that the instructions and action of our colleagues of the India Office, in view of the fact that the Secretary of State for India is a member of the British Cabinet, were framed and carried out with so little reference to ourselves. At the outset of the proceedings, as mentioned in paragraph 22, our support was readily promised to our Indian colleagues in their efforts to protect the Indian maritime position. On the other hand, when the crisis of the Conference came we found that a private arrangement had been, made, without our being informed, between the Indian Delegation and the British seamen. In order to secure special terms for Lascars the whole of the Indian Delegation, except the seamen&apos;s representative, agreed to abstain from voting on the Hours Convention. The position taken up by the Cabinet and the British Government delegates was thereby jeopardised; had one vote less been cast against the Hours Convention&apos; the latter would have been adopted, and the British Government would then have been under an obligation to take further action in accordance with Article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles.50. We are strongly of opinion, as a result of our experiences at Genoa, that not only as regards the India Office, but as regards all Government Departments concerned, there should be closer co-operation in the work of preparation for future Conferences, and also generally in dealing with International Labour questions and the work of the International Labour Office. One Government Department, presumably the Ministry of Labour, should form the centre, should take the lead in calling into conference the other Departments concerned on questions of International Labour policy, and should have a proper secretarial branch responsible for correspondence.C.
