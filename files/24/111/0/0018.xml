At Kifri the Arabs entered the town and took the Assistant Political Officer prisoner. The Baghdad - Shergat line was cut between Balad and Istabulat, but repaired same day.   In the Hillali area rebels concentrated near railway blockhouse, but were dispersed.   One brigade carrying out punitive measures encountered insurgents near Hillah. Cavalry and Sikhs turned flank and rebels fled towards river.   In the Kirkuk area it is reported Tuzind is invested by rebels. Small columns reached Quaraghan with sli$it opposition.   The garrison has been repeatedly attacked without success.?\The Political Officer at Ah at r eh is being withdrawn to Nasiriyahby air if possible.   Air raids are being carried out where ne ce ssary.Sir Percy Cox, who was appointed High Commissioner of Mesopotamia some months ago, left London on 26th August.PALEST INS.The British Government have decided that there must be &apos;no question of setting up British Administration in TransJordania. All that is to be done at present is the despatch of four or five political officers to assist the Arab Administration, which will not be part of the Palestine Administration.The French have accepted the Sykes-Picot&quot;line east of Jordan as the boundary between Syria and TransJordan!a, until the question is settled in Europe, and no French interference will take place South of that line.P E R S I A.The advance of the Persian Government forces has been arrested, as gunboats are bombarding Enzeli to prevent Cossacks from entering town.   This seems to prove conclusively that the Russian Soviet Government, in spite of their repeated denials, are supporting, or at least acquiescing in the attack on Persia.F. I II L A N DA Ger-mn ship repatriating Russian Prisoiiers of War at BJorko, attempted to land a big gun.   The gun was sent back to Germany in the same ship.   The Finnish irfinister for Foreign Affairs states that this is another attempt to involve the Finnish Government in illicit arms traffic.It is considered that Finland vail sign peace with Soviet Russia -in the near future.   The Soviet Government are making uon-cessions, especially in the ratter of Petchenga, and they demand s-i-rlar clauses, for the exclusion of vessels of -war as in treatise with other Baltic States.   Finland states that this will not be accepted.s
FINLAND (contd.)

The British Military Attache, Helsingfors, reports on 27th August, that the Finnish-Russian armistice was signed at 8.0? p.m. on l3th August, 1920.

SOVIET RUSSIA.

General. The Polish offensive continues. In the northern Sector Soldau, Mlawa and Bialystock have been occupied, and the district to Prussian frontier is now being cleared of Bolsheviks; attempts by the latter to break through have failed. In the centre there has been no material change, but the capture of Brest-Litovsk is confirmed. In the South, Soviet troops on the Lemburg front are now retiring after suffering considerable losses. Budennie&apos;s cavalry is reported to have been severely handled, but is now moving North in the region of Stojanov and Raviechow, and he has been ordered to Krasnystan; this movement is probably intended to relieve pressure on troops retiring from Lemburg.

The Poles state that they have definite proof that the Bolsheviks have been receiving arms through Reval from Germany, as many rifles of 1920 Mauser pattern have been captured. The British Control Mission at Berlin, have been asked to comment on this statement.

The negotiations at Minsk are protracted due to bad communications. Recriminatory telegrams have passed between Tchitcherin and Sapieha, each accusing the other for delay.

BALTIC.

Lithuania. The Polish-Lithuanian question will most probably be reopened.

The Lithuanians decided to occupy Vilna on August 24th. A telegram was sent to Moscow pointing out that this was not a hostile act but a military necessity to prevent Lithuanian territory falling into Polish hands.

SOUTH RUSSlA.

Wrangel&apos;s offensive continues successfully. Troops have been landed in three places in the Kuban and Black Sea Provinces. The main objectives are Novorossisk, Sochi and the Ekaterinodar-Rostov railway. Local populations are giving full support to  the operations. Novorossisk, Ekaterinodar and Sochi have since been reported occupied by Wrangel&apos; s forces.

The Green Guards, formerly anti-Denikin, and now anti-Bolshevik due to the treatment meted out to their leaders by the Bolsheviks, will support Wrangel provided their independence is guaranteed. This has been done in the agreement with the Cossacks by which Wrangel is recognised as Supreme Commander of all anti-Bolshevik forces while Cossacks retain their independence.

Risings in the Bolshevik rear are reported in the Ekaterinoslav district and also to the North and West of Alexandrovsk, Red forces have been repulsed on whole front with heavy loss.
0 A II C A S I A.Azerbaijan,   A letter from one of the British Officers at Baku da^oa^^tTXiifTUst states that the British prisoners are still.in prison.    The Coiiiander-in-Chief has sent one consignment of articles needed by the prisoners and will send another as soon as -assurance of safe delivery of this consignment is received.   The total number of prisoners is 52*Caspian.   The Persian Cossacks under Starosselski reoccupied 6eshU on August 21st, but have since been driven out by  reinforced. Bolshevik forces, both naval and military. Captured papers including detailed plans for an advance on Teheran prove that the whole adventure was organised by the Soviet Republic of&apos; Azerbaijan.   The ships which bombarded the Cossacks belong to the same republic.Armenia.   The Ooraoander-in chief, reviewing the general situation, states that the yielding of Armenia to Soviet pressure has had a threefold effect.Armenia has now become a corridor instead of a buffer between the Bolshevik and Turkish ,Nationalists;, Armenia&apos;s existence as an independent State has become increasingly difficult; and Georgia1s position is unfavourably affected.A clear understanding was reached early in August between Ivies cow and laistapha Kemal concerning military assistance to be provided by the former for service in Anatolia against the principal common enemy GreatvBritain.     If events were such that, fro:L the Polish and South Russian fronts, Soviet troops could be released further to reinforce the Turks, then our interests in Mesopotamia, Persia and even in Constantinople would become, in face of the position of the Bolsheviks, a matter of grave concern.   It now seems that V/rangel will .save us from such a gloomy and perilous prospect Ivy military operations which strike at the root of the Soviet occupation of the Caucasus.Pamphlets in Turkish are being dropped from seaplanes at the principal ports along the North Anatolian coast by H.H.S. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;.     Arrangements are also being completed in order to stop the supply of war material to Mustapha Kemal by sea.G- B R m any the attitude of Germans towards the Allied officers on Control Commissions has undergone a change for the worse.The German Foreign Office have given assurances to the British Ambassador that they have not concluded an agreement with the Soviet Government.The strike, which affected 75fo of the miners in Upper Silesia is virtually over, and it is expected that work, will be resumed.fully on the 30th August.OZSOgO - SLOVAKIA.The For el-&apos;n Minister informed the British I&amp;nistar at Bucharest that-a defensive alliance had just been concluded between Czechc-Slovakia and Jugo-Slavia.   He now desires to include Rumania in the alliance.   Rumania will not join unless Greece also joins in..It would appear that the fear of Hunga?rian imperialism is uniting ail these States.
in   O   1*1DANZIG.The Allies have decided that Poland should have free use of the Port of Danzig in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, and instructions in this sense have been sent to Sir Reginald Tower, British High Commissioner.British and French men of war have received orders to render all possible support to the High Commissioner in carry-ing out the policy of Allied Powers regarding the unloading of munition ships for Poland,.The High Commissioner is strongly opposed to the introduction of Polish troops &quot;or unloading munitions.I,T A L YReferring&quot; to the arrival of a representative of Soviet. Russia in Rome, the Italian Minister Oor Foreign affairs said that the food question in Italy might assume alarming propor-tions next winter, and that he therefore wished to satisfy -public opinion that he is doing all he can to obtain grain from Russia.Reports continue to be received that D!Annunzi.o  : intends to proclaim the independence of FIIMS. including SU3HAK and BUOOARI on the 12th September.It is not known how far the Italian Government is irwclv-ed in this scheme, which has, however, the obvious advantage of detaching FUME from the general ADRIATIC problem.G- R Hi 3 0 E.Gen. Paraskevopoulos has returned to Smyrna and. established his H.Q. there a^ain.   As a result of. the recent operations his prestige is such that local Greek opinion would be rather insulted than gratified were he to be mentioned in the same breath with Napoleon or Foch.   Before these opera-tions Greece was the humble and admiring ally of Great Britain;P PLAN D.The Polish delegates have rejected all the 15 points put f forward by the Soviet deleTates.The Anglo-French Mission left Warsaw for Paris on the 25th August.In their opinion the battle is completely won, and there is no longer any menace to Warsaw, as the Poles have already captured  %rds of the Soviet guns.  j-  1The Poles are trying to occupy the old German line running through the Pinsk marshes.   This line Is a very strong one, and caii be held by a small force.   It is not expected that the army will atteirpt to go beyond it..The Polish Government points out that the Lithuanian Government disarmed and interned the Polish, troops that crossed the Lithuanian frontier, while&apos; 8 oviet troops seeking refuge in Lithuania now are merely disarmed and, allowed to return to Russia.   Sir H. Rmnbold urges that strong representations should be made to the Lithuanian Government against this un-neutral attitude.
(Oontd.)noxr she is the Great Power o-p the Near East, whose aid Great Britain and Pranoe invoked for&apos;work they were unwilling, or unable, to perfom for themselves.   As regards the future, the Greek intention is to ^orm an armed cordon round their zone, trenches being dug and guns&apos; mounted when necessary.A L B A N I A7ith reference to the agreement of 5th August &quot;between the Italian and Albanian Governments, it has been learned that Italy only proposes to maintain&apos;a small Naval post on the Island of Sasseno and that the lavish expenditure incurred at Valona will not be repeated.   A high power Y//T station will be established.JTJgO   SLAVIA..In Jugo Slav official circles the Albanian attacks are attributed to Italian intrigues and they are regarded as a manifestation of the evils resulting from the failure of the Powers to.settle the Adriatic question.It is reported that on the 20th August, Albanians attacked a Jugo Slav transport in the &quot;Kastrati Oanal and took her to Scutari.   The capture of Alessio by the Jugo-Slavs is contradicted.T U, RKE Y.The new High Commssiiner, ;Hr MAX MULLSR, will, on ratification of the Turkish Treaty, be rej-appointed as Minister.A R A B I ATithama.   The movements of IBN SAUD are pausing uneasiness at SANA and the.        is said to be entirely occupied in strengthening himself against a possible advance of IBN SAID towards SANA.PORTUGALAlmost an international question has arisen between Portugal and Brazil *   It a/pears that 2,500 Portuguese fisher^n emigrated to Brazil, but on arrival found that they could not carry out their trade unless they naturalised themselves Brazilians.   They were thus stranded and have had to choose betv^een naturalising themselves and going on fishing, or remain-ing Portugues citizens and taking up some other trade.SYRIA   AND   PALESTINE.Emir Feisal left Port Said on 23rd August for Naples where he arrived on 25th August. He is proceeding to Lucerne via lui lan.Northern Syria and Oilicia.     The French are continuing to improve their position in oillcia^ their recent successful operations against   Feisal are reported to have had a marked effect on the Kemalist troops &quot;against whom the French are reported to be obtaining successes in the neighbourhood of Adana.
sB EL O I U, M&quot;      &quot;&apos;,&apos;)&quot;&apos;U&quot;1.....i- iimn &quot;* ilA orisis occurred on 25 th August over the decision of the Cabinet to maintain their obstructive attitude as regards the transhipment ,via Antwerp of French munitions ef war for Poland.   The Minister for   Foreign Affairs has definitely resigned^   The Minister for War, who was desirous of resigning, has withdrawn his resignation and it is probable that the whole of the&apos;Cabinet will remain in office until at any rate the King returns from Brazil.
