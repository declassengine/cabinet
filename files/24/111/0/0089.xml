(P. 7178) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 33262M&apos; September 1920.(Received 12 noon.)Clear the line.1139 S.   Report has been received from usually trustworthy source that over-throw of Amir of Bokhara has caused intense excitement in Kabul, and that in consequence Afghan &quot;^delegation may be sent very shortly to India to attempt to conclude final agreement with. British Government.   Trend of Afghan arguments at * Mussoorie and, recent developments make it in our opinion exceedingly probable that, if delegation comes they will press either for defensive alliance with the British, or- at least for immediate and generous gifts to Afghanistan of arms and ammunition to give confidence to Afghan people and enable them resist Bolshevik pressure and demands for Afghan co-operation against the British in India (corrupt group).   We foresee that the Afghans may make our attitude in this matter the crucial test of our intentions towards them, and may declare in all sincerity that while they wish to be-&apos; our friends and to make agreement on lines suggested at Mussoorie, they are not strong enough to do so (? without) help indicated, and will fail in such (? help) be reluctantly forced to accept Bolshevik terms.   Djemal Pasha with large mixed dele--gation of Bolshevik (sic) and Turks has reached Herat on the way to (? Kabul) and if the Afghan delegation comes to India with requests foreshadowed (sic) above, it will be imperatively necessary to come to speedy decision.   We desire therefore to acquaint you with our views, and to obtain preliminary orders.   Regular defensive alliance with Afghanistan could hardly be considered since it would involve us in obligations which present circumstances would make it difficult to Carry out.Gifts of arms and ammunition to Afghanistan would, however, be on different footing. There is of course risk that they might in some future contingency be turned against us, but we believe that in dilemma in which Afghans now find themselves we&apos;v must show some trust in them, and that prompt gift of arms and ammunition would cause great revolution (? revulsion) of popular feeling in Afghanistan in our favour, and would have good effect on Indian Moslem sentiment. We should be able to spare considerable numberv of rifles and machine guns with ammunition, and should presumably have to send up instructors for machine guns. We would of course insist in return on immediate signature of treaty of friendship on lines already laid down on sincere co-operation between Afghans and ourselves on Indian frontier, and on continuous friendly interchange of views on joint policy (? for) so long as the Bolshevik menace to Afghanistan may subject.. We do not think it would be wise to stipulate formally for expulsion of all Bolshevik agents. This would probably follow automatically on resistance of Afghanistan to Bolshevik pressure. We should be glad to receive very early indication of your views on foregoing suggestions.
