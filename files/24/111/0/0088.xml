There was great depression after the conference with &apos; the Prime Minister 3ast night.   The real position is that while the Miners of tha Midlands and North are prepared to call off the strike, the South Wales delegates dare not consent, knowing that their men are out of hand.   Hard words were used against tho Transport Workers for their refusal to come out in sympathy with the Miners.Tha Road Transport Workers have tendered notices to expire nest week.Special attention is called in this report to the growta of revolutionary feeling and the harm done by subsidies from Russia.  Unemployment is increasing rapidly and the temper of ex-Service men, especially in London, is ugly; they may prove a very serious menace during the winter months; they are already a prey to agitators. *Details are given of the effect of the exposure of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   The paper itself has lost some of Its venom and seems to be discredited among the steadier workers.   The Business Manager anticipates a falling-off in the circulation and is very anxious.In Ireland serious outrages have been less, owing probably to the fear of reprisals, buts the reprisals themselves are creating an unfavourable impression in England.
THE THRB/.TBM2D COAL strike the conference of the Triple Alliance broke off this morning and will be resumed this evening.   The interval&apos; will be spent in sectional discussions among the Miners. There was a great feeling of depression after the conference with the Prime Minister.   The position appears to be that the South Wales leaders dare not go back to their men without some concession, while other sections of the Miners are inclined to call off the strike.   Apparently the rank and file in South Wales is quite out of hand and the leaders know it.   Hard words were used against the Transport Workers for their refusal to come out in sympathy with the Miners.Reports from the various coalfields indicate little change in the general feeling.   It is a curious fact that, although the miners were generally indifferent to the demand for a reduction in the price of coal, they are now complaining that the Bxecutive had no right to depart from the mandate given by the ballot for the dual claim. South wales the demand for an increase of wages is universal.   There-is much talk of revolution resulting from a strike and in many districts there will almost certainly be looting.There have been stormy meetings on the abandonment of the dual claim and in the Western Valleys and Khondda Do. 1 districts resolutions &quot;emphatically protesting&quot; against the action of the Miners&apos; Federation have been carried.   The colliery examiners are expected to continue at work, avoiding anything in the nature of &quot;blackleg&quot; labour.   The miners&apos; wives support their husbands without understanding what it all means.In South.Wales most of the Railwaymen&apos;s branches have decided to support the miners, but the Mid Rhondda Branch&quot; has rescinded its previous resolution of support on the excuse of the change in the miners&apos; demands. . The Eewport Branch cf theSailors&apos;/
4Sailors&apos; and Firemen^ Union will support the Triple Alliance in whatever steps may be decided upon. Lancashire and CheshireOn September 18th the change in the miners&apos; claims was agreed to but it was resolved that any Government offor shoulj-be submitted to the men before acceptance.   The miners here a:i determined to secure the increase in wages but they are against Mr. Smillie, whose tactics they condemn.   They go so far as to say that he ought to be thrown down the pit.   In places such as Leigh, Westhoughton and Wigan, coal is close  j to the surface and if a strike occurs it is intended to work these seams for the benefit of the miners&apos; families and theiil friends.   Here, the majority of the railwaymen and dockers would not support the miners but it is thought that a strike would be accompanied with violence. YorkshireThere is great confusion in this area.   The railwaymen are apathetic and a sympathetio strike would not be general. Northumberland and DurhamThe position is unchanged.   Sections of the railwaymen intend to support the miners. Tho MidlandsThere is much disappointment at the failure of negotiati A strike is not wanted and the miners are surprised that theit threats did not secure concessions.   Special meetings have M hastily summoned and if the real feeling of the miners is correctly reported to their leaders it would tend towards moderate demands.   The local colliery managers and officials are convinced that any addition to wages will bring increased absenteeism and a reduction of output unless payment by resull is introduced.Three Iron Works in Derby have notified their employees, numbering about 1,700, that they will cease work if the mine!&apos;strike/
strike. SootlandThe alteration in the miners&apos; olaims has resulted in increased support for the Federation.   All are resolved on the wages question and delegates have been instructed to support ttye Executive.   Sinoe many of the miners are Sinn Feiners or Bolshevists there is considerable support for the proposal that the mines  should be seized.   In the Hamilton, Burnbank, Stonefield and Blantyre districts the extremist, McDougall, is trying to form a Red Army.   It is doubtful whether the Railwaymen will support the miners, &quot;whom they regard as better paid than themselves.THB GROWTH OF REVOLUTIONARY jgMgIt does not appear to be realised either by the Press or the&apos; public how rapidly revolutionary feeling has been growing in all parts of the country among the younger workmen.   The subsidy which has been offered and partly used by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; represents only one section of the money spent on Bolshevik propaganda in this country.   It is now possible to form an estimate of the ramifications of Russian intrigue. There is probably no extremist organisation in England which has not received financial assistance from Russia.According to her own statement. Sylvia Pankhurst has received: 260 from Z&amp;chariassen Money direct from Litvinoff Several sums from Scandinavia Three quids of money from a Swedish courier, one of which was used for the &quot;Workers&apos; . Dreadnought&quot; and one for the Young Socialist League, and 8,000 kronen for the Agenda Press.She returned from Russia on Monday last, bringing with her asum of money and she is expecting a further sum of  3,000.In addition to these amounts. Theodore Rothstein paid hera monthly subsidy of  40 for the People1s Russian InformationBureau and Rothstein also paid for the printing and posting of
her ComwuniBt manifestoes and for the labels which were affixed to shops and houses.   As usually happens in such oases, they fell out.   The other Societies were jealous of the money she was receiving and she was not satisfied with the amount.The Bolshevik agent who arranges for couriers and stowaways is now appointing special agents at salaries varying from  6 to  10 a week to cover districts and infiltrate the Trade Unions with Red propaganda.   A start has already been* &apos;made with the dockers. This is in accordance with the programme outlined by J. T, Murphy at the Amsterdam meeting, .There is reason to believe th&amp;.t several officials of the Communist Party are in Bolshevik pay; it is known that Albert Inkpin has for months been receiving a weekly salary.   In December, 1919, it was reported that Willis, Poet, Coates,and Ramsey were in receipt of a weekly stipend from Rothstein.   In January, 1980, Ihkpin is believed to have received  500 from Rothstein, which was used to defray the cost of the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; demonstration at the Albert Hall.   The deficit in &quot;The Call&quot; was guaranteed by. Rothstein and the paper received a weeklj subsidy of  25.   In May, 1920, Rothstein was reported to have given  200 to the Walthamstow Branch of the British Socialist Party.Tho Socialist Labour Party is believed to have received a sum of nearly  300 in 1919 and there is little doubt that the Clyde Workers1 Committee and the Socialist Information and Research Bureau have also been subsidised. ,In Hay, 1919, &quot;The Worker&quot; asked the Executive, of the Third International for a bub of  1,000 and though it was oontinually appealing to readers for money it was able, on August 31at last, to distribute 300,000 gratuitous copies.   The Socialist Information and Research Bureauwhich,/
5572which, in March, 1920, was receiving a weekly subsidy of  20 from Rothstein, also distributed gratis 200,000 pamphlets in Lanarkshire on September 6th, while orders were given for the distribution of 300,000 copies of the &quot;Forward&quot; at a Glasgow football match on September 11th.   The weekly gratis distribution of extremist literature in the Glasgew area has been about 1,000,000 copies for some time.The extent to which the Workers&apos; Committees have been subsidised is not known, but in view of the importance attached to this movement by Lenin it has probably been considerable. It is known that the cost of the Rank and Pile Convention was borne toy Rothstein, and the long stay in Russia of Tanner, tho Editor of &quot;Solidarity&quot;, has certainly not been at his own expense.- It is probable that the Left Wing of the Independent Labour Party has received monetary assistance, and Mr. and Mrs. Walton Ilewbold, at least, were at one time in receipt of a weekly salary of  7. 10s. Od. from Rothstein.   Lenin was at that time trying to effect the disruption of the Independent Labour Party by encouragement of the Left Wing.The &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee was known to have been subsidised by Nogin.On August 83rd Rosowski, when passing through Stockholm on his way to Reval, informed Litvinoff that the Krassin Delegation had distributed enormous sums of money for revolutionary propaganda in England.-      * .iAltogether, it is estimated that at least  100,000 of Russian money has been spent in revolutionary propaganda in England during the last nine months.   Reports from the Midlands show that working men lecturere, who are certainly not homy-handed,, are frequenting public houses and delivering impromptu expositions on the benefits of Soviet Government.   In South Walesmany/&apos;
*M    Q    a*many people regard the strike merely as a step towards Bolshevik revolution, and the feeling among the less instructed men appears to bo general that Parliament has outlived its usefulness.   Probably something could have been done to stem the tide if the receipt of money for revolutionary purposes from foreign countries had, as in other countries, been made a criminal offence.&quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;Second in importanoe to the threatened strike is the recent exposure of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and the weakness of tho defonce put up by Mr. Lansbury and his co-Directors.   The ordinary raiddle^olasa public are asking why the Government does not prevent publication and what they are doing to allow the Bolshevik Government to stir up trouble in Sngland.....   Pains have been.taken to ascertain the feeling among working men.(l) Trade Unionists think that the paper should not be run on foreign money.   This opinion is due probably to an innate sense of honesty, but even more to the sub-oonsoious dislike of the average worker for anything foreign.(2) The &quot;Intelligentsia&quot; of the Labour movement thinkthat the power of the paper is broken.   They do not object so much to the acceptance of the money as to the result of the exposure.(3). The failure of the &quot;Herald&quot; to clear itself isstated to have had a disastrous effect on sales,   Harford the business manager, is very anxious and anticipates a marked falling off in circulation.(4) The extremists are annoyed with the &quot;Herald&quot; forthe clumsy way in which it dealt with the accusation. They think that Lansbury should have told the truth andshamed/
m   7   -Shame the devil. (5) &apos;       Other extremists are indifferent.   They look upon  &apos; &quot; &apos;     &apos; i &apos; - &apos;. 1* 4 &apos;the disclosure as part of the fight with Capitalism and declare their unalterable faith in Lansbury.   They think, however, that &quot;Meynell was a fool, especially in accepting bank notes for  1,000, that go from bank to bank, followed, as it were, by two Policemen.&quot;(6) My correspondents have met no one who believesthe story that Lansbury did not know of the transaction.(7) Among the staff there were moments of panic   Lastweek a rumour was started in Fleet Street that Meynell was &quot;wanted for high treason&quot; and he fled through the country in a motor-car &quot;like a hunted man&quot;.   It required a member of the Editorial staff to reassure him. -iB\ The most important result of the exposure is thatthe National Union of Railwaymen will not now invest the sum of  20,000 as was intended, and it is not unlikely that this example will be followed by other Unions.(?) In Fleet Street the belief appears to be general that the &quot;Daifcy Herald&quot; must close down, at any rate as a daily paper, now that it oan no longer draw upon the. inexhaustible resources of Bolshevik Russia.It now appears that the diamonds brought by Kemeneff were disposed of by Mrs. Classman, the mother-in-law of Edgar Lajtisbury, and that they were actually displayed in Edgar Lansbury1s house.   As George Lansbury breakfasts with his son every morning it is inconclivable that he was ignorant of the transaction.There is good reason for believing that part of the  75,000 has been already spent and that some of it was used for Meynell1s expenses on the Continent.   There is much speculation about how the remainder is to be disposed of.Members/
Members of the Coventry branch of the Communist Party are already watering at the mouth, having received an intimation from London headquarters that the money may become available for them and that another extremist dally may be started.Although the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has suffered a serious blow it must be remembered that it fills a need.   Its industrial news, apart from propaganda items, has been moro or less correct and the workers prize it on this account.In tho &quot;Forward&quot; of the 18th September, there is astrong criticism of Ilr. George Lansbury:&quot;He should tell the whole story of how he was kept in the dark and permitted to make statements which now require serious qualification, even if the tolling of the story means public censure and dismissal of other members oi the staff of the &quot;Daily Herald&apos;&quot;.. The &quot;Forward&quot; has put its finger on the weak spot.If Mr. George Lansbury told the whole truth he would bofinally discredited and if he tells further untruths heknovfs be will be found out.-    It is worth mentioning that Lir. Ilalone,        , istrying to get a few branches to send in resolutions,finding fault with tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; for not accepting \the subsidy.TH2 LABOUR PARTY AMD TEJi) COIMJHI3T PARTY ITbe London Labour Party is reported to have based it /  decision to refuse affiliation with l5ho London branch of the Communist Party on a passage In an article by Arthur Mcllanus, which indicates an intention to &quot;sabotage&quot; the Labour Party froa within.   This has always been the dream of Lenin. IB3/ I
TELE) SOUTH V7/XBS AHD gggT 0! ENGLAND CQMMUI3 1ST PARTYAnother Communist Party was formed last week under the above title.   It will probably work in conjunction with Hiss Sylvia Pankhursfs group.   A circular waa sent out to all the extremist bodies, proclaiming the objects to be the overthrow of Capitalism and. tfce establishment of Communism, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, Soviets, affiliation to the Third International and refusal to engage in Parliamentary action.   It will probably become of some local importance.   During a conversation after the meeting A./. Cook, onS of the promoters, said that the rank and file of South Wales would fight ovon if their leaders &quot;sell tho coal strike&quot;. Ho added that Lenin thinks there will be a revolution in England during the next six months.   D. A. Davis, of Porth, said that 70 per cent of South Wales are ready for Communism when organised in one big Party.THg COUNCIL OP ACTICfl&apos;Although LIT. Gorman Angell states in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; that tho &quot;national Council of Action is already reduced to impotence&quot; and &quot;does nothing&quot;, largely because &quot;the movement towards a coal strike has drawn its teeth&quot;, ho such reproach oan be made against the local Councils. At Herthyr and Cardiff the local Councils aro almost frankly Soviets and ready for revolution of even the most sanguinary kind.   I alluded in ray last report to other looal Councils with the same programme.IJmCTO .U.0BG Bg-SERVI0&apos;i3 ggjj &apos;There is growing unrest among ex-Service men in the London area, and unemployment is malting them reckless and dangerous/
dangerous.   The International and the National Unions arechief 1,7 responsible; the men march to tiieir meetings and the speeches are violent.   It is not necessary here to give thornin detail, but such phrases as occurred in the speech ofRobert Jones in Hyde Park on September 20th are typical:&quot;We are out for tho abolition of the present rotten system of society and the establishment of a system of society based on Communistic principles, by a social revolution ...... We realise that we are not strong enough to march to the House of Commons; if we were, by God, we would march there and we would drive those seven hundred Uomjers of Parliament into the streets to play a barrel organ thore.   We would starve them as they have starved us.&quot;At the same meeting George Turner Baid:&quot;Comrades, I am classed as a Bolshevik and a menace to Civilisation.   I am oroud to be a menace to Civilisation as I see it to be&quot;.The sinister feature is that some of these men are carrying arms, that they look upOw themselves as the &quot;Red Armyand ire so regarded by the other extremists.   A crowd ofunemployed, principally ex-Service men, invaded NorwichGuildhall during a mooting of the City Council on September 1st, but, beyond commenting on tho debate, they wore notdisorderly.   In Leicester the extremists are gaining a holdover the unemployed e;:-Service man, who have, more than oncemarched through the torn in Military formation and are regarded as a section of the Red Army.TR3 Ot^OPBRAT-IYB UPV-SiiaaTOn September 15th tho Special jtaergency National Co-operative Conference at Preston decided not to instruct local societies to take unconstitutional action, in tho shane of passive resistance to the Corporation Profits Tax. Tho &quot;Stratford&quot; amendment, advocating passive resistance, was defeated by 1,912 votes to 1,055.   The main resolution pledged the societies &quot;to use all legitimate ^eans to defeat
the working of the Corporation Profits Ttx insofar as it taxes the surplusoo arising from mutual trading of co-operative societies.&quot;It is interesting to note that the Sdmonton and Stratford Co-operative Societies^ to whose connection with the local Council of. motion I referred in my report No. 71, has now acquired a fleot of Chars-a-bancs.   Tho society has a farm of 645 acres at Ongar, from which 50,0&apos;^J gallons of milk are distributed weekly.&quot;no R3HT&quot; campaignMy correspondent reports that small Debt Courts in Scotland are gradually becoming overtaxed with business in connection with disputes botjwoen landlords and tenants over inoreasos in rent.   In Lanarkshire miners are the principal offenders, &quot;largo numbers have refused to pay incroased rent and decline to lo&amp;ve their houses.The hearing of the case against Councillor 3. Shinwoll asking eviction was deferred till 21st September, when it was decided to 63nd the dispute to the Ordinary Roll for dooision. A demonstration was held on Glasgow Green on Se^toraber 19th to support Shinwell end to obtain financial assistance to defray coat of paying for legal advice to members of the Labour Rousing Association, who. are becoming involved in litigation. It is understood that if an order is granted by the Court for Shinwel^s eviction, a guard or picket of ex^Service men will be detailed for duty at his residence to frustrate any attempt at eviction.Rent cards bearing the words &quot;We are not removing and we say no increase&quot; are thickly&apos;plastered over Lanarkshire, especially at Stonefield, Blantyre and Burnbank.   In a block of six houses at Burobenk five had the rent card in the windows.AMERICAN/
mm   J^JJ   **AMERICAN SINN FEIN PROPAGANDA AMONG BRITISH SEAMENThe American Sinn Feiner appears to have something to learn about the art of propaganda.   The following is a leaflet which is being distributed to British seamen In New York:LONGSHOREMEN I MARINE FIREMBRIOILERS    AND    WATERTENDERSl .    OF THE ATLANTIC COAST AND VICINITY.ENGLAND the common enemy is dirtyi HER SOLDIERY and POLICE are shooting down Irish Workers,and burning Irish towns.

They know what they are about.   They know what seamen want.   Are you going to scab?SEAMEN ARB BROTHERS THE WORLD OVER AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL!   . *    SO STAND CLEAR! LET THERE BE NO SCABS! THIS MANS YOU! NOW&apos; S YOUR CHANGS!   UP AMERICA!   UP IRELAND!   DOWN BRITISHTYRANNY. -SINN jjBIH IN GREAT BRITAIN -The usual Sinn Fein meetings have been held in London during the week and have been occupied with the status of the Ulster Volunteers.   Public interest in the fate of the Lord Mayor of Cork has greatly declined and Arthur Griffith admitted to a French newspaper correspondent who complained to him that ni]    he had been kicking his heels in Cork to take pictures of the outbreak that would follow on the Lord -Mayor1s death, that, regarded as propaganda, he regretted to say that the Lord Mayor of Cork was a failure; he should have died at least two weeks ago. ^ ,.In the Manchester distriot my correspondent thinks that the speakers of the Irish Self-Determination League are self-appointed and are secretly determined to keep on the right side cf the law owing to their lack of. courage.   They are doing their best to enrol members, but 75 per cent of the audience are usually women.   The firm attitude of the Government in the case of Alderman MaoSwiney has had a depressing effect upon these men, for they were counting on a victory over the Government.   For the peat few weeks no Sunday demonstrations have been held at Bolton because the opposing factions have been present to break them up.ien
In Glasgow it is reported that the continual influx of young Irishmen is producing lawlessness. Faotlon fights of Irish partisans occur daily and prosecutions merely result in fresh fights. Shopkeepers are intimidated into contribufi towards the payment of the fines of the convicted men, and ti money so collected is spent on drink. It is from this matmi that MacDougall is reoruiting his &quot;Red Army&quot;. Among these a many men of &quot;Red&quot; tendencies, and this is causing anxiety toSIthe better class of Sinn Feiners.Sinn Feiners made a secret survey of several territorial headquarters in Glasgow during the night of September 20th-2&apos; probably for the purpose of arranging preliminaries for making concerted raids for arms on the death of the Lord Mayor of CIRELANDThere was no material change in the condition of affain in the provinces but the week was not quite so successful fi a Sinn Fein point of view and the extremist section received few sharp checks.A new form of Sinn Fein propaganda is the sending of alleged typewritten extracts from private letters with blood curdling accounts of reprisals by the Police and Military. These are being widely circulated through the post and are causing a rather strong reaction among educated people in England.Of the 316 outrages reported, 274 crimes were directly attributable to Sinn Fein, only 4-were agrarian and 38 were serious offences arising indirectly from the disordered statu -of the country.   The number of outrages attributed directly Sinn Fein shows a decrease of 88 from the previous week while there is an increase in the other serious offences.-     9/
9 vacated Royal Irish Constabulary barracks, 5 court-houses and 2 coastguard stations wero burned, but a very large portion of the Sinn Fein outrages consisted of raids for arras, which totalled 109.   There were 42 cases of robbery, most of Jrhese being oases of holding up and robbing mail trains, cars and postmen to obtain official&quot; correspondence and money.4 persons, including 1 policeman, were kidnapped.Scariff Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks, Co. Clare, was attacked by 150 armed men, carrying rifles, shot guns, revolvers and bombs.   Two policemen received bullet wounds and some of the attacking party were apparently wounded.A number of Volunteer leaders have been captured as well as a quantity of their documents and correspondence.JThe chief efforts of Sinn Fein were still concentrated on the attempt to break up the Royal Irish Constabulary and boycott-ing notices signed by local officers of the Irish Republican Army, threatening letters end acts of intimidation towards the parents and families of members of the foroe were very prevalent.There was no important industrial unrest but all parties are closely watching the situation in England and any serious development there will be seized upon by the extremists here and is bound to re-act in this country.
