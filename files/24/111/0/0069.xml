SECRET.MESOPOTAMIA JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.eport on the Administration of Justice for the year 1919.To the Officiating Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. I.-Scope of Eeport.1. I have the honour to submit this Report on the Administration of Justice in the Occupied Territories of Mesopotamia for the year 1919.The Report which I submitted, shortly after my arrival at Baghdad, on the Administration of Justice in the -Baghdad Wilayat in the year 1917, described in some detail the organisation of the Courts and the system of justice under Turkish rule, and explained the policy which it was proposed to follow in re-establishing Courts of Justice in the Baghdad Wilayat.The policy was to carry on, in general, the Turkish organisation of the Courts and the Turkish Law, making such modifications only as were necessary to ensure justice and a reasonably efficient administration.My report for the year 1918 described the measures which had been taken in the course of the year towards carrying out this policy both as regards the Civil Courts, Criminal Courts, and Religious Courts, and referred to the decision that from the 1st January 1919 the system of justice in force in the Baghdad Wilayat should be extended to Basrah.The Courts of the Mosul Wilayat, which was occupied by His Majesty&apos;s Forces in October 1918, also came under the same system in January 1919.It will be fitting, therefore, that the present Report, which is the first Judicial Report to deal with the whole of the occupied territories, shall contain some account of the organisation of the Courts as they now exist and of the law administered by them, as well, as the usual account of their work and statistics.II.-Organisation of the Courts and the Law applied by them.A. Civil Courts.Grades of Civil Courts. The Civil Courts, which replace the civil and commercial jurisdiction of the Turkish Nazamiyah Courts, have general jurisdiction, except in cases which are within the jurisdiction of the Religious Courts. They are of three grades: (a) The Baghdad Court of Appeal; (6) Courts of First Instance; (c) Peace Courts.Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, which sits at Baghdad, is the Supreme Court of Appeal for the whole of the occupied territories. It replaces the three Turkish Courts of Appeal for the Baghdad Wilayat, the Basrah Wilayat and the Mosul Wilayat. But whereas the decisions of those Courts were subject to revision by the Court of Cassation at Constantinople, the decisions of the present Court of Appeal are final.The Court of Appeal is at present composed of a British President and two Arab Judges. The Turkish Court of Appeal was normally composed of a Turkish President and four Arab Judges. The present Arab Judges of the Court of Appeal receive a salary of Rs. 1,000 a month. The President of the Turkish Courts of Appeal received  T. 35 a month, and an ordinary member of the Court of Appeal  T. 15 a month.An appeal lies from every judgment of a Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeal. . .According to the Turkish system,, judgments of Peace Judges were not liable to appeal, but were liable to revision, or, to speak more correctly, to be set aside/by the Constantinople Court of Cassation. Now applications for revision from judgments of 2257     100 -9.20 A
Peace Courts lie to the Baghdad Court of Appeal, which, in addition to the powers possessed by the Turkish Court of Cassation of setting aside the judgment and ordering a new trial, can, if it lias the necessary facts before it, give a final judgment in the case.4. Courts of First Instance.--Under the Turks there was a Court of First Instance at the headquarters of each Liwah and of each Qadfca. At the headquarters of Liwahs and in the more important Qadhas, the Court consisted of a President, who received a salary of  T. 16 a month, and of two members, who received  T. .10 a month. At Baghdad the Court comprised a Civil Chamber and a Commercial Chamber. In less important Qadhas, the Qadhi of the Shar&apos;ah Court was President, and the two members were local inhabitants without legal training, who received a small allowance. In the wilayats of Baghdad, Basrah, and Mosul there were altogether 10 Liwah. Courts of First Instance and 40 Qadlia Courts of First Instance. It is obvious that there were far too many Courts, and that, having regard to the salaries paid, the majority of these Courts were incompetent.These Courts have been replaced by the following Courts : (i) Court of First Instance, Baghdad, consisting of a British President, an Arab Vice-President, and four members. The Court sits in two Chambers, one presided over by the British President and one by the Arab Vice-President.(ii) Court of First Instance, Hillah, consisting of a British President, an Arab Judge, and of the Qadhi of the Sunni or Shi&apos;ah Shar&apos;a Court.The President goes on circuit and holds Courts also at Najaf and Karbala.(iii) Court of First Instance, Ba&apos;qu.bah, consisting of a British President, an Arab Judge, and the Qadhi of the Sunni Shar&apos;ah Court.The President also holds Courts at Khaniqin and Mandali.(ivj Court of First Instance, Basrah, consisting of a British President and two Arab Judges.(v) Court of First Instance, Mosul, consisting of a British President and two Arab Judges.The President also holds Courts at Arbil.The Arab Vice-President of the Baghdad Court receives a salary of Rs. 800 a month, and most of the Judges of Courts of First Instance receive a salary of Rs. 525 a month. Having regard to the high cost of living, it will be necessary in due course to increase the salaries of the latter.If the number of Courts of First Instance under the Turks was excessive, the present number is insufficient and must be increased as suitable staff becomes available.5. Peace Courts. These Courts on their civil side were Small Cause Courts having jurisdiction to hear cases up to  T. 50. They had been established a short time before the outbreak of the war, and existed as separate Courts only in two or three places in Mesopotamia.Since the occupation, Peace Courts have been established at Baghdad, Mosul, Basrah, -Amarah, and Kirkuk. Elsewhere Judges of Courts of First Instance and Qadhis officiate as Peace Judges in addition to their other duties, and in places where there are no other Courts, Political Officers, Assistant Political Officers and other Government officials also officiate as Peace Judges with varying powers.6. Law Administered by the Civil Courts. As already stated, the Courts follow in general Turkish Law.The procedure of the Civil Courts is governed by the Code of Civil Procedure and subsequent amending laws. The Code is based on the French Code of Civil. Procedure.The substantive civil law consists of (1) The Majelleh or Ottoman Civil Code; (2) the Commercial Code; (3) the Marine Commercial Code; (4) the body of Ottoman Legislation; C5) proclamations issued by the General Officer Commanding.The Majelleh is a code published in the year 1869 of Hanaii Mohammedan Law. Being based on the Shar&apos;ah, it is regarded with much, respect in Mesopotamia, but it is not a satisfactory code by which to regulate modern transactions.The Code of Commerce is a translation, with some omissions, of the articles of the French Code of Commerce relating to partnerships, companies, bills of exchange, and bankruptcies.The Marine Commercial Code is principally based on French law.
B. Religious Courts.7. Sunni Mohammedan Law Courts. As I described in my annual report for 1917 the functions and organisation of the Mohammedan Law Courts (Mehakim Shariyeh) in the Baghdad Wilayet before the occupation, it will be sufficient1 to state that these Courts had jurisdiction in matters relating to personal status, such as marriage, divorce, guardianship, wills and succession, and Mohammedan charitable endowments; (Awqaf) that the law administered by these Courts was that of the Hanali sect of Mohammedan Sunni law; that a Mohammedan Law Court presided over by a Qadhi was established in every Qadha, and that an appeal from the judgments of the Qadhis lay to the Shar&apos;ah Court of Revision at Constantinople.As the Shi&apos;ah population of Mesopotamia outnumbers the Sunni, it was a hard-ship that Shi&apos;ahs were obliged to take their cases to Sunni Judges and to have them settled according to Sunni law. To remove this grievance, instructions have been issued to the Sunni Mohammedan Law Courts limiting their jurisdiction to cases arising between Simnis, and Sunni Mohammedan Law Courts have been re-established only in districts where there is a Sunni population.Some 30 Sunni Mohammedan Law Courts have been appointed in the occupied territories since the occupation.   A list of them will be found in Appendix III.A Court of Revision (Mejlis el Tamyiz), consisting of three Sunni Judges, has been established at Baghdad to deal with appeals from the judgments of the Sunni Mohammedan Law Courts.8. SliVah Mohammedan Law Courts. .In places where there has been a demand for them, Shi&apos;ah Judges (Naib el Jaafariyeh) have been appointed, having jurisdiction in cases relating to personal status arising between Shi&apos;ahs. A list of such Shi&apos;ah Courts is set out in Appendix V.The establishment of a Shi&apos;ah Court of Appeal, though desirable from a judicial point of view, would give rise to considerable difficulties, and the time is not yet ripe for such an innovation.9. Christian and Jewish Ecclesiastical Courts. Under the Turks the Christian and Jewish Ottoman communities, which were officially recognised by the Govern-ment, had Ecclesiastical Courts with a limited jurisdiction in matters of marriage, legitimacy and family relations. These Courts continue to exercise their former jurisdiction.C-Criminal Courts.10. Organisation and Powers of Criminal Courts. The Criminal Courts, which are now in existence, are regulated by the Baghdad Criminal Procedure Regulations and apply the Baghdad Penal Code. In my last annual report I explained the reasons which had necessitated, the substitution of these regulations and this code for the Ottoman Code of Criminal Procedure and the Ottoman Penal Code, and explained some of their chief features.The Baghdad Criminal Procedure Regulations is derived through the Sudan Criminal Procedure Code from the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, but adopts certain provisions from the Ottoman Criminal Procedure Code, the ultimate source of which is the French Code of Civil Procedure.The Baghdad Penal Code is based on the Ottoman Penal Code, which is itself based on the French Penal Code, but has been largely amended and rearranged, most of the amendments being taken from Egyptian sources.Four classes of Criminal Courts are constituted by the Baghdad Criminal Procedure Regulations: (1) Courts of Session, which may award any punishment authorised by law.(2) Courts of Magistrates of the first class, which may award a sentence notexceeding two years&apos; penal servitude or imprisonment. (3) Courts of Magistrates of the second class, which may award a sentence notexceeding six months&apos; imprisonment. (4) Courts of Magistrates of the third class, which may award a sentence notexceeding one month&apos;s imprisonment.Political&apos;Officers and British Judges are Magistrates of the first class. Assistant Political Officers and Arab Judges are Magistrates of the second class. The Civil Commissioner may appoint any person a Magistrate of the first, second or third class.
A Court of Session is a Court consisting of three Magistrates, of whom one at least must be a Magistrate of the first class. In places where a Civil Court is established, it ordinarily consists of the same members as compose the Civil Court, that is to say, a British Judge and two Arab Judges.Findings and sentences of Sessions Courts require confirmation by the Civil Commissioner. Findings and sentences of Magistrates do not require confirmation; but, if the sentence exceeds that which a Magistrate can pass summarily, an appeal lies against it, either to the Political Officer or the Civil Commissioner.In addition to the powers vested in them as regards cases which are brought before them by way of appeal, Political Officers and the Civil Commissioner have powers of revision. A Political Officer may call for and revise the judgment of any Magistrate subordinate to him, while the Civil Commissioner may call for and revise the judgment of any Criminal Court.In the exercise of his functions of confirming, appellant and revising authority, the Civil Commissioner is assisted by the Judicial Secretary, who performs similar duties to that of a Judge Advocate-General.Ill-Work of Courts in 1919.11. Civil Court of Appeal. Statistics of the work of the Court of Appeal are contained in Appendix I. In 1918 the Court heard 22 original appeals and 71 cases referred to it on revision. For the first six months of 1919 the corresponding figures are 59 and 61. For the final six months 95 and 122. The increase is not, I think, due to any growing, love of litigation, but arises solely from the re-establishment of Courts of First Instance and Peace Courts.During 1918 the Court of Appeal was formed of members of either of the Court of First Instance at Baghdad under the presidency of the Judicial Secretary. The first change in establishing a separate Court of Appeal took place on the appointment of Lieut.-Col. S. C Knox as President on 17th January. Col. Knox went home on leave on 14th May 1919 and was replaced by Mr. H. F. Forbes, I.C.S., C.I.E., on 5th July 1919.It was not, however, until October that it was found possible to relieve Daoud Effendi Samra and Sulaiman Effendi Faizi from their other duties and thus complete the bench. By this time the considerable increase of work in appeal owing to the re-establishment of the Courts generally had necessitated a bench whose (whole energies would be devoted to appeal work. Mr. H. F. Forbes, the President of the Court, writes of the work of the Court of Appeal as follows : -&quot;The Court of Appeal reflects the gradual settling clown of &apos;Iraq to peace conditions both in the constitution of the Court and in the constant increase of work consequent on the reopening of the Courts generally throughout the country. A review of the past year&apos;s work would, therefore, be incomplete without a reference to the former Turkish judicial system and the gradual and successful progress achieved in making the Courts self-contained and independent of Constantinople.&quot; Up to the outbreak of war there were combined Civil and Criminal Courts of Appeal or Courts of First Instance with limited appellate powers in Basrah, Baghdad, Ba&apos;qubah, Karbala, Kirkuk, Muntafiq, Mosul, and Diwaniyah. Their decisions were final save that a further petition might be presented to the Court of Revision at Constantinople. This right of revision was. very necessary, owing to the composition of the benches. These were composed largely of men of straw, many of whom had little or no knowledge of law and were, in fact, little but dummies useful only in recording and enforcing the views of the President. The President was usually a Turk, and the work of the Court was entirely in his hands. If he were energetic and honest the outturn was excellent, but if not, the dummy tail could always be trusted to enforce his views by their majority vote. As a result every case which was appealed was taken on to the Court of Revision as a matter of course. The Court of Revision, however, had not power to issue a decree. It could confirm or set aside a decree, directing the Court of Appeal to issue a fresh decree. In this way cases usually took years to decide, and the whole bench had frequently changed when the case finally returned to the Court of First Instance.&quot;By the issue of the Appendix to the Code of Civil Procedure in All. 1328, compelling the appellant to appeal his case as a whole and not piecemeal as he had * done previously, and by the promulgation of the Peace Judges&apos; Law in A.H. 1329, restricting the right of appeal to sums over 50Z., the Turks had effected a much-needed
reform. The full effects of those changes, however, wore not yet (jviolent when war; broke out and practically put an end to all litigation. The Courts of Appeal had been overburdened with, such a mass of arrears that even in Mosul they had not been worked off in six years from A. 1.1. 1329-35.&quot; Our present Court lias a considerable advantage in. thus starting with a fairly clean slate which, indeed, Was made cleaner by the destruction of the Court records .generally throughout Iraq by the retreating Turkish Army. The enforcement of the new laws should make one bench sufficient to hear all appeals from Traq for some time to come. It is further to the advantage of the litigants that they should be able to employ the Baghdad liar in their appeals, as tho Bar outside Baghdad&apos;is for the most part of very mediocre quality. The whole country will benefit by the reduction in expenditure caused by combining eight Courts of Appeal into one. The opening up of communications will remove any hardship the litigants may find in coming to Baghdad. The formation of a strong and independent bench unlike the dummies -of the past will, I trust, more than compensate for the loss of the right of revision.&quot; I now turn to the revision of judgments of Peace Judges. As I have already stated, no appeal lies from a decree for less than 50/. ; there is, however, a light of revision. The procedure is as follows : The aggrieved party presents a petition to the Judge who heard the case, asking that his case may be referred to the Court of Revision. To this petition he may attach a memorandum. The Judge thereupon sends all. the papers of the case, together with the petition and -memorandum, to the Court of Appeal. Two Judges of the Court of Appeal thereupon go into the case on the papers. If they consider that the decree is correct the petition is rejected. If,, however, they are doubtful of its correctness a copy of the memorandum of appeal is sent to the other party for his reply. On receipt of his reply the whole bench of the Court of Appeal examines the case and gives a decision on the papers. The Court of Appeal does, however, give a final decision when possible, and not a mere order of remand as was done under the Turkish law. This is a very useful amendment of Turkish procedure, which, I believe, has given universal satisfaction. The Court of Appeal in Baghdad thus replaces the Court of Revision in Constantinople and completes the release of the Traq Courts from Turkish control.&quot;12. Civil Courts of First Instance and Peace Courts. Statistics of the work of the Civil Courts of First Instance and of the Peace Courts are contained in Appendix II.The Baghdad Civil Courts have throughout the year been under the Presidency of Mr. Bell.The total number of cases heard by the Baghdad Civil Courts in 1919 shows an increase over the number for 1918, although it was supposed that the large number in 1918 was due to the ending of the moratorium and to the fact that the Courts had been closed for nine months.Claims for pre-emption and for partition have figured noticeably in the list of cases, as a result no doubt of the high land values existing at the present time in Baghdad. There have been, no judgments for bankruptcy; in. several cases of insolvency the matter has been postponed under the Proclamation. The total court fees show a very large increase.The Execution Department has suffered to some extent from unavoidable changes in personnel.. Nevertheless, a large amount of work, often difficult and unpleasant, has been got through.The most noticeable addition to the Court&apos;s work is seen in the personal cases, both Shi&apos;ah and non-Mohammedans. Many of these were merely certificates of lieirship, but the fact that so many cases are decided with so little dissatisfaction the parties throws great credit on the Judges in charge of these cases.Thanks to the activity and tact of Major Holmclen, the President, the scope of the Hillah Civil Court has much widened during the year. Courts w^ere established at. Xarbala and Nejef and these towns were regularly visited, while occasional circuits-were undertaken to Diwaniyah and elsewhere.The population of the Divisions served by the Hillah Civil Court is almost entirely Shiah, and. there is a considerable prejudice against the employment of Mohammedan employees other than those of the Shi&apos;ah sect and some jealousy on the part of the Shi&apos;ah religious chiefs at the jurisdiction exercised by the Courts in Shi&apos;ah. personal cases. Owing to the fact that Shi&apos;ahs. were excluded from Government &quot;employment under the Turks, it is difficult to find Shi&apos;ahs with any legal experience, whether as Judges or clerks, and the Courts have been seriously handicappeel on this -account.2257 B
The population of Ba&apos;qubah had a bad reputation under the Turks for dishonesty and trickery in connection with the Courts. It is therefore.to be regretted, that the Court has been handicapped by changes of the President of the Courts. There has been a slight falling off of the number of cases instituted.At the beginning of the year the Courts of the Basrah Division, which since the occupation had been organised on Indian lines and to a great extent had been applying Indian law, were brought under the same regime as the Courts of the rest of the Occupied Territories. The change was effected without difficulty and has been welcomed by the population, since it replaces a foreign system of law and procedure by one with which they are familiar. This Court has also been much handicapped by necessary changes amongst the Presidents and Judges, but has got through a very large quantity of work.The Court of Wards, which was under the capable direction of Chaudhri Allah Bakhsh for the greater part of the year, and. under the general supervision of the Military Governor, has been carrying&apos; on a very beneficial work. At the end of the year it had under its control 64 estates of a total value of Rs. 11,42,188.The Mosul Court is the only Court in the Occupied. Territories which was taken over as a running concern from the Turks. As several of the Judges left with the Turks, it was possible at once to reorganise it. The number of Judges were reduced and their salaries increased. The Court, of which Major E. M. Drower was President for the greater part of the year, accomplished a satisfactory amount of work.New Peace Courts were opened in the course of the year at Amarah and Kirkuk.13. Mohammedan Law Courts. Statistics of the Sunni Shar&apos;ah Courts are set out in Appendix III.The only Courts at which the work was heavy were those of Baghdad and Mosul. At both the Government is fortunate in possessing honest and much respected Qadhis.The work of the Qadhis in the out districts is uneven and needs inspection. Most of the Qadhis are local men, who have had little previous experience of judicial. work, and were appointed rather because they were of good reputation and believed to be honest than on account of judicial knowledge.   Hitherto I have not been able to find an Arab lawyer suitable to undertake the work of inspection.Statistics of the work of the principal Shi&apos;ah Courts are set .out in Appendix II., together with those of the Civil Courts to which they are attached.The appointment of these courts has been fully justified. They have heard a large number of cases. The Government has been fortunate in obtaining the services of such widely respected men as Shaikh Shukrulla at Baghdad, Shaikh Jaafar Alwatch at Hillah, and Shaikh qassim&apos;s at Basrah. Owing to the difficulty of forming a Court of Appeal which would meet with acceptance throughout Mesopotamia, no Court of Appeal has yet been established, and it is therefore the more satisfactory that complaints or petitions against the decisions of these Judges have been very rare.Owing to the privileged position of the Shi&apos;ah religious chiefs, at Nejef and Karbala, the appointment of Shi&apos;ah Judges at those places present special difficulties,. since some part of the authority of the Shi&apos;ah religious chiefs has been derived from the fact that the Shi&apos;ahs have been accustomed to submit their disputes to their arbitration rather than to the Turkish Courts. An appointment has, however, recently been made for Karbala.14. Receipts of Civil and Religious Courts. The receipts of the Courts for the year were as follows : &apos;Rs.Appeal Courts    -        -        -        -        -        -    39,501Civil Courts (including Execution and Notary Public;   - 5,23.128 Peace Courts      -        -        -        -        -        -    89,902Shar&apos;ah Courts    -   .    -        -        -        -        -.1,10,19515. Criminal Courts. Statistics of the work of the Criminal Courts are contained in Appendix IV.The Criminal Procedure Regulations and the Penal Code, although intended only as temporary laws, to be replaced by more fully considered and finished laws on the conclusion of peace, have worked satisfactorily and have proved suitable for the requirements of the country. Many of the Magistrates have little previous experience of criminal law, but cases have been tried carefully and the punishments awarded, have in general been lenient.
As the country settled down to peace conditions, and the judicial stall; increased, it was possible to arrange that most serious crime should be tried by Sessions Courts composed of a British and two Arab Judges. This has the double advantage of providing a Court of trained Judges, and of associating Arabs with the British staff in the administration of justice.A considerable number of Arabs have also been appointed Magistrates of various classes.The administration of criminal law in this country is difficult, and demands in the Magistrates not only the possession of an intimate knowledge of the language and ideas of the people, but judicial experience and the exercise of much care. In many classes of cases the evidence is very unreliable. Perjurers may be divided into three main classes. First, there is the witness coming from the large uncivilised and uneducated classes, who has no knowledge of the value of evidence and fails to distinguish what he has himself observed from what he has been told or has inferred. Secondly, there is the witness who, having satisfied himself, very likely Avithout adequate grounds, that the accused is guilty, considers that the end justifies the means, and attempts to add to the value of his evidence by invented details. This class of evidence frequently occurs in cases of murder of which the motive is revenge or a tribal feud. Such murders are usually committed under circumstances which prevent the certain identification of the offender by any person present. It is known to the friends and relatives of; the murdered man that the murderer is one or other of a few individuals, and after a few hours&apos; discussion all present at the murder are-prepared to swear to the identity of the murderer or murderers. To men brought up under the tribal custom that the. tribe is responsible for a murder committed by any member of the tribe, it must seem of comparatively little importance which member of the tribe committed the murder.For the two forms of perjury already described, some excuse may be found in the ignorance and customs of the people. No such excuse can be offered for the down-right malicious perjurer. He is perhaps less common in. this country than in some countries which are usually considered more advanced. But an exception must be made in the case of persons who are themselves accused of a crime. The obtaining of evidence by the offer of free pardons to accomplices seems to have been a usual method adopted by the Turkish Police. The result is to give rise to a popular belief that the safest course for an accused person is to incriminate someone else. The evidence of accomplices, which in all countries is unreliable, is here especially so.Considering the unsatisfactory state of public order under the Turks, and that periods of war are usually followed by a considerable increase in crimes of violence, the amount of crime has been less than could have been expected, and is a striking-testimony to the efficiency of the administrative work of Political Officers. Public order has been well maintained. For some time after the occupation the Diyaleh Division was disturbed by some daring highway robberies; and the. same crime has been not uncommon in the Mosul Division. The capture and condemnation of the principal criminals in the Diyaleh Division has re-established order there/.In Mosul Division the conditions are more difficult, but public order has been steadily improving.During the year the death sentence was carried out on 28 individuals.There are two forms of crime which are regrettably common and are so ingrained in the habits of the people that they will be difficult to eradicate. The first is murder from motives of revenge or from a grudge. Such murders are often accompanied by circumstances of great brutality. A man will be in wait at night at the door of his enemy&apos;s house and shoot him as he comes out of his house. Or a band of men will make their way at night to the house of their victim, and shoot him while he is -sleeping in his bed in the midst of his family.The second is murder by her family of a girl or married woman who has been unchaste. Amongst tribal Arabs in this or in other countries there is no pity for the-girl who has lapsed from the strict path of virtue. She has put a stain on the family honour that can only be washed out by her blood. But in Mesopotamia this feeling extends beyond the limits of tribesmen proper. And if the cases which have come before me during the last year are characteristic, the custom in this country differs discreditably from that observed by Arabs elsewhere. For here it would seem that the members of the giiTs family do not, as elsewhere, risk their lives by meting out to the girls lover the same fate as to the girl herself.The Tribal Criminal and Civil Disputes Regulations provides a procedure for the trial by.a tribal mejlis appointed by the Political Officer of offences committed by
stribesmen, and for their punishment approximately in accordance with tribal law. The Regulations are valuable in enabling Political Officers to deal with cases between tribesmen who, owing to their inaccessibility or for other reason, are not under strict Government control, and with regard to whom the Government is not prepared to accept full responsibility for law and order; as also with cases between tribesmen, when the evidence is not sufficient for trial by an ordinary Criminal Court, but the facts are well known within the tribe and can be dealt with by a tribal mejlis who have sources of information which are not open to a Law- Court. The punishments which may be awarded under the Tribal Criminal and Civil Disputes Regulations are limited to fine and imprisonment. A death sentence cannot be passed except by the ordinary Criminal Courts.According to tribal law minor offences are punishable by compensation and line. For murder, the law is a life for a life. It is the duty of the relatives of the murdered man to avenge his death, but they may compound the crime by accepting a fine, and in this country are usually willing to do so. The object of vengeance is not limited to the murderer. If the murderer and murdered man belong to different families in the same sub-tribe, the relatives of the murdered man have the right to kill any one man of the murderer&apos;s family. If the murderer and murdered man belong to different sub-tribes, vengeance lies against any one man of the murderer&apos;s sub-tribe. If the murderer and murdered man belong to different tribes, vengeance lies against any one man of the murderer&apos;s tribe. So also the fine is payable not solely by the murderer, but by his family, sub-tribe, or tribe, as the case may be. For murder or other serious crime, a tribesman may also be banished from his tribe.Tribal law is not an effective deterrent to crime, in that the liability to punish-ment lies not on the individual who commits the crime, but the family, sub-tribe or tribe to which he belongs. The share of a blood line which the actual criminal in fact pays may thus be insignificant. There was a tendency in some divisions for Political Officers to make use of its provisions in cases which could be more effectively dealt with by the ordinary Courts. A circular was accordingly issued pointing out the limits within which the use of the Tribal Disputes Regulations should be confined.It has naturally not been possible in the short time since the occupation, to form an efficient and thoroughly disciplined police force throughout the country. Speaking generally, the investigation and detection of crime is the weakest point in the adminis-tratioii of criminal law. Several, divisions, of which Baghdad deserves special mention, must, however, be excepted from this statement. In most of the country districts police officials and magistrates had no previous training or experience in the investigation of crime. In a country where evidence is so unreliable, it is of special importance that every serious crime should be thoroughly investigated on the spot at the earliest possible moment after the commission of the crime. Witnesses should be examined separately, and if possible before they have had an opportunity of communicating with one another. I therefore welcome the approaching reorganisation of the Divisional Police Forces under the supervision of an Inspector-General of Police.16. The Bar. No effective measures were taken under the Turkish Government to confine the practice of advocacy in Mesopotamia to qualified advocates. One of the first reforms introduced upon the re-establishment of the Civil Court in Baghdad after the occupation was the issue of &quot;The Advocates&apos; Rules, 1918,&quot; regulating the profession, of advocate.These rules require all advocates to take out a licence and provide that, subject to certain exceptions, licences should be limited to persons who hold a diploma from a recognised Law School. Exception, however, was made in favour of advocates who were in actual practice although they possessed no legal diploma.Consequent upon the opening of communications with the outside world after the Armistice, a considerable number of advocates have returned to Baghdad.At the end of December there were some 60 licensed&apos; advocates at Baghdad, 12 at Basrah and 3 at Mosul.Although the standard of the legal knowledge of many of these is not such as to qualify them for a learned profession, there are competent lawyers amongst them, and the Bar at Baghdad is taking a useful and creditable part in the administration of justice.17. Comparison of existing- Courts with Turkish Courts. In concluding this summary of the work of the Courts in 1919, some comparison is called for between the existing courts and the former Turkish Courts.   It has been stated that the
IV.-Law School.18. A. Law School had been in existence at Baghdad for some seven years before the outbreak of war. The course was a four years&apos; course. At the outbreak of wxar the school was closed down. Hence the students in their first, second and third years were deprived of the opportunity of obtaining a diploma and of qualifying themselves for practice at the bar or for judicial appointments.Upon the conclusion of the Armistice, the re-opening of the school became an urgent question, and after the financial difficulties had been overcome, the necessary arrangements were made to reopen the school. Having regard, to the difficulties of organisation and of obtaining an adequate staff of teachers, it was decided that for the first year the school should be confined to pupils of the old law school whose studies had been interrupted by the war. The school was reopened with some 50 pupils divided into two classes. The fee is Rs. 150 for a year&apos;s course. Teaching is wholly in Arabic.Mr. H. F. Forbes, the President of the Court of Appeal, undertook the duties of Honorary Director and the school owes much to his enthusiasm and sympathy. . Nishat Effendi Sanawi was appointed Vice-Director. They have been fortunate in obtaining as lecturers some of the most capable judges and advocates, who have patriotically given their services to the cause of legal education.The school was formally opened by the Civil Commissioner on the 7th November in the presence of a representative gathering of notables of Baghdad. A. message was subsequently received from the Secretary of State for India conveying his good wishes for the future of the school and was communicated to the students and the staff.2257 Cexisting Courts follow Turkish procedure, and, with the exception of a few British judges, are staffed by Arab judges and clerks. Mow far, then, are they superior to the old Turkish Courts ? Without attempting to be exhaustive, one may draw attention to the following considerations : (1) The work of the Courts is conducted in Arabic and. all the records of the Civil Court are kept in Arabic, instead of, as formerly, in Turkish, a foreign language in Mesopotamia.(2) The Judges of the Civil Courts arc honest. The dishonesty of the Turkish Courts is proverbial in the East, and anyone who takes the trouble to make enquiries from residents in this country, who had means of knowing, cannot fail to be convinced that their evil reputation in this respect was well deserved.It is said that during the last 40 years before the occupation there were only two Qadhis of the Baghdad Shar&apos;ah Court who were honest. There are men living at Baghdad who, in the course of a few years&apos; tenure of a poorly paid Qadhiship, advanced from extreme poverty to wTealth. I had occasion recently to read the reports and accounts of the administrator of the estate of a British subject domiciled in Baghdad, who died a few months before the war. In the course of the administration, it became necessary to register some documents in the Qadhi&apos;s Court.. A visit was paid by the administrator to.the court, and he was assured by the Qadhi that the work was straightforward and would give rise to no difficulty. The heirs attended the court on several occasions, but were constantly&quot; put off. One&apos; of them, realising the cause of the delay, had an interview with the Qadhi and promised him a commission upon the completion of the work. No further postponement was then necessary, and the accounts of the estate in the records of the British Consulate contain the entry: &quot; To the Qadhi for his trouble  T. 15.&quot; The work in this case being non-litigious, no wresting of justice was involved. But bribery was not confined to non-litigious work, nor to the Qadhi&apos;s Court. I have been informed bv merchants of standing that they could never obtain justice without paying for it.(3) Cases are heard with reasonable promptitude both in the Courts of First Instance and in appeal. The inordinate delays to which the Turkish system of appeal, both in civil and criminal cases, lent itself, is a thing of the past.(4) By reducing the number of the courts, by careful selection of the judges and by increasing their pay, the status of judges has been raised and a higher degree of competency has been obtained.On the other hand, the civil courts are still hampered by mediasval rules of evidence and antique laws.
The reopening of the school has been very generally welcomed by the educated classes in Baghdad. Hitherto it has not been possible to find suitable accommodation for the school. The classes are being temporarily carried on in the Court Rooms, an arrangement which is as inconvenient to the Courts as it is to the students.V.--Legislation.19. The following Proclamations and legislation of a civil character were issued during the course of the year :  Proclamations issued by the General Officer Commanmsg-in-Chief.12th Feb.  1919. Inland Steam Vessels Act,14th Mar.  1919. Sea Customs Act.1st Apr.  1919. Land Acquisition Amendment Proclamation.23rd Apr. 1919. Tax (Execution; Proclamation.26th Apr.  1919.

Civil Courts Fees Rules, 1919.Captain E. 0. Mousley was appointed to the post of Chief Legislative Draftsman at the end of the year, and about the same time the services of Ahmed Effendi Hilrni, an Egyptian advocate, were obtained to supervise, amongst other duties, the translation of legislation.Company Registration.20. The Companies Proclamation, 1919, applied the Indian Companies Acts, subject to some slight modifications, to Mesopotamia,In accordance, however, with Turkish law, no company may be registered except -with the permission of the Civil Commissioner. Considering that the native commercial community have no experience of company direction, and that -the financial conditions of the country are favourable to an undesirable form of speculation-lation, this is a wise precaution.Two companies, both under British direction, were registered in the last six months of the year.VI- Personnel. *21. A list of the principal officers holding appointments in the Judicial Department on the 31st December 19.19 is contained in Appendix V.The following table shows the nationality of the judicial and clerical staff as on the 31st December 1919 : British, 10; Indian, 4; Arab (Mohammedan), 197; Arab (Jewish), 9; Arab (Christian), 9; Egyptian, 1; Syrian, 1.
It may be mentioned that the British staff contains representatives of the-following races : Scotch, Irish, Welsh, New Zealanclers, Jewish and English.During the war, the scope of the Department was limited to satisfying essential requirements, and was carried on with a minimum of British personnel. It was recognised that the administration of civil justice, although a necessary consequence of the result of the occupation of Mesopotamia, did not justify any avoidable demand for British staff which, would take officers away from military duties. With the conclusion of the armistice, it was hoped that it would be possible to obtain a moderate increase of staff sufficient to enable Courts to be established throughout the country. But it was not until the end of 1919 that any increase to the staff was in fact made. There has been, therefore, a severe strain on the staff and especially on the British members, few of whom have had leave since before the war. I take the opportunity of bringing to your notice.the admirable work performed by them in circumstances of exceptional difficulty. It is a pleasure to be able to add that the relations between the British and Mesopotamian members of the staff have been of a most harmonious and cordial character.VII-Court Buildings.22. After occupying various not very suitable billets, the Judicial Department and Courts at Baghdad, together with the Awqaf Department, were allotted the old Turkish Military School. Both as regards accommodation and situation, these buildings are very suitable for Law Courts, although the requirements of the Department are already outgrowing the available accommodation.In most of the other stations the Courts are not adequately housed, and new buildings are urgently required. Mesopotamia, like the rest of the world, is, as a consequence of the war, very short of houses, and one of the difficulties in the way of opening new Courts is the absence of housing for the officials.VIII-Conclusion-23. I trust that the foregoing report is a sufficient account of the work of the Judicial Department during the year 1919.The principal events of the year have been the re-establishment in the Basrah Wilayet of the same system of Courts and legal procedure as in the rest of Mesopotamia, the constitution of a separate Court of Appealj and the reopening of the Law School.Until peace is signed and a regular Government established, it would be premature to make important changes in the organisation of the Courts or in. the laws applied by them. The energies of the staff have during the last year been in the main devoted to administering the existing laws efficiently and to introducing such improvements as are possible without legislation of a radical nature.Before, however, the Courts can take their full share in contributing to the creation of the better society, which the bravery and sacrifices of the British and Allied armies have put within the reach of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, con-siderable legislation will be necessary. Amongst other matters on which legislation is required, perhaps the most urgent are the questions of Consular jurisdiction and the revision of the Code of Civil Law.E.
