tocumeiCirculated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of Slate for India,ord September 1920.Following is weekly telegram : Non-official Members of Council issued manifesto emphatically disapproving policy and principle of non-co-operation, and expressing deliberate conviction that movement can do no good but is fraught with harm to best interests of country. It will introduce elements of disorder and results would be fatal to successful working of Reforms Act on which future of country largely depends. It was signed by Raja of Mahmudabad, Maharaja of Kasimbazar, Surendra Nath. Banerjee, Sir Dcva Prasad Sarvadliikarz, M. Srinavasca Sastri, Sunder Singh Majithia, Mir Asad Ali, R. D. Tata, Col. Umar Hyat Khan, Khan Sahib Bhuttoo, Syecl Mahomed Ali, and following have since subscribed, to it: Sir Dinshaw Wacha, Sir Gangadhar Chitnavis, Sacliidananda Sinha and. Abdur Raliira.In provinces non-co-operation movement gaining nominal support but producing no appreciable results. Central Provinces Congress Committee lias passed resolution in favour. Special Congress meets this week and some members, of Legislative Council gone to Calcutta for it, including Patel and Khaparde, some at .least professedly to oppose movement. Appeal issued byLajpatRai to moderates asking for. unity and attendance Calcutta, but few have made response. Surendra Nath Banerjee issued statement explaining absolute uselessness of attending Congress packed with extremists.GaudhPs tour in Madras not successful; most prominent of Nationalist leaders, though giving him ovation on arrival, kept aloof from his meetings, deserting him, as one newspaper expressed it, like rats in sinking ship. Nationalists now divided in Madras. Very few firm adherents to Gandhi; others think movement unconstitutional; others accept principle but do not accept any programme so far put forward. Owing to apparent failure of attempt to secure practical support of lawyers, Gandhi has appealed to students. He also attacked Viceroy, questioning his sincerity over Moslem question, and calling him a hypocrite.In United Provinces elaborate programme accepted by Provincial Committee, first stage, including (a) giving up titles and honorary distinctions; (6) substitution of arbitration instead of recourse to Government courts; (c) promotion of national education by establishing national schools and. colleges and gradually withdrawing students from Government institutions; (d) resignation from all honorary posts in public bodies other than those conferred by people; (e) refusal to participate in any official or semi-official function or levee; (g) (sic) boycott of British goods. But movement makes but little progress in United Provinces or Punjab in spite of activity of extremist leaders.Genuineness of Amirs proclamation regarding Muhajarin at first not believed in, and extremist section of vernacular Press continued to encourage movement, but return of emigrants with stories of hardships undergone at last convinced even most sceptical that movement must for the present at least be abandoned. Anti-Government feeling in Punjab still very marked. Local Government propose to prosecute Zafar Ali of Zamiiidar for violent speeches delivered in Attock district. In North-West Frontier Province, except for critical situation in Hazara, reported by Foreign and Political Department, AirnYs order has had sobering effect in Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan, with result Hijrat movement become unpopular there. No sign of disorder anywhere except Hazara. We have applied Seditious Meetings Act to this district, and have sanctioned internment of two Mullahs in British India.  Last news from this district more encouraging.In Bombay, prohibition at first generally believed to be device of British Government, but now realised as fact. Chairman, local Hijrat Committee, claimed he had by reason of it dissuaded 200 prospective Muhajarins from carrying out intention of emigrating. Three Mohamedans prosecuted in Bombay under section 10S, Code of Criminal Procedure, convicted, and having refused to furnish security for good behaviour, sent to jail for one year&apos;s rigorous imprisonment, unless security furnished.Before opening of Council on 31st August, Viceroy made feeling reference to assassination of Willoughby, Deputy Commissioner, Kheri, United Provinces, reported 2241     100 9.20
tseparately. Surendra Nath Banerjee, voicing opinion of non-official members, expressed deep sorrow and abhorrence at dastardly outrage, sympathising with relatives of deceased, and considered Government (? required) (? have not had) moral support in maintenance of law and order. Murder directly traceable to Khilafat propaganda working on ignorant and fanatical minds, and loyal Mohamedans realise danger of movement spreading to masses. Leading assassin, who is person with three or four previous convictions for burglary, and one for assault on Deputy Magistrate, and one accomplice arrested, but third accomplice not yet caught. General mourning in Kheri; all shops, schools, and other institutions closed. Sir 11. Butler attended funeral, at which large crowds present, and afterwards addressed general meeting of citizens called to express abhorrence at cowardly murder, warning against itinerant agitation, and calling on loyal citizens for support in maintenance of law and order, and preventing agitation, kindling fanatical feeling, and leading to very (? group omitted).Considerable interest aroused by announcement of recommendations of Corn-mission on Egypt. In some quarters it is described as first victory of Islam, and in others, for example Independent, Allahabad, as master stroke of policy and certain to increase menace to India&apos;s freedom and future, but while complicating course of evolution of national freedom in India likely to impart new inspiration and strength to Nationalist movement, and call forth determination of people to win legitimate freedom without waiting upon pleasure of. British politicians, but forcing their hands to do the same thing by India as by Egypt.Much indignation expressed against proposal to erect slaughter house at Ratona, Central Provinces, in connection with Davenport &amp; Co.&apos;s Central Provinces Tanning and Trading Company, who were brought in to replace previous insanitary and unscientific conditions by up-to-date methods. Meetings of protest held in Bombay, Calcutta, and elsewhere, and resolutions in local council. Chief Commissioner agreed to suspend construction until mixed committee of officials and non-officials had issued draft rules under the Slaughter of Animals Act.Jallianwala Bagh has now been purchased for Rs. 5,00,000 after case had gone to court.
