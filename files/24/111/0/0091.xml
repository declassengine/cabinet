This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.SECRETCP. [1.88!y&amp;JJ THE CABINET.(in,------------.............xs-&apos;/supply OF CLOTHING AND BOOTS TO POLAND.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate below a memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the question of supplying Poland, through the French authorities, with certain articles of clothing and equipment.W.S.C.The War Ojffice,25th September, 1920.The question of supplying stores to Poland has not yet been settled, but in view of the approach of winter and the urgent appeals recently made to us by the Polish Staff, an early decision is called for.While it is clear that the Poles are genuinely anxious to conclude peace with the Soviet Government of Russia, they cannot but regard the future with anxiety in view of the repeated instances of the Soviets duplicity and the openly expressed intention of the latter to destroy &quot; White Poland,&quot; The Polish Government are therefore bound to take every possible precaution for their future safety, especially since the recent crisis proved that they can look to no one but themselves for help in the event of aggression either by Russia or Germany.Under the terms of the Peace Treaty and in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations, France and Great Britain are jointly responsible for the support of Poland against unprovoked attack. But recent events have made it clear that public opinion in this country will not tolerate armed intervention even in the clearest case of aggression by Poland&apos;s enemies, and it is probable that no great change in popular feeling is likely to take place in the immediate future.The Polish Army is now urgently in need of clothing and boots, the lack of which will have a deplorable effect during the coming winter. The French Government, who can supply practically all other requirements, have asked us to assist with these items of which we have a fairly large supply. If these deficiencies can be supplied promptly, it may go far towards preventing a recurrence of the critical situation from which the Polish Army has just extricated itself, and may thus save us from finding ourselves in the invidious position of being unable to carry out our Treaty obligations.I venture to urge, therefore, that Cabinet approval may be given to the principle of supplying to Poland on payment, through the French authorities, such items of clothing and equipment as we can spare. * The exact amount available will depend upon whether the Greek Government will require all the stores originally set aside for them, in view of the fact that the number of Greek divisions originally contemplated are not likely now to be kept mobilized.Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff.* This proposal is separate from and additional to the free gift of certain stores, equipment and ammunition which is dealt with in Cabinet Paper No. 18(36 of 18th September.(B20/394)   100  9/uO  H&amp;S, Ltd.   8564wo
