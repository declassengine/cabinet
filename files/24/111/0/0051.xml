PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The principal event of the week has been the opening of the Trades Union Congress at Portsmouth on the 6th September. An account of the proceedings on the first three days is given below. As compared with last year, when the Parliamentary Committee received a notable defeat, the proceedings have been quiet. Interest especially attaches to the discussion on the coal mines situation, which took place on the 8th. A resolution was adopted endorsing the miners&apos; claims, but offering no more than moral support. The attitude of the trade unions to the Unemployment Insurance Act was raised on the report of the Parliamentary Committee, but a decision has been postponed until the substantive resolutions on this subject are taken up.The strike notices issued by the miners expire on the 25 th September. The most important event of the week in this connection is the arrangement made on the 7th and 8th September for a further meeting between the President of the Board of Trade and the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation, to take place on the 9th.The lock-out notices issued to members of the Electrical Trades Union employed by federated engineering firms took effect on the 6th September. In view of the grave situation created, the Minister is setting up a Court of Inquiry into the issues involved in the dispute. The employers, however, refuse to suspend the lock-out notices pending the report of the Court, and this is provoking threats of sympathetic strikes on the part of other members of the Electrical Trades Union.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 27th August was 143,186, made up of 142,600 lodged by men and 586 by women. On the 20th August there were 139,024 policies current, 138,405 for men and 619 for women. (1 ;  On the 27th August, 82,406 unemployment books, 56,977 for males and 25,429 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Compared with the previous week, when there were 55,108 books lodged by males and 23,794 by females, the total increase is 3,504.The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 340.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Labour and Russia. The only further development to report in the attitude of Labour towards the Kusso-Polish situation is a meeting of the National Council of Action at Portsmouth on the 5th September, the eve of the Trades Union Congress. In view of the appeal made by the Polish Socialist Party, the declarations made by the Russians, the failure of the Minsk negotiations, and the conflicting statements which had appeared, it was decided to appoint Mr. W. Adamson, M.P., and Mr. A. A. Purcell to proceed to Riga, to obtain accurate first-hand information as to the present situation.Labour and Ireland. No important developments have occurred. On the 3rd September, an appeal for the release of the Lord Mayor of Cork was addressed to the Prime Minister and the Government by prominent Labour leaders. This appeal was signed by Messrs. W. Adamson, J. Bromley, E. Bevin, R. Smillie, R. Williams, G. Lansbury, Ben Turner and J. Robertson. On the 5th, the Lord Privy Seal issued a statement denning the Government^ attitude towards the Lord Mayor of Cork, in reply to the joint appeal made by the Parliamentary Labour Party, the National Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, noted last week.
Housing.-The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, at their annual conference last month, adjourned the consideration of the Governmenfs housing proposals for a special conference, which was held in London on the 31st August and the 1st September. At this meeting, the question of the apprenticeship of ex-Service men was brought up, and a resolution was passed expressing the opinion that the number of apprentices under the training scheme has reached the limit, and recommending the executives of affiliated unions to notify the Minister of Labour that they will not recognise any credentials from men entering training after the 30th September. No decision was come to on the question of dilution, which was discussed at great length, whereas definite opposition was expressed to the introduction of any form of payment by results.The annual conference of the Labour Housing Association was held on the 4th September at Portsmouth. Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., presided at the morning session, and Mr. J. Bromley at the afternoon session. resolutions were carried condemning the &quot; dilatoriness &quot; of the Government in supplying the necessary money for carrying through housing schemes, and calling upon the Treasury, to provide money out of the national revenue. The system of raising money by the issue of housing bonds was condemned, a levy on capital being proposed as an alternative. A further resolution protested against the 25 per cent, increase on rents allowed under the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. The conference ended by welcoming the introduction of the guild principle into the building industry, and endorsing the policy of the guilds already in existence with regard to the method of payment and the dedication of profits to. the improvement of the industry.Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. There is nothing fresh to report in connection with the agitation in Scotland. It is evident that the demonstration strike of the 23rd August has not been followed up to the extent desired by the organisers. Reports that the increases due under the Act have so far been paid promptly are sub-stantiated by a statement to the members of the Glasgow Property Owners&apos; and Factors&apos; Association that rents are being paid as punctually and freely as in the past, so that the Association do not consider it necessary to formulate any policy with regard to the matter at present. On the other hand, the promoters of the agitation state that they are satisfied with the resistance in Glasgow, and the campaign there and in outlying districts is being strenuously maintained by means of meetings and propaganda work. It is expected that the conference to be held on the 2nd October will arrange for fresh demonstrations and endeavour to place resistance on an organised footing.Merchant Shipping M.-The text of this Bill, introduced on the 16th August by Mr. J. Sexton, M.P., has now been issued. The Bill derives its importance from the fact that it summarises the policy of the seamen&apos;s unions with regard to the amendment of the Merchant Shipping Acts. Clause 11, dealing with hours of labour, seems out of place in it. The memorandum prefixed to the Bill explains that it is intended to amend the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894-1920, in several important particulars, and to make a large number of minor amendments desirable in view of the &quot;proposed consolidation of the Merchant Shipping Acts &quot; and other enactments relating to. merchant shipping.* The Bill also deals with Section 7 of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1906, which relates to seamen. It contains 41 clauses, and covers a variety of topics. Clause 11 provides that, except in cases of emergency (proof whereof shall in any penal proceedings rest upon the accused person), no seamen or apprentices to the sea service shall be employed on or in connection with any British ship for longer than 8 hours a day or 48 hours a week. Clause 7 provides that, where the service of a seaman terminates before the date contemplated in his agree-ment by reason of the wreck or loss of the ship, he shall be entitled to wages until he arrives at a proper return port. Clause 35 deprives the Board of Trade of the dispensing powers conferred upon them by Section 78 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906. Clause 22 amends the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1906, in order to extend its provisions to all &quot;share fishermen &quot; and to men in the herring industry, notwithstanding anything in the terms of their agreement obliging them to share losses. Other provisions deal with discipline, safety and welfare.   The Bill is supported by Messrs. Clynes, Wignall and Tillett.Ministry of Food. A statement has been issued on behalf of the Consumers&apos; Council protesting against the decision of the Government to take steps to discontinue the bread subsidy.   They consider that the Governmenfs decision is calculated to aggravate* A Eeconimendation was adopted by the Genoa International Labour Conference, that members of the International Labour Organisation should undertake, each for their own country, &quot; the formulation of a seamen&apos;s code.&quot;
hardships at the season when climatic and industrial conditions are at their worst, and that by the total abolition of the subsidy the Government are virtually converting an impost borne by the whole community into a heavy and inequitable burden to be borne, in the main, by the poorer part of the population. The Council recognise that some steps must be taken to prevent the bread subsidy from increasing still further, and suggest that the proposal to reduce the cost of bread by eliminating inefficient bakeries should be further examined. They declare that the removal of the subsidy must inevitably cause discontent, and possibly bread riots, among the poor.Police, Factories, etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1916. The Home Secretary has given notice of his intention to make an Order under this Act, providing for the welfare of workers employed in textile factories and workshops, print works, bleaching and dyeing works, and rope works. Its provisions will make it compulsory on the employer to supply protective clothing for workpeople engaged on wet, dusty or noxious processes, adequate dressing and cloak-room accommodation, first-aid appliances, with an ambulance room where 500 or more persons are employed, and other means to promote the general welfare of the employees. Objections to the proposed Order will be received by the Home Secretary within 21 days from the 3rd September, and, in certain circumstances, small deputations of employers will be enabled to meet the Chief Inspector of Factories and discuss matters of detail relating to the Order.Industrial and Oilier Organisations.Trades Union Congress. The 52nd annual Trades Union Congress opened at Ports-mouth on the 6th September, and will continue in session throughout the week. The first day was taken up with formal procedure, 950 delegates being welcomed on behalf of the town by the Mayor of Portsmouth and, on behalf of the organised workers, by the chairman of the  Portsmouth Trades Council. Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., then delivered the presidential address and spoke at some length in defence of the Council of Action, and on the situation in Ireland. His severe criticism of the Governments policy in regard to the Lord Mayor of Cork evoked great applause, as did the proposal to send a telegram to the Government, in the name of the whole organised labour movement, demanding the Lord Mayor&apos;s release.  The motion to send this message was carried unanimously.In the afternoon, the delegates began the consideration of resolutions on the agenda. With regard to housing, a resolution was carried instructing the Parliamentary Committee to oppose any increase of rent beyond 10 per cent, of the standard rent, until the normal supply of houses is available. The National Federation of Women Workers submitted a resolution calling upon the Government to give immediate effect to all the Draft Con-ventions adopted by the International Labour Conference at Washington, by the intro-duction of suitable legislation.In the course of a speech by Mr. John Turner, of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, the Ministry were criticised for their alleged delay in setting up Trade Boards for the distributive trades.The second day was mainly taken up with the consideration of the report of the Parliamentary Committee, which was approved after some discussion. The chief point was that raised by Mr. Smillie, who moved that a paragraph in the report recommending that an amendment of Standing Orders, passed at last year&apos;s Congress, to the effect that in future the election of the Parliamentary Committee should be conducted by the method of proportional representation, be suspended for the year, should be deleted, and that the amendment should be carried out, in view of the practice of bartering votes which now exists. This question was dropped after a rather heated debate, and the motion was not put to the vote. The report of the Labour Delegation to Russia was then presented by Mr. A. A. Purcell, and approved. Other resolutions dealt with on this day were those dealing with war wealth and a capital levy, methods of rendering the resolutions of Congress more effective, sympathetic action, and the inclusion of agricultural workers in the Hours of Employment Bill.On the 8th the coal situation was discussed. Mr. Frank Hodges put the miners&apos; case before the delegates in an effective speech, and the opinion of the Congress was then embodied in a resolution &quot; that this Trades Union Congress, having heard the statement of the miners&apos; case for the reduction in the price of domestic coal by 14s. 2d. per ton, and an advance of wages of 2s., Is. and 9d. per shift for adults, youths and boys respec-tively, is of opinion that the claims are both reasonable and just and should be conceded forthwith.&quot;  This resolution, which was carried unanimously, clearly commits the trade
union movement to nothing beyond an expression of opinion on the merits of the miners&apos; claims, and merely offers moral support. Mr. Thomas was careful to point out in his speech that no one more strongly desired to avoid a stoppage than responsible trade union leaders throughout the country, and general discussion on the statement of the miners&apos; case was not encouraged.The Congress also considered the refusal of the Government to allow the Russian trade union delegation to enter this country. The only dissentient to the resolution protesting against this refusal was Mr. Havelock Wilson, M.P. The rest of the session was occupied with discussion on an interim report of the Joint Committee on the Cost of Living, which was presented by Mr. Arthur Greenwood.Trade Union Topics.Monmouthshire and South Wales Colliery Enginemen, Stokers&apos; and Craftsmen&apos;s Associa-tion. A special delegate meeting of the association was held at Cardiff on the 2nd Sep-tember., Delegates were present representing over 6,000 members. It was decided, by 118 votes to 14, to recommend the acceptance of the scheme for amalgamation with the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, as revised by Sir Walter Nicholas. It was further decided to take a ballot of the members on the scheme. The association agreed to endorse the present demands of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.Ex-Service Men.Employment of Ex-Service Men. The Minister has written to The Times, giving an encouraging account of the progress made in the resettlement of ex-Service men since the publication of Lord Haig&apos;s appeal in the Press on the 10th August.* He announced that the Government have granted extensive powers to the Ministry of Labour, in con-junction with the Treasury, to conduct a further review of Government offices, in order to obviate the necessity for discharging ex-Service men who would otherwise have suffered in the process of reducing Government staffs to permanent peace dimensions.In addition to the conference of Mayors and Chairmen of District Councils in London and the Home Counties on the 8th September, summoned by the Lord Mayor of London to concert measures for local action, a conference is to be held at Birmingham on the 15th September, consisting of members of the Greater Birmingham Employment Committee and Local Technical Advisory Committees, the Birmingham Distress Committee, the Chamber of Commerce, the Trades and Labour Council, and other representative bodies. A public meeting in Manchester on the.31st August, called by the Lord Mayor, recorded its determination to find employment for every unemployed ex-Service man in the city. A committee, representative of the Corporation, the Employment Exchange, the Chamber of Commerce, federations of employers, ex-Service men&apos;s associations, trade unions, and the Trades Council, was formed to give effect to the will of the meeting.Disclwrges of Ex-Service Men (Bristol).-Attention was drawn last week to the unrest among Bristol ex-Service men over the pending discharges of temporary post-office workers in that city. It is now reported that all ex-Service men&apos;s organisations throughout the country have been acquainted with the facts of the case, and that the whole matter has been put in the charge of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers.Amalgamation of Ex-Service Organisations. At a conference in Edinburgh, the prin-ciple of amalgamation was agreed upon between the Scottish Grand Council of the Comrades of the Great War and the&apos;Scottish Federation, of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers. The new organisation is to be non-party political, and its membership is to be confined strictly to ex-Service men. Four representatives of each organisation will be appointed to examine the draft constitution of the proposed new amalgamation of ex-Service organisations in England, before the matter is submitted to the branches.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Coal Miners (National). On the 2nd September the delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain decided that strike notices should be issued in every district, to expire on the 25th September. At a resumed meeting of the Triple Alliance, on the 1st September, it was decided to appoint a sub-committee to remain in continuous session, and also to initiate a publicity campaign in support of the miners&apos; demands. The leaders accordingly presented a full statement of the miners&apos; case to a conference of Press represen-tatives on the 3rd September. The statement emphasises the point that the two parts of the miners&apos; claims stand together and are indivisible.Sir Robert Home, in statements to the Press, has intimated that, in so far as the miners&apos; claim was a wage claim and not a question of policy, the Industrial Court was the appro-priate body to decide it. The Court might be composed, if the miners desired, of representa-tives of employers and workers in the coal industry in addition to the chairman. The demand for a reduction in price involved a question of policy which could only be referred to the House of Commons, who, however, had already indicated their attitude on the subject. The Government did not intend to go back on their decision. On the afternoon of the 7th September, the Federation issued a statement that they had received no official communication of the proposals of the President of the Board of Trade for a solution of the deadlock. A few hours later Sir Robert Home sent the following telegram to Mr. K. Smillie: &quot; In order to avoid, any misunderstanding as to our respective points of view, I should be glad if you would bring your executive to the Board of Trade on Thursday, 9th instant, to discuss the present position.&quot; Mr. Eobert Smillie convened a meeting of the executive of the Federation at &quot;which this invitation was accepted.-Engineers and Shipbuilders (National).-A conference of the Engineering and Shipbuild-ing Trades Federation was held in London on the 3rd September. It was unanimously decided that each union affiliated to the federation should give notice to terminate their participation in the agreement made in February, 1917, with the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations, then the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, which provided for four-monthly hearings on wages claims before the Industrial Court. The last awards,* made under the 1917 agreement, operate until the 30th November.Taxi-cab Drivers (London). The joint committee of the Motor-Cab Owner Drivers&apos; Association, the Motor-Cab Proprietors&apos; Association, and the owner-drivers&apos; branch of the United Vehicle Workers propose to charge drivers \d. per mile as a contribution towards the increased cost of petrol. This contribution is to operate from the 9th September until the Home Office sanction increased fares for taxi-cabs. The drivers have so far refused to agree to this payment and it is possible that some taxi-cabs may be withdrawn. A mass meeting of the members of the United Vehicle Workers who are affected will be held on the 12th September to review the position.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Electricians (Penistone). Efforts were made during the week both by the Ministry and by the Negotiating Committee set up by the National Federation of General Workers to settle the Penistone dispute. On the 2nd September the Negotiating Committee met representatives of the Electrical Trades Union and the employers, both separately and together. Proposals were submitted, but no compromise could be reached which would leave employers free to appoint as foreman anyone whom they considered qualified, without reference to trade union membership, and, at the same time, guarantee that existing prac-tices remained unaltered. The employers refused to agree to any clause which bound them to adhere to existing practices in the various localities. For the negotiations in which the Ministry were concerned see p. 354 below.Platers&apos; Helpers (Clyde). It is estimated that approximately 3,700 platers&apos; helpers are on strike in the Clyde shipyards over the amount to be paid by platers to their helpers under Industrial Court Award No. 405. Unsuccessful efforts to effect a settlement were made at a conference on the 30th August between the Clyde Shipbuilders&apos; Association, the Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers, and* Awards Nos. 395 and 396,13th July, 1920.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.the National Amalgamated Union of Labour. The Clyde Shipbuilders&apos; Association now threaten to lock-out both the platers and their helpers unless work is resumed by the 8th September.Lace Operatives, Plain Net Section (Nottingham). The position remains unchanged in the strike of lace operatives* which began in Nottingham on the 11th June.Furniture Workers (Leeds). The strike of furniture workers, f which began on the 14th June, continues, but during the week the employers made an offer which included the pay-ment of the 2s. 4d. per hour demanded by the men. This is the district rate recently gran-ted to the building trade operatives, but the employers required an undertaking from the unions representing the furniture workers that building trade rates, as such, were not to be recognised in the furniture trade. The unions were prepared to accept the terms if the employers agreed to dismiss all &quot; blacklegs &quot; and pay overtime on a daily basis.Settlements and Agreements.Shipwrights (Southampton). In connection with the demarcation dispute J between shipwrights and joiners employed on ex-Government trawlers, which led to a strike on the 18th August, a demarcation court was appointed, on the 31st August, to inquire into the case, the men agreeing to resume work pending a decision.Railwaymen (Glasgow and South Western Railway). A strike was threatened of mem-bers of the National Union of Railwaymen enployed by the Glasgow and South Western Railway Co. A member of the union obtained employment in the blacksmiths&apos; shop at Kilmarnock in May. On being asked to transfer his membership to the Associated Black-smiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society, he declined, whereupon the members of that union refused to work with him, and, as they persisted in this attitude, he was suspended. The National Union of Railwaymen, alleging that the principle of industrial unionism was at stake, had threatened to call out all members employed by the company on the 6th September unless the man was re-instated by that date. Action was suspended, however, pending a meeting of the directors on the following day. The directors decided to reinstate the man. should he present himself.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Department&apos;s section of the Report, pp. 353 to 355.]* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 8, 21st August, p. 266.t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 1, 3rd July, p. 9.t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 9, 28th August, p. 292.

The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 189 for men and of 1,120 for women. All the divisions report increases in the men&apos;s register, except the London and South-Eastern, the South Midlands and Eastern, and the South-Western Divisions, where slight decreases are reported. As regards the women&apos;s register, increases are reported from the London and South-Eastern, the West Midlands, the Yorkshire and East Midlands, the North-Western and the Wales Divisions, the other divisions showing slight decreases.Men&apos;s Employment.General Outloojc. There is no improvement at Aberdeen in the shipbuilding, marine engineering, and allied industries, owing primarily to a scarcity of material, Messrs. W. Beardmore &amp; Co., Ltd., Clydebank, have discharged a number of shipyard and iron workers owing to shortage of work. At Dumbarton considerable unemployment, largely through lack of materials, continues among riveters, holders-on, platers, fitters and turners. At Govan the live register has considerably decreased, but the relations between the platers and their helpers is again very strained. At Greenock considerable numbers, both of skilled and unskilled workers, are still being paid off from the shipyards weekly, and a large number of engineers also remain unemployed. A large number of men from Glasgow have been engaged by the Irvine shipbuilding firms. There is considerable unemployment in the Northern Division owing to the discharges from the yards of Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd.  Ship-repairing work at Hartlepool is very quiet.In the North-Western Division the industrial outlook is somewhat gloomy, owing to trade disputes, rumours of disputes, and a marked depression in most industries. Although this depression was mainly of a normally recurrent nature, it has been greatly accentuated and may be prolonged by the prevalent unrest. On the other hand the building, iron-founding and vehicle trades are exceedingly brisk, and most Exchanges have large unsatisfied demands for skilled labour in these trades.The condition of the cotton industry is unchanged, and depression, more or less marked in the boot and shoe, leather, lace, silk, cotton, jute and motor industries, is the subject of special comment.Shortage of Labour. In London, orders were fairly plentiful for painters and there was not much difficulty in filling them. Towards the end of the week, however, orders almost Ceased and at present there are none open. A number of electricians are signing the register, but there are few orders.  Many general labourers, fitters&apos; mates and
electricians&apos; mates are unemployed. There is still a large shortage of skilled building operatives in the provinces, and the demand for patternmakers, moulders, coremakers, shipwrights and weavers is still unsatisfied.Industrial]pevelopments. At Plymouth a start has been made with ship-breaking, and orders for 52 men for the next two weeks have been received. Chesterfield report that the British Thomson-Houston Co., Ltd., have purchased land from the Chesterfield Corporation for a factory, which, when completed, will employ over 2,000 women and several hundred men. The Allhallows Colliery, Mealsgate, Workington, which has been idle for 10 weeks, has been purchased by the United Steel Co., Ltd. Employment will be found for nearly 300 miners, and it is hoped to double the former output.Labour Reductions. Bristol report that the Co-operative Wholesale Society have acquired the premises of Messrs. Sarson &amp; Co., boot manufacturers, for the purpose of extending their works. This will mean the suspension, for the present, of at least 300 employees. Messrs. Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies, Ltd., Ipswich, who employ about 5,000 workers, have decided on a 25 per cent, reduction of staff. This is due entirely to trade depression. Messrs. S. B. Holliday &amp; Co., Huddersfield, chemical manufacturers, are dismissing a large number of workpeople, chiefly pipe fitters and plumbers&apos; labourers. Reddish report that the engineering trade is slackening off. Messrs. Ruston &amp; Hornsby, Ltd., engineers, are paying off about 40 men in alternate weeks. During the week the Vulcan Motor &amp; Engineering Co., Ltd., Southport, closed down, 1,200 workmen being affected. At Widnes, Messrs. J. H. Dennis &amp; Co., sulphate and copper manufacturers, have discharged about 200 men. Messrs. J. T. Eltringham &amp; Co., Ltd., Willington Quay, shipbuilders, have paid of! about 50 men. The Singer Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Glasgow, are paying off large numbers of workpeople owing to slackness. .Shortage of Material-Bome employers in the ironfounding industry in Walsall are experiencing difficulty in obtaining raw material. a Earlstown report that the mechanical engineering industry is temporarily depressed owing to a lack of material. A shortage of material and castings in the engineering trades at Levershulme is causing a general slackness. Rutherglen report a shortage of shipbuilding material, which is retarding the absorption of labour.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. The depression in a number of industries during the summer has not had the marked effect on the Exchange registers which might have been expected. In many instances, short time is being worked, and discharges on a large scale have not yet taken place. Many of the women claiming unemployment insurance benefit are married, and their industrial availability is limited. The tendency for employers to engage single women is still very marked. Great difficulty is still experienced in placing unskilled factory workers and semi-skilled clerks and shop assistants.Local Reports. The situation in the London and South-Eastern Division remains unchanged. The Exchanges in the industrial areas continue to report rising registers. The Bermondsey Exchange, however, report work is more active in the leather factories ; Ley ton, that the blouse and furnishing trades are reviving ; and Stepney, that the slight improvement in the tailoring trade has been maintained.At Canning Town the soap, rubber and seed crushing factories are on short time, and workers are being discharged. Camberwell state that the tin, food, dress and leather trades are exceptionally slack. King&apos;s Cross report general slackness, and draw attention to the large number of workwomen claiming unemployment insurance benefit, who state that they have not been employed for the last two years.The Gloucester Exchange report that there is no improvement in the state of employ-ment, and workers are still being discharged. The Exchange are arranging to supply hop pickers for Hereford.At Basingstoke employment in the clothing factories is good, but at Stroud the factories in this industry are on short time. Women for glove making are required at Yeovil.The West Midlands Division continue to report slackness in the staple industries, except the pottery trade, which is very active, At Burslem the factories are working full time, and there is a shortage of skilled tile makers, sanitary casters and earthenware placers.
In Birmingham the general slackness of trade has caused a considerable increase in the live register and in claims to unemployment insurance benefit. In Coventry the slackness in the motor and engineering trade is increasing. At Selly Oak, the Dunlop Bubber Co., Ltd., are discharging workers.At Tipton the shortage of male moulders in the ironfounding trade is said to be retarding the absorption of women workers. At Walsall and Wolverhampton the leather industries are depressed, and hollow-ware workers are unemployed at Stourbridge.There is slackness in the wholesale clothing industry at Braintree, in the tailoring trade at Colchester, and in the staple industries in Leicester. Trade continues very slack in the boot and leather trades in Northampton, where short time is also being worked in the blouse and pinafore factories. At Wellingborough also, the boot and shoe industry remains slack, and women are being discharged.At Watford, Messrs. J. Dickinson &amp; Co., Ltd., paper makers, have discharged 100 women during the week. At Bedford the demand for women from Messrs. Peek, Frean &amp; Co., Ltd., has now been satisfied, 110 women having been placed.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, Nottingham, Basford, Beeston, Ilkeston and Long Eaton are affected by the strike in the plain net section of the lace trade. In the textile trade unemployment is reported to be on the decrease, but the trade is far from brisk. The wholesale clothing and leather trades are also said to be depressed. Bradford report more activity in the mills, and little unemployment amongst skilled textile workers, but shirt machinists still find difficulty in getting a full week&apos;s work. At Brighouse there is a local shortage of textile operatives, but the lack of accommodation prevents importation of workers. This is also the case at Hebden Bridge, where a large number of clothing machinists are required, and at Sowerby Bridge and Todmorden, where there is a demand for cotton textile workers.The North-Western Division report depression in the cotton trade in the Burnley and Accrington area with little prospect of immediate recovery. In the Darwen district, &quot;also, the depression in the cotton trade has increased, producing an adverse effect on minor industries. At Blackburn a few more of the cotton mills have restarted, and the trade appears to have improved. At New Mills the towel weaving industry is slack. Never-theless, the demand for weavers and card-room workers throughout the division continues to be in excess of the supply.Slackness in the rubber industry continues at Chorley, Eccles and Preston.In the Northern Division, Willington Quay report a greater readiness on the part of the applicants to enter domestic service. The roperies are slack in this district, and a number of women have been discharged.Aberdeen report that the dressmakers and milliners have resumed work. Provision workers are being discharged on the closing of the herring season, and will be difficult to place in other employment.At Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy a number of workers in the linen industry are being paid off. The jute trade continues slack at Dundee. At Kilmarnock the hosiery factories are quiet, owing to the high prices of raw material. At Irvine, the hosiery trade has been slightly brisker during the week. At Maryport, Glasgow, the confectionery and rubber trades are slack.The Aberystwyth Exchange are asking employers of seasonal workers to advise their helpers to call at the Exchange if they require situations for the winter months.The unsatisfied demand for resident domestics continues throughout all divisions.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. The question of the employment, at local quarries, of men who are unable to earn the minimum wage, was discussed by the Carnarvon Committee. They were informed that such men could be given a permit to accept less than the minimum rate, provided that the approval of the trade union and the employer could be obtained. It was decided that nothing could be done by the committee, and that the determination of a workman&apos;s earning capacity should be a question for the unions and quarry owners concerned.Training.-Croydon recommend that, when employers refuse to adopt the Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme, bona fide apprentices should not be deprived of the Government subsidy, and they suggest that the Ministry should at once meet all obligations which the
Government would have incurred had the employers of such apprentices adopted the Government scheme. The Pembrokeshire Committee have recommended that employers be urged to employ ex-Service men whose apprenticeship has been interrupted through service in H.M. Forces, in preference to other apprentices.Ex-Service Men. Continued activity is being displayed by committees in connection with the National Scheme, and many committees have reported success as the result of their special canvass to induce employers to sign the undertaking. The Carnarvon Committee have requested local members of Parliament to issue appeals to employers resident in their constituency. Falkirk, Perth and Ayr have invoked the aid of the provosts of the Burghs in their areas in submitting the scheme to their respective Councils.Publicity.-T\% Carnarvon Committee have recommended that all posters dealing with matters of general interest should be printed in Welsh, as well as in English, for the benefit of outlying Welsh districts.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION.Payments Made. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending 26th August, show 604 payments to civilian workers, and 132,536 to ex-members of the Forces. The total amount disbursed to date is  22,401,177 to civilian workers and  32,479,298 to ex-members of the Forces.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Payments Made. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit at local offices, during the week ending the 20th August, was 37,994, involving an amount -of  19,080 17s. 9d.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Juvenile Advisory Committees under the Labour Exchanges Act. During the past twelve months 17 new committees have been appointed, for Braintree, Brixton, Grays, Hereford, Inverness, King&apos;s Lynn, Long Eaton and Heanor, Neath, Newark, Retford, Romford, Runcorn, St. Helens, Swindon, Walthamstow, Willesden and Worksop. In addition, committees have been set up for the County of Shropshire, with sub-committees at Oakengates, Oswestry and Shrewsbury, and for the Holland Division of Lincolnshire, with sub-committees at Boston, Crowland, Donington, Holbeach, Long Sutton and Spalding.With the concurrence of the local education authorities, 24 committees who have completed their term of office have been re-appointed for three years. In six of these cases the education authorities have reserved the right to withdraw their representatives, and to adopt schemes under the Education (Choice of Employment) Act.The reconstitution of the 29 Scottish committees, necessitated by the abolition of school boards and the appointment of local education authorities, has been proceeding somewhat slowly. Eleven have, however, been reconstituted, and it is hoped that the remainder will be dealt with in time for an active winter programme to be undertaken.The total number of committees appointed under the Labour Exchanges Act is now 162.  Eight others are still in course of formation.Schemes under the Education (Choice of Employment) Act. New schemes have been approved by the Board of Education for Colne, Croydon, Darlington, Darwen, Eccles, Farnworth, Hampshire, Leicester, Leicestershire, Leyton, Oxfordshire and Pembrokeshire. In all of these areas the Ministry have agreed to co-operate.The total number of schemes approved by the Board of Education is now 98, ten of which, however, are not yet in operation. In addition 19 draft schemes are under consideration by the Board of Education and the Ministry.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also be found on pages 334, 336, 337, 346, 348, 349, 351 and 352.

On the 1st September, 24,391 men were in training, as against 24,099 on the 28th July and 24,095 on the 21st July. On the 1st September there were 20,065 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 28th July and the 21st July being 21,772 and 22,013, respectively.On the 1st September, the number of men. whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 15,613, the totals for the 28th July and the 21st July being 13,812 and 13,430 respectively.In most cases the problem of training facilities is becoming less acute as new factories are brought on to the active list. The work in the divisions is now proceeding fairly smoothly, though the problems of improvers&apos; vacancies, and of finding fresh training openings as the limits of absorption in certain trades are approached,still remain prominent. One Divisional Director is experiencing increasing difficulty in finding suitable trades for a number of the more recent applicants, by reason of their age and high percentage of disability.Laboratory Assistants.-!^ Scotland a scheme for training men as bacteriological and pathological laboratory assistants has been successfully inaugurated, as a result of negotia-tions with various university and infirmary authorities.Hostels. Proposals for a training centre for teachers at Birtley, a hostel and canteen for Kirkdale, Liverpool, a new hostel at Cambridge, canteens at Harlesden and Hornsey, and a hostel at Charles Street, Cardiff, have been submitted. For the time being, the proposal to institute a hostel at Bristol is in abeyance. The total number of hostel schemes, in process of organisation or actually at work, is 44.Government Instructional Factories. On the 14th August, three factories, Forbesfield, Aberdeen, City Hall, Manchester, and Cricklewood, had over 400 men in training, Aberdeen leading with 458. In four factories, Birtley, Cardiff, Loughborough, and Garrison Lane, the number of men under instruction was over 300, Birtley standing first with 364.The elementary teachers&apos; training section at Sarisbury Court has opened with over 140 men, and there are now approximately 300 men under instruction at this factory. At Chiswick, also, there has been a rapid rise in numbers during the past fortnight, and the total is now 230.On the 14th August the number of men in training in Government Factories&apos;for various branches of the building trades had reached a total of 1,476. There were also 852 men training in mechanical engineering processes, 760 in the tailoring trades and the same number in the furniture trades, 338 as electrical engineers, and 311 as vehicle builders.
Ex-Service Men-continued. Treasury Sanctions.The following are among the more important of a number of proposals that have received Treasury sanction since the issue of the last Report :-The grant to single men, living away from home in lodgings, of the special lodging allowance of 5s. per week, irrespective of whether they were or were not, prior to training, living away from home.Expenditure upon adaptations to the Government Instructional Factory, Wimbledon.Payment of the necessary travelling expenses of trainees sent to interview employers with a view to obtaining improvers&apos; vacancies.Schemes Sanctioned.During the week 16 schemes, providing 252 places, have been sanctioned. Included in this number are 70 places for training in various branches of the building trade.Local Technical Advisory Committees.Furniture-Uhe secretary of the National Trade Advisory Committee attended the inaugural meeting of the Local Technical Advisory Committee, Portsmouth, on the 31st August. It was decided that the probationary period of training should be spent at Sarisbury Court. In consideration of the number of men to be trained and absorbed in the industry, and in view of the shortage of labour for upholstery work in H.M. Dockyard, it was unanimously resolved that the Admiral Superintendent should be asked to nominate a representative on the committee.WOMEN&apos;S TRAINING.General.Courses Available. Reports from the Employment Department and elsewhere indicate that it would be unwise to undertake further industrial training, except in special cases, owing to the great difficulty in placing experienced workers. In certain industries, such as silver buffing and burnishing, linen and damask weaving, and hosiery manufacture, there is a shortage of trained workers, hut training can only be efficiently given in employers&apos; works and this can no longer be sanctioned.New courses can therefore be opened only for domestic and allied, work. The Local Employment Committees and Women&apos;s Sub-Committees have been notified that the department are prepared to arrange courses in these subjects in any area where the com-mittees can guarantee that at feast 15 eligible trainees will be forthcoming, or to arrange for individual training as nursery nurses where applicants are willing, if necessary, to live in an institution. This latter form of training has been particularly successful. The trainees have been very carefully chosen, and are able to secure high wages, both in private households and in institutions. The secretary and the committee of the Newcastle Nursery Training Centre had considered six months the minimum period for adequate training but, since examining the progress of the Ministry of Labour trainees who have recently completed their course, they now agree that 20 weeks is sufficient, if the trainees are carefully selected.Silver Buffing and Burnishing (Sheffield). This scheme has provided an excellent opening for unemployed women of the industrial class in Sheffield. The trade is still very-short of workers, and a considerable number of additional trainees might have been placed could the scheme have been extended. Those trained as buffers have been able, on the completion of training, to earn considerably more than the maintenance allowance. This is also the case with burnishers, except those engaged upon Britannia metal burnishing, for whom six months training was not sufficient to enable them to earn more than 12s. to 16s. per week at first.  In only one case, however, has a trainee left on this account.Training in Employers&apos; Premises (London). Inquiries in the London area as to the position of the women who. have been trained in employers&apos; premises, showed that 51 out of 58 dressmaking trainees were still employed by the firms with whom they had trained. In the underclothing trade only 29 out of 64 had been retained, the others having left, or been discharged, owing to the depression in the wholesale trade. It appears, therefore, that in the dressmaking trade, generally, the system of intensive instruction in a workroom,
Women&apos;s Training-continued.under the supervision of a forewoman or skilled worker, compares very favourably with the system of apprenticeship, under which the apprentice performs many unskilled duties. The adaptability of the trainees soon overcame any difficulty with forewomen and assistants who were at first inclined to resent giving help to the trainees, as they themselves had. had to serve a long apprenticeship and often to pay a premium.War Widows and Dependants.During the four weeks ending the 28th August, 467 applications were received, bringing the total to 2,960. In 47 cases training was authorised, bringing the total to 1,446. Eighty applications were rejected or withdrawn, and there were two withdrawals from training. In 32 cases training was completed. On the 28th August there were 339 war widows in training, 92 awaiting training, and 698 who had completed training. The advertisement of a closing date has produced a large number of applications, and 476 cases are awaiting decision.Since the transfer of training powers to the Ministry, on the 1st September, 1919, 1,724 applications from war widows have been received. During the same period 719 have been sanctioned, and 854 have been rejected or withdrawn.APPRENTICES AND BOYS.INTERRUPTED APPRENTICESHIPS.Questions Affecting the Scheme.Wages. An apprentice dental mechanic at Sheffield complains that the wages to which he is entitled, 45s. per week, are inadequate, as he is a married man. His employer has been approached to increase them as a privilege but so far without success.The Scheme in Operation.Statistics. Up to the 1st September, 41 schemes had been approved, and applications had been received in respect of all of them. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 23rd August, was 187, making a total of 43,356. The number of applications received from apprentices was 209, making a total of 48,682.Up to the 1st September, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 41,802 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 40,146 apprentices, employed by 15,985 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 9,620.Applications.-An apprentice, who signed on for a further period of service with the colours, and has still two years to complete before demobilisation, wishes to make application at once, as he is anxious to come under the scheme eventually, and fears that in two years time it may have ended.Acceptance or N on-Acceptance. Several cases of refusal to accept apprentices, some of them on the part of important firms, are reported. Great objection is being shown to the scheme by Messrs. Burleigh, Ltd., Bristol; continuous complaints have been received from the apprentices and their parents.   The matter is being taken up.The department understand that, following upon the decision of Lord Hunter, the Edinburgh master plumbers have agreed to adopt the scheme, and arrangements are being made accordingly to expedite dealing with applications.At Swansea, an. apprentice, on the dissolution of partnership by the firm employing him has accepted a partnership in a new firm. His renewed apprenticeship has not yet expired, and the possibility of his transfer to the new firm has been mooted. It is held that, although he may be financially interested as a partner, there is no reason why his training should not be continued under the scheme.Training in Operations. Progress.-Local headquarters for the Wales area report the transfer of several apprentices to other firms, to enable them to bbtain better training. In this area there appears to be no difficulty in securing transfers in the building and tailoring trades. .
Apprentices and Boys-Continued.Termination of Agreements. The reason of the cancellation of an agreement between an apprentice and his employer, Mr. W. H. Bird, Stoke-on-Trent, was that the apprentice was very unsatisfactory and, during the last few weeks of his employment, lost on an average three days&apos; work a week. The time lost was spent at race meetings, and the employer dismissed him.Messrs. Gallaway &amp; Sykes, Aberdeen, cabinet makers, have refused, up to the present, to reinstate under the scheme an apprentice, who, owing to a recurrence of ill-health caused by wounds, was unable for some months to follow his employment.GENERAL TRAINING.Apprenticeship: Printing Trade (Sheffield).-^ Sheffield Master Printers&apos; Association have under consideration a scheme for the betterment of apprentices in their industry. Amongst the proposals under consideration are the shortening of the period of apprentice-ship ; endorsement of indentures yearly with a record of the apprenticed educational progress ; attendance during the first three years, at least twice weekly, at suitable classes in connection with the School of Art, all fees to be paid by the employer, provided the apprentice makes 75 per cent, of the possible number of attendances; and the time spent at evening classes to be paid for at day rates. It is further proposed to appoint special apprenticeship sub-committees, representing the three branches of the trade, to ensure the satisfactory working of the scheme. These sub-committees are to consist of two representatives each from the employers, the trade unions, and the technical school committee respectively. It is recommended that indentures should be made compulsory, and that a standard form be drawn up, specifying clearly the respective covenants entered into by all the parties. The scheme also provides that the sub-committees should co-operate with the education authorities as regards the arrangement and conduct of the trade classes, which should be regularly visited by a rota of employers.Shortage of Apprentices (North-East Coast). Reports from the Northern area draw attention to the great shortage of apprentice moulders in the Blyth district, the difficulty in obtaining apprentices for pianoforte tuning and repairing in Sunderland, and the difficulty in obtaining apprentices in the watch making and repairing trade in Newcastle.Apprenticeship (Cardiganshirej^Loc&amp;l headquarters call attention to the very low wages paid to apprentices in this area. Garage proprietors in Cardigan, who are asking premiums from apprentices, only offer 3s. a week during the first year, with three annual increases of a shilling. The Cardigan printers are also stated to pay very low wages to their apprentices. It is stated that small firms cannot afford to pay apprentices wages equal to those earned by unskilled labour, and that local trades such as cabinet making are dying out as a result of competition from the big factories. The urgent need for more technical schools in the district is also emphasised.[Reference to matters of interest to the Training Department will also be found on pages 335, 336, 337, 342, 348, 349 and 351.]INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: NEGOTIATIONS.Trade Joint Councils. A meeting of the trade union side of the Trade Joint Councils Sub-Committee was held on the 1st September, when claims for representation from various unions were considered. It was provisionally agreed that the first meetings of the Councils should be held during the second week in October.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: REPORTS.Industrial.Building. The amended Government proposals for accelerating construction were discussed at a meeting of the Resettlement Committee on the 3rd September, when the secretary submitted a draft reply, which was passed. The committee were unable to agree that the number of apprentices to be allowed during the first year should be double that provided for by existing&apos; regulations, without considerable qualification. They thought that any augmentation should take into account the variations in the regulations
in the different trades governing the proportion of apprentices, and to the requirements of each trade for an increased supply of labour. They pointed out that in bricklaying no restrictions were placed on the employment of apprentices, and that, since the number employed is negligible, there would appear to be room for a great increase without any alteration of current rules. They propose to place in the hands of the unions the task of preparing the rank and file for the necessary degree of augmentation.The committee have agreed, generally, to the Government^ proposal with regard to the rate at which adult apprentices should be started, but adhere to their recommendation that the younger category of apprentices, apart from ex-Service men, should be paid in accordance with the original proposal. Safeguards for employers engaging apprentices under the scheme are provided, the more important being a proposal to transfer adult apprentices from one employer to another where required by the exigencies of the particular employees business. It is agreed that housing should have the first call on labour, and that this end can best be obtained by the distribution of contracts, the full application of which principle would automatically create a form of prohibition on other than housing work.With regard to increasing output, the committee have taken the line that greater output would result from augmentation of labour on the above lines, since a better spirit prevails on jobs on which a full complement of workmen is employed. Some payment in respect of time lost through stress of weather would attract back to the industry numbers of men who have migrated to other occupations, and further improve the moral and the productive capacity of the trade. Suggestions are made as to the method of applying any scheme of payment for wet time. The memorandum has been submitted to the Cabinet Committee, from whom a further reply is expected.Glass. The Home Office Departmental Committee, appointed to consider a possible amendment of the Factory Act in favour of two day-shifts for women and young persons, heard evidence from the English and Scottish Glass Bottle Manufacturers&apos; Association on the 31st August. Evidence from other constituent associations has been invited and will probably be given when the committee meet again in October.Electricity Supply.-rThe District Council for the South Coast Area, Sussex, Hamp-shire and Dorset, met on the 30th August. It was agreed that the Ministry of Transport should be requested, when they give to any undertaking in the area powers to increase statutory charges, to inform the District Council of the fact.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  The District Council for Essex, Middlesex and Hertfordshire met on the 3rd September. It was resolved that the executive committee at once prepare a scheme for the grading of the area.Printing.-T!he employers met on the 31st August at Manchester, and decided to tender lock-out notices to the whole membership of the Typographical Association on the 4th September, unless normal working conditions had been resumed in Manchester by the 3rd September. The executive of the Typographical Association met on the 2nd, and decided to deprive Manchester and Liverpool members of all benefits until they obeyed instructions.The Council met again on the 3rd September, when the proposed action of the employers was discussed. After intricate negotiations, in the course of which Sir David Shackleton was consulted by representatives of both sides, the Council passed a resolution recommending the withholding of week-end notices pending the answer of the Typo-graphical Association Council on the 6th September, and that, on receipt of this reply, the Council of the Federation of Master Printers be asked to reconsider the whole position with a view to keeping the dispute local to Manchester and Liverpool. A second resolution recommended the Typographical Association again to consider carefully the question submitted to them by the employers, and to give a definite reply with regard to work to be produced in otherlueas, and alsowthat disciplinary measures should be taken. Mr. Holmes, for the workers&apos; panel, agreed to issue a manifesto stating their view of the issue, and urging the Manchester operatives to resume work.It was arranged that the Council of the Federation of Master Printers and the. news-paper societies should meet on the 6th September, to discuss the reply of the Typographical Association to their questions, and that the Council should then meet to discuss the attitude proposed by the employers&apos; council.Quarrying.-k meeting of the Executive Committee was held on the 30th August and the quarterly meeting of the National Council on the following day.  The principal
matters discussed were certain applications for membership, further organisation, trans-port facilities, relations with the Mines Department of the Home Office, the new Mining Industry; Act, certain recent disputes, arbitration machinery and education. It was decided that it was desirable to amend the Mining Industry Act so as to separate the quarrying industry and metalliferous mining from the coal mining industry ; and that arbitration under the scheme adopted by the Council should be made optional. Education is to be further discussed by the Executive Committee at their next meeting in October, when it is hoped that the Board of Education liaison officer will attend. Meanwhile, draft educational schemes are to be prepared by the various sections.Tin Mining. A meeting of the Council was held at Camborne on the 27th August.*Tramways. The Standing Committee, on the 31st August, considered a number of applications for interpretations of the agreement of March, 1919.Waterworks UndertaJcings.-T&quot;he Home Counties District Council, on the 23rd August, considered further the decisions of the National Council of the 23rd July on the joint reference made on the 14th June by the District Council as to minimum rates of certain classes of workmen. The decisions of the Council were adopted in certain cases, and agreement was reached upon the others. The District Council for South Wales and Monmouthshire met on the 31st August. An application from the trade union side for an advance of 3d. per hour from the 1st May to the 4th July, and a further 3d. per hour from the 4th July, was considered. It was agreed that an advance of 2d. per hour, as from the first pay-day following the 1st May, be recommended, to apply to permanent employees.Non-Industrial.&quot; Local Authorities&apos; Administrative,Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales).  The Executive Committee met on the 1st September. The areas of District Councils were decided upon, and arrangements for conferences to form District Councils were made. The Salaries and Scales Committee met on the same date to consider suggested salary scales for male and female sanitary inspectors.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : WORKS COMMITTEES.   ,Bobbin and Shuttle.-Dmmg the week representatives of the managements at Messrs.

In Scotland the managements of Messrs. D. Lockhart &amp; Sons, Pollokshaws, Messrs. J. M. Craig, Kilmarnock, and Messrs. R. Brown &amp; Sons, Ltd., Paisley, have been interviewed, and the formation of works committees is now under consideration. At the works of Messrs. Cochran and Fleming, Glasgow, the management have decided to form a works committee as soon as the reconstruction of the firm is completed.In the Staffordshire district a meeting of the employees of Messrs. Gr. Wade &amp; Co., Burslem, was addressed, and unanimously adopted a proposal to form a works committee. A meeting of delegates from the Victoria Works of Messrs. Cartright &amp; Edwards, Longton, was addressed, and arrangements made to form a provisional committee to draft a con-stitution. At the Borough Works of the same firm, a meeting of managers and work-people was attended, and it was decided to proceed forthwith with the election of representa-tives for the works committee. A meeting of the provisional committee formed at the works of the British Anchor Pottery Co., Longton, was attended, and a draft constitution
TRADE BOARDS DIVISION.PROCEEDINGS OF TRADE BOARDS.Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board (Great Britain). The Special Rates Committee considered the question of minimum rates for special classes of female workers, and piece-work basis time-rates for male workers.
