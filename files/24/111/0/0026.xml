!o t^e property of    [i.t.I V     , /7 &quot;o&apos;:i.nent.----- -- . . I UMH^Ipt^ary Secret. 1424F?&apos;07??. Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,2nd September 1920,11531. 1st September. Reference para. 5 of our serial No. 208, dated 20th August. Further developments were reported to you in Foreign and Political telegrams No. 1053 S. of 30th and 1057 S. of 31st. The display of military force in the Cis-frontier district in support of civil power has had considerable effect, and internal situation is reported greatly improved. Excitement has, however, spread to Trans-Frontier Black Mountain tribes, who might possibly muster 7,000 rifles. Tribesmen estimated 1,000 attacked military camp Oghi night of 29th-30th, and are reported to have suffered considerable casualties, while our casualties were nil. Enemy has burnt Panja Gali, Jalla Gali and two other small frontier constabulary posts on Black Mountain, and taken 50 rifles. Officer Commanding, Oghi, reports hostile gathering dispersed by gun-fire evening of 30th, but on the morning of 31st enemy was occupying hills near camp. General Officer Commanding, Northern Command, has visited area, and is acting in close touch with Civil Chief Commissioner. Although precautions are being taken to meet possible eventualities, civil authorities hope to bring tribes to reason without the necessity of embarking on military operations beyond border. It is possible, if unrest spreads, it may interfere with relief of 1/llth Rajputs in Chitral by 3/39th Garhwal Rifles from India as column escorting relieving unit is due to leave Nowshera on 15th September. Relief of former unit is very necessary as it Jias already been two years in Chitral. You will be kept fully informed regarding any further development.
