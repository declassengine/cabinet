PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.Attention has been concentrated during the week upon the coal situation. Details of the interview between the President of the Board of Trade and the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain on the 9th September, are given below. Since that meeting, no further communications have taken place between the two parties, but on the trade union side a meeting of the sub-committee of the Triple Alliance (consisting of the presidents and the secretaries of the constituent bodies) took place on the 14th September, and a meeting of the miners&apos; executive on the 15th. As a result of the latter meeting an arrangement has been made for a further meeting between the miners&apos; executive and thet President of the Board of Trade on the 16th. A national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation has been summoned for the 21st September.The continuous interest of the other two members of the Triple Alliance in the progress of the miners&apos; negotiations results partly from the severe unemploy-ment which a miners&apos; strike would cause among the railwaymen and various groups of transport workers, and also from the questions of trade union policy sym-pathetic action, the handling of coal during a strike, and similar matters which would immediately arise on the strike becoming operative, and which would give trouble particularly to the railwaymen. No steps have yet been taken to call a full meeting of the Triple Alliance, but the executive of the National Union of Railwaymen have advised branches to take steps to instruct their general meeting delegates; and, should it appear in the forthcoming week that a strike is inevitable, a special delegate meeting will probably be held. One particular section of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation is in-interested in the question of a coal strike from another point of view. Since the beginning of June, the commercial road transport workers have had wages demands before their employers, upon which the employers have refused to negotiate. In some quarters it is expected that the coal strike might put these workers in a key position, and enable them to secure the wages concessions they desire.The cotton textile industry is also waiting upon the issue, and the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations have postponed for a fortnight the consideration of the introduction of organised short time as a means of curtailing production in view of the present slackness in the trade.As a result of recommendations adopted by a meeting on the 15th September of the Joint Industrial Council for the Electricity Supply Industry, following on an intimation by the Electrical Trades Union that they were prepared to withdraw the question of principle involved in the Penistone dispute, the position is now more hopeful with regard both to the lock-out of Electrical Trades Union members, and the threatened sympathetic action in London and the provinces.*The Trades Union Congress concluded on the 11th September. An account of the proceedings of the last three days is given below. The proceedings of the Congress as a whole are in marked contrast to those of the Glasgow Congress held last year. This may be attributed partly to the fact that a number of difficult and controversial -questions, such as the nationalisation of the mines, the situation in Ireland and Russia, had already been discussed at special meetings of the Congress during the year. It may also be ascribed in part to the industrial situation last week, which diverted interest from the Congress to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. It is important to observe that the Congress ended without the adoption of any specific resolutions with regard to the course which trade unions should adopt as regards the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Act.The operation of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act is attracting greater interest in Scotland and Wales than in England. The resolution of the Trades Union Congress on this subject met with fairly strong opposition, and was passed on a division in which only two-thirds of the possible votes&apos;were recorded.* This dispute was settled on the 16th September, and full details of the settlement will appear in next week&apos;s issue.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Labour and Ireland.-J)vimig the week interest has chiefly centred on the&apos; condition of the Lord Mayor of Cork. The Trades Union Congress despatched two telegrams to the Prime Minister demanding Mr. MacSwiney&apos;s release, but the suggestion of some of the delegates that &quot; direct action &quot; should be threatened were repudiated by Mr. Thomas, who pointed out the full implications of such a step, and deprecated irresponsible proposals of any kind.It is reported that the situation in Belfast shows little sign of improvement. A number of textile and other factories have re-opened, but the position in the shipyards remains unchanged.The movement in Ireland in favour of secession from English trade unions is apparently developing. Dockers in the Cork area have transferred from the Dock, Wharf, Eiverside and General Workers&apos; Union to an Irish union organised on &quot; national grounds,&quot; and the Dublin branch of the Irish Society of Vehicle Builders have decided to join the Irish Engineering Union, which was formed some time ago as a nucleus of a general engineering union for Ireland, which would be independent of unions with headquarters in Great Britain.The Cost of Living. -The joint committee to investigate the increased cost of living, appointed last June by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Co-operative Union*, issued an interim report on the 8th September for presentation to the Trades Union Congress. The committee found that the high cost of living may be primarily assigned to currency expansion, and not to under-pro-duction, and that the chief remedy would therefore be to deal with the inflation of currency in this and other countries, and to deflate it, where possible, to an extent which would eliminate the depreciation of currency in terms of gold. The report maintains that such measures would involve a reduction of prices by about 20 per cent., and, at the same time, would cut at the root of the automatic rise of prices due to currency influences. On the other hand, a steady improvement of productivity, through the participation of all countries in the trade of the world, the improvement of methods and machinery, and a far-reaching re-organisation of industry, is necessary to prevent the widespread unem-ployment and general fall in wages which would inevitably accompany an attempt to reduce prices by the method proposed. The report goes on to advocate that the present index numbers of the cost of living should &quot; be superseded by new index numbers, based upon the prices prevailing since the armistice &quot; ; and it details the measures which should be adopted to deal with the problem of high prices. With regard to the international aspect of the question, the view is put forward that the re-establishment of peace throughout the world is the first essential for a fall in prices. The report also recommends that, until the machinery of exchange is re-established, the import and export of goods between different countries should be conducted, where other methods are not possible, by means of direct barter, and that an international loan should be floated by the League of Nations to assist impoverished countries in the restoration of their productive capacity.See this Report, No. 22, 26th June, p. 759.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 3rd September was 146,451, made up of 145,874 lodged by men and 577 by women. On the 27th August there were 143,186 policies current, 142,600 for men and 586 for women.On the 3rd September, 86,960 unemployment books, 59,668 for males and 27,292 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Compared with the previous week, when there were 56,977 books lodged by males and 25,429 by females, the total increase is 4,554.The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 364.
* Details of.the scheme were given in this Report, Vol. II, No. 2,10th July, p. U.Increase of Bent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. It is reported, that the Scottish co-operative societies have endeavoured to arrive at a common policy on the question of increasing the rents of houses which they own. While a number of societies have been taking advantage of the provisions of the Act to impose increases, others, in sympathy with the agitation against the Act, are maintaining the old rates. A con-ference was held on the 4th September, in Glasgow, but no result was achieved, the delegates deciding that, owing to differing financial circumstances, it would be better to - allow individual societies to continue to make their own arrangements.The question of calling a rent strike throughout the South Wales coalfield was dis-cussed at a special conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation on the 14th September. The executive recommended that, as all workers in all industries are affected by this question, action should not be taken sectionally, but only in conjunction with the whole Labour movement.  This recommendation was adopted after some discussion.Engineering Industry. The question of technical training in the engineering industry in England and Scotland has been under consideration during the last fortnight. In England, it has now been decided that the work of the Engineering Training Organisation can no longer be carried on independently, owing to the lack of support from the leading engineering manufacturers, and steps are being taken to hand over this work either to the Federation of British Industries or to the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations. The organisation was formed in October, 1917, under the auspices of the Institutions of Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineers, with the assistance of a few leading firms. Its aim was the co-ordination of engineering training, including the promotion of apprenticeship as a national institution, and the provision of scholarships to enable promising youths to pursue courses of technical training.In Scotland, the report has just been issued of a committee appointed last year by the Council of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders to investigate the question of engineering training. This report contains recommendations with regard to apprentice-ship and workshop training in connection with the continuation classes established by the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918. &apos; It also advises employers to make fuller use of the Juvenile Advisory Committees connected with the Employment Exchanges when engaging apprentices.Industrial and Other Organisations.Trades Union Congress. Last week&apos;s Eeport contained an account of the proceedings of the Trades Union Congress up to the close of the session of the 8th September. On the 9th, the principal business was a debate on the proposal to set up a General Council of Labour in place of the existing Parliamentary Committee. Mr. Harry Gosling, who has been mainly concerned with the promotion of the scheme,* moved a resolution adopting the scheme, which was seconded by Mr. Robert Williams. Mr. dynes spoke strongly in opposition, contending that the proposed Council would be merely an enlarged Parliamentary Committee, and could not, as it stood, have the effect of co-ordinating the trade union movement and consolidating its executive power. Mr. Cramp also opposed the resolution, on the ground that the scheme gave no guarantee that the new organisation would not become as bureaucratic as the old, and ultimately prove less effective than a &quot; scratch &quot; organisation elected at a time of emergency. On a card vote the scheme . was adopted py 4,858,000 to 1,767,000 votes.A resolution on unemployment, declaring that responsibility for unemployment should be borne by the industry concerned, was adopted on the motion of Mr. Tom Mann. A further resolution pledged the Parliamentary Committee to support the inclusion of seamen in the Hours of Employment Bill, and another urged the necessity of improved accommodation for seamen.In connection with the General Council, a delegate proposed, at the beginning of the session of the 10th September, that the Standing Orders should be suspended while a proposal for the immediate establishment of the Council was discussed. As matters stand, the body will not operate for another year, and in view of the gravity of the industrial situation it was desired to create at once a strong central organisation. The proposal was not accepted. The industrial situation occupied a considerable portion of this day&apos;s sitting,, the lock-out of the members of the Electrical Trades Urn on from the engineering workshops being discussed at length, upon a motion condemning the attitude
of the employers in refusing to withdraw the lock-out notices. Further resolutions called for the better co-ordination of the work of Trade Boards, the reversal of the recent Admiralty order affecting the political activities of dockyard employees, and the inclusion in the amended Mines Bill of the principle of State employment of colliery deputies. An emergency resolution on the subject of Ireland, instructing the Parliamentary Committee to call together the executives of the various trade unions affected by the disturbances in Belfast, with a view to taking combined action to enforce the reinstatement of all expelled trade unionists, was submitted by the Standing Orders Committee and carried unanimously. A motion proposing that in future the British trade union movement be affiliated to the International Federation of Trade Unions only through the Trades Union Congress, and their Parliamentary Committee, aroused much feeling; and the attitude of Mr. W. A. Appleton towards Labour was strongly criticised by several delegates. The resolution was carried with a few dissentients.The proceedings closed on the 11th September with the election of the new Parlia-mentary Committee, which is composed as follows : Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P. (National Union of Eailwaymen); Mr. J. W. Ogden (Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association); Mr. J. Hill (United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Ship Builders); Mr. H. Gosling (Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen); Miss M. Bondfield (National Federation of Women Workers); Mr. R. Smillie (Miners&apos; Federation); Mr. R. B. Walker (Union of Agricultural Workers); Mr. A. B. Swales (Amalgamated Engineering Union); Mr. A. A. Purcell (National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association);. Mr. W. Thorne, M.P. (National Union of General Workers); Mr. J. Sexton, M.P. (National Union of Dock and Riverside, and General Workers); Mr. A. Smith (United Vehicle Workers) ; Mr. A. Pugh (Iron and Steel Trades Confederation); Mr. (H. Boothman (Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners); Mr. E. L. Poulton (National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives); and Mr. J. Beard (Workers&apos; Union).Mr. Smillie again referred to the alleged &quot; bartering &quot; for votes in connection with the election of the Parliamentary Committee, and moved that a special committee be appointed to investigate the matter. The resolution was carried unanimously, and the following delegates were appointed to act on the committee, who will begin their inquiry directly : Mr. J. Bromley, of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen; Mr. C. T. Cramp, of the National Union of Railwaymen ; Mr. Robert Williams, of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation; Mr. George Hicks, of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society; and Mr. Herbert Smith, of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association. Pending the result of the inquiry, the old Parliamentary Committee will continue in office.Women&apos;s Trade Union League. The annual conference of the League was held at Portsmouth on the 7th September. Miss Gertrude Tuckwell presided, and the meeting was addressed by Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., and Mr. Ben Turner. The League, which is affiliated to the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations, has as its chief object the promotion of trade unionism among women, and acts as a federation to which unions specifically catering for women workers can affiliate. The 45th annual report, presented to the conference, announced an advance in the organisation of women and an increased number of affiliated societies.Municipal Employees&apos; Association. The annual conference of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association was opened at Newcastle&apos; on the 13th September, some 250 delegates being present. Mr. Ben Forster, of Bury, in his presidential address, criticised employers for obstructing the smooth running of Whitley Councils and complained of the expenses incurred by the trade unions in connection with them. M. Van Hinte, president of the Butch Union of Workers in Public Services, representing the International Federation of Public Workers, conveyed greetings to the conference. On the 14th September an increase in contributions for the purpose of doubling strike pay was agreed to.The Labour Party. The Labour Party executive have appointed Mr. Arthur Greenwood as secretary to the Party&apos;s Advisory Committees.Trade Union Topics.Amalgamated&apos; Engineering Union. It is announced that Mr. Tom. Mann, the general secretary of the union, will resign his position next April, as he will then have reached the age of 65, the limit permitted by the rules of the society. The executive committee have therefore decided that branches should be requested to send in nominations for the position.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Goal Miners (National). The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain met Sir Eobert Home on the 9th September. Concerning the miners&apos; demand for a reduc-tion in the price of domestic coal, Sir Robert maintained the Government^ position that this was a question of policy which concerned the community as a whole, and which could not be a matter of negotiation with the Federation. On the wages demand he made two suggestions, the first, that the matter should be referred to the Industrial Court, and the second, that representatives of the miners and the owners should meet together and endeavour to remove the wage anomalies due to flat rate increases having been given upon the original tonnage rate, and arrive at a method of payment based on output. Mr. Robert Smillie maintained that the miners were entitled to a voice on the price of coal and re-stated their case for increased wages. He did not think that the miners were prepared to bring their wages claim before the Industrial Court, and said that, if the miners had not been asking for a reduction in the price of domestic coal, their wages claim would have been for at least 4s. per day increase. He did not think that the miners&apos; executive would be averse from merging into one common base rate the various increases in wages,Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society. Proposals for a working agree-ment between this society and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain are under consideration. &apos; A draft agreement has been prepared by the colliery delegate of the society, providing for joint action with the miners in industrial matters, and stating that the society are prepared to pay an affiliation fee to the Federation, if members of the society will be included in any applications for increased wages or improved conditions put forward by the Federation.Variety Artistes&apos; Federation. A cinema section of the Federation has been formed for the benefit and protection of cinema artistes. At a meeting held in London on the 12th September, the decision to form such a section was taken, and a resolution passed declaring its aims to be a universal form of contract; limitation of working hours per day ; extra payment for overtime work ; special rates of pay for all Sunday work ; improved dressing-room accommodation; a fair day&apos;s pay for a fair day&apos;s work ; adjustment bf agents&apos; commission ; and limitation of &quot; bogus &quot; cinema schools.Ex-Service Men.Amalgamation of Ex-Service Organisations. The draft constitution for the proposed new body which will be set up on the amalgamation of ex-Service organisations has been agreed upon, and will be considered at a further conference of the organisations concerned on the 18th September^Employment of Ex-Service Men. The conference of Mayors and chairmen of local authorities in London and the Home Counties, summoned by the Lord Mayor of London, was held at the Mansion House on the 8th September. The Minister addressed the conference.A letter from the Minister appeared in The Times of the 13th September, explaining the necessity of setting up a Standing Joint Committee for Greater London, to deal with the problem of unemployment among ex-Service men within the Metropolitan area, and announcing that the Lord Mayor has called a conference of London Mayors and the Chairmen of the extra-metropolitan Urban District Councils, to be held at the Ministry of Labour on the 17th September.It is announced that no further dismissals of ex-Service temporary civil servants will take place, and that the Substitution Boards and dependent committees recommended by the Lytton Committee will be set up as soon as possible.United Services Fund. It is reported that a sum of  300,000 has been set aside from this Fund, to be employed on a special scheme for the education of children of ex-Service men.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.At the conclusion of the meeting, after the Executive Committee had deliberated in private, Mr. Smillie said that Sir Robert Horne&apos;s statement contained no new proposal which would, in the opinion of the miners&apos; executive, lead to a satisfactory settlement.Tramwaymen [Glasgow). Members of the tramway section of the United Vehicle Workers, employed by the Glasgow Corporation, have voted in favour of a strike for increased wages and for recognition of the union. Up to the present, the Corporation have negotiated with the Municipal Employees&apos; Association with regard to tramwaymen&apos;s wages and conditions of service, and have declined to recognise the United Vehicle Workers on the ground that it would be inadvisable to deal with two unions catering for the same class of worker. Wages applications on behalf of the tramwaymen have been submitted by both unions. The Corporation have adjourned discussion of the subject, in order that a fuller statement might be placed before them as to the membership claimed by each society among the tramway workers.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Taxi-cab Drivers (London).-A small number of taxi-cab drivers failed to take out their cabs on the 9th September owing to their refusal to pay the \d. per mile demanded by the owners as a contribution towards the increased cost of petrol. At a mass meeting of drivers on the 12th September, it was decided to open negotiations with the owners on the subject; no drivers were to return to work where the owners insisted on this payment. It is understood that several owners have waived their demand. The drivers maintain that the demand is a violation of the principle that the journeyman driver of a passenger vehicle shall not be called upon to contribute to its maintenance. A meeting between the two parties, on the 14th September, t failed to reach a settlement.Printers (Manchester and Liverpool). On the 13th September, Messrs. A. A. Purcell and E. Poulton, of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, conferred at Manchester with members of the executive council of the Typographical Association and of the Manchester and Liverpool branches, on the question of the present strike. The conference adjourned until the 16th September, when the full executive of the Typographical Association will be in attendance. It is reported that the newspaper printers in Manchester have decided to send a deputation to the employers, with a suggestion that they shall grant the increase of 10s. per week as from the 28th August. On the instructions of the strike committee this action will not be taken until after the meeting on the 16th September.Settlements and Agreements.Coal Miners (Derbyshire).-Th.Q joint committees set up to investigate the suitability of steel props at the pits of the Butterley Coal and Iron Co., Ltd., have approved their use. In July the miners threatened to strike for the substitution of wooden for steel props, but suspended their notices pending the report of these committees.*Platers&apos; Helpers (Clyde).-On. the 13th and 14th September negotiations took place at the Ministry on the dispute in the Clyde shipyards as to the amount of payment to be made to the helpers by the platers under the Industrial Court award No. 405. It was agreed to submit the matter to the Industrial Court, and the hearing takes place on the 17th September. Pending the decision of the Court, work is to be resumed, and the lock-out notices are to be withdrawn.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Departments section of the Report, pages 376 to 379.]
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies and placings during the week ending the 3rd September: -	Men.

The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 1,294 as regards men, and a decrease of 902 in respect of women.All the divisions report increases in the men&apos;s register, except the Yorkshire and East Midlands, the Northern, the Wales and the Ireland Divisions where slight decreases are reported. As regards the women&apos;s register, increases are reported from the London and South-Eastern, the South Midlands and Eastern, South-Western, West Midlands, North-Western and Scotland Divisions, the other divisions showing slight decreases.Men&apos;s Employment.General Situation-ln shipbuilding and the allied industries, unemployment has increased at Aberdeen and Ayr, the lack of material continuing. At Clydebank the dispute between the platers and their helpers is causing the discharge of large numbers of shipyard workmen. There is still considerable unemployment at Dumbarton. The Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd., Govan, are working short time in their engineering department, employment being given in alternate weeks. The shipyard at Irvine is still very busy, and has a large amount of repair work in hand. The situation on the Tyne and Wear remains practically unchanged; the demand for labour is very small. On the Tees, employment continues fairly good, but slackness in some shipyard departments is attributed to intermittent deliveries of material. Hartlepool report that employment has been fairly good in the shipyards owing to the increase in repair work. At Southampton, Messrs. J. I. Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd., have discharged 200 men engaged on ship-repairing, and Messrs. Day, Summers &amp; Co., Ltd., 200.The North-Western Division report that the outlook is more gloomy than for many months past. The most serious aspect is the widespread uneasiness among employers, in consequence of the threatened coal strike and the numerous other disputes in progress. Some employers have given notice that if a coal strike takes place their works will close down immediately. The engineers&apos; refusal to work overtime on maintenance and repair work is still seriously affecting employment.Employment in the Liverpool district is still very slack. At Birkenhead the men&apos;s live register, already large, has increased by over 500 during the week; at Liverpool and Bootle the increases are 216 and 303.The slackness in the cotton industry appears to have become more acute, and certain districts, which previously have reported the trade as active, now record a falling off in employment. The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations are meeting to consider the introduction of organised short-time working. Nevertheless, many persons with knowledge of the trade state that there are signs of a revival, provided the industrial peace can be kept.There are as yet no indications of a revival in the leather, boot and shoe and lace industries.
Women&apos;s Employment.General Industrial Situation. There is little change to report. The depression in the cotton trade in the North-Western Division tends to spread, although the demand for experienced weavers and other operatives is greater than the supply. The rubber trade continues depressed, and other industries affected are hatting, silk (making-up) and slipper making. In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, short time is being worked in many textile factories. Depression is still reported in the wholesale clothing industry. The rug and rag trades are also slack. In the lace, the making-up and the hosiery industries, the depression is also very severe. No improvement is reported in the staple industries of\the South Midlands and Eastern Division. Increasing depression in all the factory areas of London is reported. In the West Midlands Division, the general situation is also unchanged. There is little demand for women&apos;s labour, and metal machinists, rubber workers, leather workers, tailoresses and unskilled factory workers are affected. Fewer vacancies have been notified in the pottery industry owing to the possibility of a coal strike. In Scotland, the slackness in the jute trade continues, but some improvement is reported in the hosiery industry, and there are indications that the linen trade may revive shortly.        .Reports regarding the general engineering industry vary considerably. At Gains-borough, trade is stated never to have been better; the local firms could absorb more men but for the continued shortage of moulders. At Southport, the Vulcan Motor and Engineering Co., Ltd., have been able to reinstate about 1,000 of the 1,200 employees discharged a week ago. The Singer Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Clydebank, are paying men off at the rate of 1,000 a week owing to dull trade. Discharges by Messrs. Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies, Ltd., Ipswich, amounted to nearly 200 in the week. Messrs. Gwynnes, Ltd., Chiswick, have discharged a further 250 workpeople owing to slackness. Messrs. J. &amp; E. Hall, Ltd., Dartford, have put off 150 men, and are discharging many more in the near future.During the week considerable numbers of men have found work in consequence of preparations for the fishing season.Industrial Developments. At Brixton, the Telephone Manufacturing Co., Ltd., are making alterations in their premises which, they expect, will allow of their employing 150 more workpeople. The United Alkali Co., Ltd., Widnes, have decided to reopen two of their disused plants for the manufacture of bleach. Wrexham report that Messrs. Powell Bros., Ltd., expect to start, in about three months, the manufacture, on a large scale, of motor cycles of a new pattern.Labour Reductions. In addition to the discharges indicated above, notice has been given to 50 men at the Ediswan Cable Works, and to 40 men by the London Foundry Co., Ltd., Brimsdown, as a result, it is understood, of the cancellation or suspension of contracts owing to the lock-out in the electrical trades. At Leven, over 100 workmen, mostly labourers, have been paid off by the National Steel Foundry (1914), Ltd.Shortage of Labour.-Fh.e situation in the building trades remains unchanged in London, except that the demand for painters is slackening to some extent. In the provinces the shortage of skilled labour continues in all districts where any considerable building schemes are in progress.There is still an unsatisfied demand for moulders of all types, shipwrights, coach builders and repairers, wheelwrights, fireclay goods makers, earthenware casters, wood turners and tinplate millmen.Shortage of Material. In Dudley, shortage of material is making the bedstead, fender and fire-iron industry very quiet. Some ironfounders in Walsall are experiencing difficulty in obtaining raw material. Lack of material and fuel still prevent employers in Darlington engaging men. A great amount of work is being held up in Bristol owing to the lack of cement, steel and other materials.Miscellaneous.-During the week, work to the value of  300,000 has been transferred from the port of Southampton to Belgium. This action is attributed to the unrest in evidence in Southampton. The flax factories at Yeovil are dismissing ex-Service men and advertising for boys and girls to take their places. The reason given is that juveniles are easier to train, and cheaper. The Littleton Collieries, Ltd., Huntington, state that they could employ another 500 underground workers, but there is no lodging or housing accommodation available.
Local Reports.-As illustrating the position in London it may be noted that Ber-mondsey report that tin box makers and leather stitchers are out of work ; Canning Town, that unemployment continues in the confectionery, jam and preserves and rubber trades. At King&apos;s Cross there are said to be evidences of a continued decline in all industries; at Shoreditch there is acute unemployment amongst French polishers, tin workers, tailoresses, plain machinists and unskilled factory workers. At Woolwich, fresh registrations include many widows discharged from the Dockyard, for whom it is difficult to find employm ent.The rubber and button-making trades are still depressed in Aston, and at Coventry the Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., have discharged about 200 women. At Worcester, women are still being discharged from leather-button factories. Discharges from various factories are continuing in Selly Oak.At Bradford the textile industry is quiet, although there is not yet much apparent unemployment; at Brighouse and Sowerby Bridge, employment is still plentiful, but the lack of housing accommodation prevents workers being brought into the district. At Halifax there is depression in the blouse and underclothing trade. At Keighley and Hebden Bridge, depression in the textile trade is becoming more acute.At Blackburn, where a slight improvement in the cotton industry had been noted, several mills are still closed down, and others are working short time, with a large pro-portion of the weavers without their full complement of looms. There is a shortage of skilled machinists for underclothing work at Crewe, but local applicants only are required. Sailcloth weavers are in demand at Trafford Park, and confectioners at St. Helens. The hatting trade at Rawtenstall and Garston is depressed. At Accrington the women supplied to the new slipper industry by the Exchange are still at work, and another batch will be required shortly.At Irvine the hosiery trade is said to be almost normal. At Kirkcaldy the spinning mills are on short time. At Dunfermline, trade, with the exception of the linen industry, is very good.Domestic Work There is some indication that the industrial slackness, combined with the high cost of living, are inclining workers to view this employment more favourably. At Shepherds Bush, for example, a clerk, two dressmakers and a telephone operator have accepted resident domestic service during the week. At Yeovil, applicants are showing greater willingness to accept resident domestic work. At Cambridge, several resident domestics have been placed in other districts. At Hull and at Earlestown, the attitude towards domestic work is said to be improving. At Bristol, where there is little demand for skilled workers, shop assistants and clerks are accepting poets as nurse probationers and domestic helps, and some have entered for nursery training.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement.-^.^, Bristol Resettlement Sub-Committee have reported on the visit of a deputation, together with officials of the Corporation, to the Development Commission, the Ministry of Health, the Road Board and the Ministry of Labour, with a view to obtaining assistance in starting relief works. The result had been most disappointing, as the deputation had in all cases been referred back to the Minister of Labour, who stated that he had no funds available. The committee considered that the unemployment problem could not be satisfactorily dealt with unless it was taken up by the Ministry of Labour, and resolved to urge the Minister to summon a national conference of Local Employment Committees to place the position before the Prime Minister.Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance. The Worksop Committee consider that the omission of any provision for refunds to employers under the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act will not be in the interests of the Act or of industry generally, as the refund was given to encourage employers to provide permanent employment, and the omission will tend to increase casual labour.Training. The Bradford Committee have received complaints from ex-Service men concerning the inadequacy of their training in motor engineering at the Bradford Technical College, and have appointed a deputation to discuss the matter with the principal of the College.Ex-Service Mew.-The Nottingham Committee have inquired into the discharge of ex-Service men from the Royal Army Ordnance Depot, Chilwell, and decided to request the labour officer at the depot to receive a deputation.   The deputation appointed to

At Watford the question of co-operation between social organisations for domestic servants and the Women&apos;s Sub-Committee, has been under consideration. Three of the four clubs to which a letter had been addressed were willing to co-operate.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION.Payments Made. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 2nd September, show 623 payments to civilian workers, and 143,442 to ex-members of the Forces. The total amount disbursed to date is  22,401,726, to civilian workers and  32,636,256 to ex-members of the Forces.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Payments Made. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit at local offices, during the week ending the 27th August, was 37,700, involving an amount of  19,110 5s. Qd.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 8th September, the number of certificates which had been issued to employers enrolled under the Scheme was 20,093. Their undertakings cover 193,718 disabled men.The Minister has addressed a special appeal to all Lord Mayors, Mayors and Chairmen of Urban District Councils in England and Wales, and to Lord Provosts, Provosts and Chairmen of County Councils in Scotland, asking them to do all in their power to further the Scheme.The Divisional Controller for the North-Western Division reports that a return issued by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, giving the number of disabled men employed by various firms in the Liverpool Cotton Association, indicates that a number of firms who do not appear on the Roll are employing more than the percentage required by the Scheme.All the remaining unemployed disabled men, resident in the Borough of Oldham, have now been placed in employment by the Oldham Corporation.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Juvenile Unemployment. Recent reports from Divisional Controllers indicate a serious state of affairs. Nearly all indicate, as contributory causes, difficulties in procuring raw material and adult labour, and the general feeling of unsettlement. The rates fixed by Trade Boards, and by temporary regulations, are generally held responsible for lack of vacancies in certain trades. Thus the Wales, the Northern and the South-Western Divisions report that employers say they cannot pay the wages required for learners in the dressmaking and millinery trades, and the opinion is expressed in most divisions that, when the wage is fixed according to age, the training of older juveniles is rendered impossible.*The effects of the moulders&apos; strike are still being felt, and local strikes in other trades have reduced the number of vacancies open to juveniles.  Other factors mentioned are

The North-Western and South-Western Divisions are particularly pessimistic. In the Liverpool Exchange area, at the time of the report, there were said to be 950 boys and girls unemployed, exclusive of those registered at the Education Authority&apos;s registry. The Juvenile Employment Committee, who have urged the department to approach the Board of Education with the object of setting up a permanent centre for unemployed juveniles, are making emergency arrangements to deal with the problem in co-operation with the Young Men&apos;s Christian Association and the boys&apos; and girls&apos; clubs.Boot and Shoe Industry. Great difficulty is experienced at Stafford in persuading boys to take up trades in this industry. Lotus, Ltd., are offering facilities in various directions. All boys are eligible to join the firm&apos;s gymnasium and boys&apos; club, and to attend the technical school for theoretical tuition two mornings a week until 17 years of age.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also be found on pages 358 to 360, 369, 370, 372 and 375.]

A public meeting, called by the Lord Mayor of Manchester in response to the King&apos;s letter, was held on the 31st August. As no newspaper reports appeared until the end of the week, its appeal was practically limited to those present, who were not numerous. An appeal embodying the King&apos;s letter to Earl Haig has been sent out to managers of theatres and music halls, with a request that they will allow it to be read to their audiences.The Director at Birmingham reports a considerable increase in fresh registrations. A number of these new applicants have occupied positions with engineering and other firms, their services been dispensed with owing to the slackness of trade, and it is impossible to place them in similar permanent employment elsewhere. A special effort to secure for them temporary employment, during the present emergency, has met with some success.The Controller of the Appointments and Training Branch, Ireland, reports that advantage has been taken of Earl Haig&apos;s appeal to send out letters to the Lords Lieutenant and the Deputy Lieutenants of the Irish Counties. The chairman of the Wholesale Stationery and Printing Trades Association, Ltd., made himself personally responsible for the placing of candidates on the register at Belfast who had previously had experience in that trade.  As a result all have been placed.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments Department will also be found on page 362.]TRAINING DEPARTMENT.EX-SERVICE MEN.General,Statistical-Oil the 8th September, 24,647 men were in training, as against 24,391 on the 1st September and 24,099 on the 28th July. On the 8th September there were 19,749 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 1st September and the 28th July being 20,065 and 21,772 respectively. On the 8th September, the number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 16,091, the totals for the 1st September and the 28th July being 15,613 and 13,812 respectively.
18.9.30.370Ex-Service Men-continued.The increase in the number of men in training is largely owing to the recent influx into Sarisbury Court, including 127 men with whom the elementary teachers&apos; training college started. The reduction in the waiting list is mainly due to drastic revisions in the Essex and East Anglian waiting lists, which more than counterbalance additions in certain other divisions.An analysis of the waiting lists at the end of August, for all divisions except Scotland, shows that 2,250 names were added to the lists during the month, and the number of withdrawals reached 3,311. Nearly half the withdrawals were due to transfer to training centres. About a quarter of the men on the waiting list had been interviewed by Local Technical Advisory Committees, or approved for training in non-special trades.Elementary Teachers.-The Board of Education have approved the schemes for estab-lishing training colleges at Birmingham and Birtley, and a request for financial sanction at an early date is being put forward in order that a start may be made with the necessary staffing arrangements and the adaptation of the premises.Publicity. In the West Midlands Division, an arrangement has been arrived at with the Employment Department officers, whereby work carried out by men in training in the division is shown in the windows of certain Exchanges, together with a notice as to vacancies in the various classes.Building.-ln the East Midlands Division, men who have completed their period of institutional training are being placed out as improvers on the housing scheme at Skegness. A proposal for the employment of trained men on similar lines has been received from the contractors for the housing scheme at Hinckley. Men in training are to work on the adaptations and alterations for the new London Instructional Factory at Carlow Street.Hostels.-Arrangements have now been concluded with the United Services Fund, who will make grants to Instructional Factories for welfare and recreational purposes, and will provide books for the libraries at these institutions. All applications must be made by the Local Welfare Committees, and submitted through headquarters to the United Services Fund.Government Instructional Factories. At Chiswick there are contracts in hand to the value of  476, as well, as work on equipment, and on the factory extension just begun. Everything is in readiness for a start at Ponders End as soon as instructors can be appointed.At Cricklewood there are now 472 men in training ; this is probably the largest of the Government Instructional Factories at present at work.At the Birmingham (Lancaster Street) Factory, sales during August amounted to  953. During the month the responsibility for placing the trainees was undertaken by the manager, who had considerable experience in this work when the factory was under the Training Branch of the Ministry of Munitions. Under this arrangement, 33 trainees have been placed since the 9th August, 17 in improvers&apos; vacancies.The Forbesfield Factory. (Aberdeen) have received an order for 120 doors and 60 windows for the Board of Agriculture. Sales for August amounted to  1,200, and contracts are in hand to the value of  2,195.Equipment and Supplies.- Special steps have been taken during the week to complete the equipment of all building trade courses.Treasury Sanctions.The following are among the more important of a number of proposals which have received Treasury sanction since the issue of the last Report: Authority to train ex-Service men in certain branches of the glove-making industry, and to pay maintenance allowances for stated periods.Leave to authorise extensions of training in cases where, owing to the general state of industry, improvers&apos; vacancies are not immediately available upon the conclusion of the period of institutional training.The statement in the last number of this Report, on page 346, that the Treasury had sanctioned an extension of lodging allowance, in the case of single men living away from home in lodgings, is erroneous. They have, however, indicated their willingness to con-sider placing at the disposal of the Ministry a compassionate fund to meet the cases for which the extension was desired.Schemes Sanctioned.During the week 34 schemes, providing 826 places, have been sanctioned. Included in this number are 298 places for training in the vehicle trades, and 200 places for training in various branches of the building trade.
\APPRENTICES AND BOYS. INTERRUPTED APPRENTICESHIPS.Questions Affecting the Scheme.Wages. Difficulty in fixing the prescribed, rate exists in and around St. Leonards, partly because most of the firms are non-union, whereas Eastbourne is a union town and has a fixed rate. The apprentices in St. Leonards think that they should be paid the Eastbourne rate, which is higher than the rate they are receiving.The Scheme in Operation.Statistics. Up to the 8th September, 41 schemes had been approved. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 30th August, was 265, making a total of 43,621. The number of applications received from apprentices was 314, making a total of 48,996.Up to the 8th September, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 42,087 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 40,401 apprentices, employed by 16,050 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 9,939.Acceptance or Non-acceptance. The practice of placing an apprentice on trial and, if he proves satisfactory, of ultimately bringing him under the scheme, continues to meet with success. Messrs. D. Brown &amp; Co., Newcastle, engineers, for example, have brought an apprentice on probation under the scheme, and have paid him, retrospectively, from the commencement of his probation.The iron and sheet metal workers&apos; union&apos;s rule of one apprentice to five skilled men is restricting the employment of an apprentice at the works of the Army and Navy Co-operative Society, Ltd., Pimlico, S.W:Non-Observance of Conditions. The South Midlands and Eastern Area comment unfavourably on the non-observance of conditions by employers in Yarmouth.A threatened strike by the local trade union, and the intervention of local head-quarters, have resulted in Mr. T. Kodgers, Darlington, builder, paying the arrears due to an apprentice.Training in Operation: Progress. General satisfaction has been expressed by employers and apprentices in practically every area, but particularly in Scotland, where all parties seem to make the most of the facilities offered.Ex-Service Men-continued.National Trade Advisory Committees.Bui!ding.-A meeting of the Comittee has been called for the 15th September, when the following resolution will be considered : &quot; That, having regard to the numerous schemes and institutions for the training of disabled and fit unemployed men, quite apart altogether from the Government scheme for the training of discharged sailors and soldiers disabled in the late war with Germany, and, having regard to the possibility of a further number of ex-Service men being included in their present scheme, who have been, or who may be, disabled through this country&apos;s participation in the unjust wars now in progress all over the world, this National Trade Advisory Committee considers that, so far as its members are concerned, sufficient men have already been admitted into the building industry as to justify the closing down and putting a stop to any further training of men on and after the 30th September, 1920.&quot;Local Technical Advisory Committees.Boo&apos; and Shoe. The inaugural meeting of the Committee for Eastbourne was held on the 6th September. The committee agreed to supervise the existing class, and to consider the possibility of recommending further men for training.Electricity, Power and Light. -The first meeting of the Local Technical Advisory Com-mittee, Blackpool, will be held on the 21st September. This committee is being set up primarily to supervise the training being given at the convalescent centre at Squires Gate.Printing. At a meeting of the Local Technical Advisory Committee, Newcastle, on the 3rd September, it was agreed that the committee should at once take steps to investigate the possibilities for training in their area.
18.9.2a372Apprentices and Boys-continued.GENERAL TRAINING.Building Trade Apprenticeship Scheme. With reference to the Industrial Councils scheme a prominent Birmingham builder strongly commends the proposed re-introduction of formal indentures. He emphasises its necessity in the lads&apos; own interests, as the restraint helps to steady them during adolescence. Lads not indentured were often apt, without any good cause, to abandon trades for which they showed every aptitude. Reports from other areas indicate that employers generally are sympathetic towards the revival of indentured apprenticeship. It is pointed out, however, that lads have no longer the same financial inducement to submit to the long training associated with indentures, as the present labourers wage in the industry approximates so nearly to that of the skilled mechanic, who has to spend a good deal on tools.Engineering Trade: Apprenticeship Training. A leading Dudley firm, in a pamphlet describing their apprenticeship scheme, point out that changed conditions make it neces-sary that the apprentice of to-day should be trained along broader lines than in the past. He must be taught the principles on which his work depends. Formerly, the boys were directly supervised by the foremen, but the foremen have now so many duties relating to productive efficiency, that they cannot instruct or supervise the apprentice to any extent. &quot; All that they can be expected to do is to give the apprentice his work, briefly outline to him the method of procedure, and see that it is carried out according to require-ments. This view of a foreman&apos;s functions tends to strengthen the case for the appoint-ment of special instructors whose concern will be training rather than output.Bookbinding and Machine Ruling Trade: Apprenticeship Scheme. The National Union of Bookbinders and Machine Rulers have approved a scheme for a Male Junior Apprenticeship Section, membership of which is to be open to all lads &quot; serving after the manner of apprentices &quot; in the bookbinding, paper ruling and manufacturing stationery branches, from entry till the end of their apprenticeship. The objects are to regulate the number and distribution of apprentices, to give advice and guidance on trade and technical matters, to encourage apprentices to become fully qualified journeymen, eligible for transfer to the main section, and to make arrangements and agreements with employers as to the conditions of employment of apprentices and male juniors.Welfare Work: Rivet Boys.-The welfare supervisor of a large Scottish shipbuilding firm is arranging, for the coming winter, special classes for the rivet catch boys. The work consists of English, elementary calculations, and measurements, varied by instruction directly bearing on their trade. If they can be induced to attend the classes, it is proposed that in future apprentice riveters should be recruited from these boys, according to the capability and interest disclosed.  Thus, the occupation may become less of a &quot; blind alley.&quot;[Reference to matters of interest to the Training Department ivill also bey found on pages 360, 367 to 369 and 373.]INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : NEGOTIATIONS.Nursing.-A deputation from the College of Nursing called on the 10th September to discuss the feasibility of a Joint Council. It was agreed to make further inquiries as to the demand for such a body, and as to the degree of organisation existing.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : REPORTS.Electricity Supply-k meeting of the District Council for South Wales and Monmouth-shire was held on the 6th September. It was decided to send a deputation to the National Council to claim complete local autonomy in the settlement of wages, working conditions and similar matters. The District Council for the Yorkshire area met on the 8th September. An application for the National Union of Clerks for representation was referred to the National Council. Several questions affecting local undertakings, which had been referred to the Council, were dealt with.
 as.-The Council, which came to a deadlock on the question of holidays, week-end payments, and other matters, on the 30th March, and have not since met as a Council, will meet on the 23rd September to consider the subject of zoneing and grading.Needle, Fish-Hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades.-k meeting of the Wages Com-mittee was held at Redditch on the 7th September, to consider amendments proposed by the employers&apos; federation to the grading scheme. With regard to the grading of workers in the crochet hook section, the committee agreed as to Class B, which should cover workmen whose capacity is limited to certain sizes and classes of work, and are working under the supervision of a shop foreman, and further, that these workers should have at least three years&apos; experience if between the ages of 18 and 20, and at least two years&apos; experience if 20 years of age and over. The committee were unable to reach agreement on any of the other proposals, and it was decided to refer the matter back to the employers&apos; federation. A further meeting of the committee is to be held on the 14th September, and a meeting of the full Council on the 21st.Printing. The executive of the Typographical Association decided, on the 4th Sep-tember, that they would deprive Manchester and Liverpool strikers of all benefits. They also decided, however, that they could not recommend their members outside Manchester and Liverpool to produce work coming from these areas. The Council met again on the 6th to consider the situation created by this decision, and resolved : &quot;That this Council regrets that the Typographical Association is unable to give adequate assurance that their association will take satisfactory steps to terminate the dispute at Manchester and Liverpool. This creates grave difficulties for both sides of the Council. This Council urges the representatives of the trade unions to take immediate and effective steps to bring the dispute to an end, and also to help in producing work for Manchester and Liverpool.&quot;It was agreed that the labour panel of the Council should meet the executive of the Association at Portsmouth on the 8th September, with a view to persuading them to alter their decision on this point, and also to explore other means of terminating the Manchester dispute. At this conference the policy of the executive of the Association was reversed, and it was decided to recommend members to do work coming from Manchester and Liverpool. It was also decided to arrange a conference between the executive and the Manchester strike committee, under the presidency of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, in the hope of persuading the Manchester strikers to return to work.The Manchester employers appear to be issuing summonses against the strikers, claim-ing damages for the &quot;lightning &quot; strike. The employers have agreed not to extend the dispute beyond Manchester and Liverpool, without submitting their case to another meeting of the CouncilsPottery. The Wages and Conditions Committee met on the 9th September. A new scheme for interrupted apprenticeships was agreed upon, but the form of certificate proposed was referred to a sub-committee.The manufacturers moved an addition to Clause 4 of the suggested Particulars Clause, under the^ Police, Factories, &amp;c. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, but agreed in other respects to the draft. One of H.M. Factory Inspectors stated that the Home Office would not accept the addition, but that he would meet the manufacturers on the subject.Agreement was reached respecting the period of notice to be given to operatives, namely from the 1st September, 28 days for males and apprentices ; 14 days for females and male juveniles.Quarrying. The secretary of the Council has been asked by members of the employers&apos; side, representing the Chalk Section, to prepare constitutions for a Sectional National Council, District Councils and works committees, similar to those in the Limestone Section, as it is considered desirable that the chalk quarrying industry should cease to be tied to the cement industry, and should develop an individuality of its own.Tramway.-T\ie Council met on the 9th September. The question of the representa-tion of the.National Amalgamated Workers&apos; Union was considered, and it was agreed that steps should at once be taken to convene a conference of representatives of the National Amalgamated Workers&apos; Union and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, to endeavour to reach a. settlement. A constitution for works committees was approved, and the secretaries were instructed to forward copies to each tramway undertaking, with a recommendation that works committees be established as soon as possible.Vehicle Building. The National Federation of Vehicle Trades, the National Em-ployers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders and the Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association* See also p. 363 above.
18 9.20,374have been invited by the department to send representatives to an informal conference, under the chairmanship of the Principal Assistant Secretary, on the 22nd September, to consider means of effecting a reconstitution of the Council.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: WORKS COMMITTEES.Artificial Stone. The management ol the Craft Granite, Brick and Concrete Co. Ltd., Leicester, were interviewed. Owing to the fact that the firm carry on three distinct industries granite quarrying, and brick and concrete manufacture it was decided that a single works committee would be impracticable. A committee already exists for the granite section, and it has been decided to consider the formation of separate committees for the other sections.Flour Milling. At the following mills, all of which have works committees of an informal nature, the reconstruction of the committees, in accordance with the recom-mendations of the Council, is now under consideration: The Cobden Flour Mills, Ltd., Shrewsbury; Messrs. C. C. Prewett &amp; Co., Ltd., Horsham ; and the Horsebridge Roller Milling Co., Ltd., Hellingly.The secretary and several members of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers were interviewed at Glasgow. It was apparent that their attitude to the Whitley proposals generally is more favourable. A meeting of the Glasgow branch of the Workers&apos; Union was addressed; the meeting decided to bring the question of reconstituting the existing informal committees before the next meeting of the District Council.Pottery.-Th.e meeting of the provisional committee at the works of Messrs. Colling-wood Bros., Ltd., Burslem, was attended, and a constitution drafted in accordance with the recommendations of the Council. At the works of Messrs. Keeling &amp; Co., Ltd., Burslem, the management have decided, in view of the impending strike, to postpone the formation of a works committee. A meeting of the works committee formed some time ago at the Marsden Tile Works, Burslem, was attended by request. The committee, which devoted most of this meeting to dealing with claims on the sick benefit fund which has been formed, appears to work most efficiently. The management of Messrs. King &amp; Barratt, Burslem, were interviewed. At their request a mass meeting of the employees was addressed the following day, which decided in. favour of a works committee and elected a provisional committee to draft a constitution.Rubber. At the works of Messrs. Chess &amp; Stead, Ltd., Middleton, a provisional committee has been formed and arrangements for the elections are now in progress. The management of the loco Rubber and Proofing Co., Ltd., Glasgow, have agreed to revise the constitution of the existing works committee in accordance with the recommendations of the Council. The management of Messrs. J. T. Goudie &amp; Co., Ltd., Glasgow, have agreed to the formation of a works committee, subject to the approval of the directors.INTERIM INDUSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEES: REPORTS.Basket Making.-The Committee held their annual meeting at Pudsey, on the 7th September. A long discussion took place on the question of payment for holidays, and the matter was finally referred to a Standing Committee. A joint committee was appointed to deal with the question of dumping.Gas Mantles. The Committee met on the 6th September. An application for a wages increase of 20 per cent, was made by the operatives, with the further request that this should be paid only to members of the unions represented on the Committee. The employers offered 20 per cent, upon basic rates, with proportionate advances for piece-rates, subject to the ratification of their association. They could not, however, comply with the proviso asked for. The operatives deferred decision until the 23rd September when they will meet the manufacturers&apos; association to discuss the question of preventing importation which, it is claimed, is ruining the industry. The question of the future status of the Committee was adjourned until the next meeting, on the 11th October.Glove Manufacture. Meetings of the Fabric Sub-Committee, and of the full.Com-mittee, were held on the 7th September.

TRADE BOARDS DIVISION. PROCEEDINGS  OF  TRADE BOARDS.Button Making Trade Board (Great Britain). At the first meeting of the Adminis-trative Committee, at Birmingham, the question of co-operation between the Board and Juvenile Advisory Committees was discussed with a representative of the Juvenile Branch.It Was agreed to recommend to the Board that the examination of applications for permits of exemption should be made by the Local Employment Committees.At a meeting of the Special Sub-Committee of the Board it was agreed to recommend the Board to give Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates in respect of female workers employed on cut trocas, snail (with reference to weight), mother-of-pearl, and other classes of shells exceeding 22 ltys. per 100 shells ; kick stamping ; and swing turning-lathes ; so that such female workers would be entitled to the same minimum rates as male workers employed on the same processes.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board (Great Britain).-Th.e Minister has made an Order, dated the 7th September, confirming general minimum time-rates and overtime rates fixed for male and female workers, and piece-work basis time-rates fixed for female workers, and has specified the 11th September as the date from which these rates shall become effective.The general minimum time-rates are, for male workers 21 years of age and over, Is. i\d. per hour, and for female workers 18 years of age and over, 9d per hour; with correspondingly lower rates for younger male and female workers.The piece-work basis time-rates fixed for female workers range from 5dL per hour for workers under 15 years of age to 10cZ. per hour for workers 18 years of age and over.The overtime rates fixed for male and female workers of all ages, whether engaged on time-work or piece-work, are, for all hours worked on Sunday and statutory holidays, double time ; for all hours worked in excess of i\ on Saturday, time-and-a-half; and for all hours worked in excess of 47 in any week, time-and-a-quarter for the first two hours, and time-and-a-half thereafter, except where higher overtime rates are applicable.For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work to be 47 in any week, and 4  on Saturday.&apos; . &apos;      &apos;:V&apos;.-;i &apos; yESTABLISHMENT AND AMENDMENT OF TRADE BOARDS.Notice of Intention has been given to apply the Trade Boards Acts to the whip trade.    .[References to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on pages 361, 36$ and 375.].recommended to set up a series of local committees to deal with labour questions, these com-mittees to appoint the employers&apos; representatives on the fabric section of the Committee. It was reported that negotiations were proceeding with a view to including within the scope of the Committee the manufacture of rough leather gloves, manufactured as a side line by tanners and leather dressers. The report of the Wages Sub Committee that the last wages agreement did not constitute a sliding scale was confirmed, and it was agreed that the present wages should stand until the expiration of the present agreement on the 31st December. It was decided to agree to the departments proposal to carry out an inquiry to ascertain whether the Trade Boards Act should be applied to the industry. The inquiry is to be commenced by a report from the Committee on the present position and organisation of the trade.Optical Instruments, The employers&apos; side of the Committee have intimated to the Amalgamated Engineering Union that they are unable to concede any further wages advances at present owing to the uncertain conditions prevailing in the trade. The union&apos;s claim for a percentage advance to meet the increased cost of living will be con-sidered at the next meeting on the 22nd September.[References to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Councils will also be found on pages 358, 361, 363, 371, 372, 376 and 379.]
WAGES AND ARBITRATION DEPARTMENT.AWARDS.The number of awards issued during the week was eight, of which six were under the Industrial Courts Act.Urban District Council Staff (Malvern). On a claim for application of the Civil Service scale of war bonus, the Court decided that the recommendations of the Cost of Living Committee of the Civil Service National Whitley Council shall be applied to certain full-time officials, and should also be extended to certain part-time officials. This award to come into operation on the 1st September.  (Award No. 476.)Employees of Electrical Goods Makers (London). On a claim by the National Ware-house and General Workers&apos; Union for minimum rates and working conditions for the employees of three firms, the Court awarded minimum weekly rates for clerical staffs and counter salesmen, varying from 25s. to 65s. according to age, for male workers and, for females, rates varying from 20s. to 47s. 6d. The Court made no order in respect to working conditions.  (Award No. 475.)Engineering and Foundry Trades (Coventry) -The Coventry and District Joint Committee made application as to the method of ascertaining the net piece-work prices, to which is to be added the 15 per cent, advance granted under Award No. 180 relating to piece work prices in engineering shops in Coventry.In the opinion of the Court the 12J per cent, comes within the category of piece-price advances, referred to in Award No. 180, on which the 15 per cent, should not be calculated, and, in cases where the 12J per cent, has been merged, or forms part of the piece-price, the 15 per cent, should be so applied as not to be calculated on the 12J per cent.  (Award &quot; No. 471.)Water Works Employees (Ewden Valley). An ad hoc Board of Arbitration decided that a claim for building trade rates of wages had not been established. The rates for navvies and labourers were increased to Is. 9d. per hour, and for street masons and paviors to 2s. Id. per hour.AGREEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS.Glass workers (A lloa). -During the past week additional workers, formerly in the employment of the Alloa Glass Work Co., Ltd.,* have been re-engaged by the firm, who now have approximately 70 workers. These are sufficient for their present labour require-ments. As a number of the strikers have accepted positions elsewhere, the strike may be considered at an end.Boot Last Makers (Midlands).-On the understanding that the Workers&apos; Union would dissociate themselves from the strike at the works of the British-American Last Co., and cease financial support, the employers have raised the lock-out. The men returned to work on the 8th September. A joint meeting is to be held to discuss an advance in Wages. If the Northampton operatives have any real ground for complaint against the manager over whose appointment the trouble arose, the employers will give the matter due consideration.Iron Workers (Westbury).-After work was resumed a conferencef was held on the 24th August. The firm refused an application for an advance of id. per hour, but stated that this was because the claim had been made for the men as blastfurnacemen, whereas the furnaces were not working. The conference terminated without any discussion of the discharge of the three men, which was the original cause of the dispute. At a mass meeting of the men it was decided to cease work until the wages application had been granted. The men made a further claim that the company should deal with the question of overtime conditions.After further negotiations an increase of 2d. per hour, bringing the rate up to Is. 4d. per hour, and a 47-hour week, were accepted by the men, and work was resumed on the* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 4, 24th July, p. 163.t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 10, 4th September, p. 331.
31st August. It was agreed that overtime should be paid for at the rate of time-and-a-quarter for the first two hours and time-and-a half afterwards, and that the three men who were dismissed should receive a week&apos;s wages in lieu of notice.Sawmilling East Anglia . It is understood that the unions accepted the employers&apos; offer of Is. 9d. for sawyers and Is. 6d. for labourers,* but the matter has been further complicated by a number of the employers in the district having apparently failed to put the rate of Is. Gd. per hour for labourers into operation.COURTS OF INQUIRY, COMMITTEES AND CONFERENCES.Canal Workers. A &quot;oint conference of representative canal companies, bye-traders and the unions concerned was held on the 10th September at Montagu House in conse-quence of a claim by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen for increased minimum wages. Both sides agreed to a suggestion that the formation of some negotiating body appeared desirable. Arrangements were made for appointing a small sub-committee of six members on each side, the sides to confer at Montagu House on the 23rd September on the employers&apos; proposals.Electricians (Penistone). The Court of Inquiry appointed by the Minister is con-stituted as follows : Sir David Harrel (chairman), Mr. J. N. Bell, Col. J. M. Denny, Mr. John Hodge, M.P., Mr. T. B. Johnstone, Mr. Owen Parker and Mr. W. F. Purdy. Mr. H. W. Meikle has been appointed secretary.The terms of reference are : &quot; To inquire into the causes and circumstances of the dispute which has led to a strike of the members of the Electrical Trades Union employed at the establishment of Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., Ltd., Penistone, near Sheffield, and to a lock-out of the members of this union in the employment of firm&apos;s members of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations, with special reference to the position of foremen as regards trade union membership in the engineering industry, and report thereon.&quot;The Court will meet at St. Ermins on the 14th September.A conference of shop stewards in electrical undertakings in London was held on the9th September, when the following resolution was passed: &quot; That this meeting, representing the employees of the electrical undertakings of railways and tramways in the London district, demand that the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federation conform with the recommendation of the Ministry of Labour and raise the lock-out pending the result of the inquiry into the Penistone dispute. Failing this we ask our respective organisations to give seven days&apos; notice to withdraw our labour.&quot;The department have been informed by the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association that, in their opinion, the onus of responsibility in the present dispute rests with the employers&apos; federation, rather than with the Electrical Trades Union, and that the Asso-ciation, if involved, will support the union.fINTERPRETATIONS AND RULINGS.Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act.-Messrs.. McPhail &amp; Sons, Glasgow, brass-founders, before the war employed apprentices on light core work. During the war they replaced them by women. The Glasgow Munitions Tribunal convicted the firm of breach of the Act, but based the conviction on a wrong interpretation of the term &quot; trade practice.&quot; In the Appeal Court, Lord Sands therefore quashed the decision, and the case again came before the Tribunal, who called for evidence of the practice obtaining in Scotland. As the union Wanted the evidence limited to the practice obtaining in the Clyde area, the case again went to the Appeal Court, who decided that the Tribunal had power to call for evidence as to the practice in Scotland. At the third hearing of the case the Tribunal decided that the pre-war practice was not to employ women on light core-making, and that a breach of the Act had occurred. They held, however, that core-making is not a &quot; branch of an industry &quot; in the sense of Section 1 (1) of the Act, and that the question for their decision was the extent to which women were engaged in core-making relative to the number of workers available for that work, and not to the number oJ: men habitually employed on that work.  An appeal may be lodged against the Tribunal&apos;s decision.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 9, 28th August, p. 308. f See also p. 358 above.
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 11, 11th September, p. 339. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 11, llth September, p. 339. j See this Report, Vol. II, No. 8, 21st August, p. 282..QUESTIONS PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.Railway Shopmen (Glasgow). The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, as a result of representations by the department, interviewed representatives of the National Union of Railwaymen and. the blacksmiths&apos; union. Having received an assurance from the latter union that the local members would agree to the re-employment of the man with regard to whom a dispute has arisen,* the Parliamentary Committee undertook to investigate the whole matter, provided that the man recommenced Work immediately, and that the notice of a strike was immediately cancelled. Both unions agreed to accept these conditions. The local members of the blacksmiths&apos; union held a mass meeting on the 8th September, and were urged by the Conciliation Officer to accept the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee until a decision had been given. The men refused, and, after a ballot, 145 men struck on the 11th September.Platers and Platers&apos; Helpers (Clydej-The intervention in this dispute of the Clyde Shipbuilders&apos; Association, by convening the conference of the 30th Augustf and offering themselves as mediators, only aggravated the situation in consequence of their subsequent threat of a lock-out. The United Society of Boiler Makers and Iron and Steel Ship Builders offered to have the question referred to the Industrial Court for decision, and stated that, if the Court decided that the 15 per cent, represented an advance of 6s. per week to helpers, the platers would pay this amount; otherwise the firms should be concerned in the payment. The employers refused this suggestion. Lock-out notices were posted in the Clyde shipyards on the 8th September, to the effect that the services of all platers and platers&apos; helpers in the establishments affected would be dispensed with on the 15th September. Tentative arrangements have been made for the reception of a deputation of, the executive councils of the United Society of Boiler Makers and Iron and Steel Ship Builders and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour at Montagu House, on the 13th September.Blastfurnacemen: Notice in case of Coal Strike. The Scottish Ironmasters&apos; Association have pointed out to the department that men employed about blastfurnaces are on 14 days&apos; notice, and that it has been the practice in the past, when a general stoppage of work was threatened in the coal trade, or under similar circumstances, to give 14 days&apos; notice terminating contracts and afterwards to put the men on daily contracts. This enables the furnaces to work up to the moment when a stoppage is inevitable. When a blast furnace is once damped down, it takes a considerable time to get it into working order.In view of recent decisions of the Scottish Munitions Appeal Court in regard to the Munitions of War Act, 1917, which requires a week&apos;s notice to terminate contracts on munition work, the Scottish blastfurnacemen&apos;s association are of opinion that it is impossible to keep men for a continuous period on short notice, and that it is incumbent on the employers to use up the reserve stock of coal if, by so doing, it is possible to keep the men at work. If this view is upheld, the ironmasters&apos; association consider that before the expiry of the 14 days&apos; notice, which will be given simultaneously with the lodging of the miners&apos; strike notices, the necessary preparations must be made for damping down. This commits the furnaces to a stoppage, even if the miners&apos; strike is averted at the last moment. They therefore ask that the Minister should give them protection against any claim under the Munitions of War.Act for a week&apos;s notice.Wagon Builders: Great Northern Railway (Doncaster). On the 6th of September, the Amalgamated Society of Railway Vehicle Builders, Wheelwrights, Carpenters and Mechanics asked for the intervention of the department to end a dispute at the Doncaster works. They stated that they had tried unsuccessfully for about twelve months to have piece-prices adjusted to meet present circumstances. They threatened to withdraw the wagon builders employed by most of tbe main railway companies if no settlement was reached by the 11th September. Further representations have been made by the depart-ment to the General Managers&apos; Committee of the railway companies, who, it is understood, are in communication with the company on vthe matter.Council Employees (Cardiganshire).-The Chief Conciliation Officer has approached the Clerk of the Council,! who has agreed to convene a meeting of the special committee, and to arrange a conference between the committee and the trade union representatives.
Four-Monthly Hearings: Engineering Track-The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, on behalf of the unions affiliated to the federation, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and the National Union of Vehicle Builders, have given formal notice of withdrawal from the Agreement of February, 1917.Bakers (South Wales). In July last the operative bakers of South Wales claimed a further advance of  1 per week, with a reduction of hours from 47 to 42 per week. This claim was made directly after they had received an advance of 15s. per week, bringing the minimum wage up to  4 per week. A ballot is being taken on the question of a strike, the result of which will be known on the 13th September. The employers, however, are willing to discuss the matter with the men, and are satisfied that there is no immediate danger of a strike.  The Chief Conciliation Officer, Cardiff, is in touch with the parties.Paviors and Paviors&apos; Labourers (Wolverhampton). The paviors and paviors&apos; labourers employed on the permanent way of the Corporation tramways struck on the 4th September, for building trade rates of 2s. &amp;d. and 2s. Id. per hour respectively. The claim is based on the fact that the higher rates are being paid in other departments. The Tramway Committee contend that the wages of permanent-way men are regulated by the National Joint Industrial Council for the Tramway Industry, who have the whole question of standardising wages before them. The men complain of the slow procedure of the Council. Both sides have, however, agreed that, in the event of delay on the part of the National Council, they will hold a conference, at which a representative of the Ministry will be present, to find a solution of the difficulty, pending standardisation of wages by the National Council.Lairage Workers (Manchester), A conference of the parties was held by the Chief Conciliation Officer on the 8th September, at which it was suggested that the dispute might be referred to arbitration. The employers intimated later that they were&apos; unable to agree to arbitration, and the strike accordingly continues. The men employed in the frozen meat section of the trade gave a week&apos;s notice, expiring on the 10th September, to cease work in sympathy.Lairage Workers (Birkenhead). The employers are unable to agree to any further increase in wages* owing to the state of trade. They are not prepared to refer the matter to arbitration. The union are considering what action they will take, and are meanwhile endeavouring to enlist the support of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation with a view to preventing the importing of cattle from Ireland, and holding up the cold storage depots. The local representative of the Ministry of Food is working in conjunction with the Chief Conciliation Officer, Manchester, but the situation is complicated by the fact that five of the largest firms concerned have depots in the Manchester district, where the men are on strike. This is adversely affecting the more conciliatory spirit which prevails in the Liverpool district.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Wages and Arbitration will be found also on pages 359 to 363, 367, 371 and 372 to 375.]
