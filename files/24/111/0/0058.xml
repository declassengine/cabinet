Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 10th September 1920.Following is weekly telegram : Provincial reports show attention focussed on Special Congress which met on 4th. Prior to meeting, resolutions adopted accepting non-co-operation in principle, but leaving details to decision of Congress. Press reports of sessions show 25,000 persons, including 5,000 delegates representing all provinces, present. Great, though not universal, enthusiasm, evinced. Hunter Committee recommendations, Turkish Peace Treaty and non-co-operation points for discussion. Prominent Moderate leaders absent, rank and file largely represented. Chairman of Reception Committee, Mr. 13. Chakravarti, condemned Plunter Committee Report, criticised House of Lords attitude towards General Dyer, claimed for India independence on lines of Egypt, and emphasised Hindus should stand by Muslims to last in Khilafat movement. President Lajpat Rai devoted mam portion to Punjab events concentrating-on attacks on 0&apos;Dwyer, urged that it is duty of every Indian to press for punishment and prosecution of 0&apos;Dwyer, and owed it to themselves, their women and children, to seek for- redress for Amritsar atrocities, pressed recall of Viceroy, unreserved moral and constitutional support to Muslims in Khilafat agitation, gave no opinion or lead on non-co-operation, but left it to Congress. Opinion held that Congress circles generally favour principle of non-co-operation, but differ widely as to practical application. Large body of leaders take view that boycott of Councils and professions is ill-advised. Subjects Committee on 5th sat seven hours discussing non-co-operation without any definite decision. Press comments vary. C. and M. Gazette characterises Presidents speech indefinite and inaccurate. Pioneer says rehased old stale diatribes against Punjab with object of exciting racial animosity and providing stimulus to non-co-operation, already beginning to hang fire. Leader considers whole view of position and prospect taken by President more gloomy than justified by facts. Bengalee warns non-co-operation should not be discussed in huff. Bengal, wise by experience, refuses to be caught by glamour of scheme destined to fail. Tribune considers address manly and outspoken outpouring of Punjab&apos;s, lacerated heart. Bandematram eulogises excellent handling of Khilafat question. Madras Mail criticises President for want of clear directions as an impartial judge upon expediency, advantage or risk of non-co-operation. Madras Times surprised no decided opinion for or against non-co-operation indicated. Hindu considers address overwhelmingly judicial. New India wants President not allow Congress be driven over to non-co-operation principle by feeling that Khilafat and Punjab have aroused in any gospel of despair. Justice congratulates President on making no definite pronouncement on non-co-operation.Congress re-assembling 8th. Si]&apos; Ashutosh Chaudhuri moved postponement of Congress with a view to gaining time to consider non-co-operation in all details, but motion lost by large majority, and after whole day&apos;s sitting Gandhi&apos;s programme adopted by majority. Debate very exciting as well known nationalist leaders ranged against Gandhi. His programme includes renunciation of titles and honorary offices, boycott of&apos; foreign goods, Legislative Councils and gradual withdrawal of children from schools and lawyers from practice. Only weapon non-co-operation; non-violence should be their creed. Gandhi maintained if scheme adopted, India would obtain complete responsible Government in one year. Mrs. Besant strongly opposed as impracticable, unwise, inexpedient and dangerous. B. C. Pal moved exclusion of boycott of Councils from programme and suggested appointment of Committee to examine programme with a view to eventual adoption, lt may be noted however that in article in Democrat, Pal has denounced non-co-operation in Army and Police as unconstitutional. Malaviya, O. R. Das, Jinnah and Baptista supported Pal. In Congress Gandhi&apos;s motion declared carried, but division demanded and poll taken with following-result. Total number of delegates registered 5,814, out of whom 2,773 voted, of these 1,S26 voted for Gandhi&apos;s proposal, and 884 for Pal&apos;s amendment. Gandhi had majority in all the provinces except Central Provinces and Berar.5th September.   All-India Moslem League held under presidency of Maulana (? groups omitted) a violent Mullah from United Provinces who made a strong appeal to audience to make every sacrifice for Khilafat and to follow dictates of Islam at this 2273-1  100  9.20
moment when soreness was going to be extinguished. Save for Willoughby&apos;s murder Id passed oil without any violence or trouble anywhere. In some places sacrifice of cows on smaller scale, but generally speaking no change in attitude of rank and file of Mohamedans towards cow sacrifice. Willoughby&apos;s murder aroused public inclig-nation in United Provinces, sympathetic references in press both moderate and extremist throughout India save Bombay Chronicle, in which belated and lukewarm reference on 2nd September. In United Provinces itself meetings held to express indignation. , Reports received that extreme Pan-Islamists and Khilafat agitators do not conceal in private delight at murder, considering their work begun to bear fruit; at the same time they realise public condemn murder politically, otherwise work will suffer and Central Khilafat Committee been asked from United Provinces to do so.Yakub Beg has urged Central Khilafat Committee who promised to subscribe to Hijrat Fund to issue urgent circulars stopping Hijrat, as returning Muhajarins estimated at 10,000 continue returning and complaining of pitiable condition. Their treatment said to have excited intensely bitter feeling against Afghans and promoters of movement. Nevertheless, All-Tndia Hijrat Committee passed vote of thanks to Amir for reception of Muhajarins.Normal conditions re-established in Hazara district. Deputation of Peshawar Khans and Maulvis visited Mansehra on 3.1st August. At large meeting, general relief expressed that elements of disorder removed without violence. Sufferings of Muhajarins and sympathetic efforts of Government to assist appreciated by Deputation. People gladly returning to usual occupations, and growing atmosphere of confidence and goodwill. Tribesmen from Black Mountain attacked military at Oghi twice, but each time repulsed. External situation well in hand, many tribal sections realising folly of outbreak.In Delhi little attention paid to non-co-operation, but agitation growing against imposition of indemnity paid for expenses arising out of disturbance. Little money so far collected, and poor prospects of any large amount being got in even by resort to distress warrants. Chief Commissioner giving matter careful consideration, and - will submit full appreciation of situation at end of September.Madras publishes letter from one Maulvi Zahid Hussain, stating that he did not surrender title of Shamsul-Ulema of his own free will, but forced to do so by threat that he would not be allowed burial in Mohamedan Burial Ground. Similar letters been received indicating exercise of undue force to secure renunciation of titles. The tone of the Press everywhere continues to be violent, regret expressed at Turkey&apos;s signature of peace terms, and view frankly held, especially by independent, that independence of Egypt should lead to India&apos;s separation from British Empire. Withdrawal of Egypt materially weakening India&apos;s position as a member of Common-wealth of White nations. We have issued a circular to all Local Governments explaining that, while our policy in regard to non-co-operation movement remains unchanged, we hope that those guilty of incitement to violence will be prosecuted more vigorously than in the past. We are also instructing Local Governments to collect material for prosecution of Executive Sub-Committee of Khilafat movement in case such action becomes necessary.
