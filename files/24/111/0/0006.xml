65II. PUBLIC HEALTH.Appolntrfient of Outdoor Medical Officers^    The Minister has appointed 35 Medical Officers (including 5 Officers vdth supervisory functions) after considering the recommendations of a Selection Committee composed mainly of Jiiedical practi-tloners.     These officers have been appointed to act as referee consultants under the National Health Insurance Scheme with the object of protecting insurance funds from unnecessary claims to sickness benefit and improving the general standard of insurance medical practice.    Funds for this purpose were originally voted by Parliament in 1914 but not spent during the war owing to the impossibility of establishing this much needed extension of the Health Insurance Medical Service during that time.2*   Proprietary Medicines Bill.    This Bill, which gives effect to the recommendations of the Select Committee which reported in August, 1914, received its second reading in the House of Lords on the 8th August, and passed the Committee stage with certain minor amendments on the loth August.     On the Committee stage Lord Astor undertook to   consult the trade with regard to the disclosure of formulae before the Report stage was taken. 3.   Port gcinlj:ary -Administration.    The conditions resulting from the war and the serious prevalence of acute infectious, diseases such as smallpox, typhus fever, etc. in various foreign countries have made it essential that all practical measures should be taken by port sanitary authorities to prevent the introduction into this country of infectious diseases by shipping from abroad.In this connection the Ministry have had ipider eonsiteration the measures to be taken to secure Improved port sanitary administration generally (including the supervision
4of imported foods and the administration of Regulations under the Public Health (Regulations as to Pood) Act, 1907), as well as the prevention of importation of Infectious diseases from foreign countries.As the scope and character of the existing powers of port and riparian sanitary authorities were inadequate to enable them to carry out the necessary measures for dealing with infectious diseases other than cholera, plague and yellow fever, respecting which they have special powers under Regulations made by the Local Government Board in 1907, in accordance with international agreement, the Minister on the 14th July made the Port Sanitary Authorities (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1920.    These Regulations were issued with a covering circular (No.107) dated 2oth July to all port and riparian sanitary authorities in England and Wales and to their Medical Officers of Health, and came Into force on the 1st August.    The provisions of the Regulations, which are fully explained in the circular, confer further powers and impose additional duties upon these authorities and upon their Medical Officers If Health to enable them to take all requisite measures for preventing the introduction into their districts, by shipping, of any epidemic or acute infectious disease.With a view to encouraging and assisting the proper development of this important service, the Ministry &quot;have approached the Treasury and provision has been made in the estimates of this Department for the payment of a grant in aid at a rate not exceeding one half of the approved net expenditure out of revenue by port and riparian sanitary authorities.    Regulations for the administration of the grant have been made and approved by the Treasury and have been issued to the authorities concerned.m    5    &quot;
67III   GENERAL.1. Rent Restriction Act.      A summary prepared by the Department of the principal provisions of this Act has been published and has had a large sale.2.
