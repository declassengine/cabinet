Q QQiiw *m    ** *mThere is no improvement in the industrial situation, though it is evident that some of the miners1 leaders would gladly avoid a strike in any conditions, while all would welcome an escape if it did not entail loss of prestige.    Reports are given of the Reeling in the various coalfields.Details of the undercurrent in the Portsmouth Lahour Congress are reserved for next week&apos;s report.Indications at the moment are that the look-out of electricians may result in the stoppage of the engineeriig industry: officials of the er-gineers left Portsmouth for London on Tuesday. The London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union has / called a special meeting of Shop Stewards in the Tramway and Municipal undertakings, which may result in the threat of a reprisal strike.No settlement of the claims cf the road transport workers or railway shopmen has yet been reached.Pottery workers, numbering about 70,000, have handed in strike notices to expire on October 1st,Unless a settlement is reached, a look-out of platers and helpers in the Clyde shipbuilding industries will be doolared.%      Particulars are given of the efforts at revolutionary i propaganda made by the Russian Trading Delegation.Local/
B -Local Councils of Action are adopting revolutionary resolutions.   3?he-Lambeth, Council seeks to establish a &quot;Civil Guard&quot; with Police strikers as instructors, and the Stratford Co-operative Society has offered to place its stooks of foodstuffs at the disposal of the local Council of Action in the event, of a general strike^  Messrs. Adamson and Purcoll are to go to Siga to investigate the Russo-Polish situation on &quot;behalf of the National Council of Action.(The &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee has prepared a circular to bo distributed among the troops on the Rhine, It has, however, received a rebuff from the Painters1 Unioi and steady men are becoming alarmed at tha new excursion of the Union leaders into international politics.There is little change in Ireland, except that a rift between the more moderate and the extreme Sinn Feiners is developing.
TW. COAX MIlQjRS&apos; &apos;Tlie following is a summary of the reports from my correspondents in various coalfields: South WalesTho demand for the increase in wages is extremely . popular and the men are determined to secure it,   There is at the same time great opposition to a strike for the &apos; reduction in the price of coal, the miners arguing that a benefit for the whole community should &quot;be fought for by the whole community and not by one section of Labour. Generally speaking, the men will support their leaders, but would prefer, in many oases, settlement by negotiation to a strike.A special general delegate meeting of the South Wales Association of Colliery Baginsmen,   Stokers and Craftsmen -has endorsed the demands of the Miners1 Federation of  reat Britain; a joint siib-committee of the Association and the Federation has been appointed to act if a strike be declared. The Association, which embraces practically all the colliery craftsmen in the South Wales and Monmouthshire and forest of Dean coalfields, has a membership of between 6,000 and 7,000.The Executive Council of the South Wales and &apos;&apos;Monmouthshire Colliery Officials&apos; Union has resolved &quot;that in the event of the Miners&apos; Federation calling all the workmen out, the eouneil instruct its members to do what is necessary to keep the mines open.&quot; LancashireIn spite of the large majority for a strike, the miners in this area do not v/ant a strike, provided that the wages demand be conceded.   This they are determined to secure but are willing to drop the question of a reduction in price,   They are opposed to the submission of the wages claim to the industrial Court, from whichthey/
** E **they allege that the workers do not get fair play,   The men are convinced that the looal coal-owners are keeping down production in order to weaken the ease for nationalisation and say that they are kept short of tubs and encouraged to lose a shift now and then.The miners&apos; wives do not want a strike but many say that they are with the men in the wages demand.Railwaymen. dockers and other transport workers are not in favour of striking in support of the miners. YorkshireOfficials of the Yorkshire Miners1 Association have started propaganda meetings in order to put the miners1 oase before the Yorkshire public.  Very little le said about the wages claim, but much Is made of the 14s. 2d. reduction.  A minority of the workers is said to favour the miners and local trades union leaders are giving moral support.She miners think that a wage compromise will be offered and, if balloted upon, accepted. Northumberland and DurhamThere is a strong desire for a settlement without a strike and the general opinion among the miners is that this will be secured.   On September 4th, Mir. Cann, the secretary of the Durham Miners&apos; Association, stated \ publicly at Burahope that he did not think there would be a general conflict.Mars den Miners1 Lodge has taken an unofficial balloton the question of a strike to reduce the cost of coal,with the following result:For a strike 695Against 1130Majority 435The Durham Miners&apos; Association does not approve of this ballot and disclaims all responsibility.   Local branches of the National Union of Railwaymen have discussed/
discussed their attitude to the miners1 dispute during the week-end; ?31yth has deoided to &quot;assist&quot; the miners but Newcastle Ho. 4 passed a resolution impressing upon the Executive &quot;the absolute necessity of taking a ballot......before, any decision is arrived at or action taken in tho present crisis, thus giving to us the same privilege  as that enjoyed by other trade unions in the oountry,&quot; MidlandsThe Midland miners are not in the least concerned about a reduction in the price of coal, but consider that their wages claim is justified.   They are convinced that owing to the strength of their organisation and the importance of their industry they can obtain a better standard of life. The majority thinks that a wages compromise will be effected.The men would welcome an enquiry into the causes of reduced oulnmt, for which they maintain that the coal-owners are responsible.   They complain of shortage of tubs and of the present contract system.The Warwickshire Miners&apos; Association has recently invested  25,000 in the Co-operative Wholesale Bank.Railwaymen and transport workers are not anxious to strike in support of the miners.   An official of the National,Union of Railwaymen at Leicester stated that.if the railwaymen were called out not one man in twelve in that town would obey;   he for one would, not.   It is probable, however.,., that both railwaymen and transport workers would obey orders not to handle certain goods. Scotland     ...Extremist propaganda is rife in the Lanarkshire coalfield and it is stated that the revolutionary, element is anxious to strike in any case as it is suggested that after   the &quot;first week, the management of the mines could be taken over by miners1 committees.TEfi/
M*     A     MTHE TRADE UKIOfl 00KSRBS3By adopting, unanimously and without discussion, a resolution declaring that the double olaira of the minors is &quot;both just and reasonable and should be conceded forthwith&quot; the Congress has endeavoured to convey to the Government and to the general public an impression of Labourrs solidarity.   It is, however, quite clear that this was merely a tactical move and that a large percentage of trade unionists will firmly decline to give the miners more than moral support,The real interest of the proceedings lies in what is going on behind the scenes, but this must be reserved for next week!s report.   The delegates are much in the public eye in Portsmouth and are addressing open-air meeting a in their spare time.   A well-informed correspondent sums up the general opinion in the following words:   &quot;Things cannot go on as they are at present, the strain is so great that &apos;   something must break.&quot;  Some of them argue that revolution is the only remedy, but that Capital is so highly organised that it will not be safe to move until Labour 1b unanimous. They qnote the Government attitude towards the miners, the lock-out of electricians, the treatment of the Lancashire printers and the decision of the Industrial Court regarding the engineers1 claims as an attempt by Capital to force a fight before Labour becomes too powerful.   One delegate expressed the opinion that the General Staff for Labour will organise a general strike in support of the miners. IIt is not at all certain that if a General Staff        1 is formed the miners will give it whole-hearted support:   J they will probably make a condition that the component unions retain full autonomy, especially with regard to strikes.

r 6 -In spite of Mr. Thomas1 declaration that the National Council of Action would dissolve as soon as its one objective, peace with Russia, is obtained, there is      ^ increasing&apos; evidence that local councils have the intention If not the power, of widening their scope.  For instance, it le reported that Lambeth Central labour party Counoil of Action has passed a resolution requesting the National I Council to consider the advisability of establishing a Civil Guard, the nucleus of which should be the members ofl the National Union of Police and  rlson Officers, who woulj act-as-trainers. \;i,*: &quot;-JV;,*On September 5th the Hcrth Sastfe District Council S Of Action, which is stated to oover 24 constituencies, met at Durham and passed a resolution calling upon the national Council to remain in aotlve session until universal peace has been secured in Europe and all British troops ^removed from Ireland, Egypt, India and Mesopotamia.in interesting example of local organisation Isprovided by the Merthyr Borough Council of Action, whichhas &quot;been formed for &quot;the organisation of industrial workers to function:in time of crisis.tt  $hie prime moverisHoah Abiett, wio issued the following manifesto tolocal labour bodies:&quot;Bo sooner are we but of one crisis than, janother develops.   If it is not the Russian-Polish    I war, it is the Miners1 strike; if that passes then    J another will surely arise.   These crises are arriving at a time when there is a world shortage of commodities, and they consequently threaten the existence of the capitalist system&apos; of production. To meet aucih a situation we have a Trade Union movement bent mainly upon ends which affect their Own industries.  Should the crash come, how can the workers be welded into a disciplined cohesive force capable of resisting anarchy and bloodshed? low can it obtain the neoessazy guidance to commence the ; ;  development of a new order of society?  The analysis of the dissolution of existing society has received much attention, but this other is a problem to which very little thought;has been given.   The imperative need of the moment is seriously organised -thought. The constitution of the Merthyr Council of Action is designed for that purpose.   It is to be hoped that r   -   all other localities are doing the same thing, andthat/
that shortly the whole of South Wales will be able to meet in a conference of thoroughly organised Councils of Action,&quot;The following constitution has been dram up by Ablett, S.O. Davies, and the editor of the Merthyr &quot;Pioneer&quot;:Objects1,    To co-operate with and carry out any instructions of the National Council of Action, either to remain in or come out of work as the National Council shall decide and instruct.2.    To investigate as thoroughly as possible by means of committees the steps necessary to be taken in any National or local emergency that may arise.3,    To federate with all local Councils of Action within the area that shall be determined to be an economio and geographical area.ConstitutionThere shall be a Central Council composed of ?A representatives from the organisations affiliated or eligible for affiliation to the Trades Council. They must be appointed by mass meetings of the workers, under the distinct understanding that the representatives have the right to call the workers out of work or instruct them to remain at work as the Council shall determine.The General Council shall be made up as follows:-Group Number ofRepresentatives1.   Miners 6 ,   Railway Workers                * 33,   Steelworkers 34.   Building Industry 3 .5.   Shop Assistants and Bakers 26.  General 37.   Co-operative Guilds and Women 38.   Labour Press 1The Rhondda &quot;Council of Action&quot; is formed on similartlines, and co-operation between the two bodies has been established.   A.J. Cook is prime mover in the Rhon&amp;da Council, and in conjunction with Bavies and Ablett, will use the new movement as a preliminary to the establishment of the Soviet system of government.An/
M       Q       MAn important private meeting; has taken place&apos; between the Stratford Co-operative Society and delegates of the     1 local Council of Action.  Mr, Barnes, speaking on behalf of the General Committee of the Stratford Co-operative Society, of which he is president, offered to plaoe the whole resources of the Co-operative Society at the disposal of the local Councils of Action immediately the expected crisis arose and a General Strike was ordered, Mr, Barnes pointed out that this referred to the actual foodstuffs in the granaries and warehouses of the Society; further that these supplies were limited and that therefore it would be necessary, at such a time, to secure further supplies by taking possession of all stocks of foodstuffs or other necessaries which were in the hands of the merchants, deale rs, warehouses and pr irate trade rs.   It would also be necessary to commandeer means of transport and distribution in order to secure the regular supply of necessities to the workers in the districts concerned.Mr. Barnes then proceeded to.point out the difficulty of undertaking these measures at a critical time and in a speedy manner; and suggested, on behalf of the General Committee of the Stratford Co-operative Society, that each looal Council of Action should appoint two delegates to sit on a permanent committee which would immediately set to work to get the neojpssary machinery ready to put in motion when the crisis came.The local Council of Action elected two delegates to sit on the suggested; permanent committee.The value of the stocks of the Stratford Co-operative Society on June 1st w 3 as follows:(rroceries Bread DepSt Flour Dairy 134,43714,971 2,816 1,048 158,672These/
Those stocks are spread over the central warehouse and 28 branches.   The Edmonton Co-operative Society which fused with Stratford on September 8th, 1920, has separate stocks to the value of:Groceries  66,763Dairy .   - . 256Bakery 4,262 71,281The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress has issued to societies a request for payment of the levy of one halfpenny per member to finance the national and local councils of action, as authorised by the labour Congress of August 13th.     ,;It.is reported that Messrs. Henderson and Macdonald have sent a friendly letter to M. Branting expressing the great surprise of the English Socialists at the extreme sympathy shown by his party for Poland.   The British leaders are energetically urging M. Branting to lean as little as possible towards the Left as his politics can only favour the Swedish Bolsheviks.THE NATIONAL &quot;HANDS OFF RUSSIA&quot; COMMITTEEThere is now indisputable evidence that this committee, which is believed recently to have received money from Nogin, has been the direct oause of practioally all the pro-Communist agitation in this country.   It ia interesting to note that the wife of the secretary ia Zelda Kohan Coates, a Russian by birth.W.P. Coates lias drawn up a circular addressed to thetroops in occupied areas and is now trying to obtain thesignatures, of well-known labour leaders.   Tom Mann hasalready signed unconditionally, and says &quot;I consider it quite a useful thing to do, no matter what the risk maybe attending same.&quot; .J. Bromley, General Secretary of the associated Society of Locomotive Enginemen- and Firemen,is/
is somewhat more cautious: &quot;A manifesto to troops is daring, but you can append my name if any four of the five others...also agree to sign.&quot;The proposed text of the circular is as follows: NATIONAL &quot;HANDS OB&quot; RUSSIA&quot; COMMITTEETo the troops in the occupied areasComrades,Wo address you as comrades because you are members of the working class.   Many of you have enlisted because you could not get jobs at home. Many of you served during the &quot;Great War&quot; iaad you were promised a place in a land fit for heroes to live in.   Did you get it?   You know you did not. No?? you are soldiers again although we know that you swore &quot;never again&quot; to entey the Army.At present you are engaged in service in the occupied zones., but the army law provides that you may &quot;be moved anywhere at any time.   You may be sent to Poland, and because of this we address you.The British workers have decided to resist to the utmost any attempt to aid the Poles to crush Revolutionary Russia - the only land fit for heroes and workers to live in.   The British Government cannot use British workers for their dirty work, but they may try to use you, because you are out of close touch with us.Be on your guard.   Endeavour to resist the attempts that may be made against your Russian brothers.   If the Army Regulations and the discipline that holds you in its iron chains is such that you cannot escape from being made the accomplices of the I enemies of the workers, then realise to the full that every shot you fire is fired against men who do not wish to fight you, but are simply defending the land they have won for themselves.They have appealed to us for help.   They have appealed to us to work for peace.   That is proof that they do not want war.   Now we appeal to you.Several of the men  whose names appear below have visited Russia, and from their personal experiences these men, who are trusted by British Organised Labour, call upon you to do all you can to defeat those who are your enemies and ours.Don&apos;t Blackleg British Labour.Don&apos;t Blackleg the Russian People. ^The question of taking action in regard to thiscircular is under consideration.THE/
- ii - 436THE BUBSIAN TRADING DELEGATIONIt is now quite clear that Messrs, ICameneff and Irassin are almost solely concerned with propaganda,   &apos;.Very little trade is being done, but there has &quot;been great underground aotivity in fomenting revolutionary movements.   Mr, Kenworthy has stated publicly that M, Eameneff has complained to him that the British Government is putting every possible obstruction in the way of trade with Russia,   During the last two days M, Krassin has made two requests for an interview with me without the knowledge of his own colleagues, but an excuse was found for declining.It Is evident that the Delegation has heard that enquiries are being made about the jewels which were handedover to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, for an attempt is to be made toexplain the transaction away by pretending that they were handed to Mr, Francis Meynell and sent by him to Moscow,and to support this fiction a message is to be sent en clairfrom Moscow acknowledging the receipt of the jewels.   The transaction has now been traced, and there is evidence which could be produced in Court that Mr, Meynell received 40,000 a day or two before the 20th August, when the&quot;Daily Herald&quot; declared that it had not received &quot;a Bond,a Franc or a Rouble.&quot;   The money was invested in ExchequerBonds.THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF GREAT britain as was to be expected, the moving spirits of theCommunist Party are busily at work.   They are holding- meetings in many parts of the country and are preparing.an extensive campaign for the winter, when it is hopedthat unemployment will add largely to the roll of membership.   Two London Communists named Bishop andTyler have already started on a sort of missionary tourthrough the provinces and a house to house canvass of theBorthern cities is contemplated.   My correspondentreports/
reports that Bishop and Tyler have drawn fairly large,Hthough not wholly sympathetic,audiences in Coventry. Their collections, v/hlch constitute their means of livelihood, average about 10s. nightly and  2 on Sundays.iThe following extracts from speeches made on September 4th and 5th by George Ebury, one of the Party&apos;s national organisers, indicate the nature of Communisttoratory and the attitude, of the audience, which numbered in each case about 1,000.September 4th.

Tho editor statos that whereas the Party olaims to have nine branches in Glasgow, the meeting held to inaugurate a branch was attended actually by nine people and ho presumes, therefore, that each person is now a secretary.   He further-claims that other alleged Scottish branches do not exist.TRADE UNIONISM 1KB POLITICSAn encouraging indication of the possibility that thesteadier trade unionists will tiro of the ceaselessagitation of revolutionaries is contained in a letterrecently sent by a branch secretary of the National.        &apos;Amalgamated Society , of -Operative House and Ship Paintersto the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committeej&quot;Re &quot;Sands off Russia&quot;Your circular dated July 31st. 1920, was read at our branch meeting of August 28th.   Our branch numbers 770 and it was decided not to support your action.   I fail to see, should the Labour Party be elected to Government, how they can govern the country if they aid and abet direct action.   We have our Governments elected by the majority and much as we disagree with things they do we have our remedy at the Poll if we use it.   The Labour Party are losing the ground they made during the war and will continue to lose ground by supporting such actions as you suggest.With regard to miners there is little sympathy here for them, it is miners fcaly who will benefit by what is suggested.   I have relations, miners, who get 6 cwt. of coal a fortnight free, as much wood and candles as they require, and then stay away from work to keep below the Income Tax,   Our country will do no good with men such as these.  As for Nationalisation, well, if anybody but officials benefit it will be a ohange,   I believe the time is now coming when the miners will find they are doing themselves harm.I may add Circulars re &quot;Hands off,Russia&quot; have been before the branch on other occasions but meet with little support.   In faot our members are strongly protesting against politioal questions with Trade Unionism.&quot;PROPAGANDA/
PROBAGANDA IN THE IPO ROES.     . .... &apos;There is evidence of considerable efforts to undermir the loyalty of the Forces, hut it is not   possible to estimate the measure of success attained.   The National union of Ex-Serviee Men is particularly active at Portsmo and Southampton, and in the latter town is-striving to cause dissatisfaction in the Ordnance Survey Department. A.E. Man der and Benson of Plymouth are said to be frequent visitors in the area.One of my correspondents reports that on September3rd many sailors were present at a meeting of the localibranch of the National Union of Ex-Service Men which was Iaddressed by miners1 delegates.   These sailors were very Isympathetic- towards the miners and said they would refuse fto work in any mines to which they might be sent in the&apos;event of a strike.  My correspondent sends the following report on this subject:&quot;Some of the Congress delegates are getting about amongst the men of the&apos; Royal Havy, &quot;meeting them in the Publio Houses which they use, and are &apos;  -being very well received.   There is considerable      j unrest in the Navy, dissatisfaction with the pay, the prospects of promotion, arid general conditions, particularly the manner in which the food is cooked I and served, and the men make a good audience when it is explained to them how, by organising, they are! able to alter all that an/1 get their grievances redressed.   There is already talk amongst the men of I getting into an 1 outside&apos;&apos;1 * organisation since they have lost faith in the Welfare Committees, but one thing they seem afraid of and will have nothing to do with, is Bolshevism.&quot;    \A delegate of the National Federation of building trade Operatives is going among&apos; sailors and urging themto form an &quot;Outside organisation&quot;,   He told my oorrespondefthat one of the young officers of a ship which he and othdelegates visited told the men that they should make theii;oomplaints to the delegates, who, he claimed, would remedytheir grievances.On/
On September 5th the Southsea branch of the Labour Party held a demonstration which was attended by several thousand people, including a fair number of sailors and soldiers.   Kirkwood urged the former to refuse to obey orders to proceed to Russia.jjgjB CEKTRAL M30UR COLLEGEThe Central Labour. College, which is the fountain head of Marxian teaching in this country, will shortly be extended.   The present accommodation is sufficient for only 28 students and the resident staff.   The Executive has now decided to purchase property at Kew, at an initial cost of  SI,OOO, in which 70 additional students will be accommodated.   It is hoped eventually to erect buildings for 300 students.This development is important, as the growth of revolutionary feeling, especially in South Wales, is largely due to the teaching of men who have been trained in the Central Labour College.GEORGE TUR1EROn September 1st George Turner, to whom reference was made in my report !lo. 69-t was ordered by the Justices of the Acton Petty Sessions $o enter into hia own recognisances for a like amount,: to be of good behaviour fot twelve months, and to refrain from taking an active part in the conduct of the International Union of Ex-Service Hen or addressing revolutionary meetings.SIM jgj IK CHEAT LRITAIBThere hr-s been an increase in Sinn Fein activity during the week, especially in South Wales.

There is undoubtedly a strong Strain of fanaticism among the younger Sinn Feiners, many of whom are pledged by oath to obey orders, regardless of the cost to themeelres;  or this reason reprisals will probably be attempted in the event of the Lord Mayor1s death.On September 5th the Trades Union Congress decided to send a telegram w bhs  overrent stating that Labour would hold the Government responsible for the Lord Mayor1s death, and that their, &quot;blind stupidity&quot; would render a -reconciliation between Britain and Ireland almost impossible.A rumour is current to the effect that Mr, Maione is prepared to organise an armed attack of ex-soldiers on Brixton prison;   Sean McGrath, however, does not trust him and places little confidence in the proposal.The Press report that young Irishmen in Sunderland were drilling with rifles is a distortion of faot; actually the Catholic counterpart of the .Church Lads1 Brigade were using, as part of their routine/, Lee-Metford rifles of an obsolete pattern,  .The Trafalgar Square meeting&apos; held by the &quot;Hands off Ireland&quot; Committee on September 4th was attended by about 400 people, many of whom were casual spectators.   The meeting lasted from 2.30 to 7.15 pfm. and the speechesiwere uninteresting.
country, although tho nunhor of police casualties was smaller and several attacks on police and their barracks were frustrated with loss to the assailants.   In all 393 offences of an indictable nature were reported; of these 337 were directly attributable to Sinn Fein, nine were of an agrarian nature and the remaining 52 were serious miscellaneous offences.   The increase i3 mainly attributable to the fact that there were no loss than 114 instances of raiding for arms by bands of disguised and armed men.   Sinn Fein is aware that Oroverrmient intends to cancel all permits to keep and carry arms and that the police will shortly take up all such weapons,and the Irish Republican Army has evidently reooived instructions to be beforehand in the matter.   Many of these raids proved abortive.   Bight vacated Ro^al Irish Constabulary barracks, two courthouses and four coastguard stations were maliciously burned during the weok.   There were numerous instances of firing on police patrols and waylaying individual policemen.   Twenty-two other incendiary fires were also reported.There were 52 acts of highway robbery and robbery of mails.   Intimidation by means of personal violence, threatening notices and letters was rampant in the south and west and on eleven occasions persons were kidnapped for trial at, or in obedience to, the orders of Sinn Fein courts.Some useful arrests were effected by police and military and a number of interesting Volunteer documents obtained.Rioting still continued at times in Belfast and Party feeling is now acutely inflamed in the north and in many localities only a spark is needed to start a general conflagration.   The military and police forces ire insufficient to cope with such a situation,A/
A very bitter feeling exists in police circles at the liberty allowed to the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and &quot;Freeman1m Journal&quot; to inflame public opinion against men who are only doing their duty.   To the baneful influence of these two papers they attribute tho murders of many of their oomradeo,The railway position remains unchanged and traffic on many lines is very muoh interrupted, .A quarrel is developing between the more moderate section of Sinn Fein under Arthur Griffith and the Extremis represented by Michael Collins,
