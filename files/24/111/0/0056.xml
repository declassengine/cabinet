H.M.S. &quot;Triad&quot; are manning two T. class river vessels on the Tigris for patrol of the narrowd.On arrival at Basra of Officers and ratings from H.M.S. &quot;Clio&quot;, it is probable that the former will be with-drawn, and four Ply class gunboats manned by the Navy.R U S S I A,Finland.The German Admirals Meurer and von Hintse are in Finland - the proverman party is endeavouring to appoint these Officers to the Finnish Fleet with the object of eventually Germanising the Naval forces.   This intrigue requires careful watching in view of our trade interests in the Gulf of Finland and Baltic.   H../I. Government have informed the Finnish Government that their view is that the limits of territorial waters do not extend beyond a distance of three miles from low water mark.
RUSSIA      (Oonta.,)BaltiovRed Fleet.   An unconfirmed report states that Raskolnikoff nas teen relieved as Baltio Fleet.Confirmatory- reports have he en received which indicate grea,t discontent in the Fleet owing; to his endeavour to tighten up discipline and improve the seagoing efficiency., The majority of commissioned ships are reported &quot;based at Kronstadt where the discontent is more pronounced.   Corrobor-ative reports as to the shortage of fuel have been received,Britlsgi For 63L Rear-Admiral Sir CiFerguson assumed command orThe^SalTiTTorces on 7th Sept.,1920.   He has been informed that four Light Cruisers will be maintained in the Baltic until the situation clears, when it is intended to re-duo e the squadron (to that shown in Section 2 of A.L. M.02254 of 10th July, 1920.)SaS*-JVor22:^11 w:^to Polish and Lettish troops arrived aOHiatliam on 11th September, 1920, en route to Baltic ports.   Pt?ess reports that U.S.S. Pittsburg&quot;   has grounded in the vicinity of Libau.   Reports received indicate Bolsheviks are very apprehensive of attack on the shores of the Gulf of Finland a   At Oranienbaum they are hurriedly and intensively fortifying a defensive coast-line and putting up wire entanglements, machine gun positions and observation posts*South Rus sia.   Red Fleet *    The Bolsheviks are tils-playing considerable activity at Nikolaev in repairing small craft.   It is reported that they are completing the four submarines at this port.fr-in^C, Mediterranean as Hi$i Commissioner has re-ported that the Italiana are pressing for the resumption of free trade with Soviet ports in the Black Sea.   He states that he and the French -High Co::aiissioner are against this.Georgia.   O^-in-C, Mediterranean reports that two or three shipsTiave&quot; sailed, or are about to sail, from Novorossisk to Trebizond with arms for Kemalists*   He asks British Corn-mis sioner at Tiflis if this move is connected with Soviet deputation at Batoum, and foreshadows a Turco-Bolshevik attack on Batoum Province.Azerbaijan^   The negotiations for the exchange of British NavaXprisoners at Baku for Turkish prisoners at Malta have failed, as the latter belong to the Turkish Government. The Foreign Office have informed Litvinov that it is proposed to continue to detain Russian nationals in the power of the BHtish Government until the release of our prisoners a.t Baku is effected.   Meanwhile the condition of the prisoners remains most unsatisfactory, and no reliable co;.xiunication with them is possible.,J U G 0   -   island? I A.Difficulties are arising in regard to the 12 T.B.ls now at OATTARO which the Austrian Peace Treaty assigns to JUGQ-3LA.VIA.The French propose to evacuate OATTARO- on,the 1st Oct.
J U G 0   -   SLAVIA       (Oontd.)OATTARO fomis part of the ADRIATIC territory whose alloca-tion is not yet decided pending a settlement of the differ-enbes between ITALY and JUGOSLAVIA.H.M*S* &quot;Ramillies13, on passage home, will be present at the evacuation if required.R 0 U II A N I A.Commander BALANSSCU, charged by his Government with the completion of negotiations regarding sale of British warships to, and establishment of a British &quot;naval mission in, ROUMANIA, has arrived in LONDON.UNITED   STATES   OP   AMERICA.President Wilson has informed the Cabinet that lie has decided that, in spite of provisions of the Jones Shipping Act, he will not denounce any treaty or any clause in a treaty oven though he has been directed by Congress to do so and even thouj*L its continuance will prevent the Act being put entirely into force.This decision if likely to produce a constitutional crisis which may assume considerable magnitude.
II.   GENERAL     INTELLIGENCE&apos;.PERSIA.Latest reports confirm that Bolshevik troops have now left Persia and that there is no Shipping at Enzeli.E GYP ToGenerally speaking the majority of the people are more than satisfied vdth the results obtained, at Zaghloul s Mission to London.   The extremists are very disheartened at the present turn of events, and the Anglophiles are somewhat apprehensive as to what the result will be of so much power passing into the hands of their own rulers.M E S 0 P 0 T A M I A.The tribes in the vicinity of Nasiriyah below Samawah are to be reckoned as definitely hostile, but so far have refrained from active operations against us; should they con-oontrate in force against Nasiriyah, the difficulties of relieving Samawah vd.ll be very much increased.Briefly the situation is as follows(a) The control of the Middle Euphrates is lost, and railway communication with Baghdad is closed.(b) The Baghdad Mosul line of communication is still open, but uncertain..(c) Upper Euphrates situation uncertain, but there is no serious threat from that direction.(d) Persian line of communication restored, and situation improving.(e) Kurdistan unrest, but no general outbreak.(f) Tigris line of communication so far undisturbed.R U S S I A.Lenin1s attitude is for peace at any price to save Russia, especially as the harvest has been poor, and it is not seen how without peace the coming winter can be faced.Latvia.   The Lettish Constituent Assembly signed peace treaty with Russia on 2nd September, 1920.   Large contracts have been placed with American Companies for supply of railway locomotives and rolling stock generally.   Pood on the v/hole is more plentiful.Lithuania.   The intermittent fighting with Poland con-tiiiues inThe Suwalki region.Poland.    The Peace Delegates are expected to arrive at Danzig during the week.   It is proposed to transport them in two destroyers to Libau and thence by rail to Riga, where the Russian Delegates will be met.
R.U S 3 I A   -(Oontd.)South Russia.    General Wramel&apos;s operations continue to oonaisS&apos; of&quot; a^erTSs of raids delivered at different points on the ooast with the object of dividing the Bolshevik Forces and consolidating the offensive allianoo with the Don  and Kuban 0ossack3 whichf if effective, will hold up the Bolshevik fuel supplies in the Donetz Basin and Crozni oil-fields area.   These raids have been more or less successful.Caspian and, feana^Oauoasus.   A report dated 29th August states that owing to differences between Bolsheviks and&apos; Oaornunists a peasant revolt has broken out in Astrakhan Province.   Bolshevik;warships have sailed for Astrakhan and troops are evacuating Baku.   The offensive against Persian Littoral has for(the, moment been delayed, but there are strong indications that the former Russian policy of complete domination of Persia is as active as ever under the Soviet regime and will have to be faced in Trans^Caspia and Persia in the near future.   Bolshevik W/t reports that Zinovievf   Bukharin &amp;nd Bela Kun are on their way to the Orient Congress at Baku accompanied by the delegates of the 3rd International.   British Labour Delegates have been granted passports to Georgia and presumably will attend this Conference^ &quot;Anti-Bolshevik movements in North Caucasus and ^Paghestan are reported to be increasing.G I R MANYHerr Friedrich Stahmer, who has been German Charge d Affaires in London since 13th February, 1920, presented his credentials as German Ambassador to the Permanent Under -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 11th September, 1920. &apos;The German Authorities have expressed their regret to Poland and France for the Breslau disturbances and offered to give full satisfaction and punish the offenders.HUN-GAR Y*M. Friedrich, ex*-Premier, has been handed over to the examining magistrate for his alleged implication in the murder of Count Tisza.0ZE0KO - SLOVAKIA.A Treaty between the Principal Allied and Assooia-ted Powers and Poland, Roumania, the Serb-Croat-Slovene State and Czecko-Slovakia regarding certain frontiers of these States was signed a* Sevres on the 10th August, 1920.italy the feature of the week1 s news from ITALY is the systematic occupation of the factories by the workmen, in face of which there appears to be a paralysis of government emphasised by the absence of the Prime Minister.Flume.      Fiume Press Reports of the 9th instant announced^that&quot; D!ANNUNSIO had. proclaimed ah Italian Regency of the QUARNARO. -
I T A h Y      (Contd.)It has been, arranged between the Italian and Jugo-Slav Governments to recommence direct negotiations on the ADRIATIC question and those will very likely take place in LONDON.ALBANIAWhile oonilrming their undertaking to halt on the line of demarcation the Jugoslavs are hurrying troops to the front.   It is also stated that many Albanian tribes have turned against the TIRANA Government, which is likely to fall, and there is not much difference betv^een the Jugo-Slavs marching on TIRANA and their instigating Albanian tribes to do so.GREECEM* VENISELOS has been requested not to occupy NORTHERN EPIRUS, pending a final settlement of frontiers by the Supreme Council, and has given an assurance that he will not do so.TURKEYThe oamtpaign against the Grand Vizier, DAMAD PERID PASHA, is greatly aided and abetted by the Heir-Apparent and there are also indications that the prench are not averse, to his fall.In the Smyrna area the Greek forces have been engaged in minor &quot;Clearing up&quot; operations and have occupied Gediz. &apos; Constantinople is reported quiet.ARABIAReports from MECCA confirm newspaper statements to the effeot that King HUSSEIN is in conmunication with MUSTAPHA KEMAL.PORTUGAL.Situation at Lourenco Marques.Alarmist reports have recently occurred in the press pointing to a very serious industrial situation at Lourenco Marques.    These reports include the proclamation of martial lav/, threatened sabotage by railway strikers and anxiety of British subjects for protection by one of H.M.Ships.   A tele-gram however received from H.M. Consul General, Lourenco Marques, on the 11th September, contains a denial of these reports.   Although a railway strike is in progress the sugges-tion of the possibility of flanger to British lives and property is absolutely unfounded; the local Government have the situation well in hand.
- 8 *-C H I N A*On September 10th the Russian Minister in Peking was warned by the Chinese Government that he would shortly cease to be recognised.   This may entail the suppression of Russian Concessions at Tientsin and other places in China. Russians in China will probably fall back on the French for semi-official protection.Severe faminedue to crops which do not exceed 8$ of the normal, has spread over a considerable area in Northern China.   The provinces affected are Chihli - Southern portion, Shantung, - Western portion, and Honan.(Press).A massacre of Chinese Christians is reported in the East River district in Kwangtung province i.e. to the Northward of Hong Kong.(Press).
