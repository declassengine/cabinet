SECRFT,, (^A B I N E T. f\c.p., 1856.- PROPOSED RT QVAT  OF THE OFFICESOlTTffR WAT COMMISSION.(Memorandum &quot;by Lord Crawford.! I trust the cabinet will consent to defer moving the offices of the Royal commission on Wheat Supplies to Kensington.Though I am anxious to take my share in promoting economy, this transfer which may save a few thousand pounds in rent, must result in such loss in other directions and in such general dialo-cation, that i am impelled to lay the matter before the Cabinet.The obligations and&apos;responsibility of my commission are large, our turnover amounting to over  1,000.-000 a day.   I can justly claim that our staff is moderate in compass, while few, if any public offices have so large a proportion of Unsalaried officials. Our outlay on rent is quite incommensurate with our financial responsibilities, ano the ratio of our costs to our sales amounts to 2/7df per    100-The Bread subsidy, and the control of Flour Mills will end with the financial year, after which it is hoped the Royal Corn-mission will cease to be an executive body,   our accommodation can then be curtailed; but I urge that in the meanwhile the confusion involved by migration will gravely impair the efficiency of our work. One might easily lose in an hour more than a year&apos;s economies arising from transfer - quite apart from the loss in interest to the Exchequer consequent upon the extra mileage involved, which will be at the rate of  2q,000 a year.   In any case I must make it clear that during the weeks following a coal strike the work of flour dis-tribution will demand such close- and unremitting attention, that a transfer will be out of the question.   I hope&quot;, therefore, that the consideration of the proposal can be postponed until next spring.(Sgd.)    CRAWFORD OF BALCAHBES. Hoyal commission on wheat Supplies, Trafalgar House, .Waterloo place, S.W,13th September, 1920-
