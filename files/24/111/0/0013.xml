COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO BREACHES OF THE LAWS OF WAR.INTERIM REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.1. At the first meeting of the Committee held in Committee Room No. 5 at the House of Commons on 6th November, 1918, the Attorney-General in the Chair, the Attorney-General de-livered the following address to the Committee:- .THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL&apos;S ADDRESS.The Attorney-General : Gentlemen, the object of our meeting here to-night is known to all of you, but it appeared to me that it might be convenient if, at this the first meeting of the Com-mittee, I made a few general observations which may remind you of the circumstances under which this Committee has been asked by the Government to undertake certain duties. The general points affecting the whole sanction of Public Law which have been raised by this War are well known to all of you. Many of you have written, and written with great weight and authority about them, and all of you have thought and spoken about them. I can very shortly describe them. We do not, at this stage, invite or propose to consider other views upon this question. Our own view is that an aggressive War was forced upon the world by an ambitious and unscrupulous power, and that the challenge so developed involved the whole future of the Public Law of States. In other words, the challenge which proceeded from Germany meant this, and it meant nothing-else : We think that we are strong enough to conquer the world; believing ourselves strong enough to conquer the world we care nothing for all the doctrines of International Law; if we win, and we are convinced that we are strong enough to win, the inherent weakness of International Law immediately makes itself manifest, in other words, inasmuch as we shall be the conqueror, inasmuch as&apos; International Law has no sanctions which it can apply to the conqueror, it is a matter of the most complete indif-ference to us whether in the judgment of those, whom by our hypothesis we shall have vanquished, we have broken Inter-national Law or not.gentlemen, it is necessary freely to admit that had Germany been right in her anticipation of the result of this struggle, the view which that country had formed of the future of Inter-national Law would have been well founded; ill other words, if the weight of those doctrines had been defeated by a power which in the first place had publicly challenged them, and in the second place had made good that challenge by the success of her arms, public law and the sanctity of treaties would have disappeared in our day and our generation from the world. The German Empire, assisted by her Allies, made this challenge and
has submitted it now for four and a half years to the arbitrament of arms. It is, indeed, fortunate for us and our Allies, and &apos;it is fortunate for the whole cause of civilisation that that challenge has failed. For observe the consequences of failure. The point of essential difference between Municipal Law and International Law has long been a commonplace with those who have written or thought upon such subjects. In our Municipal Laws punish-ment waits upon the wrong doer, and the presence of punishment -immediate, inevitable is one of the primary and essential marks of a civilised community, xlll of us have been familiar, all those, who have contributed immeasurable industry and great learning to the gradual evolution of the doctrine of International Law, have been well aware of the weakness of International Law upon this point. But they have been content to believe, since the day when the genius and the humanity of Grotius first created the foundations upon which the great doctrines of International Law were to be built, that there would never be such a retro-progression into savagery that any great community would challenge these doctrines with the result of flinging the whole world back from civilisation into a welter of savagery. Gentlemen, that challenge was made. As I have said, happily and providentially, with how narrow a margin of success^ few even of those who are here know completely, only those can know completely who have partaken of the immediate secrets of the Government in the last four and a half years it has failed and it has defini-tively failed, and the question has now arisen, what steps ought to be taken, not. for the purpose of wreaking any spirit of idle vindictiveness, but for the purpose of re-establishing the autho-rity of International Law. I hope, gentlemen, and I believe that when we say, as we say to-day, that we are determined to take any steps that are necessary to reassert, and to reassert under circumstances of the utmost possible notoriety, the authority of those doctrines, that we say so not in the spirit of men who are greatly concerned to exercise or take pleasure in exercising punitive functions (I do not think that is in the minda of any of us) but looking as far as we can with cool and passion less eyes into the future of theWorld, we are determined that our children and our grandchildren, and those even who come after them, shall be spared what this generation has gone through. To us it seems that the most effective deterrent of all is that for all ages men who are tempted to follow the wicked and the bloody path which the Governors of the Central Empires have trodden during the last four years, shall have present before their eyes, not a picture merely of the brilliant and meretricious glamour of military success, but also the recollection that in this great conflict punishment attended upon crime. Gentlemen, it is certain that in the events that have taken place in the last four and a-half years many great crimes against International Law have been committed. That conclusion is not very vigorously disputed even in Germany to-day. The very origin of the War, the violation of Belgium, will for all time, I think, be remem-bered in the pages of history as one of the greatest crimes against civilisation. I do not invite you, it would not be possible that such a task should be imposed upon you, to consider how far a .209(52 A i
given individual should be made responsible for the highest of all the crimes against civilisation. The enquiry into the origin of the War cannot usefully be undertaken by you. As to those crimes, which necessarily raise questions of the highest and most delicate politics, I think it probable that you will deem it neces-sary to make certain investigations of fact. But the great questions of policy which will then be raised can obviously be dealt with neither by you, nor by me. They must be dealt with by Councils in which all the Allies will be represented. So far as the examination of documents, so far as the statement of con-clusions upon questions of fact are concerned, I think that even in relation to those the highest questions of all you may render a very useful contribution, but it is evident that the work to which you can most usefully contribute at least I think this will emerge as your enquiries proceed will be that of fixing and assigning responsibility for specific breaches of International Law in very many branches and departments of the War. I do not pretend to attempt an exhaustive classification of those cases because to do so would be to attempt a history of the War, but if I select one single illustration it is because in relation to this branch of the enquiry there has been already very considerable investigation. I have in my mind the case of wrongs and out-rages and crimes which have been committed upon the bodies of prisoners of war. There are obviously very many other matters of that class to which you may devote yourselves. But it is far from being my purpose even by suggestion, because I cannot pretend to have considered this matter as deeply as it will very soon become your duty to consider it, to attempt to give you a classi-fication of the various branches of the subject to which you will probably think it necessary to devote your attention and your time. I may, however, perhaps usefully read to you the Terms of Reference and you will then see what generally is the work to which the War Cabinet has asked you to devote yourselves.The Terms of Reference are expressed in the following lan-guage: The Law Officers of the Crown have been authorised by the War Cabinet to appoint a Committee to enquire into and report upon&apos; the following:  (1) The facts as to breaches of the laws and customs of war, affecting members of the British Armed Forces or other British subjects, committed by the Forces of the German Empire and their Allies on Land, on Sea, and in the Air, during the present War.I pause to make an observation upon that. As many members of this Committee will be aware there is already in existence in France a Committee which has devoted itself, I cannot tell you, with precise accuracy, to how many of the problems which are suggested by the very general language of this first para-graph of the Reference, but it is within my knowledge that they have devoted themselves to many questions affecting the treat-ment by the Germans of French prisoners of war, and more particularly to the treatment of the French inhabitants in what are usually known as the occupied regions. It will certainly become necessary at some stage of your enquiries that Liaison be established between the French Committee and your Com-mittee, and proper steps will be taken by your officers to see
95that such Liaison is conducted in the most convenient manner. Proper facilities will be given by the Government for such inter-communication as may become necessary either in this country or in France between your Committee and any Committee formed by any other of the Allies to enquire into similar matters.The second paragraph of the Reference is: &quot;The degree of responsibility for these offences attaching to particular members of the German forces, including the German General Staff, or other highly placed individuals; (3) The constitution and pro-cedure of a tribunal appropriate to the trial of these offences; (4) Any other matters cognate or ancillary to the above which may arise in the course of the Enquiry, and which the Committee finds it useful or relevant to take into consideration.&quot;The words in which clause 4 of the Reference are drafted have been very deliberately adopted. Their object is that the Com-mittee should feel itself at liberty, without any limitation at all, to use its own discretion to apply itself to any subject cognate to those more precisely indicated, the exploration of which in their judgment may prove fruitful to the general purpose of the Government, and I hope that the Committee will consider that the War Cabinet, so far from wishing to limit in any way the range of their Enquiry, has rather given an indication of the confidence which they place in the Committee, having regard to its constitution for which equally with the Law,. Officers they are responsible, by leaving it so entirely in their discretion as is indicated in clause 4.What precisely shall be the range of their enquiries? I am authorised to state to the Committee that it is the intention of the Government to give them any assistance in any facilities which may be required. It is obvious that the general range of enquiry for which the Committee will be responsible involves many departmental and inter-departmental questions and all the Departments of the Government will receive formal and clear instructions that they are to assist the Committee by supplying evidence, or by sending, if it be necessary, witnesses before thent, by making all relevant documents admissible, and in short in any way which may suggest itself to the Committee as being useful. Such instructions either have already been given or will be given and the very constitution of the Committee itself, embracing as it does very responsible members representing the War Office, the Admiralty and the Foreign Office, will guarantee that the efforts of the Committee will not at least fail through the lack of au-thoritative information. I have, I think, only to add this, in such matters the responsibility of the Law Officers is perhaps properly considered one which arises at a later stage. My col-league and I, as of course everybody knows, have the respon-sibility of giving definite and final advice in such matters to the Government before decisions are taken, and this Committee, rightly looked at, must be regarded as a Committee which has been good enough to assist my colleague, the Solicitor-General, and myself at a time when the burdens which are imposed upon us are very weighty and very numerous, by clearing the ground in order to make certain preliminary enquiries. I need hardly say that either, or both of us, will always be available if any
point of special complication arises in which it is thought by the Committee that our presence will lie useful; we shall be always ready to attend and the Committee must take the view that we shall at any moment be willing to mark our sense of the services which the Committee is rendering to the Government by making any contribution which it is in our power as Law Officers to make.Now gentlemen, it is of course necessary that you should have a Chairman, and a Vice-Chairman and Secretaries. I do not even venture to forecast the method which you may judge to he the most convenient method of carrying out the laborious en-quiries which will become necessary, but I venture to anticipate that you will soon form the conclusion that some sub-division of your labours will be required. The subject-matter of your enquiries is varied, many subjects are raised, and it may be that you will consider it a convenient course to sub-divide yourselves and to form sub-committees in order to present reports to the main Committee. The Government have thought it right at the outset to inform you, as I do to-day, that if in your discretion the number of those sub-Committees makes an undue strain upon the personnel of the main Committee, that we give you free discretion to co-opt such persons as may be suitable to assist you in any subordinate or further enquiries that may become necessary. I need hardly point out to you that expedition is of very great importance. Events move so rapidly to-day that it may be that at least a preliminary recommendation might prove to be valuable in a period of time which may be very short, and I would therefore venture to urge upon you as far as it may be possible most of those who are serving here have other duties to perform, and indeed if they were not in the habit of dis-charging other duties competently they would hardly be here  at the same time, making all due allowance for that circumstance, despatch is a very important part of your duties. I would there-fore venture, as far as circumstances permit, to urge upon you the importance of despatch. It has become necessary, of course, for the Government to consider the question of who should dis-charge the duties which belong to a chairman and to a vice-chairman and secretaries. Here again, of course, we should be extremely unwilling in any way to fetter the discretion of the Committee, but after very careful consideration I have decided to recommend to you the following names, making it quite clear that the discretion of the Committee is in no way fettered. In the first place it is proposed, and I do propose it to you, that Sir John Macdonell should be the Chairman of this Committee. The name of Sir John Macdonell is known to every student of International Law; his public services, his courtesy as a Master, his great learning, need no words of mine and I cannot help thinking that you will be fortunate, if you should share that view, in obtaining a Chairman of his industry and of his very great attainments and knowledge. I propose also that Professor  I do not know whether I ought not to call him Captain Morgan  Professor and Captain Morgan, whose authority on Constitutional Law is known to all of you, and who has the very great advan-tage of: having made many preliminary researches and a mosi masterly report upon the earlier outrages of the War, should
undertake the duties of Vice-Chairman, and I understand he is willing, if that be your wish, to undertake those duties. The work of the Secretaries is hardly less important than that of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, and I think you will agree with me that we have been fortunate in securing two gentlemen as joint Secretaries of the Committee from whose industry and knowledge of the subject I expect, and I think the Committee will expect, very great results. Dr. Hugh H. L. Bellot and Mr. J. E. G. de Montmorency are both willing, if it be the pleasure of the Com-mittee, to undertake the duties of Secretaries. I would, there-fore, venture to make a comprehensive motion, thinking this may not prove in practice to be inconvenient, but susceptible at any point of amendment, that Sir John Macdonell and Professor Morgan be appointed respectively Chairman and Yice-Chairman of the Committee and that Dr. Bellot and Mr. de Montmorency be appointed Secretaries. I have only to add, in conclusion, before I formally put that motion, that the Government fully realises the sacrifice which busy men are being asked to make in giving up their time, and so much of their time, to this Enquiry, but realising that they nevertheless do not hesitate to make the demand, because they sincerely believe that there never has been a moment in the history of civilisation in which it was in the power of a conquering country or of conquering Allies to do more to assert and place upon a firm foundation for all time the sources and the only sources upon which public law can depend and survive.I beg to move that these gentlemen be appointed officers. Is it your pleasure that those names be adopted as the Chairman, Yice-Chairman and Secretaries of the Committee?If there is no other suggestion or name that proposal is carried and I will ask Sir John Macdonell to take the Chair. I myself must go to other duties now, and I will only add once again  I think I am speaking for my colleague as well as for myself  that we are both at any time entirely at the disposal of the Committee.PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE.2. At the outset of our enquiry we found it necessary, as sug-gested by the Attorney-General, to divide the subjects covered by our Terms of Reference under various heads, and to refer these to Sub-Committees for detailed investigation of the immense mass of material already collected and to he collected; the offences, for instance, alleged to have been committed on land amounting to&apos; many thousands of cases. These heads fell naturally into three divisions, viz.: (1) Breaches of the Laws of War on Land. (2) Breaches of the Laws at Sea and in the Air; and (3) the Law applicable to such breaches.Accordingly, three Sub-Committees were appointed, viz.: (1) The Sub-Committee for Offences on Land; (2) The Sub-Committee for Offences at Sea and in the Air; (3) The Sub-Committee&apos;on Law. Subsequently it was found convenient to appoint a separate Sub-Committee to deal with offences committed from the Air,
and on December 19th, 1918, a Sub-Committee for Offences in the1 Air was appointed.3. The first question to engage the attention of the Committee was the determination of the nature of the Tribunal to be created for the trial and punishment of offences deemed contrary to &quot; the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity &quot; and of the constitution of the Tribunal.After discussion as to whether the Tribunal to be created should be of a National or of an International character, it was resolved by the Committee at their meeting on November 19th, 19.18, that &quot; an Internationa] Tribunal be established, composed of repre-sentatives of the Chief Allied States and the United States for the trial and punishment of offences contrary to the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity,&quot; and that such &quot; Inter-Allied Tribunal be empowered to sit in Divisions to try such cases as might be assigned to them by the Inter-Allied Tribunal, and in cases peculiarly affecting the subjects of any one nationality the majority of a Division might consist of national members.&quot;4. It was further resolved by the Committee that it be provided by the Treaty of Peace, or preferably by some earlier arrange-ment:  &quot; That the enemy Governments shall recognise the jurisdiction of the said Tribunal, that all enemy persons alleged to have been guilty of offences against the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity shall be excluded from any amnesty to which the belligerents may agree, and that the Governments of such persons shall undertake to surrender them to be tried by the said Tribunal.&quot;5. It was resolved by the Committee &quot; that in the event of. it proving impossible to secure the consent of the Allied and Associated Governments to the establishment of an Inter-Allied Tribunal, the British Government be recommended to take steps to establish a National Court.&quot;6. On November 21st, 1918, a special and wholly independent reference was made by the Attorney-General to a Special Sub-Committee, consisting of the members of the Sub-Committee on Law, together with the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Mr. Justice Peterson and Mr. C. A. Gill, with a request to report to him directly, with as little delay as possible and without waiting for a meeting of the Main Committee, upon the following questions: -(1) Whether it is desirable to take proceedings against theGerman Kaiser? (2) What should be the nature and constitution of theTribunal for the trial of the German Kaiser? (3) What should be the chief heads of the charges to be preferred against him? (4) What should be the law to be applied by the Tribunal ? (5) What should be its procedure ?7. On November 28th, 1918, the Report, as adopted by the . Special Sub-Committee was presented to the Attorney-General.** For thiB Report see p. 95.
8. On November 29th,.upon the instructions of the Sub-Corh-mittee on Law, the Secretary, Dr. Bellot, drafted the Interim Eeport to be submitted to the Committee for approval and adoption.9. On December 1st, the Secretary received a communication from Sir Maurice hankey, Secretary to the War Cabinet, asking for a copy of the Committee&apos;s Eeport. Dr. Bellot forwarded a copy of the Eeport mentioned in para. 7, and also a copy of the Interim Eeport of the Sub-Committee on Law mentioned in para. 8, with a letter stating that it was only his draft, based upon the Sub-Committee&apos;s instructions, and that it had not yet received the final approval of the Committee.10. In his reply acknowledging the receipt of the two Reports, Sir Maurice Hankey stated that, acting Upon the Attorney-General&apos;s instructions, he had circulated the Interim Eeport to the Imperial War Cabinet with the following note:  &quot; This Eeport has not received the formal sanction of the -Law Officers of the Crown, but is circulated by them as a contribution towards the discussion of the question of the attitude of the Allies towards the ex-Kaiser.&quot;.11. On December 2nd, 1918, at a Conference of the Govern-ments of France, Great Britain and Italy, it was agreed to recommend that a demand ought to he presented to Holland for the surrender of the person of the Kaiser for trial by an International Court.12. In pursuance of a request from the Attorney-General for expedition, the following Eecommendations of the Main Committee were forwarded to him, in an Interim Eeport dated 19th December, 1918.13. Interim Eecommendations.of the Committee.I.

The Law to be Applied by the Tribunal.That the law to be applied by the Tribunal be &quot;the principles of the Law of Nations as they result from the usages established among civilised peoples, from the laws of humanity and the dictates of public conscience,&quot; and in particular the regula-tions contained in the Hague Conventions and Declarations and the Geneva Conventions so far as the same or any of them may be applicable,VI. Power op Punishment.When the accused is found by the Tribunal to have committed an act in breach of the laws and customs of&apos;war or the laws of humanity with which he is charged, the Tribunal shall have power to sentence him to such punishment as it shall think proper.
VII. Procedure of the Tribunal.(I) That the accused be entitled at all stages of the proceed-ings to be represented by counsel or other legal advisers, or, subject to the permission of the Court, by any other person whom he may nominate.(2) That the charges against the accused specify clearly the alleged offences, that they be in writing, and that copies of them be given to him and his legal adviser in a reasonable time before the trial.(3) That the Court have power to amend any defect in the charges at any stage of the proceedings.(4) That the accused be supplied with a list of witnesses for the prosecution with their names and descriptions, and a sum-mary of the evidence to be given by each of them; but this shall not preclude the Court from admitting the evidence of such witnesses as it shall think proper, notwithstanding that their names are not included in such list.(5) That, except by permission of the Court, the evidence be given orally, and that the evidence and the arguments be heard in open Court.(6) That the witnesses be liable to cross-examination.(7) That a bare majority of the judges determine the decision of the Court as to guilt and sentence, except in case of liability to a death sentence, in which case the majority should consist of not less than two-thirds of those present.(8) That the judgment be given publicly by the Court as such, and that it should state the reasons upon which it is based.(9) That in fixing the punishment the Court may take into account extenuating circumstances.(10) That if the accused, having been duly cited, does not appear, the Court may proceed in his absence, and may give judgment upon the evidence at its disposal.(II) That the Court officially notify to the accused, so far as is practicable, the decision arrived at in his absence.(12) That the Full Court have power without re-hearing to revise any sentence passed by a Division of the International Tribunal, but subject to this power, the sentence passed by a Division shall take effect, unless within fourteen days from the passing thereof objection shall have been taken to any irregular-clarity in the proceedings. Such objection shall be heard and determined by the Full Court, and in the meantime the execution of the sentence shall be suspended.(13) Sentences to be imposed by the Court shall be carried into effect by such persons and in such manner as may be deter-mined by the Chief Allied States and the United States.VIII. Rules of Evidence to be Applied by the Tribunal.It is not considered desirable to offer any suggestion as to evidence; a matter which may safely be left to the Court which no doubt will take precautions to exclude irrelevant matter.It is obviously impossible to apply English rules of evidence to the proceedings of a Court the majority of the&apos;members of which may be unfamiliar with such rules.
IX. Charges to be preferred before the Tribunal.The enquiries of the Committee have not reached a stage at which it is possible to state precisely the charges which should be preferred against offenders. The Committee are still engaged in investigating these charges. Subject, therefore, to recon-sideration and modification the following heads of charges are provisionally suggested, viz.:  (1) Systematic Terrorism in Belgium, France and elsewhere.(2) Wanton Devastation, Destruction of Property, and Pillage.(3) Illegal Levies.(4) Illegal Executions.(5) Deportation of Civil Population in Occupied territories and Forced Labour. (6) Murder of Hostages.(7) Indiscriminate Bombardment from the Air. (8) Indiscriminate Bombardment from the Sea. (9) Illegal Methods of Submarine or other Naval Warfare. (10) Destruction of Hospital Ships. (11) Wilful or Reckless Bombardment of Hospitals. (12) Ill-Treatment of Prisoners of War. (13) Directions to give &quot; No Quarter.&quot; (14) Use of Illegal Methods of Warfare. The Committee desire to point out that if it be determined to bring before the Tribunal for trial persons who are responsible for the infringement of the Neutrality of Belgium or luxembourg -burg, or for commencing the war, it will be necessary that the Terms of Peace shall expressly provide for their surrender and trial, and their punishment, if they be found guilty of the act or acts with which they are charged, and that the provisions relative to disclosure of documents must be extended in order to cover such cases.These Recommendations cover a considerable portion of the matters referred to the Committee under the terms of their Reference. They deal with subjects upon which the enquiries of the Committee are still far from complete. In view, however, of the urgent necessity for despatch, the Committee have pre-sented the above Recommendations without stating their reasons, which will be submitted subsequently.In conclusion, the Committee desire to express their strong opinion that the Article or Articles in the Treaty of Peace pro-viding for jurisdiction over enemy offenders should, if possible, be drawn in the most comprehensive terms.Signed on behalf of the Committee,(Signed)    JOHN MACDONELL,Chairman,.J. H. MORGAN,Hugh H. L. Bellot,J. E. G. DE MONTMORENCY,19th December, 1918.Vice-Ghaswmom.ecretaries.14. The Committee now proceed to give their reasons for the above Recommendations.
isREASONS FOR RECOMMENDATIONS. Jurisdiction.15. The Committee are of opinion that the jurisdiction to try the offences referred to them should be based on the laws and usages of war as observed by civilised nations. Before stating these reasons for this conclusion, we may briefly mention some other suggested foundations for jurisdiction. They are, it seems to us, uncertain, insufficient or inapplicable. We name them only to show that they have not been overlooked..16. The terms of reference chiefly relate to offences committed against British subjects. These fall into four classes, according as they were committed (1) upon British territory (e.g, air-raids upon undefended towns); (2) in British territorial waters (e.g., the torpedoing of merchant ships without warning); (3) upon the High Seas in similar circumstances; and (4) upon foreign territory.Are these offences or any of them &quot;crimes&quot; according to English law? In other words, is there any Court which, by the laws of this country, has jurisdiction to try and punish the persons who have committed them?English Criminal Law.17. As to the first class, offences committed upon British territory by enemy subjects during a state of war, there are grave doubts whether they are triable at English Common Law. According to one view, all such offences are cognisable, while war exists, only by military tribunals. In support of this opinion is quoted the dictum of Hale :&quot; When it is tempus belli within the kingdom and one either steals, robs or plunders the house or goods of another . . . tho&apos; these kind of offences committed by those of the same party, or those that are net in hostility one to another, are felonies, yet in the time of war, when done by an enemy, they put on another name as acts of hostilities, misprision, and the like.&quot;*There is also the dictum of Coke (List., 4th part, 123), &quot;to the constable it appertaineth to have conusance of contracts and deeds of arms, and war out of the Kingdom, and also of things which touch war within the realm, which cannot be deter -mined or discussed by the Common Law.&quot; But such dicta, if strictly true, are, it is said, on the other hand, consistent with the doctrine that even in a state of war, when the ordinary Courts are open, they possess jurisdiction as to certain matters, e.g., when acts of violence are done by one of the belligerents not in accordance with, but contrary to, the laws and usages of war. At all events, the law as to this point is not expressly covered by authority and is uncertain.* Pleas of the Crown I. 565.
18. As to the second class of offences, those committed in British territorial waters, Section 2 of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878, provides that any offence on the high seas within one league of the coast, though committed in a foreign ship by a non-British subject, may be tried as if within the Admiralty juris-diction. The exact scope of this section has not, so far as we know, been judicially determined,* and its validity from the point of view of international law has been disputed by foreign writers, t The section appears to do no more than permit exercise of the Admiralty criminal jurisdiction within the three-mile zone. It does not contemplate acts done during a state of war, and affords no certain ground of jurisdiction.19. As to the third class of offences, acts committed on the high seas, the same observation applies the Admiralty criminal law dealt with offences committed in time of peace. Nor can such acts be regarded as acts of piracy, the essence of which is, that the wrongful acts are done without the authority of the State whose subject the pirate is or whose flag he flies. The acts of commissioned vessels are not piracy. As Hall remarks, &quot; most acts which become piratical through being done without authority, are acts of war when done under the authority of a state.&quot;X Even if the acts were those of non-commissioned vessels, those who committed them would not be triable as pirates if they were the subjects of a State at war with ue.g Cokell says, in effect, that, if the subjects of different States commit robbery upon each other upon the High Seas, if their respective States be at enmity it is not piracy, for it is a general rule that enemies can never commit piracy on each other, their depredations being deemed mere acts of hostility.20. The great majority of the acts which are the subject of our enquiry were committed on foreign territory by subjects of foreign States. Such wrongful acts were never offences at Com-mon Law, even in time of peace. When ex-territorial acts have been made punishable by statute, they have been held, on the principles laid down in R. v. Jameson^ and R. v. Keyn** to apply to the acts of British subjects and not to those of aliens.The conclusion to which, on the whole, we come is, that no English Court, administering the ordinary criminal law, would have jurisdiction to try an enemy alien in respect of any, or at all events of the great majority, of the offences in question.* See Stephens Criminal Law, II., pp. 17, 31; also Lord Cairns&apos;s Speech in introducing the measure, Hansard (1878), 237, p. 1601. t See Oppenheim, I, p. 260, referring to Perels, pp. 69-77. ;: International Law, p. 80.g As to definition of piracy, see Attorney General of Hongkong v. Kwoh a Sing^ L.R. 5, P.C. 199, 206 : also Sir L. Jenkins&apos;s charge at the Sessions of the Admiralty Jurisdiction of the Cinque Ports, I, LXXXVI.II Institutes, 4th Part, p. 154. &quot;f L.R.

21. There remains the question of Military jurisdiction, i.e., the jurisdiction exercised by Military Courts in virtue of their Statutory powers, such as the Army Annual Act, or that juris-diction which all armies in the field and in occupied territory assume in virtue of what the &quot; American. Instructions &quot; call &quot; the Common Law of War,&quot; or, to quote the title of The Hague Cbn-vention IV., &quot;The Laws and Usages of War.&quot;MILITARY LAW.22. As regards military law as exercised&apos;under Statutory powers, the Army Act is confined in its ex-territorial operation to mem-hers of the British armed forces and army followers. In this respect it differs from the Code de Justice Militaire and the Militar-Straf Gesetzbuch, which make statutory provision for punishing foreigners who commit offences against the national armies on foreign soil. The German Military Code, for example, Article 161, makes it an offence for any foreigner on foreign terri-tory to commit against German troops or any German authority an act which, if committed in German territory, would be punish-able by the laws of the German Empire, and in particular it applies to such cases the German statutory definition of &quot; war treason.&quot; These provisions, however, are not primarily con-cerned with breaches of the laws of war by enemy troops; they are mainly concerned with the inhabitants of occupied territory, &apos; and they only refer to members of the enemy forces in the case of espionage. Sections 63 and 64 of the French Military Code . give the French Military Courts jurisdiction over foreigners, whether within or without French territory, if they commit espionage, embauchage, and certain defined offences against the laws of war such as pillage, arson, and despoiling the wounded.* This would certainly cover some of the chief, though not all, of the offences which we have to consider.THE COMMON LAW OF WAR.23. There has always been a body of laws and usages, codified or uncodified, known as &quot; the laws of war,&quot; imposing limitations upon the use of violence. These usages might not always .be very clear; they were generally far from complete; and to some extent they varied from country to country and according to the humanity of individual commanders. Many of these tempera-menta belli originated with commanders desirous of maintaining discipline. The right of non-combatants to be unmolested was recognised by generals before it was declared by publicists, t Articles of war prepared by soldiers for soldiers,&apos; not drawn up in the interests of humanity, but intended to maintain* The French law of 24th July, 1913, has given effect to Article 28&quot; of the Geneva Convention of 1906 by modifying Articles 249 and 266. of the Code de Justice Militaire by making anyone liable (&quot; tout individu&quot; which, as Renault observes, covers foreigners, including enemy troops) who despoils the wounded, &amp;c, in the &quot; Zone d&apos;operations des forces militaires.&quot; M6righnac gives cases (cf. Revue generale du droit international public, Jan., 1917, p. 35) of French military tribunals punishing German soldiers during the present war for pillage, &amp;c..t See Bluntschli, Das Moderne Eriegsrecht, Art. 573.

Many manuals epitomising or explain-ing the effect of these articles were published.* Lord: Wood-houselee, Avho was a Judge of the Court of Sessions in Scot-land, and who had been Judge Advocate for that country, and had large experience of military law, in his learned work, &quot; An Essay on Military Law,&quot; refers to the opinion of Hale, C.J. (Pleas of the Crown, c. 10, 15), that aliens are in certain cases subject to, and punishable by, martial (i.e., military) law, and proceeds thus: &quot; It is allowed by every writer on the law of Nature and Nations, that although in general it is lawful in war to take all those means of annoying an enemy which nature and occasion afford, yet there are certain modes of hostile operations which the sentiments of all polished nations have agreed to repro-bate as contrary alike to good policy and morality, and, therefore, as evidencing a baseness and treachery which removes their perpetrators from the condition of ordinary enemies. When, therefore, such persons are reduced by the fortune of war to the state of prisoners, tFeir conduct may justify a measure of revenge or punishment beyond what is authorised to be inflicted on ordinary captives. It is not common to put to death prisoners of war. They are detained in safe custody till they are exchanged by cartel, for an equal number of our subjects who may be in the hands of the enemy, or till the conclusion of a peace restoring them to their liberty; and in the meantime they are treated with humanity. Such is the condition of ordinary captives. If, however, the subjects of a foreign Power engaged with us in warfare shall, either after a hostile invasion of the country, or clandestinely insinuating themselves into its bosom, employ themselves there in stirring up the subjects to treason or rebellion against the Sovereign or Government of the country, it is evident that such persons, when made prisoners, ought not to be considered as ordinary captives of war. There is no principle of justice that can condemn the forfeiture of the lives of such base and treacherous enemies; but as the human and liberal spirit of our constitution does not allow the taking away of life without a judicial sentence, so it is customary to subject such persons, though aliens (and as such in general not amenable to our laws), to trial by court martial; when the facts being substantiated by proof, that sentence is awarded which is justly due to the atrocity of the crime, &quot;tThese laws and usages were at first confined to particular countries or armies. But in course of time, and no doubt, owing, in some degree, to the influence of Grotius and other writers, they became generally known and accepted among civi-lised States, though conformity to them was very imperfect.Among the first attempts to codify and reduce them to writing was that made by Dr. Lieber in his &quot;Instructions for the
Government of the United States Armies in the Meld,&quot; issued in 1863 and re-issued in 1898. A subsequent attempt was ma;de in Brussels in 1874, and in 1899 and .1907 many of these laws and usages were incorporated in The Hague Conventions.Before these Conventions were adopted, infractions of such laws and usages were punished by reprisals against the offending belligerent State or by the punishment of individual offenders, if captured, of whatever rank, and whether or not a subject of one belligerent State or the other. In early times the offender was often dealt with promptly and summarily. But the modern procedure has been to bring him before a Military Court, which administers the laws and usages of war against its own subjects or the subjects of its adversary. For centuries individual offenders against such laws and usages have been tried and punished by the Military Courts of the offended State, whenever they have come within its jurisdiction or power.*24. It is true that The Hague Conventions nowhere prescribe punishment for breaches of the laws of war. But the well-known usages as to punishment are not abrogated; and they are implied in the Regulations annexed lo Convention II. of 1899 and Convention IV. of 1907.As late as 1880 the Institute of International Law accepted the principle that a belligerent is entitled to punish by such laws as he prescribes violations of the laws of war.fEffect of the Conclusion of Peace.25. In applying such laws said usages a difficulty might arise if, before or after trial, peace was concluded. Instances of trial or punishment after such conclusion are not numerous. When hostilities are ended there has usually been a general feeling to let bygones be bygones. This feeling has often found expression in a general amnesty provision inserted in Treaties of Peace, which signifies an immunity or exemption from prosecution of, or other interference with, the members of the armed forces of belligerents or their respective subjects for acts committed by them during the war. But there is no reason why an amnesty clause should not contain an exception as to the trial and punish-ment after the conclusion of peace of the subjects of one belligerent by the other belligerent for acts contrary to the laws and customs of war.- *.See the Black Book of the Admiralty (1,282). The ordinances there printed prohibit on pain of death robbing churches.and &quot; enforcing women &quot; (s. 3). See also instructions as to what the Admiral is to do in time of war at sea or land (1.25). No pillage after peace is permitted. Tytler&apos;s &quot; Essay on Military.

26. An example of such an amnesty clause is contained in the terms of Peace offered by Sir Evelyn Wood and accepted by the Boers after Majuba, and ratified by the British Government on March 22nd, 1881.* Art. 1 provided &quot; Complete amnesty to all, including the leaders, except to persons who had committed acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare.&quot; The representa-tives of the Boers also agreed in the terms of peace to &quot; gladly co-operate with Her Majesty&apos;s Government in bringing to justice those who had committed or were directly responsible for acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare.&quot;By Art. 5 of the Convention of Pretoria, of 3rd August, 1881, it was provided that &quot; All sentences passed upon persons who may be convicted of offences contrary to the rules of civilized warfare, committed during the recent hostilities will be duly carried out, and no alteration or mitigation of such sentences will be made or allowed by the Government of the Transvaal State without Her Majesty&apos;s consent, conveyed through the British Resident.&quot;A number of persons accused of breaches of the laws of war were under this Convention brought to trial before the High Court of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.t27. A more recent example of an exception in an amnesty clause is to be found in the Treaty of Peace of Vereeniging, May 31st, 1902. It provided that all burghers who surrendered and accepted the position of British subjects, would be protected in their person and property and that &quot; no proceedings, civil or criminal,&quot; would be taken against them &quot; for any acts in con-nection with the prosecution of the war &quot; (Art. IV.). The benefit, however, of this clause was not to extend to certain acts contrary to the usages of war which had been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals.   These offences were* The British Government had on Feb. 8th directed General Colley to inform President Brand that H.M. Government would give all reasonable guarantees not to treat the Boers as rebels.f Among such cases were ; that of Captain Elliot, reported to have been shot by an escort of Boers, while attempting to cross the Vaal river ;The case of William Finlay, who it was reported, having with others been tried and found guilty at Potchefstroom by a Court-Martial on a charge of violence against the South African Republic, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with hard labour, and was sent with others under the term of imprisonment to work in the trenches exposed to the fire of the British Garrison at Potchefstroom, and while so working was killed by a shell;The case of Andrew Malcolm, reported to have been beaten or kicked to death by Boers in a store between Pretoria and Potchefstroom ;Some of those accused of having committed acts contrary to the rules of civilized warfare were brought to trial, whilst others, as to whom there was suspicion or evidence, were not charged as it was found under the circumstances undesirable to insist on prosecution.Two of those accused of the murder of Captain Elliot were tried before the High Court of the Transvaal at Pretoria, and two of those accused of the murder of Mr. Barber were tried before the High Court of the Orange Free State.In the case of Andrew Malcolm, the accused was brought to trial before the High Court&apos; at Pretoria upon a charge of ordinary murder.In all of these cases the accused were acquitted by the Jury.* Parl. Papers, 1882 [c. 3114], pp. 23-25.
to be tried by Court-Martial immediately after the close of hostilities-ties. Under tbis clause a Boer officer was tried by a Military Court at Heidelberg on June 10th, 1902, for an abuse of the white flag and was condemned to death.*28. Another precedent is furnished during the American Civil War. A German, named Henry Wirtz, who held a commission in the Confederate Government, was in charge of the prison at Andersonville. In violation of the laws of war, he caused many of the prisoners there detained to be killed. After the Declara-tion of Peace he was arrested and tried on charges stated below before a military commission at Washington on August 23rd, 1865.t He was defended by counsel, found guilty, condemned to death and executed.29. In referring to these examples from South Africa, we have not overlooked the fact that these agreements were made by the British Government with persons whom it claimed to be its subjects or under its suzerainty. In Wirtz&apos;s case, it may be observed, that the accused was in law a subject of the United States, though at the time of the acts committed he was in the* Wyman&apos;8 Army Debates, 1902, Vol. 2, p 1051.f Wirtz was charged with : (1) &quot; Maliciously, wilfully and traitorously, and in aid of the existing armed rebellion against the United States of America on or before the 1st day of March, A.D. 1864, and on divers other occasions between that day and the 10th day of April, 1865, combining, confederating and conspiring, together with John H. Winder, Richard B. Winder, Joseph (Isiah h.) White, W. S. Winder, R. R. Stevenson and others unknown, to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the Military Service of the United States, then held and being prisoners of War within the lines of the so-called Confederate States, and in the Military prisons thereof, to the end that the Armies of the United States might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war.&quot;The following were counts or &quot; specifications&quot; in the above charges, viz.: &quot; unhealthy and unwholesome quarters-neglect to furnish tents, barracks or other shelter  taking from prisoners clothing, blankets, camp equipage and other property unwholesome food unwholesome water-establishing a &apos; dead line&apos; and instructing the prison guard to shoot any who crossed the &apos; dead line,&apos; &amp;c.&quot;(2) &quot; Murder in violation of the laws and customs of war &quot; ; the specifically -cations including  &quot; Shooting a man with a pistol.&quot; &quot; Kicking a prisoner so that he died.&quot; &quot; Shooting a prisoner with a pistol.&quot; &quot; Putting a prisoner in the stocks and causing death.&quot; Upon the first charge Wirtz was found guilty in that he combined, etc. &quot; in violation of the laws of war, to impair and injure the health and to destroy the lives by subjecting to torture and great suffering ; by confining in unhealthy and unwholesome quarters ; by exposing to the inclemency of the winter and to the dews and burning sun of summer; by compelling the use of impure water and by furnishing insufficient and unwholesome food, of large numbers of Federal troops, to wit, the number of about 45,000 soldiers  .  .  .  held as prisoners of war at Andersonville.&quot;.Upon the second charge Wirtz was found guilty of the murder of prisoners of war upon the counts above mentioned and in addition of causing the deaths of three prisoners &quot; by means of dogs.&quot; &quot; The War of the Rebellion,&quot; compiled under the direction of the Secretary of War.

service of the Confederate Government, then recognised as a belligerentsWirtz was exempted under the Sixth Exception to the Presi-dentfs Proclamation of Amnesty of 29th May, 1865, viz:  &apos;&apos; All who have engaged in any way in treating, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, persons found in the United States service as officers, soldiers, seamen or in other capacities.&quot;30. The Committee are of opinion that it would be in accord-ance with the principles of the laws and usages of war, as hitherto understood among civilised people to bring to trial, while a state of war exists, persons of whatever rank, captured or surrendered, charged on credible evidence with committing breaches of such laws and usages. In order to maintain clearly such jurisdiction after the conclusion of Peace it seems necessary, however, that in the Treaty of Peace or other arrangement with the State of which the offenders are subjects, there should be express recog-nition of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal before which they are to be brought.31. The creation of a Special Court after the conclusion of Peace for the trial of offences committed during war is not wholly without precedent. But none of the precedents exactly cover the present case. If the persons who ordered or sanc-tioned breaches of the laws of war by the Central Powers and their Allies as well as the actual perpetrators are to be brought to trial, it seems to the Committee that the Chief Allied Powers and the United States must accept fully and without reserve the responsibility of creating a tribunal of a novel character such as they think appropriate for that purpose and of clothing it with adequate powers.Constitution of the Tribunal.32. As to the Constitution of the Tribunal two courses seem to the Committee to be open: -r(1) The establishment of an International Tribunal on which all&apos;the leading&apos;Allied Powers and the United States should be represented; or(2) The creation of purely national Courts appointed by each of the chief Allied Powers and the United States for the trial of offences committed against their respec-tive subjects.The advantages of the former course are the greater moral weight attaching to the opinions and acts of such a Tribunal; the fact that it would be the mouthpiece of the united&apos; voice of the Associated Governments upon the questions involved; that all* The Confederates had been recognised as belligerents by the Supreme Court (see Moore&apos;s Digest of Intern. Law, I, 190). See Winthrop&apos;s Military Law and Precedents II., 1295-6, where he says : &quot; The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to define and punish offences against the laws of nations,&quot; in virtue of which military commissions were set up.  Cf. pp. 1304-5.
the offenders would be dealt with by an International body; that such a Tribunal would afford security against decisions of different character or punishments of varying degrees of severity being inflicted for similar acts; that duplication of trials of the persons guilty of outrages against the subjects of different nationalities might be avoided; and that such a Tribunal would be better suited than a National Tribunal for the trial of high officials, naval or military, responsible for the employment of methods of warfare by which all Allied Powers were affected.Against this course it is urged that in order to constitute such a Tribunal difficult negotiations would necessarily take place involving delay and possibly differences of opinion between the States concerned.The decisions as to what States should be represented and to what extent on the Tribunal, and what should be the manner of procedure would also give rise to differences of opinion.33. It is obviously impossible that such a Tribunal could try a large number of individual cases. Sections or divisions would have to be constituted, and delay and difficulty would arise as to the constitution, procedure and scope of each of such sections. In the meantime offenders might disappear, some of the evidence might possibly be no longer forthcoming; and questions, whicli ought to be settled and disposed of promptly, might be kept open for a long period. The moral effect of any decisions given and punishments inflicted would be less after a lapse of time.The Committee, after weighing these arguments, have by a majority come to the conclusion that the preferable course would be the establishment of an International Tribunal constituted in the manner suggested in their recommendations.34. The Committee have considered the question whether there should be on the Tribunal representatives of neutral States. The Committee recognise the advantages attaching to the pre-senoe of such representatives; they would lend, it might be said, to the Tribunal a more distinct International character. There are, however, as it seems to us, decisive objections to their ad-mission. The Committee cannot ignore for instance the fact that in all probability, having regard to ethnical, economic and geographical factors, the representatives of certain of the neutral States might not be free from pressure or apprehension of pres-sure. In the course of the war, it may be added, those States which most distinctly represented neutral interests, or which took steps to assert the rights of neutrals, became belligerents.The Law to be Applied by the Tribunal.35. The Law to be applied by the Tribunal should be based upon &quot; the principles of the law of nations as they result from the usages,established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience,&quot; to use the words contained in the preamble to Convention IV. of The Hague Conference, 1907.These laws and customs are contained in such ancient collec-tions as the Consolato del Mare, in Treaties, Conventions and . &quot;Declarations; the decisions of Prize Courts and of naval and
military courts-martial, and of civil courts; naval codes and regulations; military manuals and rules for land warfare; Statutes, Orders in Council, Decrees and Ordinances and un-written usages.36. Some of these laws and usages have been embodied in the Conventions of The Hague Conferences and Declarations of 1899 and 1907. At these Conferences it was found impossible to frame regulations covering all the questions arising in the conduct of war, and no attempt to produce an. exhaustive code of rules was made. The contracting parties expressly stated in Conven-tion II., 1899, that it was not intended &quot; that cases not provided for should, for want of a written provision, be left to the arbitrary judgment of military commanders.&quot;37. It has been contended by the German Government since the commencement of the war that the Conventions of The Hague Conference, 1907, could not be applied to the conduct of hostilities-ties, since all the belligerents had not ratified them. This contention would appear to be well-founded. The laws and customs of land warfare are dealt with in Convention II. of 1899 and in Convention IV. of 1907.38. By Art. 1 of Convention II., 1899, and Convention TV., 1907, the contracting Powers agreed to issue instructions to their armed forces in the field framed in conformity with the Regula-tions respecting the laws and customs of war on land annexed to the respective Conventions. By Art. 2 of Convention IV., 1907, it was agreed that the provisions contained in these Regulations, as well as those contained in Convention IV., 1907, should not apply except betweenthe contracting Powers, and then only if all the belligerents were parties to the Convention.39. By Art. 4 of Convention IV., 1907, it was agreed that Convention IV., when ratified, should, as between the contract-ing Powers, be substituted for the Convention II., 1899. It was further agreed that the Conventions of 1899 should remain &quot; in force as between the Powers which signed it&quot; and which did not also ratify Convention IV., 1907.Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Serbia signed but did not ratify Convention IV., 1907.The Committee are of opinion that the Convention of 1899 is applicable, since to this Convention all the belligerent States were parties. All signed and ratified, or subsequently adhered to, it. By Art. 2 of Convention II., 1899, it was agreed that the pro-visions contained in the Regulations were only to be binding on the contracting Powers in case of war between two or more of them, and it was further agreed that these provisions^ should cease to be binding when in a war between contracting Powers a non-oontracting Power joined one of the belligerents. All the belligerents having signed the Convention or subsequently adhered to it, and no non-contracting Power having joined any of the belligerents, this Convention would appear to apply to the con-duct of the war. .JBy Art. 25 of Convention X., 1907, it was agreed that Con. vention III., 1899, relating to the Geneva Convention, 1864, should remain in force as between the Powers which signed it
but which did not also ratify Convention X., 1907. Consequently Convention III., 1899, also would appear to be applicable in the present war.*40. It cannot be too strongly urged that, whether these Con-ventions and Declarations have been ratified or not, they are to a very large extent merely declaratory of existing laws and usages.Superior Orders.41. The Committee have devoted considerable attention to the question whether an accused person can plead superior orders either in bar of his trial or as a mitigation of his offence. They are of opinion that no person should be punished for the corn-mission of an act which he did not know to be forbidden or which he could not reasonably be expected to know to be unlawful. They recognise the fact that military discipline requires that members of the armed forces of a State should obey the commands of their superiors, and that such discipline also requires that those who execute such commands should do so with a knowledge that they will be immune from punishment for so doing. The Committee cannot, however, accept the doctrine that it is the duty, of a sailor or soldier never to question an order which he receives.! They consider that, if the act constituting the offence charged was done in obedience to the order of a superior, this should be treated as primd facie a defence, but that such defence might be displaced by proof:  (a) That the order did not relate to a military duty.(6) That the act charged was in excess of and not covered by the order given.(c) That the act charged was flagrantly and obviously. contrary to the laws and customs of war and of humanity.(d) That there were circumstances from which knowledgeof the illegality of the order could be imputed to the accused.(e) That it was an order in regard to the execution of whichthe accused had a discretion.If the plea of superior orders does not succeed as a defence, it may still be relevant as a circumstance to be considered in mitigation of punishment.* Declaration IV., 2, of 1899, whereby the contracting Powers agreed to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases, was declared only binding on the contracting Powers in the case of a war between two or more of them. It was further declared that the Declaration should cease to be binding from the time when, in a war between the contracting Powers, one of the belligerents should be joined by a non-contracting Power. Brazil, Cuba and the United States,, did not ratify or adhere to the Declaration. Consequently upon the-entry of -Brazil and Cuba into the war as allies of the United States, the Declaration ceased to apply.f In the opinion of the Committee, the statement to the contrary effect in Chapter XIV., para. 4?3 of the Manual of Military Law lacVs authority.
Procedure.42. There are at present, broadly stated, two types of Criminal Procedure, the Anglo-American and the French; the former based upon the accusatory principle, the latter originally upon the inquisitorial. It is suggested that neither should be strictly adhered to. The procedure ought to be as simple as possible. The proceedings should be public and mainly oral, and witnesses should be liable to examination and cross-examination. The accused should be entitled to the assistance of counsel.The Committee have not deemed it necessary or proper to frame a complete code of rules of procedure, but have merely suggested certain principles, the observance of which would fully ensure justice to the accused.43. No suggestion is made as to any appeal or revision of the judgment or sentence. Nor does such seem necessary, having regard to the size of the Tribunal and the nature of the procedure above described, with its safeguards for fair play. But it might be advisable to stipulate that the Pull Court might, in its dis-cretion, re-consider or revise any of the sentences of a Division of the Court. . v   -Evidence.44. Having considered the advantages or disadvantages of the rules of evidence, as understood by English and by Erench Courts, we have come to the conclusion that the matter should be left to the discretion of the Tribunal.The Ex-Kaiser&apos;s Position.45. In regard to the proceedings against the ex-Kaiser, the Committee are of opinion that little aid can be derived from pre-cedents.The case is unique; and it behoves the States chiefly concerned to act in accordance with what seems to them in the circum-stances just and proper, having in view the effect of their action on international law and the future conduct of war. While there is no exact precedent for punishment, there is also no exact precedent in modern times for a series of crimes brought about by a group of men of whom the ex-Kaiser was one. To suffer him (if responsible for grave offences against the laws and usages of war) to go free and unpunished, while minor offenders acting under his orders, or with his sanction, were tried and punished, would be inequitable. He would be more favourably dealt with than others much less blameable.: 46. Assuming that he is to be (dealt with, two courses might be taken he might be treated summarily and administratively without any.trial, in much the same manner as Napoleon was dealt with in 1815, or he might be tried before a Tribunal such as has been suggested above. One of several objections *tb&quot; the former mode of treatment is that it would slur over notable dif-ferences between the two cases. Napoleon was not charged with having during the Hundred Days carried on war contrary to the usages of civilised nations.   His offence, if any, was either
that he was a rebel to the lawful French Government or that he had violated the arrangement agreed to by him in 1814.* The moral effect of confinement or internment of the ex-Kaiser without a trial would be much less than that of proceedings in which he would be heard and, if found guilty, punished accordingly.The opinion of the majority of the members of the Committee on the whole is in favour of the second course.Ex-Kaiser&apos;s Constitutional Position.47. By Art. 18 of the Constitution the Emperor shall appoint Imperial officials and cause them to take the oath to the Empire and dismiss them when necessary.    *By Art. 53 the Navy of the Empire shall form a unity under the supreme command of the Emperor. The Emperor is charged with its organisation and composition; he shall appoint the officers and officials of the navy; and they and the seamen shall take an oath of obedience to him.By Art. 63. The total land forces of the Empire shall form one army; it shall be under the command of the Emperor in war and in peace.By Art. 64. All German troops are bound to render uncon-ditional obedience to the commands of the Emperor. This obli-gation shall be included in the military oath.48. In the Reports of the Sub-Committees for Offences on Land and at Sea an account will be found of the organisation of the German army and navy and the actual part which the ex-Kaiser took in their administration. There is evidence that he in fact exercised his large constitutional powers, and was in truth &quot; War Lord.&quot; In the same Reports there are grounds for an. opinion that a primd facie case can be established against him for respon-sibility for certain crimes. The Committee are unable to see any reason in principle, for excluding responsibility.t Is,it to cease with the Generals in the field? Ought.it not to extend to those, however highly placed, who directed a system under which such crimes were committed ? It seems impossible to distinguish between his responsibility and that of other commanders; if any, difference exists between them it is not one in his favour. If the ex-Kaiser were surrendered by the Dutch Government to the, Allies, or to any of them, it seems incontestable that he could be tried by a court-martial or some modi-fication of it under military law for offences contrary to the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity, committed by him or under his, orders or with his complicity as, head of the army For l;his-proposition no authority can he cited; but sub-ject to theiohjection to, be considered later based, upon his; positionee-TwiEB&apos;8 Life of Lord Eldon II, 270; alto Hansard (1816), VoL 33 pp. 1012-1020,1059-1064.t This aspect of the subject is more fully discussed in Sect.

as a sovereign, no authority would seem to be necessary, assuming-ing his complicity in illegal acts.If he were surrendered after peace there seems no reason in principle why he should not be tried by a Tribunal set up under a Treaty expressly providing for the recognition of its jurisdiction.49. It has been urged that the ex-Kaiser, being a Sovereign at the time when the offences charged against him were com-mitted, is and was exempt from the jurisdiction of any Tribunal. This question has rarely been discussed in modern times. Indeed, since the trial of Mary Queen of Scots, and perhaps it may be added, the murder by Queen Christian of Sweden of her chamber-lain Monaldeschi at Fontainebieau, it has possessed only an academic interests In a note are collected the opinions of some of the chief text-writers who have touched the subject, t For the most part they do not distinguish between the position of a Sovereign who visits or resides in a foreign country at the invitation-tation or by the permission, express or implied, of its Sovereign, and that of a Sovereign who invades and occupies foreign terri-tory. in spite of the resistance of its Sovereign. For immunity /in the latter case there seems to be no authority. Ancient prac-tice was against it. Francis I. was imprisoned after the battle of Pavia.. No modern usage establishing such immunity appears to exist. In recent times sovereigns have been made prisoners of war, e.g., Napoleon III. in .1870 and the Elector of Hesse in 1866.% The German Manual of Military Law includes sovereigns among possible prisoners of war; and there seems no reason why, if. captured, they should not be treated according- as they have or have not violated the laws of war.Signed on behalf of the Committee,Alleged Immunity of the Ex-Kaiser.(Signed)(Signed)Hugh H.

NOTE ON IMMUNITY OE SOVEREIGNS.By Sir John Macdonell, K.C.B.While the subject of the immunity of sovereigns from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of foreign Courts has been much dis-cussed by writers on international law, and certain well-known rules are generally accepted, the precise point mentioned in the &quot; Reasons &quot;* has rarely been in modern times considered. Most writers have either omitted mentioning it, or have used ambiguous language. They have, as a rule, confined their attention to immunity of sovereigns from the jurisdiction of Courts of foreign territories in which they do not reside or in which they are present by invitation or permission, express or implied.The point was discussed at length with reference to Mary Queen of Scots, who on her trial pleaded, without success, her rights as a sovereign in answer to the charges against her. In the course of the trial, Sir Christopher Hatton, one of the Com-missioners, remarked: &quot; You say you are a queen; be it so. But in such a crime the royal dignity is not exempted from answering neither by the civil nor canon law, nor by the law of nations.&quot;! Such was the opinion of the other Commissioners.there is a critical discussion of this plea in Ward&apos;s Enquiry into the Law of Nations. $ While expressing no opinion upon the point, he remarks that &quot; it must be owned that whatever may be supposed to have been decided at the time concerning the deposition or the sovereignty of Mary the Ministers and lawyers of England held in the most decided terms that a sovereign acknowledged as such&quot; and residing freely within the territory of another was liable to be punished for treason by the Courts of the land.&quot;II Mr. Ward adds: &quot; there is at least no case in the history of the world by which to support the general discussion, &quot;fA similar point, was raised, but not decided, with reference to the murder of Monaldeschi by the Queen of Sweden while resid-ing in France. The common opinion on that crime is probably expressed by Hallam:** &quot;Whatever be the privilege of in-violability attached to sovereigns, it must, on every rational ground, be confined to those who enjoy and exercise dominion in some independent territory. An abdicated or dethroned monarch may preserve his title by the courtesy of other States, but cannot rank with sovereigns in the tribunals where public law is ad-ministered. I should be ratfier surprised to hear any one assert that the Parliament of Paris was incompetent to try Christina for the murder of Monaldeschi.&quot;* p. 31. f I- State Trials, 117.% See Strype&apos;s Annals of the Reformation, III., part I., p. 523.8 II., p. 564. I II., p. 593. fH., p. 599.  Also I., 279,** Constitutional History, I., p. 218, 3rd ed.
Probably the opinions of writers on the subject may be thus classified:(1) Those who state the ancient usage of war as to vanquishedsovereigns in all its severity; (2) those who, like Albericus Gentilis, urge the desirabilityof exercising moderation and magnanimity in carry-ing out such usage or rights in regard to defeatedKings and generals; (3) those who, especially about the time of Louis XIV.,seek to exalt the sacrosanct character of the sovereign ; (4) those recent writers who use comprehensive language asto such immunity without having in mind the exactpoint mentioned in the text. It had been the ancient practice to treat with severity leaiders of defeated armies; but on the part of the theoretical writers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there was a desire to humanise warfare, especially as to the treatment of prisoners. For example, Albericus Gentilis, * in a chapter entitled &quot; de ducibus hostium captis,&quot; enumerates many examples of Kings who make war being killed or enslaved by their captors. But he pleads for the exercise of humanity towards captured Princes, &quot; nisi causoB speciales caedem pro-bent.&quot; Grotius knows nothing of the special immunity of Kings taken prisoners in war; indeed he cites examples of commanders being put to death. He argues for moderation in the punishment of the vanquished, and enu-merates certain classes (e.g., women and children, etc.) which ought to be spared; he does not specially name sovereigns. Zouchet mentions the case of Queen Mary, and he discusses the question whether a prince has sovereignty over another prince in his own territory, but he gives no answer. The same writer]: remarks: &quot; Et si cum in territorio principis in quern con-jurarunt deprehensi sunt, prsesenti vindicta uti melius videbitur; juri gentium convenit pro hostibus declarare, unde, hon expectato judicio, cuivis eos interficere impune liceat.&quot;Bynkershoek, % discussing the subject in a passage quoted by Phillimorell (II. 138n), recommends summary action in the case of a foreign sovereign causing internal troubles; but the precise point named in the text is not dealt with, very definitely.He refers to the analogy of ambassadors. He denies that there is any usage on the subject, as to the sovereign who commits crimes in foreign territory. &quot; Poterit utique cletineri, forte et occludi, quamvis per turban malim, quam constitute judicio.&quot;Puffendorf does not mention the complete immunity of sove-reigns. VattelH touches this question and praises the humanity of those who in war spared the person of the king. He adds, &quot;Mais ce n&apos;est point une loi de guerre d&apos;epargner en toute recontre la personne du roi ennemi; et on n&apos;y oblige que quand on a la facilite de le faire prisonnier.&quot;* de Jure Belli, III., c. 8.f Juris et Judieii fecialis, sec II., qu 6.j Solut QuaesL, cited by Ward II., 590.

Les souverains des puissances belligerentes ne se regardent point, eux-memes, ni les membres de leur families respectives, comme ennemis du moins quand aux dehors. . . . S&apos;ils sont faits prisonniers, ils sont ou relaches a 1&apos;instant, ou&apos; traites avec des egards particuliers.&quot;Wildmant while stating that a foreign sovereign who enters territory with the knowledge or licence of its sovereign is by universal usage of civilised nations exempt from jurisdiction, arrest or detention, adds, &quot; should one sovereign enter the terri-tories of another without his consent, express or implied, it would present a question which does not seem to be perfectly settled.&quot;JThe matter is thus dealt with by Phillimoreg : &quot; With respect to Criminal Jurisdiction the foreign sovereign, as a general pro-position, is exempt from it. Extreme cases may be put which would make the rule inapplicable. If, indeed, he should abuse the hospitality of the kingdom, he may be ordered, like a delinquent ambassador, to depart from it without delay. If he should contrive or perpetrate any offence against the welfare&apos; or laws of the country in which he is a guest, International Law would warrant the authorities of that country in preventing the commission of the offence, by placing him under necessary re-straint, and in subsequently demanding satisfaction for the injury at the hands of the country of this delinquent representative. We may go a step further, and say, that his act of violence may be met by violence, and that if he perish in consequence of the resistance opposed to his unlawful conduct, no maxim of Inter-national Law is violated. But may the delinquent sovereign, under any circumstances, be rendered amenable to the criminal jurisdiction of a foreign country? It is difficult in a treatise on law to answer a question which is founded upon the supposition that the representatives of the majesty of the law are the criminals to be tried by the law. If, however, the question must receive a categorical answer, the answer must be in the negative. The historical precedents which might appear to countenance a oon-trary opinion are valueless. Nihil igitur in hoc argumento pro-ficies rebus sirrdliter a gentibus judicatis is the just observation of Bynkershoek. It is obvious, moreover, that this class of cases is happily so rare and the instances cited are so exceptional in their nature, both from their own circumstances and from the periods of history in which they happened, that International Law cannot rely upon them as exponents of usage in this arduous matter, but must guide the enquirer by the reason of the thing applied to the exigency of each particular occurrence. Interna-tional Law, like the Civil Law, must pass by without attempting* Droit des Gens modernes de V Europe, a. 245.f Institutes of International Law, I., 42.% I., 42, 43.5 II., p. 137.
20962to bring under exact rules anomalies which a sudden emergency may create, or to provide beforehand for all imaginable eon-contingencies.&quot;It is difficult to understand why Phillimore arrives at a con-clusion adverse to such jurisdiction, if, indeed, he arrives at any conclusion. If exemption exists, it must be derived from express agreement, or implied from usage; and none, it is admitted, exists.Wheaton,* one of the latest writers who has touched the sub-ject, says that the foreign sovereign &quot;is not amenable to the civil or criminal jurisdiction of the country where he temporarily resides.&quot; But he adds (p. 193): &quot; Should one sovereign enter the territory of another without the consent of their order, expressed or implied, it would present a question which did not appear to be perfectly settled.&quot;Later writersf express themselves in general terms as to the immunity of the foreign sovereigns. But they do not deal with the point in question.The true ground of the well-known exemptions of foreign sovereigns from local jurisdiction is stated by Marshall, C.J., in &quot; The Exchange&quot;: &quot;A foreign sovereign is not understood as intending to subject himself to a jurisdiction incompatible with his dignity and the dignity of his nation, and it is to avoid this subjection that the licence has been obtained. The character to whom it is given, and the object for which it is granted, equally required that it should be construed to impart full security to the person who has obtained it. This security, however, need not be expressed; it is implied from the circumstances of the case. Should one sovereign enter the territory of another without the consent of the other, expressed or implied, it would present a question which does not appear to be perfectly settled, a decision of which is not necessary to any conclusion to which the Court may come in the cause under consideration. If he did not thereby expose himself to the territorial jurisdiction of the sovereign whose dominions he had entered, it would seem to be because all sovereigns impliedly engage not to avail themselves of a power over their equals which a romantic confidence in their magnanimity has placed in their hands.&quot;   (137-138.)The cases of Murat and the Emperor Maximilian, both of whom were tried by court-martial and executed, prove little. The former was not de facto sovereign, and the execution of the latter occurred in a country where the usages of civilized warfare were imperfectly observed.The result of an examination of the authorities, if such can be said to exist, would seem to be that there is no rule or usage exempting from criminal jurisdiction foreign sovereigns who have invaded the territory of another sovereign.* Ed. by Lawrence, p. 188.t E-ff; Calvo (VI., s. 2849), Bonfils (s. 641), Hall (s. 49).

THE PLEA OF SUPERIOR ORDERS, By Professor J. H. Morgan,Introductory, I. English Law. II. English Military Law.III. German Law.IV. French Law.V. International Law,VI. The scale of responsibility-the position of the ex-Kaiser. VII. Conclusion,Note, This paper is a memorandum submitted to the Sub-Committee on Law by Professor Morgan,THE PLEA OF SUPERIOR ORDERS.The question of the extent to which superior orders can be pleaded as an excuse for a breach of the law is one which has never received any authoritative interpretation, so far as offences against the laws and customs of war are concerned.   In English law we have nothing to guide us except the decisions of the courts as to what a soldier may or may not do in regard to persons who are within the King&apos;s peace for example, the degree of force he is justified in using in order to suppress a civil disturbance or rebellion.   Upon the kind of force he may exercise against enemies and it must be remembered that in English law a rebel has never the status of an &quot; enemy &quot; there is not a single decision.   Civil war is one thing&quot;; foreign war, or war in the international sense, is quite another. *   All the tests to which the courts subject the conduct of soldiers in the first case are more or less irrelevant when we come to the second.   &quot; Soldiers,&quot; we have been told by Lord Bowen in his Report on the Featherstone riots, are &quot; only civilians armed in a particular manner &quot;; but to apply this description to soldiers in the field would be no less false than ludicrous.   The soldier who, when made a prisoner of war, pleaded that he was only a civilian armed in a particular manner would get short shrift from the enemy forces.    The degree of obedience required of the soldier in the first case is always limited by his duty to avoid a breach of the common law; no such duty exists in the second case, for the common law does not run in the field least of all in regard to the King&apos;s enemies. The legislature has recognised the distinction to the extent of insisting on the more imperative character of a command given in time of war by distinguishing between the penalties which attach to disobedience to a command in time of peace and on active service.   Mere disobedience to a &quot; lawful command &quot;t. is punishable when on active service^ with penal servitude; when* Unless otherwise indicated I have used the term &quot; war &quot; throughout in its international sense, i.e., a war with a foreign country. T Army Act, sec. 9 (2).I Army Act, *ec. 189 (1) defines active service as equivalent to service against the enemy, including military occupation of a foreign country. In other words it refers to war in the international sense,/
not on active service with imprisonment. As to the meaning of the word &quot;lawful &quot; I will say something in a moment, merely remarking here that, while it obviously includes a command which is lawful at common law during a state of affairs falling short of war, it is not obvious .that the command is to be subject to the same test of lawfulness when war is declared.&apos; &apos; I. &apos; English Law.Now, it is a commonplace of English writers that in time of peace a soldier who obeys, a command, the execution of which results in a breach of the law, is as liable to answer for his acts as a civilian acting under the persuasion of another.* This is approximately true, but it must be remembered that to establish guilt it is always necessary to prove the existence of that guilty mind known to lawyers as mens rea, and the catena of acts and intents necessary to establish it would rarely co-exist in the same way in the case of a civilian and a soldier. The military duty of a soldier to obey orders implicitly would probably be taken into account in a court of common law in the case of a soldier obeying them. It would appear that unless the orders were manifestly illegal, the presumption of absence of guilty mind will be stronger in his case than in that of a civilian. There is autho-rity for this.f Too much has been made of the poignancy of the soldier&apos;s dilemma in being subject to two conflicting jurisdictions, and the epigram which attempts to sharpen that dilemma in the words &quot; he is liable to be hanged if he obeys an order and shot if he does not obey it&quot; is, like most epigrams, inaccurate. A soldier who refused to fire on a crowd of innocent spectators in time of peace or civil disturbance would not, unless his dis-obedience amounted to &quot;wilful defiance&quot; of military authority, be even nominally liable to be shot; the highest military penalty he would incur would be imprisonment. Thus the degree of duress under which a soldier acts in obeying an order in time of peace or civil disturbance is appreciably less coercive than that which is exercised upon him in time of war, there being, as will .be seen in a moment, no limits in the latter case. He is therefore in a. position to exercise a far greater degree of discretion in dis-criminating as to the lawfulness of orders in time of peace or civil strife. Epigrams will not help us to resolve the question, and if the soldier has his dilemmas, so has the civil magistrate. The Mayor of Bristol, whose infirmity of will is notorious in our law reports, may have reflected that if he had ordered the soldiers to fire on the crowd he might be hanged, and that if he did not give the order, he might, as indeed he was, be indicted for a misdemeanour.* i have discussed this question more fully in an article under the title of &quot; The Army and the Civil Power&quot; which appeared in the Nineteenth Century for May, 1914, and in &quot; War, its Conduct and Legal Pteaults.&quot;f Cf., R. V. Smith (for which see below): &quot; That he is responsible whenever he obeys sn order is a view which the Court cannot accept.&quot;
Let us now turn to a time of war. The only case, to my know-ledge, which, deals with the criminal responsibility of a soldier obeying orders in time of war is R. v. Smith * and in that case the court refused to countenance the extreme view that a soldier was bound to obey, and was therefore legally protected in obey-ing every order, however unlawful. That case is, however, not one to conjure with and is somewhat irrelevant to the issue, as it dealt with the act of a soldier in shooting, under the orders of his officer, a native in a district in which martial law had been pro-claimed during the South African war and the native was not an enemy he was within the Eing&apos;s peace. The court.was, moreover, a special court sitting under a special Act. The words of the court have, however, value as an obiter dictum; and they made the admission that the imperiousness of the soldier&apos;s duty of obedience was far greater, and consequently his immunity more extended, in time of war than in time of peace. &quot; One must remember,&quot; the court urged, &quot;that especially in time of war immediate obedience to order is required for a private soldier,&quot; and they clearly held that in time of war a soldier is entitled to a stronger presumption of the lawfulness of the order under which he acts. There is another consideration upon which the court was silent, and that is the degree of duress under which a soldier acts in time of war. It must not be for-gotten that in the field an officer can shoot a soldier on the spot if the latter disobeys an order to advance, and no law has ever set limits to what he may do during hostilities if his orders are dis-obeyed. Hale (I., &quot;Pleas of the Crown,&quot; VIII., p. 49) recog-nised the difference when he wrote: &quot;In time of peace the threat of death will not excuse a man (i.e., a man who commits a felony under compulsion) because the law is there to protect him,&quot; whereas &quot;there is to be observed a difference between the times of war or public insurrection and rebellion and times of peace, because in the former a person is under so great a power that he cannot resist or avoid.&quot; Foster (&quot; Crown Cases,&quot; p. 13) makes the same distinction in the case of treason; if there is a continu-ing force and fear, amounting to actual and instant apprehen-sion of death, a man who joins rebels or enemies is excused. If this be true of acts done against the King&apos;s peace and against ,persons within the King&apos;s peace, which is what Hale and Foster have in mind, it is still more true of acts done against &quot; enemies &quot; who are not within the King&apos;s peace. As I have attempted to show in dealing with the question of jurisdiction, it is extremely doubtful if the latter class of acts, whether done in the execution of orders or not, are justiciable at common law at all. It is one thing for a court to sit and determine whether the country is so disturbed as to be domestically in &quot;a state of war,&quot; which is always a question of fact of which it may require proof; it is quite another for a court to enter on a discussion whether the* 17 Cape Eeports (1900) 561. South African cases must be handled with very great caution for it was often difficult to distinguish between rebels and belligerents and different considerations arose according as the military were dealing with disturbed districts within British territory which had Veil proclaimed and enemy territory which was quite outside the King&apos;s peace.  &quot; Cf. War and its Legal Results,&quot; p. 7.
country is at war with some other country, which is not a ques-fcion of fact at all, but one upon which the declaration of the Sovereign is final and entitled to &quot;judicial notice.&quot; In the former case the court can determine both the fact of war and the necessity, and therefore the degree of justification, of the measures taken to meet it; in the second case it can do neither. Stephen, with very good reason, doubts whether a British officer who, in time of war and on an invasion of England by the enemy, put enemy prisoners to death in cold blood could be tried at common law at all; is it any more probable that a British soldier who executed the order would be liable ? And it is quite certain that neither the one nor the other would be liable if the acts were committed outside British territory. American law, the standpoint of which is the same as our law, is clearly con-consious of the distinction.*The English courts have indeed in one case laid down in unequi-vocal language that it is the duty of soldiers and officers to render unquestioning obedience in time of war. They did so in the case of Sutton v. Johnstone (1 East 548).t The court laid down that &quot; A subordinate must not, even to save the lives of others or his own life, judge of the danger, propriety, expediency, or consequence of the order he receives; he must obey. Nothing but a physical impossibility can excuse him.   The first, second, and third part of a soldier is obedience.&quot; But this case was a case of an order to engage the enemy, which I is always a &quot;lawful command,&quot; however unreasonable it may happen under the circumstances to be, and not of an order to do [something unlawful.   Obedience in such a case would not have involved the commission of an offence at common law or under International law.   But even so, Lord Mansfield&apos;s dictum goes far beyond the military view itself.   It is not true that it is a soldier&apos;s duty even supposing, as Lord Mansfield does, that a soldier&apos;s duty and an officer&apos;s military duty are the same never to question the danger, propriety, expediency, or consequence of the order he receives. I know of a case during the present war in which a British subaltern ordered his men to cease firing, and put up the white flag, whereupon his platoon sergeant tore it down and disregarded the order; it was the officer who was subsequently court-martialled and not the man.   Indeed, the Field Service* For example, while laying down that &quot; military officers can no more protect themselves than civilians for actual wrongs committed in time of peace under orders &quot; it qualifies this with the preamble &quot;whatever may be the rule in time of war and in the presence of actual hostilities.&quot; Military Laws of the United States, footnote to Article 21 of the Articles of War, p. 973. Whatever may be the case as to criminal proceedings, it seems clear that no civil action would lie in case of war. Cf. Winthrop 11.1388, &quot; For an act done jure belli, or for the exercise of a belligerent right, an officer or soldier cannot be called to account in a civil proceeding.&quot;t This, however, it should be remarked was a case of tort and there are several things to notice about it before we accept it as an authority one way or the other. In the first place, being an action in tort, it is no authority on the subject of criminal responsibility. In the second place, the courts in entertaining jurisdiction were not dealing with an act done in time of war but with the question whether a prosecution subsequently instituted in time of peace before a court-martial by one officer against another for disobedience to ah order given in war was malicious and without reasonable and probable cause ; the case is Ihere-fore no exception to the rule laid down in Barwis v. Keppel that the courts will not interfere in regard to acts done in the conduct of hostilities. In the third place it did not deal with acts done against the enemy.
Regulations* lay down that if in the face of unexpected local circumstances a subordinate neglects to depart from the letter of his orders, when such departure is clearly demanded by circum-stances, and failure ensues, he will be held responsible for such failure. In such cases he is required to disobey the lawful order because obedience to it turns out to be unreasonable.II.Military Law.What then is the meaning of the words &quot; lawful command &quot; in the Army Act when the order is given on active service. I doubt if the word can be interpreted to mean lawful at Common Law. Primarily it means, as the official comment interprets it to mean, a command which an officer is competent, from a military point of view, to give, according to the usages of the service Or other-wise. If a body of British soldiers shot down German civilians in cold blood under the orders of an officer, the officer would be put on his trial before a court-martial, but it does not follow that the men would be. The fact is the Army Act is silent on the question as to the liability of soldiers to be punished for obeying unlawful commands, and it is almost equally silent on the penalty attaching to soldiers or officers who commit breaches of the laws of war, with the exception of &quot; offences against the property or person of an inhabitant in the country in which they are serv ing &quot;, an expression which is not usually interpreted to include an enemy combatant. Such offences would either be punished under Section 6 (/) just quoted, or under Section 40 dealing with acts to the prejudice of good order and military discipline. They might also be punished under Martial Law. But all this throws but little light on the extent to which a soldier is justified in disobeying such commands. The only case within my knowledge in which the issue was raised in the British Army during the present war concerned a &quot; war crime,&quot; i.e., a crime by the enemy against British troops, a case where a German soldier was charged before a British military court (not a &quot; court-martial &quot;) with treacherously opening fire after surrender. He pleaded that he was acting under the orders of a German officer, and the Com-mander-in-Chief, Lord French, refused to confirm the conviction and sentence, on the ground that there was evidence to support his plea.The whole question must, I think, be considered under two tests: (1) the consequences of disobedience; (2) the scope of military duty. As regards the first, our own military law in practice, the French and German military law in both theory and practice, punish with greater or less severity acts of dis-obedience according as they were or were not committed &quot; in face of thie enemy, &quot;t and this is an argument for allowing a greater* Field Service Regulations Part I., Sec. 13, p. 31.f The Army Act does not make the distinction theoretically-it merely distinguishes &quot;active service,&quot; i.e., between war and peace, but the German Military Code (Sec. 95) further distinguishes disobedience in the field &quot; im Felde,&quot; i.e., in time of war, according as it does or does not take place &quot;before the enemy&quot; (vor dem Feinde). In the French Military Code (Sec. 218) there is the same distinction between disobedience &quot; en presence d ; 1&apos;ennemi&quot; and disobedience &quot; sur un territoire en e&apos;tat de guerre.&quot;
Ill; .bt&apos; w,11; lit3r-,11Sbe tatis . I * This point of view may be illustrated by Sec. 250 of the French Military Code which P Q&quot;?I ^own tna* where a number of soldiers (des militaires en bande) commit pillage, the Id&quot; asp ea*k Pena^.y s^a^ on&apos;y &apos;3e mnictec^on tne ringleaders (instigateurs) and those whose rank :ench Deuces superior to that of the others (les plus e^ev^s en grade).  Compare also Winthrop&apos;s Military Law and Precedents ii., p. 883 &quot; a certain discretion in the execution of an order &apos;lmay sometimes be permitted to officers high in rank or command,&quot;egree of immunity to the soldier who obeys commands contrary the laws of war in the field, e.g., refuses quarter, than to the oldier who obeys similar commands in occupied territory or chlben in charge of a prison camp.   Also one must, I think, dis-:&apos;er inguish between the case of a soldier who obeys the command of n officer and an officer who obeys the command of a superior fficer.   The latter has more discretion, he is usually given more pportunities of deliberation, and he has more knowledge.*    A oldier is not supposed to familiarise himself with the contents f the Field Service Regulations, nor does he receive any educa-ion in military law; the contrary is the case with an officer; the Hague Regulations have been incorporated in the British Manual if Military Law and to some extent in our Field Service Regula-ions and they have been incorporated in the Feld-dienstordnung )j way of Appendix in 1908.    One may therefore impute a knowledge of the Laws of War to an officer which one cannot impute to a soldier.   A soldier, in such cases, is very often in the position imagined by old writers like Coke, Hale and Hawkins, Ihe position of a hangman carrying out an invalid sentence, in ijjg which case they held that, if the sentence had all reasonable If   Appearance of validity, the man&apos;s public official subjection - &apos;-[tyj;ifrorded him immunity.   Be that as it may, it cannot be too ws [clearly asserted that English military law gives little coun-. orptenance to the view that a soldier, much less an officer, must, : &apos;rv under all circumstances in time of war. yield an unquestioning Hftjelobedienoe to the commands imposed upon him.   Where such an AH\ me disobeyed an order which admitted of any doubt as to its ith propriety he would be tried either solely, or at least in the l6y  alternative, under the section which deals with conduct to the lWs prejudice of good order and military discipline, rather than .   jn under the section which deals with the far greater offence, ;[ge; attended by far more intimidating penalties, of disobedience.   I know of a case in the present war in which an officer was ordered t,iV to take charge of a firing party for the execution of a deserter, red land, after being duly warned by his CO., refused to carry out i^b lithe order on the ground that for certain personal peculiar reasons 3at it was repugnant to his feelings.   He was not, though he might .&apos;,m. have been, tried for disobeying a lawful command, wilfully or jon: otherwise; he was tried for the lesser offence of conduct to the ort: prejudice, and his only punishment was a reprimand.    There Iwere present, however, circumstances which made the command Itwolan unreasonable one. 0f 1  As to the second test, the scope of military duty, here we are infon sure grounjd, and, as will be seen in a moment, even the oryf formidable immunities which a German soldier could claim jdis. f under German military law are not impenetrable.   As the official iaceicomment on the Army Act points out, the command must relate Itergto a military duty, that is to say, the disobedience of it must tend
to impede, delay or prevent a military proceeding. The German Military Code admits this in express words. The command must be one relating to military &quot; service &quot; &quot; in Dienstsachen.&quot;* Where an order is given to a soldier, as has frequently been the case in the German Army during the present war, to shoot down unoffending inhabitants, there may be an onus on him to prove that this related to his military service or duty. And in this connection it isi, I think, of supreme importance to insist that any order which is pleaded in defence should be a specific order to commit that offence and not merely a general order, the more so as military law makes a marked distinction, both as regards the offence of ^disobedience and the penalties attaching to it, wording as the order disregarded is a general order or a specific command. The distinction is clearly made in English and American military lawt and may, I think, be inferred from certain words in the German co,d&apos;e.t A general order not to spare the inhabitants, for example, is entitled to less considera-tion, if any, as a defence than a specific command to shoot a particular person or persons.It must always, however, be borne in mind that a soldier&apos;s first duty is to obey. In military law the onus is on the soldier to prove the clear illegality of an order which he has disobeyed; it would therefore be inequitable in criminal proceedings to put upon him the onus of proving the legality of a command which he has obeyed. It must also be remembered that things which are primd facie unlawful in peace immediately, by the mere fact of hostilities, become presumptively lawful in warj And even in peace-time a soldier would seem to be entitled to a presumption that orders apparently regular and valid are lawful. IIIII. German Law.If, therefore, we are to follow any rule at all, it must be euch a rule as we can extract from the laws of war said the military usages of the respective belligerents. We must avoid altogether the decisions of English courts, which have little to do with war and nothing at all to do with acts done against enemies. I would like to enter a word of caution against all attempts to extract a rule of jurisprudence from the decisions of English courts in such a matter as this and to apply it to the conduct of German soldiers.* Militar-strafgesetzbuch, sees. 92, 94 and 95 (which is to be read with sec. 94) on &quot;Disobedience&quot; (Ungehorsam). The French code, which it almost as absolute on the subject of obedience, is to be read subject to the same qualifications. Cf. Augier and Poittevin, Droit Penal Militaire, I., p. 71, note 1.f For example. Army Annual Act, sec. 9, note 9, disregard of a &quot; general order &quot; is not treated as &quot;disobedience&quot; but as &quot;neglect&quot; under sec. 11, and the punishment in the latter case is far less severe. Cf. also Article 21 of the TJ.S. Articles of War on dis-obedience, of which Winthrop says: &quot; It is also agreed by military writers that the &quot; command &quot; contemplated by the Article is an express and personal one, that is to say, an order of a specific character addressed or given to the accused in person, in contradistinction to one of a general scope, as one issued to the command of which the accused is a member and applying to him no more than the rest.- Winthrop, II., 885.X Cf. section 94, which speaks of &quot; express refusal&quot; of an order &quot; received &quot; from a superior.6 Cf. Winthrop, II., p. 889.11 This at least in any subsequent civil action. Cf. Willes J., in Keighley v. Bell, 4 V, &amp; F., p. 400, and to the same effect, Winthrop, II., 1385,
naiand .&apos;orxiI ,$ To ido so is to confuse municipal law with. International law. If I tF W? a^mPJ; ^ ^0 &amp;i a German officer or soldier on trial for these I  I offences will be entitled to say: &quot; You are applying municipallotf laW&apos;- ^ery we^* ^m as you iucl e ^e con(luct 0* British Ithl&apos; so^rs ^ English law, my conduct must be judged by German ElJ law.&quot; He might plead this in mitigation; he might plead it in lb J bar. His plea would be formidable. And what is more, German I i law would go far to justify him. The German Military Code, trdj U1^k6 our Army Act, never contemplates, in the sections dealing J. with Disobedience (&quot; Ungehorsam &quot;),* the possibility of a com-IJ mand being not &quot;lawful&quot; even in time of peace. The words used are as a rule &quot; Disobedience of a command in a matter of service &quot; (&quot; Ungehorsam. gegen einen Befehl in Dienstsachen &quot;). The principal section (Section 95) is as follows:   3 I If one of the acts indicated in Section 94t is committed before i an assembled body of men, or against an order to take up arms, X or when under arms, the offender incurs confinement or detention in a fortress up to five years; if in the field the same for not less than one year. In less grave cases, if the deed is not committed in the field, not against an order to take up arms, and not under arms, the penalties are modified to 14 days of close arrest.If such an act is committed in the face of the enemy, imprisonment for not less than 10 years is incurred.   If the act amounts to obedience being ex-pressly by word or deed refused to an order given in the face of the enemy, the death penalty.is incurred; in less grave cases imprisonment for not less than 10 years or imprisonment for life. Supposing the orders thus given involve a breach of the civil law, i.e., the ordinary criminal law?   The contingency is dealt with in another section of the Military Code, which is sufficiently remarkable.   It is as follows:  If through the execution of an order in a matter of serviceg a penal law (i.e., the ordinary criminal law) is violated, the person who gives the order is alone responsible.   The subordinate who obeys it incurs the punishment of an accomplice (Theilnehmer) if  (1) he has exceeded the order given him; (2) it was known to him that the order of the superior related to an act which aimed at (bezweckte) a civil or military offence or mis-demeanour (Section 47).* Militar-strafgesetzbuch, sees. 92-96.f Section 94 states that if anyone expressly refuses obedience or manifests his dis-obedience by words, gestures, or other behaviour, likewise one who questions an order of his superior given him on service or a reproof, or who persists in disobedience after an order has been repeatedly received in a matter of service, then such an one is liable to close arrest for not less than 14 days or confinement up to three years.* &quot; Unter das Gewehr zu treten&apos;&quot;-an expression which it is difficult to translate literally but which is interpreted by the commentators to mean any service involving the use of arms or the display of armed force.  It does not necessarily mean &quot; active service.&quot;8 Much, of course, turns on whai is a &quot; Dif-nstsache.&quot; The editors of the Military Code (r. and E. p. 181) explain it as every relation for the regulation of which some activity is required from the nature of the military power.  This is very vague and they content -iheiMelves with saying that it is impossible to prescribe what exactly it is,
In what is in many ways the best and most authoritative com-mentary on the Military Code, that of Eomen and Rissom,* who support their comments with plentiful citations from the judg-ments of the Imperial Military Court (the Reichsmilitargericht), this section is interpreted as follows:  &quot; The consequence of the principle of military trustt is the immunity of the subordinate in the execution of an order in matters of service.   He is only responsible if it was known to him not only that the act to be done amounted as a matter of fact to culpable (strafbar) conduct, but that the superior had ordered the&apos; act conscious of its unlawfulness and culpability.   Or, as the Imperial Military Court, XIII., 185, and to the like effect XIX., 190, expresses it, it is not sufficient to prove knowledge of the existence of the general culpable intention (Vorsatz) of the superior, but the subordinate must know (i.e., must have known) that the superior is acting with the view (in der Absicht) of attaining an unlawful object by means of the corn-mission of an offence or misdemeanour4 &quot; In other words, the soldier, before he dares to disobey an order, must be convinced not only that the order is wrong, but that the officer who gives it knows it to be wrong, and that his officers knowledge is guilty knowledge.   Only when he is convinced of this is the soldier liable to punishment in a civil court for the execution of an unlawful order.   It is clear that the German rule is the reverse of the English one.   In English law, in the case of the soldier who, in obedience to orders, commits a breach of the law, his guilt is imputed; in German law the imputation is his innocence.   And this, be it remembered, is in time of peace. It must not be forgotten that the standpoint of German law is the exact opposite of our own, where the acts of public officials, whether civil or military, are concerned.    In English law a public official is never protected, except by statute (as in the case of constables executing a warrant), against the consequences, civil or criminal, of acting under orders.   This is the general principle, subject to some slight qualifications, in the case of civil liability, such as Sir Frederick Pollock had indicated in his book on Torts.   But in German law, where we have to en-counter droit administratif, the subordinate is, according to Laband, who is supported by the judgment of the Reichsgericht and&apos; the Prussian Obertribunal, bound to obey an order, however unlawful, unless it is irregular in form or on the face of it; he can only question, says Laband, the form, never the substance: otherwise, he adds, the subordinate, not the superior, would be supreme, g      _.* I have used the edition published at Berlin in 1916. The two editors are both lawyers and one of them is described as &quot; Kriegsgertehtsrat&quot; with the 18th Division.f &quot; Militarische Vertrauensgrundsatz &quot; which is elsewhere explained to mean (p. 184), the principle in virtue of which the subordinate is in duty (or rather &quot; in service&quot;  &quot; dienstlich &quot;) bound to assume the lawfulness of an order.% P. 185. The editors add, that the fact that a soldier has doubts about the lawfulness of the order or is careless in the assumption that it is lawful will not involve him in any penal consequences.ij See Heilborn &quot;Die Pflicht des preussischen und des Reichsbeamten ziir Befolgung rechtswidriger Dienstbef ehle.&apos;&quot; (&quot; The duty of Prussian and Imperial Officials in the obser-vance of ministerial orders which are contrary to law &quot;) in Gierke&apos;s Festschrift (1911) p. 125, 4c. Droit administratif, however, is conoerned with civil, and not with criminal liability.
IV.Feench Law.French Law is somewhat less absolute than the German. The Military Code admits no qualification as to the nature of the command.   The section* says quite unequivocally:  Est puni de mort, avec degradation militaire, tout militaira qui refuse d&apos;obeir lorsqu&apos;il est commando pour marcher contre 1&apos;ennemi, ou pour tout autre service ordonne par son chef en presence de 1&apos;ennemi ou de rebelles armes. Si hors le case prevu par le para-graphe precedent, la desobeissance a eu lieu sur un territoire en etat de guerre ou de siege,t la peine est de cinq ans a dix ans de travaux publics ou, si le coupable est bfncier, de la destitution, avec empri-sonnement de deux ans a cinq ans 4The Cour de Cassation has interpreted! this to mean that the soldier is bound to obey &quot;all orders relative to the accomplish-ment of any military duty whatsoever.&quot; What then happens if the order in question is one which involves a breach of the ordinary law? The Penal Code, i.e., the ordinary criminal law, provides that &quot;no criminal offence is committed when homicide, wound-ing, or battery are ordered by the law and commanded by the legitimate authority. II Thus two elements are essential to the immunity of a person acting under orders (1) the order must be given by a person having legal authority; and (2) it must be an order lawful in itself. But in the case of a soldier, unlike a civilian, it is held that one of these elements alone is sufficient  in other words, that if the order is given him by his lawful mili-tary superior it matters not whether the order itself is lawful or not. In a case which raised this very point before the Cour de Cassation it was urged and approved that the duty which the French soldier owes in such a case is that of passive obedience; he must obey on the instant and without question; if he is in any doubt, he must obey first and make his representations after-wards.t There is no difference according to French Law between peace and war in this respect, except that in the former &quot; extenuating circumstances &quot; may be admitted in the case of dis-obedience, while in the latter they may not.** There is, however, nothing in the French Code resembling the peculiar* Code de Justice Militaire, Sec. 218.t Etat de siege is a term for which thereis no equivalent in English Law, but it means such a state of affairs as in England would justify the proclamation of Martial Law, with this notable difference that in France the Government has not to justify.% It will be noted also that there are here none of the mitigating distinctions between disobedience and wilful disobedience which are to be found in our own Act. 5 Augier et Poittevin II. 659.I Article 327.   Article 64 applies the principle generally to all acts done under a con-straint which is too great to be resisted, f Cited in Augier and Poittevin, I. 70 and II. 658.** It is worthy of note that whereas French and German Law presoribe the death sen-tence as the only sentence which a military court can pass in certain cases, the Army Act leaves the court free in every case, even in the c,?se of cowardice or wilful disobedience before the enemy, to pass such less sentence as it thinks fit. The words used in the Army Act wherever the death penalty is authorised are &quot; Death or such less punishment aa is in this Act mentioned.&quot; Ours is the most lenient military code in existence.
doctrine of the German Military Code that, in any subsequent criminal proceedings, the presumption shall be all in favour of the soldier&apos;s having acted lawfully in carrying out an order which involved a breach of the law. Presumably he would have to prove constraint and the degree of constraint.&apos;    &apos; V. &apos;International Law.The question has received very little attention in International Law. Writers, in dealing with the subject of offences against the laws of war, have either assumed that the offences were unauthorised or have fallen back upon reprisals. They are there-fore almost uniformly silent on the point. In the latest edition of Wheaton it is stated (p. 478) that, if prisoners of war have committed an offence before capture, &quot; the fact that they acted under Orders cannot furnish a valid excuse.&quot; The fact that the writers who state expressly that offences against the laws of war may be punished, say it without qualification/ would seem to suggest that either they never contemplated that such acts could be authorised by a superior officer or, if they did, that no such orders could be excused. Holland&apos;s statement that if a whole corps disregards the laws of war, e.g., by the refusal of quarter, any individuals belonging to it who are taken prisoners may be treated as implicated in the offence clearly implies that superior Orders are no excuse; Article 66 of the original American Instructions is to the same effect. The only statement to the contrary is that of Professor Oppenheim, who states in his book on International Lawf and in the chapter on Land Warfare which he contributed to the British Manual of Military Law that&quot; Members of the armed forces who commit such viola-tions of the recognised rules of warfare as are ordered by their Government or by their commanders are not war criminals and therefore cannot be punished by the enemy.He may punish the officials or commanders responsible for such order, but otherwise lie may only resort to the other means of redress (i.e., reprisals).&quot;I can find no authority for the proposition contained in the first sentence and Professor Oppenheim gives none. In accord-ance with his usual custom he quotes no authorities in footnotes but refers the reader to a number of authorities at the head of his chapter. I have examined all the authorities he thus refers to and can find nothing in them which would give the slightest* Holland, The Laws of War on Land, sees., 117, 118; Hall (7th edition), p. 437; the editor of the seventh edition refers, without expressing an opinion, to Professor Oppenheim&apos;s view (p. 489); Westlake, pp. 488-9; Bluntschli, sees. 548, 640. For French authorities, see below. As for German writers, in addition to Bluntschli, Lueder, Ullmiinn and Zorn, to the best of my recollection, never deal with the point of justification by superior orders. Halleck (1878 edition) i., 473, says definitely, when speaking of the immunity extended to individuals whose hostile acts are ratified by their governments, &quot; such acts, however, must not exceed what the laws of war have established as belligerent rights of. subjects of hostile states, for anything done in violation of the laWs of war the individual is liable to punishment. . -f ii., p. 309.
support to his contention^   Some authority for his statement might be found in much older writers who wrote in the infancy of International Law when almost anything done by a belligerent was considered legitimate; for example Vattel (Droit des Gens, liv. III. ch. II, par. 187) says &quot;on all occasions susceptible of doubt, the whole nation, the individuals, and especially the military, are to submit their judgment to those who hold the reins of government.   .   .   .   The subjects, and in particular the military, are innocent, they have acted only from a necessary obedience.&quot;   But there are very few, if any, modern writers who have expressed themselves in this sense and it is difficult to understand how so positive a statement has found its way into the Manual of Military Law although it seems by no means certain that it will be allowed to remain there.   Unfortunately it has, on the strength of Professor Oppenheim&apos;s authority,t found its way into the revised Instructions issued to the American Army and published in. the year 1914 under the title of &quot; Rules of Land Warfare.&quot;   In section 366 dealing with &quot;offences com-mitted by armed forces&quot; and their punishment it is stated that &quot; Individuals of the armed forces will not be punished for these offences in case they are committed under the orders or sanction of their government or commanders.&quot; The American Rule says &quot;will not be punished&quot;; Professor Oppenheim says they &quot; cannot&quot; be punished.   So dogmatic a statementt must be received with extreme caution, if not repudiated altogether.   The subject has lately received some incidental attention from M. Louis Renault, $ in an article on the subject.   &quot; De 1&apos;application du droit penal aux faits de la guerre.&quot;   His opinion is entitled to the utmost respect but it is somewhat difficult to discover it.   At the conclusion of his article he inclines to the view (pp. 339, 341-2) that the exercise of a post-bellum jurisdiction over members of the German armed forces is to be deprecated because &quot; presque toujours, c&apos;est par ordre superieur que les infractions au droit des gens ont ete commises &quot; and also because they were probably done under constraint. But as we have seen, the degree of constraint (which need not always have existed) is a varying one and the Article of the Code penal II which he cites assumes it must be overwhelm-ing.   It is also difficult to reconcile his conclusion with his earlier statement (p. 315) that the commanders of German sub-marines who sank the Lusiltania and other such vessels could be* The authorities cited are Holland, Bluntschli, Takabashi, Ariga, Spaight, and (in the Revue du Droit International, 1878, Vol. X., p. 282) Landa. I have been unable to trace the slightest reference to the subject of justification by superior orders in any of these authorities.t American &quot; Rules of Land-Warfare &quot; Sec. 366 which cites Professor Oppenheim as its sole authority.  The preface (p. 7) states that &quot; especial use&quot; has been made of his -chapter on &quot;Land Warfare &quot;in the British Manual. I understand, however, that the U. S. Government have now withdrawn their own Manual, owing to doubts on this and other points.J 1 have also examined the leading French authorities, Bonfils (see 4th edition, p. 626), Despagnet (4th edition, p. 858) and Pillet, but have failed to find in them any support far Professor Oppenheim&apos;s statement.g Clunefs Journal du Droit International, Vol. 42 (1915) pp. 313-344. See also the article by Professor Merignhac in the Revue generale du, droit international public January, 1917, pp. 1-56; on page 50 of which Merignhac discusses the question somewhat incon-clusively. He states (on p. 53) that the French military courts, in trying German prisoners of war for breaches of the laws of war where the &quot;constraint&quot; of superior orders wa pleaded, have refused to admit the plea,II. Article 64,
charged with murder and that the charge would be well founded (absolument fondee), for there can be no doubt that these com-manders acted under superior orders,VI.THE SCALE OF RESPONSIBILITY THE POSITION OFTHE EX-KAISER.At what point, if any, is the application of punishment to stop?  Is any distinction to be made between the ex-Kaiser, who issues an order, the Chief of Staff who countersigns it, the Army Commander who bases a General Order upon it, the Corps Commander and his subordinates who transmit it, and the officer who superintends its actual execution?   If we were discussing the matter in the termsvof the ordinary criminal law, there would be no great difficulty.    The last of these authorities is the principal, the others are accessories before the fact and German law,* like English law, holds that he who procures the commis-sion of a felony is himself a felon and equally punishable with the doer thereof, nor does the punishment of the one exclude the punishment of the other.   But we are dealing with International Law and with Military Law.   We have to distinguish between peace and war.   In time of peace the sovereign of one State enjoys immunity from criminal proceedings in the court of another and from arrest in virtue of a rule of comity based on International Law and so do the sovereign^ diplomatic and other agents the distinction lies at the root of the definition of piracy.   Persons who are not his agents and who act without his authorization can claim no immunity.   In time of war the position is not so simple.   The sovereign and his ministers at once lose their right to personal immunity and are liable to capture as prisoners of war; there is no ground, remarks Bluntschli for their exemption, but quite the contrary, as they have usually brought the war upon themselves, or have decided upon it, and should bear the primary responsibility for it.t   If their sovereign immunity is gone and they are to be treated as prisoners of war it would seem a fortiori that, like other and lesser prisoners of war, they should be liable to punishment for any breaches of the laws of war.   Renault, however, argues that no State has the right to &quot;punish&quot; another State and no belligerent has the right to punish another belligerent, using that term in its collective sense; you cannot punish a nation, he argues, but only individual members of it as individuals.   On the same principle you cannot, he adds, &quot; punish,&quot; juridically speaking, the officers who violated the neutrality of Belgium, for that act was done in their official capacity as agents of the Government, and as for the Government it was a &quot; political,&quot; not* See See. 48 of the German Penal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) dealing with an &quot;Anstifter,&quot; i.e., any person who has intentionally determined another, whether by persuasion, force or otherwise, to do a criminal act. The instigation may be merely a general order, t.e., it need not be addressed to a particular person.f Pas modern? yplkerrecht par. 696.
a criminal, offence. Only if the officers had invaded Belgium without authority could they be punished punished by their own Government as French officers can be punished in such a case under a section (226) of the Code de Justice Militaire which is founded on the same principles as our Foreign Enlistment Act. There is some foundation for this contention that authorized acts done by officers acting as agents of their governments cannot be punished; it lies at the root* of the rule that &quot; francs-francs-tireurs,&quot; i.e., enemy subjects who take up arms without the authority of their governments, are not entitled to the privileges of prisoners of war. But the privilege of authorized combatants, when taken prisoner, is itself qualified by the conditions that they shall have observed the rules of war.t And the breach of Belgian neutrality, though a breach of International Law, was not, strictly speaking, an offence against the laws and customs of war; a wrong done to a neutral is not a wrong done to a belligerent. The only form of &quot;punishment&quot; of a belligerent State known to International Law, is reprisals, and reprisals are based on the principle that you &quot;punish&quot; the State or the armies because it and they are responsible for the acts of the individual delinquents whom you have been unable to reach and over whom they possess authority. The assumption is that they ought to punish them in the real sense of the word punish-ment. All International agreements have proceeded on this principle.t But reprisals themselves are not punishment, their object is not to punish an offence but to prevent its repetition. One writer of authority! urges that when it is impossible for a belligerent to get hold of enemy offenders reprisals should be practised primarily upon the commanders and officers of the units to which these offenders belong, but he is proceeding on the assumption that those officers failed to prevent the acts com-plained of, not that they ordered them. The truth is that inter-national lawyers have never, except by a bashful reference to reprisals, contemplated a case where, like the present, the whole government from top to bottom had authorized and perpetrated wholesale breaches of the laws of war. The case was unthink-able. When Article 3 of The Hague Convention laid down that a belligerent shall be pecuniarily responsible for violation of the provisions of the annexed Regulations it proceeded on the prin-ciple of liability in tort and not in crime; the belligerent was liable for the acts of his servants, because he was their superior and they were acting in the scope of their employment and not because he was, or could conceivably be, an accomplice. There would be no point in saying that a Government was responsible* Cf. Bluntschli, par. 571.f This qualification must surely apply generally to any plea of &quot; act of state.&quot; The immunity of &quot; public acts &quot; of individuals, whose acts nave been ratified by their govern-ments, when admitted by the ILS. Secretary of State in 1841, in the case of the Caroline (McLeod&apos;s case), was based by the latter on &quot;the principles of public law &quot; and &quot; by virtue of the law of nations.&quot; It was not an act, as is the case with the offences charged against German armed forces, done against the Law of Nations itself. See Halleck I., 430, Hall (7th edition), p. 324.J Cf. Geneva Convention of 1906, Art. 28; Hague Regulations, Art. 41. The French law of 24th July, 1913, has given effect to Art. 28 of the Geneva Convention by empower-ing military courts to try &quot; any individual&quot; who ill-treats the wounded.^ Martens La Paix et la Guerre, p. 428.
for acts it had ordered; there is much point in saying that it shall be responsible for acts it has failed to prevent.*All this, I think, supports the view that superior orders are no excuse. International Law seems to have proceeded on the assumption that no such orders infringing the laws and customs of war will be given by a belligerent sovereign, whatever may be the case with Army commanders. In practice it is not because delinquents are State agents but in spite of it that they are punished. The belligerent offended assumes that there are cer-tain orders which, the other belligerent would not give; if it does give them the first belligerent ignores the fact of the order as being one which the other had no right to give and as therefore one which the subordinate was under no duty to obey. This, at any rate, was the point of vieAv of the German Government in the case of Captain Fryatt. They knew, and admitted that they knew,t that the act for which he was tried was authorized and indeed ordered by the British Government but as a defence they ignored it. Nor did they pretend that his conviction and execution was an act of reprisal; they contended that it was a punishment for an offence against the laws of war. They took the same ground in the case of two British officers who were tried and sentenced to ten years&apos; penal servitude for dropping propa-gandist leaflets from the air over the German lines. In this case the German Government were fully aware, as appears from the official correspondence, that the acts with which these officers were charged were done under orders and, indeed, under the instruc-tions of the British Government; none the less, in their Note Verbale of 28th April, 1918, they contended that the conviction was &quot; not an act of reprisal but on legal principles.&quot;! The German Government is therefore estopped from pleading the principle of superior orders.There remains the question whether the higher authorities who gave the orders as well as the officers who executed them can be punished : It is usual to say in such cases that &quot; reprisals &quot; are the proper course. It seems to be assumed that a &quot; Govern-ment &quot; or a &quot; State &quot; cannot be punished. No doubt the basis of this assumption is that the one government is not the superior, of the other, and there is the underlying assumption that it is a legal government and that to punish it is to proscribe it and make the resumption of relations and the negotiation of a treaty of peace impossible. This is normally true but the present situa-tion is abnormal $ and it must be remembered that an &quot; asso-ciated &quot; belligerent, the Government of the United States, has* Article 28 of the Geneva Convention of 1906, by which the signatory Governments undertook to adopt legislation for the repression, in time of war, of individual acts of pillage, etc., is, of course, silent on the subject of authorized pillage, but the French legis-lative measures, giving effect to this article, would presumably apply not only to French soldiers but to any member of the enemy forces who committed such acts within the zone of operations. .f German official statement reproduced in the Times 29th July. 1916: &quot;He (Captain Fryatt) confessed that in so doing he had acted in accordance with the instructions of the Admiralty.&quot;X Case of 2nd Lieutenants Scholtz and Woolley (extracted from War Office papers).5 How abnormal may be gathered from the adoption by the ex-Kaiser of full responsi-bility for the atrocities committed. See the letter quoted by Merignhac (op. cit. p. 52), which the ex-Kaiser is alleged to have addressed to the Emperor Francis Joseph &quot;[II faut tout mettre a feu et a sang; dgorger hommes et femmes, enfants et vieillards, ne laisaer debout ni un arbre ni une maison,&quot;
declared that it would not negotiate with the German dynasty. The Hohenzollern Government was virtually declared an outlaw which, until reconstituted, could never be again received into the comity of nations. It would therefore be the height of pedantry to treat the situation in accordance with precedents; the situation itself is unprecedented. I can see no reason, therefore, for according any immunity to the higher authorities in Germany any more than to the lower. When the Turkish Government ordered the exposure of British subjects on the Gallipoli Penin-peninsula they were informed by the British Government that the authorities who gave the order, and not merely those who ex-ecuted it, would be held personally responsible. This is a case . in point.With the lay argument, now advanced in some quarters, that to punish the ex-Kaiser and his agents is to victimize them for acts in which the whole German people were equally involved I \m not concerned. But it may be remarked that as the German )people have repudiated their government it does not lie with them to advance it. The German Government was an autocratic, not a responsible, Government, and although it is no doubt true that the German people approved their acts, that approval was neither a sanction nor a justification. It is not a case of vicarious punish-ment. The German Government were principals and no one has ever held that a principal is to go free because there also exists an accessory before or after the fact. The law punishes the prin-cipal because it must, the accessory if it can. If a number of persons participate in a riot all are equally guilty but this has never been held to be an argument for letting off the few you catch because there are many whom you cannot catch. The same principle holds good in military law of a mutiny. But we have not to consider this.*VII.CONCLUSION.The conclusion at which I have arrived is that all German officers, high or low, who have ordered or executed acts amount-ing to a violation of &quot; the principles of the law of nations, de-rived from the usages established among civilised peoples, from the laws of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience &apos;&apos; should be brought to trial. They should be tried according to that military and martial law or &quot; common law of war &quot; which is recognized in International Law as the jurisdiction of all belligerents, prolonged, if need be, by a stipulation in the Treaty of Peace that the Treaty which is the sole authority for ter-minating the war shall not terminate the jurisdiction which war confers. It may be argued that such a treaty is unusual but so was the &quot; armistice &quot; which d^floo the juristic definition of an armistice as a suspension of arms which shall leave each bel-ligerent at the end of it in the position in which he was at the beginning. .* The conclusion! have arrived at, as regards the prosecution of all offenders, high or low, appears also to be that of Professor M&amp;ignhac in the articles already cited.. , See, for example, p. 64. &quot; II faudra poursuivre tous les coupables sans exception, depuia let 6htft d&apos;etat juaqu&apos;aux simples soldata.&quot;
If a German officer arraigned pleads superior orders, he should be required to prove (1) that the order to commit the offence with which he is charged was a specific command given him by hissuperior officer; (2) that it was an order to do the precise act charged.   Sucha defence would clearly fail if the accused exceeded the order;(3) that the order had reference to a military duty. If the accused succeeds so far, his defence may still fail (1) if the act charged is so flagrantly and obviously contrary to the laws of war that the accused cannot be regarded as having acted without knowledge of its illegality; or(2) if the prosecution can prove circumstances from which knowledge of the illegality can be imputed to the accused.If the plea of superior orders does not succeed as a defence, it may still be relevant in two ways (a) as a circumstance to be considered by the Court in mitigation of punishment;(6) as connoting a constraint which the accused could not resist. The degree of constraint will depend upon the consequences of disobedience according to German law. It may conceivably be so great as to render the act virtually an involuntary one. The onus of prov-ing this will be on the accused.The requirement of the proof that the order had reference to a military duty is important. Many a command would, no doubt, be justified by German officers or their superiors on the ground of &quot; military necessity.&quot; It is a plea which should be subjected to the narrowest scrutiny. The plea that military necessity will cover anything has never in modern times been recognized in International Law; it is peculiar to the recent German school of &quot; barrack-room lawyers&quot; of whom Lueder was the apostle and Professor Zorn is the disciple.* Older German writers like Bluntschli, in common with all authoritative French and English writers, condemn it utterly and declare that &quot; military neces-sity consists in the necessity of those measures which are indis-pensable for securing the ends of the war and which are lawful according to the modem law and usuage of War.&quot;fAccording to the recent school of German writers there is no such thing as law in war; there are no laws, even as to &quot; the pro-tection of defenceless private persons, wounded and disabled soldiers, flags of truce, sacredness of treaties,&quot; which may not be violated in the name of necessity J; the gravest offence is unassail-* Lueders chapters on Krhgsncht in Vol. IV. of Holtzendorffs Haridbuoh des Volker-rechts ; Zorn, in his Das Kriegsrecht zu Lande (1906).f American Instructions, Article 16. To the same effect Bluntschili (sees. 549, 550), who insists that the plea of &quot;necessity&quot; is subject always to the measures taken in its name being in agreement &quot; with the general law &quot; (&quot; mit dem allgemeinen Recht&quot;).X Thus Lueder, IV., 255.
able from the point of view of International Law &quot; if military necessity can be pleaded for it*); military necessity is the sole and ultimate criterion t; &quot;success is its own justification &quot;%) right and force are synonymous, &quot;t No such plea can be allowed to an officer in favour of the presumptive lawfulness of an order he has executed; it will certainly be urged, but to admit it would be to deny that there are laws of war at all. He may also plead, under Sec. 47 of his own Military Code, that he did not know that the superior officer who gave it &quot;intentionally pursued an unlawful object.&quot; The value of the plea will depend on the nature of the object but it will probably be found on examina-tion that many of the offences were committed not merely in pursuance of formal orders but of exhortations to cruelty, malignancy, and terrorism which could leave no doubt in the mind of those who executed them that the superior officer inten-tionally pursued &quot;an unlawful object.&quot; This is certainly true of the exhortations addressed by the notorious Niemeyer to the guards of his prison camp. The language which has accom-panied many of these orders, the form in which they were given, the incitements by which they were attended, could leave no doubt in the mind of any reasonable man that what was contem-plated was not an order in the course of military duty but the gratification of a personal hate and a racial animosity.J..H. MORGAN.23rd December, 1918.A NOTE ON THE DEFENCE OF SUPERIOR ORDERS BEFORE A COURT OF NATIONS.By the Right Hon. Sir Frederick Pollock, Bart.The questions to be dealt with are unique in more than one way.Precedent is wholly lacking for the facts. Before this war no one thought it possible that a Great Power should issue deliberate and systematic orders for the commission of acts hitherto con-demned by the consent and abhorred in the usuage of civilized nations.&apos;The jurisdiction is likewise without precedent. History fur-nishes no example of a tribunal established by several allied States to do justice on offenders against rules and customs equally recognized by all of them.Such a tribunal is not bound by the rules laid down in any one jurisdiction; so far as the several rules of different nations agree, it may adopt their contents as witness of general consent. The same may be said of the opinions given by responsible advisers and learned authors, and of judicial decisions so far as relevant; none of these can have more than persuasive authority, though* Zorn, Das Krie.gsre.schatcht eu Lande, p. 15. t Ibid., p. 270. J; Ibid., p. 210.
their weight cannot be trifling and in some cases may oe veiy great. .The tribunal has to settle for itself (except so far as may be provided by the instrument which creates it) both the grounds of liability that will support an accusation and the admissible grounds of excuse. It may be presumed, however, that, where the authorities or analogies most nearly in point are found to differ in their results, the tribunal will incline to the more merciful view. Otherwise it does not seem to matter whether a defendent is or is not excusable according to the service regula-tions or other positive rules of national law to which he was subject. A claim by every man to be judged, as a matter of right, by his own law cannot be allowed before such a tribunal as is now contemplated.One ground of excuse is necessary obedience to superior orders. I say excuse as implying admission that the act in question was in itself wrong. A defence based on justification, i.e., maintain-ing that in the circumstances no wrong at all was done, is of a wholly different nature.Acts of wanton malice or excessive violence done without orders, even though they may be winked at or irregularly encouraged by superiors such as assaults on prisoners of war  are, of course, inexcusable. Nothing that here follows is appli-cable to offences of that kind.In principle there is nothing new in the problem of conflict between a particular obedience such as is due to a military or other superior in office, or to the temporal sovereign-and a more general and higher obedience. Cicero defended Cassius in the Senate for having exceeded his authority for the purpose of rescuing oppressed people in a case of urgency. The medieval doctors laid it down that commands even of one&apos;s lawful prince contrary to the law of nature (identical for this purpose with universally recognised rules of morality) ought not to be obeyed; but they added the caution that there is a strong presumption in favour of the prince&apos;s command being justifiable; in other words, the wrongfulness of the command will justify disobedience when, but only when, it is manifest. One can hardly imagine, to take a strong example, that any medieval Catholic soldier would have obeyed his sovereign&apos;s command to kill a man acknow-leged to be the duly elected Pope. .It is well to remember that laws of war and customs of the sea were known, like the law merchant, long before the system of modern international law was framed. All these were conceived as deriving their authority from natural reason evidenced by the common consent of mankind or the classes of men specially concerned. . , .Excuses for breaking a rule assumed to be binding on at least all members of civilized commonwealths must rest on some reasonable ground. Ignorance of the rule is not such a ground; it rather stands itself in need of excuse. But ignorance of the circumstances that make the act in question a breach of the rule may &quot;be excusable or unavoidable in all but the most flagrant cases. In particular a subordinate is bound throughout the ordinary course of service (more especially but not exclusively
in warlike service) to presume that the orders of a superior whom he is regularly bound to obey are lawful and proper.In order, therefore, to hold the inferior liable for the execution of superior orders, it must be shown that the order was manifestly wrongful, i.e., such that he actually knew or with the means of knowledge then and there at his command ought to have known it to be wrongful. The degree of knowledge and intelligence to be expected of the inferior will evidently vary with his rank and education, and no fixed rule can be laid down to measure it. But it may be said, at the lowest point of the scale, that it seems extremely difficult in any case to hold a man guilty who, not him-self being in any position of responsible authority, acts as a mere instrument in executing an order of a kind recognized as usual in the course of service. (Elementary examples: the men of a firing party told off to shoot a deserter have not to satisfy themselves of the facts, or that the process of the court-martial was correct. But if the same men are ordered to shoot unarmed priests, women and children, they must know that this is not a usual act of war, and further questions then arise.)A man under authority and having others under him, whose duty is to receive and transmit orders and see that they are performed, but not to execute them in person, will, as a rule, have some discretion as to the manner of execution, and must be answerable for exercising that discretion justly and reasonably. The degree of intelligence to be required of him must depend on his rank and education and the nature of the case.If a superior gives an order which does not on the face of it reasonably appear to be in the ordinary course of service (that is, such an order as is in common practice given and obeyed without question) the inferior must judge of its propriety for himself, and acts upon it at his own risk.   This is not a frequent case.A distinct ground of excuse is compulsion. The order was wrongful; the inferior knew or ought to have known it; but he was under constraint and had no choice but to obey. Here it seems that, in order to amount to a good excuse, the constraint must be overpowering. There must be fear of death or of some evil comparable to it in gravity, such fear as a man of ordinary courage cannot resist: &quot; qui cadit in constantem virum &quot; as the Roman lawyers said.It remains to add that, as we learn from the common experi-ence of justice in criminal matters, facts alleged in defence but not sufficient for justification or excuse are not to be wholly dis-regarded. They may still have their effect in mitigating the sentence. The propriety and the measure of such mitigation  extending, it may be, to the imposition of a merely nominal penalty are in the judicial discretion of the Court and not definable by rule.One practical result of the foregoing considerations is that it can hardly be useful to take proceedings against merely minis-terial agents unless in gross and extreme cases where the act committed is such as to shock any plain man&apos;s conscience.December 30, 1918.P. POLLOCK.
FIRST INTERIM REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE FOR OFFENCES ON LAND.Your Sub-Committee was appointed on November 6th, 1918, and consists of the following members:  Mr. Justice Peterson (Chairman). Sir R. B. D. Acland, K.C. Sir John G. Butcher, K.C., M.P. General G. K. Cocjkerill (War Office). Mr. C. F. Gill, K.C. Mr. J. F. More, O.B.E. (War Office). Major V. R. M. Gattie, O.B.E. (War Office). Mr. W. A. Stewart (Foreign Office-resigned November 12th 1918).Sir Ellis Hume Williams, K.C., M.P. (Added November 20th, 1918).Mr. J. E. G. de Montmorency, M.A., LL.B. (Secretary).The Sub-Committee has held seven meetings and has reviewed a considerable amount of printed and unprinted evidence sup-plied by the Government Committee on the treatment of British Prisoners of War by the German Authorities.The following Memoranda have been considered and are appended to this Interim Report:  1. The history of the transfer of British Prisoners of War to Russia.2. The conditions in German working camps on the Russian Front.3. The conditions obtaining in certain German mines and quarries, used for the detention and employment of British Prisoners of War.4. German working camps on the Western Front and the responsibility of the German Higher Command.5. Organisation of the German military system.Working Camps on the Eastern Front.   (Memoranda 1 and 2.)In April and May, 1916, German Prisoners of War were sent from England to work at Rouen and Havre unloading cargoes other than munitions of war. On May 15th, 1916, the British Government were informed through the American Embassy that the German Military Authorities had in consequence decided to send 2,000 British Prisoners of W^ar to work in occupied Russian territory, under conditions similar to those existing at Rouen and Havre. On the same date the American Ambassador was informed by the British Government that the representatives of the American Embassy at Paris could visit the depots at Rouen and Havre. Similar facilities for British Prisoners of War in Russia were demanded by the British Government on May 29th, 1916. This was not granted until June, 1917, except in the case of a visit by Mr. Jackson, the American representative, to Libau on October 16th, 1916.
The 2,000 prisoners, divided into four parties of 500 each known as E.K.1, E.K.2, E.K.3 and E.K.4, were collected from different camps in Germany and sent to Angersee, Mitau, Wainoden and Libau, respectively, the whole being under the command of Landwehr Captain Forster. From these central camps the men were sent to a number of working camps, where, generally speak-ing, the accommodation was of the roughest description, the water supply bad or non-existent, the sanitary arrangements very in-ferior, and various forms of cruel and brutal punishment were inflicted. Complaints by the British Government led to a visit in June or July, 1916, to the main Courland camps by Captain Draudt of the Department of Prisoners of War at the German War Office. His Eeport mentioned by name many British N.C.Os. as being reliable men. The statements of some of these have been obtained and steps are being taken to secure the evidence of the rest. By a Note Verbale, of January 24th, 1917, the German Government alleged that German Prisoners of War &quot; suffered from inadequate food, defective accommodation (only tents being-provided in many cases), as well as being subjected to hard work and irregularity in the matter of mails.&quot; They asked that the prisoners should -be moved thirty kilometres behind the firing line and provided with suitable accommodation. The complaint con-tained in this Note was answered by the British Government on February 8th, 1917, with the assurance that the prisoners re-ceived the same food as the British troops; 75 per cent, were in huts, the remainder being, like many British troops, in specially warmed tents provided with floor-boards; that strict orders had been given against their being employed within the range of German gun-fire, but that one man had been wounded by a shell fired at an exceptionally long range. Notwithstanding this answer, 500&apos; British prisoner of war were placed under the most terrible conditions within range of the Russian guns. The horrors of the march to the camp are established beyond doubt, and the conditions of life during the rigour of a Russian winter, constituted torture of the most deliberate kind; the accommoda-tion and treatment were bad, the men were not allowed to receive any. parcels and were deliberately starved; there was no water supply; suffering from frostbites was general, and many of the men died as the result of the treatment. That this was a de-liberate act on the part of the Higher Command is shown both by the threat of reprisals, which the German Government made, and by the fact that the 500. British prisoner weTe paraded at the camp and a notice was read out to them stating that they were to be subjected to reprisals, that they would have to work in the firing line, get bad treatment, bad food, bad accommo-dation, and that thirty-six of them had to die. At the end of April, 1917, there were only 77 men left in the camp out of 500 driven there in February (23, having died and 400 having been sent to hospital) and of these 47 were certified by the doctor to be unfit to leave their beds. The names of Lieutenant Prahl of the Reserve Artillery and Lieutenant Krael of the 2nd Jager Regi-ment have been given as being in command of the camp where these men were confined.   This camp is variously known under
the names of Latchen or Kalzien. Captain Forster was in charge of the whole commando of 2,000.In the opinion of the Sub-Committee, Lieutenant Prahl and Lieutenant Krael or other the officer or officers in command of the camp at Latchen, Kalzien, on the Russian Front, from the beginning of February, 1917, to the end of April, 1917, Captain Forster or other the officer in charge of the commando of 2,000 prisoners for the same period the local Army Commander or Commanders and the Minister of War during the same period should be held responsible for the offences against British prisoners of war committed at the above camp.Mines and Quarries in Germany.   (Memorandum 3.)The Sub-Committee has considered the cases of five stone quarries, namely, Neanderthal, Neubeckum, Wulfrath, Hagen, Elbingevoden; four coal mines, namely, Borbeck, Augusta Victoria, Aplerbeck and Westernholt; and six salt mines, namely, Beienrode, Heygendorf, Grasleben, Ehman, Gluckauf and Lune-burg, where British prisoners of war were employed.Nearly all the cases disclose evidence (1) that the prisoners were not humanely treated; (2) that the food supplied was insufficient, especially for men engaged in hard manual labour; (3) that the accommodation was in many instances very bad; (4) that the sanitary arrangements were deplorable; (5) that the work given to the prisoners was excessive, having regard to their health and capacity; (6) that they were forced to work under threats and by being assaulted; (7) that they were beaten by sentries and others with impunity; (8) that the life was really a life of slavery.The Sub-Committee have applied the ordinary tests of a prose-cution to the evidence that is to say :  1st. What was the offence against the laws and usages of war?2nd. If there was an offence, can the offender be identified? 3rd. What was the degree of responsibility of the offender,having regard to his position ? 4th. Was the offence committed on his own initiative or washe obeying orders, or carrying out a system? 5th. What is the reliable and admissible evidence availablein support of the charge ? 6th. What would be the probable defence to the charge? 7th. Could the alleged offender be put on his trial with areasonable probability of conviction?It would be very difficult, on the material now available, satisfactorily to prove offence against individual officials at the different mines, partly because of the difficulty of identification, and partly because the responsibility could be shifted from one to the other.For instance, it would be said that they were only carrying out the regulations, that the amount of work to be done was fixed, that the doctor decided whether a man was fit for work or not, that the food available was distributed, that the punishments inflicted were authorised, that the prisoners were insubordinate,
refused to work and attempted to escape, and that with regard to their general treatment, it was the same as that of the German civilians.It will be important, on the question of responsibility, to pro-cure copies of the regulations in force at the different places as to the amount of work, the punishments that were authorised, &amp;c, and to trace the origin of these regulations.A selection should be made of the best witnesses in the case of each mine, and proofs carefully taken to ascertain what they can speak to definitely from their own knowledge. . The Sub-Committee considers it desirable that the persons re-sponsible for the system should be proceeded against, and as at present advised these persons are the commandants of the parent camp, the local army commander and the Minister of War.The German military organisation should be considered in relation to these cases.The Sub-Committee considers it probable that when further evidence has been obtained, charges may be made against the commandants or other individuals in control of the mines and quarries where offences against prisoners of war were committed.German Working Comps on the Western Front. (Memorandum 4.)The Sub-Committee have considered the Memorandum (4) which dealt in detail with the conditions prevailing behind the lines on the Western Front. They are satisfied that the evidence showed that the British prisoners were treated with inhumanity, that they were exposed to shell fire, were forced to work on munitions of war, were underfed and overworked, that the ac-commodation in many cases was disgraceful, that the ordinary requirements of health were completely neglected. They are of opinion that the evidence at present available shows that this treatment was the result of a system which the Germans pro-fessed to adopt by way of reprisal, and which was carried into effect by the orders of the Higher Command. Fort Macdonald (Mons en Barocul) is the cardinal instance of inhumane treat-ment not complicated by overwork. In the other cases terrible effects on the prisoners resulted from the combination of starvation-tion, overwork, defective accommodation, insanitary surroundings and brutal treatment, aggravated in some instances by working under shell fire and working on munitions of war.Your Sub-Committee are of opinion, subject to possible modi-fications when complete evidence is forthcoming, 1. That the following persons should be brought to trial:   (a) The Commandants of Fort Macdonald, the Commandants or Governors of Lille, the local Army Commanders and the Minister of War during the period from January 1, 1917, onwards. (6) The Commandants of all camps on the Western Front where prisoners worked under shell fire or at work directly connected with the operations of war. The evidence on this head is at present very incomplete and much further information will probably be forth-coming from the prisoners who are now returning to this country!

That there is ample evidence that the British prisoners of war were systematically treated with inhumanity in the German working camps behind the firing line on the Western Front, but as there is ground for believing that the list of camps is not complete and as an enormous mass of fresh evidence is now coming to hand it is impossible at the present time to do more than indicate that the system was one which is shown to have emanated from the Higher Command, that the Minister of War was ultimately responsible for it and that it is necessary to consider the effect of the further evidence which will be available before coming to a conclusion on the question what local army com-manders, commandants of camps or other persons should also be held responsible. The Sub-Committee wish to add that on the evidence which they have considered up to the present the com-commandants are hardly every referred to by the prisoners, and that in none of the cases relating to the Western Front which have been investigated is the name of any commandant supplied.The Sub-Committee have been informed by the Hon. Secretary of the Government Committee on the Treatment of Prisoners of War by the enemy what steps are being taken to secure the evidence of the prisoners who are now returning to this country.Each prisoner on landing is required to fill in a card with the name of each camp in which he has been confined and to answer certain questions which have been drafted with special view to the work of this Committee.Up to this date some 70,000 of these cards and answers have been received, and a further 80,000 are yet to be received. Steps are being taken to sort, index and analyse the information con-tained in these documents, and until this has been done it will be impossible even to be satisfied as to the value of the incriminat-ing statements already made or to be certain that the worst cases have been discovered.Your Committee has also passed the following resolution with relation to the discovery of documents in the hands of the enemy, and they desire to refer to the Main Committee the question as to what action (if any) should be taken to preserve such docu ments from destruction :  &quot; That it should be a term in the Treaty of Peace that the enemy Government shall supply in such manner as may. be determined at the Peace Conference&quot; (a) The names of all persons in command or charge of or in any way exercising authority in or over all civilian internment camps, prisoner of war camps, branch camps, working camps and commandoes and other places where prisoners were confined in any of their dominions, or in territory at any time occupied by them, with respect to which such information is re-quired, and all orders and instructions or&apos; copies of orders or instructions and reports in their possession relating to the administration and discipline of all such places in respect of which the supply of such documents as aforesaid shall be demanded.
&quot; (6) All orders, instructions, copies of orders and instructions, reports and other documents in their possession which relate to acts or operations whether in their dominions or in territory at any time occupied by them which shall he alleged by the Allied Govern-ments and the Government of the United States or any of them, to have been done or carried out in breach of the laws and customs of war.&quot; (c) Such, information as will indicate the persons who committed or were responsible for such acts or operations.&quot;Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed)  A. F. Peterson.17th December, 1918.APPENDIX. MEMORANDUM I.History of the Transfer of British Prisoners of War toRussia.Early in 1916 considerable shortage of labour arose at the ports of Havre and Rouen in connection with unloading ships, etc. It was accordingly decided to send there a certain number of ierman prisoners of war from this country in order to relieve the congestion. 750 German prisoners of war were despatched to Rouen on the 5th April, 700 to Havre on the 26th April, and a further party of 500 to Havre on the 6th May. These prisoners were engaged under British supervision in clearing cargo ships of goods other than munitions of war and on other work which did not include handling in any way of munitions of war. The regulations obtaining in the camps at Havre and Rouen were precisely similar to those existing in camps in this country.On the 15th May, 1916, the American Ambassador in London communicated to the British Government the text of a telegram which had been received from the Embassy at Berlin, stating that the German Military Authorities had, in view of this transfer, decided to send 2,000 British prisoners of war to work in Russian territory under German occupation. A subsequent communication stated that these prisoners would be put to work under the same conditions as those obtaining in the case of the prisoners transferred from England to France. . These prisoners were, in fact, so transferred to Russian terri-tory where they were kept under conditions of the most extreme hardship, as can be seen from the evidence collected by the Government Committee, to which it is unnecessary to make further reference here. The American Ambassador was informed on the 15th May that the depots at Havre and Rouen might be visited by representatives of the American Embassy at Paris, the United States of America then being the Power charged with the
care of German interests in this country and in France, and ademand was made by us on the 29th May that similar facilities might be accorded to representatives of the American Embassy at Berlin in regard to the camps in Russian territory where British prisoners were located.In spite of all efforts made by the American Ambassador and subsequently by the Netherlands Minister, into whose hands the care of British interests in Germany devolved on the entry of tbe United States of America into the war, permission to visit tbe camps in Russia (with the exception of a visit paid by Mr. Jackson of the American Embassy to Libau on tbe 16th October, .1916) was persistently refused by the German Authorities, and it was not until June, 1917, that a representative of the Netherlands Legation was able to visit these camps. The conditions had by this time been materially improved, and a comparatively favour-able report was rendered by M. Yan Yredenburch. There is, however, a volume of evidence to show that for a considerable period after their transfer to Russian territory British prisoners were subjected to conditions which were deliberately rendered almost intolerable and to a regime of calculated brutality. In con-sequence of the bad conditions known to exist at the camps in Russia the German prisoners were brought back from Havre and Rouen to England in July, 19.17, on an undertaking that the Germans would then re-transfer the British prisoners in Russia to camps, in Germany, an undertaking which was duly carried out by the German Authorities.MEMORANDUM II.The Conditions in German Working Camps on the Russian Front.In the late Spring of 1916 the German Government informed the British Government that in consequence of the employment of German prisoners in France they intended to transfer 2,000 British prisoners to Russian territory. Accordingly, in May of that year 4 parties of 500 each, known as E.K. 1, E.K. 2, E.K. 3 and E.K. 4, were collected from different camps in Germany and sent to Angersee, Mitau, Wainoden and Libau respectively. The whole were under the command of Landwehr Captain Fdrster (report of Capt. Draudt forwarded by the Berlin Foreign Office to the American Embassy on Aug. 9, 1916). The accommodation at Angersee was admittedly not good, but a fresh camp was pre pared at Talsen, which seems to have been fair. A full descrip tion pf these four camps will be found in Captain Draudfs report from which it is evident that at first the accommodation was unsatisfactory, but by June it had materially improved, and I do not thjnk any charge in respect of it could be supported.The, men were sent out from these four central camps for road making, farmwork and the like to many places of which we have information with regard to the following: Aezenpoth, Aldenr burg? Altauz, Brunnenwiskey, Frankenburg, Garracken, Jacobi, Jwaccwiezi, Kelzien, Neuhausen, Plawen, Rochaison, Volkawich, Wandau ^nd Zerren.
The accommodation at these places was, generally speaking, of the roughest description, the water supply bad or. non-existent, and the sanitary arrangements disgraceful. There are the usual complaints about food and the roughness of the guards, and the punishment of tying to a tree is alleged to have been inflicted in its most brutal form with the victim&apos;s feet off the ground.Complaints made by the British Government led to a visit in June or July by Capt. Draudt, assistant to General Friederich, the General in supreme command of the prisoners of war to the main Courland camps. His report is of importance for the present purpose in that it mentions by name many British N.C.Os. as being reliable men. The statements of some of these have already been taken, and special steps should be taken to obtain statements from them all a list is given below. Another witness whose evidence it is important to secure if possible is that of Petty Officer Picton-Warlow, a man of education, copies of whose letters in the possession of the Prisoners of War Committee seem to show that during the summer of 1916 conditions were not so bad, though other prisoners Moffatt 9026, Cheshire Eegt.; Cooper 8813, Cheshire Regt.; Malcom, Cheshire Regt.; Sheilds, 2nd Seaforths; McCulloch 8295, 2nd Seaforths; and Starr, 4th Dragoon Guards (from none of whom has the Government Com-mittee yet obtained a statement) do not take the same view.The German Government having for a long time refused (for military reasons) to allow neutral inspection of camps in Russian territory at last permitted Mr. Jackson, of the American Em-bassy, to visit Libau in October of 1916. He reported favourably of this place, probably correctly, for by that time it had been got in order, and at least three of the witnesses already examined by the Committee-King, No. 1736, Soder, No. 2204 and Sugden, No. 1832 give a more or less favourable description of the place, the last named saying: &quot; Libau camp was the best I was in dur-ing my detention as a prisoner.&quot;However this may be, the conditions seem to have remained as they were till the end of 1916. By a Note Verbale of the German Government dated January 24, 1917, and received by the British Government February 7, the German Government made com-plaint that a considerable number of German prisoners were being detained by the British in France behind the fighting front. The following words are of the utmost importance: &quot; These prisoners suffer from inadequate food, defective accommodation (only tents being provided in many cases), as well as being subjected to hard work and irregularities in the matter of mails.&quot; They com-plained that some of them were exposed to German gun fire which &quot; has resulted in several of them being killed.&quot;They demanded that the prisoners &quot; should be immediately removed to a distance of at least 30 kilometres behind the firing line and provided there with accommodation in accordance with the season of the year and hygienic needs, further, in respect of their postal arrangements, should be placed on the same footing as British prisoners in Germany.&quot; In default of the British Government notifying their compliance with these demands by the 1st February &quot; a number of British prisoners will be trans-
ferred from camps in Germany to the area of operations in the Western theatre of war where, in respect of employment, accom-modation, food, and the question of mails, they will be treated in a manner corresponding to the practice of the British military authorities&quot; which means, of course, the practice alleged by the Germans, i.e., insufficient food, defective accommodation (only tents), hard work and irregular mails.In reply, the British Government, in a Note Verbale for trans-mission to the German Government, dated February 8th, 1917, gave the explicit assurance that the prisoners received the same food as the British troops, that 75 per cent, were in huts, the remainder being like many British troops in specially warmed tents with floor boards, that strict orders had been given against their being employed within the range of German gun fire though it was regretted that one man had been wounded by a shell which must have been fired at exceptionally long range, thic being the only casualty which had occurred.It is incredible that in any circumstances, and especially after such an explicit assurance by a responsible minister, any persons could be inhuman enough to reproduce in the depth of the rigorous winter in Russia the conditions in which German prisoners were alleged to have lived at Havre and in the neigh-bourhood of Rouen. Yet this was done, and done, as the evidence at the disposal of the Committee makes abundantly clear, by the order of some superior authority in Germany.Within ten days of the date of the British reply, 100 men of the R.N.D. were sent to Libau, where a further 400 were sent, and they were &quot;officially informed &quot; that they would be sent to the trenches between Riga and Mitau and remain within the artillery zone by way of reprisal. On February 25 these 500 men were forced to march 35 kilometers up the frozen River Aa, often through snowdrifts knee deep. Sledges followed to pick up the men who broke down from exhaustion, while the escort of Uhlans drove the stragglers on with lances and whips. Those who fell were robbed of their kit and property. Two sergeants, Gibbs and West (specially mentioned by Capt. Draudt as good men), remonstrated, and were singled out for special ill-treat-ment on the march. Of the 500 who started, 120430&apos; are said to have collapsed on the march. &quot; They were brought in by transport later, but through their lying in the snow they were frost bitten in the hands and feet.&quot;The horrors of this march are established beyond doubt by numerous witnesses.Arrived at their destination, the men were kept waiting outside a &quot; cavalry tent built on the ice of (marsh by) the river. It had wire beds on three racks, the bottom one being about one foot from the ground, so that the weight of a man&apos;s body weighed it down till he was lying on the snow or the ice.&quot;The next morning they were paraded and a notice was read out giving the reasons why they were there.   The substance of
this notice is given in the following words by Hookham, Private, R.N.D.:-&quot; You are here on a reprisal because the English have German prisoners working in the firing line in France. They have bad accommodation, bad food, bad treatment; they are under fire and 36 men have lost their lives.   In return, you are to work here in the firing line and will get bad treatment, bad food, bad accommodation, and 36 of you have got to die.&quot; The substance of this order and the fact that it was read out is given by another witness, Lumsden, A.B., R.N.D., examined by a different examiner and on a different day to Hookham, and described by him as a witness of a high order of intelligence and great powers of observation.   The way in which it corre-spondswith the substance of the Note Verbaleoi the 24th January, already quoted, cannot escape notice, any more than the fact that the accommodation provided corresponds with the complaint that some of the Germans at Havre and Rouen were lodged in tents.   There can he no possible doubt that this order, read out as it was, was inspired if not actually issued by those responsible for the terms of the Note Verbale. - .Lumsden adds several points to the notice, of which one of the most important is the characteristically false statement that these steps had been taken after three months&apos; notice to the British Government, of which no notice had been taken. (It will be remembered that the threat was to transfer men to the Western front, that the reply of the British Government was dated the day after the receipt of the German note, and that the men of the R.N.D. were moved to Libau on February 18th.) But this falsehood of a subordinate is perhaps not surprising, for when the men had been in this place for a week the &quot; German Government informed the Netherland Minister at Berlin, in a Nate Verbale dated March 5th, that British prisoners of war had not yet been sent quite close to the German firing line on the Russian front.&quot;   (Miscellaneous, No. 7, 1918, p. 16.)The threats contained in this notice were carried out to th&amp; letter. The accommodation was bad, the treatment was bad, the food was bad, and numbers of men died, while more lost toes, fingers or hand through frost bite.The tent was a large cavalry tent pitched on the frozen marsh, with a foot or more of snow and ice inside and frequently under shell fire. There were some small stoves, but no fuel or entirely inadequate fuel was provided. The &quot; revier stube &quot; was a wretched peasant&apos;s cottage (in which the guard also was quar-tered) in charge of a brutal sanitater. Men in the last stages of illness were sent by sledge to Mitau. When the thaw came the tent was moved to Pinne, on the other side of the river, where deep mud took the place of snow and ice inside the tent.There was no &apos; water supply; such water as there was, was obtained by melting ice from the river or by digging down into the marsh, where filthy polluted water was obtained. Most of the men had no wash during the whole time they were there.
The treatment was bad. Were it not established beyond the possibility of doubt, the story would be unbelievable. Men were driven out to work breaking ice on the river, felling trees, making and repairing trenches under fire when they could hardly stand, and had to be supported by their comrades to and from their work. One man died while being carried home; another, who had fallen exhausted on his way back to camp, was shot at point blank range by the sentry; while a third man, who did not turn out quick enough one morning, was first abused and then attacked with a bayonet by the sanitater; further investigation disclosed the fact that his sleep was the sleep of death, he had been dead some hours, frozen in his bunk. The only punishment was tying to the post outside the tent for two hours after the men returned from work, under conditions hardly differing from crucifixion. Sergt-major Gibb, of the Gordon Highlanders relates how, having been urged by the Interpreter to write home how they were being treated, he eventually did so: &quot;next day,&quot; he proceeds, &quot; I got the letter back marked &apos; Five days strong arrest.&apos; After being hard at work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., I was tied to the pole from 7 p.m., during 36 degrees of frost.&quot;   This is corroborated by several witnesses.That this treatment was deliberate and; inspired by higher authority is evident from. the fact that Sergt-major Gibb says they obtained a copy of the orders from the guard, which stated &quot; that no mercy was to be shown to us; we were men who had, everyone of us, assisted in stopping the Kaiser&apos;s army from going to Paris; and they were to think of their comrades who were being brutally treated in France. Any soldier failing to carry out these orders was to be severely punished.&quot;The food was bad. It was deliberately so. The guards got three-quarters of a loaf each day, the prisoners, doing hard work, received one-sixth of a loaf. The guards were given good, thick soup, the prisoners, soup &quot; that you could drink straight off.&quot; To such straits were the men reduced that it is recorded by more than one witness that the men became so ravenous that they would eat anything. &quot; There were,&quot; says one (Discoll, Norfolk Regiment), &quot; many unburied Russian bodies lying round the camp. Some men were so reduced that when they saw any bones they would rush at them and eat them like a dog. It was pitiful to see men reduced to such an animal stage.&quot; Another, Sergt.-major Gibb, A. and S.,&quot; I do not wish to give details of the state that some of us were reduced to in their craving for food or of what they picked up to eat.&quot; No parcels were allowed before April, and no letters. When the remnants of this unhappy company returned to Mitau, 20,000&apos; parcels were found stored. Had they been forwarded suffering might have been avoided and lives saved.The men were literally starved. One man says he lost A\ stone in weight.   Many died.The result of this inhuman treatment was what might have been expected. At the end of April, 19.17, there were 77 men loft in the camp out of the 500 driven there in February,
Of these, no fewer than 47 were certified by the doctor, who seems at last to have been allowed some authority as unfit to leave their beds.Not less than 23 had died from exposure and starvation some 16 in the camp the rest in hospital at Mitau, besides those killed by the sentries or permanently injured by shell fire or frost bite.It is not necessary for the present purpose to go into all the harrowing details of this appalling story. The question is who is responsible?There can be no doubt whatever that the suffering endured by this unfortunate 500 were directly due to someone in autho-rity in Berlin. The terms of the notice read out to the prisoners and of the orders given to the guard are in exact accordance with the terms of the Note Verbale of the 24th January, 1917. But, fortunately, the name of some of the actors in this tragedy are known. Captain Draudt, in his report in the summer of 1916, says Landwehr Captain Forster was in command of the whole Commando of 2,000 and of No. 4 Company at Libau. Warrant officer Thies was in command of No. 3 Company at Wainoden, later at Talsen; Warrant officer Mictke, of No. 2 Company at Mitau, and Lieutent Giesse, of No. 1 Company at Angerssee, and later at Latchen or Kelzien.Two names are given as the officers in command at the camp where the atrocities above described occurred. Lt. Prahl of the Reserve Artillery and Lt. Krael of the 2nd Jager Regiment.It is not at present possible to say whether these two names refer to the same man at the same camp. The place where the men were confined is referred to as Latcham, Kalzman and Kalzien. As far as I am able to make out, they are all the same place, for the camp seems to have been in a village of Latcham or Latchen, near Kalzman.The interpreter was &quot; Logeman,&quot; and from all accounts he seems to have been well fitted to carry out the orders.The guard appears&apos; to have belonged to the 46 Landsturm Regiment, from Frankfort o/Oder.It seems to me that Lts. Prahl and/or Krael are immediately responsible for what went on; Captain Forster, if he was still in command during the whole time, and further back there should be discovered someone in the Kriegs Ministerium who gave the order so faithfully carried out. Whether this can be done depends on the Treaty of Peace.N.C.Os. specially mentioned by Capt. Draudt as reliable :   Sergt. Andrews, W. Yorks. C.P.O. Bacon, R.N.D. Sergt. Francis, Cheshire.

MEMORANDUM III.Working Conditions in German Mines and Quarries.I have read the evidence in the following 15 cases:  Neanderthal............

Salt Mine.Heygendorf.........      ...      ,,    ,,Grasleben ............ &apos;,,Ehmen ............ ,,Luneburg ............      ,,    ,,Gluckauf ............Sarsted Salt Mine.I have applied to each case the ordinary tests of a criminal lawyer:  1st. What was the offence or offences against the laws and usages of war ?&apos; .   2nd. If there was an offence, can the offender be identified ? 3rd. What was the degree of responsibility of the offender,having regard to his position ? 4th. Was the offence committed on his own initiative, or was he obeying orders, or carrying out a system? 5th. What is the reliable and admissible evidence availablein support of the charge ? 6th. What would be the probable defence to the charge ? 7 th. Could the alleged offender be put on his trial with a &apos; reasonable probability of conviction?I do not think any case should be put forward for trial unless all these questions can be satisfactorily answered. It may be assumed that in every case coming before the International Tribunal, if that mode of trial is agreed upon, each case will be not only well defended but strenuously fought, and as the object in view is the re-establishment of International Law, the putting forward of weak cases would have a very bad effect. i: Dealing generally with all the cases there is ample evidence :   (1) That the prisoners were not humanely treated. (2) That the food supplied was insufficient, especially formen engaged in hard manual labour. (3) That the accommodation was in many, instances very bad. , -(4) That the sanitary arrangements were deplorable. (5i) That the work given to them was excessive, havingregard to their health and capacity. (6) That the men were forced to work under threats and by being assaulted. (7) That the prisoners were beaten by sentries with impunity. (8) That the life was really a life of slavery. -.
The question then arises as to who can be successfully made responsible for this state of things?It would be said by those in control of a quarry or mine that they had no responsibility with, regard to food, as they dis-tributed such food as they were supplied with, and the same answer would be made with regard to clothing.Sir Reginald Aeland, who has an intimate knowledge of the facts, has pointed out the difficulty with regard to any charge as to food and clothing; that they were not responsible for matters which they could not control; that the questions of food and clothing and work were governed by regulations and, probably, that the Germans were required to do the same kind of work.As to the conduct of the sentries in making the prisoners work and driving them to their work by force, and striking them while at their work; the answer would be that they were carrying out orders; that the amount of work to be done was. not decided by them; that the question as to whether the prisoners were fit for the work was not decided by them; that where the prisoners were treated with exceptional severity it was due to acts of insubordination and attempts at escape.Under the Hague Convention it is provided that prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force in the Army of the State in the power of which they are. Any act of insubordination justifies the adoption towards them of such, measures of severity as may be necessary. This proposition is a very wide one.What I venture to suggest is, that an attempt should be made to formulate charges against those responsible for the system adopted in regard to prisoners at these various camps.Dealing with these cases separately:  Neanderthal.There is only one witness. The complaint of a man who escaped and was re-captured. Some of his complaints were of a very trifling character.Neubeckum.A witness in this case says that bitterness was shown by the Germans (who had not gone to the front) because they were hungry.Another witness says: The matter of food was of no great importance to us as we were living on our parcels, but we thought it right to make the complaint as we knew that in doing so we were giving the authorities a certain amount of trouble.There is the case of a prisoner named Davis who was smoking and having a dispute with his foreman, who kicked him. Davis took up a. pick in a threatening manner and was shot. There was an inquiry and the camp leader was removed.Wulfrath.At this quarry work seems to have been excessive, the sani tary. conditions very bad, the prisoners knocked about, disputes about working on Sunday.     Principal troubles arising from refusal to work.    No identification, and difficulty in fixing responsibility.   Punishment for insubordination.
Hagen.Only two witnesses; very little evidence. Witness knocked about because be refused to work.    No identity.   Carrying out order.Elbingerode.The case in which the men worked were physically unfit. A man named Sherwood had insufficient clothing in a very emaciated condition.Number of other men, 18 or 19, in same condition.Work excessive; knocked about by sentries and sergeants.The cold of the place severe.Want of food and warm clothing the cause of death of two men and illness of others.   Grefreitert a violent man.With evidence of identity, this appears to me to be a case which it would be well to elaborate. The apparently very strong-evidence is qualified by that of Corporal Roberts. He speaks of the cooking being exceedingly well done, and that they were able to buy useful articles at reasonable prices.This case should be carefully considered when additional information has been^obtained.Borbeck.This is described as a Straf Commando, and it is said men maimed themselves to get away. A complaint&apos;is made of a violent assault on a prisoner named Leak for refusing to give information as to the escape of a friend. He was struck with great violence and the bones of his arm broken. He was sub-sequently tried for mutinous conduct.In connection with several complaints about these different camps, trials of some kind appear to have taken place so that the Germans will have their own record.This is a case in which careful examination of Leak would have to be made.Augusta Victoria (Coal Mine). Excessive work.Sentries said it was a punishment camp for them as well as for the prisoners.Civilians complained very much of the amount of work they had to do.Under Military Law; compelled to work. Punishment for refusal; for escape. Work on Sunday. Work at coke ovens. Hunger of civilians. Visits of doctor twice a day.Stories of tricking the doctors sores on legs. Coke under the arms.. Fights with civilians. Visits by neutrals.Question as to whether two deaths were by accident. Great number of witnesses; a good deal of hearsay. -Accommodation and sanitary conditions bad. Great difficulty of making definite charge,
: ,  &quot;. , Aplerbeck. &apos;In this case there is only one witness. *Frank Cannon he refused to work and thought he was entitled to do so. The dispute kept up for clays. The doctors said he was fit for work. The serious complaint was that sentries dragged sick men out of beds to make them work. That all nationalities were treated the same, but the question as to fitness to work was decided by the doctor. This man says the accommodation and sanitary arrangements were good, the washing arrangements good, and we always got a bath when we came up from the pit. The food, from England came in good condition.Evidence may be available that the condition with regard to baths, etc., at the mines was not so bad.This practice of striking men for not working is one that prob-ably obtains in Germany.Westenholt (Coal Mine). :,Ill-treatment. Excessive punishment. Confined, for four or five days in hot cells. Contrast Armstrong^ evidence with Watson&apos;s, who says no ill-effects.It was probably a punishment camp.Complaints through Netherlands Minister.Fully dealt with by Berlin. :Beienrode.It is complained at this mine, work was excessive. The name of the manager of the mine is given Herr Stark and the engi-neer Schwartz, who are described as slave drivers. It is stated that the German civilians did work of a far lighter character; The witness, Andrew Haily Jones, deals with the matter in great detail. The principal complaint is overwork and being kept too long hours in the mine to complete work required.   &apos;The men suffered from sores, but the German. civilians were affected in the same way.  - . ;.Complaint, also, that the doctor was unskilful or very, brutal with his lancet. .The punishments appear to have been very excessive for trifling offences, and the sergeant and sentries thrashed the prisoners with great violence. .  :rThe sanitation was also said to be very bad. Men working in salt mines require careful medical attention...... &apos; &apos;. . :&quot;        . &apos;f- , .&apos; .&apos; ... &apos;Heygendorf.There are three statements in this case Donald MacPherson, H. M. Caffery and W. G. Allen.MacPherson was there for nearly two years. His statement amounts to this: That he was unwilling to work there, at all, and. refused, but was forced to work; that when he. said he was ill, a doctor said he was shamming. ...
M. Caffery, who is by profession a mine surveyor, criticising the mine, described it as unnecessarily unhealthy because the ventilation could be improved, and criticises the medical treat-ment.Corporal Allen says the treatment was good, the accommoda-tion comparatively good&apos;; parcels of food came regularly and that men who were genuinely sick did not have to work.Grasleben.A. Cook, 4th Dragoon Guards, speaks of a party of new prisoners, weak from want of food, being unable to complete their tasks and forced to work extra shifts. Complaints of place being overcrowded, insufficient ventilation and bad sanitary arrangements. Saw no cases of men being brutally used and knocked about.Case of Meich, being struck by sentry for refusing to work, returned the blow, then being brutally beaten. Complaints of medical attendance. Meich very badly treated, made to work when he was unfit.Case of defence would be that his ill-treatment followed on his having struck a German sentry, for which he was tried by court-martial and sentenced&apos;.Another Witness says the sentries used the butts of their rifles, and this treatment was usually resorted to for all offences instead of arrest.Prisoners kept too many hours in mine. Parcels, however, arrived regularly.This is a case which was the subject of a complaint through the Netherlands Legation, and the denial by Berlin of all ground of complaint is most sweeping.The charges made are denied categorically. It is therefore a case which should be inquired into when further material is available.Thomas Kelly says that the name of this Commando was known to be very bad. That it was known as a Straf Commando. That the work was excessive.This witness seems to have exercised his ingenuity to give as much trouble as he could by throwing the machines out of gear. He says if a man was not working properly he would be struck by the guards, who might give him one or two severe blowsi on the head, shoulders or anywhere. He speaks of Russian prisoners trying to escape being fired at, and treated with great violence. The same kind of thing with a Frenchman who tried to escape.There is another case, the particulars of which it is difficult to arrive at, of a private named Burns being terribly ill-treated for refusing to work.There are complaints of men having to work for sixteen hours in consequence of being unable to complete the work in one shift, and being knocked about by the sentries.Corporal Jenkins described the conditions as being very bad, the health of the men bad from want of food and overworks
On going through the Dutch reports on the conditions in the above mines with Sir Reginald Acland, I find that in five of the eases there are no reports; in three cases there are good reports; in three cases there are favourable reports, and in four cases unfavourable reports, but on rather unimportant matters. I understand that the Dutch representatives were educated and responsible men.In Borne cases the conduct of the Commandant was inquired into, and in the case of Bokel and Neubeckum the Commandants were got rid of, and one of them punished, as the result of complaints.Me alleged that the N.C.Os. had dogs which they set on the prisoners.This was positively denied by the German authorities.Gluckauf.The complaint here from William Fair is that the Commandant and Second in Command treated the prisoners, he said, mur-derously.The violence he complains of was knocking about of British prisoners who refused to go down the mine on the first day.This refusal continued for several days until the sentries, with assistance of a number of civilian workmen, forced them to go down.One youth, who is said not to have been in his right mind, was especially knocked about. The sanitary conditions were very bad.Prisoners were knocked about because two of the others had tried to escape. The Russian prisoners appear to have been treated much worse.Luneburg.In this case I do not find a statement from any prisoner, but the condition of things seems to have been the subject of corn-plain t through the Netherlands Legation. The complaint was apparently with regard to British prisoners working in too great heat.The answer from Berlin was that the German labourers were as little the worse from it as the British prisoners.That with regard to the complaint of over-crowding the place was. sufficiently ventilated by four windows and four ventilators and two doors. And it is said the British prisoners had made no complaint of housing or work to the inspection officer.It seems to have been reported that prisoners had sought to escape work by feigning sickness.On the facts disclosed in these case I think that the charges should be made against those responsible for the treatment of the prisoners generally in these mines and quarries, and that would be against the German Staff.Mr. Justice Younger&apos;s Memorandum seems to me also to point to that conclusion.
&apos; The persoris 1 controlling a working camp, I understand, are:  1st.   The Kommandofiihrer, or Commandant.2nd. Feldwebel, or Sergeant.3rd.   Gefreiter, or Corporal. ,   :     4-th. Postern, or Sentries. J&apos;&apos;:5th. Steiger, or Foreman.  &apos;,&apos; It would be important to know the extent of the authority of the.Commandant with regard to punishment; either in respect of work, attempts, to escape, or insubordination. This information would be important on the question of the degree of responsibility of individuals.As I have suggested above, the best kind of charge to formulate would be one against the system adopted, if the identity of those responsible for the system can be ascertained. On such a charge as that, the whole of the evidence, relating to all the different mines and quarries, could be given.Additional evidence will probably be forthcoming with regard to all the cases, as the result of the prisoners who are now coming home making statements.Except in a few cases, there would probably be considerable difficulty in meting a case in respect of the conduct of individuals at one particular mine.Further investigation is clearly desirable with regard to several of these:-... Elbingerode, Augusta Victoria, Beienrode, and Luneburg.There is enough, material disclosed in the evidence already taken to justify a general charge, if it could be decided against whom, the charge should be made that is to say, against which, members of the General Staff.(When the War broke out, Germany was under Military Law and,-I am inclined to think from what I have read, under Martial Law.   (This is not clear and probably not the case).)The form of the general charge would be something on these lines:-That at the following prisoners&apos; camps (setting out then the names of the Stonequarries, Coalmines and Saltmines selected) :-1. the British prisoners were not humanely treated; 2. the work that they were, required to do was excessive, having regard, to their condition and capacity; ]&apos;  3. British prisoners were treated with cruelty and subjected to acts of violence by those in control of the said .   .   camps;4. the accommodation provided was insufficient and im-proper, and the treatment they were subjected to and the conditions under which they were obliged to live were prejudicial to health.On the question of responsibility for the system, it will be important to obtain copies of the regulations in force with regard to work, punishment and so on, and then to ascertain the origin of these regulations.
MEMORANDUM IV.British Prisoners behind the German Lines on the Western Eront.On the 7th February, 1917, a Note Verbale, dated the 24th January, 1917 (Cd. 8988, p. 12), was received from the German Government in which it was stated that German prisoners in France were detained behind the fighting line, that they suffered from inadequate food and defective accommodation, that they were subjected to hard work and irregularities in the matter of their mails, and that some of them had been exposed to German shell fire, with the result that several had been killed and wounded. It alleged that no British prisoners had been detained in the French and Belgian territory occupied by the Germans for any considerable time, and that, except hospital cases, the only British prisoners of war then kept outside Germany were those who had been sent, by way of reprisals, to occupied Russian territory. The Note Verbale went on to say that unless by the 7th February an assurance was received that prisoners behind the British Front would be immediately removed to a distance of 30 kilometers behind the firing-line and provided there with accommodation in accordance with the requirements of the season and hygienic needs, and that in respect of postal arrangements they would be placed on the same footing as prisoners in Ger-many, a number of British prisoners would be transferred from camps in Germany to the Western Front, where in respect of employment, accommodation, food and the question of mails they would be treated in a manner corresponding to the practice of the British Military Authorities, and that British prisoners falling into German hands on the Western Front would, in future be kept in similar conditions within the sphere of operations.The British Government replied on the 8th February, pointing out that the complaints had not any foundation, and that only one man had been wounded by a shell which must have been fired at an exceptionally long range (Cd. 8988, p. 13). As appears from Cd. 8988 (pp. 5 and 23) an agreement was concluded between the two Governments at the end of April, 1917, that prisoners of war should noi be employed within 30 kilometres of the firing lines. The Germans acted up to their threats; but it seems that long before they thought fit to threaten reprisals they were acting in a manner similar to that which followed these threats. The Government Committee and the Foreign Office (Cd. 8988) state that the inhuman methods of the Germans were in force at least as early as July or August, 1916. The evidence which I have read does not go back as far as this; but, on the evidence which I have seen, it is plain that British prisoners were being ill-treated in December, 1916, at Ronssoy (2191) and at Vendhuile (2.191 and 2033), and at Cambrai in November, 1916 (2033). It will be advisable to obtain further evidence in respect of the latter half of 1916. In the early part of 1917 the system was in full operation. It is plain that it was carried on under ;the direct orders, of the responsible authorities.   Not only is
there the threat of reprisals in the Note Verbale to which I have referred, but the prisoners were constantly told that they were to be starved, ill-treated and over-worked by way of reprisals.In the Government Committee&apos;s Report (Cd. 8988, p. 8) is set out a &quot; Notice of Respite to German Prisoners&quot; (see 1055), which was handed to a British N.C.O.,to be read out to the British prisoners at Lille on the 15th April, 1917, and which stated that all British prisoners were in future to be kept as &quot; prisoners of respite,&quot; very short of food, bad lodging, bad lighting, no beds and hard work beside the German guns, under heavy shell fire. No pay, no soap for washing or shaving, no towels, or boots, etc. At Port Macdonald (also called Mons en Barocul) a similar notice was read to the prisoners on the 7th May, 1917 (1833). This notice stated that the German protest against the working of German prisoners within range of gun-fire had not received attention, and that for this reason instructions had been received from the German Authorities that the British prisoners should be made to work under British fire, and that the conditions should be made exceedingly hard for them. Statements of this kind were made to the British prisoners at Fort Macdonald on other occasions, in April and May, 1917 (2282 and 2330), and also at various other places, e.g., Sanchy-Lestree in March, 1917 (764), Lille Citadel in April, 1917 (780), Cambrai in January, 1917 (782), Brebieres, April to July, 1917 (1054), Meurchin, May, 1917 (.1833), Le Porer in June 1917 (1840), Denain in May, 1917 (2521).The camp at Le Porer is said to have been started as a measure of retaliation in January, 1917 (1840), and the witness who describes it states that, as a reprisal, the prisoners, while he was there from June 24th to August 24th, 1917, were not allowed to receive any parcels, and that when he returned to Le Porer towards the end of November, 1917, he and his companions were told that as the English had moved the German prisoners back from the front line they would be allowed to have their parcels. There cannot be a doubt that the German Higher Command was directly responsible for the gross inhumanity which the British prisoners suffered in 1917, and I gather that there is evidence to implicate them in connection with the treat-ment of British prisoners in 1916 reported in Cd. 8988. But the treatment to which I will refer later did not end in 1917.In the spring of 1918 the German Higher Command came, or professed to come, to the conclusion that the British Authorities were keeping German prisoners working in their front lines, and on this ground renewed, or continued, the maltreatment of British prisoners. At Fort Macdonald in April and May, 1918 (2173), at Provin in April, 1918 (1773), at Salome in April, 1918 (1774), the British prisoners were told&apos;that they were suffering by way of reprisals on this ground; in June, 1918, at Aguilcourt (2181), they were informed that they were to be kept there for 13 weeks, because the French had kept the (German prisoners at the back of their lines for 13 weeks, while at Prouvy,April, ,1918, a German General is said to have refused a request
for more food on the ground that the British prisoners were being starved, because the British Navy was starving the Germans (1764).Heads of Complaint.Ike complaints in the evidence may roughly be divided into the following heads:  (1) Yery bad accommodation. (2) Yery bad sanitation. (3) Underfeeding. (4) Overwork. (5) Brutality.(6) Compulsory work on war material. (7) Exposure to shell-fire.There is a mass of evidence in support of these complaints. The most flagrant instance of the first two, and to some extent of the third, is, on the present evidence, Fort Macdonald. In the spring, 1917, there were a number of British prisoners con-fined at this place. A witness (1833) states that when he was there, for ten days, there were from .101 to 135 men in an underground cell which was only ventilated by one window; the only sanitary provision was a tub in the cell itself. During his stay there lie was allowed to wash twice. The prisoners were not allowed out of the cell before the seventh day. The diet consisted of one-sixth of a loaf for each man, a drink of coffee substitute at 7 a.m., thin soup of mangelworzel and a little barley at 12 a.m. and again at 6 p.m. The men by the seventh day were so weak from confinement and want of food that they staggered as they walked, and three collapsed and were removed in an ambulance. Another (2282), who was at the Fort somewhat earlier for ten days, states that 180 of them were in a cell of 25 feet by 15 feet, which had one window 6 feet by 4 feet; nobody was allowed out to wash; for latrines there was a barrel in the cell, which was cleaned out once every four days; the cell was full of vermin; each prisoner had one slice of bread, soup once a day and coffee once a day. Another witness (2330), who was at the Fort for three days towards the end of April, 1917, says that there were from 120 to 130 prisoners in a cell 40 feet by .15 feet on the first floor; there was no water and no means of washing; the sanitary arrangements consisted of large tubs, which were used for defecating and urinating; they were never emptied or removed while he was there, and overflowed on to the floors of the cell. He comments On the offensivenesa of the stench. Rations consisted of a 3 lb. black loaf for every ten men; at 12 a.m. some thin vegetable soup and at 6 p.m. acorn coffee. The men were so enfeebled that at the next place to which they went 26 out of a working party broke down.Sergeant Humphries, who was at the Fort from the 25th April to the end of June, 1917 (?), states that there were 350 men in a room 18 feet by 40 feet, which was filthy and full of lice. He also refers to the tub for sanitary purposes, which in his time appears to have been emptied twice a day, but it overflowed at night on to the floor, where the men had to sleep.   The placa
was so hot that the men could not wear their clothes. He describes the men as gasping for water and giving anything they had for a mouthful, while the guards, he says, laughed and jeered at the men crying for water. They were only allowed a quarter of a loaf, what he describes as poisonous coffee, and a drop of barley water or &quot; saurcraw.&quot; The men, he states, werp beaten and kicked for not moving quickly when they emerged from this prison. &quot;Witness (2361) is shorter, but to a similar effect.In 1918 the German sy3tem at the Fort had not diminished in severity.   Sergeant Crosbie, who was there from 17th April to 13th May, says there were 280, many of them Portuguese, in a room 50 feet by 20 feet.   It was terribly hot, as there was only one window, and the men stripped naked in their attempt to keep cool.   The sanitation was the same as in 1917.   For the first three weeks, he says, they got no water and no coffee.   The men were only allowed out five minutes each day to draw their rations, everyone was lousey and exhausted, and the men often fainted when they got into the air.   In August and September the con-ditions seem to have been much the same (2534).   The men are said to have been then in a very bad condition, covered with sores, and suffering from dysentery, some of them having been confined there since April.   The Sergeant in Charge of parade is stated to have knocked the prisoners about if they were excused from duty by the Eed Cross sergeant.    It seems (2533 and 2534) that, while the British were locked up in this cell, a large party of Italians was allowed considerable freedom and was much better treated.   The rations at this time appear to have been a pint of coffee for breakfast, 11.30 a.m. half bowl of soup made out of horse beans, and at 4.30 tea made of beech leaves and a quarter of a loaf of black bread, with occasionally a little jam or fat about 2 lbs. between 40 men.   The Germans were receiving at this time, according to the witness (2533), two loaves each for every five days, coffee for breakfast, soup for dinner and supper, and some meat.   Another witness (2547) speaks of the period 22nd May to 15th July, when there were 300 prisoners in what he calls the dungeon, gives the same account of the sanitary arrangements, describes the vermin as awful, and says that men were only allowed out at 11.30 a.m. to draw their rations.   This man was wounded, but his wound was never dressed while he was at the Fort, and he states that he never saw or heard of any wound being dressed while he was there.   There were no washing arrangements and no bed clothes; the men lay on wooden boards like the bunks of a ship.   This witness refers to an interpreter who used to knock the men about and who stated that his wife and children were in London.   One man died in consequence of his having been kicked by the Sergeant while he was ill and enfeebled by this treatment.   In April and May, 1918, Private Beaton was at this Fort for six weeks, when there were 300 or 400 men in the room.   These men got so lousey that they had to &quot; lie bare to get peace for a time.&quot;   The weather was very hot and the men&apos; were locked in; they were refused water and fainted from the heat and exhaustion.   About the same time
Private Stark was there for about six weeks. For the first three weeks he says that they had no drink of any kind; that there were about 230 prisoners in what he describes as &quot; an evil smelling, verminous cell.&quot; They were allowed out once a day to draw their rations, which, according to him, consisted of poor stew and \ lb. loaf. He, too, refers to the men sitting about stark naked in consequence of the stifling heat. According to him, one or two men died there, and he himself could not walk out to get his rations without help. These accounts may be, and probably are, in some degree exaggerated. It would be almost impossible for men who had passed through such a purgatory not to exaggerate. Making all allowances, it appears to me that Fort Macdonald is a case of shocking barbarity, and that all persons responsible for the inhuman system which prevailed there ought to be punished. These would include the Com-mandant of the Fort, the Commander of Lille if the Commandant of the Fort was his subordinate, the local army Commander, and, as in the case of the Eastern Front, the Minister of War. In the case of Fort Macdonald the men complained of underfeeding-; as one of the witnesses said, &quot; we had just enough to live on &quot;; but in Fort Macdonald the prisoners had not to work, and tbe acute complaints of starvation arise in the numerous cases in which the prisoners were compelled to spend long hours in hard work.Working Camps.In many of these camps the prisoners were exposed to shelU fire, for instance Provin and Salome, where 14 men were wounded ((1773), Meurchin (1833), Sailly (2002 to 2005, and Private Beaton), Flers (2282); they were compelled to work on war material, for instance, Sailly, where prisoners had to carry cases of shell from the dump up to the line (Private Beaton) and had to load shells and dig ammunition pits (2002-4); Meurchin, where the prisoners had to carry shells to the German trenches or support lines (1833) and dig trenches or dug-outs in the support lines; Cantin, where they had to load ammunition and other war material (2992-4); Flers, where they had to dig gun emplace-ments for field guns, and were punished because they refused to carry up ammunition from a dump (2282); Le Porer, where they had to break up old iron for use as shrapnel (1840); Peronne, where they unloaded shell trains into lorries for the lines (2341, .2335); Ramecourt, where they carried and loaded ammunition ,(2298) and had to clear munition trains, which had been bombed, because the Germans refused to do this dangerous work, and 37 casualties ensued in one day (2530); Chaudardes, where they were set to work to load ammunition on railway trucks, and were kept at this work by two officers with revolvers (2300); Loos, civil prison, where they worked at shell dumps (Private Beaton). In,all these cases the Germans were acting unlawfully. ,Major Gattie has supplied the Sub-Committee with the informa-tion that the British War Office gave strict instructions that German prisoners were not to be employed on work of this kind. . There is much evidence of the rough and brutal treatment of ; the prisoners by their guards, and sometimes by officers, for
example, Vendliuile, where the prisoners were beaten with rifle butts as an inducement to work (2033); Le Porer, where the prisoners are said to have been knocked down by the guards on the slightest pretext (1840); Cantin, where the guards are said to have kicked the prisoners and beaten them with sticks and rifle butts (in-4); Sailly, where the same things happened (2002-5); Vilhrs, where a Prussian Guard (56 Regt. Oil) was guilty of similar conduct (2175); Ecoust, where the sentries and an officer or under-officer in command of the camp, and a sergeant-major under of him, both of the 50 Eegt. VII., are accused of the brutal use of rifle butts and sticks (2175); Rethel, where men who lagged or fell down from exhaustion or illness were kicked or beaten (2206); Maretz, where a man was shot dead by a guard because he stooped down to pick up a packet of cigarettes, and where two men who attempted to escape had to stand to attention for about 12 hours a day for a fortnight and were so beaten by the Commandant and Feldwebel that they had to go into hospital (2283 and 2290); Ramecourt, where the men who were lying on the ground from exhaustion were kicked and beaten to make them resume work (2298-2300), and the guards beat the men with sticks (2351), and men who fell down from exha ustion on the march were prodded with rifle butts and kicked (2530); Amifontaine, where the guards often- kicked and beat the prisoners (2298-2300); Peronne, where the same kind of thing happened, and one man was knocked senseless and died three days after; complaint was made unavailingly to the officers (2335-2341); Brie, where men are said to have been knocked about because they were too feeble to work hard (2335); Bazancourt, where the guards&apos; treatment is said to have been brutal, and no satisfaction could be obtained from the Com-mandant (2353 and 2535); Douai, where the men are said to have been beaten with sticks and rifle butts (2361); Denain, where the men are said to have been punished if they tried to wash and were driven to work with sticks and rifle butts (2621).In these cases, again, there is probably some exaggeration, and much of this ill-treatment may be due to the way in which German N.C.Os. habitually dealt with their own men; but the gravamen of the charge, I think, in nearly all the cases is that the men were driven to work when from underfeeding and illness they were quite unfit to work, and were roughly and brutally treated in consequence of their inability; and the evidence on this head seems to me to be useful in the main as accentuating the charge that they were compelled to work, when under the elementary principles of humanity no such demand should have been made upon them.In many cases the accommodation for the prisoners was decidedly bad; and in some cases the sanitation was execrable, for instance, at Le Porer (June to August, 1917) 150 prisoners were placed in a machine shop, 50 feet by 30 feet, with a sunk tub in the room for all sanitary purposes. During the first month it does not seem to have been emptied more than once, and as the windows were all boarded up, and the tub overflowed on to the floor, the place &quot;stank horribly.&quot;   After the first month
wo large bowls were substituted, but as these were not regularly emptied &quot; the stench was horrible.&quot; Taking this in conjunction with the insufficient .food, it is not surprising to hear that many of the men suffered from boils and dysentery (1840). At Vendhuile the men were lodged in temporary wooden buildings, with no blankets, and the men in the top tier of beds were covered with hoar frost in the winter of 1916-17. A complaint is made of the smell from a hole in the ground, which was the latrine. Here, too, most of the men suffered from dysentery; the men were full of vermin, and about 18 died. In this, as in other cases, the prisoners&apos; boots were taken away (2191 and 2033). At Villers (March, 1918) there were 1,000 prisoners, and one hut which held 100, the rest sleeping in holes in the ground. The place was swarming with vermin, there were no sanitary arrahge-ments and no means of washing (2175). At Ecoust (April, 1918) similar conditions prevailed (2175). At Bazancourt 400 prisoners were put into huts; very overcrowded; for latrines there was a long hole in the ground, which &quot; got into a terrible state. Millions of flies and a terrible stench.&quot; The camp became filthy and verminous, dysentery was rife, and there were five deaths from it in three months (2353 and 2537). At Meurchin (May and June, 1917) the prisoners were placed in stables, and slept on the stone floors without any covering. At Ronssoy (December, 1916), a machine factory, men slept in tiers, lowest on the stones; no mattresses or blankets and bitterly cold (2191). At Flers (May-June, 1917) 200 were in the church; slept on the stone floors without straw; washing not allowed (2282). At Ramecourt (May-June, 1918) there were 2,000 prisoners who had no accommodation; slept on the ground without any covering, with no washing or sanitary arrangements (2298-2300, 2340, 2351, 2530).* At Craonne (June, 1918) there were 1,000 prisoners in conditions similar to those at Ramecourt (2298-2300). At Peronne and Brie (April to August, 1918) the men were shockingly overcrowded in huts (2335-2341). At Douai (April-May, 1917) 280 were in half completed house; there were no baths and the men lay on concrete floors, soaked to the skin. They were covered with sores from lice (2361). Denain (May to July, 1917) was a wire cage with no shelter or blankets, washing being prohibited (2521).The insufficiency of accommodation in the spring of 1918 may, in part, be accounted for by the large captures then effected, but some of the above complaints relate to an earlier period; and the impression left on my mind is that the Germans were quite indifferent on the subject of the accommodation or health of their prisoners behind the lines on the Western Front. In any case, the badness of the accommodation, which must have operated on the health of the prisoners, rendered it more inexcusable to work them hard on insufficient food.It is, I think, necessary to consider complaints of under-feeding and overwork together, for what might be just sufficient food without work would be totally insufficient with work, and,* (2530) this witness speaks well of the Commandant, a Colonel, but Bays that the N.C.O&apos;s. did what they pleased.
on a view of the evidence, I think it is clear that the sufferings of the British prisoners were due to hard work without adequate sustenance in bad and insanitary surroundings. The food allowed in the camps appears to have been more than that which was given to prisoners at Port Macdonald and Lille, where they had not to work; and if, as one of the witnesses (Sergeant Humphries) said, the food there was just enough to live on, the larger amount allowed in the camps might not have been glaringly insufficient but for the fact that prisoners were exposed to&apos;hard work for long hours. The curtailment of rations to the minimum in 1917 at least was deliberate. At Lille and Fort Macdonald the prisoners were told that they were going to be starved (780 and 1055 and 1833). At the risk of repetition I recall the ration at Lille and Fort Macdonald. At Lille, Sergeant Humphries says, the ration was a quarter loaf of bread, barley and coffee substitutes, &quot; just enough to keep us living&quot;; and he seems to have had a similar ration at Fort Macdonald, Another prisoner states that the ration at Fort Macdonald con-sisted of one loaf for every six men, a drink of coffee substitute at 7 a.m., a thin soup of mangold wurzel at 12 a.m. and 6 p.m. (2173). Another says that the food consisted of one slice of bread, soup once a day, and coffee once a day (2282); while another says that rations at the Fort consisted of one 3 lb. black loaf for every ten men, thin vegetable soup at 12 a.m., and acorn coffee at 6 p.in. (2361).On this it is difficult to come to a definite conclusion what the ration at the Fort was; but, from the accounts of the men&apos;s hunger and the previous threats of starvation, I think there can be little doubt that the amount of food allowed at the Fort, was punitively small. One witness. (2533) compares the German ration and, the British prisoner&apos;s ration at Lille and Fort Macdonald in August and September, 1918. A German got two loaves for five days, i.e., two-fifths of a loaf a day, coffee for breakfast, soup for dinner and supper, and some meat, while the prisoner had a quarter of a loaf a day, i.e., one loaf and a quarter for five days, a pint of coffee for breakfast, half bowl of horse-bean soup at 11.30 a.m., and beech-leaf tea at 4.30 p.m,, while occasionally they had about 2 lbs. of jam or fat between 40. men. He observes that 400 Italian prisoners were being treated all right. .In the camps it is difficult to ascertain what the prisoners ration was. If the witnesses are accurate, it would seem to have varied in different camps. For instance, the bread ration at Vendhuile (January, 1917) is said to have been half a pound &apos;(2033); at fillers and. Ecoust (Spring, 1918) a quarter of a loaf (2175); at Flers (June, 1917) one slice of bread (2282); at Ramecourt (June, 1918) a small slice of bread (2298-2300), or one-third of a small loaf (2340), or May to August, 1918 f lb. black bread (2530); at Craonne (June, 1918) a slice of bread (2298-2300); at Peronne (May to August, 1918) one-third of a loaf (2335-2336).(Note.-According to Cd. 8988, a quarter loaf is about   lb.)
One witness, a N.C.O. (2353), makes a comparison of the prisoners ration with the German ration at Bazancourt (June to September, 1918). The prisoner had one pint of barley stew, one slice of bread (400 grammes), and substitute coffee, while the German soldier had the barley stew &quot; with probably a little meat in it,&quot; the substitute coffee, and 700 grammes of bread. This would indicate that the German guard had considerably more food than the prisoners. Whatever the actual ration was, the evidence is overwhelming that it was quite insufficient for men who had to do eight or nine, and sometimes more, hours&apos; hard work a day. The evidence contains constant references to the misery which the prisoners suffered from the combined effects of starvation and exhaustion; for instance, they were glad to pick up nettles, potato peelings, and dandelions (Amifontaines, July, 1918 (2298-2300); at Cantin and Sailly (April and May, 1918). &quot; They were like wild animals with hunger and scrambled for any piece of food which might be lying about &quot; (2002-4). They were punished for accepting gifts of food from civilians, and civilians were prevented from supplying food to them, and were punished, and even fired at, if they tried to supplement the prisoners&apos; ration. (See, for instance, Meurchin (1833), Denain (2521 and Private Beaton); see also instances given in Cd. 8988). There are constant complaints that the men were forced to work when, in their condition of weakness, it was sheer cruelty to expect it. No parcels reached these men who were working behind the lines on the Western Front, and it was therefore impossible for them to supplement their insufficient rations in this way. Probably, as is suggested by the Government Com-mittee Eeport (Cd. 8988), this was due to defects in organisation; but, if the witness (1840) is correct, there is evidence that at Le Porer prisoners&apos; parcels were deliberately withheld. This, however, is the only witness who speaks of the condition of affairs at Le Porer, and I think it would be well that further enquiries should be made with reference to this place. But there is one thing which establishes, I think, beyond question the charge of compulsory overworking on insufficient food, and that is the physical results. The men who, when they were captured, must have been in hard condition, lost weight and became emaciated; they became, in large numbers of cases, covered with boils and sores, dysentery was rampant, and large numbers of the men suffered from swelled legs and feet (in the evidence sometimes called dropsy). These complaints seem to have been common throughout the camps. Two British prisoners who acted as orderlies in the following German field hospitals, Croix Molyneux, 61st Clearing Station, Ham, Clearing Station at Chaulnes, and Hattencourt, state that in May and June, 1918, there was a constant stream of sick British prisoners from the working camps behind the line, that they were in a very bad state of dirt and starvation, suffering from dysentery, and having swollen feet and legs as though suffering from dropsy, so that they could not get boots on and had to slit their trousers up, and that as many as 20 or 30 such cases had sometimes come in in one day (2096-7\; and (as appears from Cd. 8988) a German
professor in charge of a ward in a German hospital in France told a wounded British officer, who asked why British and other prisoners who reached the hospital were so emaciated, that they came from working camps behind the lines, where the conditions were so frightful that he was shocked at them, the men being overworked, under shell-fire, very much underfed, with little clothing and in a filthy condition. The evidence, I think, establishes beyond doubt--(1) That the prisoners received con-siderably less food than the guards; (2) that they were compelled to work hard for eight or nine, and sometimes considerably more, hours a day; (3) that the food which they received was totally inadequate to the labour which was exacted from them; and (4) that disastrous effects on their health resulted. Assuming that the Germans were able to establish that they had not sufficient supplies to enable them to feed their prisoners better, the answer appears to me to be that, as they were bound to treat their prisoners humanely, they ought not to have broken them down by work which could only be required from men who were both better fed and in better sanitary conditions; and in this connection it must be remembered that the evidence shows that the men were forced to work although they were suffering from the complaints which I have mentioned, and were only sent to the hospitals when they dropped, absolutely worn out.Conclusions as to Working Gamps.1. The Commandants of the camps where British prisoners were forced to work under shell fire, or to dig trenches or gun pits, or to handle munitions of war, should, I think, be brought to trial, Or at any rate some of them by way of example. In addition to the camps of this description mentioned above, Gd. 8988 indicates evidence, most of which appears to be hearsay, as to other camps, and I suggest that further evidence on these lines should be sought, particularly with reference to the camps in the neighbourhood of Cambrai and Lille, and Camp E.K. 5.2. The system of inhumanity (rough treatment, under-feeding, over-work, even when sick) prevailed throughout these Camps on the Western Front, and was obviously, in the main, the result of superior orders. I doubt whether it would be advisable to arraign all the Commandants; one of them at least is praised in the evidence. It might be considered whether some selected Com-commandants should be brought to trial, by way of example; but those who were really responsible for this system should be tried and punished.   Who these persons were must be considered.I may add that the evidence in connection with some of the camps is at present very far from complete. There seems to be only one witness as to Le Porer. I have seen very little or no first hand evidence as to working camps at Cambrai, Lille, Ervillers, Marquion, Tournai, Gamp E.K. 5, all referred to in Cd. 8988.
MEMORANDUM Y.The German Military System.1. The German Military System. The general military system of the German Army falls broadly under three headings, which are kept quite separate :  Appointments, under the Chief of the Military Cabinet.Administration, under the Minister of War.General Staff, under the Chief of the General Staff.The three officers* above mentioned are the highest military authorities and act as personal advisers to the Emperor, who is the supreme head&apos; of the Army.2. The Military Cabinet (MilitarvKabinett) issues the Official Gazette and Cabinet Orders, and controls all appointments, pro-motions, transfers, exchanges, retirements, honours and rewards, except for the posting of General Staff officers.The Chief of the Military Cabinet is senior personal aide-de-camp and military secretary to the Emperor, and is, practically, his ear and mouthpiece.3. Ministry of War (Kriegs-Ministerium). Each of the four Sovereign States of the Empire has its own Ministry of War, but, in war, authority is entirely centred in the Prussian Ministry of War, while those of the other States merely arrange local details. Only the Prussian Ministry of War will therefore be dealt with in this note.The Minister of War is appointed by the Emperor, and is the highest administrative authority in the German Army, but exer-cises no military command over the troops in the field.t He is an ex officio member of the Prussian Cabinet, a representative in the Bundesrath and has a seat in the Reichstag.Lieut-General Wild von Huhenborn, who held this appoint-ment during the first part of the War, was replaced in October, 1916, by General von Stein, who commanded the XIY. Reserve Corps on the Somme. The Minister of War is assisted by a Chief of the Acting General Staff (Chef des stellvertretenden Generalstabes der Armee).The Ministry of War, which in peace comprised six depart-ments now consists of eight: -I. Central Department (Zentral Departement, XD).(a) Ministerial Section (Zl).(6) Estimates and Establishments Section (Z2).(c) Publicity Section (Z3).(d) Central Information Bureau (NB).II. General War Department (Allgemeines Kriegs-Departe-ment AD).(a) Army   Section   (Al)   and   Mobilization   Section(Mob. A).(b) Supply of Officers and&apos; Non-commissioned OfficersSection (Cla).* The names of the officers holding these appointments are given in the index to : &quot; The Germa-i Forces in the Field.&quot;t The Minister of War, however, directly controls the Home Army (Heimatsheer).

The new departments formed in the War Ministry during the War are No. IV. (Quartering) and No. VIII. (War Bureau).The War Bureau is the department which is charged with utilising to the full the resources of the country for war.Connected with the War Bureau is a &quot; scientific commission &quot; of 20 leading scientists, who form a technical advisory board; there are also legal and financial experts, and special sections for economic propaganda work in neutral countries and among the troops, and for distributing information among the manufac-turers of war supplies.4. The General Staff. The Staff consists of:  (a) The   General   Staff   (Generalstab),   including   theAdjutantur.(b) The Great General Staff (Grosser Generalstab). The General Staff supplies officers for the whole Army. With few exceptions, every staff officer has undergone a courseof three years&apos; training at the Staff College (Kriegs-Akademie), and has been attached to the Great General Staff, before taking up an appointment on the staff of a Corps or division.The Adjutantur, i.e., the Administrative or Routine Staff, consisted in peace mainly of Staff College graduates who had not been selected for appointment to the General Staff. Adjutan-tur officers hold 2nd Grade appointments on the staffs of Corps, divisions, and brigades.The Great General Staff is an inner ring of selected staff officers working in Berlin and at General Headquarters, directly under the Chief of the General Staff. Its work comprises everything which comes under the heading of Operations, Movements and Intelligence.5. General Headquarters. Up to March, 1917, General Head-quarters (Grosses Hauptquartier) was at Charleville. The Emperor&apos;s General Headquarters was then moved back to Kreuz-nach;* while General Headquarters for the Western Front remained at Charleville. All orders and gazettes concerning the Field Army are issued from General Headquarters, with the exception of administrative and technical orders, which emanate from the Ministry of War.The General Staff at General Headquarters is presided over by the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army, who has a special branch under him, concerned with operations and ammu-nition allotment. The Quartermaster-General (Generalquartier-meister) and a branch of the Ministry of War are also at General Headquarters. In addition, there are the following Directors and heads of departments:  General of Foot Artillery (General von der Fussartillerie). &apos;.;   Director of Railways (Chef des Feldeisenbahnwesens).General Commanding the Air Forces (Kommandierender , :     Gen. der Luftstreitkrafte). Director of Signals (Chef des Nachrichtenwesens), Director of Mechanical Transport (Chef des Feldekraft-,,   . fahrwesens). ...* The Emperor&apos;s General Headquarters was moved to Spa in February, 1918.
Director of Survey (Chef des Kriegsvermessungswesens). Director of Medical Services (Chef des Feldsanitiitswesens).Intendant-General of the Field Army (General-Intendant desFeldheeres).Director of Anti-Aircraft Guns (Chef der Flug-Abwohr-Kanonen).Inspector of Gas Regiments (Inspekteur der Gasregimenter).The General of the Engineer and Pioneer Corps is at General Headquarters on the Western Front.The War Ministry is represented by a Staff at General Head-quarters.6. The Higher Command. The supreme command of the Field Army (Oberste Heeresleitung) is vested in the Emperor as Ober-kommandierender Kriegsherr. The Emperor&apos;s principal adviser with regard to all military operations is the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army (Chef des Generalstabes des Feldheeres), who has under him a special department dealing with operations and ammunition allotment.Early in 1915 General v. Moltke was succeeded as Chief of the General Staff by Lieut.-General Erich van Falkenhayn. He was, in turn, succeeded by Field-Marshal von Hindenburg in August, 1916. Under the Chief of the General Staff is the Erster Ober-quartiermeister, or Deputy Chief of the General Staff (Luden-ludendorff).The Emperor nominally retains the personal command of the main Groups of Armies operating on the Western Front.The higher command in the Eastern Theatre is delegated to the Commander-in-Chief on the Eastern Front (Oberbefehlshaber Gst) and to the Commander-in-Chief in the South-Eastern Theatre.The Commander-in-Chief on the Eastern Front (Obost) has practically a separate General Headquarters, with the following independent directors:  Director of Ammunition Supply (Chef des Feldmunitions-wesens beim Obost), Director of Medical Services (Feldsanitatschef beim Obost). Army-Intendant (Armee-Intendant beim Obost).The forces operating on the Russo-Roumanian Front were formed in two German Groups of Armies and one Austrian Group of Armies. There is, however, a German Chief of the General Staff for the Army front of the Archduke Joseph.The South-Eastern Group of Armies includes the Army Group operating on the Macedonian Front.The German Army operating on the Italian Front in 1917-1918 was nominally under the Austro-Hungarian General Head-quarters.A Group of Armies (Heeresgruppe) consists of two to five Armies, and is commanded by a Field-Marshal or General-Oberst.

FIRST INTERIM REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE FOR OFFENCES AT SEA.Report as to the Persons against whom there is Evidence of Responsibility for Outrages Committed at Sea during the War.Your Sub-Committee was appointed,on November 6th, 1918, and consists of the following members:  Sir John Macdonell, K.C.B., LL.D. (Chairman). : Captain V. Brandon, R.N. (Admiralty). Mr. Maurice L. Gwyer (Ministry of Shipping).    (Added :   December 11th, 1918.):Admiral Sir Reginald Hall, K.C.M.G., C.B. (Admiralty). Mr. T. W. H. Inskip, K.C. (Admiralty). Mr. Herbert F. Manisty, K.C. Sir Ernest M. Pollock, K.C., M P. Mr. C. A. Russell, K.C.Mr. Hugh H. L. Bellot, D.C.L. (Secretary). The Sub-Committee has held three meetings, and a Special Committee, consisting of Mr. C. A. Russell, Mr. H. F. Manisty and Captain Brandon have made an investigation into the material in the possession of the Admiralty, extending over many weeks, relating to outrages committed by German submarine and other naval commanders at sea. The following memorandum was submitted by them to the Sub-Committee on the 20th December, 1918, and was adopted by them. It was presented to the main Committee on 7th January, 1919, and adopted on that date.1. Upon the evidence at present in possession of the Admiralty with regard to the persons responsible for (a) the out-rages committed during the war by German submarines, and (6) the analogous outrages by the German cruisers &quot;B rummer &quot; and &quot; Bremse,&quot; the Sub-Committee recommend :  That the Government take at the earliest possible moment the necessary steps to secure the arrest or preventive detention-tion and surrender of the persons named or designated in the Lists numbered I, II, III, TV and V in the Appendix to this Report with a view to proceedings being taken against them for breaches of the laws of war and of humanity. 2. As the Sub-Committee understand that the proceedings to be taken to obtain the surrender of the German Emperor are already under consideration, his name has not been included in List I.3. With regard to the lists of Officers responsible for outrages by submarines, it may be of interest to note that the Officers responsible for some of the most notorious cases, e.g., Kapitan-leutnant Schwieger, who sank the &quot; Lusitania,&quot; and to whom is attributed the first deliberate attack on a hospital, ship (the &quot;Asturias&quot;); Kapitanleutnant Schneider, who sank the s.s. &quot;Arabic&quot;; Oberleutnant Pustkuchen, wEo is believed to have torpedoed the cross-Channel s.s. &quot; Sussex &quot;; and Kapitan-leutnant Paul Wagenfuhr, who is suspected of having sunk the s.s. &quot;Belgian Prince,&quot; and, after taking the crew on board his submarine, suddenly submerged and left them to their fate, are dead; and that at present there is not, unfortunately, any
evidence to show by whom the Belgian refugee ships &quot; Amiral Ganteaume&quot; and &quot; Harpalyce,&quot; and the hospital ships &quot; Asturias &quot; (which had escaped an earlier attack), &quot; Gloucester Castle,&quot; &quot;Dover Castle&quot; and &quot; Konigin Regentes &quot; were sunk.4. The evidence in some cases identifies the submarine but does not identify the Commander, and in these cases the list specifies the submarine and gives the period during which the outrages attributed to it were committed. It is suggested that in such cases the demand should be for the surrender of &quot;the Officer in command of such and such a submarine in [naming month and year].&quot;5. The following notes are intended to explain the reasons why the persons whose names appear in the several lists were included therein.List I.In the administration of the German Navy,* the absolute head of affairs, both in name and in fact, was the Emperor. Under him there were various authorities almost wholly independent one of another and responsible to him alone. Of these authorities the principal were:  (1) The Imperial Navy Office, presided over by the Secretaryof State. (2) The Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet. (3) The Admiral Staff.(4) The Commander-in-Chief of the High Sea Fleet.(5) The Admiral Commanding the Naval Corps in Flanders.The Chief of the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet and the Chief of the Admiral Staff were of equal rank with the Secretary of State, and did not report to him, but had direct access to the Emperor. There is reason, however, to think that while Admiral von Tirpitz was Secretary of State, his strong personality more or less domi-nated the heads of the other two departments. - (1) The Secretary of State was the ultimate authority under the Emperor on all matters relating to the administration of the Navy. He attended the Bundesrat and Reichstag to state and defend policy and estimates.(2) At the head of the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet was a senior Flag Officer, who at the same time occupied, ex ojficio, a position similar to that of our principal Naval Aide-de-Camp. In this latter capacity he was constantly with the Emperor, was his immediate adviser and assistant with regard to all naval matters, and, in general, the channel through which he made his wishes or commands known to the sea service.In the Office of the Naval Cabinet were kept all &quot; dossiers &quot; of officers, and to it came all -confidential reports concerning them.(3) The Admiral Staff was modelled to some extent on the plan of the Grand General Staff of the Army, and had functions similar to those of the British Admiralty Naval Staff. It was presided over by an Admiral, who may be considered to have been the special technical Naval War Adviser to the Emperor. The business of the Admiral Staff was distributed among a number of sections.    During the war additional sections were* See German Navy p. 100.
created which, dealt with submarine warfare against merchant ships and with questions of law and of internal and international policy arising therefrom. Reports of every cruise made by a submarine were submitted to the Admiral Staff.The Admiral Staff was, in theory, a purely advisory body, and was the organ for the communication of the Emperor&apos;s orders to ships with regard to their military and political employment. It elaborated the plans for the conduct of naval warfare, and during the war issued detailed orders for operations outside the North Sea. As illustrating the functions and responsibility of the Chief of the Admiral Staff, it mav be mentioned that the secret order for the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare was signed, &quot; By order of His Majesty, von Holtzen-ludendorff &quot; von Holtzendorff being then the Chief of the Admiral Staff. j ...........Chief of the Admiral Staff was, as a rule, with the Emperor at Great General Headquarters in the field, whilst the Deputy-Chief remained at the head of the Admiral Staff Office in Berlin.(4) The submarine flotillas, based on German ports, formed part of the High Sea Fleet, and were under the command of the Commander-hvOhief of the High Sea Fleet; and orders relating to submarine operations of importance passed through his hands. It is almost impossible to measure or state precisely the extent of the commander-in-Chiefs influence on, and responsibility for, the conduct of submarine warfare, but it was probably considerable.(5) The Flanders submarine flotillas were under the command of the Admiral commanding the Naval Corps in Flanders, whose authority and position in relation thereto were similar to those of the Commander-in-Chief of the High Sea Fleet with regard to the submarine flotillas based on German ports.There are also included in List L, in addition to the authori-ties above mentioned, the officers who from time to time held the position of &quot; Leader of Submarines &quot; based on German ports, and those who held corresponding positions in Flanders and in the Mediterranean, respectively. Of the German orders relating to ruthless submarine warfare, of which copies have been obtained, many were issued by the &quot; Leader of Sub-marines &quot; based on German ports; and no doubt similar orders relating to his own sphere of operations were issued by each of the other &quot; Leaders of Submarines.&quot;List 11.There is primd facie evidence to connect each of the officers named, and the commanding officer of each of the submarines specified, in this list with the sinking of at least, one ship without warning and with accompanying acts of brutality or callousness which, even if he was acting under the orders for unrestricted TJ-boat warfare, were obviously in excess of such orders.List in.&apos;-There is primd facie evidence to connect each of the officers named, and the commanding officer of each of.the submarines specified, in this list with the sinking of at least one ship
without warning. All these cases occurred after the order for unrestricted U-boat warfare, and there is no evidence that in any of them there were additional acts of brutality or callousness. Where there were casualties they seem to have been incidental to the sinking of the vessel without warning.All officers who were in command of German submarines after the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare may have been guilty to the same extent as those included in this list; but in the absence of evidence to connect them with the sinking of any particular vessel, it has not been thought proper to include them.List IV.This list relates to a few outrages which cannot be connected by even primd facie, evidence, at present, with any particular officer or any particular submarine. But the Admiralty have reasons for believing that they were committed by the sub-marines specified in column 3 of the list, and that the respective commanding officers of those submarines at the time were as showm in column 4 thereof.The &quot; Ikaria &quot; and &quot; Toko Maru &quot; were the first merchant ships to be sunk without warning by torpedo.The sinkings of the &quot; Victoria &quot; and the &quot; Mariston &quot; are stated to have been accompanied by conduct of exceptional atrocity and callousness.The cc Galway Castle &quot; was under escort, and the submarine commander consulted the safety of his own vessel, no doubt, by making off at once. But the ship sunk was a passenger ship only and carried no troops, and 150 lives were lost.List V.The captains of the German cruisers &quot; Brummer &quot; and &quot;Bremse,&quot; the persons designated in this list, were responsible for the sinking, on 17th October, 1917, of the destroyers &quot; Mary Rose &quot; and &quot; Strongbow &quot; and of a number of merchant ships forming the Scandinavian Convoy. These outrages were similar in character to those committed by submarines, and were part of the ruthless warfare on merchant ships. A Court of Inquiry, that investigated the affair, found &quot; that the enemy made no attempt to warn the crews of the merchant ships to abandon their ships before shelling them,&quot; and that they did not &quot; make any efforts to rescue survivors.&quot;There were indignant comments in the Scandinavian press as to the way in which the crews of the merchant ships were left to drown; and reports have been received from various sources that after the effect on Scandinavian opinion had been observed, the captains of the &quot; Brummer &quot;and&quot; Bremse &quot; were relieved of their commands.(The Lists of Names are already in the possession of H.M. Government and of the Committee, and Other names will be submitted from time to time.)Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed)     JOHN MACDONELL.Hugh H. L.

FIRST INTERIM REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE FOR OFFENCES IN THE AIR.Your Sub-Committee was appointed on 19th November, 1918, and consists of the following members:  Sir Ernest M. Pollock, K.C., M.P. (Chairman).Major M. Beachecroet (Air Ministry).Mr. C. R. Brigstocke (Air Ministry).Colonel E. H. Davidson, O.B.E., M.C. (Air Ministry).Mr. Herbert F. Manisty, K.C.Mr. Hugh H. L. Bellot, D.C.L. (Secretary).The Sub-Committee has held three meetings and has con-sidered the charges to be preferred against enemy airmen, viz.: First, wilful or reckless bombardment of hospitals, and secondly, indiscriminate bombardment, without any military objective, of towns and places. In the case of the first class of charges, although we have reason to believe that a prima facie case exists against certain enemy airmen, we are not yet in a position to come to any definite conclusion until the evidence relating to the bombardment of hospitals in France received from that country has been more carefully considered than has been possible since its receipt.In the case of the second class of charges, after examination of the evidence placed before us by the Air Ministry, we are of opinion that a prima facie case exists against enemy airmen of indiscriminate bombardment by them of undefended towns and places in Great Britain, without any military objective. The Sub-Committee therefore recommends:  &quot; That H.M. Government take at the earliest possible moment the necessary steps to secure the arrest or preventive detention and surrender of the persons named or designated in the list of names appended hereto, with a view to pro-ceedings being taken against them for breaches of the laws and customs&apos;of war and of the laws of humanity.&quot;List oe Names.(The list of names is already in the possession of H.M. Government and of the Committee. Other names will be submitted from time to time).Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed)     ERNEST M. POLLOCK.Hugh H. L. Bellot (Secretary).

REPORT OP SPECIAL SUB-COMMITTEE ON LAW. To The Right Honourable The Attorney-General. Sir,You desire, as we understand from the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, that a Special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War should report to you directly, with as little delay as possible, and without waiting for a meeting of the Main Committee, upon the following questions:(1) Whether it is desirable to take proceedings against theGerman Kaiser? (2.) What should be the nature and Constitution of theTribunal for the trial of the German Kaiser? (3) What should be the chief heads of the charges to be preferred against him ? (4) What should be the law to be applied by the Tribunal ? (5) What should be its procedure?These questions coyer a great part of the matters referred to the Committee under the terms of the original reference of November 5th, 1918. They deal with subjects as to which inquiries are not yet completed. We haVe had no opportunity of ascertaining the opinion of the Committee as to some of the most important of the above questions; and the answers which we now give to them are subject to further examination and also to the course which other Allied Governments may decide to take. With this reservation, which we desire to emphasize, our answer to the first of these questions is contained in the following recommendations:(1) That it is desirable to take proceedings against the German Kaiser.This involves a question of policy; but in view of the grave charges which might be preferred and established against the Kaiser, the vindication of the principles of International Law, which he has violated, would be incomplete were he not brought to trial.Moreover, the trial of other offenders might be seriously pre-prejudiced, if they could plead the superior orders of a sovereign against whom no steps had been taken.We are, therefore, of opinion that it is desirable the ex-Kaiser should be brought to trial.(2) That an International Tribunal be established composed of representatives of the chief Allied States and the United States for the trial and punishment of the ex-Kaiser as well as other offenders against the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity. That ELM. Government appoint to such Tribunal (say) six members, four of whom shall be of judicial or legal experience, one a naval, and one a military representative.That the chief Allied States and the United States have like representation,
That, in addition to the members above mentioned, an opportunity be given to such other of the Allied States as in the opinion of the chief Allied States and the United States should be represented to appoint a member or members of the Tribunal. It seems to us that the trial of the Kaiser ought to be by an International Tribunal, free from national bias, the decisions of which would possess unquestionable authority, which would speak in the name of the conscience of the world, which would help to re-establish and strengthen International Law, and which in the future would be a deterrent and warning to rulers and highly placed officials who meditated or instigated offences against Inter-national Law.In the proceedings and decisions of such a Tribunal all States are interested, but not all equally so. For reasons which we need not elaborate, certain States may justly claim a larger share of representation in the composition of the Tribunal. But we have not thought it advisable to suggest the precise proportions in which all the various States should be represented; such a matter being peculiarly one for the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.We have considered, as we understand was desired, the quee-tion whether neutral States ought to be represented upon the Tribunal, and we have arrived at the following conclusions, viz.:That no representative of Neutral States be admitted to mem-membership of the Tribunal, unless for very special reasons.The Special Sub-Committee recognise the apparent advantages attaching to the presence of such representatives; they would lend, it might be said, to the Tribunal a more distinct Inter-national character. There are, however, as it seems to us, decisive objections to their admission. In coming to this con-clusion we cannot ignore the fact that in all probability, having regard to the ethnical, economic and geographical character of certain of the neutral States, their representatives might not be free from pressure or apprehension of pressure. In the course of the war, it may be added, those States which most distinctly represented neutral interests, or which took steps to assert the rights of neutrals, became belligerents.There is also force, we think, in the argument recently advanced by the French Government against the appointment of a neutral representative to a Commission of Enquiry into Bulgarian outrages against Greek subjects, viz., that there is a possibility of an undue tendency on the part of such repre-sentatives to contend that outrages were equally committed by both belligerents. Any expression of dissentient opinion of this character on the part of a neutral representative might seriously compromise the decisions of tbe Tribunal.(3) As to the third question, namely, What should be the chief heads of the charges to be preferred against the ex-Kaiser? It has been suggested that one charge should be based upon his having provoked or brought about an aggressive and unjust war. In the opinion of the civilised world a great crime against humanity and in breach of International Law, wag committed by
the Kaiser in conjunction with his Ministers and military advisers. One of the main objects&apos;of bringing him to trial would be defeated if foremost among the charges to be made against him was not that of having long planned and deliberately instigated an aggressive and unjust war.On the other hand, to the inclusion of this charge there are several objections, not the least important of which is the fact that it might involve a prolonged examination of the whole political situation, the political difficulties and controversies preceding August 4th, 1914, and, indeed, the entire political history of Europe for some years before that date. It might be difficult to set limits to such enquiries, and the effect of entering upon it might be to distract attention from the grave and much more precise charges enumerated below.It is also to be observed that, however morally reprehensible the ex-Kaiser&apos;s conduct in this matter may have been, he may have been acting constitutionally. Under the Constitution of 1871 he was not completely sovereign. The sovereign powers were not vested in him alone. (See Laband, Das Staatsrecht des Deutschen Reiches.   5 ed. 1. 215 as to the Kaiser&apos;s powers.)For a declaration of war in the name of the Empire, the consent of the Bundesrath is required unless an attack is made upon the Federal territory or its coasts.   (Art. II.)His conduct in this respect might be said to be a political act, the guilt of which is shared by the German nation, the repre-sentatives of which were the Bundesrath and Reichstag.But it may be rejoined that the conduct of a sovereign might be constitutionally correct and, nevertheless, might be a grave breach of International Law.The Special Sub-Committee, having considered these con-conflicting views, were in favour of including among the above charges that of having provoked or brought about an aggressive and unjust war.*In any case, the ex-Kaiser&apos;s responsibility, as it seems to us, for acts done or sanctioned by him in his military and naval capacity after the invasion of Belgium, in breach of the Treaties of 1831 and .1839, and of Luxemburg, in breach of the Treaty of 1867, and for the series of violations, numerous and varied, of the laws and customs of war committed on land, at sea and from the air, by the military, naval and aviation forces of Germany, is unquestionable.His position in relation to these forces is thus defined by the Constitution.By Art. 18 the Emperor shall appoint Imperial officials and cause them to take the oath to the Empire and dismiss them when necessary.By Art. 53 the Navy of the Empire shall form a &quot; unity &quot; under the supreme command of the Emperor.   The Emperor is charged with its organisation and construction; he shall appoint&apos; the officers and officials of the Navy, and they and the seamen shall take an oath of obedience to him. &apos;By Art. 63 the total land forces of the Empire shall form one army, which shall be under the command of the Emperor in war and in peace.0 This resolution was carried by four to three. 20962 D
By Art. 64 all German ,troops are bound to render uncon-ditional obedience to the commands of the Emperor. This obli-gation shall be included in the military oath. . . . The officers appointed by him shall take the military oath to him.Proof no doubt will be forthcoming that the ex-Kaiser actually used these large powers; that he was in truth the &quot; War Lord &quot; and &quot; Commander-in-Chief &quot; of the Navy &quot;; and that he took part in the military and naval operations and was in close touch with his officers in such operations.Such being his constitutional position, both in theory and in practice, for all acts ordered or approved by him during the war, whether by explicit order or approval shown by long course of conduct, he is, it is suggested, responsible.The enquiries of the Committee have not reached a stage at which it is possible to state precisely the charges which should be preferred against him. The Committee are still engaged in investigating these matters. The following suggestions are sub-ject to re-consideration, and may be modified by the Committee. But, provisionally, the following heads of charges may be sug-gested, viz.:  1. Waging an Aggressive and Unjust War. 2. Invasion of Belgium and Luxemburg in Breach of Treaties.3. Systematic Terrorism in Belgium and Prance. 4. Illegal Methods of Submarine Warfare. 6. Destruction of Hospital Ships. 6. Directions to give &quot;No Quarter.&quot;7. Promiscuous Bombardment from the Air of UndefendedTowns and Villages. 8. Deliberate Bombardment of Hospitals from the Air. 9. Bombardment from the Sea of Undefended Ports, Townsand Places.10. Execution of Edith Cavell and Captain Fryatt.11. Execution of Civilians in Occupied Territories.12. Ill-treatment of Prisoners of War,13. Deportation of Civil Population in Occupied territories and Forced Labour. 14. Murder of Hostages. 15. Use of Illegal Methods of Warfare.These are mere general indications of the possible charges which at this stage, not knowing the conclusions of the Com-mittee and the Land and Sea Sub-Committees, we have not formulated precisely.(4) As to the fourth question, viz., What law should be applied by the, Tribunal ? It is conceived that the Tribunal should apply the laws and customs of war. In the main, these are contained in the Hague Convention II. of 1899 and Convention IV. of 1907, to both of which Germany was a party, and which may be taken to be, on the whole, an accurate, though not exhaustive, statement of such laws and customs. It is true that1 the regula-tions contained in these Conventions do not apply except between contracting Powers and then only if ?1.1 the belligerents were
parties to the Convention (see Art. 2 of Convention IV. of 1907); which was not the case throughout the present war. But Art. 4 of 1907 states that &quot; the Convention of 1899 remains in force as between the Powers which signed it and which do not also ratify the present Convention.&quot;All the belligerents, as far as we are aware, have ratified the Convention II. of the Hague Conference, 1899.At all events, the regulations probably correctly express &quot; the principles of the law of nations, as they result from the usages established among civilised peoples, from the laws of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience.&quot;There are no comprehensive Conventions relating to the laws and customs of maritime warfare. But there exists Conven-tion II. of 1899, viz.: &quot; Maritime Warfare and the Geneva Convention &quot;; and there are also rules to be found on the subject in the Naval Codes and Prize Law of the chief maritime States, the decisions of Prize Courts and the opinions of autho-ritative text-writers.(5) As to the fifth question, viz.: What should be the pro-cedure of the Tribunal? There are at present, broadly stated, two types of Criminal Procedure, the Anglo-American and the French; the former based upon the accusatory principle, the latter originally upon the inquisitorial. It is suggested that neither should be strictly adhered to. The procedure ought to be as simple as possible, consistently with justice to the accused. The proceedings should be public and mainly oral, and witnesses should be liable to examination and cross-examination. The accused should be entitled to the assistance of counsel. Had the ex-Kaiser been captured in the field he would have been liable to be tried by a Military Court, and some modification of the pro-cedure of such a Court might &quot;be suitable for his trial by the International Tribunal suggested herein.In making these recommendations it should be understood that the Main Committee and the Sub-Committee have far from com-pleted their enquiries, that they are not aware of the opinions and proposals ,o(f the Associated Governments, and that the above recommendations are subject to revision and re-consider a-tion.In conclusion, we desire to express our strong opinion that the article or articles in the Treaty of Peace, providing for juris-diction over the enemy offenders, should, if possible, be drawn in the most comprehensive terms.*Signed on behalf of the Special Sub-Committee,(Signed)     JOHN MACDONELL.

APPENDIX 1,C.B. 1182A. GERMAN   NAVY.. Part II. Section 1.Admiralty AdministrationSubject.- &apos;    Page.Introduction   ...The Imperial Navy Office       ...............The Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet   ..................The Admiral Staff Office.....................SECTION   I.ADMIRALTY  ADMINISTRATION. Introduction.The German Navy in the proper sense of the term has only existed for rather more than 40 years, though, long before the foundation of the Empire, there were of course German war vessels.Prior to the Franco-German war, the North German Confederation had decided to build, within the next 10 years, a Navy consisting of 16 iron-clads, 20 frigates and corvettes, 8 despatch vessels, and 22 gun boats; but before these could well be commenced war broke out, and throughout the war tne then existing German Navy played a very minor part.On the formation of the Empire, the Navy, unlike the Army, became Imperial, and the first real attempt at any organisation was made under General von Stosch, who was appointed Chief of the Admiralty and remained in that position until 1882.General von Stosch was succeeded by General von Caprivi, who remained in office until 1888, but as during thjp tenure of office of both the above-named officers the Navy was treated mainly as a defensive force, practi-cally no battleships were built and little advance was made until the advent to the throne of the present Emperor.One of his first acts was to replace General von Caprivi by an Admiral, and shortly afterwards the two chief posts of Secretary of State for the Imperial Navy Office and Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet were created and filled respectively by Admirals Heussner and Von der Goltz.Under this system of administration, and largely owing to the Emperor&apos;s foresight and energy, in addition to the fact that he made himself Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, the first Fleet Act was passed in 1898.Under this Act a continuous shipbuilding policy was established instead of the previous intermittent arrangements, and a shipbuilding programme laid down to the end of the financial year 1903-1004; and in 1900 a new Act was passed further raising the number of ships to be laid down and making provision as regards numbers up to the year 1920.The Act of 1900 was further amended in 1906, again in the direction of an increase, and in 1908 the age of replacement of battleships, which had hitherto been 25 years, was reduced to 20 years.Further legislation as to the strength of the Fleet took place in 1912, and the result may be summarised by the statement that before the war the strength of the German Fleet had been fixed at 41 battleships, 20 large cruisers, 40 small cruisers, 144 destroyers, 72 submarines, which strength was to be attained in the year 1920.
There is a further factor in the development of German naval affairs in recent years which is of great importance, viz., the construction and subsequent widening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Oanal, which has greatly strengthened and improved the naval position.It will be seen then that since 1898 the history of the German Navy has been one of continuous, rapid and methodical progress as regards material construction, while the necessary increase, organisation, and training of the personnel in all branches has kept pace with the increased requirements.During these years public interest in the Navy had been gradually growing, greatly stimulated by the personal interest taken by the Emperor in the sea service, and by the efforts and widespread organisation of the Navy League, whereby knowledge of naval affairs was diffused among the population throughout the Empire, and a national pride in the Navy, similar to that which Germany has always had for her Army, grew up and became an important factor in the life of the country.Although the Memorandum to the German Fleet Act of 1900 is now ancient history, it will not be out of place to give the following extracts from it, as it lays down the standard at which the new German Navy was to aim and up to which they have been steadily working for the last 18 years; while in the light of later events the strategical considerations laid down in the Memorandum are of special interest.Memobandum to Fleet Act, 1900.1. Necessity for, and Extent of, the Increase of the Navy.&quot; For the German Empire of to-day the security of its economic development, especially its commerce, is a vital question. To this end the German Empire requires not only peace on land but also peace at sea not, however, peace at any price, but peace with honour, such as is its due.&quot; A naval war concerning economic interests, especially commercial interests, will presumably be of long duration, for the object of a superior adversary will be the more completely attained the longer the war con-tinues. It follows, therefore, that a naval war which, after the destruction or locking up of the German naval forces, is limited to the blockade of the coasts and the capture of merchant ships all over the world, would not cost our adversary much; on the contrary, the expenses of the war would easily be defrayed by the simultaneous increase of his own trade. An unsuccessful war lasting even one year would put an end to German seaborne trade, and would therefore have a most disastrous effect in the first place on economic and, as an immediate result, on social conditions.&quot; Quite apart from the consequences of the terms of peace that might have to be made, the destruction of overseas commerce during a war would not be made good for a very long time after its termination, and then to the sacrifices of the war would be added a very serious economic decline.&quot; The Fleet Act [of 1898] does not provide&apos; for the possibility of a naval war against a great naval Power because, when it was drawn up in 1897, the chief point was to ensure the carrying out of the fleet scheme of 1873 in up-to-date material.   .   .   .&quot; The argument to the Fleet Act allowed of no doubt as to the military value of the battle fleet. There it is expressly stated &apos; against the more important Naval Powers the battle fleet has solely the significance of a fleet for surprise attack &apos;; which is to say that the fleet must withdraw into harbour and wait for a favourable opportunity for a sortie.&quot; Even should it be successful in such an action, it will suffer great losses of ships just as the enemy will. A strong adversary can make good the losses we cannot. In a war with a considerably superior naval Power, the battle fleet provided by the Fleet Act can make a blockade difficult, especially in the first stages of the war, but can never prevent it. It will always be only a question of time until it is either beaten or shut up in its own harbours after considerable loss.    Directly this happens20952
mthere is no great Power which can bo more easily cut oif from any maritime intercourse worth consideration whether by means of its own or neutral ships than Germany.&quot; This would not call for the blockade of long stretches of coast, but only of the few large ports.&quot; In the same manner as the trade of home ports, German merchantmen all over the world are at the mercy of a more powerful enemy, Hostile cruisers on the principal trade routes in the Skagerrak and the English Channel, to the North of Scotland, in the Straits of Gibraltar, at the entrance to the Suez Canal, and at the Cape of Good Hope would make German maritime commerce almost impossible.&quot; As to this it is expressly stated in the argument to the Fleet Act: -&apos; In time of peace the protection of trade in every sea is of paramount importance. In time of war it will be the duty of the foreign service cruisers to afford the greatest possible protection to their own merchant vessels.&apos; That is to say, the ships are to do their utmost. What is possible in this respect becomes apparent when it is borne in mind that the Fleet Act provides for a total of 42 cruisers, while, for example, the greatest naval Power of to-day possesses 206 cruisers ready and in course of construction, and has, besides, at its disposal, bases and coaling stations on all the principal trade routes.&quot; For the protection of trade and the colonies there is only one thing that will suffice, namely, a strong battle fleet. -&quot; In order to protect Germany&apos;s sea-borne trade and colonies under existing conditions, only one thing will suffice, namely, Germany must possess a battle fleet of such a strength that, even for the most powerful adversary, a war would involve such risks as to make that Power&apos;s own supremacy doubtful.&quot; For this purpose it is not absolutely necessary that the German fleet should be as strong as that of the greatest naval Power, for, as a rule, a great naval Power will not be in a position to concentrate all its forces against us. Even if it were successful in bringing against us a much superior force, the defeat of a strong German fleet would so considerably weaken the enemy that, in spite of the victory that might be achieved, his own supremacy would no longer be assured by a fleet of sufficient (strength.&quot; For the attainment of this object, viz., protection of our sea-borne trade and of colonies by assuring peace with honour, Germany requires, according to the strength of the great naval Powers and with regard to our tactical formations, two double squadrons of first-class battleships, with the necessary attendant cruisers, torpedo boats, &amp;c.&quot; The number of vessels in commission in peace is governed by the following considerations:  Since the number of ships of the German Navy, even after carrying out the proposed increase, will be more or less inferior to that of other individual Powers, compensation must be sought in the training of the personnel and in the tactical training of the squadrons.&quot; A sound training of individual ships&apos; crews, as well as a sufficient tactical training of the squadrons, can only be secured by continuous commissions in peace. To economise in the latter in peace means that the efficiency of a fleet is doubtful in time of war.&quot; The minimum for peace time is to have permanently in oomitiission a fleet consisting of the newest and best ships as an active fleet, i.c, a fleet of which all the battleships and cruisers are in commission. This fleet forms the school for tactical squadron training, and bears the first brunt of battle in war. It must suffice in the case of the second fleet, which is composed of the older battleships, if only half the vessels are continuously in commission. For squadron training, additional ships must, of course, be commissioned for the manoeuvres. In case of war, this second fleet the reserve battle fleet protected by the active battle fleet, must make up for the inferior training of the individual ships&apos; companies and the lack of squadron training after mobilisation.
Increase of Foreign Service Ships.&quot; In addition to the increase of the home battle fleet, an increase of the foreign service ships is also necessary. ... In order to estimate the importance of an increase in our foreign service ships, it must be realised that they represent Germany&apos;s Navy abroad, and that to them often falls the task of gathering fruits which have ripened as a result of the naval strength of the Empire embodied in the home battle fleet.&quot; Besides, a sufficient force on the spot, supported by a strong home battle fleet, in many cases prevents differences and so contributes to the maintenance of peace with full protection of German honour and German interests.&quot;ADMIRALTY   administration the keystone of the whole system of the administration of the Gorman Navy is that the absolute head of affairs, both in name and in fact, is the Emperor. Under him there are various authorities almost wholly independent of one another and responsible to him alone. In Berlin these authorities are:  (1) The Imperial Navy Office (lieichs-Marine-Amt) which, under the presidency of the Secretary of State, provides and maintains the Navy (see p. ). (2) The Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet (Marine-Kabinett), which deals with most of the personnel matters (with regard to officers) and acts as a connecting link between the Emperor and the Navy (see p.    ).(3) The Admiral Staff (Admiralstab der Marine), which combines our Admiralty War Staff, Operations and Intelligence Divisions (see p.    ). Outside Berlin there are  . (4) The Inspector-General of the Navy. (5) The Commanders-in-Chief of the Baftic and North Sea Stations. (6) The various Inspections.(7) The Commander-in-Ohief of the High Sea Fleet. Before the war there were also  (8) The Oommander-in-Chief of the China Squadron. (9) Officers in independent commands abroad. With reference to these two last, all officers in independent commands abroad were directly responsible to the Emperor for any political or military transactions undertaken by them in the oourse of their duty, which were reported to him through the Chief of the Admiral Staff.It was only in the early part of 1914 that all sections of the Admiralty Administration in Berlin were brought together under one roof. Before that they had all been in different buildings widely separated, but now the three departments, viz. (a) the Imperial Navy Office,(b) the Admiral Staff,(c) the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet,are all housed together in a new building at the corner of Konigin Augusta and Bendler Strassen.The Chief of the Admiral Staff and Chief of the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet are of equal rank with the Secretary of the Navy and do not report to him, and it would at first sight appear that under this organisa-tion friction must necessarily arise between these three independent departments, all having direct access to the Emperor and unable to give direct orders to one another, while delay would in many cases be caused by the necessity of personal reference to the Emperor in the case of a conflict of opinion upon matters of importance.There is reason to think that while Admiral von Tirpitz was Secretary of the Navy his strong personality more or less dominated the heads of the other two departments, but that since he ceased to hold this office the heads of the other two departments have been of as great, if not of more, importance than that of the Secretary of State of the Navy.
However this may be, the efficiency of the Administration of the German Admiralty under the personal supervision of the Emperor, who is Commander-in-Chief of the Navy in time of peace as well as in time of war, though only Commander-in-Chief of the Army in time of war, admits of no doubt,The Imperial Navy Office (Beichs-Marine-A mt).At the head of this is the Secretary of State, who is the ultimate authority under the Emperor on all matters relating to the administration of the Navy. He is a Minister of State, and attends the Bundesrat and Reichstag to state policy and defend the Estimates.The organisation and distribution of work in the office is as follows, according to the Scheme published in the official Marineverordnungsblatt in 1917:-Branch.

(Marine-Kabinett.)This is situated in the Imperial Navy Office in Berlin.At its head is a senior flag officer who at the same time occupies ca ofiicio a similar position to our principal naval aide-de-camp.His staff consists normally of a Eapitdn zur See, a Kapitanleutnant, and a naval engineer.The work of the office consists of making all naval appointments, warning officers of their approaching retirement or non-employment, and issuing all promotions, honours, and rewards.In the office are kept all &quot; dossiers &quot; of officers, and to it come all con-fidential reports concerning them.The chief as senior naval aide-de-camp-is constantly with the Emperor, is his adviser and assistant with regard to all naval matters, and, in general the channel through which he makes his wishes or commands known to the sea service.Naval attaches or other foreign naval officers who may have business with the Emperor must make their applications to the chief of this office.The Admiral Staff.(AdmiraUtab der Marine.)The Admiral Staff is modelled to some extent on the plan of the Grand General Staff of the Army, and has functions similar to those of the British Admiralty Naval Staff. Mobilisation is dealt with by the Imperial Navy Office.It is presided over by an Admiral, who may be considered as the special technical Naval War Adviser to the Emperor.To it belong all Admiral Staff Officers, whether serving at the head-quarters at Berlin or on the staffs of Admirals either at home or abroad. Those serving in Berlin are generally designated as the Grand Admiral Staff.In addition to the above, the Director and Directing Officers of the Naval Academy at Kiel are members, and two military officers of the General Staff are attached to the Admiral Staff. They do not, however, live permanently in the Admiralty in normal times, but visit the offica when required.
niSimilarly, two officers of the Admiral Staff are attached to the Army General Staff.The composition of the Admiral Staff immediately before the war was as follows:  One Admiral   ......,,  Oberleutnant zur See Five Kapitane zur See Three Fregattenkapitane Eight KorvettenkapitaneFour Kapitanleutnants. One Engineer Officer,,  LibrarianChief of Staff, Adjutant to Chief of Staff. Heads of Sections. (One as head of a Section.) (One for duty with Inspector-General of the Navy.)(Also   attached   to   the   Emperor&apos;sNaval Office.) (A Captain &quot; zur Disposition.&quot;)Attached temporarily. One Kapitan zur See        ... (A.d.C. to the Emperor.)Three Kapitdnleutnants.Attached.One Kapitan zur See.,,  Fregattenkapitan. Two Korvettenkapitdne. Three Kapitanleutnants.In addition to the Naval Officers employed there is a numerous staff of civilian officials and subordinate civil employes.As regards the permanent and secretarial staff, two classes of secre-taries are employed, viz., Admiral Staff and Office Secretaries.The former include Geheime Rechnungs Bate) who were transferred from the Imperial Navy Office when the Admiral Staff was formed in 1899; this class is dying out.Since 1901 this branch has been recruited from Assistant Paymasters, secretaries of the Naval Intendance Department and subordinate officers of the Accountant Branch who have passed certain examinations. In addition to other qualifications, candidates must engage to learn at their own expense any foreign language designated by the Admiral Staff.Office Secretaries form a separate branch and are paid at somewhat lower rates than the Admiral Staff Secretaries.Warrant Officers and Petty Officers may be appointed for additional duties, e.g., extra writers, draughtsmen, &amp;c.Orderlies are drawn from the Naval Service.At the outbreak of war the distribution of business was roughly as shown in the following table:  Section.

Press     .........   u. German and Foreign Press.During the war, however, a series of reorganisations have taken place, accompanied by very considerable expansion. Additional Sections have been created dealing with submarine warfare against merchant ships in different parts of the world and with questions of law and of internal and international policy arising therefrom.The Secret Service Section and Contre-Espionage Section have been much expanded, and a special Sabotage Section has been added. There is also a Section charged with the duty of writing the history of the naval war.The Admiral Staff is in theory purely an advisory body and is the organ for the communication of the Emperor&apos;s orders to ships with regard to their military and political employment. To it, therefore, appertain the transmission of sailing orders and the special instructions regarding the political uses of the ships. In these instructions the Foreign Office co-operates, or it may even have originated them.In accordance with this policy all officers in command of, or about to take command of, ships and stations have to attend at the offices of the Admiral Staff for two or three days in order to make themselves acquainted with the problems that may await them at their destination.The Admiral Staff assigns staff work to ships abroad or proceeding abroad, and receives reports on the same both from those ships and from the senior officers on foreign stations who are locally responsible for the staff work of ships under their orders. All Commanding Officers may correspond direct with the Admiral Staff on matters of political and military import.In addition to the foregoing, the Admiral Staff carries out the following duties in peace time:  1. It elaborates the plans for the conduct of naval warfare both athome and abroad. 2. It   collects,   collates,   and   elaborates   all   military,   political,geographical, and technical intelligence concerning the various countries and their navies which may be useful for war. 3. It elucidates all matters that are of importance for the strategicalor tactical employment of naval forces in war time. 4. In concert with the Commanders-in-Chief of the High Sea fleet and the Home Stations, it draws up the yearly manoeuvreprogrammes.5. It conducts historical research and publishes papers regarding maritime warfare, more especially with reference to their , application to the uses of the German Navy, i. It issues handbooks on the navies and resources of foreign countries, on the tactical and strategical uses of ships and armaments, rules for fleet exercises, &amp;c. 1. It makes provision for and supervises the training of suitable officers for Admiral Staff duties. During the war all announcements in regard to naval operations have been signed by the Chief or Deputy-Chief of the Admiral Staff.  The Chief of the Admiral Staff has been, as a rule, with the Emperor at
Great General Headquarters in the field, whilst the Deputy-Chief remained at the head of the Admiral Staff Office in Berlin.At the end of August, 1918, the powers of the Chief of the Admiral Staff were much extendod, and a special Naval War Staff (Seekriegsleitung) - was established at Great General Headquarters. Through the medium of this special staff, at the head of which is a senior Captain, the Chief of the Admiral Staff can now issue orders to individual Squadrons or to local commands.The Chief of the Admiral Staff is directly responsible to the Emperor, and so in theory is entirely independent of the Secretary of State, but in practice their duties overlap. This has caused difficulties, and it is notorious that various Chiefs of the Admiral Staff have been relieved at the instance of the Secretary of State.Except through the medium of the Emperor, the Admiral Staff, till September, 1918, had no means of controlling, modifying, or influencing policy, inasmuch as it might not correspond direct with the Foreign Office or the Imperial Chancellor. A Cabinet Order of 16th September, 1918, however, placed the Admiral Staff in a position to communicate direct with the principal Government Departments and the Imperial Chancellor. Up to this date any necessary modifications had to pass through the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet for counter-signature by the Secretary of State and issue to the Navy, and it was at this point that difficulties arose.The Emperor calls on the Chief of the Admiral Staff for reports on any subject connected with navies or naval warfare, which must necessarily include training, and the latter may bring to his notice schemes for changes of all kinds in connection with the Navy. Yet officially he has nothing to do with shipbuilding programmes, designs or armaments, which are jealously guarded prerogatives of the Central Department of the Navy Office, or with mobilisation, which is supervised by a special section at the Navy Office and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Baltic and North Sea stations. He is, however, frequently consulted regarding these matters.with regard to the High Sea Fleet, the Chief of the Admiral Staff is solely concerned, in co-operation with the Commander-in-Chief, in theoretical considerations of the larger questions concerning the conduct of warfare, hut the Commander-in-Chief (again responsible only to the Emperor) is in no way fettered thereby.During important manoeuvres the Chief of the Admiral Staff has fre-quently hoisted his flag on board a ship of the High Sea Fleet, but did not take command in any way.In common with the Secretary of State and the Chief of the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet, the Chief of the Admiral Staff receives brief daily reports from the various commands at home concerning matters of general naval interest and movements of ships, and he is also informed whenever any ship becomes unavailable for service for more than four days.

Von Tirpitz&apos; retirement was the outcome of the ImperialChancellor declining to adopt at that time von Tirpitz&apos;policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. The retirement of von Holtzendorff and that of vonCapelle, which followed almost immediately, were un-doubtedly due to the failure of the submarine campaign. It is not absolutely certain that Behncke ever took over theduties of Secretary of State, though he was undoubtedlynominated for this post, which eventually was given toBitter von Mann.Note.

German official list of articles of contraband; B. C. and D.  Lists of articles of contraband, alphabetically arranged in the German, English and Swedish languages.Appendix 2:  List in German of Swedish prohibited exports.It is stated in the Preface that the aim of the book is &quot; to facilitate the application of the Prize Regulations.&quot; A perusal will show, how-ever, that one of its main objects is rather to show how these Regulations and every proviso of International Law for the safety of Neutrals can be evaded on some plea of military necessity.Interesting points from a legal point of view are the German idea of what constitutes a recapture (p. 12), and the rules for requisition and salvage (pp. 14 and 15). Apparently the German idea of salvage, i.e., bringing or taking to a place of safety, is theft pure and simple, no receipt being given as for a requisition, and the German vessel being the place of safety.On the whole, it is not surprising that the Germans regard this book as one which &quot; must not fall into the hand of the enemy.&quot;Naval Staff,Intelligence Division,January, 1918.

Corrected up to 26th May, 1917.PREFACE.This book is intended as a book of reference, giving as clearly as possible a brief exposition of the law governing war on commerce. Hence it contains the leading principles of the Law of the Prize Regulations, supplemented by the addition of those exceptions and limitations which in present day war on commerce have to be observed, owing to the existence of spcial treaties, &amp;c.contents. a.page.
In this last respect only is the work exhaustive.On the other hand, as far as the Law of the Prize Regulations is con-cerned, this hook is naturally not intended to, and indeed cannot, take the place of the Prize Regulations; it merely professes to give their fundamental principles, apart from what is more or less unessential, by omitting all those rules, the application of which seldom, if ever, arises in the present stage of war on commerce.The aim of this book is thus to facilitate the application of the Prize Regulations. From the arrangement of the material, however, it follows naturally that the first duty for every officer engaged in war on commerce must always be to make a thorough study of the Prize Regulations. Further he must take these Regulations themselves as his basis when making a decision, especially in all cases of difficulty.For this purpose reference to the numbers of the Prize Regulations is given throughout the text, e.g. (P.B.. 1U)I.-GENERAL.1. (P.B. 2.) War on commerce according to Prize Law may only be carried on against enemy or neutral merchant ships by Commanding Officers of war vessels. Officers commanding prizes do not possess this right.2. (P.B. 4) 5, 81-98.) Prize Law is enforced by holding up a ship  searching her or bringing her into port for examination capture.The captured ship may, in certain cases, be destroyed. See Articles 23, 33, and 34.(P.B. 2.) All 6hips encountered may be held up and searched; neutral Government vessels and neutral vessels escorted by their own war-vessels are always exempt from Prize Law.   (P.B. 5.)For enemy Government vessels, see Article 23(b).3. (P.B. 8.) Prize Law may only be exercised on the High Seas, and not within neutral territorial waters, i.e., within waters which, for a distance of 3 nautical miles from low water mark, fringe the coast together with the adjacent islands and bays. This includes islands, if they are not more than 6 nautical miles distant, and bays, if their coastline is ex-clusively in the possession of neutral States and their entrance is not more than 6 nautical miles wide.A war vessel may, of course, pass through neutral territorial waters in order to hold up a ship outside these limits.International channels are also neutral territorial waters where they are less than 6 nautical miles wide; this must be taken into account in the case of operations in the Sound.Should the ship be held up just on the edge of territorial waters, she should first of all and without any delay be declared captured, and her examination should only be proceeded with after it has been satisfactorily shown that her capture took place outside the territorial limit; should this not have been the case, the vessel should at once be released. In this way alone can the ship be prevented from escaping into neutral waters Before she has been declared oaptured, and consequently having to be released.II.-HOLDING UP A SHIP.4. If a ship is to be held up, she should be ordered to stop by signals and by blowing the syren. Ensign and pendant are to be hoisted at latest when the signal to stop is made. Prior to this the naval ensign need not be flown, and the display of a mercantile flag or a foreign naval ensign is permissible. The use of a privileged distinguishing mark, such as the flag of the Geneva Convention, white flag, or signals of distress is not allowed.
6. If the ship does not stop when she is signalled to do so, two rounds of blank, and, if necessary, a live shell, should be fired over her or across her bows.As regards the case of submarines, see Article 42.(P.B. 88.) If the ship still refuses to stop, the commanding officer compels her to do SO by using force. Force, however, may only be used until the ship abandons her attempt to escape. If the ship is damaged or even destroyed as a result of the employment of force, she has only herself to blame and she must bear the loss. The ship, however, may not sub-sequently be destroyed or otherwise penalised on account of her attempt to escape, but on the contrary she is then to be treated like any other neutral or enemy vessel.Gare is to be taken in determining whether an attempt has been made to escape, e.g. :-(i) The Commanding Officer must make certain that the signals have ^been understood, especially if there is another ship in thevicinity.(ii) In the case of merchant ships, any increase in speed is generallysmall and barely distinguishable from a great distance, as merchant vessels ordinarily steam at full speed.(iii) Some companies have ordered their ships, in the event of their being held up, not to reverse the engines, but simply to stop and allow the ship to carry her way.As regards attempts to escape and active resistance when held up by submarines, see Article 43; as regards the general question, see also Article 25.6. (P.B. 84-) When the ship has stopped, a boarding party consisting of two officers and not more than three men is, if possible, to be sent on board. Officers go on board armed, while the men&apos;s arms are left in the boat. The boarding party can also be constituted so as to form a Prize Crew, if necessary, see Article 12.7. (P.B. 86, 87.) One of the officers the examining officer demands to see the ship&apos;s papers and cargo papers, which he goes through. Repeated refusals on the part of the Master to produce these justifies capture with-out further formality.Conversation with the crew not serving any useful purpose is not to be permitted.The decision to be taken in respect of the ship and cargo should be briefly communicated to the Master, and, In stating the reason of this decision, reference should only be made to the orders contained inthe Prize Regulations. It must be remembered that the enemy and his Press always distort, if possible, the words of German Commanding Officers, in order to make capital out of them for use against Germany herself.Ill-SEARCH, BRINGING INTO PORT, AND CAPTURE.8. (P.B. 88.) Should the ship&apos;s papers disclose nothing of a suspicious nature, or the ship herself not be open to suspicion (see Articles 37 and 38), she is to be released by the examining officer, after he has obtained the approval of the Commanding Officer, and has made an entry in the ship&apos;s log or made out a certificate regarding the result of the search (see Form 1, p. 20). Any complaints made by the Master are to be taken down in writing.9. (P.B. 90.) Suspect ships are to be searched, and according to the result of the search, either released, brought into port, or captured. Since, however, for military reasons or because of the nature of the cargo, search can seldom be carried out at sea, it is advisable for suspect ships at once to be brought into a German port in order to undergo a more thorough search. In such cases a ship shall only be declared captured, if, during her voyage to a German port, it is necessary to take her through neutral territorial waters.
(P.B. 95.) The capture of a ship is effected by a communication in protocol form to the Master, by placing a Prize Crew on board and by hoisting the naval ensign. If it is found impossible to carry out all these formalities, the mere fact of hoisting the naval ensign or the hauling down of the ship&apos;s colours on the order of the Commanding Officer constitutes the act of capture.10. (P.B. 85, 91, 95.) Should anything, for example, bad weather, pre-vent a boarding party from being sent on board, a suspect ship is to be brought into port without further formality. Should it be necessary at the same time to declare such a ship as captured, she must be ordered to haul down her flag and to follow the war vessel.11. It must be clearly stated in the Prize Report whether the ship has been captured or merely brought into port for search; in the latter case the reason must be given, for example, whether search was impossible for military reasons or owing to the nature of the cargo, weather, Ac.IV.-RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PRIZE OFFICER.12. (P.B. 106, 107.) A captured ship will, as a general rule, have a Prize Crew placed on board her, the composition and equipment of which is decided on by the Commanding Officer on the basis of special orders or according to his own judgment. It is desirable that the men forming the Prize Crew should have served in the Mercantile Marine and be familiar with the customs of the Merchant Service.13. (A) The Prize Officer is in Command.(P.B. 12^-131.) The Prize Officer acts as Commanding Officer of the captured ship, and in this respect he possesses the same rights and duties as the Commanding Officer of the war vessel that has captured the ship.He is responsible for the navigation of the vessel. The crew, how-ever, must carry out their former duties under his orders. As regards the case of a ship to be brought into port, see Article 14.(B) Precautions against Attack by the Crew.Should the crew attempt to regain control of the ship, he must act with firmness and prevent them from doing so.In this connection he should, for example, have all hatches but one closed and place a guard over the hatch left open.All arms are to be surrendered.(C) Action to be taken in case of Resistance.(o) (P.B. 126, 104.) Should the crews of enemy or neutral ships offer active or passive resistance to the measures authorized underPrize Law, the most extreme means of compulsion are to beadopted, if necessary, to overcome this resistance.(6) If the persons participating in such resistance have not other-wise been rendered incapable of doing any further harm, they are to be placed under arrest.(c) On the delivery of the vessel in harbour a report is to be handed in, apportioning the blame to the persons concerned.(D) Seizure of Papers.[P.B. 108.) When the ship has been brought into port the Prize Officer must take possession of all papers. If possible, a list is to be prepared and the papers are to be arranged in order, packed up, and sealed (the Master&apos;s seal being used).(E) Attitude towards Passengers and Crew.(P.B. 104.) No special measures are to be taken in regard to the pas* passengers and&apos;crew on normal occasions. The authorities will decide to what extent they are to be given their freedom on arrival in port.
(F) Removal of Goods.(P.B. 127) (a) The Prize Officer, in the presence of the Master and on giving a receipt, may take from the cargo, stores, and provisions, any article which he may require in the execution of his duty.(b) In the case of enemy ships it is desirable to make the Master of the ship taste the food before meals.14. In the case of a ship to be brought into port, the Prize Officer does not possess the same comprehensive rights. He is to take over the naviga-tion of the vessel only in the case of absolute necessity, e.g., on approach-ing the German coast, or on passing through a minefield only known to himself, &amp;c.It is advisable merely to give the Master a general order to steer for a port named, and at the same time to inform him that he is responsible for the navigation of the ship until the Prize Officer expressly takes it over. In other respects the rights of the Prize Officer are confined to such measures as will prevent the ship from escaping from his control. As regards the case of a captured ship, see Article 13 (A), above.V.-PROCEDURE AFTER BRINGING THE SHIP INTO PORT. 15. Handing over the Vessel.The vessel is to be handed over:   In Cuxhaven: to the Barrage Commandant.In Wilhelmshaven (anchor in the Marientief): to the Captain of the Port.In Kiel, Swinemiinde, and Zeebriigge: to the representative of the Admiralty Staff.In other ports: to the representative of the local Senior Naval Officer if there is one, otherwise to the port authorities.VI.-REPORTS REQUIRED.Preliminary Remark.The brief telegraphic report, mentioned below, which is to be substituted for the Prize Report made by the Commanding Officer under Prize Regula-tion No. 93, is to give: the name and type of ship, nationality, size, time and place of holding up, bringing into port or capture and the reasons for this, also the name of the ship which has held her up, brought her into port or captured her.Example: Russian S.S. &quot; Dragonera &quot; 4,000 tons, captured August 3rd, off Staberhuk, by S.M.S. &quot; Stralsund,&quot; signature   ....16. The Captured Ship is put in Charge of a Prize Crew. (P.B. 96). (a) Prize Report.The form of Prize Report (one copy only) is to be filled in by the Com-manding Officer and handed to the Prize Officer for delivery on his arrival in port. The brief report made out as a telegram for the Chief of the Admiralty Staff, in the form given above, is to be handed to the Prize Officer at the same time.(&amp;) Report to Admiralty Staff.The telegraphic transmission of this report to the Chief of the Admiralty Staff by the Prize Officer after bringing the ship into port, or by the representative of the Admiralty Staff, with the further information that the ship has been brought into port, will be accepted in this case by the Admiralty Staff, both as the Prize Report of the Commanding Officer required by No. 96, and also as the report of the Prize Officer required by No. 130 of the Prize Regulations. (This alteration in regard to No. 96 has been made merely in order to relieve smaller vessels, engaged in war on commerce in home waters, of the necessity of filling in a second form of Prize Report.)

VII-ENEMY SHIPS.22. An enemy ship is one which is entitled to fly an enemy flag. The right to fly the enemy flag appears in the ship&apos;s papers which every ship must carry on board. The contents of these papers alone determine the point, not the fact which may sometimes be known to the Command-ing Officer, that the owner is a subject of an enemy State, unless at the time proof is forthcoming that the ship&apos;s papers have been falsified.Should no documents be found from which the nationality of the ship can be definitely established, she may be treated as an enemy vessel.23. (P.B. 10, 112.) (a) An enemy ship is unable to capture. She may be destroyed, if it appears inexpedient or unsafe to bring her into port.The cargo, or its port of origin or destination, is not to be taken into consideration as no compensation need be paid for anything on board. The whole cargo shares in every respect the fate of the vessel destroyed. An enemy ship may, therefore, also&apos; be destroyed when she is proceeding merely from one neutral port to another.(P.B. 123.) The ship&apos;s papers, and especially cargo papers, should, how-ever, if possible be removed and sent together with the Prize Report direct to the Admiralty Staff.   (See Form 2, p. 20.)(&amp;) Enemy Government Ships come under the laws of war without further formality, i.e., the Prize Court has not to decide whether their sinking or capture was legally justified. But they may not be sunk as a matter of course or without warning, unless they are war vessels or troop transports. Government ships, other than war-vessels, are ships used for Government purposes and ships under Government command, besides all ships which are the property of the State.In all such cases, however, Prize Reports are to be prepared and trans-mitted direct to the Admiralty Staff.VIII.-NEUTRAL SHIPS WHICH ARE REGARDED AS OP ENEMYCHARACTER.24. (P.B. 12, 15.) A ship which has been transferred from an enemy to a neutral flag since the outbreak of war is to be treated as an enemyVessel, unless the Commanding Officer is convinced that the transfer would have been made even had the war not broken out; for example, in the way of inheritance. In other respects, where a transfer of flag is in question, the provisions of Prize Regulations Nos. 10-15, are to be applied.Former German ships, condemned as prizes in an enemy country and afterwards sold to neutrals, are liable to capture as the transfer of flag took place after the outbreak of war. These ships, if possible, should be brougl t into port. If this is impossible they may be destroyed. See, how-ever, Recapture, under Article 26.25. (P.B. 16, b. 83.) A neutral is to be treated as an enemy ship if she offers active resistance to the measures authorised under Prize&apos; Law. An attempt to escape does not in itself constitute active resistance;it justifies, however, the application of force until the ship desists from such attempt. See, however, Article 5, p. 5. An attempt to escape renders the ship suspect and therefore justifies her being captured and brought into port without further formality. If, however, the ship is not liable to confiscation on other grounds for example, on account of carrying oontra-band or rendering assistance contrary to the laws of neutrality, she may not be sunk for attempting to escape, nor, if it is impossible to bring her into port, may any other disadvantages be imposed upon her by way of punishment.Active resistance does not only consist, however, in the ship herself offering direct and active resistance to capture, such as firing on, or attempting to ram the war-vessel. It is constituted just as much by the ship held up summoning the assistance of hostile war-vessels in the vicinity and causing them to attack the German war-vessel in order to facilitate an escape. Ordinary wireless signals of distress (S.O.S.) do not constitute such resistance; wireless messages must be intended to summon hostile forces.
As regards attempts to escape and the offering of active resistance when held up by submarines, see Article 43.26. As regards unneutral service by a neutral ship, see Prize Regula-tions Nos. 48-56.The most important case is that referred to in Prize Regulation No. 55 (c), where &quot; the neutral ship is chartered by the Enemy Government.&apos;&apos; The ship herself must be definitely chartered by the enemy Government. It is not enough, therefore, for a neutral ship to be conveying a cargo intended for the enemy Government, nor for the neutral ship to be chartered by a private firm, unless it is plainly proved at the same time that the private firm is acting only as a cover.IX.-NEUTRAL SHIPS.27. Neutral ships are those which are entitled to fly the flag of a neutral State (compare Article 22, p. 9).28. Neutral ships, so far as they do not come under the head of &quot;Vessels not open to Suspicion&quot; (see Articles 37, 38), are. subject to the regulations concerning the Law of Contraband, Blockade Law, Unneutral Service, and Convoy.For the Law of Blockade, see Prize Regulations Nos. 57-80.As regards Unneutral Service, see Prize Regulations Nos. 48-56 (see Article 26 above).As regards Convoy, see Prize Regulation No. 5.As regards Contraband, see following Articles 29-34.29. Contraband consists only of such articles as are included in the list of contraband, and, in addition, are suspected of being fox an enemy destination. Both conditions must be fulfilled. The principles of contraband, therefore, do not apply if, for example, the article in question is included in the list of contraband but is not suspected of being for an enemy destination, or if articles are found which are not on the list but are destined for the enemy. In the case of contraband it is. immaterial whether it is enemy or neutral property, but an article must never be treated as contraband merely because it is enemy property.In addition, the suspicion of enemy destination must not be con-tradicted by Other Circumstances. For example, a ship is encountered carrying a cargo of wheat &quot; for a neutral Government or to the order of this Government.&quot; (The Bill of Lading, for instance, runs as follows: unto the Dutch Government and to his or their assigns.) Among the ship&apos;s papers, however, is found a reliable declaration by the neutral Government, stating that they are already the owners of the wheat. In such case there certainly exists a suspicion of enemy destination on the strength of the Bill of Lading &quot; To order.&quot;   But this suspicion is con-tadicted by another circumstance, namely, by the fact that the neutral overnment is also the owner, and it must therefore be assumed that the wheat is destined only for the neutral Government. For exception, see Article 31.30. (P.B. 21, 23.) Tor lists of contraband arranged alphabetically and with remarks, see Appendix/31. Suspicion of enemy destination.(P.B. 30, 32, 33.) In this respect, as a general rule, there is no longer any difference between absolute and relative contraband as far as the decision of the Commanding Officer is concerned.He may assume an enemy destination in the case of any prohibited article:(a) If the prohibited article is destined for and is directly en route to an enemy country, irrespective of the person or the authority there to whom it is consigned and irrespective of whether it is to order or not.(b) If the prohibited article is consigned to order, or to some con-signee not defined in the papers (for example, a shippingagent), no matter where the consignment is en route to.* Not reproduced.-7V.
(c) If the prohibited article is consigned to, and is en route to, anenemy country, via neutral territory, whether it be consigned to a person or to some authority in the enemy country.(d) If the.prohibited article is addressed to a person established ina neutral country, but this person is an agent or dealer for the enemy  Government, or has supplied  prohibited  goods directly or indirectly by an enemy country during the war. The names of agents, dealers and persons mentioned under (d) will be, as heretofore, communicated in the Secret Information under I.  The Commanding Officer can, however, go beyond this information, if, in any particular case, he possesses proofs against a person to whom prohibited goods are consigned. (P.B. 30.) In addition to the above principles, the following must benoted in the case of absolute contraband; should the ship touch at anenemy port before arriving at her neutral port of destination, the enemydestination of the absolute contraband is fully established, even if itis proved by other circumstances that the goods are not, in fact, intended for the enemy.Example: If, in the case mentioned above under Article 29, saltpetre had been shipped instead of wheat, the saltpetre would be liable to seizure under any circumstances.X-DESTRUCTION OP A NEUTRAL SHIP.32. (P.B. 41, 42.) Contraband is liable to confiscation and seizure. The carrying of contraband can, however, at the same time result in the seizure of the ship. A ship with contraband on board is, therefore, according to the regulations, to be captured and brought in. There can be no question of the destruction of the ship or contraband, except under the conditions laid down in Articles 33 and 34, p. 12.33. (P.B. 113.) The destruction of a neutral ship is permissible only if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:  (a) If in bringing her into port the war-vessel is exposed to danger, or the success of the operations in which she is engaged is thereby imperilled; this condition obtains, for instance, if the war-vessel cannot spare sufficient men to form a Prize Crew, or if the neutral ship cannot follow the war-vessel, or if the presence of hostile forces in the vicinity causes apprehensions of her recapture.(6) If the ship is liable to seizure, because the contraband as reckoned by value, or weight, or volume, or freight dues, amounts to more than half the cargo (P.B. ^2).Not only must both conditions be fulfilled, but the Commanding Officer must expressly state in the Prize Report that they did obtain^(P.B. 115.) If the first condition was not fulfilled, compensation woulor have to be paid for the ship and the whole cargo, regardless of whether they were or were not liable to seizure. If the first condition was fulfilled but not the second, compensation would have to be paid in any case, not only for the ship, but also for the whole portion of the neutral cargo which was not liable to seizure.Special care should on that account be taken in appraising the value in accordance With paragraph (b); in cases where it is doubtful if that part of the cargo which is not contraband does not exceed that portion which may be contraband (see Article 29, p. 10), all articles in the cargo which are not definitely known to be contraband, must be omitted from the appraisement. For example, the following should not be regarded as undoubted contraband: Machinery, machinery parts, iron, iron ores, iron tubes, steel tubes, &amp;c, unless it has been ascertained that these general terms serve merely to cover actual contraband, e.g., tool machinery for the manufacture of war material, raw material for shells, raw haematite iron, haematite iron ore, &amp;c.(P.B. 123.) Ship&apos;s papers and especially cargo papers should always be secured and transmitted, together with the Prize Report, direct to the Admiralty staff.  (See Form 3, p. 22.)
XI -DESTRUCTION OP CONTRABAND WHEN A NEUTRAL ship is RELEASED.34. (P.B. 121.) If the ship is not liable to seizure in conformity with Article 33 (b), the surrender of the contraband may be demanded, andthe contraband itself destroyed, if the conditions of Article 33 (a) apply; the neutral ship is at the same time to he releasedThe cargo papers, referring to that portion of the cargo which has been destroyed, should be secured and transmitted direct to the Admiralty Staff, together with the Prize Report.XII-POSTAL MATTER.35. The treatment of postal matter is governed by the following rules:  (a) Parcel Post is to be treated as cargo, and is therefore subject tothe conditions laid down in the Prize Regulations regarding contraband.(b) Letter Post: Postal correspondence found at sea is inviolable.This applies also to Russian postal matter, Prize Regulation No. 7 notwithstanding.  Letter post includes printed matter.(c) As regards postal matter in ships brought in, see Article 16 (c),p. 8.(d) The luggage, letters and other documents carried by an enemycourier are not to be regarded as postal matter, but should, on the contrary, always be confiscated.XIIr.-RECAPTURES.36. (P.B. 98.) Recaptures are ships taken from the enemy by German naval forces, which the enemy himself had previously captured on the grounds of the laws of prize or contraband, but as regards which no decision had as yet been pronounced in the enemy Prize Court.Any such ship is only to be treated as an enemy ship, if the enemy employs her for belligerent purposes. In all other cases the ship may be captured and destroyed only if she is liable to capture and destruction by German forces according to the provisions of our Prize Regulations. The ship is, therefore, to be treated in the same way as any other ship that is held up.Prizes already condemned by the enemy Prize Court are enemy ships and are to be treated as such.   See also Article 24, p. 10.XIV-VESSELS NOT OPEN TO SUSPICION.37. Preliminary Remark:-The following provisions hold good only outside the barred zones unless the contrary is expressly stated. Within the barred zones all sea-borne traffic will be dealt with in accordance with the declaration regarding these zones.Vessels not open to suspicion may be held up and searched, but, wherever they are encountered, they must be allowed a director passage to their port of destination, when once it has been established that they are not open to suspicion.Should there be in any particular case some well founded suspicion that the certificates mentioned in Article 38, below, have been falsified or are being misused, the ship is to be brought into port. Should this be impossible, the certificate produced is to be removed, together with those sbip&apos;s and cargo papers from which the suspected falsification or misuse may afterwards be proved. Such a ship may only be destroyed if the Commanding Officer has complete proof of the falsification and if the ship cannot be brought in.
88. (P.R. 6.) The following ships are not open to suspicion:-(a) Hospital ships, inside and outside the barred zones, except:  (i) inside the area bounded by the line Flamborough Headto Terschelling on the one side and the line Ushant to Land&apos;s End on the other;(ii) in the  Mediterranean,  where  Order  0  is  to  befollowed.*(b) Vessels employed exclusively in coastal fisheries, or smaller vesselscarrying out local services, as long as they take no part what-ever in hostilities. Coastal fisheries do not include high sea fisheries. In dealing with the latter, proceed in accordance with Order 0, especially in regard to the Norwegian, Dutch and Spanish high sea fisheries.(c) Neutral vessels in possession of a Swedish, Danish, or Norwegianguarantee form. (See Form 4, p. 23.)(d) Neutral vessels with timber Cargoes from Swedish ports, provided they have the certificates on board required by the Special Agreement with Sweden, under XVIII. A., p. 16.(e) Neutral vessels which produce a German pass allowing them a free passage to their port of destination (for example, one issued by the representative of the Admiralty Staff), see Special Agreement, Regulations for traffic in the Sound, &amp;c, under XVIII. C, p. 17.(/) Neutral vessels carrying food supplies of Danish origin direct from Danish to British ports, see Special Agreement with Denmark under XVIII. B., p. 16.(g) (i) Vessels of American nationality if they have contraband onboard which is not war material, see Special Agreement with America, under XVIII. D., p. 18, particularly the list of articles regarded as war material, (ii) Neutral vessels encountered outside the barred zones on their way to the ILS.A. are to be treated in accordance with Special Regulation No. 1, under XIX. Memoranda, p. 19.(h) (i) Spanish ships proceeding from Spain or the Canary Islandsto French ports outside the barred zone, or French Morocco outside the barred zone, provided they have on board a safe conduct from the German Embassy or a German Consulate showing that their cargo is composed exclusively of fruit.(ii) Spanish ships outside the barred zones proceeding to the U.S.A., provided they have on board a safe-conduct from the German Embassy or a German Consulate showing that their cargo consists exclusively of fruit of any kind (fresh, dried, or preserved), olive oil, wine, cork (cork-wood, raw and worked, cork bark, cork meal).It is expressly stated in the safe conduct that this ceases to be valid if the ship enters the German barred zones.(iii) Neutral ships outside the barred zones proceeding from Spain to French ports situated to the westward of &quot; Le Point de 1&apos;Espiquette,&quot; and outside the barred zone, provided that (a) the cargo is destined for the Swiss Government; (6) the Spanish Government guarantees that the shipscontain no cargo for Germany&apos;s enemies; (c) there is a certificate on board from the  GermanEmbassy or a German Consulate showing&apos; that theconditions laid down in (a) and (b) have been com-plied with.(t) Vessels specially indicated by name.(k) Vessels bound for German ports in the North Sea or Baltic, and vessels of German nationality or belonging to one of her Allies.* This order is not available. Tr.
(I) Swedish ships passing through the Sound into the Baltic bound for Swedish ports, provided they comply with the conditions of the Special Agreement given on p. 17, under XVIII. C. 3. In the Baltic the provisions of this Special Agreement must always be borne in mind.(m) The Dutch Government vessel which enters the barred zone every Thursday for the purpose of supplying the North Hinder Light-&apos; ship (see Special Regulation No. 2, under XIX. Memoranda, p. 19).XV.-TdE RIGHT OP REQUISITION.A. Outside the Barred Zones.30. (P.E. 110.) German war vessels may, in case of necessity, remove from the cargo, stores, and provisions for their use and consumption (a) in the case of enemy ships: any article;(b) in the case of neutral ships: articles which are contraband (seeArticle 25, p. 10) or which the Master hands over voluntarily or in return for payment, or which are salved in accordance with Article 40.Private property is not to be touched under any circumstances and the same applies to the ship&apos;s ensign. A list of articles removed must be appended to the Prize Report J if possible the Master should be given a form of receipt.B. Within the Barred Zones.The same principles apply as in the case of A, except that from neutral ships, only such articles may be removed and only such quantities of these as are absolutely necessary for continuing the cruise.The list of articles removed should be transmitted to the Admiralty Staff through the official channels.A. Outside the Barred Zones.40. Any articles may be salved even though there may not be any immediate need of them, subject, however, to the following limitations:(a) Private property and the ship&apos;s ensign are not to be touched.(b) Any articles salved, which have not subsequently been expendedas the need arose, should be handed over together with a list to the competent authorities in harbour. The Prize Report must contain a reference to the salvage.B. Within the Barred Zones.With the exception of articles removed in accordance with Article 3P, nothing must be salved from neutral ships. Any articles may be salved from enemy ships, but in this case also the provisions of Articles 39 mustue observed.Notes to Articles 39 and 40.The Right of Requisition and Salvage should be exercised in such a manner as not to wound the national susceptibilities of neutrals or to afford justification for reproaches directed against the crew of the German war-vessel.Instances have occurred where articles have been wrapped up in the ensign; chests, &amp;c. are also said to have been ruthlessly broken open in the presence of the ship&apos;s crew. Such a thing must on ho account occilr again.Provisions and equipment of lifeboats must not be touched.XVI.-SUBM A RINES.41. Submarines are to be guided in the first instance by the special orders which they receive.If they are waging war on commerce in accordance with the Prize Regu-lations, they are to observe the foregoing articles, except in so far as Articles 42 and 43 below permit them to adopt a different procedure.
42. When holding up a ship, submarines, instead of firing blank rounds, may at once fire live shells across her bows, as it is generally impossible to see bland rounds at any great distance (see also Article 5, p. 5).(r.R. Si.) Submarines have the right to order the Ship&apos;s Papers of a vessel held up to be brought alongside in a boat. Prize Regulation No. 81 no longer applies in the case of submarines.43.-Holding up, Examination, &amp;c.(a) (P.R. 112.) If it is established without doubt that the ship held up is an enemy vessel and she cannot be brought in, a search of^ the ship is unnecessary. She can simply be informed by signal that within a reason-able time the crew must abandon her with tho papers. After being abandoned the ship is to be sunk. When the Commanding Officer has satisfied himself that his order has been understood, but nevertheless the crew have not obeyed it, he will compel them to do so by using force.(P.R. 123.) If possible the ship&apos;s papers and cargo papers should after-wards be secured.(b) (P.R. 123.) In the case of a neutral ship the ship&apos;s papers and cargo papers should be examined when brought alongside, before any further action is taken. If the Commanding Officer is satisfied that his order to bring the ship&apos;s papers alongside has been understood, but it is not complied with by the neutral ship, he is justified in threatening touse force.If the neutral ship still fails to obey, she is to be considered as offerng active resistance and consequently to be treated as an enemy vessel, provided that the Commanding Officer has satisfied himself that the refusal to obey orders can not be due to a misunderstanding.Note. It has happened that when, after holding up a ship, the sub-marine has dived in order to approach nearer to her, submerged, the ship has resumed her voyage because she concluded from the disappearance of the submarine that she herself had been released. In such cases it should not be regarded as an attempt to escape unless the Commanding Officer has informed the ship of his intention. The fact alone of the ship proceeding away can never be regarded as active resistance. See also Articles 25 and 5, pp. 10 and 5.XVII-TREATMENT OF CREWS OF SHIPS ENCOUNTERED.44. (a) Enemy subjects may be removed from any ship held up, and made prisoners. (This naturally applies to men only.) Prize Regulations Nos. 100-103 no longer apply to enemy subjects.An exception is made in the case of Japanese and Italians. They are to be treated in accordance with the Prize Regulations.It is desired that at least the Master and the Chief Engineer of enemy ships should be brought in.A neutral ship, however, should not be brought in merely because she has enemy subjects on board. This should only be done if the transport of enemy subjects is such as to constitute unneutral service in the sense of Prize Regulations Nos. 47 to 55.(b) (P.R. 100-103.) Neutral subjects should, as a general rule, be allowed to go free. If, however, the neutral ship has offered active resistance (see Article 25, p. 10, and Prize Regulation No. 160), or if she has participated directly in hostilities (Prize Regulation No. 83a), the crew should be made prisoners.45. Prisoners brought into port in accordance with Article 44 are to be handed over on arrival in harbour. The Senior Naval Officer and the Admiralty Staff should be informed without delay, in order that a decision may be reached as to the future disposal of the prisoners.XVIII.-SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.A. Swedish Timber Export.-Timber Agreement. I. Neutral Ships leaving Swedish ports with cargoes of timber and pro-ceeding to neutral ports or to such enemy ports as lie outside the barred zones (see, however, under II.) may pass freely notwithstanding the provisions of the Prize Regulations, if they have on board the following certificates:
1. A certificate from the Swedish Customs at the port of departure, stating that: ...(a) the cargo of timber is solely of Swedish origin;(b) the cargo does not contain fire-wood, pit-props, or anyother article regarded as contraband.   (See Form 5, p. 24.) -2. An affidavit from the shipping company showing that the ship is really bound for the port outside the barred zone specified in the shiip&apos;s papers and will discharge there.3. In the case of a European port of destination, an affidavit from the consignee, if necessary, transmitted telegraphically, stating that the consignment will not be forwarded to the barred zone.For the certificates specified under 2 and 3, corresponding guarantee declarations given.by a neutral Government on behalf of the shippers or the consignees may be substituted.Cargoes of timber for Norway must have a Guarantee Declaration from the Norwegian Government instead of the certificates mentioned under 3. If this is not on board the cargoes are to be dealt with in accord-ance with the Prize Regulations.A German pass may be issued in place of one or all of these certificates.II. This Timber Agreement does not apply to neutral shipsi encounter-tered inside the barred zones; nor does it apply to neutral ships encountered outside these zones, if they are bound for enemy ports lying Within a barred zone. The latter ships will be dealt with in accordance with tho Prize Regulations, whilst the former will be attacked in accord-ance with the barred zone declaration.B. Danish Export op Food Stuffs. Food-stuffs Agreement.Neutral ships with foodstuffs Of Danish origin, proceeding direct from Danish to English ports, are to be allowed to pass freely in the North Sea outside the barred zone&apos;s.The expoirt of food-stuffs of Danish origin to England by an indirect route, or to countries other than England, and. the export to any countries of food-stuffs not of Danish origin is to be dealt with in accord-ance with the Prize Regulations.This- Agreement does not apply within the barred zones, where the pro-cedure is to be in accordance with the barred zone declaration.Ships coming under this Agreement will, as a general rule, have on board a certificate signed by the German Legation in Copenhagen and worded as follows:  It is hereby certified that the S.S......................owned by.............................................which steamship leaves........................via......................directhas on board no articles other than provisions of Danish origin (butter, eggs, bacon, milk, beer, fish, &amp;c)......&apos;.............the..............................191   .C. Traffic in the Sound, &amp;c.Regulations for dealing with traffic passing through the Sound, Little Belt and Kaiser Wilhelm Canal.1. Neutral ships which according to their papers carry no absolute or onditional contraband are to be allowed to pass through the Sound, Little . Belt, and Kaiser Wilhelm Canal when trading between neutral Countries, if in the particular instance there is no reasonable suspicion that the ship, nevertheless, has contraband on board.2. Ships in the Danish and Swedish &quot;Coasting Trade are also to be allowed to pass through the Little Belt and Sound respectively, if, in the particular instance, there is no reasonable ground for suspicion that they carry contraband.* This provision covers not only small vessels employed in the local coasting trade and coastal fisheries, mentioned in Prize Regulations No. 6 (b), but also all other vessels plying in these island waters.
Swedish Coasting Vessels entering the Baltic are to he allowed,to pass even if they have contraband on board, provided the conditions mentioned below under 3 are complied with.3. All Swedish Ships passing through the Sound into the Baltic and bound for Swedish ports with absolute or conditional contraband on board are to be allowed to pass through the Sound without subsequently being examined at Swinemunde, provided that:  (a) the goods are on the Swedish prohibited export list; and (6) the Masters of these ships, at the request of the German Gom-manding Officer in the Sound, furnish affidavits to the effect that the ships will proceed direct to their Swedish ports of destination.4. All other Neutral Ships entering the Baltic with absolute or con -ditional contraband on board will be examined at Swinemunde or Kiel.All ships, entering the Baltic through the Little Belt, which would be taken out of their oourse if sent into Swinemunde before proceeding to &apos; their port of destination, will be examined at Kiel.5. Ships bound for NeutraL Countries, proceeding from Danish or Swedish Baltic Ports with absolute or conditional Contraband on board, will be examined at Kiel or Swinemunde. Ships leaving the Baltic via. the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, and those proceeding through the Little Belt from ports of departure which would entail their going out of their oourse unduly to call at Swinemiinde, will be examined at Kiel; all other ships will be examined at Swinemunde. .No Examination will be made if the following Certificates are on board:  .(a) a customs certificate from the port of departure, stating thatthe cargo agrees in fact with the ship&apos;s papers and is solely of native origin;(b) an affidavit from the Shipping Company, stating that the ship isin fact proceeding to the neutral port of destination given in the ship&apos;s papers and that she will discharge her cargo there; and(c) if the port of destination is in Europe or Northern Africa, anaffidavit from the consignee, if necessary transmitted tele-. graphically, stating that the cargo will remain in the neutral country and that it will only be disposed of by sale or other-; wise on the condition that it is to be consumed there.Instead of the, certificates mentioned under (b) or (c), guarantee declarations may be issued by the neutral Government in question.Ships which fulfil the foregoing conditions, or which after examinar * tion have received a fierman pass, issued by the Admiralty Staff,or their Representative at Kiel, Swinemiinde or Cuxhaven, are to be allowed a free passage to their port of destination in addition to being passed through the Sound, Little Belt or Kaiser Wilhelm Canal.6. Ships bound for Enemy Ports will always be examined at Swine-mtinde or Kiel. ......D. Peusso-Ambeican Treaty.The Prusso-American Treaty of 1785, 1799 and 1828 is to be inter-preted as follows until further notice:  (a) American Merchant Ships laden with contraband, which is not war material in the sense of the list given under (b), are to be allowed to continue their voyage unmolested. (&amp;) American merchant ships with war material on board are liable tq.be brought into port, captured or destroyed, if the war material, as reckoned by value, weight, volume or freight dues, amounts to more than half the cargo (see Prize Regulation No. 47).. If this is not the case, the part of the cargo forming the war material may naturally be thrown overboard,
The term &quot; War Material &quot; is to be considered as covering the following articles:  (i) Arms of all kinds, including sporting weapons, together with their component parts, where these are recog-nisable as such.(ii) Projectiles, explosive charges and cartridges of allkinds, together with their component parts, where these are recognisable as such.(iii) Gunpowder and explosives specially intended for use inwar.(iv) Gun mountings, ammunition wagons, limbers, provisionwagons, field forges, together with their component parts, where these are recognisable as such.(v) Military clothing and equipment which can be recog-nised as such.(vi) Military   apparatus   of   all  kinds  which   can   berecognised as such.(vii) Saddle, draught, and pack animals which can be usedfor war purposes.(viii) Camp equipment and its component parts, where theseare recognisable as such.(ix) Armour plates.(x) War ships and other war-vessels, and such parts of them as, owing to their special properties,. can only be used in a war-vessel.(xi) Tools and appliances used exclusively for the manufac-ture of war material, or for the manufacture and repair of arms and naval or military war material.(xii) Airships and aeroplanes.(xiii) Motor cars.(c) It should be ascertained in all cases whether any transfer of flaghas taken place during the war. If, under Prize Regulations Nos. 12 to 15, it is not necessary to reco^pise such transfer, the ship is to be treated like any other neutral, ship.held up.(d) As compensation must always be paid when American propertyon board American ships is destroyed (to this extent only is the Treaty binding), it is necessary to determine as carefully as possible whether the compensation tq be paid is in just proportion to the damage inflicted on the enemy.(e) Vessels in the service of the Belgian Relief Commission, Rotter-dam, whatever their nationality, have free passage to their port of destination, if they bear the prescribed markings and have a German safe conduct on board.Markings:In addition to the ensign, a white flag with the inscription &quot; Commission Belgian Relief, Rotterdam &quot; in red, and a similar inscription on the shig&apos;s sides.Safe Conducts:For the voyage to Rotterdam, on condition that the ship&apos;s cargo is exclusively for the Relief Commission, safe conducts are issued by (a) The Swiss Minister in Washington or the Swiss Consul-General in Montreal for ships sailing from North American ports.(b) The German Minister in Buenos Aires for ships sailing from the Argentine.(c) The German Minister at the Hague for ships whose cargohas been purchased afloat by the Relief Commission, for the voyage from the British port of call to Rot-terdam.Safe conducts for the return voyage from Rotterdam are issued by the German Minister at the Hague on condition that the ships have no cargo for England on board.&quot; All safe conducts contain the notation that they are only valid outside the barred zones.
XIX-MEMORANDA. Special Regulation No. 1.Until further notice the U.S.A. are to be regarded as a neutral country in the sense of the Prize Regulations. Imports are therefore to be dealt with in accordance with the Prize Regulations.But, in order to prevent the growth of American war industries, the following rule is laid down:  In doubtful cases, the assumption mentioned in Prize Regulation No. 31, paragraph 2 (5) Consignment to a person who has delivered contraband to an enemy country during the war is always to be adopted in tbo case of articles included under Prize Regulation No. 21, (1), (2), (3), or of the following metals or their ores (including pyrites): haematite raw iron, copper, tin, zinc, lead, nickel, wolfram, vanadium and manganese.Special Regulation No. 2.Every Thursday the Dutch Government sends a Government vessel from Flushing into the barred zone for the purpose of provisioning the North Hinder Lightship.The vessel is to proceed by day only. She has only one mast. Prom July 1st the vessel will bear the following markings:  &quot; The name &apos; Vlissingen &apos; on both sides, amidships. The Dutch ensign painted on both sides, forward and aft, and extending from the deck to the water-line. At the mast-head, a blue flag with a jack, white and red horizontal, in the upper corner next the mast. An extra large Dutch ensign at the ensign staff. Both flags are made of thin plating.&quot; Should the vessel be encountered, before July 1st, it is possible that she may be flying the pendant of a man-of-war.The vessel is to be allowed to proceed.F_mCertificate.Examined on........................at........................A.M......................P.M.Signature...................................................Stamp of Half Flotilla or Vessel.,    The number of the boat must not be given.

Hospital ships bearing the prescribed markings are excepted from this rule, provided they are encountered outside the area bounded by the lines; (Jshant Lands End, and Flamborough Head Terschelling; also hospital ships encountered within the last-mentioned area up to midnight of 3-4 February.Neutral steamers, Belgian Relief ships and unarmed enemy passenger steamers are to be dealt with in accordance with the Prize Regulations up to midnight of 6-7 February within the barred area in the North Sea, and up to midnight of 12-13 February in the rest Of the barred area; from then onwards, they are to be treated as enemy ships within the whole of the barred area.Neutral sailing vessels are to be dealt with according to the Prize Regu-lations up to midnight of 10-11 February within the barred area of the North Sea, and up to midnight of 28 February-1 March in the rest of the barred area.(2) Outside the barred area, unarmed merchant vessels are to be dealt with according to the Prize Regulations. Armed merchant vessels are to be attacked without delay.(3) In order to intimidate neutral shipping, it iB most important that the initial effect produced shall be as striking as possible. Later on, it is more important that the stations in the barred area shall be occupied as con-tjnuously as possible.(4) The operational area of the Naval Corps is bounded to the Eastward by the line Flamborough Head Tersehelling Lightship.The dividing line between the two operational areas in the West will be arranged between the Commander-in-Ohief of the High Sea Fleet and the Naval&quot; Corps according to requirements, particularly as regards mining operations.A5) This order must not fall into the hands of the enemy and is only to made known so far as is absolutely necessary for its execution.By Order of His Majesty.

(to the Southward oi tuo Gironde).Mines will only be laid inside a 3-mile limit round the coast, except in the case of the Royal Sovereign and Owers Lightships, the areas round which (to a distance of 3 miles) must also be considered as infested with mines.Important points for making a landfall, in particular TJshant, tht) Scillies, and further, the channel between the Scillies and Lands End, will remain free from mines. *(b) For Work with Torpedoes and Guns.Submarines of the High Sea Forces occupy, in the first place:The area between the Scillies and Ireland......

The following communication has been received from the Admiralty Staff:(1) The bringing in of prizes is urgently desired, if the undermen-tioned metals, raw materials, &amp;c, are contained in any con-siderable quantities in the cargo: Gold, platinum, nickel, wolfram, vanadium, molybdenum, chrome, copper, tin, quick silver, antimony, rubber and balata of any kind, asbestos, wool, cotton, fabrics of bast fibre (hemp, jute, flax, ramie) and their products (textiles of every kind, cordage, &amp;c.), vegetable and animal fats and oils of every kind.
(2) Further, the bringing in of a ship is desirable when considerable quantities of the under-mentioned objects are on board:   Foodstuffs and fodder, leather and hides, arms, shells, gun-powder and explosives, and products suitable for their manu-facture; war material of every kind, steel and iron wire, barbed wire; implements suitable for the manufacture of arms and ammunition and war material; industrial machinery and tool machinery of every kind; all ores; aluminium, zinc, lead; iron alloys; sheet-iron and steel for the construction of ships; resin, colophony, mineral oils (lubricating oils, oil fuel, gas oil, Ac). Admiralty Staff B. 96 I of 7.1.17.II. In oonnexion with the above, attention is again drawn to the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the High Sea Fleet G. 7739 A4 of 1.12.16. As laid down in this Order, it is usually inadvisable to bring in ships which are held up beyond the line of patrols to the North of England, as there is considerable chance of the prize being lost. Oh the other hand, it is always advisable to bring in ships held up in the North Sea, even when the cargo is not of particular value to us, on account of the consequent acquisition of tonnage. ,III. In addition, in all cases where any kind of suspicion attaches to a ship chat is encountered (for example, the suspicion of a false Customs certificate) and when search at sea is not possible, it is permissible and desirable to bring in the ship to be searched (not as a prize). If the suspicions are confirmed by the search, the seizure of the ship will be ordered at the place of search (generally by the Barrier Commandant, Cuxhaven). If the suspicions are not confirmed, the steamer will be allowed to proceed without compensation.IV. Ships being brought in (whether as prizes or for purposes of search) are to make List. A prize crew is always to be placed on board them, even if this can only consist of one man. (Compare K. d. U.

American passenger steamers running between U.S.A. and England are also to be allowed to pass after 12 midnight of 12-13 February, and Dutch passenger paddle steamers running between Holland and England are to be allowed to pass after 12 midnight of 6-7 February; provided they comply with the conditions prescribed to them, as follows:1. American Steamers:(o) Only one steamer may run each week from U.S.A. to Falmouth and vice versa.(b) Arrival   at   Falmouth,   Sunday;   departure  from   Falmouth,Wednesday.(c) These ships are to make the position 50o N. 20o W. and the Scillies,on both the outward and homeward journey. The ships steam 14 knots on an average and will therefore pass through the barred area on the prescribed course to England approximately during the period from Friday to Sunday, and on the return journey approximately during the period from Wednesday to Friday.(d) Markings on ships: Hull and superstructure painted with alternatered and white vertical stripes, 3 m. [9-8 ft.] wide, large red and white check flag at each masthead, American ensign aft. At nightfall, the painting and ensign of the ships are to be made recognizable at the greatest distance possible, and the ships are to be lit up throughout.
2. Dutch Passenger Paddle Steamers:(a) One steamer may run on each weekday between Flushing andSouthwold and vice vend.  The ships must be paddle steamers.(b) The ships must make the North Hinder Lightship and must pass through the- barred area by day on both the outward and home-ward journey.(c) Markings of ships as prescribed for the American vessels, exceptthat the Dutch ensign takes the place of the American.II. In doubtful cases, passenger ships mentioned in (1) and (2) may be held up in order to ascertain their identity and their right to run to and from England and to bear the markings. The route prescribed for ships mentioned in (1) and (2) may not be sown with mines.ADMIRAL.E. d. H. E. B. 3466.F. d. JT.

The patrol vessels in the Sound are receiving orders not to issue any more safe-conducts after the evening of 31 January to harbours within the barred area. In other respects, the Timber Agreement will not be annulled, in order that Sweden may not open the Kogrund Passage/(c) Ships oarrying food-stuffs of Danish origin are to be allowed to pass, if they have sailed before the evening of 1 February. The promise given to Denmark to allow food-stuffs of Danish origin to go through to England will be rescinded on 1 February.; (d) Our Consuls in Spain will receive directions on 1 February not to issue any more safe-conducts for fruit ships.

Leader or Submarines. 27.1 i7.Gg.B. No. 100/0.MOST SECRET!Written by an Officer. Control No. 20.WRITTEN RECORD OF THE CONFERENCE WITH CAPTAINS OF SUBMARINES ON 17.1.1917(with some additional remarks).A. General.By order of His Majesty the Emperor, the unrestricted Submarine War-fare war on commerce will begin on 1.2.1917. This form of warfare is to force England to make peace and thereby to decide the whole war. Energetic action is required, but above all rapidity of action.The submarine war is therefore to be prosecuted with the utmost vigour. No vessel must remain afloat, the sinking of which is authorized. Orders must be carried out with exactitude, doubts must be cleared up before going to se*a.Such consideration has hitherto been shown to submarine crews, that now the greatest efforts are to be expected from them. Leave is only possible when repairs to the boat are not affected by it. For this reason, food allowances of submarines are increased. The sole aim is, that each boat shall fire her entire supply of ammunition as often as possible. The standard of achievement is not each separate enterprise, but the total result over any given period.Therefore short cruises, short visits to the dockyard, considerable curtail-ment of practices. If a submarine is at sea for 14 days in each month and fires her full supply of torpedoes and a corresponding amount of gun ammunition, that constitutes the best form of practice. During periods of overhaul, only what is absolutely necessary is to be done. The crew and reserve personnel are to be made the utmost use of.Venereal diseases represent an avoidable loss from a military standpoint  often a very serious loss-which must be eliminated in the future.   Crews are to be instructed by their Captains as to this military point of view, in addition to instruction from the doctors.    In addition, special orders&apos; regarding the suppression of venereal diseases are being issued.Care is to be exercised when manoeuvring with submarines. Damage in harbour must be absolutely avoided.B. Execution of Orders.   -Orders: Admiralty Staff, A 1119 0 I of 12.1.17; A 1580 0 I of 18.1.17; A 1993 O I of 26.1.17.Limits of stations in accordance with Leader of Submarines Gg. 53/0 of 17.1.17*Our object is to cut England off from traffic by sea, and not to achieve occasional results at far-distant points. As far as possible, therefore, stations must be taken up near the English coast, where routes converge and where divergence becomes. impossible. When the weather is so bad that weapons cannot be used, better weather conditions and chance successes are not to be sought at far-distant points at sea, but the boat is to remain on her station, if necessary submerging to avoid damage. An improvement in the weather will then be perceived immediately and can at once be utilized without any delay in reaching the spot.C. Procedure.Principal advantages of the ruthless submarine warfare:(1) Attack submerged on all ships which are armed or suspect, whenever the boat is in a position for attacking submerged or by means of her speedcan reach such a position. (2) Utilization of all chances of attack by night.*P.4.-Tr.
(3) Immediately effective firing when a ship is stopped by gunfire, with-out time being wasted on warning shots.(4) No boat communication; consequently, when holding up a ship, the position of the submarine and her distance from the enemy can be chosen solely from the military standpoint. On principle, way should always be kept on the boat to render an attack more difficult, particularly that of an enemy submarine, and in order that the boat herself may remain com-pletely under control, so as to avoid a torpedo, if necessary.When a ship, abandoned by her crew, is to be sunk by gunfire, she should be approached from aft; she is then not in a position either to ram or to open fire, as the submarine traps with hidden armament, reported to date, in every case had their guns on the broadside. A trap will endeavour without exciting notice to keep beam on to the submarine and will turn accordingly. Look out for this ! When approaching keep one bow torpedo ready for firing, with the tube flooded, and keep the enemy under fire; have the boat ready for diving and no men on deck except those actually required. As a rule, expend only one torpedo on each ship stopped. If a ship allows herself to be torpedoed, she will either be no trap or she will then have ceased to be dangerous. Consequently she should be finished off with gunfire, if possible.A sharp lookout must be kept for the approach of any further vessels, particularly any which may lie hidden under the lee of the ship attacked. An approach from astern permits of observation on both sides.The possibility is to be taken into account that neutral vessels also may be armed.D. The passage through the English Channel.All boats are to proceed through the English Channel; exceptions to this order may be made in isolated cases. The objects of proceeding through the Channel are:(1) To shorten the cruise, so that each boat may make as many cruises as possible in a given period of time.(2) To shorten the period spent in the dockyard correspondingly with the shortening of the cruise, particularly as the heavy strain on the boat ir. the northern part of the North Sea and in the Atlantic is avoided.(3) In cases where bad weather is met with in the area of operations, to allow the boats time to await an improvement, instead of their being obliged after a short while to start on the long homeward voyage round the Shetlands without having attained any result, as has frequently happened.The navigation, when coming from the West, is simple; from the East-ward, proceed via North Hinder Lightship,-Buoy 2501,* and the Light Buoys in the Straits of Dover (further details in the Appendix to &quot; Sub-marine Daily Orders &quot;).The French lights are burning with their peace characteristics, though frequently with diminished power. These conditions may change, con-sequently navigation must be mainly by compass, watch, and tidal stream chart. The correct position of the navigational marks must be checked on each cruise. Proceed in the deepest channel. It is possible that remains of the former net may still be left; it is best to pass these on the surface; if forced to dive, go down to 40 metres [131 ft.] in order to pass under any remains of the net. As far as possible, pass through the area between the Hoofden and Cherbourg without being observed and without stopping; on the other hand, the boats, which in exceptional cases pass round Scotland, are to let themselves be seen as freely as possible in order to mislead the English. Pass through Dover Straits at night, when possible with the tidal stream. Bad weather provides the most favourable conditions, as the patrols then keep a very poor lookout, and submarine chasers (motor boats) are then innocuous. Look out for large unlit buoys - Only in the case of being unable to keep the sea is it permitted to enter a Flemish port, particularly as, owing to mines and nets, the approach is dangerous without a pilot.* Position apparently about 610 21&apos; N., 20 6&apos; E.-Tr.
* Hydrophones are meant.-Tr.A wireless signal from Bruges every night will give information regard-ing changes in conditions in the Channel. If there is nothing to report, the signal &quot; Nothing new &quot; will be made. Boats should arrange their supplies of oil fuel in such a way that, in case of a sudden blocking of the Channel, they could at any time proceed round Scotland.E. Counter measures to be expected.(a) Nets and Mines: Measures on a large scale against the German Bight may be expected.The German Bight and .the &quot; Way &quot; as far as the Northern part of the Hoofden are kept constantly under observation by airships, the Southern part of the Hoofden by aircraft from Flanders. The Fleet will use all its resources to keep a way to the Northward and a way to the Westward clear of mines. In addition, the boats will be escorted by barrage-breakers, outpost boats, S-Group, and aircraft. Where danger from mines is suspected, it is advisable to proceed at a depth of 20-30 metres [65-98 ft.]. The jumping wires must be constantly examined. British mines are frequently near the surface; as a rule they do not detonate, particularly with such short vessels as submarines, as the lever arrangement does not then come into action. Netted areas should be crossed on the surface. If forced to dive by patrols, go as deep as possible.The defence of Emdeh against air attack will be improved.(b) Submarine traps.These are vessels with concealed guns. Up to the present the guns have always been mounted on the broadside, mostly about in the middle of the ship&apos;s length. These vessels use neutral flags and often neutral markings alsp frequently on reversible boards. They often proceed in the near neighbourhood of a neutral ship, in order to approach the submarine whilst the latter is occupied with the neutral. When held up, they stop, blow off steam, in some cases even simulate hits and a fire on board, and abandon the ship in boats, leaving the guns&apos; crews on board. Frequently the fire is returned with a gun of small calibre in order to make the submarine confident and entice her nearer, when the heavier guns will open fire. Every ship must be held suspect, even sailing ships. But up to date, no sailing ships have been identified as submarine traps.Ships, when stopped, should be approached from astern (see &quot; C,&quot; p. 10). Internal fuzed shells from astern will penetrate the sides of the big after compartments (engine-room or holds). For the case of ships which work together with submarines, always keep way on the boat (see &quot; C,&quot; p. 10). The quicker the submarine sinks the ship and leaves the spot, the less time the enemy submarine has for an attack. Ships have recently been observed together with aircraft. It is uncertain as yet whether the ship guides the aircraft to the attack, or whether the aircraft leads the ship to the position of the submarine. Aircraft seen at sea are in any case a sign that submarine traps may be in the neighbourhood.Submarine chasers large, very fast motor boats from a. distance look like a submarine or a buoy; they endeavour to ram submarines. It has been observed that submarine chasers take up the position of light buoys (in the Channel) and imitate their markings, in order to ram any sub-marine which may pass.   They cannot be employed in a seaway.(c) Submarine Telegraphy. *British searching formations make considerable use of submarine tele-graphy,* by means of which they also keep touch. They are able to hear the sounds of propellers and possibly also auxiliary machinery, periscope motor, trimming pump, ballast pump, ,&amp;c. Where it is suspected that submarine telegraphy is being used, dive to a great depth also in view of the possibility of towed nets stop all auxiliary machinery, and proceed with one engine as slowly as possible; if practicable, stop occasionally and make big alterations of course. Keep a watch on the movements of the enemy by means of your own submarine telegraphy installation.
* Lieutenant-Commander Schulthess, after being a prisoner in England from 20 July, 1915, when &quot; TJ. 23 &quot; was sunk, until 4 December, 1916, was transferred to Switzerland; it was there, no doubt, that he made the above-mentioned report. His impression as to the accuracy of our information regarding German submarines was presumably derived either from conversation with British officers after his capture, or from comparing notes with other German submarine officers who were fellow prisoners of his in England.-Tr.F. Prize Steamers.The taking of prize steamers for the reception of ships&apos; crews will in future be unnecessary. This procedure must cease entirely, as close to the English coast, where submarines are now to operate, it is not really practicable and would entail unnecessary loss of time, which must be avoided. Prize crews will not be provided in the future. It is desired that prizes from the North Sea should be brought in. They are not to be brought from the West ooast.Gr. Procedure in regard to other Submarines.We must now take into account the possibility of meeting enemy sub-marines anywhere, even on the West coast. Consequently no notice should, as a rule, be taken of submarines sighted; as far as possible, avoid being seen by them. Even if the other boat is definitely recognized as an enemy, and an attack would meet with success, the result would be less valuable for the war against commerce than if the same torpedo had sunk a large merchant vessel.In cases where a submarine is definitely recognized as one of our own, intelligence may be exchanged, mutual arrangements made, &amp;c.H. Identification of the Vessels sunk.Where it is feasible without disadvantage, the name and cargo of the ship are to be ascertained, and as far as practicable, the papers are to be secured. If this is not possible, the size of the vessel is to be estimated. The Captain and Engineers are, when practicable, to be taken prisoners. But in no case may the submarine be endangered owing to oommunicating with the ship&apos;s boats.I.Although details of the orders issued must not at present be made known to the crews of submarines, nevertheless the decisive importance of the impending phase of the war is to be clearly impressed upon the crews.K.Intelligence received from England, e.g., the report of the Captain of &quot; TJ. 23,&quot;* proves that the British are kept continuously and most accurately informed regarding our submarines and their movements. The greatest reticence is therefore demanded, particularly in public places, in trains, &amp;c, in regard to all matters concerning submarines, their numbers, and method of construction, their orders and the manner of carrying them out, their routes, &amp;c. The crews are to be instructed repeatedly and explicitly on this matter, with the caution that through carelessness in conversation they may become answerable for the destruction of their own submarine.(signed)    BAUER.
Chief of the Admiralty Staff.B.3386. * . Bebhn,11 February 1916.SECRET 1*   -ORDER FOR PROCEDURE AGAINST ARMED ENEMY MERCHANTVESSELS.I. Enemy merchant ships which are armed with guns are to be con-sidered as war vessels and to be destroyed by every means available.Commanding Officers must bear in mind that mistakes in identity will lead to a rupture with neutral Powers, and that the destruction of a merchant vessel on account of her being armed may only be proceeded with when the armament has actually been observed.In view of the warning to Neutrals, conveyed through diplomatic channels, this Order does not come into force until 29 February.II. The provisions of paragraph 1 of the Appendix to the Prize Regula-tions of 22 June 1914 are not affected by the above Order.*By Order of His Majesty. (signed)    v. HOLTZENDORFF.* The paragraph in question reads as follows:&quot; The exercise of the right of visit, search and capture, as well as every attack on the part of an armed merchant ship upon a German or neutral merchant ship, is considered an act of piracy. The crew is to be proceeded against in accordance with the&apos;regulations as to extraordinary martial law procedure.&quot;The German official view is therefore now that a defensively armed enemy merchant ship when attacked by a German submarine has the status of a man-of-war; at other times she is, at best, merely a merchant ship, and, at worst, a piratel-Tr.

SECOND INTERIM REPORT. ,To the Right Hon. Sir Gordon Hewaet, K.C., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Attorney-General.Sir,Since the presentation of the First Interim Report to the Right Hon. Sir Frederick E. Smith, K.C., M.P., then His Majesty&apos;s Attorney-General, on 13th January, 1919, the. Com-mittee have held four meetings,- and have received and considered the Second Interim. Reports of the Sub-Committees for Offences on Land, at Sea and in the Air, and the Report of the Special Sub-Committee on Aerial Law.The recommendations contained in the Second Interim Report of the Sub-Committee for Offences on Land were subject to certain amendments relating&apos; to the case of Captain . Fryatt, adopted by your Committee on 6th May, 1919.*The Committee also came tp the conclusion that there were not at present sufficient materials for founding any specific charge based on the use of liquid fire.The Second Interim Report of the Sub-Committee for Offences at Sea consists of the following four distinct parts: -The. recommendations contained in the first part, which dealt with bombardments of the British Coast Towns and places by the Naval Forces of Germany, were adopted by., your Committee oh 11th February, 1919. tThe recommendations contained in the second part, which dealt with the use of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines by Germany, were adopted by vour Committee on 6th May, I 1919.1 &apos;  -      . ,.The third part, dealing with the Responsibility of the German   Imperial   Chancellor   for   Submarine   Warfare &apos; against Commerce, was amended and adopted by your Com-mittee on 6th May, 1919.$   Tour Committee were not pre-- pared in the circumstances to advise that the name of Herr von Bethmann Hollweg should be included among those whose surrender should be demanded, but they submitted the facts of the case for the consideration of the Law Officers.The fourth part, dealing with the. Detention of British,. Merchant Seamen by Germany, was adopted as amended-by- your Committee on 6th May, 1919. Your Committee recom-mend in respect of this Report that no action be&apos;taken, in as much as they, consider the evidence insufficient to substan-. tiate a charge of any breach of international law or of the laws and customs of war by the German authorities in respect of the detention complaineH of.11* See p. 162. f See p. 311. t See p. 316.1 ,       5 See p. 322.

The Second Interim Eeport of the Sub-Committee for Offences in the Air contains three parts.The recommendations contained in Part I, dealing with Airship Raids over Great Britain, were adopted by your Committee on llth February, 1919.*Part III, dealing with the Aeroplane Raid on Etaples of 31st May-lst June, 1918, was referred back to the Sub-Com-mittee lor further investigation. It was again presented with additional evidence to your Committee on 6th May, 1919. Your Committee were of opinion that no proceedings ought to be taken in respect of such raid.tPart II, dealing with certain typical Aeroplane Raids over Great Britain during the years 1917 and 1918, was presented to your Committee on 6th May, 1919. By a majority of seven votes to one, your Committee resolved that such raids amounted to an indiscriminate bombing of the Metropolitan Area of London.tThe question of the legality of such raids was considered by your Committee on 22nd May, 1919. Upon the presentation of a Memorandum on The Law of Aerial Warfare by Mr. Herbert F. Manisty and a reply thereto by Colonel Wynn (appended&quot; here-with), it was resolved that a Special Sub-Committee consisting of Mr. Justice Peterson (Chairman), Mr. Manisty, Sir Alfred Hopkinson, Sir Archibald Bodkin and Colonel Wynn, be appointed to consider the question of the legality of indis-criminate bombing, and to report generally.This Special Sub-Committee, which met on 27th May, 1919, unanimously reported as follows:  &quot; (1) That the bombardment from aircraft of the civilian population of London, without attempting to confine the attack to establishments, works and material of military importance, was a breach of the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity.&quot; (2) That it is in our opinion no defence to a charge of a breach of the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity by bombardment of London from the air, that the object was to destroy or terrorise the civilian population.&quot;At their meeting on 3rd June, 1919, your Committee unani-mously adopted the Report of the Special Subcommittee con-taining these conclusions, and they further resolved that the principles upon which these were based applied to the Airship Raids over Great Britain referred to in Part I of the Second Interim Report of the Sub-Committee for Offences in the Air.Tour Committee desire to add that since the presentation on the 6th May, 1919, of the Report of the Sub-Committee for Offences on Land, this Sub-Committee have been engaged upon* See p. 326.t See p. 344.% See p. 328.
the examination of evidence relating to offences against prisoners of war in Germany and Bulgaria. The results of this examina-tion will be included in the Third Interim Report of the Sub-Committee, to be presented shortly to the Committee.The Law Officers having expressed a desire for a report upon the circumstances attending the arrest and detention of Napoleon in 1815, the Chairman entrusted the investigation to Mr. H. Hale Bellot, whose Memorandum will be found in the Appendix to our Report. *Signed on behalf of the Committee,JOHN MAODONELL,Chairman.J. H. MORGAN,Vice-Chairman.Hugh H. L. Bellot,J. E. G. de Montmorency, Secretaries.3rd June, 1919.MEMORANDUM No. 1. The Law of Aerial Warfare. By Herbert F. Manisty, K.C.Although no great progress in the offensive use of aircraft in war had been made prior to the First Hague Conference, plans were known to exist for dropping projectiles and explosives from aircraft. In his circular letter of January 11th, 1899, Count Mouravieff proposed &quot;the prohibition of the discharge of pro-jectiles or explosives of any kind from balloons or any similar means.&quot;By Declaration I. of the Hague Conference, 1899, the con-tracting Powers agreed &apos;&apos;&apos; to prohibit for a term of five years the discharge of projectiles and explosives from balloons or by other new methods of a similar nature.&quot; This declaration was ratified by Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and by Russia, France, Japan-, Italy and Greece amongst others, but not by the United States, Great Britain and some of the minor Powers. The idea guiding the majority in favour of the pro-hibition was that, in the then undeveloped stage of the new weapon, injury or destruction might be caused to neutrals or non-combatants which would be of no practical military advantage.The&apos; Declaration having expired, it was renewed by Declaration. I. of the Second Hague Conference, with the* See p. 361.
substitution of the words &quot;for a period extending to the close of the Third Peace Conference&quot; for the previous &quot;term of five years.&quot;Ratified by twenty-seven nations, amongst whom figured Great Britain, the&quot; United States, Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey, the Convention was rejected by seventeen, including Germany, Italy, Japan, Prance and Russia.The motives for this volte-face are probably not far to seek. Great Britain was accused by German writers of awakening to the fact that her insular security was now imperilled. Russia was said to be influenced by the loss of her navy in the Japanese War, and Germany by the result of her progress in the develop-ment of dirigible craft.It is interesting to note that as a rider to the prohibition of aerial bombardment the following resolution was carried in the Sub-Committee by thirty-one votes to one, with three abstentions, viz.: &quot; The bombardment by military balloons is subject to the same restrictions accepted for land and sea warfare in so far as this is compatible with the new method of fighting.&quot;From the discussions in the Sub-Committee it is clear that members considered that aerial bombardment was governed by the same general rules as land or naval bombardment.Although the direct prohibition had thus failed to obtain general consent the main object was obtained indirectly. By Article 25 of Convention IY. (The Laws and Customs of War on Land), &quot;The attack or bombardment by any means whatever  par quelque moyen que se soit of towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefended is prohibited.&quot; The phrase &quot;by any means whatever&quot; was understood at the time to cover the case of bombardment of undefended places by projectiles or explosives from balloons or other aircraft, as well as by bombard-ment by land or maritime forces. By some writers it was subse-quently denied that it applied to aerial warfare at all. By others, who admitted its application, it was argued that places in which war materials were stored were not undefended. In determining what constituted an undefended coast town, the delegates to the Second Conference came to the conclusion that, owing to the special character of naval warfare, the presence of military works, military or naval establishments, depots of arms or war material, workshops or plant which can be utilised for the needs of the enemy fleet or army, and vessels of war in the port, renders the town liable to bombardment.&quot; War material &quot; was understood to cover &quot; coal depots,&quot; but the contention of the German delegate, Admiral Siegel, that &quot; installations propres a etre uttlisSs pour les besoins de la flotte ou de Varmee ennemis &quot; covered important railway junctions in proximity to an undefended port, public or private warehouses and magazines, and railway stations, was uot accepted by the Conference. If such contentions, said M. Yan den Heuvel, were accepted it would be permissible to bombard all the maritime-parts of the town.
The following definitions were officially adopted :-*&quot; What is a defended town? In war on land there is no difficulty. An armed force is approaching a town. It may be fortified or open. Even if it is usually open the entrance may be defended by temporary banks, barricades, or other earthworks. It goes without saying that the attacking force has a perfect right to bring its artillery to bear on such defences, and in such manner as it may think effective in order to obtain possession of the town. Nevertheless, it will concentrate its artillery against these defence works and against the enemy artillery and forces, but it will take care not to direct its shells en pure perte against the town itself, seeing that they might result in loss to the civil population. In so doing the true soldier respects the honourable traditions of his profession.&quot; In maritime warfare the circumstances are less simple. Suppose that an enemy tried to land on the Dutch coast, for instance at Scheveningen, which is practically a suburb of The Hague, Dutch forces could be sent to oppose the enemy&apos;s landing. Would this defence justify the bombard-ing of The Hague, which is an undefended city? Assuredly not. Such defence would not constitute The Hague a defended city. In these conditions to bombard it would be contrary to the law of nations because it would be unneces-sary cruelty. It would be worse than unnecessary. The destruction of the habitations of peaceful citizens, the setting fire to its public buildings, would not only not help to over-come the forces which would have to be defeated in order . to obtain a landing, but it would stimulate their ardour in fighting against such unmitigated barbarism. In short, a &apos; defended town &apos; means, and means only, a town which is itself directly defended.&quot;tCoastal warfare formed the subject of much controversy in the eighties. Admiral Aube prophesied that naval forces would destroy coast towns or, at the very least, hold them mercilessly at ransom. Professor Holland contended that such proceedings would be contrary to International law, and that bombardment of an undefended port should only be permitted, if requisitions in kind necessary for the enemy fleet were refused, by way of reprisals, or in case a landing were opposed by armed forces.In the rules formulated by the Institute of International Law, the principle was adopted that bombardment of undefended towns should be prohibited. This principle was followed in the United States Naval War Code, 1900, which provided&apos; that &quot; the bombardment by a naval force of unfortified and undefended towns, villages or buildings is forbidden, except when such bombardment is incidental to the destruction of military or naval* In the Protocol to the Convention, it is stated that the articles in the Con-vention: relating to an undefended town were based upon thefdefinitions given to the Suh-Conunittee by General von Boer Portugael,  See Parl. Papers Misc. No.l, 1908, Cd, 4081,114^5. f toeuxifoe Conf. Inter. T. Ill, 546,
establishments, public depots of munitions of war, or vessels of war in port, or unless reasonable requisitions for provisions and supplies essential ait the same time to such naval vessel or vessels&apos; are forcibly withheld, in which case due notice of bombardment shall be given.&quot;The British Manual of Military Law (1914), 252-3, declares that it is not a sufficient reason for bombardment that a town contains supplies of value to the enemy or railway establish-ments, telegraphs or bridges. If necessary, they must be destroyed otherwise. The defended locality need not be forti-fied; it may be deemed defended if a military force is in occu-pation or marching through it. A fortress or fortified place is primd facie deemed defended, and can be bombarded, unless there are visible signs of surrender.Obviously the analogy between aerial bombardment and mili-tary and naval bombardment is not complete. The object of military bombardment, or the threat of bombardment, as we have seen, is to requisition supplies, to compel evacuation of the armed forces, to obtain possession of a strategic point, and even the destruction of the town by way of reprisals. The object of a naval bombardment is very similar. In both cases notice must first be given to enable the enemy to comply with the demand.None of these objects can be obtained by aerial hombard-ment. Notice is almost impossible, since surprise is essential io a successfTil attack. Requisition is impossible. Indiscriminate destruction of non-combatants and private property is almost inevitable, and this is usually accompanied by an absence of any direct military objective. In endeavouring to place aerial war-fare upon the same plane as land and naval, the majority of The Hague delegates, and also juristic writers and publicists, were prompted by the motive of restricting aerial warfare to purely military objectives. Their primary object was to protect non-combatants and private property not directly involved in military operations. The principle was thus stated by the Institute of International Law at Madrid in 1911: &quot; Aerial warfare must not comprise greater danger to the person and the property of the peaceful population than land or sea warfare.&quot;This goes to the root of aerial warfare. If the &quot; nation in arms&quot; theory is to be accepted the distinction between com-batants and non-combatants painfully involved in the-course of the last three centuries must be abandoned.It is said that since the Hague Conventions 1907 are not operative since all the belligerents have not ratified them, no law of aerial warfare exists. Assuming the Convention to be inoperative, nevertheless it is clear that new methods and new weapons of warfare fall within the common law of war. It was contended by the German authorities that because the submarine could not, without the risk of destruction, approach a merchant-man for the purpose of visit and search, it was therefore entitled. to sink at sight.   Similarly it is now contended that because
an aeroplane cannot with safety to itself bomb a military objec-tive from such a low altitude as will ensure success, it is there-fore entitled to bomb from such a height as renders accurate shooting impossible. Good shooting under such conditions has been defined as one hit in three hundred. That is to say, out of every three hundred bombs aimed at a military objective, two hundred and ninety-nine fall on non-military objectives.Just as the submarine commander may not dispense with the established laws and customs of war relating to visit of merchant-men and the safety of the crews and passengers, so the com-mander of an aeroplane must conform to the general rules established in the case of bombardment of undefended towns, and if he cannot attain his military objective without causing damage far beyond the legitimate object of attack he must either expose himself to the additional risk entailed or abstain from an attack.It is clear law that the use of weapons of warfare which cannot be used without breaking the existing law must not be used at all until the law is altered.That military objectives can be bombed from the air success-fully without damage to adjoining non-military areas has. been demonstrated by our own airmen. The contention, therefore, that indiscriminate bombing under the existing common law of war is legal, because accurate bombing cannot be attained with safety, cannot be sustained. Upon the analogy of the rules of military and naval bombardment it is clear that aerial bombard-ment of non-military objectives either deliberately or recklessly is illegal.MEMORANDUM No. 2.Reply to Mb. H. F. Manisty&apos;s Paper on the Law of AerialWarfare.By Lt.-Colonel A. H, W. E. Wynn, O.B.E.It is admitted in the fifth paragraph, page 156, that whether Article 25 of Convention IV. (The Laws and Customs of War on Land) is applicable to aerial warfare is a matter of doubt. It is admitted that it is considered by some that places in which war materials are stored are not undefended, and are, consequently, liable to bombardment. In the same paragraph, it is stated that the delegates to the second conference came to the conclusion that, owing to the special character of naval warfare, the pre-sence of military works, establishments, &amp;c, renders the town liable to bombardment. This is an admission that the previous Conventions visualized a particular type of warfare, and that in principle the application of these Conventions is capable of modi-fication in accordance with the circumstances of warfare of a special character.Warfare in general, and aerial warfare in particular, as we know to-day is different to warfare as visualized when the Con-ventions were drafted.   The type of warfare then visualized is
shown in the portion within inverted commas on page 157. This was written with no knowledge of the nature of modern war. Every house in a town is a potential machine gun emplacement. Even field guns can he located on the ground floor of houses. Every building affording a good view is a potential observation post. - &apos; &apos;Can it be maintained that a building suspected of being put to such uses should be regarded as in any Way immune, even though innocent habitations might suffer?The American delegation oh the Crimes Commission at the Peace Conference, drew up a memorandum&apos;on the principles which should determine inhuman and improper acts of war. This memorandum states that &quot; the test of guilt in the perpetra-tion of an act which would be inhuman or otherwise reprehen-sible under normal conditions is the necessity of that act to the protection of national safety or national rights measured chiefly by actual military advantage.&quot;This principle is in accordance with the &quot; United States Naval War Code,&quot; as quoted at the bottom of page 157, and is the only one applicable to modern war and the only basis upon which we can determine the legality or illegality of acts of war.It is not sought to establish a complete analogy between aerial bombardment and naval or military bombardment, but it may be asked, could it have been legitimate to bombard London from the sea if the Germans could have brought ships off the mouth of the Thames and if these ships could have carried guns of sufficient range to reach the city?According to the foregoing principles and to Article 2 of the Convention Respecting Bombardments by Naval Forces in time of War (M.M.N., page 353), such action would have been legiti-mate, as it cannot be denied that in London were military works, establishments, depots, workshops, &amp;c.If it is legitimate to project a bomb on to a town from a &quot;gun by means of a propellant, why should it be illegal to carry a bomb over a target and there let it drop ?With regard to the question of notice of bombardment, this need only be given if it is practicable to do so.The objects of a bombardment are not restricted to those given in the second paragraph of page 158 of the paper.Article 2 of the Convention referred to above specifically states that the destruction of naval and military depots and of plant which could be utilized for the needs of the hostile fleet or army by artillery fire is allowed. There was no absence of a direct military objective in London, nor is long-range bombard-ment necessarily more accurate than aerial bombardment, and the innocent are likely to suffer as much from one as from the other.The opening lines of the concluding paragraph are not in accordance1 wi^h facts. Our own airmen, as photographs show, constantly dropped bombs unintentionally on non-military areas,
Repoet of Special Sub-Committee on Aerial Law.Tour Special Sub-Committee, consisting of the Hon. Mr. Justice Peterson (Chairman), Mr. Herbert P. Manisty, K.C., Sir Alfred Hopkinson, K.C., Sir Archibald Bodkin and Lt.-Col. Wynn, were appointed on 13th May, 1919, to consider and determine the legality or illegality of indiscriminate bombardment of London from air and to report to the Committee.Tour Special Sub-committee met on 27th May, 1919, and after consideration of the question submitted to them unanimously came to the following conclusions, viz.:  (1) That the bombardment from aircraft of the civilian population of London without attempting to confine the attack to establishments, works and material of military importance was a breach of the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity.(2) That it is in our opinion no defence to a charge of a breach of the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity by bombardment of London from the air that the object was to destroy or terrorise the civilian population.Tour Special Sub-Committee also considered that it may be advisable to ascertain from the Allied and Associated Govern-ments whether they concur in these opinions and whether, apart from reprisals, their practice has been consistent with such opinions.Signed on behalf of the Special Sub-Committee,A. P. PETERSON,ChairmanHUGH H. L. BELLOT, Secretary.27th May, 1919.although it is not worth the while of any belligerents to risk his men and his machines in attacking anything that has no military value.If we make this a war crime we place a noose round the necks of our airmen.There can be no question that the aerial bombardment of non-military objectives is illegal. But can London be regarded as other than a military objective?
SECOND INTERIM REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE FOR OFFENCES ON LAND.Yo.ur Sub-Committee issued on December 17th, 1918, a first Interim Report. Since that Report they have held sixteen meet-ings and now present a Second Interim Report. The Sub-Committee arranged early in January, 1919, for the examination at Committee Room No. 1, Houses of Parliament, of the state-inents, some 170,000 in number, of repatriated prisoners of war. For this purpose a staff, under Mr. E. A. Armstrong, Barrister-at-Law, was appointed by the Main Committee on February 11th, 1919.This Staff has made satisfactory progress in the task of sorting, examining, cross-indexing and filing these statements and in preparing dossiers of special cases. On March 5th, 1919, Mr. Armstrong reported to this Sub-Committee that about 130,000 statements by repatriated prisoners of war (including statements already considered by the Government Committee on the treat-inent of British prisoners of war) had been dealt with and that 1,60Q documents had been classified and filed. Mr. Armstrong reported that the work of his staff might be completed early in May, 1919. The Sub-Committee approved of the progress which had been made.Your Sub-Committee, since their first Interim Report, have considered:  1. The method of dealing with the evidence of repatriated prisoners.2. The management of German working camps.3. The conditions at Ruhleben and other civilian internment camps.4. The treatment of prisoners of war by the British Govern-ment.5. The treatment of British merchant seamen prisoners of war by the German authorities.6, The use of poison gas by.the enemy.7. The use of liquid fire by the enemy.8. The stealing by the enemy of food, parcels and kit belong-ing to British prisoners of war.9. Special Cases:-i. The case of Miss Edith Cavell.ii. The case of Captain Charles Fryatt.iii. The shooting incident at Langensalza Camp.iv. The   case  of   Lieutenant-Commander  CharlesHenry Cowley, V;C., R.N.V.R.

where they were inspected by Khalil Pasha, who appears to have told General Townshend that he had recommended the Turkish War Office to exchange the Rut prisoners on parole in view of the difficulties of the proposed march through Mesopotamia, but that the Turkish War Office, of which Enver Pasha was the head, refused. Enver Pasha at this time was at Baghdad. Khalil Pasha assured General Townshend that, in view of the heroic defence of Kut during a period of five months, he and his troops would have the same reception in Turkey as Osman Pasha, the hero of Plevna, had in Russia. At Baghdad he further assured General Townshend that he and his officers and men would have every possible care taken of them, and that they would be placed in healthy localities in Asia Minor. In fact, the march of the British troops from Kut-el-Amara through Baghdad and North by way of Samara, Tekrit, Kalat Shergat and Mosul, and thence North-West and West across the Desert by way of Nisibin to the rail head at Ras-al-Ain was attended by every aggravation of neglect and brutality. The route is indi-cated on the map subjoined to this Report. The prisoners were compelled to march, however sick they might, be. All the prisoners in fact had been greatly enfeebled by the privations of the siege. They were driven on with whips and blows until they dropped on the route, and then they were left to die without any attention of any kind, medical or otherwise. The rations provided were of the scantiest description. The advanced escort had bought up all available provisions, which were retailed to the prisoners at greatly enhanced prices. Tne prisoners had to barter their clothes and boots for food, while their kit was stolen or taken by force. The prime necessity of water in ai Mesopotamian summer was very scarce, and while in reach of the Tigris the prisoners were prevented from obtaining water from the river even for those who had fallen out from exhaustion. This terrible forced march of 500 miles, which began on May 6th, 1916, and lasted until July, 1916, resulted in many deaths and an incalcu-lable amount of suffering. Enver Pasha, his staff and a number of German officers overtook one of the various parties of the men between Tekrit and Kalat Shergat, and on complaint being made to him he reprimanded an officer of the Turkish, escort, probably by way of preserving some reputation with the German officers,&apos; who, as a general rule, seem to have been appalled by the treat ment of the prisoners by the Turks. General Sir Charles Melliss, who travelled along the same route as the prisoners, telegraphed to Khalil Pasha that something must be done to alleviate their lot, and when he reached the neighbourhood of Constantinople he urged on Enver Pasha the need of immediate action; but Enver Pasha declared that he did not believe his account. Enver Pasha, however, had seen the state of things himself, and had reprimanded an officer of the Turkish escort. Nothing, how-ever, was done. Enver Pasha, as the head of the Turkish War Office, is directly as well as technically responsible, since he was on the spot at the critical period and had his attention called to the barbarous conditions of the march and yet did nothing to save the victims. When the working camps were reached by the survivors of the march, who were in fact unfit for any sort
hi labour, the conditions of living and work were found to vary fpeatly.   Some were tolerable, others were atrocious.   Many of phe prisoners were set to work on the extension of the Baghdad J Railway to Mosul.    This railway was being constructed by iSerman contractors, and the prisoners were handed over to the Icon tractors&apos; engineers.   In (the case of the railway extension fiom lAngora the work was done by the Turkish War Office without Ithe intervention of contractors, and the War Office was directly Iresponsible for the conditions.   The lot of the prisoners in many leases was pitiable; irregularity of rations, insufficient clothing, insufficient tent accommodation so that prisoners had to lie out fin all weathers; compulsory work even when suffering from I serious illnesses, brutal treatment, in many cases inadequate I medical attendance and supplies, so that when an epidemic of i typhus broke out they died like flies.   In many cases their rations were cut off when they were too ill to work.   In some cases the accommodation was deplorable.   Kemal Bey appears to have been in charge of the Prisoners of War Department and to have acted as intermediary between the War Office and the Camp j Commander.   Requests by the American Embassy and the Dutch I Legation to the Turkish Foreign Office for the betterment of the i Camps, the transmission of food, clothing and parcels, the I better treatment of prisoners in hospitals, were completely I ignored though the railway was in use for the transmission of Turkish mercantile goods.   The evidence seems to show that the I War Office having promised good conditions left the prisoners I exposed to the most shocking hardships and barbarities, and I deliberately declined or neglected to improve their lot and pre-1 vented others from doing so.   The treatment of prisoners at the Afion-Kara-Hissar Camp under Muzloum Bey and Suleiman Bey was peculiarly brutal.   The treatment of prisoners of war in the group of working camps in the district of Angora was also extremely bad, and the same evil conditions existed, at Mosul, Bagtcbe, and in the large majority of the camps, prisons and hospitals dealt with in the latter part of this memorandum.   In the rare cases where comparatively good treatment was accorded to the prisoners of war the fact is duly indicated.   The situation of these various camps is indicated in the map subjoined to this Report.The Sub-Committee recommend that Enver Pasha be tried on the charges set out in Memorandum I., and that Kemal Bey, the Acting Head of the Prisoners of War Department of the Turkish War Office, Von Bach Pasha, Inspector-General of the lines of communications, and Lt.-C&apos;ol. Rushdi .Bey, Chief of the Staff of the Turkish Army, be also scheduled for presecution in respect of the ill-treatment of prisoners of war. The Sub-Com-mittee further recommend that Muzloum Bey and the naval officer under Muzloum Bey (? Suleiman Bey) (in respect of the ill-treatment of prisoners at Afion-Kara-Hissar), Lt.-Col. Osman Bey, Ahmed (or Mahomet) Kilmi Bey, Nazim (or Nassim) Effendi, Lutvey (or Luthi) Bey, Takir Effendi, Mohammed Bey, Ombashi Soliman and saditin (or Saditin) Effendi (in respect of ill-treatment of prisoners of war in the Angora Working Camps), Ibrahim (or Ismail) Hakki Bey and Abdul Ghani Bey (in respect
ol the same charge at Mosul), Bimbashi Ariff Bey, Herr Olauss, Senior, and Herr Clauss, Junior (in respect of tie ill-treatment of prisoners of war in the Bagtche Working Camp), Tewfik Bey (on similar charge at Ras^el-Ain), Saleh Bey, Bedri (or Budru) Bey and Herr Niegebauer, or Niemeyer (on similar charge at Nisibin and Nisinberg), Djemal (or Jemal) Effendi and Herr Sebold (or Zeebold) at Yarbashi (or Yarabashi), Rafig Effendi, and Ibra-him Effendi (on similar charge at Telhadi), Nouri Bey (on similar charge at Dierbieza), Herr Eoelner (on similar charge at Dier-bieza) Herr Eoegel (on similar charge at Telhadi), Heir Gallus (on similar charge at Gilebek), Djevad Bey and Djemal (or Zemal) Bey (on similar charge at Seraskierat Prison, Canstanti-nople), and Suleiman Nouman Pasha and the Military Comman-dant (Summer, 1915), of the Tash Kishla Hospital, Constanti-nople, the German Municipal Engineer (October, .1916), at Ismidt, Captain Fuad (or Fouard) Staff Officer Yussuf (Adjutant 32nd Suwan Ali), and other Commanders of escorts on the marches between Kut-el-Amara and Ras-el-Ain, be scheduled for prosecution in pursuance of the charges set out in the Memor-andum.Lists of persons recommended for prosecution have been trans-mitted to Paris at the request of the Solicitor-General.Memorandum ii.The Sub-Committee have considered the case of the shooting of prisoners in Langensalza Camp on November 27th, 1918. In the confused circumstances described in the Memorandum they feel that it is impossible to indicate any person against whom proceedings can be taken in respect of this incident.Memoranda Hi and iv.The Sub-Committee have also considered the Memoranda (iv and v) dealing respectively with the use of Poison Gas and con-sider that the introduction of the former weapons was in itself a war crime; that that offence is not purged by the subsequent use of the same weapons by way of retaliation and defence on the part of Great Britain and her Allies, and that this war crime should form a count against the German Minister of War, General Hermann Yon Stein.Memorandum v.The Sub-Committee have noted the following conclusions as to the work of prisoners of war contained in Memorandum vi, which were applied by the British War Office in determining the kinds of work on which German prisoners of war might legiti-mately be employed :  1. That the work on which a prisoner of war may be em-ployed can only be judged, on the merits of each individual case;2. it is illegal to employ prisoners of war in the manufacture of munitions intended for use against their native country or its allies;
3. they may be employed on agricultural or forestry,work, ,..&apos;    as well as op work on military property, e.g.,&apos;the improvement of parade and drill grounds and of rifle ranges;4. they may be employed on preparative work, e.g., the transport of coke or of ores for the manufacture of shells, because there is no direct connection between such work and military operations;5. they can only claim exemption from such work as stands in direct relation to military operations in the area of hostilities.Memoranda vi, vii, and viii.The Sub-Committee have also noted the practice in the German working camps as to the work of prisoners including non-commis-sioned officers shown by the material contained in Memoranda vii, viii, and ix. They consider that the. compelling of R.A.M.C. men to work as ordinary prisoners of war is a war crime and should form a count against the German Minister of War, General Hermann von Stein. When the Sub-Committee proceed to deal with the evidence now becoming available as to the conditions in German working camps they will keep in view the rules by which the German Authorities regarded themselves as bound as well as the principles declaring the common laws of war laid down in the Hague Conventions.Memorandum ix.The Sub-Committee have examined the charges in a number of special cases of murder and ill-treatment on the various fronts including the cases of Miss Edith Cavell, the Reverend Mr. Mac-kenzie, Lieutenant Commander Charles Henry Cowley, Captain W. G. Morritt, and Private Thomas Rogers. It is proposed from tirjae to time to submit Special Interim Reports on these and similar cases. In the case of the execution of Captain Charles Eryatt, examined in Memorandum ix, the Sub-Committee are of opinion that the act was a deliberate murder, that Admiral von Schroeder caused this judicial murder and that he should be scheduled for prosecution. The Secretary has in a number of cases taken the evidence of select witnesses relating to various charges that are being investigated by the Sub-Committee.The Solicitor-General, Sir Ernest Pollock, attended the 17th meeting of the Sub-Committee on Wednesday, March 12th, 1919, and stated that the work of the Committee had been of immense assistance and that he and the Attorney-General had gone into the question of breaches of the laws of war at the Paris Peace Conference with an equipment that went far beyond that of the representatives of any other nation. He recommended, in view of the magnitude of the material, that in the consideration of
cases the Sub-Committee should concentrate their efforts on im-portant cases which admitted of no doubt and were capable of clear proof. He wished the Sub-Committee to continue to send him at Paris cases with the charges duly formulated and sup-ported by adequate evidence.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed)     A. P.

1. March from Kut-el-Amara.

The march from Kut-el-Amara through Bagdad and north to Mosul and thence across the desert was attended by every aggravation of neglect and brutality. The prisoners were compelled to march, however sick they might be. They were driven on with whips and blows until they dropped on the route, and then


they were left to die without any further attention of any kind, medical or otherwise. The rations provided were of the sean-tiest. It was the practice of the escort to ride on in advance and buy up the provisions, which the prisoners then had to buy from them at greatly enhanced prices. So little food was sup-plied that the prisoners had to barter their clothes and boots for food with their escort. Their kit was surreptitiously stolen by the guards or forcibly taken from them. The marches were very long, especially for men who had been enfeebled by the !?iege of Kut. Water was very scarce, but no attempt was made to provide the prisoners adequately with this prime necessity for a long march in a Mesopotamian summer. In some cases they were prevented from obtaining water from the Tigris and were even prevented from bringing water from the river to relieve the thirst of men who had fallen out in an exhausted condition. Men were forcibly and violently prevented from going to the assistance of their comrades who had fallen out. The attitude of the officers in command of the escorts is indicated by the evi-dence of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Barkat Ali, I.M.D. He saw a British soldier lying in the road and one of the escort beating him with a whip. When he went to help the sick man he was struck, and when he protested to a Turkish officer that he wanted to help the unconscious soldier, the officer directed that he should be beaten again. When men suffering from dysentery or diarrhoea fell out for the purposes of nature the escort deliberately rode them down in order to force them to rejoin the ranks, and when Barkat Ali protested to another Turkish Officer, he was abused and told that they were enemies and that he was not going to treat them decently. When he approached a staff officer named Yussuf, Adjutant of the 32nd Suwan Ali (who spoke English) he was informed that no one there cared anything for the Hague Convention.This march resulted in many deaths and an incalculable amount of suffering.Enver JPasha&apos;s Responsibility.Enver was at Bagdad when Kut-el-Amara fell. Conductor Quigley, on the march between Tekrit and Kalat Shergat, was overtaken by Enver and his staff, accompanied by a large num-ber of german officers, on the way to Mosul from Bagdad. Complaints were made to him of the treatment of the prisoners, of whom Quigley was one, and apparently Enver reprimanded the officer in charge of the escort, probably by way of preserving some reputation with the German officers, who, as a general rule, seem to have been appalled by the treatment of the prisoners by the Turks. Lance-Corpl. Thomas Bough (Royal West Kent Regt.) also states that the prisoners of war taken at Kut were inspected by Enver at Bagdad. (See also Corpl. Scott Duthie.) The Rev. Harold Spooner states that he was told by Colonel &apos; Taylor (7th Ghurka Rifles), who was one of the Kut prisoners, &apos; that he had an interview with Enver, at which Enver informed
him that he was going to grant the garrison the honours of war, and would see that they were not treated as ordinary prisoners of war, but that all possible kindness would be shown them and that they were to consider themselves his honoured guests during their stay in Turkey. (Colonel Taylor has made a statement which does not refer to this interview with Enver. He should be further questioned for particulars of this interview and its date.)According to Capt. E. H. Keeling, he was told by General Townshend (called Downton in the statement) that Khalil Pasha told him that he had recommended the Turkish War Office to exchange the Kut prisoners on parole in view of the difficulties of the proposed march through Mesopotamia, but that the Turkish War Office refused.According to Dr. J. E. McLean, Mr. Hoffman Philip, of the U.S. Embassy at Constantinople, seems to have urged Sulieman Nouman Pasha (Director of the Army Medical Department) to prevent this march. The Foreign Office should be asked if they can approach the American Government with a view to securing the evidence of Mr. Philip as. to this, and also as to his dealings with the Turkish Government in connection with the prisoners.Major-General Sir C. V. F. Townshend, in a letter of the 15th February, 1917, to D.C. I.I.T., War Office, states that on the 26th April, Ehalil Pasha wrote to him: &quot; Soyez sur soit de vivres, soit de transport pour Baghdad, soit pour le paiement de vos soldats. Ay ant fait depuis 5 mois votre devoir si heroiquement, vous et vos soldats, vous aurez le meme accueil en Turquie qu&apos;Osman Pacha (le heros de Plevna) avait en Russie.&quot; Khalil Pasha assured the General, in conversation at Baghdad, that every possible care would be taken of his officers and men, and that they would be placed in healthy localities in Asia Minor.The General is convinced that Khalil Pasha was actuated by most honourable sentiments; but that the treatment which ensued was due to the influence of the German Staff, in order to prevent any rapprochment between Great Britain and Turkey. Enver Pasha himself told the General in 1917 that he would have ex-changed the prisoners at the fall of Kut, but that the Germans would not hear of it. Enver Pasha, who was i in Baghdad, must have known of Khalil Pasha&apos;s correspondence with General Townshend and of the promises made. If he was induced to break these promises by German influence, he must bear the consequences of the inhumanity for which he was responsible.General Sir Charles Melliss, who travelled along the same route a?.i the prisoners, telegraphed to Khalil Pasha that something must,be done to alleviate their lot, and when he reached the neighbourhood of Constantinople urged on Enver - Pasha the necessity of immediate action, but was met by Enver Pasha with the statement that he did not believe his account.  Nothing was
done. Enver Pasha, as the head of the War Office, was respon-flible for seeing that the prisoners were humanely treated, and he is directly and not merely technically responsible, as he was on the spot at the critical period, and had his attention called to the barbarous conditions of this march, and yet did nothing to render the conditions tolerable. The attention of the Turkish Government was called to the necessity of providing food, for Mr. Hoffman Philip offered to send supplies to Baghdad for the Kut prisoners in the Spring of 1916, but this offer was refused by the Turkish Red Orescent, who can hardly have acted in this way without consulting the Government. The names of the Turkish Red Crescent officials are given in the Report of Messrs. Boissier and Vischer.Witnesses available for selection include:Major-Genl. Sir C. V. F. Townshend. Major-Genl.

Kents.2, Responsibility foe Treatment of Prisoners in Camps, Prisons and Hospitals.On the fall of Kut, Khalil Pasha assured General Townshend that every possible care should be taken of his officers and men, and that they should be placed in healthy localities in Asia Minor. (See under (1).) Khalil Pasha, in General Townshend&apos;s view, was genuine in making these promises; but the Turkish War Office certainly did not carry them out.The conditions in the camps varied. Some were tolerable, others were atrocious. Many of the prisoners were set to work on the extension of the Baghdad Railway to Mosul. This railway was being constructed by German Contractors, and the prisoners were handed over to the contractors&apos; engineers. The lot of the prisoners was in many cases pitiable irregularity of rations, insufficient clothing, insufficient tent accommodation so that the prisoners had to lie out in all weathers, compulsory work even
when suffering from serious illness, brutal treatment, in many cases inadequate medical attendance and supplies, so that when an epidemic of typhus broke out they died like flies. In many cases their rations were cut off when they were too ill to work. In some camps the accommodation was deplorable. The number of deaths, both of British and Indian Prisoners of War in the camps was very large. Colonel Jusuf Fuad Zia Bey was Inspector General on the Bagdad line from early 19.16; but both Mr. J. F, McLean and Mr. J. A. Sykes describe him as &quot; a good man.&quot;Kemal Bey appears to have been in charge of the Prisoners of War Department and to have acted as intermediary between the War Office and the Camp Commanders.   (Mr. J. F. McLean.)The Turkish War Office even subjected the sick to reprisals in the Tash Kishla Hospital at Constantinople (Turkish Camps, Prisons and Hospitals Tash Kishla Hospital).According to Mr. J. A. Sykes (Member of the Constantinople Committee), requests made by the American Embassy and the Dutch Legation to the Turkish War Office through the Turkish Foreign Office for the betterment of the camps, or the trans-mission of food, clothing and parcels, and for the better treat ment of the prisoners in hospitals, were completely ignored; and Mr. Sykes states that his Committee vainly endeavoured, through the Red Crescent and privately through the Turkish War Office from June to December, 1917, to secure the despatch of clothing, food and money which they had collected, their requests being refused &quot;for military reasons,&quot; although Turkish merchants were during this period allowed, to use the railway for their purposes.Mr. Menten, when he was officially visiting the Prisoners of War Camps in the autumn of 1918, was not permitted to inspect some working camps, e.g., those in the neighbourhood of Angora, the conditions of which appear from the evidence to have been very bad. (See Note Verbale of Dutch Legation to Turkish War Office of i2th October, 19.18.)Kemal Bey (acting Chief of the Turkish Prisoners of War Department) told Mr. Emil Ernest Menten (Dutch Attache at Constantinople) that the War Office blocked the way. The Commandant of Magnesia Camp told Mr. Menten that he could not change the conditions of the Camp, as he had orders from Kemal Pasha (?Bey), and when the Dutch Minister and Mr. Menten visited Psamatia Camp and criticised its filthy condition and the lack of water the Commandant stated that he would like to do better, but that he could not depart from the orders that he had received from the Turkish War Office.There is another piece of direct evidence affecting Enver Pasha. Between June and September, 1916, he travelled through Ras-el-ain on the way from Constantinople to Baghdad, and must have passed through some at least of these Camps.   (Major C. S.
1783. Reprisals.(a) Reprisals on Capt. Brodie and Four Others .-^-These Jive Officers were collected from different Camps by the Turkish War Office for the purpose of exposing them to a reprisal for some alleged ill-treatment of Turkish prisoners in Cairo. From the telegrams produced by the War Office it appears that there was no justification or excuse for the severe reprisals inflicted on if permitted by their governments to give evidence.Houghton, I.M.S.) It may be &quot;that he did not make enquiries, or perhaps see much of what was going on; but he had been informed by Sir Charles Melliss of the conditions of the march, and ought to have taken steps to enquire as to the condition of the prisoners.On at least one occasion Enver Pasha seems to have inspected a working camp, i.e., at Oolash, near Sivas (Pte. H. L. Turner).It would be very important to obtain evidence from the American Embassy and the Dutch Legation as to their com-munications with the Turkish Government, and it may be desirable to enquire of the Foreign Office whether it is possible to ask the American and Dutch Governments to allow their representatives to give evidence. The necessity of making some such application seems to apply also to Mr. Menten, the Dutch Attache. Information seems also to have been obtained from the Turkish Minister at Berne, Kemal Pasha and Refke Bey. Whether they and Fuad Zia Bey would give evidence against Enver Pasha, and, if they were willing to do so, whether it would be wise to give them an opportunity should be considered.The evidence seems to show that the W.O., having promised good conditions, left the prisoners exposed to the most shocking hardships and barbarities, and deliberately declined or neglected to improve their lot, and prevented others from doing so.Witnesses:Major-General Sir C. V. F. Townshend, Major-Genl. Sir C. Melliss, Mr. J. A. Sykes, Mr. Dirk van Bommel, Major S. G. S. Haughton, Mr. Hoffman Philip, Mr. Menten,and other members of theU.S. Embassy and DutchLegation    at    Constanti-nople.Pte. H. L. Turner (9th W. Torks. Regt.), and witnesses mentioned in &quot; Turkish Camps, Prisons and Hospitals&quot; (including Bagtche, Afion Kara Hissar, Angora and Mosul). ,
the officers (see Annexe 1). Flight Commander G. Bentley Dacre and Lieut. Flynn were token from Afion Kara Hissar, while the other three were taken from the Armenian Quarter Camp (No. 1 Camp). All were taken to Constantinople in March, 1917. On the 17th they went to the War Office, where they saw Colonel Djevad Bey (Commandant de la Place), and were sent by him to the Seraskierat (or War Office) Prison. They were searched and then locked up in an underground cell, 25 ft. by 12 ft. On the 19th they were allowed to walk in the gaol garden for half an hour, and obtained a charcoal fire, but these concessions were not repeated. On the 22nd March the Gaol Commandant told them that they were suffering reprisals in consequence of the bad treatment of five Turkish officers, who were said to have been imprisoned in Cairo in cells and allowed no exercise, and that one of them had fallen ill and received no medical attention. They were then placed in a cell (12 ft. by 12 ft.) in an outhouse in which criminals were usually confined. The only ventilation came from one small window (1 ft. by 1 ft.). The cell was infested with vermin. After being 4 or 5 hours in this cell among 40 criminals they were removed to another under-ground cell (20 ft. by 12 ft.) with one window, very filthy, and swarming with vermin. They were not allowed to have their luggage and bedding for three weeks. They were refused per-mission to communicate with the American Ambassador. They were not allowed to have any exercise. On the 6th April Captain Brodie fell ill. The others asked repeatedly that a Doctor should be sent for. On the 8th he was taken to the gaol Infirmary and given a dose of salts. On the 9th he was worse, and after repeated demands a doctor visited him and promised to send medicine, but none came. In the afternoon he was again taken to the dispen-sary and given salts. Captain Brodie by this time was yellow all over, and finally, on the 10th, he was taken to the Malteppe&apos; Hospital, which then was full of typhus cases, was used only for Turkish soldiers, and is said to have been very filthy. There he died. The remaining four prisoners were kept in the cell till the latter part of May, when they were moved to a room upstairs. On the 28th June they were told the reprisal was at an end, and on the 4th May they were sent back to the Camps in Asia Minor. During the whole of this imprisonment, up to the 28th June (over three months), they had an hour&apos;s walking exercise, on one day they were allowed to- go to&apos; Church, and they had about six baths. They had to buy their food at very high prices.There seems to be no doubt that the ill-treatment was deliberate on the part of the Turkish War Office. As appears from documents, printed in Annexe II. hereto, obtained from the Turkish War Office, the order for this reprisal was given by the Commander-in-Chief (Enver Pasha) and was Communicated by von Back Pasha and Kemal Eddin to Djevad Bey (the Commandant de la Place). The reprisal on these prisoners had been previously arranged between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Commander-in-Chief,   But it may be doubted
173. (6) Reprisal on Major Brett.Major Brett was taken from Angora and sent to Sivas. A telegram from Enver was read to him. It stated that Bimbashi Brett was to go to Sivas as a private soldier as a reprisal for the mal-treatment of Bimbashi Ismail Hakki Bey. As appears from documents, printed in Annexe II. hereto, obtained from the Turkish War Office, the order for his removal to Sivas was signed by Lieut.-Col. Rushdi Bey, who was Chief of the Staff, and von Back Pasha, the Inspector-General of Lines of Communication. Enver Pasha was Deputy Commander-in-Chief. This may be the order to which Major Brett refers, Von Back and Rushdi ordered that he should be treated as a simple soldier at Sivas, but they forbade the Commandant to make him work &quot; as the privates.&quot; He was not allowed out of the train on the journey to would Eishla, or to communicate with the British officers in the train, and he was unable to get any food, except by buying bread from station hawkers. At would Kishla he was confined in the police station without any bed or bedding, and was put in a wooden cage in the yard (2 ft. deep in snow, the temperature many degrees below freezing). The other occupants of the cage were brigands, who attacked him, and he had to fight for his clothes, losing such food as he had in the struggle. By bribing the sentry he got back to the police station. He was taken in a cart to Nigde, where he had to sleep on the floor of the police station without any fire or food. The next day he obtained a little bread from the driver of the cart on the way to Inge Loo. At Inge Loo &quot;he was again placed in the common policeman&apos;s room and no food was provided for.him. It was bitterly cold. At Kaiseria he was at first placed in the common gaol, but after loud protests he was removed to the barracks. For three days he was not allowed to buy any food, but a Turkish N.C.O. took pity on him and gave him some of his own food. He was then taken on to Sivas, but always had to sleep on. the floor at the villages at which they stopped. At Sivas he was placed in the police station, worn out by starvation and hard-ship, and bribed the policeman to get him some bread and sweet-meat. He was then taken to a monastery full of Russian pri-vates and very filthy; and after being placed in the Turkish sentries&apos; room succeeded in getting a bed in the Turkish N.C.O.&apos;s room. In:this room he lived for 30 days, only obtaining food by bribery.   He was compelled to chop firewood.   After th*whether the letter in question (17 Sept. is correctly-translated.Witnesses:Flight Commander G. Bentley Dacre, R.A.F. Lieut. G. Crosby Flynn, 103 Mahratta L.I. Lieut. W. H. Treloar, A.F.C.

expiration of the month he was returned to Afion Kara Hissar, the order for his return being given by von Back Pasha and Rushdi.A War Office memorandum on the treatment of Ismail Hakki Bey is annexed (see Annexe II).Witness:   .Major Brett, R,E.4. Treatment of Major Tod, Major Cree and Others.Major Tod was in Bagdad when the war with Turkey broke out. Mirza Ali seems to have been at Basra. Major (then Mr.) Tod was allowed to leave Turkey. He, Major Cree, Mr, Dexter (assistant of Col. Taylor, the Military Governor), and Mirza Ali (Gen. Delamain&apos;s interpreter) were captured at Kut, They were told by a German that they were to suffer special treatment and be accused of breaking parole. At Bagdad they were confined for a month in a small room in the heat of summer and the authorities refused to give them food. On the 15th p May, 1916, they were sent for trial to Aleppo; there for a month they were imprisoned in a small room without even blankets, They had no exercise and lived on food bought with money sup-plied by the American Consul. There Major Cree was ill, but Chawkri Pasha (a Kurd) refused to do anything. They reached Constantinople on the 5th August, 1916, and were kept in prison there till the 7th July, 1917, in the Seraskierat (War Office) prison. They were kept in underground cells with Turkish criminals and deserters. On the 22nd August Major Cree was removed to hospital in a delirious condition, and returned to prison on the 16th September. Next day, Major Cree, Major Tod and Mr. Dexter were transferred to the condemned cells! (7 ft. by 5 ft.). Major Tod was frequently brought before a special tribunal, and ultimately found that he was charged&apos; with j (a) inciting an Arab revolt in Constantinople, (6) breaking j parole, and (c) wearing uniform, though a civilian. Not one of these charges was true. On the 5th October he was measured for his drop, and was told he was to be hanged on 7th October. Enver Pasha, after much pressure by the Papal Legation, agreed to cancel the order for execution. On the 7th July, 1917, he was sent to Broussa, to the Indian compound, where he was treated as a private soldier and remained there until the armistice.Major Cree&apos;s account and that of Mirza Ali are similar. They, too, were told that they were to be hanged, and they, too, were sent to Broussa.The treatment of these four men was wholly inexcusable, ever) \ if there had been any foundation for the charges made against them.   It will be noted that the charge of inciting an Arabi revolt in Constantinople, which was fanciful, related to thef period after he arrived in that city, and much of the treatment
3aroh heiandimplained of occurred before he reached the city. The treat-mt was plainly the result of orders from the War Office.jjjj Witnesses:Major Cree, Major Tod, and Mirza Ali.5. Treatment of British Officers at Changri.In October, 1917, a number of British officers were sent from lastamouni to Changri. This place is described by the Rev. larold Spoaner, who accompanied the officers. The officers rere placed in Turkish barracks which apparently had not been leaned for years, there being a thick layer of manure on the oors. The barracks swarmed with mosquitoes and vermin; in ummer even Turkish troops were not put into the barracks, fhe windows had no glass in them; there were great holes in the Joors. There were no beds or furniture of any kind and the ^ianitation, according to Mr. Spooner, was indescribable, and the ?lajpells were horrible. Although it was bitterly cold many ^Jffficera preferred to sleep in the open.5fll A notice was put up stating that if any officer tried to escape nt]fjhe whole party would be sent to a small village in Anatolia. etslt11 ^e ^*h October a telegram arrived purporting to come from iUpjpwer in these terms: &quot; Any officer who gives his parole is to be buIent to a suitable camp and given his liberty.&quot; The parole heJphich the officers were required to sign was in the following soJerms: &quot;On condition that I am transferred to a good camp [ce]lnd receive reasonable liberty, and the accommodation suitable :ismor officers, I hereby give my word of honour to make no attempt waMo escape whilst a prisoner of war in Turkey.&quot; Seventy-seven tjjfficera signed it, and forty-four refused. The forty-four were gojfonfined to a wing of the barracks and their condition became elljlteadily worse. The weather was bitterly cold and it was diffi-e Jsult to obtain wood even for cooking purposes. They received ithfto parcels until January, 1918. In December, Lieut. Jenkins, inJhieut. Johnston and Lieut. Sheridan, who had refused to give . bffheir parole, were sent to Changri from another camp as a punish-jinent.   On the 11th April, 1918, the officers were sent to Tosgad.The facts seem to show that the officers were sent to Changri [for the purpose of compelling the-m to give their parole. JEnver Pasha&apos;s telegram and the form of the parole both point to the fact that it was well known to the authorities that Changri jvas a wholly unsuitable place of imprisonment.Witnesses:The Rev.

We recommend that Enver Pasha be tried on the above, mentioned charges, and that von Back Pasha and Lieut.-Col Rushdi Bey be also brought to trial in connection with the treat ment of Major Brett, and that Djebad Bey be tried for the mal-treatment of Captain Brodie and his four co-prisoners.II.Kemal Bey.He was the acting head of the Prisoners of War Department and responsible for the Prisoners of War Camps.Since the armistice he appears to have taken up the position that the obstruction to all reasonable improvement in the con-ditions came not from him but from a higher source (i.e., Enver). He was, however, the effective head of the Prisoners of War Department of the Turkish War Office. He should be scheduled for prosecution. This would probably induce him to turn King&apos;s evidence and supply much useful information on the subject of Enver Pasha.Witnesses:Same as Enver Pasha (2).III.Khalil Pasha, Commander of the Turkish Troops at Kut-el-Amara.Charges: 1. That he did not carry out terms of capitulation.2. That he did not make provision for the Prisoners of War on their march after the fall of Kut to Bagdad.1. From the documents produced by the War Office it appears that the forces at - Kut-el-Amara were unconditionally sur-rendered. But Major-Genl. Townshend states that Khalil assured him that all possible care should be taken of the prisoners, and that they should be sent to healthy localities in Asia Minor. (See Enver Pasha, and see his letter to General Townshend of 26 April, 1918, under Enver Pasha.) Major N. Y. L. Rybot says that there were three breaches of the capitulation:  (a) That the prisoners should be the honoured and cherished guests of the Ottoman Government;(6) That 1,000 tents should be pitched a few miles up-stream to form a rest camp;(c) That supplies should be brought to the rest camp from the British forces to the South of Kut;
131General Townshend&apos;s view (see his letter of the 15 February, 1919, to D.C.I.G.S., War Office) clearly is that Khalil is a chivalrous man, who was actuated by most honourable senti-ments, and that he was prevented from carrying out his promises by Enver, under the influence of the German Staff; and on the ne$present material, we are inclined to think this is the correct view. It must be remembered that Enver was in Bagdad at the fall of IKut (see Enver (1)), and Khalil was his subordinate. tiJeo! Witnesses:Major-Genl. Sir C. V. F. Townshend. Major N. V. L. Rybot.2. Khalil told Gen. Sir Charles Melliss that he would have sent the P.O.W. up-stream in boats if he had had the coal, and that the British relieving force had refused coal for the purpose. In Sir Charles Mellies&apos; view this statement was made because Khalil knew of the exhausted condition of the men. Apparently be inspected the prisoners at Shamram. (Sir Charles Melliss). But the person who was directly responsible for sending sick and unfit men on the march from Shamram was the Turkish Medical Officer who inspected them and determined which of the prisoners should proceed. Sir Charles Melliss, at Tekrit, sent back a report to Khalil urging that transport should be sent up with medical assistance; but there is nothing to show that the Report was received by Khalil. On the other hand, Khalil appears to have told Gen. Townshend that he represented to the Turkish W.O. that in view of the difficulty of the proposed march the prisoners should be exchanged on parole, but that the Turkish W.O. rejected the proposal. General Townshend and Lieut.-Col. H. E. Winsloe, R.E., evidently consider Khalil Pasha to be a chivalrous and honourable man, and above all Enver Pasha was at Bagdad at this time, and he was both War Minister and Commander-in-Chief.   (See Enver Pasha (c).)It would be difficult to bring home criminal culpability to Ehalil Pasha on the present material.Witnesses:Sir Charles Melliss,Major S. G. S. Houghton,General Townshend.Lieut.-Col. H. E. Winsloe, R.E.iboi but we do not find any trace of these terms in the documents to ;,.(Jwb.ich our attention has been called; for the letter of Khalil trJPasha to Sir C. V. F. Townshend of the 26th April, 1918 (see mlEnver), appears to be in the nature of a reassuring statement and not to contain terms of capitulation.
ANNEXE I.The Treatment of Certain Turkish Officers by the British Government.(1) In response to telegraphic complaints by Turkish Govern- j ment as to the imprisonment at Kasr-el-Nil of five Turkish Officers, P.W. Department telegraphed Egypt for report on 5th April, 1917.(2) Egypt replied April 20th, 1917:-That it was difficult to trace them but they seemed to be certain named officers who had been received from the Hedjaz in July, 1916, and treated in every way like other officer prisoners of war. Captain Ahmed Fahmy, who had attempted to escape, had undergone a sentence of military confinement.(3) Above was communicated to U.S. Ambassador April 25th.

They announced their intention to imprison five English officers until assured the five Turks had been set at liberty.This was despatched to our F.O. by American Embassy on April 23rd.(5) Letters were subsequently received from the British officers concerned announcing that they were imprisoned at Constanti-nople.

It is believed that while there they, with many others expressed their willingness to join the forces of the Sherif oi Mecca, if they were sent to Egypt.The experiment was tried, but, at any rate so far as these four were concerned, without success, as on arrival in the Hedjaz they refused to fulfil their promise and were then sent to Kasr-el-Nil Barracks to await disposal. While there they were properly fed and received the ordinary treatment of officer prisoners of war and were shortly after sent to an ordinary internment camp.The fifth officer was captured by the French near Crete, but subsequently handed over to us. He also appears to have been detained for a short time for purposes of enquiry prior to his removal to an ordinary internment camp.ANNEXE II.

As the hostile States apply reprisals to the prisoners of war, it is necessary to pay 4.4.5 prs. the prisoners of war working in public works, and who, as it has been known, used to get in some places 1.5.2 prs. per day; this is in order to prepare a basis of good treatment for our own prisoners.2. Out of this pay the expense of food and that contracted up to now are to be deducted; the remaining money, after the cover-ing of food and other expenses, is to be reserved to them as pocket-money and kept in the prisoners of war camp cash-box.3.

On the departure of the Embassy staff, however, he was not included in the party by &quot;the Turkish Authorities, presumably not being considered to have a diplomatic status. He was first interned on the 17th November, 1915, as a civilian at Alexandra Palace.In a Note Verbale, dated 1.1th January, 1916, the Turkish Government complained of the conditions under which Hakki and other Turks were interned, contrasting it unfavourably with the treatment accorded to British subjects in Turkey, and threatening reprisals. As the Note in question referred! to Hakki as Capitaine de Corvette, enquiry was immediately made as to his status, although he Ead not been taken prisoner as a
MEMORANDUM I (ii).(i) Bagtche Working Camp.Bimbashi Aeiff Bey, Commandant. Here Clauss, Sene., 1 ^   . Here Clauss, June., j Engineers.Charge: Brutal Treatment of Prisoners of War.Bimbashi Arifi Bey was commandant of this working camp. The prisoners (British and Indian) were handed over to the Messrs. Clauss, who were the engineers for the German con-tractors for the completion of the Bagdad Railway to Mosul. According to the evidence the Messrs. Clauss are Austrian Jews. The men were weak and emaciated after their experiences in Kut and on the march from Kut.   They were required to workcombatant, but according to his own statement, it appeared that he was only a merchant captain. Subsequently, however, he stated he was a Commander in the Turkish Navy, and it was decided to recognise him as a naval officer, and to transfer him to an officers&apos; camp, a decision of- which the Turkish Govern-ment was duly apprised. He was accordingly transferred to the officers&apos; camp at Donington Hall on the 23rd February, 1916. In that camp he was treated in every way as an officer, and on many occasions wrote in appreciative terms of the treatment he received there.The entry of Major Brett into the case first came to the notice of the War Office by reason of a letter which this officer addressed to his wife from Sivas on the 7th March, .1916, in which he stated that he was interned there as a reprisal with Russian privates. The United States Ambassador was immediately re-quested to enquire as to the grounds for this unwarrantable proceeding on the part of the Ottoman Authorities, and to take such steps as might be possible to obtain proper treatment for this officer.On the 25th April the American Ambassador announced that according to a telegram received from the Charge d&apos;Affaires at Constantinople, Major Brett had now rejoined the other officers at Afion Kara Hissar. Subsequently the American Embassy at Constantinople wrote that the transfer of Major Brett to Sivas was ordered as a reprisal for the ill-treatment of Ismail Hakki Bey.Both while at Alexandra Palace and at Donington Hall Hakki Bey received every consideration, and there is not the slightest ground for the suggestion of ill-treatment made by the Turkish Government, nor any justification for the intolerable treatment accorded to Major Brett.
long hours as ordinary labourers and navvies. Sick men were compelled to work and men were flogged and bastinadoed on the slightest excuse, often without any excuse, by the gangers or by the Messrs. Clauss themselves. Many of the men died. The hospital accommodation was hopelessly deficient, and the sick lay on the floors, of the halls and passages, while numbers, of sick men were turned away owing to want of accommodation. Many died in tents without any medical attention. Men who were too unfit to work but had not been moved into hospital, received no ration or only a bread ration, the engineers&apos; view, apparently, being that if they did not work they were not entitled to call upon the contractors for food, while the Com-mandant did not feel the necessity of taking any steps to see that they were fed. The cost of feeding the sick in hospital was debited against the pay of the men who worked.In, August, 1916, the death rate sometimes reached 15 per diem; and between June and September, 1916, 215 out of 600 died. There seems to be ground for believing that the men were defrauded of their pay by the contractors&apos; officials, and Herr Clauss, Junr., is suspected of having participated in the plunder. The so-called hospital was indescribable. The latrine in the hospital was a cess-pit flagged over, with slots for squatting and the stench permeated the building. The attendants often allowed the bed-ridden patients to remain un-attended for days and seem to have beaten them unmercifully when the fancy took them to do so probably (as in the case of some other hospitals) when the patients suffering from dysen-tery, who were too weak to move without assistance, dirtied their beds. Herr Clauss refused to sanction the expenditure of money on improvements of any kind. On the 9th September, 1916, the remaining British prisoners, most of them hospital patients, were, with the exception of five, irrespective of disease or sick-ness, forcibly taken to the station and despatched in open trucks to Angora and Afion Kara Hissar. Most of them by this time were half naked and hardly any possessed blankets or boots. Next day one of the remaining five (Conductor Quigley) found two prisoners lying beside the rails in front of the station, one dead, the other in a semi-conscious condition. Herr Clauss was informed of the fact and said that he would attend to the matter. Nothing was done for two hours and the living man died. Two days later a similar case occurred. Quigley told Herr Clauss where a desperately sick man was lying near the railway, and Herr Clauss promised to send a stretcher party for him, &quot;Five hours later Quigley, returning from work, found the man still there. Herr Clauss excused himself by saying that the stretcher party he had sent had not been able to find the man. If this was true, which we think unlikely, it does not seem to have occurred to Herr Clauss that the least he could do was to send for Quigley to show a stretcher party where the man was.   This man also died.The treatment at Bagtche and the callous method of despatch-ing the sick in trucks seem to have been the same in the summer of 1917.
The Commandant, Ariff Bey, appears to have received a salary and ration allowance from the contractors and to have been entirely at the beck and call of the engineers.When the cold weather set in the prisoners suffered from want of clothing, but the engineers took no steps to provide clothing out of their stores, and the prisoners were not permitted to com-municate with any Consulate or Embassy which had the charge of British interests for the purpose of obtaining the necessary clothing.  Bagtche is described as a &quot; valley of Death.&quot;We recommend that the Commandant and both of the Engineers be tried for gross inhumanity.Witnesses available for selection:Oapt. R. Y.

(ii) Afion-Kara-Hissar Working Camp.Muzloum Bey, the Turkish Naval Officer who acted under Muzlocm Bey (whose name appears to be Suleiman Bey) : Commandant and Assistant Commandant.Muzloum Bey was Commandant of the Camp at Afion-Kara-Hissar. He had an Assistant Commandant who was a Turkish Naval, Officer and whose photograph is to be found amongst the evidence taken by the Alexandria commission. This man&apos;e name appears to have been Suleiman Bey. This camp in the time of Muzloum was one of the worst in Asia Minor. Through-out the evidence Muzloum is depicted as a ferocious brute, while the Naval Officer was almost as bad. Muzloum was finally, at the instance of the British officers, tried for various offences, including theft and sodomitical practices to which he compelled some of the prisoners to submit. He appears to have been con-victed for some of these offences, but not for sodomy; but the punishment inflicted upon him must have been slight as it was only after vigorous protest by the officers that the Turkish authorities refrained from restoring him to Afion as second in command. Under his successor conditions in the camp were im-proved. While there can be little doubt that Muzloum Bey was guilty of sodomy with some of the prisoners, the Sub-Committee considers that it would be inexpedient in the interest of his victims to bring him to trial on this charge, as their evidence would be necessary to support the charge and the taint might cling to them during their lives. There is ample evidence on which this tyrant can be brought to account without making the specific charge of sodomy against him. Many of the Kut pri-soners reached this place in a state of extreme exhaustion, suffering from dysentery and other diseases. The hospital accommodation was disgraceful, and the patients were treated with extraordinary brutality by the doctors and orderlies. The spirit of Muzloum Bey seems to have permeated both hospital authorities and guards. The use of the bastinado was constant and wholesale. Muzloum and Suleiman themselves repeatedly flogged the prisoners. There is a horrible account of the way in which Muzloum flogged a Russian officer, which throws con-siderable light on the attitude of this man to the unfortunate men who came under his power. Suleiman on one occasion flogged 17 British sergeants. The evidence teems with com-plaints of the. brutality of these two men, as well as of the guards and the officials in the hospital. The two commandants were callously indifferent to the condition of the prisoners. Of the Kut prisoners 200 died in six weeks; but the British medical officers were not allowed to attend to the medical needs of the prisoners. The men were confined in filthy quarters. They, of course, were lousy; and by way of encouraging them in the impossible task of cleaning themselves in such conditions, Sulei-man Bey on some occasions endeavoured to compel the men to swallow the lice found on them. The food was scarce and bad; the men, although weak and sick, were driven with blows to the work which was very hard.    The two commandants stole the30962
men&apos;s parcels and appropriated the men&apos;s pay. The men&apos;s clothing and money were taken by them, their overcoats being given to the guards. Bedding and clothes which had been sent for the benefit of the prisoners were sold by the commandant. Even the clothing of the men who went into hospital was sold by auction in the town by Muzloum. Apparently, by way of indignity, the men, when they were allowed a bath, were marched to the baths stark naked. The British chaplains were even pro-hibited from holding services or taking part in the burial of the dead. One of the prisoners (Private T. Harvey) states that Muzloum gave orders that the prisoners should be treated as roughly as possible. This may not be authentic; but the result was the same as if he had done so. . The main stress of systematic brutality fell.upon the N.C.O.&apos;s and privates; but the officers did not escape. They were strictly confined for reasons which were not apparent to them, and this confinement was relaxed without any apparent reason. Those who refused to give their parole were very stringently treated. First-class Sub-Assistant Surgeon Abdul Kay urn, I.M.S., was placed under close arrest in his own room for nine months for reporting the malpractices of the two Commandants to the British officers.In the view of the Sub-Committee,. Muzloum Bey and the Naval Officer in command under him (? Suleiman Bey) should ho broupht to trial.Witnesses available for selection :* UM. E. F. E. Baines, I.M.S. Lt.-Col. Corbould Warren, R.F.A.

Ombashi Soliman. Mohammed Bey. saditin (or Saditin) Effendi.There was a considerable number &quot;of working camps in the neighbourhood of Angora, the prisoners being employed in the construction of the railway line from that towu to Sivas and thence to Erzeroum. The construction of this line appears to have been under the Turkish Government and not to have been undertaken by German contractors as in the case of the extension of the Bagdad Railway from Ras-al-Ain to Mosul. The Com-mandant, who was the local head of this construction work, was Lieutenant-Colonel Osman Bey. In the vicinity of Angora were wveral working camps:  (1) No. 2 Camp 3rd Regiment, of which the Commandant seems to have been an Arab, whose name is Ombashi Soliman,. Commandants.
(2) No. 3 Camp, No. 7 Railway Regiment, of which Lutvey or Luthi Bey was Commandant. Takir Effendi is described as Company Commandant, but on the evi-dence as it stands it is impossible to say whether he was- a subordinate of Lutvey or whether he preceded or succeeded him.(3) No. 12 Camp, of which Ahmed Kilmi Bey or Mahomet Kilmi Bey was Commandant.(4) Mamak, of which Nazim or Nissam Effendi was Com-mandant. Three of the witnesses describe him as being Commandant of No. 2 Company Eeurche Regi-ment.(5) Kressle or Kruchle. This seems to have been a punish-ment camp.(6) Hassan Oghla, of which Saditin or saditin Effendi was Commandant under Osman Bey.Angora.The Commandants of these working camps were under Osman Bey, who was responsible for the management of the camps and the general treatment of the prisoners in them. According to the Revd. Harold Spooner, Osman Bey was an &quot;absolute brute,&quot; who was responsible for the numerous deaths which occurred, especially in Camps Nos. 3 and 12. He seems to have been cou-sidered by the British officers to be mentally deficient (Rev. H. Spooner). At Angora some British officers were confined in small rooms which were very overcrowded, dirty and verminous (the only furniture being an old bedstead), until in consequence of the confinement they became ill. The restrictions imposed upon them were, as Osman told them, a reprisal for the bad treatment of Turkish prisoners in Egypt. Mr. Spooner was for-bidden to visit the prisoners or even the sick, or to hold services. Requests for better treatment of the men were ignored. The men in Angora were placed in an old verminous building, with-out any bedding, in a cold winter; but apparently this was also the.lot of Turkish workmen.   (Serjeant W. Bailey.)1 No, 2 Camp. This camp was pitched on marshy ground, and in consequence the prisoners suffered from malaria and typhus. At the end of three weeks the camp was moved to a distance of two miles; but the conditions were such that, at the end of nine months out of about 160 men only 60 remained alive. (Private Carpenter.) One of the witnesses (Private Luther Thomas, 27th Royal West Kents) gives further information as to this - Camp. The place seems to have been called Kulbala. The officer in charge of No. 3 Regt. at Kulbala was Mohammed Bey. The officer in charge of, the prisoners was Ombashi Soliman. The men were ill-treated and not given sufficient food and Soliman alleged that they did not work hard enough. Soliman picked out Thomas as a ringleader and reported him to the Yusbashi in charge of the camp. Two Turkish Serjeants held Thomas down and he was flogged unmercifully and then sent to Kressle.
No. 3 Camp. This was a very bad camp, while it was under Lutvey Bey and Takir Effendi. When Sherif Bey became Com-mandant he seems to have done what he could for the prisoners. In the time of Lutvey and Takir the men suffered from exposure, starvation and sickness. Typhus broke out; but no steps were taken to deal with the epidemic. The sick were left with the others, who were infected in their turn. The disease spread in consequence of the Commandant&apos;s, refusal&apos; to supply change of clothing or fresh tent accommodation.,&apos;, The sick, with their clothes in rags, without soles to their shoes, were driven out with whips to work in the snow. The rations were small and bad, the men were billeted in tents without any fuel, although it snowed and the weather was very cold. Whipping, beating and kicking appear to have been general. The treatment in the so-called hospital seems to have been very brutal. There are stories of patients being struck and knocked down while they were wan-dering in the hospital in a delirious condition, and there is evidence that many died in hospital from starvation. In 90 days 38 prisoners died out of 120; and at the end of six months the 120 were reduced to 60. Complaints were unavailing, whether made to the Commandant or to the Doctor. ; .,No. 12 Camp. In this camp the conditions were extremely bad. The men were not supplied with boots or blankets. They had very little clothing and starvation rations. Dysentery, typhus and fever were prevalent; but the rule appears to have been that, so long as a man could stand, he had to work; so that men, suffering from dysentery or fever, were driven to work under the lash of rawhide whips. Men were.only allowed to the latrines in parties and the guards are said to have flogged them on the way to and from the latrines. A man suffering from dysentery would Tush to the gate for the purpose of going to the latrine. There he would have to wait until a party of men euffering from the same necessity was formed; and, if as a result, he dirtied his clothes he was flogged. The .ISr.C.O&apos;s. were, com-pelled to work as they refused to lash the men. In this camp also men were forced to swallow lice, which were found on them and were flogged because they were lousy. The, hospital (so-called), which consisted of some bell tents, was filthy and ver-minous; and no medicines were available. The sick, suffering from dysentery or typhus, had to sleep in their ordinary clothes as no bed clothing was provided. There was no one to attend to them, and the story states that they ended by lying in their own excrement till they died, starved to death &quot; without an ounce of flesh on their bodies.&quot; As one of the witnesses says, it was an &quot; awful sight.&quot; It is said that typhus patients were flogged if they soiled their beds. Some of the prisoners, for laying out&quot; three Turkish soldiers who appeared as orderlies in a new hospital and robbed the dead, were placed in confinement with no: sanitary arrangements and were not allowed to the latrines for three days and then only in parties of ten. In six months out of 73 men only 21 remained alive. Complaints were useless. One of the witnesses says that the treatment of the sick &quot;beggars description,&quot; and Co. Serjt-Major Ailett seems to be justified in saying that this camp was &quot;hellish.&quot;    When parcels arrived.
from England in March, 1917, the men, it is said, were compelled to open them before the commandant, who took whatever he wanted.Mamak Camp. Nazim Effendi was, ultimately, as the result of many complaints, removed by Osrnan Bey and conditions seem to have been greatly improved under his successor, Mogalus, Moeleus or Mouglos Bey. Complaints were made of the accom-modation of this camp in the time of Nazim, as the men had to sleep for months on the bare floors in a filthy and verminous bungalow. Nazim is stated to have been very brutal and cruel and to have thrashed men brutally. He is said to have flogged two prisoners for not shaving their &quot;pudenda&quot; until he was exhausted, in order to make them scream for mercy. In this camp also the Commandant is said to have forced men to swallow lice found on them, and to have flogged some of the prisoners for being verminous. Ultimately, after a personal complaint by a prisoner named Fletcher, to Qsman Bey, the flogging was stopped; but Nazim imprisoned Fletcher for three days without bread or water as a punishment for complaining.Kressle or Kruchle. This seems to have been a punishmentcamp near Angora. Pte. Luther Thomas was kept here 14 days. He says that he was flogged by the sentries every morning and compelled to work all day, and at night he was put into irons. He lived in a cowshed, and had hardly any food and no wash during his stay at this place. He became so weak and ill that he was sent into hospital. He alleges that Osman Bey (see Angora) saw him at the village and was well aware of the treatment which he was undergoing.Hassan Oghla.--Th.is working camp, which some of the witnesses call Hassan Ola or Hasennola, was near Angora and had as its Commandant Saditin or saditin Effendi, under Osman Bey. In 19.16 and 1917 the men were told that, as the Turkish prisoners in English hands were badly treated, they would be treated as slaves. The accommodation was very bad. The men were housed in,dirty and verminous quarters. They were over-crowded, one witness stating.that 12 men had to live in a room which was approximately, 10^ feet by 6: feet. -They had to work throughout the. winter in snow with very little food or.clothing and with old boots which were practically useless. Typhus broke out.     &apos; .....       ,&apos;.-&apos;:&apos;!&apos;.&apos;,&apos;   &apos; \ \]  &apos;(,,!)We recommend that Lieut-Col., Osman Bey, Ahmed or Mahomet Kilmi Bey, Nazim (or Nassim) Effendi, Lutvey or Luthi Bey, Takir Effendi, Ombashi Soliman, Mohammed Bey and saditin (or Saditin) Effendi be brought to trial.Witnesses available for selection: &apos;Rev: Harold Spooner, CF.

Mosul Camp.Ibeahim (or Ismail) Hakki Bey, Abdul Ghani Bey : Commandants.It is uncertain which of these two men was the Commandant of Mosul. Ibrahim (or Ismail) Hakki Bey is stated to have been the Commandant, by Captain T. W. White, who was at Mosul from the 1st December, 1915, to the 15th February, 1916, and by Lieutenant W. H. Treloar, who was there from October, 1915, to February, 1916, while Captain F. Yeats Brown, who was at Mosul from December, 1915, to February, 1916, states that the Commandants name was Abdul Ghani Bey. Probably both men held some kind of a command at Mosul; and as they are both implicated, it will be advisable to deal with both of them.The conditions at Mosul at the end of 1915 and the beginning of 1916 are described in some detail by Major H. Reilly, Captain T. W. White, and Lieutenant W. H, Treloar. Some 200 Indian prisoners and one British prisoner were confined in a dark over-crowded cellar, in conditions of &quot; unbelievable squalor.&quot; Although suffering from dysentery, they were not allowed lo go to the latrines at night; and in the day-time, according to Captain White, only at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., or, according to Captain Yeats Brown, &quot;at the whim&quot; of Arab guards, who struck them and put &quot;every species of indignity &quot; upon them, and required them to give them their puttees and boots before they would allow them to visit the latrines. They were beaten if they soiled their clothes in consequence of these restrictions. Many of the men had nothing but a shirt and trousers. They were starved and not allowed to wash for three weeks although the river was only 200 yards distant, .and they were often kept without drink-ing water for 24 hours at a time. The use of the bastinado was frequent. Sick men were dragged into the Barrack square and Hakki Bey &quot; then kicked, spat and swore at them,&quot; and lashed them with a riding whip until they struggled to their feet, and then declared them fit (Captain White). A batch of prisoners arrived later from Kut in the last stages of exhaustion. They were kicked in order to make them stand up. Some were in the last stages of dysentery, unconscious and dying. Hakki refused stretchers and told the officers that they could carry the men to the hospitals themselves. The officers did so. All but one died in hospital. The Commandant (Hakki Bey) prohibited the purchase of milk for the sick. Major E-eilly complained of the treatment of the men to Hakki Bey, whose only reply was to keep him standing at attention and threaten that, if he complained again, he would be sent to the hills to die of exposure. The men died at the rate of 10 or 12 a week, and some went mad.   Fo*
months the prisoners were maltreated in a &quot; vindictive manner &quot; by the Commandant, who was the cause of many deaths (Captain Yeats Brown).   The hospital conditions seem also to have been bad.   The hospital orderlies treated the sick prisoners in a brutal manner, though, according to Captain Yeats Brown, the treat-ment in the hospital varied.   There were scores of admissions to hospital, but only six men came out alive.   It is said that the sick men were beaten and starved in hospital, and were not given any food unless they paid for it, and that their food was stolen. Mrs. J. King was interned at Mosul from December, 1915, to August, 1916, and was allowed to visit the hospital.  She saw about four British and a number of Indians.   The condition of the British was such, owing to filth and starvation, that she did not recognise them as English.   The English ladies at Mosul gave food and money for the use of the sick; but the Turks pro-vided neither the one nor the other.   Some 250 men were ordered by the Commandant to march to Eas-al-Ain, about 200 miles distant.   He refused to supply them with boots or slippers. Many of the men were quite unfit to march and, when this was pointed out to him, Hakki Bey promised to keep them back; but the promise was not kept, and the sick were compelled to join the others.   These 250 men received hardly any food, they had to sleep out in the rain and frost; and, according to Captain &quot;White, out of the 250 only 50 reached Ras-al-Ain.   Commander Goad states that Conductor (now Lieutenant) Sly can give information as to the horrors of this march.   If he has not made a statement, he should be called upon to do so.The treatment of the officers for the same period (October, 1915, to February, 1916) was also bad, although their sufferings were nothing in comparison with what the men had to endure. Eight of them were confined in two rooms (12 feet by 10 feet) above the cellar in which the men were kept, and were thus able to see much of the treatment to which the men were exposed. They were only allowed into the town four or five times for baths during 2\ months. Fresh air was only to be obtained on the verandah, which was their only exercise ground; but this was often full of Turkish guards, who used it as a latrine. The latrines themselves were near at hand, and the stench from them was very offensive. The ceilings of the rooms leaked, and the officers could not get fuel to warm the rooms. The officers suffered from jaundice and dysentery, but no separate room for the sick was allowed, and medical attention was very difficult to obtain.The conclusion at which Captain Yeats Brown arrived was that the prisoners were kept as miserable as possible in order to &quot; hearten the Turkish soldiers on their way to the front.&quot;In the summer of 1916 there was still much to complain of. This was the period during which large numbers of the Kut prisoners were passing through Mosul. Some 4,000 men, many of them suffering from dysentery, were bivouacked in the barrack square for four days. There was no sanitary arrangements, the only latrine being the open roadside drain, the stench from which waB terrible.   The hospital was crowded; but by this time, as
Captain Spackman, I.M.S., had been installed in it, it had become fairly clean; but the stench from the latrines, which were 50 yards away, was very bad. Men in the last stages of enteritis had to walk to these latrines. The main complaint of the hospital at this time seems to be on the subject of food and the conduct of the orderlies, who appear to have beaten the sick if they soiled their beds, and to have taken them outside and cleaned them by pouring buckets of cold water over them. In June, 1916, Major-General Sir C. Melliss was in Mosul. He found the hospital crowded with sick men under orders to march. He obtained a promise from the Commandant that only those who were passed by the British Medical Officer should be required to march; but as soon as Sir C. Melliss left Mosul, the Com-mandant broke his promise and the men had to march whether sick or whole.   The result was that many of them died.We recommend that Ibrahim (or Ismail) Hakki Bey and Abdul Ghani Bey be brought to trial.Witnesses available :Major-General Sir Charles Melliss, V.C. Eevd. H.

In these cases there appeared to the Committee to be grounds for singling out the commandants as personally responsible for specially inhuman treatment of British and Indian prisoners. But there were many other camps in Turkey in which the prisoners suffered beyond the proper lot of prisoners. In some of these cases there may be difficulty in bringing the commandants before a tribunal; but the mass of the evidence which establishes the sordid con-ditions of the camps and the complete indifference to the welfare of the prisoners may be used in support of the charge that the
Turkish. War Office was responsible for not having made any-reasonable provision for the humane treatment of the unfortunate men who fell into their power, and for not having taken any steps to protect them against wanton outrage or callous, neglect. A few of the prisoners&apos; camps are praised, e.g., Kedos; against some others, such as Magnesia, no serious objection can be taken; but in the case of the great majority of the camps there is good ground of complaint. There appear to have been several causes which led to this result. It is clear from the story of the treat-ment on the march from Kut-el-Amara and the account of the miseries to which batches of prisoners were exposed on the march into the interior that the Turkish authorities had no scruple in sacrificing human life or inflicting unnecessary suffering. This coupled with the dilatory methods of the Turks and their neglect of organisation may account for much. But it should not be forgotten, that there are sinister rumours, which seem to have considerable foundation, that in the earlier stages of the war the Turks did not take any prisoners alive, and that the view of some of the witnesses is that the unnecessary misery and ;-i inflicted upon the prisoners were the result of deliberate calcu-lation for the purpose of diminishing the prestige of the British and &quot;heartening the Turkish troops&quot; who were proceeding to the front. Whatever excuses may be found in the defects of the Turkish character there is this outstanding fact that of the 2,536 British and 10,486 Indian prisoners captured at Kut only 780 and 5,871 respectively have returned. The rest have died from brutality, starvation, neglect and disease. The conditions to which they were subjected ensured the propagation of typhus and dysentery, and if any medical treatment was provided by the Turks it was in most cases of a scandalously insufficient and ineffi-cient character. The sufferings of the prisoners in working camps were accentuated by the desire of the Turkish authorities to press on the construction of the railway from Angora to Sivas aoad thence to Erzeroum, to complete the railway through the Amaiius range, and to fill in the gap in the Baghdad railway between Ras-al-Ain and Mosul. These works were no doubt of great strategical importance, and it seems clear that the Turkish authorities deter-mined to complete these lines, whatever the cost in suffering and death to their hapless prisoners. Thus, at Yarbashi, the German engineer who was in charge of this part of the line is said to have stated in 1917 &quot;that though every British soldier had to die he would have the line finished before August&quot; (No. 422026 Pte. T. H. Weaver, 424163 Pte. P. Richardson and 422427 Pte. W. S. Wright). It is true that Armenian and Turkish workmen seem also to have been engaged in this work of con-struction, and their medical treatment was probably similar to that which the prisoners received; but the prisoners were in other respects in a worse position. If the Turkish Government in dealing with the prisoners chose to shed the last vestiges of humanity, a plea that their treatment of their own subjects was also inhumane could hardly be accepted as a satisfactory defence. In the case of the Tash Kischlar hospital the Turks even sub-jected hospital patients to reprisals.
When they chose, the Turkish authorities were able to supply good treatment, e.g., to British officers who had given parole and Mohammedan Indians whom it was Turkish policy to propitiate, and the &quot; Dispositions Generales du Reglement sur les prisonniers de guerre en Turquie,&quot; communicated by the &quot;Croissant Rouge&quot; and annexed to Messrs. Boissier and Vischer&apos;s Report contain admirable provisions for the treatment of prisoners. Unhappily, no serious attempt seems to have been made id give effect to these Regulations.The following summary indicates the conditions prevailing at various camps, and should be read in connection with the description of the camps at Bagtche, Angora, Afion Kara Hissar, Changri and Mosul which have already appeared in the Report.It will be remembered that the prisoners when they were set to work in the camps were enfeebled by their experiences in the siege of Kut-el-Amara and by the hardships of tffe march into the interior and that many of them were suffering from dysentery and fever. The Turks had taken from the prisoners pocket-cases containing surgical instruments; they missed one; and this was the only set of surgical instruments available for the treatment of 4.500 men. (Captain Puri and Lieut.-Col. J. Hennessey, R.A.M.C.)The Hindu prisoners were in the main employed in corv structing the extension of the Baghdad line to Mosul. The British and Mohammedan Indians were to be found in camps along the Baghdad Line from Bagtche West and North and in the neighbourhood of Angora. A map is annexed, showing the principal places which are referred to in this and earlier reports. Captain Puri, I.M.S., has made a statement which shows very clearly the sections into which the work between Ras-el-Ain and Mosul was divided and supplies the names of the Turkish officials and the German engineers in each section.Hindu Camps in the Sections between Ras-el-Ain and Mosul.The only accommodation provided was an insufficient number of Arab tents without beds or bedding, and the result was that many of the sick had to sleep in the open air. The men tad hardly any clothing, and Captain Puri had to give orders that the clothing of the dead should be kept for the survivors; but permission to communicate with the American Consul at Aleppo on this subject was refused by the Commandant of Ras-el-Ain, Tewfik Bey, who also disregarded all representations on the subject of the accommodation for the sick. He is said to have refused to send the sick to some place where they could be pro-perly treated and to have insisted on taking unfit men from hospital for work. At Ras-el-Ain 448 out of 1,200 Indian prisoners died in 2 months, the result of wilful&apos; neglect (Captain L. Murphy).  Throughout these Sections sick men were
forced to. work and there are many complaints of flogging and bastinadoing. There was a very serious lack of hospital accommodation with the result that many of the sick were forced to remain in the working camps and died without receiving any medical attendance,In December, .1916, there was a serious epidemic of typhus which carried off 2,000 men. in the course of a few months. : There were many cases of gangrened feet and frost-bite which developed maggots in the wounds owing to absence of dressings. Representations appear to have been made in vain to Dr. Lyetwed, the Chief Medical Officer. The rations were inade-quate but ultimately were supplemented from the American Consulate at Aleppo. If the allotted tasks were not performed, owing to weakness or sickness, both rations and pay were with-held. Men often went without food for two or three days. Tewfik 13ey misappropriated  4,000 which had been sent to him for the use of the prisoners. For this theft he was subsequently court-martialled.At Uvenath or Axvanath (N.W. of Mosul) there were 200&apos; sick lying in the open. The Commandant (Ibrahim Effendi) occu-pied the only house, which had only one room. He accepted bribes from the sick to let them into the room at night. The room was filthy; there was no medicine or medical attendance.At Great Arados the Engineer, Herr Ehrler, did not issue rations to the sick and had some of the sound men beaten for refusing to work as a protest. He refused to have a medical officer attached to the men and the mortality was very heavy.At Nisibin and Nisinberg (Commandants iSaleh Bey and Bedri or Budru Bey) the conditions were similar. Men who were suffering from dysentery and fever lay together in the so-called hospital in mud. They received no attention; no milk was pro-vided, although it was plentiful in the town. Cases which were considered desperate were put into a dying ward where they were left to die. The clothes of the dead were appropriated by the Orderlies who quarrelled over the division of the plunder. The conditions of this hospital when the Kut prisoners passed through Nisibin are described by the Rev. Harold Spooner. Men were flogged by Bedri Bey and the head Chaush Krylowitch. The German Engineer, Herr Niegebauer, or Niemeyer, is said to have beaten and kicked prisoners. Complaints of the treatment received were of no use. Later on conditions seem to have improved, so far as British prisoners were concerned.At Aranda there are complaints of flogging by the German Engineer, Herr Pappenberg.; At Kilo 1031-Out of 1,000 men 520 were down with typhus, dysentery and pneumonia. Men who were unfit to work were compelled to do so. A. S. D. L. Mackay, I.M.D.,.gives a record of the deaths which occurred and describes the terrible condition of the sick at Ras-el-Ain and Dema Capu (Demia Kabul). The men in charge at Kilo 1031 seem to have been Herr Pappenberg and Dr. Sabji. Conditions appear to have improved after a visit by Dr. Lyetwed.
At Kilo 1029 there were 400 sick, who were left to shift for themselves, four or five dying each day. In the opinion of A. S. D. L. Mackay, but for the efforts of Captain Puri, no one would have survived.At Telhadi (Tel-el-Elaf), where Herr Foegel was the German Engineer, rations were short and sometimes were not issued at all. The men were forced to work when unfit, and Foegel would not allow any complaints to be made. He was the &quot; evil genius of the place.&quot; The Commandant appears to have been Rafig Effendi (or, as another witness says, Ibrahim Effendi), who is accused of flogging men and in one case breaking a man&apos;s arm. Complaints are made of an official in charge of Tel-el-Shia or Tel Halif in 1917, Paulini or Poleeni. This may be the same place as Telhadi.At Telhelwa Camp a complaint was made to the Engineer in charge, whose name is given as Shatoff, that the men were required to do work too hard for them, and that for some days they had had no rations. The engineer would do nothing; so the complaint was carried to Ibrahim Effendi, at Telhadi, who said that he could no nothing as rationing was the business of the contractors. On the way back the complainant was seized and taken before Herr Schmidt, who beat him with a chair and confined him to camp for six weeks for complaining.Dierbieza, 35 kilometres south of Mardin; Captain Give New-oonib, I.M.S., gives an ^account of the conditions, from Dec. 1, 1916, to October 31, 1917. The Section Chief was Dr. Hauffe. The Divisional Chief was Herr Foelner. The Chief Medical Officer was Dr. Leutveg, who resided in Aleppo. Two of the witnesses state that the Commandants name was Nouri Bey. The soil was clay and very muddy. Frosts begin in October and between December and March the weather is bitterly cold and wet. When Captain Neweomb arrived, 500 Hindus had been . working on the line for some months. The contractors were responsible for the hospital. The conditions were terrible. The men&apos;s clothing was quite insufficient in the frosty weather. Some only had a cotton loin cloth. They lived in Bedouin tents and small dug-outs. There were no sanitary arrangements. They were full of lice, very emaciated; and many were sick from scurvy and diarrhoea resulting from insufficient nutrition. Rations were irregular and inadequate; in many cases, for two days at a time, there were no rations at all. Typhus broke ont. The only hospital consisted of two Bedouin tents within which the soil was dug out, and which were partially filled with water. They were packed with sick. Until Captain Newcomb arrived, no. nlilk was&apos;provided for the sick. The sick were not allowed to be sent to the neighbouring village)till July, .1917, and then only because(Dr. Hauffe required the tents for the purpose of covering his stablest In January, 1917, the Arab doctor was : attacked by typhus, and in March.the contractors, realizing their own interest, began to effect some improvements with the assis-tanceof-Captain NewcdmbV Fifty men&apos; died between December and April,:, 1917. In June, &apos;1917, a new engineer arrived, who was very good to. the prisoners in.hik section.5 He was a luxembourg -burger. named BastehdornV    Captain Newcomb expresses his
surprise that any of the prisoners survived, and his opinion that Dr. Leutveg, residing in Aleppo, and Herr Foelner were mainly responsible for what occurred. L./Corpl. A. Goode states that he and 20 other prisoners were publicly flogged at this place.Captain Puri states that there were six German engineers on these sections, viz., Dr. Hauffe, Herr Schmidt, Herr Foegel, Herr Pappenberg, Herr Ehrler and Herr Niegebauer. All but Dr. Hauffe are said to have beaten the prisoners constantly. None of the engineers would assist in any way in ameliorating the lot of the prisoners.In 1918 conditions in these camps seem to have improved. (Sergt. E. Peacock).Available Witnesses with reference to the Hindu Camps:Lieut.-Col. J. Hennessey, R.A.M.C.Major S. G. S. Haughton, I.M.S.Captain J. S. S. Martin, I.M.S.Lieut. G.

They consisted of Bagtche, Islahir, Yarbashi, Cherer Dere and Airan. Bagtche has been dealt with separately as an exceptionally bad case.At Yarbashi or Yarabashi the German engineer was Herr Sebold or Zeebold. In July, 1916, there seem to have been some 320 British prisoners working on about 5 kilometres of road. Very few had boots or blankets and all had very little clothing. Herr Sebold promised to provide what was necessary, but nothing came. What clothing the men had was in rags. They had to work 10 or 12 hours a day on scanty rations, and when unfit for such heavy labour. They lived in verminous huts. Flogging seems to have been prevalent. After a month very few were left to work. There was much sickness: but at first the hospital accommodation for 5,000 men in all consisted of bell tents capable of holding 40 men. Subsequently other bell tents were added. The patients in hospital complained of lack of food and medicine.    When
Herr Sebold discovered that only 50 out of 320 British were working lie insisted on inspecting the men before they went to hospital and sent several sick men to work. For some time if they did not do half a day&apos;s work they received no rations. Herr Sebold expressed the view that the contractors&apos; could not afford to have a lot of men in hospital drawing rations, and he seems to have been the man who said that &quot; though every British soldier had to die, he would have the line finished by August.&quot; In August 36 of the 320 died and 140 out of 320 died in three months. The contractors or Sebold then asked the Turks to remove the rest; and on the 5th of September, 1916, all who were fit to travel left Yarbashi. Sixty remained in hospital, and most of them died in September and October, 1916.The men worked about three miles from the hospital. The sick had to work, unless they walked three miles to the hospital. Several died in the huts, unable to walk to hospital and without any medical attention.The conditions apparently improved later; for Captain L. A. P. Anderson, I.M.S., who was at Yarbashi from October, 1916, to October, 1918, says that the treatment was on the whole good, that indiscriminate beating was not allowed and that men were only bastinadoed on the order of the engineer (Herr Sebold). The hospital was, however, filthy and insanitary until about January, 1917, when the conditions in the hospital were im-proved and became fairly satisfactory. (See too Conductor Quigley.)The Indians seem to have stood the hardships of this camp better than the British.Witnesses available:Major Rybot, 76 Punjabis.Captain L. A. P. Anderson, I.M.S.C.S.M.

bottles all seriously ill; most of them suffering from enteritis and unable to eat the bread ration. Twenty-two of them died. Ass. Surg. F. Aquino was told in confidence by the Armenian doctor that he had medical supplies but dared not give them. On the 11th July, 1916, A.S. Aquino left with 30 men, all sick, for Adana Hospital, a German officer having secured transport for them. They were two days on the journey, but were only provided with Turkish soldiers&apos; rations and had no medicines. At Adana Hospital they were well looked after. The conditions at Islahir improved after a complaint had been secretly con^-veyed to the American Consul at Aleppo and a representative of the Consul had visited the camp.Witnesses available:Lt.-Col.

Spooner, C.F., I.A.At Cherer Dere or Sheker Dera (near Marrnouri) the prisoners (who were nearly all Indians) were supplied with good tents : but the winter was very cold, with snow; and the prisoners were not allowed to light fires in the tents. Out of 250 men 30 died in 3 months of malaria and dysentery. At first rations were ample; in 1917 they were reduced, but the prisoners were able to supplement them by purchasing substitutes with money pro-vided by the American Consulate. In the first year there were no medical arrangements or drugs, e.g,, quinine. Afterwards conditions improved, as a hospital with 24 beds was built. The commandant and the German officers seem to have treated the men fairly well.Witnesses available :Sub. Asst. Surg. Barkat Ali, I.M.D. Conductor R. F. Cole, S. &amp; T., I.A.At Airan in 1916 there was a Swiss official who was kind to the prisoners on arrival, giving them a week&apos;s rest and ample rations. The accommodation was bad. As time went on the rations grew worse. Sickness increased; there were many deaths from stomachic troubles. The men were too weak to work, but if the men were too sick to work, they received no rations. The men seem to have been at this place for 8 months. By this time the percentage of deaths had become so high that the men tvere sent to various concentration camps. In connection with this camp there re-appears a story which is frequently told, of the hospitals of other camps. In the words of the witness, &quot; six men in a critical condition were given an injection in the arm; 20 minutes after all were carried out dead. Burial parties noticed that all the dead have had a similar puncture.&quot; Serjt. R. T. Heales, speaking of the period July to October, 1916,

Artill.Transport conditions in connection with the Amanus Camps.(a) The contractors appear to have found that working the sick prisoners at Yarbashti was unprofitable and so they returned them to the Turks. The men were collected at Marmouri station. There they were lying on the platform, some dead, others dying. Those who were alive were put into trucks (40 in each truck) and despatched to Afion Kara Hissar. When the train stopped at Adana, about one third of the men were taken out as too sick to travel any further. The train proceeded to Tarsus and there about 40 men were removed from the trucks dead. About 100 sick men were taken to Tarsus, and the rest marched through the Taurus Mountains to Bozanti where they entrained for Afion Kara Hissar.   Many died on this march.Witnesses available:C.S.M. Bough, 2nd R. W. Kents.Pte, E. Harris, l/10th Middlesex.   (Diary.)(6) The same reasons induced the Messrs. Clauss to get rid of the survivors of the British prisoners at Bagtche. At about the end of the first week in September, 1916, the men were dragged out of the hospital and driven by the Turks to the train, which left Bagtohe at about 2 a.m. on a cold wet night. The men were, for the most part, half naked, scarcely any possessed blankets or boots. Conductor Quigley describes their departure and the discovery by him next morning of some dead men, lying by the railway, who had been left behind. R.Q.M.S. Harvey describes the journey. All the prisoners, whether sick or whole, were bundled into small trucks, with only sufficient room for standing. When they reached railhead (about 2 miles from Marmouri) oufof 400 men on the train 30 were taken out dead and laid down by the line. The rest marched to the main line station at Marmouri and there entrained for Tarsus. At Tarsus the American Authorities intervened and an inspection was held, with the result that out of about 350 men 200 were sent to hospital. There they received the first food they had had since leaving Bagtche. After 3 days at Tarsus, they had to march 4 days across the mountains. Half way through the mountains they came to a motor depot whete it was arranged
that the sick were to be taken on by motor&apos; lorry. Those who could march proceeded. A few minutes after the sick had fallen out in accordance with the arrangement, they weie kicked up and compelled to march. On the 14th September they entrained at Bozanti for Afion Kara Hissar, 46 to the truck. At Konia 10 men were taken out dead and 6 extremely ill. At Afion most of the others were sent into hospital.Witnesses available : Conductor Quigley.R.Q.M.S. F. Harvey, 2nd Dorsets.   (Diary.)(c) In 1917 a number of British prisoners at Bagtche were found to be unfit for work. A party of 53 men was despatched to Bore Convalescent Camp in two open trucks. It was very hot and there was no water. One of the prisoners suffering from fever who tried to get some water was flogged by a Turkish Serjeant and then thrown on to the truck. When the party reached Adana this man was dead and was taken out of the truck. The party detrained at Ouli Kitschli at 3 a.m., 3 days after leaving Bagtche. They were at once compelled to march to Bore, although they were sick men exhausted by the journey and lack of food. If any one lagged behind on the march he was flogged. Thirty-six out of the 53 men reached Bore. Of these all but three had to go into hospital within 4 or 5 days after reaching Bore, and in the hospital most of them died.Witness:L/Corpl. Ashburner, K.O.S.B.(d) At an earlier date (in 1916) some of the Kut prisoners reached! Islahir after their terrible experiences on the march from Kut-el-Amara, many of them sick and exhausted. At Islahir the fit men were picked out and marched off. On the next day, at 4 p.m., the sick men suffering from dysentery and other complaints (except 8 men who had died of dysentery at Islahir), were marched from Islahir across the hills, through a forest fire, during the night, arriving at Marmouri at 4 p.m. the following day. The party consisted of 87 men, of whom only 40 reached Marmouri.Witnesses available :Gr. D. Carrington, R.G.A.Gr. S. J. Smith, 82 Batt., R.F.A.(e) When, owing to the high death-rate, the men were removed from Airan, they were marched from Tarsus over the mountains to Bozanti, some of the sick being brutally treated on the way. At Bozanti, 48 dysentery cases were put into one truck. By the morning one had died and most of the rest were in such a state that they &quot; had to be carried! out.&quot; On reaching Afion Kara Hissar many of them were taken to hospital wher* numbers of them died.Witness:Pte. F, Land, 2nd Norfolks, attached Army Corps Sig. Coy., 6th Div.
These are some instances of the manner in which sick prisoners, moving from one place to another, were treated by the Turks.Adana Hospital. It is said that a party of 46 British prisoners, &quot;who had been working behind the lines under the Germans,&quot; came in, and 44 of them died in the course of a few days from fever and dysentery. The same witness saw the bodies of several English soldiers lying outside the hospital, quite naked and absolute skeletons.Witness:Gr. John Fell, 86 H.B., R.G.A.At Gilebek (or Kilebek) there was a working camp in which there were some British and at one time about 1,000 Indians (Mahommedans). i The Turkish Commandants were Aziz Bey and Talaat Bey, both of whom, according to one of the witnesses, treated the British well. There was, however, a German en-gineer who had the practical control of the prisoners, Herr Gallus, of whose conduct all the witnesses complain. The prisoners were housed (1916-1918) in insanitary, verminous huts. Rations were insufficient in quantity and deficient in quality. If the doctor ordered a man to rest Herr Gallus reduced his rations by one-half. The men were flogged, and Herr Gallus seems to have beaten and kicked the Indians indiscriminately, sometimes using a shovel as his instrument of chastisement. The men were forced to work when sick, and Herr Gallus is said to have paid no attention to certificates of sickness given by the British Medical Officer (Captain Clifford). No clothing was ever received from the Turks, although in the winter months&apos; the weather was very cold. The men became ill and weak, and there was much diarrhoea and dysentery. Many British died, 15 dying in three weeks. Complaints are also made of the conduct of the German doctor, Wagnell, towards the sick in hospital in 1916. It is said that he beat British prisoners who were lying sick in bed with a twisted new hide thong, and boasted that he had killed more British in that hospital than any German soldier had killed! in the field. The same witness states that between 30 and 40 prisoners died in six months.from lack of proper treatment. Matters improved when Captain Clifford, I.M.S., arrived, as he secretly supplied the hospital sick with extra nourishment. But it is stated that when Dr. Wagnell found that milk was being supplied to the sick, an order was issued forbidding the villagers to sell milk to them. Apparently conditions were improved by.October, 1917, as one of the witnesses (Pte. H. Spoerer) says that,at that time the treatment was generally fair He refers to Ober-Leut. Weichs as the Officer in Charge of this camp. A witness reports that in the summer of 1918 there was no cruelty at Gilebek, but that the work was&apos; hard and; the food very poor, and there were &quot; millions of fleas &quot; ; but another adds that the water supply was bad and the huts overcrowded and verminous, that for some time the prisoners could not obtain clothes-or boots, that there was much sickness and&apos;that sick men^ were placed on half rations and sometimes the
day&apos;s rations were stopped altogether.: -He says that sOme men were flogged between March and August, 1918, for striking hi official.Witnesses available:Corpl. Cheeseman, 2nd Iloyal W.

This place is in a very malarial district. The Commandant was Mehmet Effendi, but the prisoners seem to have been under the control of the representa-tives of the German contractors. The men are said to have been forced to work when they were sick and quite unfit for work. The hospital was a small building with about six beds. The sick had to sleep two in a bed,. head to foot. There were no attendants during the night One sick man lay in bed beside a dead com-rade for six hours; another died in the latrine and remained there for several hours. The only doctor was an Armenian medical student and medicines were very scarce. One of the witnesses says;-&quot;Nearly everybody at this place was attending the hospital and it was a sight never to be forgotten, to see the
men lying round the building of a morning, waiting for attend-ance.&quot; After the arrival of Capt. Jones (127th Field Ambulance) in September, .1916, medical conditions improved, and in November, as none of the British were able to work, they were removed from this camp.Witnesses: ,Ldg. Tel. T. M. J. Parkhurst, Sub. E.7. E. R. A. Harrison, Sub. E.7.Task Dumas, a working camp in the Taurus Mountains. Here there was a working battalion of British, Turks, Russians, Roumanians, and Serbians under the charge of German Engineers. The British seem to have been well treated and allowed to purchase food from the Stores, while all the other prisoners had to eat the Turkish &quot; carawana,&quot; which was of very poor quality. The British also received money and food from the American, Dutch and Spanish Legations and also parcels from home. The Serbians were very weak and emaciated, and quite unfit for work. This was pointed out to the engineers without any result.Witness: ..Lieut.-Col. Bennett, R.A.M.C.Altchedik, a working camp in the Taurus. A complaint is made of bad treatment by Herr Winkler, a German engineer, but no particulars have been received.\ Witness:L.-Corpl. R. Compton, 1st Oxf. and Bucks L.I.At Bozanti some prisoners appear to have been kept in the open without any shelter for five or six days. Then they were allowed to sleep in a cattle yard among camels and horses, under con-tinuous rain. Several men became sick, and one died. Here they were forced to work on pain of receiving no food if they did not. This continued after the Armistice, up to the 7th November, 1918. This probably took place in the Karapunar working camp referred to by Sapper F. Wilson.Witnesses available:L.-Corpl. W. D. Broad, Berks Yeomanry. Sapper F. &quot;Wilson, W. Corps, Sig. R.E. Pte. C.

To this camp were sent from the working camps men who were past work. The commandant was Bimbashi Djevdid Bey. This man is described by Captain Murphy as having been exceptionally lenient and gentle to all British prisoners. One of the witnesses somewhat, grudgingly states he was &quot; the best, of a bad lot.&quot; The Rev. Harold Spooner says that he made a speech to the men before they left after the Armistice, and that tbe men cheered him &quot;as on the whole he had been good to
them, and never wished to see them ill-treated.&quot; The food was undoubtedly bad and insufficient, but seems to have been similar to the rations issued to the Turkish soldiers. There was a base hospital at Nigde, which was about 3  hours&apos; drive away; and there, Captain Murphy says, the sick were treated as well as the resources of the place would permit. The accommodation sup-plied to the British seems to have been decent, but the Indians were housed in a very unsuitable building. In September, 1918, Zeur (? Zia) Bey made an inspection, receiving individual com-plaints, and removed the prisoners from the last-mentioned buildings.The winter of 1917 seems to have been very severe. Many suffered from frostbite, and the Rev. Harold Spooner saw eight Indians (whose names he supplies) who had lost toes, feet or legs, and could only crawl about. One hundred died at Bore and Nigde; but this, on the evidence, was due not to bad treat-ment at Bore, but to the treatment which the men had received at the working camps. They were sent to the station at Oulakichla (30 miles from Bore) and, unfit as they were, were forced to march to Bore in any weather, often through snow two feet deep. No transport was provided. They were beaten along by the escort, and one was beaten to death on the way, while several died as the result of the march alone. For this Djevdid Bey was not responsible. Captain Murphy made many protests to him, and he in his turn protested unavailingly to higher autho-rity. But he could do nothing, as the prisoners were not in his charge until they reached Bore, and generally he knew nothing about them until they arrived. The action of these external authorities is illustrated by a story told by the Rev. Harold Spooner. On the 24th June, 1918, a Turkish Medical Officer arrived in order to select a working party for Belemedik. He made no examination, picking out 69 British and 30 Indians at sight. Captain Murphy was not asked to assist at this examination. These men had no money; many had no shirts or boots; most of them were quite unfit to march or work, and one had been on the list for exchange for eight months. They were &quot; pushed off &quot; at 3 a.m. On the 17th July, 50 of this party were returned as unfit for work, in a terrible condition.Witnesses available :Capt. L; Murphy, R.A.M.C. Revd.

Most of the Hindu officers were stationed at this place for some time; but as one of the witnesses says: &quot;I passed my time there all right,&quot; there was apparently nothing much to complain of; but Mr, Hoffman Philip states that in the summer
af 1918 the Governor treated a small contingent of prisonerswith great cruelty.Witnesses available:Subardar Dunga Rawat. Lance Naick Salakan Singh, 53rd Sikhs. Report of Suez Commission, p. 178. Mr. Hoffman Philip (if permitted by American Government).Afion Kara Hissar was a concentration camp at the junction of the railway line from Smyrna with the line from Constanti-nople.   This camp has been dealt with separately.Gedis, Gedos or Kedos was a prisoner-of-war camp for officers. It lies to the north of the line from Smyrna. There were some objections to this camp at first, but under a new commandant (in September, 19.17) there was noi ground for complaint. The officers were well-treated, mainly, we gather, because officers who had given their parole in exchange for a promise of good treatment (see under Enver, the case of the officers who were at Changri) were sent there.Witnesses available:Lieut.-Col.

In it were confined the officers and crews (72) of two ships which were in the port of Smyrna when war broke out, and two others of British nationality, and one of Russian 75 in all. They were placed in the Armenian school building, which was not large enough to accommodate this number of men. The sanitary arrangements were not very ,good. The food was that which was given to the Turkish sol-diers.. There was much sickness among the prisoners cholera, influenza, and spotted typhus. Nine died. The hospital arrange-ments were very inferior. The chief complaint on the part of the men was that they were treated as prisoners of war and not as civilians, and that, when they went out of the camp, they were always guarded by soldiers. The Governor-General, Rahmi Bey, protested to the authorities at Constantinople that they should be treated as civilians. There does not seem to be any serious ground for complaint against this camp.Witness:Revd. W.  H.  Brett,  British  Chaplain at Smyrna.John Cyrus Cousins, A.B., &quot; City of Chios.&quot;
Paradise Carrvp. This was a .camp near Smyrna, formed to receive prisoners awaiting repatriation. The conditions were fairly satisfactory. On the whole the prisoners were well treated by the Turkish authorities. In fact, the guards were punished for rudeness to prisoners.Witness:Revd. W.  H.  Brett,  British  Chaplain at Smyrna.Denizli. The prisoners at this place, which is on the Smyrna-Aidin Railway, were Indians. The Rev. W. H. Brett heard a very bad account of this camp; but the information which he received was by no means direct. From the Report of the Suez Commission (p. 176) it appears that the prisoners were treated like Turkish soldiers, that there was no active oppression in this camp and that, as one witness says, the prisoners were, on the whole, &quot; well-treated.&quot; On the other hand Lieut.-Colonel Baines states that in March, 1918, 600 Indians arrived at Broussa from Denizli, semi-starved, semi-clothed, and in the most miserable physical condition. This may, in part, have been the result of their treatment &quot; en route.&quot;Witnesses available:Report of Suez Commission, p. 176.Rev.  W.   H.   Brett,   British  Chaplain  atSmyrna. Lieut-Colonel Baines, I.M.S.Eskishehr. This place lies on the line to Constantinople, north of Afion Kara Hissar. Here there was a camp for Mohammedan officers of the Indian Army. For the first two months the officers were kept rigorously confined to their quarters. Some of the officers were imprisoned for 15 days and then sent to Afion Kara Hissar because they endeavoured to persuade their soldier servants to withdraw their application to be allowed to become Turks, which had been made on promises of land, cattle, money, and women. Otherwise, the prisoners were well-treated in this camp by Jelal Bey. They were taken to Constantinople to see the Sultan, who presented them with swords; and it is plain that the Turkish authorities desired to produce a favourable impression on the Mohammedan Indians.Witnesses available:Subardar Sher Khan, 67th Punjabis. Pte. Servant Mohomid Hussan. Report of Suez Commission, p. 179.Broussa. This was in the main a camp for British officers and Mahommedan prisoners of war. The Mahommedan prisoners were allowed to walk about freely and to work in the town. The prisoners in this camp seem to have been well-treated probably because they were Mahommedans. The cases of Broussa, Eski-shehr, Konia, and Gedos show that the Turkish authorities knew
how prisoners should be treated and were able, when they chose, to ensure that their treatment was satisfactory.Witnesses available:Lieut.-Colonel S. F. Newcomb, R.E. Pte. Servant Mohomid Hussan. Report of Suez Commission, p. 179.Adabazar. The Commandant, Tarsen Bey, is said to have been a &quot;very nice man,&quot; who&apos;did what he could for the prisoners. They clearly could not have been in a bad plight here, as the Commandant told his men to take an example of cleanliness and smartness from the British prisoners. One of the prisoners explains that as they were in the country, they stole geese, chickens, pumpkins, and anything they could lay their hands on, and that this accounted for their well-being. The Commandant saw that the prisoners had their Government money regularly every month.Witnesses available:A.B. A. Ashcroft, late H.M.A.Y. Ziuda. A.B. Herbert Blanchard.Ismidt, which is about 100 kilometres from the capital, is a contrast to Broussa and Adabazar. In October, 1916, a number of British prisoners were brought to this place. Mudir Sarif Bey seems to have been the Governor of the town. The municipal engineer was a German (name not given) who, accord-ing to some of the witnesses, had been a Prussian officer. The men were handed over to this German and had to work on a &quot; water bund.&quot; The men, when they arrived, were sick and suffering from dysentery and diarrhoea. They were badly housed and half-starved. Their medical requirements were in the main ignored. They were constantly beaten by the guards. When they protested that they were too ill to work and asked for a doctor, nothing was done, until on the 31st of October a Turkish M.O. admitted 34 of them into hospital, and excused 13 others from work. On the 2nd November ten others went to hospital. Then the German ordered the guard to make the men work with sticks. Typhus broke out. Men lay dead in the room occupied by the prisoners for three days.On one occasion they were kept penned in their room for ten or eleven days, on starvation rations, and with no sanitary arrange-ments of any kind. In this period eight of them are said to have died of starvation or sickness. This treatment seems to have been connected&apos; with the refusal of the men to consent to the retention by the German of  T.50 out of  T.200, sent for the prisoners by the American Embassy, which he insisted on deducting for rations or medicines; but ultimately he handed over the full amount. Then he cut down the rations to half a pound of bread a day per man and placed the men in quarantine when not actually engaged on work. This went on until the prisoners saw a Turkish Naval Officer passing and complained to him. On the 19th. November a new Commandant was appointed, and the treatment of the prisoners then improved.   Out of 100 men, 15
2021 Angora Camps.-These have been dealt with separately.are said to have died in five months. There are also complaints that boots and clothing sent by the American Embassy were stolen and that they received no pay for nine months.According to the Report of Messrs. Boissier and Yischer, in January, 1917, the Commandant, Lieut.-Col. Hamdi Bey, was &quot; bienveillant.&quot; There was, however, a great lack of blankets; 16 out of 89 men were down with sickness, and, since October, 1916, there had been 107 admissions to hospital.Witnesses available:Sergt.

In 1918 there were about 105 British prisoners who were lodged in a large house. The rooms are said to have been very dirty and verminous, and it is said that no sanitary conveniences were provided, and that for four months the men slept on the bare boards. According to the witnesses there was much sickness and very little was done to help the sick. No punishments were inflicte&quot;d as the men &quot; generally worked well.&quot; One of the witnesses says that the men were neglected but not ill-treated. Once a month the Dutch representative brought food parcels, and tins of compressed meat, and also syrup and soap. Whatever may have been the con-ditions in the early part of 1918, Messrs. Van Spongier and Menten reported that in August, 1918, the men (who were work-ing in a cement factory) enjoyed very good conditions, owing to the efforts of S.M. James Cross (Royal Gloucestershire Yeo-manry). The commandanfs name was Kerim Effendi. Witnesses available:E.R.A3 R. Milburn, Sub. E.14.P.O. R. A. Perkins, Sub. E.14.Sto.l W. E. Reid, Sub. E.14.Sig.

In July, 1916, 26 British and 4 French prisoners were sent to Sivas. They travelled for 2 days by train in a dirty cattle truck to Oukishla (the place where prisoners were inspected by Enver: , see Enver) and then started on a march/of 19 days to Sivas. They were compelled to march from daylight to dark and slept on the roadside. They received very small rations, and on some days had none at all. The guards drove them on, striking the sick with their rifle butts. As they passed through the villages, the inhabitants stoned them and spat. at them&apos;. At Sivas they were put into a small mud hut with some Russians and were kept there for 3 days. The rations were.bad, and the men had to work long hours without pay. Some, of the men who were too sick to work were flogged by the officer in charge. Six of the British were ultimately admitted to hospital and the rest were returned to Angora, This party of prisoners was inspected by Enver, who said that N.C.O&apos;s. would not do any work and that the men were to receive pay at the rate of 10 paras a day. No pay was in fact received, the men being told that it had been stopped for rations.Witness: / 1 ,  &apos;    ;&apos;: .Trooper A. M.

In. the summer of 1916, about 80, officers and their :orderlies were sent, ,tp; ,this place. They were confined in ,three small houses six weeks later the acconi-modation was. improved by the provision of another house.. For. 17 days they were not allowed out;except for the purpose of getting meals from a contractor. The contractor was allowed to charge the officers 50 per cent, above the prices which ruled in the town. For the first few months the bearing of the guards was offensive. One officer was struck by a sentry and several were hit with a cane by the Turkish Sergeant-Major. The Commandant, Kiazim Bey, refused to see the officers or help them in any\ way.    No camp furniture, was. provided,
Kiazim rarely visited the camp, hut he forced the shopkeeper! from whom the officers purchased supplies to give him bribes. All attempts to get him removed failed. After a visit by the Swiss Red Cross delegates conditions improved. When some officers escaped in August, 1918, the rest were strictly confined to their rooms. When Zia Bey arrived, conditions were im-proved; but when the Minister of War (Enver) heard of this, the restrictions were again imposed, and no walks were allowed until after the Armistice. According to Capt. Harris, Kiazim in 1918 was strict, but treated the prisoners in a reasonable way.Witnesses available:Lt.-Col. W. M. Pearson, I.M.S. Capt. Shakeshaft, 2 Norfolk.   (Diary.) Lieut.

The food contractor informed some of the prisoners that he had to pay the Commandant Tewfik Bey  1 per diem for the privilege of catering for them. The hospital accommodation in 1916 was very bad. Lieut. Reynolds, suffering from enteric fever, was left for fifteen days without medical attendance and was then removed in an unconscious condition to a Turkish hospital, where he died a day or two afterwards. Four officers escaped in August, 1917, and the Turkish Government directed the Commandant to stop all privileges and to confine the re-maining officers to their rooms day and night. The acting commandant, however, allowed them to exercise up and down a narrow dusty road for two hours daily. In October they were sent to Changri (see under Ewoer). Tewfik Bey also was accused of dishonesty and extortion and was removed after inquiry by Zia Bey. Before January, 1917, the treatment is said to have been indifferent. Then Fatteh Bey became Commandant and the treatment became &quot; extraordinarily good.&quot; He appears to have been succeeded by Cherif or Sherif Bey, who is warmly praised for his kindness. Capt. Mousley, however, complains that with the express permission of Fatteh Bey he wrote a book on International Law, and that when he was sent to Con-stantinople he was compelled to give up his manuscript to Sherif Bey, who promised to send it to the censor at Constantinople and that it would, in any case, be returned after the war. Sherif Bey, however, seems to, have torn up the manuscript, and when Oapt. Mousley asked for the return of it at Con-stantinople, Sherif appears to have denied all knowledge of the matter.Witnesses available:Lieut. C. H. McDermott, I.A. Reserve. Major T.

Daridja, near Constantinople.-At this place there was a cement factory. The Turkish officials seem to have been Djemal or Jemal Effendi and Khiama Khan. Prisoners were employed here in 1916, 1917 and 1918. The accommodation in 1917 was a room, about 50 feet by 30 feet, which 50 men occupied. There are complaints that in 1916 the men, sick or whole, were forced to work by sentries. Eor two days they had to work 18 hours a day unloading coal. For refusing to work more than 12 hours one was imprisoned at Constantinople for two months. One, who was suffering from rupture, was compelled to work, in spite of his request to be sent to a rest camp for a short time. In January, 1918, 50 British prisoners arrived at this place, and were set to work at quarrying stone for the cement factory. No food was issued by the Turks for the first three days. After that the men received wheat for breakfast, beans for tea, and a small loaf of bad black bread. They worked seven days a week on day shifts and night shifts.&apos; On changing shifts they had to work 16 hours. The sick were visited once a week. Complaints went unheeded. On the 5th November, 1918, 44 men were taken ill with Spanish influenza. The Turks made no adequate attempt to treat the sick men, of whom two died on the 8th and a third on the 11th November. Apparently the doctor was in need of medical supplies, as on the 8th Novem-ber he asked one of the prisoners if he could sell any medicines. There is a complaint that in 1918 the Commandant, who was in charge of the canteen, made the prisoners pay extortionate prices for any food which they bought. Meat cost 150 piastres for 2$ lbs., and the cost of other foods was on a similar scale.Messrs. van Spengler and Menten reported in August, 1918, that, in consequence of the Berne Convention, the Turkish Government had tried to improve conditions in this camp, and, in place of the former Commandant, had appointed Lieut-Col. Sjoukri Bey with Housny Bey as his assistant, with the result that improvements had begun; but they added that constant visits would be necessary, as all improvements had to be forced on the Turkish authorities by neutral Inspectors.Witnesses available:Gnr.

Enver Pasha&apos;s Farm at Chataldja.-Some of the British pri-soners were set to work here; they had long hours, no pay, but good food. The director of the farm, Miden Bey, did what he could for them. Enver visited the farm, listened to the pri-soners&apos; grievances, and promised to redress them; but nothing happened. Mr. Van Bommel, of the Dutch Legation, looked after the prisoners very well. It does not appear that there was much to complain of in this case.Witnesses available:R.S.M. S. H. Field, Staff, R.A.Q.M.S. Bough, 2nd R. W. Kents.San Stefano, near Constantinople. There are complaints against the Commandant, Major Bannerman (or Benemann), a German, who is said to have been a &quot; brute,&quot; and to have driven the prisoners hard, and done all that he could to make the pri-soners &quot; unhappy.&quot; Although the1 sea was only a few yards from the camp, the prisoners were not allowed to bathe in it in summer, but it appears from Mr. van Bommel&apos;s Report (Sept., 1918) that this was a temporary restriction imposed in con-sequence of breaches of regulations by some of the prisoners. The treatment here at first is said to have been rather hard; but after the first German Commandant&apos;s death, another German was appointed Commandant, and under him the treatment of the prisoners is said to have been good, many privileges being granted. Now it appears from the prisoners&apos; statements that the name of the first German Commandant was Major Garke, who committed suicide, and that he was succeeded by Major Benemann. It seems then that Major Benemann&apos;s treatment of the prisoners was, on the whole, satisfactory. From the Dutch Report of September, 1918, it appears that, although the accom-modation was insufficient and the camp was infested by vermin, the men, &quot;looked extremely well and healthy.&quot; The food supplied by the Turkish authorities at this time was totally insufficient,&quot; but it was supplemented from the supplies which the Dutch Legation had at its disposal.

In 1917, the conditions were bad. The food is said to have been scandalous. There was only a small ground for exercise. It is alleged that the men were robbed of the money which was sent by the British Government through the Dutch Legation. Parcels were held back, and the men are said to have been confined to their rooms (with latrines attached to the rooms), and not allowed out for four or five 209fi2 H2
months. Prisoners were beaten by the Turkish Commandant. There was much sickness. According to one witness the men on leaving were iobbed by the commandant of about  5 per man. This is probably the robbery above referred to. Capt. Mousley reported to one of the Embassies at Constantinople that the commandant who preceded Jelal Bey had stolen the men&apos;s pay for four months, and that many were dying, with the result that he was confined to one small room for several weeks.When the same captain secretly reported the Commandant/a action to Bach Pasha and several of the Embassies, he was kept locked up in a lobby, and had to pay extortionate prices to his guards for anything he got.In June, 1917, the officers were badly housed in very dirty quarters, with no facilities for washing. The Commandant, Jelal Bey, was as obstructive as possible. The officers were herded together and only allowed out on short collective walks. Some of them, were kept there for months (one for seven months) after being passed for exchange as unfit, and then were sent back to camp in Asia Minor. In May, 1918, one officer says that the * treatment was good; but in August, 1918, Lieut-Col. Baines says that the camp was most overcrowded and insanitary, and that drinking water was very scarce and very bad; and another says that the camp was filthy, insanitary, and verminous, and that 100 prisoners had to live in one room, but he also says that he has &quot; nothing of much importance to complain of.&quot; In July, 1918&apos;, Messrs. van Spengler and Menten reported that there were only six latrines for 200 men, and exercise and recreation were restricted, as the camp was in a crowded suburb of Con-stantinople.Witnesses available:Lieut.-Col.

They were not allowed to read any but religious books, or to walk about for six months.

In September, 1915, a considerable number of sick and wounded prisoners were placed in one large room, the windows were boarded up and they were laid on sacks stuffed with chaff, two sacks for every three or four men. Every two or three men had one blanket between them. The only dressing for wounds was iodine, and new bandages were very seldom supplied. Hospital clothing was issued once a week, and is said to have been always wet and lousy. From November. 1915, the Misses Vanderdoes cle Yillebois, of the Dutch Embassy, visited the hospital daily and brought food, clothing, bedding, and medical and surgical equipment, and conditions improved. This hospital was a barrack converted into a temporary hospital. The attention given to the sick was of the scantiest description. The surgical treatment was unskilful and dirty. The wounds became septic and there were many deaths. The sick were told that their treatment was a measure of reprisal. The latrine was next to the wards and the windows in the partition were broken,, so that the stench was&apos;unbearable. The men, though suffering from dysentery, were not allowed to go to the latrine except in parties of six under the charge of a sentry, the result being what might have been anticipated. The place was swarming with vermin, and during the month that Lieut. Fawkes was there no surgeon visited the wounded. An old Turkish physician prescribed for medical cases and referred the rest to the dresser. The result of the unskilled efforts of the dresser are described by Lieut. Fawkes. The dresser refused to attend to a man oftener than once in three days. The orderlies were vicious in their treatment. Anaesthetics were given to Turkish, but not to British, soldiers. The food was insufficient, and was stolen by orderlies. Before the American Charge d&apos;Affaires visited the hospital, incense was burnt to overpower the stench. This treat-ment appears to have been deliberately adopted as a reprisal, a representative of Enver Pasha having told the sick men so.Lieut. Stone gives a description of this hospital in August and September, 1915, having been sent there, though sick, on reprisal. His account corroborates the description given above. Medical attendance was practically non-existent. There was a total lack of everything and many of the men&apos;s wounds were maggotty. Enver Pasha himself visited the place. When a Turkish officer introduced Lieut. Stone and Captain Coxon, Enver deliberately turned his back on them. He only inspected the wounds of the slightly wounded. When Lieut. Stone tried to direct his attention to the cases where the wonnds were maggotty, ha
ignored him. Enver stated to a French officer in the presence of Lieut. Stone, that this treatment was a reprisal and that the sick need not hope for better treatment.Mr. Hoffman Philip states that in the spring of 1915 Suleiman Nouman Pasha gave the orders for the segregation of British Prisoners of War in this barrack hospital, where they were con-fined under most inhuman conditions, and that Seifi Bey refused all offers of assistance. He adds that the Military Commandant of this Hospital in the summer of 1915 was particularly brutal. The American Government states that a full report from Mr. Phillip will be available shortly. This will probably show who was the Military Commandant to whom he refers, and what are the specific acts of which Mr. Philip accuses him. In the, meantime the British authorities at Constantinople can, no doubt, ascertain his name and take steps for the purpose of securing his arrest.Witnesses available:Capt. C. R. M.

One hundred were placed in a room about 50 feet by 15 feet.   It was impossible to lie down.  They were kept
here for a month, and for three weeks were without furniture, bedding or exercise. When the American Ambassador came to see them, they were given some clothes; when he left, the clothes were taken away.Another batch of prisoners was confined in &quot;an awful under-ground prison, over-run with bugs and lice &quot; for 10 days in August, 1915. In April, 1916, some men were taken to &quot;a large prison and put into a very filthy room absolutely alive with lice.&quot; The guard would not let them go to the latrines &quot;except when they thought fit&quot; and were brutal to the prisoners. They were not allowed to communicate with their officers. Sig. Timbrell and some others were confined in 1918 in what he calls the &quot; Marcus Commandant Prison,&quot; for three weeks. For the first few days they had no food. They were in a filthy room amongst criminals. Cholera and other diseases broke out and he and five of his fellow prisoners, contracted diseases and were removed to hospital (Malteppe). Witnesses available:Sergt. E. Peacock, 4th Worcesters.Pte.

Brodie and 4 others and Major Todd, Major Cree, Mr. Dexter, and Mirza Ali (see Enver). It is described as very dirty. The prisoners received poor rations in insufficient quantity and they were kept in close confinement; In January, .1917, Captain F. H. C. Armstrong was removed from the Haidar Pasha Hospital to the prison and was placed in a filthy cell with a civilian murderer. He was confined to this cell for three weeks, except for three separate half-hours, when he was allowed out for exercise. His explanation of these facts is that when a prisoner was dis-charged from hospital he was sent to prison until he could be sent back to a camp, and the authorities forgot the Captain. But Zemal Bey, the Governor of the Prison, was responsible for the oversight and for placing him in such quarters and confining him in this way. Lieut. E. Granger in 1915 was placed in a dungeon in this prison for 8 days, and contracted blood-poison-ing from bug bites. Lieut. Branson was kept here in a small room for 28 days without medical attention, although he had an open wound,   Lieut. Mackae was kept in jail here for 24
- -   207days for no reason. In 1918, Lieut. Patton was placed in a small room with two spies &apos;and a Turkish criminal. The room was full of smells and verminous. He was kept here fourteen days without a bath. Then he was allowed a bath and was removed to another room where 3 other British officers were imprisoned. He received half a loaf a day for rations. Capt. P. Yeats Brown was kept in this prison in October, 1916, pend-ing an enquiry into the circumstances in which he had commu-communicated to the American Embassy some facts as to the treatment of the Kut prisoners; and again later he was confined here for five weeks as a punishment for an attempted escape.&quot;No description,&quot; he said, &quot;of the dirt, vermin and discomfort of this prison can be given in a few words; only in the dark ages could a counterpart of such a dungeon be found.&quot;In August, 1915, about a 100 British prisoners were placed in this prison in a room about 20 yards square. There was no bedding. They were terribly overcrowded and many of them suffered from dysentery; but the guards would not allow them to go to the latrine. In May, 1915, Lieut.-Commander H. J. Stoker was placed in this prison among all kinds of criminals. The place was filthy and verminous. In order to get a place in the w.c. he had to push to jostle with a crowd of criminals. In order to force information from him he was first placed in a room (20 feet by 8 feet) with four Turks and then in solitary confinement. This treatment is said to have been ordered by Kaimakan Djevad Bey.In October, 1915, he was again placed in this prison by order of Djevad Bey and his conditions were similar. He occupied a room 10 feet square which was almost completely dark. The room was full of bugs and abounded with rats. He received the rations of a Turkish soldier and was not allowed to buy extras. He remained there for 3  weeks and was only released on the repeated demand of the American Ambassador. Sub-Lieut. Geoffrey Fitzgerald, R.N.R., had a similar experience, Djevad Bey stated that in treating the two officers in this way, he was acting under the direct and specific orders of Enver Pasha.In April, 1916, after an attempt to escape from Afion Kara Hissar, he was again placed in this prison with Lieutenant-Commander Cochrane and Lieut. Price, R.N. Here they re-remained for 101 months although a Court-Martial which took 6 months to complete its sittings only sentenced one of them to 25 days&apos; imprisonment and the other two to 24 days each.Lieut. G. T. Bysshe had a five months&apos; experience of this prison.Witnesses available:Capt. F. H. C. Armstrong, 67th Punjabis. Pte. Carpenter, l/5th Batt. 4th Bde. Anzac. Lieut. E.

Miss Edith Johncock was matron of the British Hospital at Nazareth at the outbreak of the war and was detained as a prisoner by the Turks, She was at the Hospital for three years, and subsequently after the fall of Jerusalem was sent by the Turks to the Merkes Hospital at Damascus, where she worked for nearly a year. Her account of the conditions of these Hospitals shows that the treatment of the patients, other than officers, was very bad indeed. At Nazareth the food was totally inadequate and unsuitable for invalids. When milk diet was given it was only another name for starvation. The diet sheets did not represent the diet. The food given to the men in Damascus hospitals was much better than at Nazareth. The clothing was quite insufficient, and when patients left hospital they were often dressed in very dirty Turkish uniforms full of lice. The men&apos;s own blood-caked clothes were never washed unless Miss Johncock and the French Nuns did the work Ismail Bey was the Chief Inspector of the Nazareth Hospitals. Hussein Effendi, Fuad Effendi and Towfik Effendi at Nazareth, and Chikary Bey at Damascus were also responsible for the state of things. Anaesthetics, if used at all, were administered by incom-petent persons. Dr. Fuad Bey amputated a leg in Miss John-cock&apos;s presence when the man was conscious. The dressing of Wounds was in early days left to incompetent persons, but later the doctors were ordered to stay in the dressing rooms. There was a totally inadequate supply of drugs and dressings although it is said that at the central depots there was an ample supply of all medical necessities. These were deliberately withheld. At one time, British prisoners of war occupied 42 of the 80 or 90 beds on the top floor of the Nazareth Hospital. Miss John-cock was permitted to do the dressing of the wounds of the&apos; English prisoners, but with entirely inadequate materials. She states that she visited the central depots and saw stores of every kind. The prisoners of war arrived at these hospitals in a very bad&apos; state as the result of horrible neglect and terrible conditions of transport. (Miss Johncock, Private J. Beer.)

MEMORANDUM II. Shooting Incident at Langensalza Camp, November 27, 1918.The story of this incident may be summarised shortly as follows:  There had been some unrest among the prisoners and on November 26th, owing to an influx of prisoners from working camps, it was decided to dismantle the theatre built at the expense of the French in order to afford shelter for those coming in. The wood of the dressing room, etc., was carried out and the French, considering the wood to be their property, assembled in considerable numbers, and began carrying off the wood to make fires for cooking, for which no arrangements were ever made at this camp.The alarm was suddenly sounded, the guard rushed in and at point blank range fired into the crowd, with the result that some 15 were killed (including 3 British who were not in the crowd at all) and a number wounded. Rapid firing lasted about 5 minutes.The Spanish, and later the Dutch, representative proceeded to enquire into the matter. The following is the translation of the conclusion of the report of the Spanish representative. &quot; The above facts produce a most painful impression. It is no part of the duty of the delegates.to discover those who are to blame. But they can say that in the camp at Langensalza fire was directed upon defenceless prisoners without any previous warn-ing; that their attitude neither before nor after the occurrence afforded any justification for the attack. That when it occurred the sentries were inside the barbed wire which surrounded the place where the prisoners were, that it is altogether extraordinary that up to the present the sentries who fired have not been interro-gated and that they have not been put under arrest, although five days have elapsed since the occurrence.&quot;The German report does not in any substantial way dispute the accuracy of this statement. The question is who was respon-sible, a matter which the German report says it is not possible to determine.    In our opinion this is correct,Pte. Macgregor 43864 R,E. and Pte. Shepherd 3114 2/Gordon Highlanders, whose statements are in the file, say &quot; Captain Koch was in charge of the whole affair &quot; and the latter adds that he &quot; saw him come through the camp with a loaded revolver,&quot;Daridja), Herr Sebold (or Zeebold) at Yarbashi or Yarabashi), Rang Effendi and Ibrahim Eifendi and Herr Foegel (at Tel-hadi or Tel-el-Elaf), Nouri Bey and Herr Foelner (at Dierbieza), Djevad Bey and Djemal (or Zemal) Bey (Seraskierat Prison. Constantinople), Suleiman Nouman Pasha and the Military Commandant in the summer of 1915 of the Tash Kishla Hospital, Constantinople, and Herr Gallus (at Gilebek), the German Muni-cipal Officer (October, .19.16), at Ismidt, Cantain Fuad (or Fouard), Staff Officer Yussuf (Adjutant 32nd Suwan Ali), and other commanders of escorts on the marches between Kut-el-Amara and Ras-el-Ain should be brought to trial; while the conditions of the camps as a whole should be used in support of the second charge against Enver Pasha and the charges against Kemal Bey, von Bach Pasha and Lt.-Col. Rushdi Bey.
According to the Spanish report several prisoners support this, and others say that even if he did not give the order to- fire he did nothing to stop it: others place the blame on Feldweber Halle and others again on Feldwebel Walther. Lastly it appears that four British prisoners, Golding, Hampshire and Arney (rank, numbers and regiments not given) and Sergeant E. Adams, A.C.S.M. 7/Som. Lt. In., say that TJnter Offizier Krause gave the order to fire. Sergeant Adams bases his statement on the words of Corporals Renney and Golding; Tierney has not yet been examined. Golding has made a full statement, No. 296, p. 4097 of the printed evidence, and is very positive on the matter.The men have not yet been examined, including the above and those mentioned below. These should be examined by some per sons who have read the two Spanish, the German and the Dutch reports in order that they may direct special attention to the points in dispute, if it is decided to proceed further in the matter. But in my opinion it is hopeless to try to fix any one with criminal responsibility for this deplorable affair. There have now been held no fewer than three enquiries on the spot by the Germans, the Dutch and the Spanish representatives; and in addition a further enquiry at Berlin held by a German Corn-mission at which &quot; more than 100 declarations and attesta-tions made by the German Authorities and German soldiers as well as by prisoners of all nationalities including the wounded&quot; and others were read.All of them report that it cannot be established who gave the order to fire, though the sitting of the German Commission, according to the Spanish report of these proceedings, &quot;terminated by Germans accepting the responsibility for having violated the laws of nations on the 27th. November at Lagensalza.&quot; This conclusion is in my opinion supported by the evidence at our disposal which shows that even our witnesses are not agreed as to who gave the order to fire.It remains therefore to be considered whether the Commandant can be held criminally responsible for what is now admitted to be a wrong.   In our oponion he cannot for the following reasons.General Scholtz (the General of the Camp) and Captain Alexander, who seems ever since December, 1914, to have been the real authority in the camp, had been relieved of their duties at the time of the revolution. Rittmeister von Marschall, who suc-ceeded, was away unwell, and one Grase, the next in command, had gone to his lunch apparently leaving Koch in command for the moment. There is a suggestion by Golding that Koch was elected commandant by the Soldiers and Workmen&apos;s Council, but we do not find this supported by the other evidence.No one can read all the evidence without being satisfied that after the conclusion of the Armistice the discipline of the pri-soners fell to pieces, and the Germans seeing the prisoners pulling the place to pieces were quite justified in coming to the conclusion that they were faced by a possible if not probable outbreak.The revolution in Germany had destroyed the discipline Of the German guards and we have little doubt that what happened was that one of the guards got scared, fired his rifle and that shot
started the others and that it continued till someone seeing the effect managed to stop it.In our opinion, therefore, it being impossible to fix the respon-sibility for the first shot or order to fire, and it being apparently true that the superiors were not present in the camp let alone at the firing they cannot he held criminally responsible, and we suggest therefore, that no one should be scheduled in respect of this unfortunate incident.The case seems to us to be one for compensation especially as the German Commission has acknowledged that the shooting was not in fact justified.Names of the men who profess to be eye witnesses:   12963 Sergt.

M.I.6L.Sir, 29th January, 1919.With reference to your letter of the 22nd November, 1918, requesting that the War Office should furnish a report of vio-lations by the enemy of the laws of Land Warfare, other than those affecting prisoners of war, and subsequent correspondence, I am commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you that, in their opinion, a broad distinction should be drawn between offences committed by individuals in the field and those com-mitted in pursuance of a deliberate policy.It is of course true that numerous violations in the field were committed by members of the enemy forces, rendering the per-petrators liable to punishment.   It is, however, necessary to take
into consideration the fact that conditions in the field are abnormal, and it is unreasonable to judge the conduct of indi-viduals under such circumstances from the strict legal standpoint,In cases where the guilty parties fell into the hands of the British Military Authorities they were usually dealt with on the spot, and it is probable that of the remainder many were subse-quently killed. Moreover, perusal of the evidence shows that much of it refers to anonymous individuals, and is therefore incapable of securing convictions. Individual violations of the laws of war are inevitable in any army during the progress of actual hostilities, and to make charges against the enemy in respect of such individual acts is to invite counter charges from him. In these circumstances the Council would deprecate the formulation of any charge in regard to violations committed by individuals in the field.In any event the Council consider it necessary on grounds of policy to exclude much of the available evidence, such as that dealing with the question of illegal ammunition. Numerous instances of the use by the enemy of illegal ammunition have been reported, and in many cases the actual ammunition has been forwarded, and reports-have been made which furnish conclusive proof of its illegality. The question what ammunition is or is not legal has, however, been the subject of much controversy both in the past and during the war; it has been further complicated in the present war by the introduction for the first time in war of air warfare, and also by the fact that no rules for regulating that arm have yet been framed. The old forms of ammuni-tion soon proved inadequate to meet the needs of air warfare. Accordingly new forms, such as tracer, signalling and incendiary ammunition, were invented, and, although technically illegal, were employed both by the Allies and by the enemy. These new kinds of ammunition, although intended solely for use by air-craft against aircraft, could not in practice be confined to that object. It was found impracticable to prevent their use by air-craft against troops on the ground, with the natural result that troops on the ground in their turn employed them against aircraft and occasionally against infantry as well. Moreover, both before and during the war the Germans questioned the legality of the British small-arm and high-explosive ammunition, and it is con-sidered undesirable by the Council that these delicate questions should be re-opened.On the other hand, violations committed in pursuance of a deliberate policy stand, in the opinion of the Council, on an entirely different footing and are far more reprehensible. The principal violations of this kind committed by the enemy so far as land warfare is concerned were the ill-treatment of prisoners of war, the excesses in occupied territory, and the introduction of poison gas and liquid fire.Of these offences the Council understand that the ill-treatment of prisoners of war is being dealt with separately; while, as regards excesses in occupied territory, reports in regard to sys-tematic devastation and pillage committed by the Germans in-the course of their retreat from the occupied territory in the areas
-  210of France and Belgium reoccupied by the Brititsh Forces have been sent by Sir Douglas Haig direct to the French and Belgian Governments, as it was thought that the British Government were not affected.Both poison gas and liquid fire are clearly prohibited by The Hague Conventions and Declarations, and their use involved the infliction of acute and prolonged suffering. For the discharge of poison gas and liquid fire complicated machinery had to be devised and constructed and a suitable form of gas for use in shells and clouds had to be invented. From these facts it is clear that the Germans had premeditated their use long before these methods of warfare were actually employed. They did not hesitate to use them, as they knew that the Allies, having made no similar preparations, would be taken by surprise, and they hoped in this way to secure a material military advantage before the Allies could devise adequate protective measures. It was the usual practice of the Germans when they desired to adopt illegal measures to accuse the Allies of similar conduct; and accordingly they attempted to justify the use of poison gas by accusing the French of being the first to employ poison gas in shells, at the same time reviving the almost defunct controversy as to the legality of the use of lyddite in shells and renewing the old contention that all British high-explosive was illegal because it incidentally disseminated gas. Similarly they attempted to defend the use of liquid fire on the plea that it constituted a legitimate new invention of war. For reasons of self-defence the Allied Governments retaliated by themselves employing both poison gas and liquid fire, and ultimately they obtained a com-plete superiority, both offensive and defensive, over the Germans in regard to the use of gas. The Council, however, consider that the fact that the Allies themselves used poison gas and liquid fire by way of retaliation in no way affects the liability of the Germans to punishment for violating the laws of war by intro-ducing these weapons.On the 6th February, 1918, a note was addressed by the Inter-national Red Cross Committee to the belligerent Powers urging that the employment of poison gas should be abandoned. This note was considered by the Supreme War Council at Versailles, and a memorandum containing the official correspondence together with a note on the legal aspect of the use of poison gas prepared by the legal branch of the Military Intelligence Depart ment are attached for the information of your Committee.I am, Sir,Tour obedient Servant,J.

January, 1919.Geneve, 6 Fevrier, 1918.LE COMITE INTERNATIONAL DE LA CROIX ROUGE AUX BELLIGERANTS.Appel Contee L&apos;Emploi des Gaz Veneneux.L&apos;un des caracteres les plus douloureux de la guerre qui desole actuellement 1&apos;humanite, c&apos;est la violation journaliere des con-ventions les plus solennelles, de ce qu&apos;on a appele les lois de la guerre, de ces accords par lesquels on esperait en diminuer la cruante. Bien loin d&apos;attenuer les maux qu&apos;entraine la guerre, on peut dire que les progres de la science dans 1&apos;aeronauticjue, la balistique ou la cliimie n&apos;ont fait qu&apos;en aggraver les souffrances et sur tout les etendre a toute la population, en sorte que la guerre ne sera bientot plus qu&apos;une ceuvre de destruction generale et sans merci.Nous voudrions aujourd&apos;bui elever la voix centre une inno-vation barbare que la science tend a perfectionner, e&apos;est-a-dire a rendre toujours plus homicide et d&apos;une cruante plus raffinee. II s&apos;agit de 1&apos;emploi des gaz asphyziants et veneneux dont, parait-il, 1&apos;usage va aller en augmentant dans des proportions qu&apos;on ne soupgonnait pas jusqu&apos;iei..Le Reglement, adopte a La Haye, concernant les lois et cou-tumes de la guerre sur terre contient ce qui suit: &quot;II est notamment interdit d&apos;employer du poison ou des armes empoison-nees,&quot; et aussi &quot; d&apos;employer des armes, des projectiles ou des rnatieres propres a causer des maux superflus.&quot; Les gaz asphyxi-ants ou veneneux sont sans aucun doute l&apos;un de ces poisons inter-dits par la Convention. Les sanitaires qui ont releve sur le champ de bataille, les combattants atteints par ces gaz et mieux encore les infirmieres qui les ont soignes dans les hopitaux, tous sont unanimes a temoigner des souffrances terribles que causent ces gaz, souffrances diont la vue est plus poignante que celle des plus cruelles blessures.Cest deja trop que ces procedes soient entres dans la pratiquo de la guerre. Mais ce que nous tenons a declarer, c&apos;est que sur celui qui aura cherche a rendre plus cruelle cette methode de combat pesera une responsabilite qui va toujours en s&apos;aggravant, celle d&apos;avoir pousse la guerre dans une voie contraire aux idewi d&apos;humanite qui s&apos;emploient se repandre el done la Croix-Rouge paraissait la preuve vivante. Car il ne s&apos;agit, pas ici d&apos;un acte qu&apos;une armee puisse repousser parce qu&apos;il lui repugne. II y a de son existence meme. Un combattant, en face d&apos;un ennemi qui use de ces gaz, est force, malgre lui, de 1&apos;imiter, et s&apos;il ne veut pas etre dans une position d&apos;inferiorite qui pourrait lui etre fatale, il cherchera a le depasser, il concentrera tous ses
efforts pour obtenir que ces poisons aient une action toujours plus deletere, et plus eteudue: ce sera la rivalite dans la oourse aux procedes les plus meurtriers et les plus cruels.On nous parle maintenant de nouveaux toxiques volatils dont la fabrication en grande abondance est chose d&apos;autant plus facile que la matiere premiere de laquelle on les tire est tout a portee. On nous montre des projectiles charges de ces gaz ven&amp;ieux semant la mort et une mort affreuse, non seulement dans les rangs des combattants, mais a 1&apos;arriere, au milieu d&apos;une population inoffensive, dans une zone etendue ou tous les etres vivants seraient frappes de destruction. Nous protestons de toutes les forces de notre ame oontre cette maniere de faire la guerre, que nous ne pouvons appeler autrement que criminelle. Et si, ce qui est probable, 1&apos;adversaire est oblige de recourir a des moyens de contre-attaque ou a des represailles pour forcer son ennemi a renonger a cette pratique odieuse, nous entrevoyons une lutte qui depassera en ferocite oe que 1&apos;histoire a connu de plus barbare.Cest pourquoi nous Croix-Rouge, nous dont le drapeau est 1&apos;embleme du sentiment d&apos;humanite qui paraissait naguere se faire jour memo dans la bataille, nous nous adressons aux Soverains, aux Gouvernements et aux generaux d&apos;abord, puis aux peuples qui sont maintenant ranges les uns contre les autres. Nous faisons appel a ce meme sentiment d&apos;humanite qui nous ne croyons pas eteint memo apres trois ans de guerre.Voulez-vous que la victoire ne soit pour vous que la destruction complete de ceux qui vous combattent? Youlez-vous que la triomphe se change, en opprobre, parce qu&apos;il ne sera plus du a la valeur et a 1&apos;intrepidite de vos enfants? Youlez-vous, a son retour, saluer non le brave qui sans hesiter a exposer sa vie pour son pays, mais l&apos;homme qui, sans danger pour lui-meme, a reussi a 1&apos;aide de poisons a se debarrasser de ses ennemis, en infligeant a ses victimes d&apos;horribles souffranoes?Nous ne pouvons croire qiiJen tous pays les cceurs genereux ne soient pas revoltes par ces perspectives, et c&apos;est pourquoi nous n&apos;hesitons pas a demander hautement qu&apos;on renonce a cette maniere atroce de faire la guerre. Pour cela, il faut un accord immediat que les diverses armees s&apos;engageraient a executer loyalement. Si la Croix-Rouge Internationale pouvait provoquer cet accord, s&apos;il pouvait etre conclu a 1&apos;ombre de son drapeau, ce serait la un premier retour aux principes qui ont dicte les Con-ventions de Geneve et de La Haye, et cet acte qui sauverait des milliers de vies serait tout a 1&apos;honneur des nations aussi bien que des armees.Au nom du Comite International de la Croix-Rouge:Edotjaed Naville, president p.i.Adolphe d&apos;Espine, vice-president.Dr. F.

Legal Aspect op the Use op Poison Gas., The Declaration of St. Petersburg, 1868, with the object of rendering war more humane, forbids the employment of arms which uselessly aggravate the sufferings of disabled men or render their death inevitable. Germany was a party to this Declaration.At the 1899 Hague Conference it was proposed that the Con-tracting Powers should agree to abstain from the use of pro-jectiles which had for their object the diffusion of asphyxiating gases. This proposal was accepted by all the Powers represented of whom Germany was one, except the United States of America and Great Britain, and,1 was embodied in a Declaration. The United States declined to give their assent, and Great Britain, having expressed her willingness to agree only in the event of unanimity, voted with the United States against the provision.Captain Mahan, the United States delegate, gave the following reasons for his objection:  &quot;1. That no shell emitting such gases is as yet in prac-tical use or has undergone adequate experiment; conse-quently, a vote taken now would be taken in ignorance of the facts as to whether the results would be of a decisive character, or whether injury in excess of that necessary to attain the end of warfare, of immediately disabling the enemy, would be inflicted.&quot;2. That the reproach of cruelty and perfidy addressed against these supposed shells was equally uttered formerly against firearms and torpedoes, although each are now em-ployed without scruple. Until we know the effects of such asphyxiating shells, there was no saying whether they would be more or less merciful than missiles now permitted.&quot;3. That it was illogical and not demonstrably humane, to be tender about asphyxiating men with gas, when all were prepared to admit that it was allowable to blow the bottom out of an ironclad at midnight, throwing four or five hundred men into the sea to be choked by water, with scarcely the remotest chance of escape. If, and when, a shell emit-ting asphyxiating gases has been successfully produced, then, and not before, will men be able to vote intelligently on the subject.&quot;At the Hague Conference of 1907 the question of asphyxiating gas was raised again, but it was held that it could not be re-opened as the 1899 Declaration had been concluded for an indefi-nite period, and a year&apos;s notice was required before it could be denounced by any of the Contracting Parties. Consequently, as no such notice had been given it was still binding on them. Great Britain on this occasion announced her accession to the Declaration.Finally, the Hague Convention of 1907 lays down that belli-gerents have not got an unlimited right as to the choice of means of injuring the enemy; and, in addition to the prohibitions pro-vided by Special Conventions, it specifically forbids the employ-ment of poison or poisoned weapons. Germany is also a party to this Convention.
SECRET.121/1/466.19th March, 1918.The British Military Representative, Supreme War Council, Versailles.With reference to the Memorandum from the International Red Cross Committee inviting the belligerent countries to con-sent to abandon during the&apos; war the use of asphyxiating and poisonous gas, I forward for your information a Note expressing the views of the Army Council.(Signed)     F. Maurice, D.M.O., for C.I.G.S.Thus, by instituting in .1915 the employment in bombs, tubes, and shells gases composed of chlorine, formal vapour, nitrous vapour, sulphurous anhydrite and others, whose effect is not only to asphyxiate but also needlessly to aggravate the sufferings of those who inhaled them, Germany contravened not only the Hague Declaration of 1899 but also the St. Petersburg Declara-tion of 1868 and the Hague Convention of 1907.The Allies, taken by surprise by Germany&apos;s action, were placed under a considerable disadvantage militarily until they were able to take the necessary protective measures. They proceeded to manufacture a gas themselves and to employ it against the Germans and Austrians, as they were entitled to do by way of retaliation.In deciding whether or not to forego in the future the use of gas, various points have to be considered. For example, the Germans having commenced to use it the Allies may legiti-mately continue to employ it in the present war if they consider it advantageous to do so. It is likely that the proposal made by the Swiss Red Cross Committee to the belligerents to forego the use of poison gas may have been inspired by Germany and that it is an indication of inferiority on her part either as regards the potency of her gas vis-a-vis that of the Allies, or her inability to provide adequate protection against the gas employed by the Allies. It is probably impracticable precisely to define the kinds of gases which are to be prohibited, and the provision of a guarantee by Germany against their re-employment which would be acceptable to the Allies seems likely to prove an insuperable obstacle.The Swiss proposal is ostensibly based on humanitarian grounds: on these grounds the use of liquid fire, attacks on hospital ships and the bombardment of open towns are equally indefensible.121/1/466.  M.I.6L. 18th March, 1918.
* St* page 13 infra.On the 7th February, 1918, the International Red Cross Corn-mi ttee forwarded to His Majesty the King a Memorandum inyit-mg the belligerent countries to consent to abandon during the war the use of asphyxiating and particularly of poisonous gas.It was argued in the Memorandum that whereas the aim of The Hague Convention was to diminish, as far as possible, the sufferings of war, the progress of science in regard to aviation, ballistics and chemistry had served only to accentuate them and to extend the perils of war to the civil population. - The bar-barous weapons of asphyxiating and poisonous gas, introduced for the first time in the present war, seemed likely to be employed on an ever-increasing scale. The use of these gases was un-doubtedly prohibited by International Law, and the sufferings they inflict far exceeded those caused by the severest wounds. If one belligerent used poison gas, it was only natural that the other party should retaliate and should endeavour to produce a more destructive gas than his opponent. It was reported that a new gas had been invented which was far more deadly than any which had yet been used: this gas would spread death of an awful kind, not only among the troops in the trenches, but also behind the lines among the civil population.On these grounds the Red Cross Committee appealed to the belligerents to forgo a practice which, if pushed to extremes, would, they maintained, far exceed in barbarity anything known in the whole history of war.The French Government has now proposed that the terms of the reply to be sent to this appeal should be drafted at Versailles by the French and British representatives on the Supreme War Council with a view to being ultimately submitted to a general meeting of Allied representatives. His Majesty&apos;s Government have approved this proposal, and Mr. Cecil Hurst, C.B., K.C., Assistant Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, has been instructed to proceed to Versailles for the purpose of advising the British Military representatives. He has been informed of the views of the Army Council on this subject.The first occasion on which poison gas was employed in the present war was, according to the Councils information, in February, 1915, when the Germans used cloud gas on the Russian front and shells filled with chlorine against the Russians at Bullinoun, near Warsaw. Some time in the same month they threatened to use it on the Western Front, alleging that poison shells had been used1 against them by the French in Lorraine. Search is being made for the actual communique.* Two months later, namely, in April, 1915, the Germans used gas for the first time on the Western Front at the second battle of Ypres. The Allied troops, taken by surprise and without means of protection, were thereby placed under a considerable military disadvantage. By September, 1915, the Allies had manufactured a gas and were able to retaliate: they employed gas for the first time on the 25th of that month.The gas used by the Allies is similar to that used by the Germans, but the Allies use it in much larger quantities and are
far better protected than the Germans. The protection afforded by the German mask is limited by the amount of chemicals it can contain, whereas the British mask is elastic and can easily be adjusted to meet new forms of gas. If a new gas were made which penetrated the German mask, the Germans would have to re-equip their troops with a new issue of masks made on the pattern of the British mask. The British mask, unlike the German mask, is suspended from the neck, and involves the use of a considerable quantity of pliable rubber tubing which the Germans would find it difficult, if not impossible, to provide.Accordingly unless and until the Germans are able to replace their present mask with one made on the British pattern, they must necessarily be at a serious disadvantage. In fact, just as the Germans gained the lead in the manufacture of poison gas, so the Allies have always been superior to them in protective devices.The Germans reaped the benefits of surprise by launching poison gas against totally unprotected troops. Their action made it legitimate for the Allies to retaliate, and they in their turn are entitled to secure any advantage which is likely to accrue from the continuance of the use of gas.But even if it were desired to forgo its employment in the future, the Council consider that it would be impossible to arrive at a satisfactory definition of the gases to be prohibited. In this connection it is important to note that the Germans have always claimed that the British high-explosive shell is a gas-producing shell, and is therefore illegal. But although it is true that the British high-explosive shell, like all other high-explosive shells, on explosion disseminates gas, on the other hand, as its sole or main object is not the diffusion of gas, its use is perfectly legal.Finally the Council are of opinion that it would be impossible to obtain any adequate guarantee from the Germans that they would not employ gas again at some future date if the Allies now-agreed to renounce its use. The Germans could at any moment, if they chose, resume gas attacks, justifying their action by an alleged breach of the Allies&apos; guarantee, or they might contrive to manufacture a new form of gas falling outside the scope of the definition of prohibited gases. In any case the troops would have to carry gas masks in order to safeguard themselves against a surprise gas attack, and it would be necessary to maintain the supply of gas and of the machinery for discharging it in case the necessity for resuming its use should arise.There is some reason to believe that the proposal of the Swiss Red Cross Committee has been inspired by Germany, and that Germany is actuated by the fact that she has not only lost her superiority over the Allies, as regards the use of gas, but is likely herself to suffer greatly by its continued use.For the above reasons the Council are of opinion that it is inadvisable to accede to the proposal of the International Red Cross Committee, and that the British reply should be drafted in this sense.
SECRET.G.T. 4077.WAR CABINET.Asphyxiating Gases.A Conference of Military Representatives of the French, British, Italian American and Belgian Governments, accom-panied by Legal Advisers, met at 3 pan. on March 26th, 1918, at the Trianon Palace, Versailles, to consider what reply it might be desirable, from the military point of view, for the Allied Governments to send to the letter addressed to them by the Inter-national Red Cross Bureau in Switzerland with regard to the use of Asphyxiating Gases.M. Douchan Stephanovitch, Serbian Military Attache in Paris, and M. M. Novacovitch, Professor of Jurisprudence, had been invited to attend on behalf of the Serbian Government, but were unfortunately unable to be present.General Sir H. Rawlinson, the Chairman,, pointed out that the Conference had met to consider, from the purely military point of view, what recommendation it should make to the Allied Governments with regard to the answer to be sent to the letter from the International Red Cross Bureau. He gathered, but but was not quite certain, that a similar letter had been addressed to the enemy Powers as well as to those of the Entente. In any case it was not an official communication from the enemy, but had been raised by the Red Cross from humanitarian motives. The Representatives of the French arid British Governments, whose Armies were most directly concerned, and had had the widest experience in the matter of the use of gas in warfare, had already discussed the question and had agreed upon a draft of the reply which they suggested it would be desirable to send to the Red Cross. In that draft they had thought well to recite the conditions under which gas had been first employed on the Western Front, and to make clear that the Allies generally could not accept conditions which would bind 4heir actions in future unless they could secure really reliable guarantees that these conditions would also be kept on the other side,Captain Wright then read out the draft reply (attached S.W.C. 143).In answer to a question by General Bliss it was made clear that this was a draft reply suggested by the Military Repre-sentatives, and based on purely military considerations. It would, of course, be open to the Governments concerned to modify that reply or adopt a wholly different one.Signor Sicory pointed out that the draft reply did not go into any specific detail as to what guarantees could be secured, or what were the poisonous gases whose disuse was to be considered. He suggested that there were other instruments now being em-ployed in war, such as flame projectors, which were outside the category of what was permissible in The Hague Conventions.In answer to this, M. Fromageot pointed out that the original letter from the Red Cross only dealt with the question of gases.
The Military Representatives present adopted the following Resolution, to which the Portuguese Minister also gave his assent: -The Military Representatives of the. French, Belgian, British, Italian and American Governments are in agree-ment in recommending to their respective Governments to reply in the following terms to the appeal of the Red Cross Committee dealing with the question of Asphyxiating Gases (see attached).The Portuguese Minister, present at the meeting, gave his adhesion to this reply. /Versailles,March 26th, 1918.Use of Deadly Gases.Proposed answer of Allied Governments to Geneva Red Cross. Prepared by the Military Representatives at Versailles.. S.W.C. 143. The Military Representatives of the French, Belgian, British, Italian and American Governments are agreed in recommending to their respective Governments the following answer to the appeal of the Committee of the Red Cross con-cerning Asphyxiating Gases.The Portuguese Minister, present at the meeting, has signified his concurrence.Versailles, .   .March 26th, 1918.For French Representative,(Signed)     J. Pagezy.T. Lambert,Representative, Belgian Govern-ment.Rawlinson, Gen., ,British Military  Representative and Chairman of the Meeting.GlARDINO,Military Representative for Italy. Tasker M. Bliss,Permanent Military Representa-tive of the U.S.A. Bettencourt-Rodrigues ,Minister for Portugal.. The Governments of the Allied Powers, signatories of The Hague Convention, have received in a spirit of sincerest sym-pathy the appeal which the Committee of the Red Cross has addressed to them with the praiseworthy object of putting an end, if possible, to the use as a means of war of poisonous and asphyxiating gases.
More than any, the Allied Powers associate themselves with the generous and truly humane ideas which in this, as in other cases, inspire the Geneva Committee; they fully share the Com-mittee&apos;s sense of horror and sadness at the realisation that science, instead of being applied to the relief of human troubles, is daily prostituted to the pitiless work of increasing general destruction.It is only too true, as the Committee says, that those who first did not hesitate to invent such means of war as deadly gases assumed a fearful responsibility. Once such methods are intro-duced by one side, the adversary under pains of self-sacrifice cannot refrain from having recourse to them, and from seeking to s perfect his use of them, in order to gain and not suffer mastery.At the beginning of the present war the Allied Powers believed, and had the right to believe, with the whole world that barbarous methods of refined cruelty in war were done with as between civilised nations. Explicit and solemn pledges had been taken that no use should ever be made of poison or of arms, projectiles, or other means of war aiming at the infliction of needless suffer-ing. With the Committee of the Red Cross, the Allied Powers consider that poisonous and asphyxiating gases are clearly included in this prohibition.This pledge figured in the Convention of which various Govern-ments notably the Imperial German Government guaranteed loyal execution. If any value was to be attached to the word of honour of Sovereign&apos; States, no conviction seemed better established than that of the Allied Powers that their troops would not be subjected to the tortures of deadly gas and need not be furnished with any equipment to protect them against it.This was the situation when in April, 1915, the Allied Forces were assailed by a new enemy in the shape of deadly gases, first asphyxiating, then poisonous. The appalling sufferings caused by this insidious and treacherous attack have been only too accurately described by the Committee. The German Empire had recourse to methods it had expressly undertaken not to use, and had again broken its word.For months it became the diity of the Allied Powers to seek and to discover means of protecting their troops against these dastardly abominations and to furnish them with the power of resisting their adversaries with equal arms. This task is now accomplished.In its eloquent appeal the Committee pleads for an agreement to be undertaken immediately and loyally upheld by the Armies to stop the use of these gases.With any other adversary, had such a question been possible, the Allied Powers would not hesitate to give their agreement without reservation. They agreed in 1899 and in 1907 and are ready to pledge themselves with anyone whose word is kept.But in dealing with the German Empire and its subordinates, what guarantee could the Allied Powers have that this new agree-ment would be better kept than its predecessors? Could the new agreement be more explicit and solemn than the previous one, cheerfully betrayed by the German Empire, as soon as it con-sidered betrayal expedient?
In spite of all, if the German Government to-day declares that it adheres to the Committee&apos;s proposal, and offers detailed and&apos; effective guarantees that an agreement to discontinue the use of gas will he observed, the Allied Governments will not refuse to examine its proposals in the most liberal spirit. But without such guarantees the Allied Governments would fail in their duty in not having recourse to every means of depriving their oppo-nents of their power to harm.SECRET.121/1/466.22nd March, 1918.The British Military Representative, Supreme War Council, Versailles.With reference to my note forwarded to you on the 19th March, 19.18, regarding the invitation of the International Red Cross Committee to the &quot;belligerent countries to consent to abandon during the war the use of asphyxiating and poison gas, I enclose a copy of the German communique mentioned on page 2 of the Note.(Signed)  George Cockerill, B.G., for O.I.G.S.SECRET.

March 29th, 1918.Sir,I have the honour to transmit herewith (enclosure 1) the answer adopted by the Military Representatives of the Allied Governments at Versailles to the appeal made by the Inter-national Committee of the Red Cross to all belligerents to dis-continue the use of poison gas.v The procedure outlined1 in Lord Bertie&apos;s telegram No. 374 of March 12th has in the main been followed. The terms of the answer were settled at two meetings on Monday, March 25th, between the British and French authorities, but agreement between them was not reached without difficulty. A paper con-taining the views of the French General Staff on the situation forms enclosure 2 to this Report. From it you will realise that the French would prefer to abandon the use of gas if there was any reasonable security that an agreement on the subject would be observed by the enemy. The dominant consideration with them is the question of the supply of mustard oil (yperite). The enemy are a long way ahead as to this material: the French production is negligible; no large British supplies will be avail-able for some months; and the French are doubtful whether the British programme will materialise and still more dubious&apos; as to the American. So long, therefore, as there was security that an agreement would be observed, and so long as the agreement preserved their liberty to continue the study of gas problems and to equip their soldiers with masks, etc., as a protection against surprise, the French would have preferred to make a favourable reply tothe Red Cross appeal. ,
The attitude of the British experts was quite different: they were confident that our supplies of mustard oil would rapidly increase until they outstripped the enemy; that the Allied gas masks were distinctly better than the German; that new dis-coveries on our side might render the whole of the existing supplies of German gas masks useless and that they had no rubber available to manufacture a better pattern; that liberty to continue the study of the gas problem and to carry the equipment would be valueless because, in fact, if there was an agreement the Governments would not spend money on developing or making gas, nor would the soldiers be trained to the use of the mask he would throw it away as a useless burden and that no guarantees could be found for the due observance of an agreement. In fact, their attitude was that an agreement would merely give the enemy another opportunity of repeating the success which he achieved at Ypres in April, 1915.The first text of the reply to the appeal was prepared by Monsieur Fremageot and myself before the first meeting between the British and French Representatives. It was, in fact, a French version of a Note I drafted in English, and was in an alternative form one providing for an unfavourable and one for a favourable reply to the Red Cross. After that meeting, when it looked as if a deadlock&quot;would be reached, a compromise was arrived at which satisfied and was accepted by both parties. It leaves the hands of the British perfectly free, though it under-takes politely to consider any German offer which is accompanied by real guarantees for the observance of an agreement if one is arrived at.At the meeting on Tuesday, March 26th, of the British, French, Italian, American, Belgian and Portuguese Representa-tives, the text was submitted for their approval and was accepted. A covering Note was signed by the Military Representatives and by the Portuguese Minister, who was present in person, recom-mending their Governments to reply to the appeal in the terms of the Note submitted.Every cure was taken in the preparation of the draft answer to ensure that its terms should afford no handle to the enemy for propaganda purposes.The Military Authorities hold strongly to the belief that this appeal by the Red Cross was prompted by the Germans, but no conclusive evidence is forthcoming, and various circumstances  such as the article in the No^ddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung of February 25 (see Sir W. Townley&apos;s telegram No. 858 of February 27th), the rigorous prohibition at present by the German censors of, any mention either of the appeal or of the subject in the German newspapers, and the admitted inferiority at present in the Allied supplies of mustard oil seem to point in the other direction. It would, I suppose, be admitted on all sides that Germany would not scheme for an agreement on the subject unless she thought she would gain by the agreement when made.I am, Sir, etc.,(Signed)  C. ,T.

Enclosure I.Les representants militaires des Gouvernements francais, beige, anglais, italien et americain sent d&apos;accord pour recommander a. . leurs gouvernements respectifs de reponclre dans les iermes ci-joitit a l&apos;appel  du Comite  du Croix-Rouge concernant les  gaz asphyxiants.Le Ministre du Portugal, present a la reunion, a donne son adhesion a cette reponse,Frangais Pagazy. ,Beige Lambert.Anglais H. Rawlinson.Italien Giardino.Americain G. Bliss.      -Portugal M. Bettencourt-Rodrigtjes.Les &quot;Gouvernements des Puissances Allieea, signataires des Conventions de La Haye, ont regu avec la plus sincere sympathie l&apos;appel que le Comite de la Croix-Rouge a&apos;eu la louable pensee d&apos;adresser aux belligerants en vue d&apos;arreter, s&apos;il est possible, 1&apos;emploi des gas asphyxiants et empoisonnes comma moyens de guerre.Les Puissances Alliees, pluc que personne, s&apos;associent aux idees genereuses et vraiment humaines qui, ici encore, ont inspire le Comite de Geneve et elles partagent pleinement son sentiment d&apos;horreur et de profonde tristesse lorsqu&apos;elles constatent avec lui que la science, au lieu d&apos;etre appliquee au soulagement des miseres humaines, est prostituee chaque jour davantage en une ceuvre de destruction generale et impitoyable. .II n&apos;est que trop vrai, comme le dit le Comite de la Croix-Rouge, que oeux qui, les premiers, n&apos;ont pas craint d&apos;inventer dies moyens de guerre tels q\ie les gaz mortels ont assume une terrible responsabilite. De semblables procedes, une fois intro-duits, il est impossible a 1&apos;adiversaire de ne pas y recourir s&apos;il ne veut etre sacrifie, et de ne pas rechercher a s&apos;y perfectionner lui-meme et a y dominer s&apos;il ne veut etre domine.Au debut de la presente guerre, les Puissances Alliees croyaient et avaient le droit de croire avec le monde entier qu ll en etait dlefinitivement fini, entre Nations civilisees, avec les procedes de guerre de la barbaric et leur rafEnement de cruaute. L&apos;engagement expres et solennel avait ete pris par toutes les Puissances qu&apos;il ne serait jamais usage du poison, ni d?armes, ni de projectiles, ni de moyens de guerre quelconques destines a causer des souffranees inutiles. Comme le Comite de la Oroix-Rouge, les Puissances Alliees considlerent que les gaz empoisonnes et asphyxiants tombent directement sous cette interdiction.Cet engagement a pris place dans des conventions dont les divers Gouvernements et en premier lieu le Gouvernement Imperial Allemand-avaient garanti la loyale execution. Si la parole d&apos;honneur des Stats souverains se doit voir reconnaitre quelque valeur, rien n&apos;apparaissait plus solidement fondee que la conviction des Nations Alliees que leurs soldats n&apos;auraient pas a se voir infliger les tortures des gaz mortels et qu&apos;elles n&apos;avaient pas a les munir d&apos;appareils pour les en proteger.
Telle etait la situation lorsqu&apos;en avril, 1915, les troupes Alliees se sont vues attaquees par un mouvelle ennemi, les gaz rnortels: gaz asphyxiants, puis gaz empoisonnes ennemi perfide, im-palpable, cruel, causant les souffrances affreuses que le Comite de la Oroix-Rouge n&apos;a que trop exactement decrites. L&apos;Empire Allemand avait recouru a des procedes dont il s&apos;etait engage a ne pas se servir. Une fois de plus, il avait viole sa parole. , Pendant des mois ce fut le devoir des Puissances Alliees de chercher et de trouver les moyens de proteger leurs soldats contre de semhlables abominations et de les munir de tous les engius leur permettant de combattre a armes egales contre leur adver-saire.   Aujourd&apos;hui oette tache est accomplie.Par son eloquent et genereux appel, le Comite de la Croix-Rouge supplie qu&apos;une entente, que les Armees s&apos;engageraient a observer loyalement, intervienne immediatement pour arreter 1&apos;usage de ces gaz.Avec tout autre adversaire, si la question eut pu se poser les Puissances Alliees n&apos;hesiteraient pas a adherer sans reserve a une semblable proposition.   Ils 1&apos;ont agreee en 1899 et en 1907 ils sont prets a 1&apos;agreer vis-a-vis de quiconque tient sa parole.Mais, vis-a-vis de 1&apos;Empire Allemand et de ses subordonnes, si cette entente intervenait, quelle garantie les Puissances Alliees auraient-elles que le nouvel engagement serait mieux observe que le precedent? Get engagement pourrait il etre phis formel, plus solennel, aurait-il plus de valeur, que celui deja si formelle-ment et si solennellement pris par 1&apos;Empire Allemand et dont il s&apos;est joue, des qu&apos;il a cru y trouver son avantage?Malgre tout, si la Gouvernement Allemand declare aujourd&apos;hui qu&apos;il se raillie a la proposition de la Croix-Rouge relative a la cessation de 1&apos;emploi des gaz et offre des garanties detaiilees et efficaces assurant du&apos;un accord a cet egard sera observe par lui, les Gouvernements Alliees ne se refuseront pas a examiner cette proposition dans Pesprit les plus liberal. Mais en 1&apos;absence de semblance garanties les Gouvernements Allies manqueraient a leur devoir en ne recourant pas a tous les moyens qui leur paraitront propres a mettre leur adversaire hors d&apos;etat de.nuire.Enclosure 2.Note concernant une Proposition tendant a Abandonner i&apos;emploi de Gaz de Combat.I.

Cest pour repondre a cet emploi que nous avons mis en service (Note du 21 fevrier, 1915) des engins (grenades de 450&apos; gr. et cartouches de200 gr.), denommes a tort &quot; suffocants,&quot; puisqu&apos;aux termes memes de la Note susvisee ils renfermaient un liquide* qui, apres explosion, repandait dans 1&apos;air des vapeurs irritantes pour les yeux, le nez et la gorge. Ces engins etaient done exclusivement lacrymogen.es.En adoptant ces engins, le General Commandant-en-Chef, (Lettre no 1752 du 7 Janvier, .1915, au Ministre de la Guerre) avait d&apos;ailleurs bien soin de faire remarquer &quot; que les substances employees n&apos;exercaient aucun effet nocif grave, meme a des doses de beaucoup superieures; qu&apos;elles n&apos;etaient ni asphyxiantes ni deleteres, et que par consequent elles ne rentraient pas, employees seules, parmi celles visees dans la Declaration internationale de La Haye de 29 juillet, 1899.&quot;Telle etait la situation au moment de l&apos;attaque d&apos;Ypres par vague de chlore le 23 avril, 1915. tII. Les faits relates ci-dessus nous lettraient parfaitement a l&apos;aise vis-a-vis des Nations dont 1&apos;opinion nous interesse, pour decliner toute negociation ooncernant 1&apos;abandon de 1&apos;emploi des gaz de combat.Mais pour des raisons de haute convenance, il apparaitra sans doute que la France ne doit pas se refuser a examiner les con-ditions dans lesquelles les stipulations de la Declaration de La Haye pourraient etre reprises.Si nous sections ainsi amenes a renoncer a 1&apos;emploi des gaz, il semble, etant donne les precedents, qu&apos;il serait indispensable de nous premunir contre une nouvelle surprise que 1&apos;ennemi pour-rait nous reserver, car, avec les moyens d&apos;action actuels et 1&apos;experience acquise, une telle surprise pourrait avoir une im-portance capitale en ce qui ooncerne Tissue de la guerre.Les belligerants seront ainsi conduits a se reserver le droit de continuer les etudes concernant 1&apos;emploi des gaz ainsi que de preparer et de conserver tous moyens de defense et d&apos;attaque (fabrications et installations de toute nature).II ne faut pas se dissimuler que les reserves qui viennent d&apos;etre formulees, et auxquelles il ne nous parait pas possible de re-noncer, sont de nature a compliquer les negociations.JIII. Avant de renoncer a une arme dont nous avons le droit de faire usage, puicque l&apos;ennemi s&apos;en est servi le premier, nous avons, vis-a-vis de nous-memes, le devoir d&apos;examiner sa valeur.Au point de vue defensif, la mise en service du masque A.E.S., dont tous les combattants se trouveront dotes fin avril,g et la possibilite de poursuivre la fabrication de Pappareil TissotH nous assurent actuellement une superiorite incontestable.* Bromacetate d&apos;ethyle, chlorac^tone.f Cette attaque tres importante a certaiuement exig^ une longue preparation.X CeB reserves feront d&apos;ailleur8 perdre aux Allemands 1&apos;avantage qn&apos;ils trouveraient a ne pas voir se d^velopper certaines fabrications cbimiquea chez les Allies, en particulier aux Etats-TJnis.5 1.250,000 fahriques.  Rendement journalier, environ 20,000.I 180,000 en service.  Rendement journalier, environ 1300.
Etant dbnnees les difficultes de fabrication de 1&apos;A.R.S. (eri particulier de la soupape en caoutchouc) on peut adniettre que Pennemi aura besoin de plusieurs mois pour realiser un appareil de memo valeur.II y a lieu d&apos;ajouter que 1&apos;appareil en service dans les Armees Britannique et Americaine, dont la production est tres elevee,* est egalement nettement superieur a 1&apos;appareil allemand.Au point de vue de 1&apos;attaqiie, la question ne peut etre traitee sans tenir oompte de la production totale d&apos;obus et de poudre, c&apos;est-a-dire de &quot; coupe complete &quot; toxiques et autres.fCe qui importe, en effet, c&apos;est moins de connaitre nos res-sources en produits toxiques que de savoir si la proportion d&apos;obus que ces ressources permettent de charger correspond aux besoins tactiques.Les points suivants sont a retenir:(a) On ad&apos;met en general qu&apos;etant donnees les conditions d&apos;emploi des obus toxiques, il convient de s&apos;en tenir, pour 1&apos;Artillerie lourde, a une proportion de 1/7 ou 1 /8.$Mais dans cette proportion il semble qu&apos;il ne doit pas etre fait etat des obus charges en yperite dont les effets dependent beau-coup moins de l&apos;etat atmospherique et dont on peut prevoir un large emploi.Abstraction faite de 1&apos;yperite, qui dvailleurs est actuellement fabriquee en quantise insignifiante, les ressources dont nous dis-posons en ce moment permittent de charger en toxiques 1/7 environ de la production d&apos;obus lourds. En ce qui concerne le 75, nous chargeons environs 1/15&apos; de la production totale. I , On peut done estimer que la situation est satisfaisante en ce moment, en ce qui concerne les produits autres que Vyperite.(b) La situation ne deviendra reellement,.bonne que dans quelques mois, lorsque les Etats-TJnis nous apporteront le concours qu&apos;ils prevoient; abstraction_faite.de 1&apos;yperite, la realisation de leur programme, augmentera d&apos;au moins 50&apos; pour cent les res-sources prevues par les programmes frangais et anglais, et per-mettra soit d&apos;augmenter la proportion d&apos;obus toxiques des Artille-ries Alliees, soit de conserver une proportion satisfaisante d&apos;obus toxiques en cas d1&apos;augmentation de la production totale.(c) En oe qui ooncerne 1&apos;yperite, nos ennemis ont actuellement et conserveront pendant quelques mois une avance importante. On ne saurait meconnaitre les avantages que leur procure cette avance.Non seulement les effets de 1&apos;yperite dependent moins des con-ditions atmospheriques, mais en outre ce produit, qui infecte avec persistance le sol et le materiel, oblige a des mesures de pre-caution et de disinfection tres difficiles a realiser. L&apos;yperite est done particulierement efficace pour obtenir des effets de neutra-lisation.* 100,000 au moins par jour pour Angleterre seule.f Nous n&apos;avons d&apos;aJ leurs pas a examiner si cette production totale qui depend d autres elements (acier nitrateB, &amp;c.) correspond aux besoing.% Oette proportion paratt Stre admise ^galement par les Allemands, du moins avant 1&apos;emploi de l&apos;yp6rite.5 Les mSmes proportion! d&apos;obus toxiques se retrouvent dans 1&apos;ensemble des approvisionnements,

II est etabli que les Allemands ont les premiers fait usage des gaz asphyxiants interdits par la Declaration de La Haye.2. Au cas ou pour de raisons de haute convenance, nous serions amenes a examiner les conditions dans lesquelles il y aurait lieu de revenir aux stipulations de ladite Declaration, il serait indis-pensable de reserver la droit de pour suivre les etudes concernant les gaz, ainsi que die preparer et conserver pour moyens de defense et d&apos;attaque.3. Notre situation est actuellement satisfaisante a tous les points de vue, sauf en ce qui conoerne 1&apos;yperite. Elle s&apos;ame-liorera sensiblement dans quelques mois, et nous disposerons alors d&apos;une quantite d&apos;yperite qui vraisemblablement nous permettra de regagner 1&apos;avance que 1&apos;ennemi possede actuellement.Neanmoins, en balangant tous les elements de la question il ne semble pas qu&apos;on soit en droit d&apos;escompter une superiorite reelle sur l&apos;ennemi.Dans ces conditions le retour a l&apos;observation des stipulations de la Declaration de La Haye, sous reserves formulees, au para. 2 ei-dessus, peut etre envisage sans arriere-pensee au point de vue strictement militaire.Le General FETTER,Charge de Missions au G.Q.G.Le 15&apos; mars, 1918. j

(y)Use of Deadly Gases.Proposed answer of Allied Governments to Geneva Red Crofa, prepared by the Military Representatives at Versailles.(S.W.C.   143.)Trie Government of the Allied Powers, signatories of The Hague Convention, have received in a spirit of sinoerest sympathy the  appeal which the Committee of the Red Cross has addressed to them with the praiseworthy object of putting an end!, if pos-sible, to the use, as a means of war, of poisonous and asphyxiating gases.More than any, the Allied Powers associate themselves with the generous and truly humane ideas which in this as in other cases inspire the Geneva Committee : they fully share the Committee&apos;a sense of horror and sadness at the realisation that science, instead of being applied to the relief of human troubles, is daily prosti-tuted to the pitiless work of increasing general destruction.It is only too true, as the Committee says, that those who first did&apos; not hesitate to invent such means of war as deadly gases assumed a fearful responsibility. Once such methods are intro-duced by one side, the adversary under pains of self-sacrifice . cannot refrain from having recourse to them, and from seeking to so perfect his use of them, in order to gain and not suffer mastery.At the beginning of the present war the Allied Powjers believed and had the right to believe with the whole world that barbarous methods of refined cruelty in war wiere done with as between civilised nations. Explicit and solemn pledges had been taken that no use would ever be made of poison or of arms, projectiles or other means of war aiming at the infliction of needless suffer-ing. With the Committee of the Rfed Cross, the Allied Powers consider that poisonous and asphyxiating gases are clearly in-cluded in this prohibition.The pledges figured in the Convention, of which various Governments notably thie Imperial German Government  guaranteed loyal execution. If any value was to be attached to the word! of honour of Sovereign States, no conviction seemed bettfer established than that of the Allied Powers that their troops would not be subjected to the tortures of deadly gas and need not be furnished with any equipment to protect them against it.This was the situation when in April, 1915, the  Allied forces were assailed by a new enemy in the shape of deadly gases, first asphyxiating, then poisonous. The appalling sufferings caused by this insidious and treachferous attack have been only toe accurately described by the Committee. The German Empire had recourse to methods it had expressly undertaken not to us)e and had   again broken its word.For months it became the duty of the Allied Powers to seek and to discover niieans of protecting their troops against these das-tardly abominations and to furnish them with the power of re-sisting their adversaries with equal arms. This task is now accomplished.
In its eloquent appeal the Committee pleads for an agreement to be undertaken immediately and loyally upheld by the Armies to stop the use of th(ese gases.With any other adversary, had such a question been possible, the Allied Powers would not hesitate to give their agreemjent without reservation. They agreed in 1899 and in 1907, and are ready to pledg/e themselves with anyone whose word is kept.But in dealing with the German Empire and&apos; its subordinates what guarantee could the Allied Powers have that this new agree-ment would b)e better kept than its predecessors? Could the new agreement be more explicit and solemn than the previous one, cheerfully betrayed by the German Empire as soon as it con-sidlered betrayal expedient?In spite of all, if the German Government to-day declares that it adheres to the Committee&apos;s proposal and offers detailed and effectivfe guarantees that an agreement to discontinue the use of gas will be observed, the Allied Governments will not refuse to examine its proposals in the most liberal spirit. But without such guarantees thfe Allied Governments would fail in their duty in not having recourse to every means of depriving their oppo-nents of theiir power to harm.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. April 13th, 1918.122/1/466.33.Extracts from War Cabinet 392.  (16.4.18.)(9) With reference to War Cabinet 363, Minute 7, the War Cabinet had under consideration Papers G.T. 4077 and G.T. 4220, relative to the reply to the Geneva Red Cross Committee with regard to the use of asphyxiating gases, more particularly that portion which gave the proposed answer of the Allied Governments as drawn up by the Military Representatives at Versailles, such representatives comprising French, Belgian, British, Italian, American and Portuguese officials. Special reference was made to the clause which pointed out that, in deal-ing with the German Empire and its subordinates, no guarantee given by them would be likely to be kept, and that the possibility existed of the Germans being prepared to give a guarantee, with the result that we might cease our efforts in gas production only to find that the guarantee was broken and that we were again placed at a disadvantage in this respect. It was felt that, in asking for any guarantees in this matter, it should be clearly stated that such must be of an effective and unquestionable character.Subject to this addition, the War cabinet approved the proposed answer as prepared by the Military Representative at Versailles and requested the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform the Allied Governments and the British Minister at Berne accordingly.19,4.18.

121/1/466.Allied Reply to the International Geneva Red Cross Society.Les Gouvernements des Puissances alliees, signataires des Con-ventions de La Haye, out recu avec la plus sincere sympathie 1&apos;appel que le comite die la Croix-Rouge a eu la double pensee d&apos;adresser aux belligerants en vue d&apos;arreter, s&apos;il est possible, l&apos;emploi des gaz asphyxiants et empoisonnes comme moyens de guerre.Les Puissances alliees, plus quo personne, s&apos;associent aux idees genereuses et vraiement humaines qui, ici encore, ont inspire le Comite de Geneve et elles partagent pleinement son sentiment d&apos;horreur et de profonde tristesse lorsqu&apos;elles constatent avec lui que la science, au lieu d&apos;etre applique au soulagement des miserea humaines, est prostituee chaque jour davantage en une oeuvre de destruction generale et impitoyable.II n&apos;est que trop vrai, comme le dit la Comite de la Croix-Rouge, que ceux qui les premiers n&apos;ont pas craint d&apos;inventer des moyens de guerre tels que les gaz mortels ont assume une terrible . responsabilite. De semblables procedes une fois introduits, il est impossible a 1&apos;adversaire de ne pas y recourir s&apos;il ne veut etre sacrifie, et de na pas rechercher a s&apos;y perfectionner lui-meme et a y dominer s&apos;il ne veut etre domine.Au debut de la presente guerre, les Puissances Alliees croy-aient, et avaient le droit de croire, avec le monde entier qu&apos;il en etait defihitivement fini entre Nations civilisees avec les procedes de guerre de la barbaric et leur raffinement de cruaute. L&apos;en-gagement expres et solennel avait ete pris par toutes les Puis-sances qu&apos;il ne serait jamais fait usage du poison, ni d&apos;armes, ni de projectiles, ni de moyens de guerre quelconques, destines h causer des souffrances inutiles. Comme le Comite de la Croix-Rouge, les Puissances alliees considerent que les gaz empoisonnes et asphyxiants tombent directement sous cette interdiction. , Get engagement a pris place dans des conventions dont les divers Gouvernements et en premier lieu le Gouvernement im-. perial allemand avaient garanti la loyale execution. Si la parole d&apos;honneur des  tats souverains se doit voir reconnaitre quelque valeur, rien n&apos;apparaissait plus solidement fondee que la conviction des Nations alliees que leurs soldats n&apos;auraient pas a se voir inniger les tortures des gaz mortels et qu&apos;elles n&apos;avaient pas a les munir d&apos;appareils pour les en proteger.Telle etait la situation lorsqu&apos;en avril 1915 les troupes Alliees pe sent vues attaquees par un nouvel ennemi, les gaz mortels: gaz asphyxiants, puis gaz empoisonnes, ennemi perfide, impalpable^ cruel, causant les souffrances affreuses que le Comite de la Croix-Rouge n&apos;a que trop exactement decrites. L&apos;Empire allemand avait recouru a des procedes dont ils&apos;etait engage a ne pas se servir.   Une fois de plus, il avait viole sa parole.Pendant des mois, ce fut le devoir des Puissances alliees de chercher et de trouver les moyens de proteger leurs soldats oontre die semblables abominations et de les munir de tous les engins leur permettant de oombattre a armes egales oontre leur adver-saire. .Aujourd&apos;hui, cette tache est accomplie.
Par eon eloquent et genereux appel, le Comite de la Croix-Eouge supplie qu&apos;une entente, que les Armies s&apos;engageraient a observ/er loyalement, intervienne immediatement pour arreter 1&apos;usage de ces gaz.Aveo tout autre adversaire, si la question eut pu se poser, les Puissances alliees n&apos;hesiteraient pas a adherer sans reserve a une semblable proposition. Ils Pont :agree en 1899 et en 1907; ils sont prets a 1&apos;agreer visva-vis de quiconque tient sa parole.Mais vis-a-vis de 1&apos;Empire allemand et de ses subordonn^s, si cette entente intervenait, quelle garantie les Puissances Alliees auraient-elles que le nouvel engagement serait mieux observe que le precedent? Get engagement pourrait il etre plus formel, plus solennel, aurait-il plus de valeur que celui .deja si formellement et si solennellement pris par 1&apos; Empire allemand, et dont il s&apos;est joue, des qu&apos;il a era y trouver son avantage?Malgre tout, *si le Gnouvernement allemand declara aujourd^hui qu&apos;il se interalliees a la proposition die la CroixrEouge relative a la cessation de 1&apos;emploi des gaz et offre de nouvelles garanties de-taillees et efficaces assurant quJun accord a cet egard sera observe par lui, les Gouvernenaents Allies ne se refuseront pas a examiner cette proposition dans Pesprit le plus liberal. Mais en 1&apos;absence de semblables garanties les Gouvemements Allies manqueraient a leur devoir en ne reeourant pas a tous les moyens qui leur parai-tront propred a mettre leur adversaire hors d&apos;etat de nuire.9mai, 1918.MEMORANDUM IV. Liquid Fire.The first intimation of intention by the Germans to use liquid fire appeared from a Note, dated the 16th October, 1914, by the General Staff of i the German Second Army recommending the em-ployment of liquid fire. This Note was captured by the French, and was forwarded by them to the British Government in May, 1915, with an intimation that they did not intend to compromise the safety of French troops by remaining defenceless against such refinements of barbarity. In view of this information experiments with flame-throwing apparatus were commenced by the Trench Warfare Department of the Ministry of Muni-tions on the 1st June, 1915.Liquid fire was first used by the Germans against the British at Hooge during the might--of the 29th-30th July, 1915, though it is believed that it was used by the Germans against the French before this date: the first attack made with British liquid fire on the Germans was on the 1st July, 1916. Thus it is iolear that it was the Germans who were re-sponsible for the introduction of liquid fire,. From unofficial reports, they apparently attempted to (justify their action on the plea that liquid fire was a new and legitimate invention of war. The use of liquid fire is not, it is true, specifically prohibited by the Land Warfare Eegulations; but it is clearly covered by the Preamble to the 4th Hague Convention.  The Preamble
explains that it had not been found possible at the date of the Hague Conference to concert stipulations covering all the cir-cumstances that arise in practice. On the other hand, it was emphatic that the High Contracting Parties did not intend that unforeseen cases should, in.default of written agreement, be left to the arbitrary opinion of military commanders. In the words of the Preamble, &quot; Until a more complete code of the Laws of War could be drawn up, the High Contracting Parties deem it expedient to declare that, in cases not covered by the rules adopted by them, the inhabitants and the belligerents remain under the protection and governance of the principles of the law of nations, derived from the usages established among civi-lized peoples, from the laws of humanity, and from the dictates of the public conscience.&quot;In view of this declaration, the use of liquid fire, characterised by the French as a refinement of barbarity, stands clearly con-demned. The German defence, therefore, falls: it merely affords an instance of their usual practice when contemplating the commission of an illegal act, namely, to advance some plea of justification in order to satisfy neutrals and to retain the right of protesting against the commission of alleged breaches of the laws of war on the part cf the Allies. It is also clear thar the use of liquid fire by the Allies was merely retaliatory and, therefore, perfectly legitimate.Liquid fire was more largely used by the Germans than by the Allies, but its employment was not very extensive. It was chiefly employed in street fighting and in attacking dug-outs, and it value lay principally in its moral effect. This, specially at first, was considerable; and the Germans undoubtedly anti-cipated that they would be able, as in the case of poison gas, to secure by means of liquid fire considerable military advantages before the Allies were able to provide adequate measures of protection or retaliation.As has been already stated, the first British attack was not made until 13 months after experiments were first undertaken by the British Authorities, As the Germans first used liquid fire in June, .1915, this seems to suggest that prior to the out-break of war they had contemplated its employment, and had commenced to make the necessary arrangements for its use.Copies of the Note of the 16th October, 1914, and of other documentary evidence are attached.War Office, 121/2/196M.I.6.L., April, 1919.Documentary Evidence.0154/3947.

The accounts of all agreed very closely, and the following gives, as far as I can judge, a reconstruction of the affair based on the information obtained.The &quot; FJammenwerfer&quot; were used by the enemy opposite our G5, G10A and G10 trenches, and perhaps also somewhat further to our left, i.e., over a front of 150 to 200 yards.For the last four days the enemy had been extremely quiet in this region, but a great deal of work had been going on: digging-, Limbering and sapping. It had also been noticed :-(Birkin); that the enemy had for some time been making large loopholes about 18 inches square in his parapets and about 10 feet apart, especially in his new trenches; in some cases they could not have been so used, and there had been no attempt made to conceal them.On the night of July 29-30 the enemy had been particularly quiet; so much so that some of the sentries had reported that they thought no enemy was there. Contrary to the usual custom there had been no reply to bombs sent over by us.At about 3.20 a.m., two projectiles were sent over by the enemy, which burst about 250 yards apart behind our lines in or near Zouave Wood with a very slight explosion, making a noise like a &quot; bunib&quot; (Warrant). After bursting, flames appeared for some yards round them and burnt for perhaps half
to two minutes. It seems uncertain whether any more of these projectiles were sent over; one officer (Boughey) thought many were, but most thought there were only two. Anyway, these projectiles gave rise to a report that the wood was on fire.Immediately after, great clouds of black smoke and jets of flame appeared in front of our trenches. In places the smoke appeared first; in others the flames. It appears that these were due to jets of burning liquid issuing from the enemy&apos;s trenches. They were not all turned, on simultaneously, but very rapidly one after another, going generally from our right to our left. In places it was not regularly from right to left, but in any order. No incendiary bombs thrown to ignite the jets were seen. The distance between the jets was estimated at about one every 5 or 6 yards (about 18 to 20 in 100 yards). At first all seemed to think that mines were being exploded, but there was no sound of explo-sion nor any sort of noise at all. The wall of flame produced was probably 10-15 feet high. The black smoke reached the tops of trees and was estimated at 30-40 feet. The whole con-flagration lasted probably about 2 minutes; some thought as much as 4 or 5 minutes. Simultaneously with the appearance of the flames a very heavy bombardment with trench howitzers and shrapnel began, the support trenches being particularly heavily shelled.    This bombardment was kept up for some hours.The jets of flame were 30 to 40 yards long, and in those places where the German saps were not more than 15 yards away the flames projected over our trenches. Some say that the flames lapped over our parapets and flowed into our trenches, but this is doubtful. One officer (Broughton Gilkes) stated that the jets waggled about as if issuing from a moving hosepipe.Immediately the first jets were turned on the Germans were seen getting over their parapets, and the attack was made very soon after the flames had died down. In this attack the advance of the enemy was very irregular. Considerable numbers advanced, but in twos and threes, and no sort of a line was kept. None of them were seen carrying anything on their backs. There was very little wind, if any; what there was seems to have been towards the enemy&apos;s lines.In one place opposite the 5th Oxfords, where the enemy&apos;s trenches were 30-35 yards away, the cloud of smoke and flame ,was seen, but it appeared to hang over the German trenches and did not reach ours (Weeks). The Germans did not subse-quently attack here. There was no flame attack on the left of this. Very few of our men appear to have been burnt at all seriously. Some had eyebrows and hair singed, but no one knew of anyone who had been seriously burnt. Most of the officers were of the opinion that none had been burnt at all. Some were slightly blistered on the hands and face from small drops of burning liquid.The success of the enemy&apos;s attack appears to have been entirely due to its surprise and to the moral effect produced by the flames and smoke, which were evidently very terrifying. All the officers spoken to were of opinion that we could have held our trenches had the men sheltered themselves from the flame by lying in the bottom of the trenches.   One officer (Broughton Gilkes)&apos;, however,
considered that this would have required &quot; supernatural pluck.&apos;&apos; As it was, our men seem to have begun to leave the trenches immediately the jets were turned on. One officer described the smell as that of burning oil. There was no suggestion by any-one that the smoke or fumes were poisonous, and it was nearly certain that the attacking enemy wore no respirators or goggles.Our machine guns were not affected by the smoke and flames. One was, however, blown up by a shell, and one jammed. Some of our men stated that the Germans waved the French flag,, and that they ceased fire in consequence, there being no officers about.(Signed) .

In the enemy&apos;s successful attack with Flammenwerfer at the end of July, one of the large and about nine of the smaller type were used. The small type is carried on the back, and would m used in the following up an attack. A special detachment of the Guard Pioneers came to work the apparatus and rehearsed the attack in the presence of the Corps Commander. (General von Deimling) near Koelberg some days beforehand. There was a very strict censorship on all correspondence after this rehearsal to prevent leakage of the news of the impending attack.The deserter further stated that there are Flammenwerfer in position in the sector occupied by the .105th Regiment, and oil receptacles or reserve lighting apparatus (bundles of soaked sticks) in the trenches of the 172nd Regiment. He assumes that this means an attack to regain the lost crater is con tern-plated, and that two battalions will be employed, one each of the 105th and 172nd Regiments. ,      ^M.O. 2 (c).September 16th, 1915.8.S. 459.

No. 26655 op Secret.Flammenwerfer.The attached extract from the report of the Commander of the Flammenwerfer Troops regarding the experience gained in the recent fighting with this weapon is forwarded for information.Extract: from a report of the Commander of the 3rd and 4th Guard Pioneer Battalions regarding the recent fighting with Flammenwerfer.Since the 21st February, 1916, Flammenwerfer have been employed on 51 occasions, on all of which, except two, they were employed in&apos; the attack.Of these engagements 41 were successful and enabled our troops to advance; 10 were unsuccessful because the flammenwerfer-werfer squads were shot down before they arrived , within &quot; spraying distance &quot; or because the trenches, block-houses, etc., which had been captured by means of the Flammenwerfer had eventually to be abandoned.Experiences.A. General. The task of the Flammenwerfer during the attack consists in mastering isolated hostile defences which continue to resist and thus prevent our infantry from advancing. This task was fulfilled in the majority of cases during the recent fighting.
As a general rule, at least one Flammenwerfer squad should be allotted to each infantry company which is attacking this squad should follow a short distance behind the leading skirmish line. The company commander will indicate to the commander of the Flammenwerfer squads the objective which is to be gained, but will, as far as possible, allow him a free hand in the execu-tion of his task. A few bold infantry men will be attached to a Flammenwerfer squad which, compromises two light flammenwerfer-werfer. The attachment of machine guns is very advantageous if the Flammenwerfer squad and the machine guns can work together before the attack. For this reason single machine guns are included in the organisation of Flammenwerfer detachments.B. Actual Examples. Large Flammenwerfer can at times be brought up and employed with advantage. It was possible on several occasions, though with great difficulty, to bring them up into the most advanced lines and employ them there against the enemy&apos;s concrete blockhouses, etc. Three large flammenwerfer-werfer were taken into Fort Douaumont and successfully employed.The small Flammenwerfer have proved especially valuable in wood and village fighting, against the enemy&apos;s blockhouses, and for the purpose of working along the trench in order to clear it. It was again found that a single jet directed through the loop-holes of blockhouses drove out the gun teams of the machine guns inside and generally compelled them to surrender.The occupants of the blockhouse frequently closed the loopholes by means of their iron shutter when attacked by Flammenwerfer. The Flammenwerfer squad took advantage of the fact that the machine guns were thereby put out of action, and rushed forward to the entrance to the blockhouse and directed a jet through the entrance.Flammenwerfer were also successfully employed in village fighting. The enemy frequently remained in deep cellars or cave-like dug-outs, from which he could not be driven, by rifle or hand grenades. A jet directed for a fairly long period through a loophole or through the entrance was quite sufficient to persuade the garrison to surrender., The flames also drove the enemy out of the upper stories of defended houses, the latter being frequently set on fire by the jet of flame.The creeping forward of the Flammenwerfer squads, which wae practised for several weeks with a view to employing this&apos;method in the advance on the Haute de Meuse, proved most successful. It was successfully employed on more than 30 occasions. The men crawled forward silently and by circuitous routes towards the objective, making every use of shell holes and other available cover. Quite short rushes by individuals are also advantageous. When the village of Samogneux and the &quot; Bauernschreok&quot; Battery in the Haumont ravine were captured, the flammenwerfer-werfer squads crept forward for more than 100 yards, over country which was for the most part treeless.In many cases the squads which have crawled forward find themselves faced with 40 or 50 yards of entirely open ground
before they can reach their objective. This difficulty was fre-quently surmounted by directing for some time a jet of flame be-tween the squad and the objective; under cover of the smoke cloud produced, the squad was able to rush forward to within attacking distance of its objective.The moral effect of the flames was very considerable. Many of the enemy surrendered before the flames reached them, and frequently even when a smoke cloud was produced at some little distance from them. During the fighting at Sanaogneux and Haumont, the Flammenwerfer squads ran short of fuzes and continued to operate their jets without setting fire to them. Even this induced the occupants of houses to surrender.The Flammenwerfer detachments (down to individual squads) must be placed under the orders of the Infantry Commander responsible for the tactical execution of the operation. This Commander must allot the general objective of the flammenwerfer-werfer detachments, etc., and duly consider their proposals; but he must leave the technical and tactical execution of the task to the Flammenwerfer Commanders. In any case the Infantry Commander must ascertain the. limits of this weapon for the close combat both from a technical and a tactical point of view. It has happened, for instance, that an Infantry Com-mander has allotted to the Flammenwerfer the impossible task of directing a jet against the enemy&apos;s position from a distance of 220 yards.Copies issued to: Battalions.

MEMORANDUM V.British War Office Memorandum as ,to the Employment ofPrisoners of War,, On the 30th November, 1917, the following letter was received by the War Office from the Field Marshal Commander-in-Chief, British Armies in France.&quot; I have the honour to request that I may be informed whether in the opinion of the Army Council, prisoners of war may be employed on work of repair in a Gun Carriage Factory. Skilled mechanics would be required for this work, which would principally consist of repairing and adjusting the elevating gears of the gun carriage.&quot; I have previously ruled that the term &apos; handling muni-tions of war&apos; prevents their employment on work which the direct handling of ammunition, guns (whether new or dere-lict), rifles and&apos;bombs is involved.&quot;Restrictions have not, however, been placed by me on their employment in &quot; (a) R.F.C. workshops where damaged aeroplanes are dis-mantled and packed for transfer to England;&quot; (.6) A.S.C. Mechanical Transport workshops where every nature of repair is done to motor vehicles; or in&quot; (c) R.E. workshops where general foundry work and the repair of signal instruments is effected.&quot;To this letter the following reply was sent on the 17th December, 1917:  &quot; In reply to your letter, No. A.G./P.W. 34, of the 30th November, 1917, regarding the employment of prisoners of war on repair work in a Gun Carriage Factory, I am com-manded by the Army Council to observe that the Hague Rules in regard to the nature of the work upon which prisoners of war may be employed are somewhat vague. They merely state that the work must not be excessive and must have no connection with the operations of the war. These Rules did not, however, contemplate the conditions of State mobilisation where work of almost any kind necessarily has some suoh connection.&quot; The application of the Hague Rules to the present war was recently considered by the German Military Courts, and their view appears to be &quot; (1) that the work upon which a prisoner of war may beemployed can only be judged on the merits of each individual case; &quot; (2) it is illegal to employ prisoners of war in the manu-facture of munitions intended for use against theirnative country or its Allies; &quot; (3) they may be employed on agricultural or forestrywork as well as on work of military property, suchas the improvement of parade and drill grounds andof rifle ranges;
mu (4/ they may be employed on preparative work, such as the transport of coke or of ores for the manufacture . .      of shells, because there is no direct connection, between such work and military operations; and&quot; (5) they can only claim exemption from such work as stands in direct relation to military operations in the area of hostilities.&quot; This interpretation appears to the Council to be a reason-able one, and applying it to the cases mentioned in your letter, they agree in regarding as unobjectionable the employment of prisoners of war in &quot;(a) R.F.C. workshops where damaged aeroplanes aredismantled and packed for transport to England; &quot;(b) A.S.C. Mechanical Transport workshops where everynature of repair is done to motor vehicles; &quot; (c) R.E. workshops where general foundry work and the repair of signalling instruments is effected. &quot; But the Council consider the employment of prisoners of war in repairing and adjusting the elevating gears of gun carriages is not legitimate.&quot;On the 16th January, .1918, Sir Douglas Haig addressed a further letter to the War Office as follows:  &quot;With reference to War Office letter 0103/2/1382 (M.I. 6.L.), dated 17th December, 1917 (paragraphs! and 5), I have the honour to inform you that certain parties of prisoners of war at Boulogne have refused to carry out the work of making dug-outs and trenches, which are solely for defensive protection against hostile aircraft bombs.&quot;I do not consider that this work stands in &apos; direct rela-tion to military operations in the area of hostilities,&apos; and &apos; taking the merits of this particular case&apos; I have issued instructions that these prisoners are to carry out this work.&quot; I shall be glad, however, if I may be informed whether, this decision meets with the approval of the Army Council.&quot;In reply, the War Office informed Sir Douglas Haig that in their opinion, prisoners of war could not legally be employed in digging dug-outs except, perhaps, on behalf of the civil popu-lation in undefended towns which could not legally be subjected to bombardment from the air.On the 11th February, 1918, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Command, reported that the prisoners of war workshops at Dorchester were in a position to manufacture or machine some metal articles for aeroplanes, engines, etc., of which some hundreds would be required. He proceeded to request that full particulars of requirements might be forwarded for consideration and report as to the possibility of carrying out any orders for the articles.In reply, he was informed that prisoners of war at Dorchester Camp were not to be employed in the manufacture or machining of metal articles for aeroplanes, engines, etc.
On receipt of this letter the General Officer Commanding-in-Ohief, Southern Command, enquired whether the authority given for the employment by a Mr. Sellers of two German prisoners on turning aluminium and steel fittings for aeroplanes was to con-sidered as cancelled. To this letter a reply was sent containing instructions that the two prisoners of war employed by Mr. Sellers should be withdrawn.On the 25th April, 1918, Sir Douglas Haig referred to the decision forwarded in reply to his letter of the 16th January, 1918, and requested to be informed whether, in the Councils opinion, prisoners of war would be employed in filling sand-bags for the protection of hospitals in Boulogne. He pointed out that these hospitals, bearing as they did the Geneva Cross, could not be subjected to bombardment, while the protection afforded by these sand-bags would be extended just as much to sick and wounded German officers and men as to British soldiers.The War Office replied that, in their opinion, that was work on which prisoners of war might legitimately be employed.The question what work prisoners of war might legitimately be called upon to perform was raised again in August, 1918, in connection with the second Hague Prisoners&apos; Agreement.That Agreement contained an Article (No; 28) regulating the treatment of British and German prisoners of war. The Article ran as follows:  &quot; The treatment of prisoners of war shall follow the prin-ciples laid down in international agreements. In par-ticular they are to be protected from acts of violence and personal insults and from public curiosity, and are to be treated humanely. They may not be compelled to do any &apos; work which is directly connected with the operations of war.&quot;When the ratification of this Agreement was being considered by the War Cabinet the Director of Military Intelligence drew attention to Article 28. He pointed out that considerable mis-apprehension existed in the minds of prisoners as to the meaning of the prohibition of employment on work which was &quot; directly connected with the operations of the war &quot;; and he stated that the evidence in our possession showed that British prisoners had often been punished for refusing to do work which they might legitimately be called upon to perform. He therefore thought it desirable to define more precisely the meaning of the phrase if it could be done without long and difficult negotiations.The War Cabinet shared this view and requested Sir George Macdonogh to prepare a memorandum defining more precisely the meaning of the phrase &quot;work connected with the operations of the war,&quot; and to place himself in communication with the Prisoners of War Department with a view to concerting such action as might be deemed expedient and practicable.In accordance with these instructions the attached memo-randum was written by the General Staff and a copy was for-warded by the Prisoners of War Department.
On the 1st November, 1918, a further letter was received from Sir Douglas Haig, with reference to the War Office letter of the 17th December, 1917, with regard to the employment of prisoners of war on salvage work. The letter contained the following observations:  Owing to the military situation old battlefields are now behind the 30 kilometre line and they provide a most fruitful ground for salvage work.&quot; The only labour which can be spared from an economical and military point of view for this purpose is that supplied by prisoners of war labour.&quot; My instructions at present lay down that prisoners of war are not to handle &apos; munitions of war &apos; (War Office letter 0103/8472 D.P.W., dated 11th August, 1916), under which I have included all live ammunition and all serviceable guns and rifles, but excluded derelict rifles and fired- shell-cases salved on old battlefields.&quot; I should like to qualify this exclusion still further by adding that prisoners of war may be employed on the salvage of all ammunition and guns found on old battlefields, as otherwise it means that the work has to be performed twice over, in the first instance by prisoners of war companies col-lecting certain material, and in the second instance by other labour companies (white or Chinese) traversing the same ground and collecting what the prisoners of war have left behind them.&quot; In the case of the salving of derelict British ammu-nition, it might possibly be alleged that this had a slight direct 1 connection with the operations of war,&apos; because a proportion of it may be issued again, but in the case of German ammunition, this connection would appear to be both indirect and infinitesimal, as no use can be found for it.&quot; I would, therefore, request that I may be informed whether it will meet with the approval of the Army Council if I issue orders that prisoners of war may be employed on the salvage of all material found on old battlefields outside the 30 kilometre line, of whatever nature this material may consist, or in the alternative that they may salve their own ammunition.&quot;A telegraphic reply was sent that no objection was seen to the employment of German prisoners on salvage work. This reply, however, was not despatched until after the conclusion of the armistice, whereby, of course, the position had been materially altered.War Office,M.I. 6 L. 1024.23rd December, 1918.Law as to the Employment of Prisoners of War.The principle on which the employment of prisoners of war is based is that work is beneficial to the prisoners of war themselves.
this principle was first given Conventional sanction in the Brussels Declaration of 1874, which laid down the following regulations:  Article 25.&quot; Lea prisonniers de guerre peuvent etre employes a cer-tains travaux publics qui n&apos;aient pas un rapport direct avec les operations sur le theatre de la guerre, et qui ne soient pas extenuants ou humiliants pour leur grade militaire, s&apos;ils appartiennent a 1&apos;armee, ou pour leur position officielle ou eociale, s&apos;ils n&apos;en font point partie.&quot; Ils pourront egalement, en se conformant aux disposi-tions reglementaires a fixer par 1&apos;autorite militaire, prendre part aux travaux de 1&apos;industrie privee.&quot;Article 26.&quot; Les prisonniers de guerre: ne peuvent etre astreints d^ucune maniere a prendre une part quelconque a la pour-suite des operations de la guerre.&quot; Some uncertainty prevailed as to whether the effect of&apos; these regulations was to prohibit the employment, of prisoners of war on all work connected with the operations of the war, or whether they could legitimately be foreed-to perform work of this nature at any place outside the zone of operations.The Hague Convention of 1899 embodied Articles 25 and 26 of the Brussels Declaration in a single clause, and made it clear that the prohibition was. intended to be general, and the provisions of the 1899 Convention, with the addition of a clause exempting officers from liability to work, were adopted by the Hague Con-vention of 1907.&quot;The regulations on the subject in the Hague Convention of 1907 are, however, still somewhat vague. The Convention merely lays down that the State may employ the labour of prisoners of war, other than officers, according to their rank and capacity, and that the work must not be excessive and must have no con-nection with the operations of the war. Prisoners may also be authorised to work for the public service, for private persons or m their own account.The framers of the Hague Convention of 1907 did not, how-aver, contemplate the conditions existing in the present war of the universal mobilisation of the belligerent States and the con-eequent fact that work of almost any kind must necessarily, in auch circumstances, have some connection with the war.It is obvious that the existence of this condition necessitates some modification in practice of the 1907 regulations, and the extent to which they are applicable in the present war was oon-sidered earlier in the war by the German Military Courts. Their conclusions were as follows:  (1) That the work on which a prisoner of war&quot; may be em-ployed can only be judged on the merits of each individual case. (2) It is illegal to employ prisoners of war in the manu-facture of munitions intended for user against their native country or its allies.
MEMORANDUM VI.Agreement with the German Government as to the Non-employment op Non-Commissioned Officers.In a note verbale of 28th February, 1915, the German Govern-ment, after referring to Article 6 of the Hague Rules, propose that certain classes of prisoners of war (who may conveniently be collectively described assuperior non-commissioned officers &quot;) should be accorded certain privileges; such as exemption from all measures of a derogatory character having regard to their posi-tion, and special treatment as regards accommodation and employment.His Majesty&apos;s Government replied on 24th March that German prisoners of this class were already treated on the lines indicated by the German Government and requested similar consideration for gentlemen cadets and warrant Warrant Officers Classes I and II, these being the ranks corresponding to those named by the German Government/* Note.-The British ranks mainly affected are : Conductor, Army Ordnance Corps. Sergeant Major.Corporal Major (Household Cavalry). Farrier Corporal Major (iHouBehold Cavalry). Farrier Sergeant Major.Quartermaster Corporal Major (Household Cavalry).Kegimental Quartermaster Sergeant.Squadron Corporal Major (Household Cavalry).Squadron Sergeant Major.Battery Sergeant Major.Troop Sergeant Major.Company Sergeant Major.(3) They may be employed on agricultural or forestry work, as well as on work on military property, e.g., the improvement of parade and drill grounds and of rifle ranges.(4) They may be employed on preparative work, e.g., the transport of coke or of ores for the manufacture of shells, because there is no direct connection between such work and military operations.(5) They can only claim exemption from such work as stands in direct relation to military operations in the area of hostilities.These conclusions appear to be perfectly reasonable. They have been approved by the War Office and the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Ohief, France, and have been applied by the War Office in determining the kinds of work on which German prisoners of war in the hands of the British Military Authorities may legitimately be employed.G. M.General Staff, War Office,10th August, 1918.
The necessary instructions in the matter were issued by the War Office.In a note of 4th November, 1915, confirming this agreement the German Government specifically mention (1) separate quar-ters from other prisoners, and (2) no compulsion to work, except as superintendents, as being among the privileges to be accorded.On the 30th December, 1915, the German Government an-nounced their willingness to agree that all non-commissioned officer prisoners of war, without exception, shall be privileged to the extent that they will not be required to work whether inside the camp or outside except in the capacity of overseers.His Majesty5s Government agreed to this proposal and instruc-tions were issued by the War Office on 11th January, 1916.Careful watch was kept over the way in which the German Government carried out this agreement, and reference may be made to paragraph 4 of a memorandum by the Government Cbm-mittee dated the 9th June, 1916, on this subject (copy attached). A copy of the memorandum was sent to the American Ambassador on 16th June, with a view to his correcting the abuses shown therein.Nothing contained in the agreement prevented the employment of non-commissioned officers who volunteered for work, and a number both of British and German non-commissioned officers did this. The action of the British N.C.O&apos;s. was, however, in many cases caused by the harsh treatment accorded by the Germans to such as refused so to volunteer.Constant representations throughout the war were made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the German Government regarding the proper fulfilment of the agreement, and the German Govern-ment always maintained that they were fulfilling it. To a certain extent, however, it was rendered nugatory by reason of the disgraceful conditions in which N.C.O&apos;s. who did not volunteer were kept, some of these N.C.O. camps being notorious for harshness of treatment, deprivation of all privileges, etc.In conclusion it should be noted that Lance-Oorporals are not classed as N.C.O&apos;s. for this purpose, the status of Lance-Corporal being an appointment and not a rank, the rank of a Lanee-Corporal being private. The like applies in the case of the German &quot; Gefreiter.&quot;MEMORANDUM VII.INSTRUCTIONS TO THE OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF WORKING KOMMANDOS.Inspectorate of Prisoner of War Camps in the Sphere ofthe 2nd Army Corps.Steftin,April 15, 1917./. General Rules.1. The officer in charge of the guard will be appointed by order of the camp commandant through the commander of the battalion, and is the superior of all the &quot; Landsturm &quot; men in the kommando,
2. The officer in charge is responsible for the closest adherence to these instructions, and to the special legislation regulating certain cases. The officer in charge must take over the working kommando at the appointed time at the main camp. He will receive all necessary directions at the place appointed by the kommandantur. There he will also receive the necessary docu-ments, instructions,, &amp;c3. On the officer in charge being relieved of his command, in default of other orders, the next in seniority will become officer in charge.4. The guards must make it their business never to let the pri: soners forget that they are soldiers, and as such that they must give German officers and superiors the military salute, and behave courteously to their employers.II. The March to the Station and to Quarters.On the march from the camp to the station, during transit, and on the march from the place of arrival to their destination, the officer in charge must dispose of the guards under his com-mandso as to render impossible under any circumstances the escape of prisoners of war.The kommando must be at the station half an hour before the departure of the train. On the march from the camp to the station, and from the station to the place of work, the officer in charge is responsible for order in the column on the march. Smoking is forbidden during the march and in the station.When halted at the station the column must wait in unbroken formation, and the Landsturm must not absent themselves from the prisoners. It is strictly forbidden for any prisoner to enter the station restaurant. Prisoners must not be allowed to occupy sweats in the train or on platforms while Germans- are standing. The guards must follow closely the directions of railway officials.Prisoners of war are not permitted to hold any intercourse with the civilian population during a halt. All clothing must be adjusted before leaving the train. Prisoners or guards must not appear&apos;in the station with tunics unbuttoned.IIL-Arrival at the Place of Work.On arrival at the place of work the officer in charge must present himself to the employer. If the kommando is to work for a- municipality he musti repair, to. the local, authority to acquaint him with: the strength of the- kommando, and in case of his absence to his representative.IV. AccoTnmoddUon for Prisoners.1, The room to have strong walls and at least 5 cb. m. internal capacity for each1 prisoner.2. Iron bars which cannot be detached from the inside of the apartment must!be fixed in front of the windows-.3. There&quot; must be a good strong entrance door; with a firm) lock: On the outside of the door there mustibe- also an iron oi wooden bar fixed with a padlock, or in case the deoaci shouJidi
mhappen to open inwards, a second strong lock on the outside, which cannot be removed from inside.4. Roof and floor to be solid, also the apartments above, below, and next to the prisoners&apos; room to be kept locked, as escape has often been facilitated by such rooms being kept open.5. The living room must be capable of being heated.V. Interior Arrangement of the Prisoners&apos; Accommodation.1. The prisoners&apos; beds must not be immediately on the ground.2. The foundation of the beds must consist of boards. On these should be placed a sack stuffed with straw, wood wool, hay, shavings, paper, &amp;c, and two blankets for cover.3. Each prisoner must have a bolster stuffed as above.4. Between each bed there must be a wooden partition, a few centimetres higher than the bed itself.5. Hooks must be supplied for hanging up clothes, as well as a shelf to hold the prisoners&apos; personal effects.6. Each prisoner must have an eating-bowl, a spoon and a towel. A washing-basin for every two or three men. The towel must be washed once a week.7. Soap and soap-powder will be distributed to prisoners and Landsturm men by the local authorities on receipt of tickets. Prisoners of war are advised every Sunday to boil all their washing (with the addition of half or a whole packet of soap-powder according to the number of prisoners) for at least one hour. It will then only be necessary to rinse the linen in warm water. Those prisoners employed in manufactures, on the rail-way, or in any trade or. profession, and also the Landsturm men pay for their soap, but the local employer is expected to provide soap free of charge for prisoners doing less remunerative work.8. Should the accommodation not conform to the above re-quirements, the complaint is to be lodged modestly with the employer, asking how soon a change can be made. Failing this, application to be made to the kommandantur.9. Night latrines must be arranged for, if necessary, in a vestibule, ante-room, &amp;c. In any case, only smaller wants must be supplied for in the sleeping apartments.V/. Guards&apos; Accommodation.1. The guards&apos;&apos; accommodation must be separate from that of the prisoners. Their apartment must be capable of being warmed. They can claim bedsteads with the usual bedding. There must be conveniences for storing clothes in the rooms, as well as a possibility of locking up ammunition, official papers, &amp;c.2. The sleeping room of the guard must be connected with the prisoners&apos; quarters by a bell, if not contiguous and capable of observation by means of a hatchway which can be locked.3. The officer in charge must immediately inform the kom-mandantur of. their arrival, and report on the accommodation provided.

Cleanliness.1. All living rooms are to be cleaned and aired daily before work is begun or by prisoners specially retained for this purpose (unfit or such like) and the beds to be tidied before leaving the room. If necessary a few prisoners may be left behind for a certain time for this work, to follow the others as soon as it is completed.Men cannot be forced to rise earlier for this purpose.2. The living rooms must be washed down twice a week.3. The importance to health of the greatest cleanliness of body and clothing is particularly insisted on. Hair must not be allowed to grow too long.4. No opportunity of bathing must be neglected.5. Careful observation of any scabs or lice. Directly any such are noticed the prisoner must be isolated, and the employer and the nearest doctor informed. The doctor&apos;s report is immediately to be forwarded to the camp kommandantur.Report.Kommando No. .   Place the 19(District.)To the kommandantur of the prisoners of war camp,SDr. P. has certified that prisoner issuffering from scabs.     The prisoner has been isolated (may remain here).   Will be sent by train to-morrow at o&apos;clock to the camp hospital.Sd. , officer in charge.company battalion. .(In urgent cases a telephone message or telegram to be sent by the employer.)6. The employer must see to it that there is a plentiful supply of hot water both for personal use and for laundry purposes.7. The beds, clothes, and linen must be washed regularly, the walls and ceiling of the living rooms whenever necessary.8. Woollen coverings and coats must be beaten at least once a week, and also exposed to the sun.
9. The employer must so arrange the work that there is ample time for the work of cleaning, and he will be expected to provide all the utensils necessary for this purpose.VIIL-The Duties of the Guard.I. The guard ranks superior to the prisoners, and it is his duty to support the employer.2. The officer in charge must daily ascertain the prisoners&apos; work from the employer or his representative. In the case of the municipal kommundos, the distribution of the prisoners within the municipality is the business of the local board.3. The prisoners are to constitute a help and support for the employer, hence he alone has the power to determine both the form of employment and the place of employment (within the district or the factory premises).-4. It will not always be possible for the prisoners to work in a body. In the country in particular, it will be unavoidable that they should work with the civil population, as also that some prisoners should have to work alone. This will not con-travene the regulations.5. Should special posts not have been allotted to the Land-sturm men they must continuously exercise control on their rounds during the working day.6. While carrying out their duties as guards, the guards must not lie down. They must devote their entire attention to the prisoners.Any lapse on the part of guards will he severely punished. The officer in charge must report any offence on the part of the guard without delay to the kommandantur. This is an official order any omission will be heavily punished.7. The guards must always wear the. guard uniform (cloth or drill) when on duty with the prisoners, and also the side arms and the cartridge pouch, and they must carry rifles.In closed factory buildings, where weapons easily rust owing to chemical action, the guards are allowed to carry revolvers, if the employer supplies them. In the case of prisoners doing solitary work, as also when they work with the native popula-tion, it will be necessary to appoint an auxiliary guard if a Landsturm man cannot be posted.8. Smoking is permitted on patrol, but strictly forbidden in stables, barns, granaries, woodlofts and threshing-floors and everywhere else where civilians are forbidden to do so by the employer or by police regulations.9. The guards must never relax their vigilance.10. Should there be in the same place prisoners&apos; kommandos without a guard, these prisoners must be guarded with the others,, even if they should belong to another camp. The pay sheets must be kept separate.II. Only those holidays generally celebrated in Germany may De observed. Special holidays may only be celebrated when the eonditions of work warrant it and the employer agrees to it Exceptions will be ordered by the Ministry of War
12. Laziness and disobedience are to be severely cautioned. Obedience must be enforced by solitary confinement, deprival of food, and in the last resort, as in the case of insubordination, by the use of arms. Persistent disobedience must be reported to the kommandantur.13. Prisoners who are not indispensable must not be passed on to other employers, but must be reported to the komman-dantur for withdrawal.IX. Auxiliary Guards.1. The auxiliary guards are civilians. They are appointed by the Landrat. They must be made known to the guards and the prisoners, and the prisoners warned of their duty to obey them.2. They are subordinate to the officer in charge of the military guard when they are serving together. In case of necessity they must take duty at night. They wear a white armlet with the seal of the kommandantur to which the kommando is attached. The auxiliary guards must report any disobedience and any laziness at work to the officer in charge on the first opportunity in certain cases immediately.3. Any new regulations and any which may not have yet been officially notified are to be immediately reported to the auxiliary guards by the officer in charge.X. Intercourse with the Employer.1. Demeanour to the employer or his representative must be invariably respectful and courteous. In dealing with him the guard should conduct himself as in the presence of a superior officer. (No smoking, hands not to be carried in the pockets, no familiar form of address, &amp;c.)2. The employer arranges the work, the hours being those customary in the district. In urgent cases feeding of cattle, pressing harvest work, bad weather, &amp;c. labour even may be requisitioned on Sundays and holidays. But for these times there will be adequate compensation, and such cases must remain exceptional.3. When a prisoner is employed as a servant or a farm labourer, &amp;c, i.e., in a situation demanding a different division of time, then his working hours become equivalent to the normal local working hours.4. The employer has power to send a guard independently -with a prisoner to another place for work in the same district, factory, &amp;c.   The guard must obey unconditionally.5. A guard must always remember that he should help and support his kommando wherever possible. He must therefore keep the prisoners at work by every means.6. In the same way as the guard lodges any complaint at the kommandantur, the employer should make complaints whether about guards or prisoners   without delay to the competent authority.7. Any movements of prisoners and guards return to camp, entry into hospital, escape of prisoners, admittance from camp
or from hospital should be immediately reported in writing to the kommandantur, giving the names of the respective prisoners and guards together with the date of change. With each report the number of the working kommando and the total number of guards and prisoners is to be repeated.XI. Subsistence.1. Prisoners will receive an adequate daily ration according to local custom.2. The regulations and the price lists drawn up by the kom-mandantur apply to the canteens. These must be signed by the camp commandant, and must bear the seal of the kommandantur. The food regulations in force for the entire German nation are in force also for prisoners and guards.In no circumstances may prisoners receive more food than the equally hard-working civil population. It is forbidden to give prisoners the following: Eggs, fat in the shape of butter, bacon and lard, all-cream milk, pulses except broad beans and &quot; Peluschken &quot; rice, pastry, biscuits, tinned preserves, poultry, fresh fish, coffee.3. The guards shall have nutritious and satisfying morning, midday and evening meals, such as the surrounding conditions are biest able to provide. The amount of bread due is to be supplied by the district authorities. All food questions concern-ing the guard are to be referred to the Commissariat Department of the 2nd A.K.4. There must be no requisitions contravening the general regulations. The guard cannot claim beer, &amp;c. But the employer may, if he chooses, supply drinks of such a nature.5. The purchase of alcoholic liquors of any kind for the prisoners is strictly forbidden.   For exceptions, see, XXII. 2.6. The allowance for subsistence is to be paid to the caterer who supplies the prisoners&apos; food, and not to the employer with whom they are registered.XH.-Clothing.1. The following kit is supplied to the guards of a working kommando: -Two cloth uniforms, one drill uniform, one over-coat, two shirts, two pair pants, one pair boots, one pair lace shoes, one field cap, one helmet or &quot; Tschako,&quot; one knapsack, one bread bag, 30 cartridges, a rifle, side arms, a cartridge pouch, and rifle cleaning apparatus.2. The outfit for prisoners consists of two shirts, two pair of stockings or foot bandages, two pair pants, one cap, one suit of clothes, one overcoat, one pair boots or strap shoes, one pair clogs, and also (unless these are supplied by the employer) a palliasse cover, a bolster, and two coverlets. The hire of palliasse, bolster, and coverlets must be paid by the employer every month to the pay office of the camp kommandantur. Requests for further supplies of clothing, linen, or.footwear must be duly made to the kommandantur.  Clothing may not under
any circumstances be bought by the employer or the officer in charge on account of the kommandantur.3. Prisoners are forbidden to wear civilian clothes.4. The employer must notify the necessity for clothing for particular work at the kommandantur. Demands for underlinen and for mending materials must be made in the same way. The employer must supply boots for special occupations such as digging, work in sugar factories, &amp;c. requiring heavy footwear.5. In order to save their boots, prisoners are to wear clogs while doing work for which the wearing of boots is not essential, also in the evening after work.6. All useless articles of clothing, boots, and clogs to be returned directly on receipt of new ones. A list must be enclosed with every parcel of returned clothing and boots, stating whether they are to be exchanged or to be mended or are useless.7. Every week there is to be an inspection of clothes and linen. On Sundays mending will be done under the direction of the guard. Materials for mending are to be claimed from the main camp.8. The prescribed badges, i.e., an armlet and stripes of brown tent cloth on the trousers, are to be worn on the outer clothing.XIII. Escapes.1. The employer, the officer in charge of transport, and all other Landsturm and auxiliary guards must take great care to prevent escapes.2. Should the employer be found to be to blame for the escape the kommando may be withdrawn, as in the case of any offence against regulations, and the subsistence allowance will be with-held. This will be decided by the inspectorate. The escape of prisoners is to be reported immediately by the employer to the camp kommandantur. The officer in charge must at once send a full report to the kommandantur. Should he find diffi-culty in writing, he can ask help from the employer. . The employer is to add to the report of the officer in charge whether the latter&apos;s statement corresponds with the facts of the case.3. The escape must be reported to the office of the Landrat and to the police as soon as possible. The camp kommandantur must report any recapture of prisoners to the officer in charge of the kommando, who will also announce it to the prisoners. The escaped prisoners will, after undergoing punishment, be sent back to their work.4. Experience has shown that escapes usually take place from the living rooms, and they are made possible by the guard not locking in the prisoners at the right time and by lack of the necessary supervision during meals.5. When fugitives are recaptured, and their place of work can be ascertained, the employer will be summoned to fetch them back, provided the kommando is in the neighbourhood; otherwise the procedure is as per paragraph III. A circumstantial report must be forwarded to the camp kommandantur immediately the prisoner has been brought back,
XIV. Sickness.1. In the event of illness the competent doctor must be sum-moned by the employer.2. According to an Order from the War Ministry, the calling in of a military doctor is, where possible, commanded. Con-sequently, working camps up to 15 km. (further if served by a good train service) from ia military post, reserve or garrison hospital, are to be attended by a military doctor from the nearest garrison. However, this would only concern those cases in which the patients could not be transported to the main camp.3. Sick prisoners needing hospital treatment must invariably be sent to the main camp (always supposing that they are fit to be moved), or should this be too far off, to the nearest reserve hospital, or possibly to the nearest infirmary.4. In case of short illnesses or slight complaints, when it is inexpedient to take men to the main camp, they must be taken to the doctor, in order to save the latter heavy travelling expenses.5. There must be a clinical thermometer for every kommando, and the guards must be instructed in the use of it. Prisoners having a temperature of over 380 must not be forced to work.6. In cases of accident, followed by death, and in cases of suicide, the body must be left in statu quo until the inquest has taken place.   The kommandantur must immediately be informed.7. When death takes place from natural causes among prisoners of war the kommandantur must also be immediately informed. The competent doctor must certify the cause of death, and sign the death certificate. The burial will take place in the customary way. Costs of an interment, according to local custom, are to be claimed from the main camp on presenting the bills. The eerti-ficate of death must be handed in at headquarters.8. On recovery after illness, prisoners will be sent back to their original place of work. On receipt of notice the guard, or employer, or the auxiliary yuard, must immediately fetch the prisoner from hospital.XV. Leave.1. No guard may absent himself from the kommando without leave. A defaulter will be arrested- Leave is given by the camp kommandantur. Neither the officer in charge nor the employer has power to give leave. Application for leave must be made to the kommandantur. Under urgent circumstances (death, &amp;c.) it may be made by telegram or telephone by the employer.XVI. Prisoners are forbidden;1. Any intercourse with civilians which is not necessitated by the work.2. To absent themselves without a guard from their work or living rooms. Loitering about by single prisoners is to be rigor-ously prevented.3. To absent themselves during the night from their lodging without permission.4. Any appropriation of weapons.
5. No tools such as&apos; scythes, pitchforks, &amp;c, which might serve as weapons, to be left in the living rooms at night.6. Visits to restaurants and public halls by prisoners in com-pany with male or female employers has sometimes led to dis-agreeable discussions, and to demonstrations by patriotic G-ermans.Prisoners are strictly forbidden to frequent public places as well as all cinemas or other places of amusement. Prisoners will be withdrawn from an employer should any infraction of these rules occur.   The guard will be punished.7. Neither the employer or anyone else is permitted to give alcoholic beverages to a prisoner.For exceptions, see XVII., para. 2.XVII&apos;.-Prisoners are permitted:1. To smoke, but with the same restrictions which apply to the guard.  See VIII., para. 7.2. On Sundays, Tuesday and Fridays, a fruit wine up to J liter a head, and lightly fermented beer up to I liter per head may be bought at the canteen. This is to be procured from the main camp or through the employer.XVIIL-Roll Call.Prisoners must be counted twice daily, in the morning before going to work, and in the evening before they are locked in for the night.XIX.-Interpreters.Interpreters must work with the other prisoners, in so far as they are not engaged in their work of interpreter, or other orders are received from the kommandantur (for example, sergeant major in charge.)XX. Return of Prisoners.1. Before one or more prisoners are returned the reason must be given and the consent of the camp kommandantur obtained, except in the case of illness. Notice of the time of arrival must be given to the camp kommandantur.2. Exchange of prisoners is only permitted under most urgent circumstances. The kommandantur gives its decision on receiv-ing the employees written report. In this report, regiment, rank and camp No. must be given.3. The transfer may not be effected till the tickets made out by the Kommandantur have been received by the employer. Each prisoner must be accompanied on the journey by a military guard or a responsible auxiliary guard. If by an auxiliary guard, the costs of travel are borne by the employer.4. The employer must pay the costs if a return or exchange takes place solely at his (the employees) request.5. On completion of the work, the kommando will return to the camp, due notice having been given. Should the employer wish to retain a portion of the kommando the decision will rest with the inspectorate.
.,* 2346. If a prisoner is taken back to camp for punishment for refusal to work or any other reason, the employer must send a detailed report with his guard in order to avoid further inquiry.XXI, Postal Regulations for Prisoners in Working &apos; Kommandos.(a) Letters. 1. All postal communications without exception must pass through the main camp. The prisoners may not take their letters direct to the post, nor ask anyone else to do so for them. The officer in charge must pay special attention to this point.2. Prisoners may not give the place of work in their address, but must always give their own name, the main camp, identification-tion No., battalion and company. Therefore no cards, wrappers or notepaper may be used hearing the printed address of the employer or the place of work. The name of the sender to be written on every card and letter. The officer in charge must censor postal communications in this respect.3. Prisoners may write two letters of four pages and four cards every month. Two cards may be written in the place of each letter. The officer in charge must collect these letters before they are closed down, also postcards, and send them to the camp censor. The days for despatching letters are fixed by the camp commandant.4. Correspondence with prisoners in other camps or working kommandos is only permitted in the case of near relations (father, brother) on family matters.5. All correspondence must he made with a lead or indelible pencil.   Ink may not be used except for power of attorney.6. Picture postcards of buildings, towns, and villages, envelopes lined with tissue paper, and postcards with stamps affixed are prohibited.7. Correspondence may be conducted only in the following languages: German, French, English, Russian, Polish, Serbian, and Rumanian.(b) Money and Parcels. 1. Money orders and parcels are censored in the camp and handed to prisoners by the employers, who fetch them from the post, and are responsible for their delivery. The signed receipts must immediately be sent to the postal censor by the employer, with a certificate of correct delivery. The officer in charge must then open any tins found in the,parcels in the presence of the prisoners, in order to see whether they contain any contraband articles, such as weapons, printed matter, letters, &amp;c. These things must be sent to the postal censor with a declaration by the recipient. Any letters and printed matter that may be found, and which have not passed the censor, also anything that may arrive from abroad direct to the kommando, must be dealt with in the same way.2. Money orders which cannot be delivered must be returned by the employer by means of a fresh money order inscribed &quot;-military matter&quot; tq the postal censor of the camp.  The
reason for returning the money, together with the name of the prisoner for whom it was destined, and the number of the kom-mando must be inscribed on the back of the counterfoil. Remit-tances labelled &quot; military matter&quot; are sent post free, and must be stamped with the seal of the estate agent or municipality. Parcels which cannot be delivered must be returned to the postal censor with the reasons given on the address.3. It is strictly forbidden to send money in letters. This can only be done by means of money orders.(c) Newspapers. Newspapers may only be ordered through the camp kommandantur, with the exception of the &quot; Eussische Bote,&quot; which may be ordered through the employer or the guard direct from the publisher. The number of copies ordered must be submitted to the postal censor of the camp. The monthly subscription for the &quot; Bussische Bote&quot; is TO pf.; the &quot;Gazette des Ardennes,&quot; 70 pf.; the illustrated supplement to the &quot; Gazette des Ardennes,&quot; 20 pf.; &quot; Le Bruxellois,&quot; 80 pf.; and the &quot;Gazette de Lorraine,&quot; 1 m.(d) Telegrams. Prisoners are not allowed to use telephones or to telegraph.(e) Prisoners are strictly forbidden to hold postal intercourse with  .(a) each other;(b) any military persons, either at the front or in thecountry;(c) the civilian population;(d) any foreigners living in Germany!XXII. Money Matters and Pay.1. Costs of Transport.-The employer must bear the costs of transport for a single journey to and from the prisoners&apos; camp, and also for exchanges which are made at his request. The expenses for the journey to the place of work are paid out by the officer in charge, who receives this sum on account from the paymaster, and will be repaid again immediately by the employer. The fare will always be reckoned as from the nearest situated prison camp,2. Pay for Prisoners (*ee Addendum). Prisoners working at a trade receive a quarter of their wages in cask, not exceeding 3 M. a week. The remainder is credited to the prisoner and is to be handed to him on his return to camp. The payment of wages must be made in paper money as far as possible. The prisoners may use this sum for the purchase of any objects they may desire, such as watches, &amp;c. Goods are ordered through the camp kommandantur, if they cannot be procured personally in the place itself, or in the nearest town. Guards and prisoners are strictly forbidden to enter into correspondence with shops or commercial establishments of any kind.The officer in charge and the employer must pay attention that the prisoners are not cheated
When working on farms, prisoners shall receive a wage of at least 30 pf. a day. The employer is advised to increase the pay of prisoners to 60 pf. a day when they have charge of cattle, hence increased labour.It is desirable to enter into an agreement as, to the wages to be paid for all agricultural work.Addendum to XXII.From henceforth non-commissioned officer prisoners of war are to be paid a daily wage:  (1) For agricultural work 0.60 M. (hitherto 0.30 M.). (2) For industrial pursuits 40 per cent, of the gross wages (hitherto 25 per cent.).XXIII. Extra Pay for Guards.1. Military guards receive extra pay of 50 pf. per day. This is paid by the military authorities for farm and State agricul-tural work, and by the employer for industrial work.2. In kommandos for military purposes only there is no extra pay, and in forestry kommandos only for the working days.XXIV.-Book-keeping and Correspondence with the Kommandantur.1. There must be an inspection book in each working kom-mando, in which the inspecting officer may make short observa-tions or only a note of the inspection, with date and signature.2. Each officer in charge must keep a diary, inscribing the names of prisoners and the days on which they have worked.3. All correspondence with the camp kommandantur must be addressed as follows: to the Kommandantur of the Prisoners&apos; Camp.4. Correspondence with the postal department must be addressed as follows: &quot;To the Postal Censor&apos;s Office of the Prisoners&apos; Camp.&quot;5. In any communication to the kommandantur, the number of the working kommando, the names and numbers of the prisoners in question, also the serial number of the communica-tion under reply must be given.6. The employers must prepay their communications to the kommandantur, the pay office, &amp;c. They must not make use of the stamped envelopes allotted to guards for official purposes.XXV.-Use of Arms.The regulations for the use of arms by the guard are comprised in the order on the use of arms by the military issued 19** March, 1914.The guard is allowed to use his arms 1, If he is actually attacked.2. If he is seriously threatened with an attack, i.e., his safety jeopardised. 3. If he meets with actual resistance.
.4. If resistance is offered to him by means of a dangerous threat with assault j in order to ward off assault or to overcome the resistance..5. If obstinate disobedience is maintained to the order or prohibition of the guard and he cannot enforce obedience in any other way.6. If a prisoner escapes or tries to escape.7. In the protection of objects or persons (prisoners) com-mitted to his charge, or in order to prevent or obviate any interruption of his official duties by a third person.In all cases the butt end of the rifle and blank ammunition are first to be used.Shooting is only to be resorted to in the most urgent cases  (a) If the blank ammunition is not sufficient to attain the object;, (6) In cases of escape or attempted escape, after. he has called &quot; Halt &quot; once in a loud voice.Auxiliary guards are allowed to use arms on the same lines as guards. But not being the military superiors of the prisoners, they may not use arms as in paragraph No. 5. They must, should their orders or prohibitions meet with obstinate dis-obedience, report the case to the guard or to the camp kom-mandantur, who will then deal further with the matter^The weapon is with the exception of orders and prohibitions  the&quot; extreme, but also the only means of coercion of the guard.Blows with the hand or fist, or with sticks or clubs, and kicks are forbidden.Except in most exceptional and unusual cases, it is inexcusable to lay hands on a prisoner.1 XXVI. -Furnishing of Kommandos without Guards.I. Prisoners may be furnished without a guard if the proposed number sent to one single employer is not more than six and if auxiliary guards can be procured.2. The living room must be arranged and furnished with iron bars as laid down in TV.3. It will be necessary to have the consent of the Royal Landratsamt or of the local police for the employment of the . auxiliary guards.   Assurance must also be given to the kom-mandantur of the main camp that the accommodation fulfils the requisite demands.4. When prisoners are requisitioned for private persons the municipality or the agent of the estate, or, if in a town, the magistrate, must undertake the necessary guarantees. These bodies. are then responsible to the military authorities for the safety of the prisoners. This does not preclude the possibility of auxiliary guards being placed by the magistrate, the munici-pality, or the agent of the estate.5. The auxiliary guards must wear the prescribed badges. If taking prisoners by train to or from camp to the place of work the auxiliary guards must wear the prescribed badges, and will receive a stamped permit from the police. All other official regulations apply equally to these prisoners,
6. On the first day of the quarter, the employers, municipality, or estate agents must send a full report to the kommandantur of the main camps as to whether they are satisfied with the prisoners and their work. Any unusual events (e.g., refusal to work, escape, &amp;c.) must be reported immediately.7. Prisoners either from detached or larger kommandos, who are sent either alone or with a vehicle to a neighbouring place, must have a permit, which may, in isolated cases, be furnished by the municipality. For regular use the prisoner must have a permit from his kommandantur.8. Any requisition for working kommandos with or without guards must be forwarded through the local Landrat or the police authorities to the camp inspectorate.XXVII. Drafting of German Russians (Deutschrussen).1. The drafting of German Russians may be effected after a previous agreement with a magistrate or Landratsamt at the request of an employer or the care committee for German returned prisoners.2. The German Russians are allowed to reside with the employers.   There are no restrictions as to their lodging.3. The superintendence of the German Russians is entrusted to any guard authorised by the Landrat.4. The German Russians are permitted to wear plain clothes. In order to purchase these, the sum of 80 m. is allotted to them. Of this the prisoner receives 40 m. The rest of the 40 m. is retained by&apos; the care committee for payment when requisite. Besides this, 30 m. quarterly is granted to supplement worn-out clothes.The claim to money for clothing stands as from the 1st of the month after the prisoner has been brought to the kommando. It is, however, paid retrospectively in quarterly instalments. Payment will, however, not be made till the employer has given an assurance to the kommandantur that the clothes of the prisoner are in good condition.5. German Russians doing agricultural work are to receive during the winter half-year (October 1 to March 1) 80 pf. per day, and during the summer months (April 1 to September 30/) 1 m. for the full day&apos;s work. The employer is free to pay higher wages. The extra allowance for subsistence, 60 pf. a head per day, will be refunded to the employer for these prisoners also. &apos;When working as labourers on the land or in towns, German Russians will receive, besides free board and lodging, a minimum wage of 1.25 m. in winter, and 1.50 m. in summer, otherwise they will receive the customary local wages^ without deduction, provided they pay their own board and lodging.6. The employer has no right to exchange or send elsewhere the German Russians who have been allotted to him without special permission from the kommandantur.XXVIII.-Remarks. 1. All underhand practices and the giving of goods of any kind whatsoever to prisoners are forbidden.   Prisonew aw 10962 K t
strictly forbidden to possess compasses or maps which, may give information as to roads and railway. It is strictly forbidden even to lend maps.2. The taking of photographs and then only such as are unmounted or on postcards is only permitted with the consent of the camp kommandantur.Duplicate impressions must be sent for examination to the postal censor&apos;s office of the main camp. One proof copy must be retained by the censor, the second copy will be returned to the officer in charge. Only after this has been done may more copies be printed.3. A change of living room, or the exchange of a prisoner from one employer to another, can only be authorised by the competent kommandantur or by the inspectorate. The Land-sturm man may only appeal on private business to his company, on official business to his kommandantur. Any written com-munication whatsoever with the inspectorate or with general headquarters without special permission is strictly forbidden.4. The guards are not permitted to play cards with prisoners nor to become at all intimate with them.They must also pay attention that no relationship is entered into between prisoners and the civil population.5.

The &quot; Brussels&quot; passed over her, the periscope running along the ship&apos;s side.(Signed)     C. Fryatt,Master.&quot;The report was communicated to the Admiralty on the 8th April, 1915, and Captain Fryatt received, through his owners, the thanks of the Admiralty and of the Foreign Office for his action.On June 23rd, 1916, an elaborate plan appears to have been made for the capture of the s.s. &quot; Brussels,&quot; which was still commanded by Captain Fryatt. The capture was effected soon after the &quot;Brussels&quot; left the Hook of Holland for Tilbury, The &quot;Brussels&quot; was taken to Bruges, and Captain Fryatt and his 1st Officer (Mr. W. J. Hartnell) were taken there in the ship; they were questioned and photographed before being removed from the ship, and were then taken with other prisoners to Ruhleben, where they arrived on June 28th. It appears that Captain Fryatt became friendly with a Captain Turnbull, a pro-German British shipmaster, who was Captain of Barrack No. 1 in the Camp.
Captain Fryatt talked in a free way to this man, and although there is no evidence as to the precise information which he gave him, it is certain that Captain Fryatt from first to last did. noi attempt to conceal his part in the incident of the 28th March. On June 30th Captain Fryatt and Mr. Hartnell were taken to Bruges, where they were placed in cells. They were occasionally visited by German officials and questioned on the submarine war-fare and other subjects. According to Mr. Hartnell, Captain Fryatt again made a clear and open statement as to the facts ;so far as he was concerned. Up to June 15th Captain Fryatt and Mr. Hartnell were allowed to see each other, but from that date no communication was allowed to pass between them. On July 24th Captain Fryatt and Mr. Hartnell were again examined in detail. On July 27th they were taken to the Bruges Town Hall, where they were met by four others of the crew of the &quot; Brussels.&quot; Captain Fryatt was called before the tribunal at 12 o&apos;clock; he repeated his previous statements concerning the incident of the 28th March, 1915. Mr. Hartnell followed him, and up till the end of their evidence no one appears as having been charged to defend or represent Captain Eryatt. At that stage, an office.&apos; in uniform, speaking in broken English, informed Captain Fryatt that he was engaged to defend him. He took no part in the proceedings until the last few minutes, when he spoke a few words to the Court in German, and then turned to Captain Fryatt and informed him that he had been found guilty of being &quot; Franctireur.&quot; The name of this officer was Major Neuman. It appears that the Court then, retired, no sentence having beer. pronounced; and the prisoners were taken back to their cells, which they reached about 4.40.About- 5 p.m. the attention of M. Rommel, the Chief Com-missary of Police at Bruges, was directed to excitement in the Place de Bourg and at the Konimandantur and to the movements of Kriegsgerichtsrat Zaepfel, who, as will be seen below, presided at the Court Martial. Zaepfel was seen to reach Admiral von Schroeder&apos;s office. At 6 p.m. two Echevins (P under sheriffs) of Bruges one of whom was fetched from his house were ordered to be present at an execution.Shortly after Zaepfel&apos;s visit to Admiral von Schroeder two young German Naval Officers arrived at the prison and asked for Captain Fryatt, who was at the moment speaking to M. Schaloigne, then and later an inmate of the prison. He is described as an intelligent man, who speaks good English. Cap-tain Fryatt had shortly before informed him that he did not know what had been the result of his trial. The two officers took off Captain Fryatt to the place of execution, where the two Echevins, MM. de Schepper and von Hestenberghe, arrived after Captain Fryatt had been tied to the post and blindfolded. A tall pale officer read something, from which they understood that the condemned man whose name they did not know had been sentenced for trying to sink a submarine. Captain Fryatt was then shot, it being then about 6.30 p.m.According to the Echevins there were present at the execution Colonel von Bottelar commandant  de place his adjutant,
241Sponer, and Gruppengreser, Commissary of Police. M. Rommel, the chief commissary, states that von Schroeder was himself present with his dog, hut we doubt if this was correct. The Chief Commissary was not himself present The Echevins^ who were, do not mention Admiral von Schroeder, but do mention Colonel von Bottelar and his dog.A placard in three languages, signed by Admiral Von Schroeder, was issued, stating that Captain Fryatt had been condemned to death, and executed because, not being a member of the armed forces of the enemy, he attempted, on March 28th, 1915, to destroy a German submarine by ramming it. The notice concludes: &quot; Un acte pervers a recu ainsi son chdtiment tardif mais juste.&quot;It should be noticed that this placard was dated July 27th  the actual date of the trial and execution and that the official explanation was telegraphed from Berlin in time to be trans-mitted from Amsterdam to London on July 28th. The transla-tion which appeared in the Times concludes: &quot; One of the many nefarious franctireur proceedings of the British Merchant Marine against our war vessels has thus found a belated but merited expiation.&quot; The substantive identity of the wording of this official announcement, which must have been issued in Berlin early on July 28, with the wording of the placard dated July 2&apos;r is to say the least suspicious. An attempt is being made to discover the printer of the placard.It is now necessary to go back a little in time in order to realise the steps which the German authorities took before the trial.About 10 days before it took place the British Government had heard that Captain Fryatt was likely to be tried, and accordingly requested Mr. Gerard to enquire of the German Government if this was the case, and if so on what date the trial was to take place. Mr. Gerard formally made his enquiry by a note verbale dated July 20th. No reply was given. On July 22nd Mr. Gerard addressed another note verbale &quot; very urgent&quot; to the German Government calling attention to the previous note and asking permission to engage counsel for Captain Fryatt&apos;s defence.No written reply was made, but four days later, in the after-noon of July 26th, an Officer of the German Foreign Office called at the Embassy and informed Mr. Jackson, a member of the Ambassadors staff, that the trial was fixed for the next day at 9 a.m. before the &quot; Corps Gericht des Marine Corps,&quot; Bruges. He further stated that the Foreign Office had telegraphed for the trial to be postponed, but it could &quot;not force this to be done.&quot; The next day [July 28th] the Embassy was verbally informed over the telephone that the postponement of the trial had not been granted, and that Captain Fryatt had been tried and executed.No further communication on the subject was ever made to the American Ambassador, and no formal official reply to the note verbale has ever been made.Returning now to the day of the execution, rfc is stated by M. Verjuelin, the head of the prison, that a soldier &quot; F*iti&quot;
employed in the prison asserted that the day after the execu-tion a telegram arrived at the General Kommandantur ordering the postponement of the carrying out of the sentence. That something of the sort occurred is confirmed by M. Rommel, who is able to state that he has learnt from a reliable source (de source certaine) that an hour after the execution a telephonic order was received at the General Kommandantur to postpone it.Finally, M. Rommel, who performed his duties during the whole of the German occupation, says that with the exception of Captain Fryatt&apos;s no sentence of death was ever carried out at Bruges on the day it was pronounced. They were nearly always postponed for weeks, sometimes even for months.From the above facts the following propositions appear to be established. (1) That the management of the whole affair was in the hands of Admiral von Schroeder at Bruges. (2) That he refused the request of the Berlin Foreign Office to* postpone the trial, and insisted on its proceeding at once. (3) That about one hour after the termination of the trial the President of the Court saw him. (4) That he immediately confirmed the sentence, and (5) that this was the only case in four years, in which a death sentence was carried into execution at Bruges on the day on which it was pronounced.Admiral von Schroeder therefore is responsible for whatever was done.Two questions therefore.arise. (1) Was the Court properly constituted and the trial regularly conducted ? (2) Had Captain Fryatt committed any offence for which he could properly be brought to trial? If either of these questions is answered in the negative it is submitted that Admiral von Schroeder has committed an offence of which the substance, whatever the exact form may be, is that he caused Captain Fryatt to be judicially murdered.The evidence at present as to the constitution of the Court is not at all clear, but there are reasons indicated below for thinking that it was not properly constituted.In the communication made to Mr. Jackson on July 26th it was stated that Captain Fryatt would be tried by the &quot; Corps Gericht des Marine Corps &quot; at Bruges. This appears to be a Naval Oourt-Martial, and should be composed of a Kriegsgerichtsrat as President, and four Naval Officers of ranks according to the rank of the accused. The accused is given certain rights. The charge must be drawn up and communicated to him before the assembly of the Court. He is entitled to have someone to defend him, and the sentence must be confirmed before it is carried out, and confirmation ought not to be given until the accused has had an opportunity of exercising his right of appeal, which is open to him for one week after sentence.There is no evidence that the charge was ever delivered to Captain Fryatt. Mr. Gerard was refused the opportunity of providing him with counsel though the Court appointed some-one, as to whose conduct the statements differ. Mr. Hartnell, Captain Fryatfs First Officer, says that not until they had both given their evidence did anyone appear to defend them.. At that stage an officer speaking broken English told Captain Fryatt he
had been engaged to defend him. He took no part in the pro-ceedings till the last few minutes, but then spoke a few words to the Court and turned round and told Captain Fryatt he had been condemned as a &quot; franctireur.&quot; On the other hand M. Schaloigne says that Captain Fryatt said to him, &quot; L&apos;officier charge de ma defense m&apos;a fait 1&apos;impression de prendre la chose a coeur et de faire son possible.&quot; But in any case it seems clear that no opportunity was afforded to Captain Fryatt to consult with the officer detailed to defend him or to prepare his defeiice. Lastly, he had no opportunity of appealing.The Naval Chaplain Koene who was with Captain Fryatt up to the moment of his death, in a report to the American Ambassador, says the Court was a &quot; duly instituted [sic] Court Martial.&quot; Since the Armistice, however, statements have appeared in German papers which throw doubt on this state-ment. The Matin asserted that it had been stated in the Freiheit of 9th February last by an officer on the staff of Admiral von Schroeder that he took care that the Court-Martial which tried Captain Fryatt should be composed of submarine officers, and that he had given direction that Captain Fryatt should be condemned to death. This statement seems to have appeared also in a Berlin paper, the RepubliJc, and produced a &quot;rectification-tion &quot; from Kriegsgerichtsrat Zaepfel, who, as before stated, was President of the Court. The &quot;rectification&quot; was apparently issued in Berlin, and was sent from there to Wilhelmshaven, where it appeared in the Wilhelmshaven Tageblatt of February . 15th. From this statement it appears that the Court which tried Captain Fryatt was not a &quot; Corps Gericht des Marine Corps &quot; at all, but a Feldgericht. Zaepfel denies the assertion that submarine officers alone were members of the Court. He says that there was a Captain of a submarine, &quot; the remaining judges belonging to other branches of the service-Air (Service, Destroyer Flotilla and Land Forces.&quot; This is not the proper constitution of a Naval Court-Martial, and is not the Court by which the Berlin Foreign Office, no doubt upon information received from Bruges, informed Mr. Gerard that Captain Fryatt would be tried.1Why was this change made from a Corps Gericht to a Feld-gericht ? Bearing in mind that Admiral von Schroeder knew that the Beriin authorities wished to postpone &quot;the trial, that there, is an, appeal from a Naval Kriegsgericht and no appeal from a Feldgericht, the conclusion is irresistible that the Admiral had made up his mind, that Captain Fryatt should be shot out of hand after a parody of a trial had been held, the confirmation of whose sentence would be entirely in his discretion, and that he deliberately took steps to prevent the Berlin Foreign Office interfering,; as he doubtless.anticipated it would do. The state-ments which we think can be relied on that there was a telegraphic or telephonic request to postpone the execution shows that the AdmiraPs expectations were correct. A further question arises as to whether a Feldgericht would have any jurisdiction as&apos;to an&quot;i^1 By&apos;g&apos;! 54 of. the Militaratrafgerichtsordnung, 1898, a District Court-Martial may- be formed partly from members of the Army and partly from members of the Navy.
offence committed at sea, on which we cannot throw any light. Kriegsgerichtsrat Zaepfel&apos;s &quot;rectification&quot; throws further light on the attitude of the authorities at Bruges &quot; a death sentence,&quot; he says, &quot; must always be carried out immediately it is con-firmed.&quot; There was no need to confirm it in such haste, especially in view of the known attitude of Berlin. &quot; Only a petition for pardon,&quot; he proceeds, &quot; can justify the postpone-ment of punishment. Captain Fryatt, however, made no such petition, either when sentence was passed &quot; (he did not know the result of his trial when he got back to the prison) &quot; or when the order for confirmation was made known to him, or subse-quently, although he would have had sufficient time and oppor-tunity for doing so. When the order was communicated to him he was informed by vie that he might address a petition for pardon to the Emperor.&quot; The whole of the statements recently received from the Chief Commissary of Police, the Echevins and others, negative the idea that Captain Fryatt ever had an opportunity of presenting a petition for pardon to the Emperor. The mere facts that he was condemned at about 4 p.m., that the confirmation probably was given at about 5 p.m., and that he was taken from the prison soon after and shot at 6.30 or there-abouts, show that he had no real opportunity.Moreover, there is no evidence that Kriegsgerichtsrat Zaepfel 1 ever saw Captain Fryatt after he was sentenced, unless he was the tall pale officer who read out something in the hearing of the Echevins after Captain Fryatt was bound to the post on the place of execution.   This may have been the confirmation..The impression produced by the available evidence is that the whole proceedings were a parody of justice in the form of a trial to carry out a pre-determined resolution to put Captain Fryatt to death.It is not material to this report to refer at length to the indecency of the steps taken in carrying out the sentence, but the description of the young officers marching about smoking and apparently gibing at the condemned man, of the Colonel in charge of the execution, cigar in mouth and sporting dog at his heels,.of the firing party marching to and from the place of execution headed by a band, is simply revolting, and bears out the conclusion that the whole proceeding was in no sense the solemn infliction of a penalty, but rather a deliberate murder carried out light-heartedlyWe see no evidence at present on which to base a charge against the members of the Court. They may have been ill-advised by Kriegsgerichtsrat Zaepfel; it may have been that they were instructed, as the Freiheit and the Republik say, to condemn Captain Fryatt to death, and have acted on instructions without paying any attention to the evidence. At present, however, there is nothing to establish either, and the fact that the trial seems to have occupied most of the day does not suggest merely perfunctory compliance with the forms of the trial. But it should be demanded that the record of the proceedings should be handed over in order that they may be carefully examined.The other question, whether Captain Fryatt committed any offence either against International Law or tven against
German Law in attempting to ram the submarine on March 28th, 1915, must, we suggest, be answered in the negative.The official German statements issued on July 28th, 1916, said the accused was &quot; condemned to death because, although he was not a member of a combatant force, he made an attempt on the afternoon of March 28th, 1915, to ram the German Sub-marine 11.33 near the Maas Light Ship.&quot;Search has been made for any code of law which makes resistance-tance to visit and search a crime punishable by death or other-wise. The only regulation at all bearing on this point is con-tained in an order issued by the Chief of the German Admiralty on June 22nd, 1914, which is as follows:  Appendix to the Prize Regulations.Berlin, 22nd June, 1914.Gevman Naval Prize Regulations.Translation of an Ordinance published in the Reichs-GesetzblattNo. 50 of 1914.Order for the Officers Commanding Naval Forces and Com-nianders of Ships, as to their procedure on meeting Armed Merchant Ships in War.1. The exercise of the right of visit as well as .every attack on the part of an armed merchant ship upon a German or neutral merchant ship is considered an act of piracy. The crew is to be proceeded against in accordance with the regulations as to extraordinary martial law procedure.2, If an armed enemy merchant vessel offers armed resistance to the right of visit, search ,and capture, this is to be broken down by all means possible, The enemy Government is responsible for any damage thereby caused to the ship, cargo, and passengers. The crew are to be treated as prisoners of war. The passengers are to be liberated unless it is proved that they have taken part in the resistance. In the latter case, they are to be proceeded against in accordance with the extraordinary martial law procedure.By Command of His Majesty. (Signed)     V. Pohl.It is considered to be a legitimate inference from the termsof the Order that resistance by armed enemy merchant vessels to the right of visit and search is not an offence in law, and although the crew run the risk of their action they are to be treated as prisoners of war, although passengers who take part in the resistance-tance are to be proceeded against under Martial Law. It is probable that the charge of !being a &quot; Franctireur &quot; was invented for this occasion on analogy from the laws of war on land, inas-much as no previous case is known in which this charge has been brought in respect of operations at sea. So far as Inter-national Law is concerned, the accepted principle is believed to be that a merchant ship ,has the right to resist visit,or capture by an enemy warship.   In practice, the warning,gun\ was treated
us opening fire on the part of the warship. The question arises as to how far in the case of a submarine the old practice is applicable, but it is suggested that in view of the stage which the submarine war had reached, and of the orders issued by the German Admiralty before March 28th, 1915 (mentioned below), Captain Fryatt was justified in assuming that the submarine was about to sink his vessel. In November, 1914, two British,ships were sunk in the Channel, the crews having been given 10 minutes to leave the ship. On 30th January, 1915, a British ship was torpedoed without warning. On the 1st February, 1915, the British s.s. &quot; Oriole &quot; was sunk in the Channel without leaving a trace. On the same day the British Hospital Ship &quot; Asturias &quot; was attacked. In all twenty-two British ships had been tor-pedoed and sunk without warning. On the 4th February, 1915, the German Admiralty declared the waters round the British Isles to be a military area, and stated that all Allied Merchant Ships in these waters would be destroyed without guarantee for the safety of passengers and crew. The last-mentioned note must be considered as at least as much an indication of intention on the part of the submarine, as a warning shot under the old practice.7. The conclusions to be drawn from the above facts are as follows:  , (I) Captain Fryatts action on March 28th, 1915, was a legitimate exercise of the right of self-defence, given to the captains of merchant ships according to Inter-national Law.(2/ The Court constituted to try Captain Fryatt was not in accordance with the German regulations, and was therefore illegal according to German law.(3) The charge brought against Captain Fryatt was for an offence not known to International Law.(4) Captain Fryatt was purposely tried by a court from which there was no right of appeal, and was given no opportunity of appealing to the Emperor.(5) The person responsible is Admiral von Schroeder.8. It is possible and even probable both from the elaborate arrangements to capture the &quot; Brussels,&quot; and from the corre-spondence between Mr. Gerard and the German Foreign Office, that the trial and execution of Captain Fryatt was ordered by the highest Naval Authorities, but there is no evidence at present on this point.&quot;Witnesses:Mr. W. J. Hartnell.M. Vergaelen. jM. Alphonse Schaloigne.M. de Schepper.M. van Hoestersberghe.M. Rommel.Since the above memorandum was prepared statements have appeared in the press that the Commission sitting in Berlin to investigate accusations of breaches of International Law has
reported that the sentence passed on Captain Fryatt did not violate International Law, but expressed regret that the sentence had been earned ont so hastily, and also that Captain Persius, one of the ablest of the German writers on International Law, has denounced the finding of the Commission, and expressed his opinion that it is the duty of all honourable men to protest against the judgment as in the interests neither of humanity nor of the German people.Neither the actual findings of the Commission nor the documents and evidence ,on which it was based which were handed to M. Rappaert, the Dutch Minister have yet reached the Sub-Committee. It is possible that when received they may to some extent either modify or strengthen the conclusions which have been drawn from the evidence at present available.Further important material has also been received which con-firms the view expressed above as to the pre-determined resolution to put Captain Fryatt to death.A copy of the order to print the notice of his execution has been obtained. It is addressed to the Stadvervaltung and requires 2,000 copies of the annexed notice to be printed in German-Flemish and French on red paper. Proofs are to be sent as soon as possible. It is dated July 27, 1916,. and signed by Sponer von Bottelars, Adjutant. The authorities at the Stadvervaltung passed on the order to Barbiaux, who received it early on the 28th. On the 29th Von Bottlar, the Commandant gave an order to the Stadvervaltung to post the notice in 10 named districts.It is therefore established that on the actual day of the execu-tion the notice was ready to be sent to the printers and this in view of the official announcement in Berlin on the 28th suggests that it must have been prepared before-hand ready to be issued in both places. It would be well to obtain the German text of the official announcement in Berlin for the purposes of comparison  1 at present only an English version telegraphed from Amsterdam is available. A copy of the German original aent to the printers is with the papers.A report has now been received from Berlin of the proceedings of the German Commission which is enquiring into the alleged breaches of International Law which sat on the 1st April to enquire into the case of Captain Fryatt. The proceedings began with the reading of the official correspondence between the British and German Governments and other official statements. A pro-protocol of the proceedings at the trial and Fryatt&apos;s examination were read and the log book which had not been put in evidence at the trial though in the possession of the Germans. was pro-introduced and the entry read. The passage relating to the incident gave rise to a discussion as to whether it meant that Fryatt had tried to ram the submarine. Its exclusion from the trial is important because of this doubt as to the meaning. Zaepfael, who was witness at the enquiry told the Dutch Minister when asked why the log was not produced at that trial that &quot; Fryatt himself had declared that it contained no reference to the incident. Any-how it could not be found until a few days after the trial.&quot; The Captain of the TJ. boat was not called at the trial but gave
evidence before the Commission. He said he hoisted flags on his periscope signifying &quot; stop, or I will shoot.&quot; Fryatt and a seaman denied that they saw them. The Captain goes on to say that he was manoeuvring for position to discharge a torpedo which he had already in the tube, making it perfectly clear that his intention was to capture or sink the &quot; Brussels.&quot; In fact Fryatt had no guns or any other means of defence except by ramming.The report of Zaepfefs evidence is so important that it is set out in full.&quot; The next witness was the Gerichtsassessor, Dr. Zapfel, who was responsible for the legal procedure at the Court-Martial at Bruges on the 27th July, and was prosecuting counsel for the naval authorities during the trial there.He stated that the order to institute a Court-Martial was given by Admiral Schroder, that Major Naumann was appointed Counsel for the defence. Cross-examined he admitted that Naumann had asked for postponement of the trial on the grounds that he had not sufficient technical knowledge of seamanship nor sufficient knowledge of International Law to conduct the defence properly. No notice was taken of these objections. Cross-examined by members of the Commission, he admitted that the Foreign Office had wired and that the wire had been received on the day previous to the trial. The Foreign Office demanded on political grounds and on behalf of the American Ambassador in Berlin a postponement of the trial. The American Ambassador wished to choose a suitable defender for Fryatt as the points of International Law raised were of first importance. The military authorities in Bruges refused to take any notice of the Foreign Office telegram. Dr.&apos; Cohn, Herr Bernstein and Geheimrat Eckhardt of. the Foreign Office cross-examined the witness in turn. The witness declared emphatically and with considerable vehemence that he acted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Militarstrafgesetzbuch. He acted within the four corners of the Militarstrafgesetzbuch, &quot;In. my capacity as Gerichtsassessor, Ich kenne kein Auswartiges Amt.&quot; Prof. Schucking expressed astonishment and indignation at this remark. Witness then threw the responsibility on the autho-rities, the final responsibility being of course on the shoulders of Admiral Schroder. Asked why Fryatt did not appeal, the witness stated that the only appeal possible would have been to the Kaiser and would have taken the form of an appeal for mercy. In his opinion, either Fryatt was unwilling to appeal for mercy or felt that he was justly condemned. At any rate he did not appeal. Asked if he could have obtained a postponement had he demanded it in his capacity as Gerichtsassessor, he replied in the affirmative. He was of the opinion that a further postpone-ment for this purpose would have been refused by the military authorities on the ground that the witnesses subpcenaed were urgently required for military duties. Asked who produced the witnesses, he replied the Reichsmarineamt, Berlin, but the Marine Kemmando at Bruges declared that they could not be detained on account of military duties The trial took place on the 27th July between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., judgment was given at 4 p.m.   Two hours later the execution took place.   No grounds
were given by the Court-Martial for the verdict beyond the state-men t that it was in accordance with the Imperial Decree of 1900. The Court-Martiai consisted of four officers, two submarine officers, one officer of the torpedo arm and one of the marines.Asked who instituted the proceedings against Fryatt, he replied, &quot; The public praise in the English Press, the mention in Parliament of certain officers of the Mercantile Marine who had saved their ships when attacked by U. boats, amongst them Fryatt, and the presentation of a watch by the Admiralty, in conjunction with the report submitted by the Commander of U. 33, led the Authorities to institute the trial.&quot;From this evidence it is clear (1) that Zaepfel as Gerichts-assessor could have obtained a postponement of the trial and was fully aware of the Foreign Office desire that it should be post-poned, but treated the request with contempt; (2) that no&apos; notice, was taken of the request of the soldier officer detailed to defend Captain Fryatt. He seems to have made the request because he felt himself incompetent to conduct the case without time to prepare himself to defend a man for his life. The refusal of this request itself throws the greatest suspicion on the bona -fides of the proceedings.It is&quot; interesting to compare this evidence with the &quot;rectification-tion&quot; quoted in the report. Before the Commission, Zaepfel said the Court was composed of four officers, two submarine, officers, one officer of the destroyer arm, and one of the marines&apos;. In the &quot; rectification &quot; &quot; only one of the five military judges was i captain of a submarine. The remaining judges belonging to &apos;ther branches of the service, air service, destroyer flotilla and land forces.&quot; In the &quot;rectification&quot; &quot;Excellency von Schroeder . . . provided a lawyer for Fryatfs defence.&quot; Before the Commission it turned out that the &quot; lawyer &quot; was a military officer so conscious of his lack of knowledge of seaman-ship and law that he applied for an adjournment.In the &quot; rectification&quot; Zaepfel says that he personally informed Captain Fryatt that he could appeal to the Emperor for pardon.   He made no such statement before the Commission.Lastly, the reasons given by Zaepfel for holding the Court-Martial at all made it evident that it was intended to make the Court-Martial and subsequent execution of Captain Fryatt an answer to the approval of his action by the British and to show that the Germans would avenge themselves if ever they got such bold merchant captains into their power, and by so doing hoped to terrorise other seafaring men.Zaepfel takes credit for having exactly followed the instruction of the Militarstrafsgeriehtbuch. Whether he did so or not it is impossible to say until we have a. translation of that book and the full records of the trial. But it is to be observed that &quot; no grounds were given by the Court-Martial beyond the statement that &quot; it was in accordance with the Imperial Decree of 1900&quot; (not further identified!), no notice seems to have been taken of the Imperial Decree of June, 1914, set out in the text of the report.The Sub-Committee suggest that in addition to Admiral von Schroeder, Zaepfel should be put in preventive arrest in order to secure his attendance either as a witness at the trial of the Admiral or as himself an accused person.
SECOND INTERIM REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE FOR OFFENCES AT SEA.Since the First Interim Report presented to the Main Com-mittee on 7th January, 1919, your sub-Committee have held three meetings.A Special Committee consisting of Mr. C. A. Russell, Mr. Herbert F. Manisty and Captain Brandon have made an exhaustive investigation into the material in the possession of the Admiralty relating to the bombardments of British coast towns and places by the Naval Forces of Germany; the use of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines by Germany; and the responsibility of the German. Imperial Chancellor, Herr Yon Bethman Hollweg, for the German Submarine Warfare against commerce.Upon these cases the Special Committee submitted to your Sub-Committee three separate Reports, which have all been received and adopted by your Sub-Committee.The first, entitled &quot; Report on Bombardments of British Coast Towns and Places by the Naval Forces of Germany,&quot; was pre-sented to the Main Committee on 11th February, 1919, and was adopted by them on that date.Tour Sub-Committee now present the second Report, entitled lt Report on the Use of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines by Germany,&quot; and the third Report, entitled &quot;Responsibility of the German Imperial Chancellor for Submarine Warfare against Commerce.&quot;Your Sub-Committee have also considered the question of the detention of British Merchant Seamen by Germany as prisoners of war. A memorandum on this question, submitted by Mr. T. W. H. Inskip, K.C., was considered, and the Sub-Com-mittee also heard a statement on the same subject by Captain W. A. Willett, representing the Mercantile Marine Service Asso-ciation. In view of the facts stated and arguments advanced in this Memorandum and of Captain Willett&apos;s statement, your Sub-Committee adopted Mr. Inskip&apos;s conclusions with which Captain Willett concurred; and your Sub-Committee recommend that no action be taken in regard to this matter.In regard to the treatment of British Merchant Officers and Seamen as prisoners of war in Germany, your Sub-Committee heard the expressions of opinion by Captain Willett, and examined the statement made by Captain Rudd relating to the treatment of British Officers of the Mercantile Marine captured by the German raider &quot;S.iS. Wolf.&quot;In the circumstances, your Sub-Committee decided to refer these matters to the Sub-Committee for Offences on Land.At the request of the Law Officers the Special Committee pre-pared a number of cases against accused persons, containing particulars of the official capacity in which they acted, the charges to be preferred against them, and the general nature of the evidence in possession of the Sub-Committee.   These cases
were forwarded to the Law Officers according to their directions from time to time without waiting for presentation to the Main Committee.Nineteen cases were those of persons considered responsible for the bombardment of the English Coast on the lGth December, 1914.Seventeen cases were those of persons considered responsible for the inception and conduct of Submarine Warfare by Germany.Twenty-four cases were those of Captains of Submarines who are believed to have acted with exceptional callousness or brutality.Eight cases were those of persons considered responsible for the laying of mines as a weapon against commerce; and two cases were those of persons in high command responsible for directing or authorising the laying of mines in areas frequented by mercantile traffic.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee.(Signed)     JOHN MACDO.NELL,Chairman.HUGH H. L. BELLOT,Secretary.27th March, 1919.Bombardments op British Coast Towns and Places by the Naval Forces op Germany.During the war the coasts of Great Britain were bombarded by the Naval Forces of Germany on 15 occasions, of which the earliest was the 3rd November, 1914, and the latest the 15th May, 1918. In reckoning the number of these bombardments, the naval action off Yarmouth on 3rd November, 1914, has been included, as, although no shell fell above high water mark, it seems probable that a number of the rounds fired were deliberately aimed at the town.The towns and places against which the bombardments were directed were Seaham; Hartlepool and West Hartlepool; Whitby; Scarborough; Lowestoft; Yarmouth; Southwold; Mar-gate, Broadstairs; Ramsgate; Dover; the Harrington Works at Lowca; Walney Island; and St. Eilda. Yarmouth was attacked three times; and Scarborough, Ramsgate and District, and Dover and District each twice.On three occasions, namely, 3rd November, 1914 (Yarmouth); 16th December, 1914 (the HartlepooTs, Scarborough and Whitby); and 24th/25th April, 1916 (Lowestoft and Yarmouth),, the hostile operations were carried out by squadrons of the High Sea Fleet, consisting of battle cruisers and cruisers accompanied by deetroyers, and on the occasion of the attack on Lowestoft and
Yarmouth accompanied by Zeppelins also. The attacks oh Walney Island (29th January, 1915); on the Harrington Works (16th August, 1915); on Seaham; the second attack on Scar-borough (4th September, 1917); and the attack on St. Kilda (15th May, 19.18), were made by submarines.On all the other occasions (viz., 25th January, 25th February, 17th/18th March, 20th/21st April, and 26th/27th April, 1917, and 14th January and 15ih/16th February, 1918), destroyers only were employed.The total casualties caused by these bombardments were:   Naval and Military, 15 killed and 20 injured; Civilian, 158 killed and 611 injured. The value of the damage done to civilian property was about  100,000.In April, 1918, histories of all these bombardments, with the exception of the second attack on Dover on 15th/16th February, 1918, and the attack on St. Kilda on 15th May of that year, were prepared by the Intelligence Section, General Headquarters, Home Forces. Similar histories of the second attack on Dover and the attack on St. Kilda were subsequently prepared. These histories contain, with respect to each of the 15 naval raids above mentioned, (i) information, where available, as to the composi-tion of the attacking naval force; (ii) a description of the place or places attacked, specifying (among other things) the nature of its defences (if any), and what (if any) military works, or military or naval establishments, or depots of arms or war material, or workshops or plant that could be utilised for the need of the Fleet or Army, were there situate; (iii) a narrative of the bombardments; (iv) expert observations as to the objects at which the enemy&apos;s fire was probably directed, whether success-fully or not; and (v) a statement of the casualties caused and the material damage done, with details as to the character and location of the buildings struck. The histories are illustrated by maps, on which are indicated the position and movements of the attacking forces, the extent of the area affected by the bombardment, and the positions of the places struck by shells.All these histories and maps were produced to the Sub-Committee at the Horse Guards on 6th inst. by Lieut.-Col. de Watteville, and your Sub-Committee went through them with him, and had the benefit of his supplementary observations and explanations.With this information before them your Sub-Committee have carefully considered all the circumstances of each bombardment, including: the character of the place bombarded; the extent to which the enemy&apos;s fire was probably directed to the destruction of military defences or military or naval works or establishments, etc.; whether (haying regard to the fact that in.no case was the bombardment preceded by any summons or notice) there would be plausible ground for an allegation that immediate action was necessary and that no delay could be allowed con-sistently with the safety of the attacking force*; and the* For instance, it is said that after the attack on the Hartlepools aud Scarborough the enemy only escaped being cut off and surrounded on their way home by the main British Fleet owing to thick and squally weather.
247existence of evidence by which responsibility for ordering the bombardment or carrying it out could be brought home to particular officers, or by which particular ships could be shown to have participated in it.Your Sub-Committee do not doubt that one of the objects of the majority of the raids was to terrorise the inhabitants of the East Coast and Kent Coast towns, and to create the impression that the British had not the control of the North Sea; and it is true that their military effect was insignificant. But the full histories of these raids show that there was more military justification for certain of them than one would infer from the statements contained in the British Official communiques issued with respect to them.Your Sub-Committee have come to the conclusion that it is desirable that the bombardment of Scarborough, Whitby and West Hartlepool on the 16th December, 1914, should be made the subject of a charge before the Tribunal.There is primd facie evidence to show that the Squadron which carried out the bombardment of 16th December, 1914, was com-posed of the 1st and 2nd Scouting Groups of the High Sea Eleet, consisting of the following vessels:  Battle Cruisers- &quot;Derfflinger,&quot;   &quot;iSeydlitz,&quot;   &quot;Moltke,&quot;   &quot;Yon  der Tann.&quot; Cruiser-&quot;Blucher.&quot;Light Cruisers &quot;Rostock,&quot; &quot;Giaudenz,&quot; &quot; Stralsund,&quot; &quot;Strassburg,&quot; &quot; Kolberg,&quot; together with several flotillas of torpedo boat destroyers.The evidence indicates that the &quot; Derfflinger &quot; and &quot; Kolberg&quot; did not actually take part in the bombardment, and that the remaining vessels, on approaching the British coast, formed1 two Divisions, one of which bombarded Scarborough and Whitby and the other the two Hartlepools. The precise composition of these two Divisions has not been satisfactorily ascertained, and there is some conflict of evidence on the point.In the opinion of your Sub-Committee it would, therefore, be better that a general charge covering these three separate bom-bardments should be formulated.Scarborough possessed no fixed defence. It contained a Coast Guard Station and some disused barracks, and, in the suburb of Falsgrave, a Wireless Telegraph Station, but nothing else that could be described as a military work or a work of military or naval utility.The bombardment was carried out probably by battle cruisers together with light cruisers. They opened fire at a range of about 1,000 yards from the pier* on the Coast Guard Station and&apos;&apos; * It is almost incredible that the bombarding vessels would have approached &apos; so close inshore if they had believed that Scarborough was fortified as stated in their communiques,
barracks and wrecked both, buildings; and though they failed to damage the Wireless Telegraph Station, it would seem that at one time their fire was directed at it; but in the main the bom-bombardment was a wanton and recklessly indiscriminate shelling of the town from end to end. (Seventeen civilians were killed and 120 injured, and the value of the material damage done to civilian buildings was about!  30,000.The bombardment of Scarborough lasted from 8.0 a.m. to 8.30 a.m., and about half an hour later the ships by which it had been carried out appeared off Whitby. Whitby, like Scar-borough, had no fixed defence. The attacking force opened fire at a range of about 2 miles. The Port War Signal Station and Coast Guard Station were damaged. The Abbey was struck by two or three shells. But the most serious damage was in the district immediaely at the back of East Cliff. The casualties were few, fortunately, but the material damage to civilian property amounted in value to about  10,000.Simultaneously with the bombardment of Scarborough, and as part of the same operations, Hartlepool and West Hartlepool were shelled by the cruiser &quot; Blucher&quot; and other vessels. Hartlepool was a defended port; the land batteries there and a small naval flotilla consisting of 2 scouts and 4 destroyers gave a good account of themselves; and, so far as the bombardment was directed against Hartlepool, your Sub-Committee do not recommend that any proceedings in respect of it should be instituted. But the bombardment of West Hartlepool stands on a different footing.West Hartlepool had no fixed defences, and the bombardment of the town seems to have been quite indiscriminate. Fifty-six civilians were killed or subsequently died of injuries, and 222 were more or less seriously injured; and 506 houses and a number of churches and schools were damaged.Your Sub-Committee understand that a feature of almost every naval engagement during the war has been the accurate range-taking and good fire discipline of the Germans so long as they were not being hit. It cannot be assumed, therefore, that the promiscuous distribution of fire by which these bombardments of 16th December, 1914, were characterised was unavoidable or even unintentional.With regard to the other coast bombardments, your Sub-Committee have come to the conclusion that owing either to the . character of the place bombarded or to the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence it is not desirable that proceedings should be instituted in respect of any of them.Your Sub-Committee have considered whether in the proceed-ings they have recommended Convention No. IX. of the Hague Conventions, 1907 (&quot;Concerning Bombardments by Naval Forces in Time of War&quot;), would be held to have been binding on the accused. They are of the opinion that it would not. The Convention contains the usual provision that it is not to apply &quot;except between Contracting Powers,&quot; and then only if all the belligerents are parties to the Convention.   Even at the date of
the earliest raid all the then belligerents were not parties to the Convention. The Convention was not ratified by Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Serbia or Turkey.Serbia was one of the belligerents before the 3rd November, 1914, and a state of war was declared between Great Britain and Turkey on the 5th November, 1914.But your Sub-Committee regard Convention IX. of 1907 as being, in the main, declaratory of the laws and usages of war then already recognised; and the conclusions to which they have come have not been affected by the fact that the Convention may not be applicable.Appended to this report is a list in which are named and designated the officers against whom, in the opinion of your Sub-Committee, proceedings might properly be taken in respect of the bombardment of Scarborough, Whitby and West Hartlepool.The Chief of the Admiralty Staff would have been included in the list, but Admiral von Pohl, who held that position in December, 1914, is dead. The Commander-in-Ohief of the High Sea Fleet is included because the bombardment formed part of a big operation, in which the greater part of the High Sea Fleet participated, and the Admiral Commanding the bombarding Squadron would have acted under the immediate orders of the Commander-in-Chief. The Chief Gunnery Officer of each ship is included because he would be responsible for directing and dis-tributing the fire of the guns. The officer who was in command of the &quot;Blucher&quot; in December, 1914, is dead, as is also the Chief Gunnery Officer of the &quot; Stralsund &quot;; and the iSub-Com-mittee have not included in the list the Commanders of the &quot; Derfflinger &quot; and &quot; Kolberg,&quot; as those ships appear not to have taken part in the bombardment but to have been engaged in minelaying.It is very desirable that any written orders in regard to the bombardment that were issued by the Admiral Staff, by the Commander-in-Chief of the High Sea Fleet, or by the Admiral Commanding the bombarding Squadron, and any official reports that were made regarding the bombardment should be obtained.Tour Sub-Committee recommend:  That the Government take at the earliest possible moment the necessary steps (i) to secure the arrest or preventive detention and surrender of the persons named or designated in the Appendix hereto; (ii) to obtain production and delivery of all written orders issued by the Admiral Staff, the Commander-in-Chief of the High Sea Fleet, and the Admiral Commanding the bombarding Squadron, and all German official reports, relating to the bombardment: of the East Coast of England on December 16, 1914.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed) JOHN MACDONELL.January 16th, 1919,
Appendix.Column I. contains the designation of the Officers whom your Sub-Committee regard as having held positions which involved responsibility- for the bombardment of the English coast on 16th December, 1914.Column II. contains the names of the officers believed to havt held those positions on that date.It is suggested that the demand for arrest and surrender should take the form of, e.g., &quot; Kontreadmiral Tapken or other the officer second-in-command of the squadron by which Scar-borough, Whitby and West Hartlepool were bombarded on 16th December, 1914,&quot; or &quot; Korvettenkapitan Schinnacher or other the chief gunnery officer of the battle cruiser Moltke on 16th December, 1914.&quot;(The names contained in this Appendix were forwarded to H.M.

A. Russell, Mr. H. F. Manisty, and Captain Brandon. Under the terms of the Armistice, the Germans delivered to the British Govern-ment charts and documents indicating the positions and character of all the minefields which they had laid and the number of mines contained in each. The Special Committee examined these so far as they related to minefields in the North Sea and in other waters adjacent to the British Isles, to minefields in the approaches to the White Sea, and to minefields laid by the raider &quot; Wolf &quot;; they had before them further information with regard to these minefields obtained by the British Admiralty: and they were supplied with statistics of the merchant and fishing vessels destroyed by mines and of the lives of non-combatants thereby lost. It would appear, from the Secret Mining Regu-lations issued by the German Admiral Staff about 1912, that the. professed pre-war intention of the Germans was that mining operations should be carried out solely against armed! forces and not against mercantile traffic, and that mines should be laid as far as possible off the principal trade routes. But from the position in which the minefields were laid, from the indiscrimi-nate destruction wrought by them, and from the fact that they were laid without any precautions being taken for the security of shipping or the safety of non-combatants, the Special Committee came to the conclusion that during the war the.prin-cipal object of the German mining operations, as a whole, was to obstruct trade routes, and to destroy such merchant shipping as should persist in. using them; that, in fact, at any rate in the latter part of the war, mines were used by the Germans together with submarines as instruments by which they sought to carry out their organised and deliberate &quot; war upon com-Hierce.&quot; Tour Sub-Committee see no reason to differ from this conclusion.   In their opinion it is confirmed by statements to
be found in German official documents and announcements of which the following extracts may serve as examples :  1.

4. Extracts from German Official Announcements.&quot; Berlin, 13th April. During the month of March, 1916, 80 enemy merchant vessels, with an approximate gross tonnage of 207,000, were sunk by German submarines .   or lost through mines.&quot; &apos;  &apos;&quot; Berlin, 14th May. The submarine successes in the month of April were: 96 enemy merchant vessels, with an approximate gross tonnage of 225,000, sunk by German and Austro-Hungarian submarines or lost through mines.&quot;&quot; Berlin, 12th July. During the month of June, 61 enemy merchant vessels, with an approximate gross ton-nage of 101,000, were sunk by submarines of the Central Powers or lost through mines.&quot;&quot; Berlin, 17th September. During August, 126 enemy merchant vessels, totalling 170,779 tons gross, were sunk by submarines of the Central Powers or by mines. Fur-ther, 35 neutral merchant vessels, totalling 38,568 tons gross, were sunk on account of their carrying contraband to the enemy.&quot;&quot; Berlin, 21st November.   During the month of October, 146 enemy merchant vessels, totalling 306,500 tons gross, were captured or sunk by submarines and tor-torpedo craft of the Central Powers or lost through mines; further, 72 neutral merchant vessels, totalling 87,000 tons gross, were sunk on account of their carrying contraband to the enemy.....&quot;1 In the course of the war (to 1.1th November, 1918) at least 258 British merchant vessels, totalling 620,945 tons gross, and 61 British fishing vessels, totalling 8,191 tons gross, were sunk by mines; 1,782 non-combatants losing their lives thereby; in addition, at least, 83 British merchant vessels were damaged by mines but not sunk, whereby 64 non-combatants lost their lives.Mines further accounted for at least 52 Allied merchant vessels and 190 neutral merchant vessels, with a total gross tonnage of 122,02.1 and 303,081 respectively; figures of the loss of life in these cases are not available. The total gross tonnage of shipping destroyed by mines was thus at least 1,058,238, and the total loss of life very heavy; but the Committee are satisfied that, but for the remarkably efficient organisation and devoted work of our Minesweeping Service, assisted on the one hand by an admirable system of Naval Intelligence, and on the other hand by adequate arrangements for warning and diverting merchant shipping, the losses would have been immensely heavier. And in spite of every precaution being taken, merchant vessels, neutral as well as Allied, are at the present time (March, 1919) still striking mines at the rate of about three or four a week, in many cases with serious loss of life.In the opinion of the Committee, the German use of mines during the war was contrary alike to the principles of the laws and usages of Naval Warfare and to the laws of humanity; and they think it would be proper that its legitimacy should be chal-lenged fey proceedings being instituted in respect of it,
In order that the strength and real nature of the case of Great Britain and her Allies against the German use of mines may he effectively presented, the proceedings should he so framed that it would he relevant to put in evidence the principal facts with regard to the laying of minefields generally, and with regard to the system of which they formed part.That this may be done, the persons charged must include those responsible for the initiation and prosecution of the German policy of war upon commerce.   The Committee have named in, the First Schedule hereto those upon whom they think this re-sponsibility rests.They would point out that with one exception these names already appear in List 1 appended to the Interim Report of the Sub-Committee dealing with Offences at Sea adopted by the Main Committee on 7th January, 1919.Minelaying schemes and regulations were prepared by the German Admiral Staff about the year 1912. . The regulations contain the following statement:  ......The Conventions of the Second Hague Con-ference (A. VIII.) have found far-reaching consideration as regards the choice of areas in which it is intended to lay mines. Therefore provisions are made in the mine-laying schemes* only for naval harbours or for harbours in which military arsenals or shipbuilding and repairing establishments are to be found, or for harbours that are likely to become ports of embarkation and disembarkation of English troops for the Continent.t Thus the principle is that mining operations will he carried out solely against armed forces, and not against mercantile traffic. Accordingly the boundaries of the area in which mines will be laid, marked on the enclosed maps by black lines, are as far as possible off the principal trade routes and in general are selected not further than ten nautical miles from the harbours which are to be closed. No mines may be laid outside the limits shown in the enclosures.The areas marked on the maps referring to the British Isles included areas (a) off the coast between Harwich and Orfordness, (6) off the coast between Lowestoft and Winterton, (c) off the mouth of the River Humber, (d) off the mouth of the River Tyne, and (e) barring the entrance to Lough Swilly, and in the months of August, October, November and December, 1914, mines were laid in these neighbourhoods, and also off Scar-borough. But in every case the mines were laid outside the limits shown on the maps and in positions much more dangerous to mercantile traffic, whilst in the case of the mines off Scar-borough they had no apparent relation to any of the minefields authorized by the regulations. If these departures from the directions contained in the regulations were not authorized by new orders from the German Admiralty, but were the acts, either deliberate or reckless, of the commanders of the vessels by which the mines were laid, the Sub-Committee are of opinion that* A copy of these has been obtained, f Italics as in original.
proceedings might properly be instituted against such com-manders. Their names will be found in the Second Schedule hereto.On 4th February, 1915, the German Admiral Staff issued a proclamation declaring the waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland to be a war zone; and in a Note addressed by the German Minister for Foreign Affairs to the American Ambas-ambassador on 16th February, .1915, it was stated that the German Admiralty would obstruct this area by mine wherever possible. The Committee are not aware whether a similar intimation as to the obstruction of this area by mines was given to other Neutrals, but in any case the notification did not apply to any area outside the so-called war zone.About the beginning of December, 1916, S.M.S. &quot; Wolf &quot; succeeded in passing through the British patrols in the North Sea and commenced a cruise of commerce-raiding and minelaying that lasted for more than a year. The Commanding Officer of the &quot; Wolf &quot; published an account of this cruise. The following extracts from his narrative show the nature of these minelaying operations and make it clear that their express purpose was to destroy merchant shipping regardless of character or nationality or of the safety of non-combatants: -&quot; South Africa was reached on 16th January, 1916. . . On that very evening we laid some ^infernal machines &apos; which were to cause great pain to any ship that might strike them. The crew had waited long for us to cast off our inactivity. Now at last they had their wish. We worked in all the waters through which we passed, and in. which there was much steamer traffic at the time. Occasionally, we had to get out of the way of ships, so as not to betray our-selves at the beginning of our operations. It would not have been pleasant to have been obliged to witness the effect of our mines on a passenger ship, but we were fortunate; when a ship struck one of our mines we were always at least out of sight. Having completed our work off the South African coast, we continued the cruise into the Indian Ocean.&quot;&quot; We were off Ceylon about the middle of February. In different parts of the Indian Ocean mines were laid, whose effect was soon noted, particularly off Bombay and Colombo.&quot;&quot; From all parts, from all places came reports of the losses of ships. We had continued out operations in the Tasman Sea, and had laid mines in several places.&quot;&quot; It was interesting, too, to see for how long a time ships continued to strike our mines. It was on the night of 26th January, 1917, that we learned for the first time that our mines off Cape Town had begun to take effect. We received reliable information that in September that is nearly nine months later-ships were still meeting with these &apos; infernal machines,1 and being sunk by them. The first losses off Bombay occurred on 20th February, and the last certain one in July. We have other reasons for believing that at a much later date, off Colombo and other places, ships were
still coming to grief on our mines; we now know that in November losses were still occurring in the Tasman Sea; and on arriving home we received a paper in which we read of a recent statement in the Australian Parliament to the effect that a large - number of ships had fallen victims to mines in Australian waters.&quot;&quot; At the beginning of September we went through the .   . Dutch islands near Singapore to lay mines again.&quot;The mines referred to in this last extract were laid somewhat to the north of the Anamba Islands in a long line stretching across the trade routes from Singapore to Hong Kong and Manila.Your Sub-Committee are of opinion that it would be proper that proceedings should be instituted against the Commanding Officer of the &quot; &quot;Wolf,&quot; and they have included his name in the Second Schedule hereto.Your Sub-Committee recommend:  That the Government take at the earliest possible moment the necessary steps to secure the arrest or preventive detention and surrender of the persons named or designated in the First and Second Schedules hereto, with a, view to proceedings being taken against them for breaches of the laws of war and of humanity.The Main Committee has already recommended that the enemy Governments be required to deliver up (among other things) all orders issued to submarines. We consider it desirable that when this is done orders or instructions to submarines with regard to the laying of mines, together with all orders to surface vessels on the ame subject, should be specifically demanded.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed) JOHN MACDONELL.Hugh H.

mResponsibility of the German Imperial Chancellor for Submarine Warfare against Commerce.By reason of the attitude of the Neutral Countries, and especially-cially of the United States, the mode in which submarine war-fare against commerce should be waged by the Germans, and the extent to which it should be pushed, became^ almost from the first, as much a political as a military question. No one can read) the diplomatic correspondence between the United States and Germany in 1915 and 1916 (now published in a con-venient form by the Oxford University Press, American branch, edited by James Brown Scott) without seeing this; and it is clear from the statements made of 31st January, 1917, by the then Imperial Chancellor, Herr von Bethmann Hollweg, in addressing the Main Committee of the Reichstag, that the deci-sion whether unrestricted submarine warfare should be adopted rested with him.In the course of his speech* he said, for instance:  As Members of the Reichstag will recollect, the question of submarine warfare has occupied us three times in this Committee, namely, in March, May and September, last year. On each occasion, an an exhaustive statement, I ex-pounded the pros and cons of the question. I laid stress on the fact that on each occasion I was speaking pro tempore, and not as a supporter in principle, or an opponent in principle, of the unrestricted employment of submarines, but in view of the military, political and economic situation as a whole, always starting from an examination of the quejstion whether unrestricted submarine warfare woluld bring us nearer to a victorious peace or not.&quot;Any measures,&quot; I said in March, &quot;which are caleu-lated to shorten the war are the most humane.&quot; &quot; Even the must ruthless measures which would lead us to victory, and to a swift victory,&quot; I said at that time, &quot; must be employed.&quot;Herr von Bethmann Hollweg then proceeded to explain why, in March and May of the preceding year, he had opposed unrestricted-tricted submarine warfare, and why again in September, accord-ing to the unanimous judgment of the political and military authorities, the question was not considered ripe for decision.In this connection he recalled the fact that on a former occa-sion he had said: &quot; As soon as, in agreement with the Supreme Command of the Army, I become convinced that unrestricted submarine warfare will bring us nearer to peace, unrestricted warfare will be commenced.&quot;He then continued:This moment has now arrived. Last autumn the time was not yet ripe, but now the moment has come when we can venture on this undertaking with the greatest prospect of success.* A. report of the speech will be found in the &quot; Times,&quot; 2nd Feb., 1917,
Herr von Bethmann Hollweg in the speech above quoted took the political responsibility for unrestricted submarine warfare, but we think in view of the expressions he used he may have merely been the mouthpiece of the Military and Naval High Command, after he had used his influence as far as possible against the proposal. In these circumstances we are not pre-pared to state that in our opinion the name of Herr von Beth-mann Hollweg should be included amongst those whose surrender should be demanded but we submit the facts for the consideration of the Law Officers of the Crown.Signed on behalf of the Committee,(Signed)     .    JOHN MACDONELL,Hugh H. L. Bellot,J. E. G. de Montmorency,Secretaries. ^6th May, 1919.Report on the Detention op British Merchant Seamen byGermany..1. The question of the detention of officers and men of the Mer-cantile Marine has to be be considered in connection with the various agreements made from time, to time for the exchange of prisoners. It has also to be considered in the light of the right of the belligerents to retain, as prisoners, civilians of military age. With regard to the latter point a different age limit was taken by the various powers from time to time. As is well known, the British age limit for military service rose as the demands on available man-power increased. At a com-paratively early stage in the war Austria took all men up to the age of 55; Germany never went so far as this, and for the pur-pose of agreements made with the Allies for the exchange of prisoners 45 was in general accepted as the limit. In spite, however, of a limit of this nature, it was always contended by His Majesty&apos;s Government that they were at liberty to retain civilians, whether of military age or not, whose detention might be considered desirable &quot; for military reasons.&quot; On this ground numbers of civilians were retained by His Majesty&apos;s Government who were certainly incapable, by reason of their age, of military service in the- field. It appears to be impossible to contend that Germany was precluded from adopting the same lines of argument as His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. An agreement which was made for the exchange of ships5 officers and seamen and merchant seamen, is summarised in a note to the Foreign Office of 9th August, 1916; this agreement came into force on January 2nd, 1917, and the agreement was to20963
exchange all civilians over 45, including ships&apos; officers and merchant seamen. For obvious reasons the agreement only had a retrospective effect and did not cover the cases of civilians taken after January 2nd, 1917. Up till the date of this agree-ment the only arrangement in force was for the exchange of ships&apos; boys under 17 and seamen over 55. At the date of the agree-ment above mentioned for the exchange of civilians over 45, there were a large number of officers and men of merchant ships, in-cluding fishing boats, at Ruhleben. After the agreement was made, however, but before January 2nd, 1917, when it became operative, 101 officers and men and boys were removed from Ruh-leben (a civilian camp) to Brandenburg (a military camp) on the ground that they were &quot;of the standing of military pri-soners.&quot; These men were prisoners from such ships as the &quot;Brussels,&quot; &quot; Westburn,&quot; &quot;Colchester,&quot; and &quot;Saxon Prince;&quot; these were unarmed vessels. At a subsequent stage large numbers of officers and men of the Mercantile Marine were sent to military camps, presumably on the same ground, and a report was made by the Master of the &quot; Jevington &quot; (sunk January 23rd, 1917) that he was informed on being taken prisoner that orders had been issued for the capture of all Masters of British ships for the express purpose of their detention as prisoners of war. It is also to be observed that as time went on the officers and men who were captured, mostly by submarines, were taken from defensively armed ships. As soon as information was received as to the transfer of prisoners from Ruhleben to Brandenburg, the Imperial Merchant Service Guild requested the Foreign Office to ask if the officers sent from Ruhleben were being treated in the Military camps as Officers. This question led to a great deal of correspondence and contro-versy, and eventually arrangements were made for paying the Officers and men in Military camps, in order that they might maintain themselves according to their rank. This question, however, is quite distinct from the question of the illegality of their detention as prisoners.3. On January 2nd, 1917, there were 80 Mercantile Captains alone over 45 who were being treated as prisoners of war. Apart from the question as to their status they were clearly entitled to be released under the new agreement, which expressly included Merchant Officers and seamen. Germany, however, obstinately determined to treat them as Military prisoners of war and the question of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government naturally became a burning one. The Imperial Merchant Service Guild made frequent appeals to the newly constituted Prisoners-of-War Department or to the Admiralty to take steps to obtain the release of the more senior of these prisoners, either on the ground that they were incapable of Military Service and were, in fact, invalids, or on the ground that they were entitled to be released under either one or the other of the agreements in force. The Admiralty took the view that Germany could only be forced to depart from her position by something in the nature of reprisals. The P.W.D, immediately assented to the proposal that no
German Officers or seamen should be released until our men were released, but Lord Newton always declined to inform the German Government of this decision. The attitude of the P.W.D. was expressed in a communication to the Admiralty in September, .1917, wherein it was stated that until Germany deemed the crews of Defensively Armed Merchant Ships to be civilians they could not be charged with committing any breach of the agreement for the release of Merchant seamen over 45.4. It is unnecessary to set out in detail the difference of , opinion between the Admiralty and the P.W.D. as to the steps which should be taken to induce or compel Germany to act up to their agreement of January 2nd, 1917, or at any rate to release the more aged representatives of the Merchant Service, such as the Captain and Chief Engineer of the &quot; Yarrowdale,&quot; who were 64 and 60 years of age respectively and were in very bad health. In fact, down to a comparatively late date in 1918 no merchant Officers or seamen were released, except in cases of severe illness, and there was certainly nothing in the nature of a general exchange.5. It is not considered possible to assert that Germany com-mit/ted any breach of International Law or of the Usages of War in detaining these men. They were in many cases of Military age, even according to British standards. The Germans were also entitled to detain them &quot; for Military reasons,&quot; as being persons without whom the Mercantile Marine could not be properly carried on, and one effect of their detention was certainly to cause a shortage of Senior Officers in the Merchant Service. Another ground on which it was said that Germany was entitled to retain these men was that they belonged to Defensively Armed Ships and were, therefore, members of the Armed Forces of the Crown. The strength of the British case in calling for their release depended on the agreements which had been made. There is no doubt that Germany committed a breach of these agree-ments which were made during the war. Whether or not this amounts to a breach of the Laws of War is a matter for consideration.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed) JOHN MACDONELL.Hugh H. L.

SECOND INTERIM REPORT OE THE SUB-COMMITTEE FOR OFFENCES IN THE AIR.Since the First Interim Report presented to the Main Com-mittee on 7th January, 1919, your Sub-Committee have held two Sub-Committee and four Special Committee meetings, at which the cases contained in this Report were fully and carefully in-vestigated.Part I. of this Report, dealing with the Airship Raids over Great Britain, was presented to the Main Committee on the 11th February, 19.19, and received and adopted.Part III. of this Report, dealing with the Aeroplane Raid of 31st May 1st June, 1918, on Etaples, was also presented to the Main Committee on the 11th February, 1919, and referred back to your Sub-Committee for further investigation, with leave to bring the case again before the Main Committee&apos;, if they should think fit.Your Sub-Committee now present Part II. of this Report, dealing with some of the Aeroplane Raids over Great Britain during the years 1917 and 1918. Those raids only have been selected which, in the opinion of the majority of your Sub-Committee, shew indiscriminate attacks without any definite specific military objective; the main, if not the only, object being to affect the morale of the civil population by causing wide-spread loss of life and injury to the person, and destruction of civilian property.These cases have been selected and are presented in order to obtain the opinion of the Main Committee upon the lawfulness or otherwise of raids of this character, and to obtain a direction, in point of law, for the guidance of your Sub-Committee in any further investigations to be made by them.It will be seen from the memoranda attached to the Sub-Committee^ Report that some members of the Sub-Committee dissent from the conclusions reached by the majority.PART I.Airship Raids over Great Britain.Your Sub-Committee presented an Interim Report on the 7th January last, and appended to the Report a list of names of enemy airmen against whom, in their opinion, a prima facie case was shown of indiscriminate bombardment of towns and places in Great Britain without any military objective.Your Sub-Committee have examined further information in respect of the cases against these enemy airmen, which are numbered 1 to 3 in the list appended hereto.There appears to be satisfactory prima facie evidence of the identity of the respective airships and of the commanders who are referred tc in cases 1, 2 and 3.Nos. 1 to 3 are cases of attacks made by airships on London and other parts of Great Britain. The attacks mentioned in Part II. were made by aeroplanes.
The first three attacks met with no opposition. In the sub-sequent attacks following these, the methods of defence for a time were in their infancy, and consequently the enemy airmen were enabled in attacking to make their observations and to direct their aim with deliberation.Case No. .1. This airman conducted three raids, viz., first Southern!, 10th and 26th May, .1915, and London, 31st May, 1915. These attacks were all by night, and that of the 31st May in clear atmosphere and full moon. On the raid of 10th May, the airship dropped 90 incendiary bombs and some H.E. bombs on the town, killing one woman and injuring one man. During this raid the following message was dropped from the airship, written on a piece of carboard in blue pencil: &quot; You English. We have come and will come again soon. Kill or cure.    German.&quot;On the raid of 26th May, the same airship dropped 23 H.E. grenades and 47 incendiary bombs, killing two women and injuring one child.These two raids were apparently reconnaissance with a view to an attack on London.The raid of 31st May was the first attack on London. The parts attacked were occupied by purely civilian inhabitants, and included Shoreditch, Whitechapel and the Kingsland Road. There were no military objectives in the vicinity of the parts attacked. The regularity with which the bombs were dropped along the course of the Kingsland Road clearly indicated this airman&apos;s objective. The total number of bombs dropped were 30 H.E. grenades and 89 incendiary bombs. The former weigh 5 lb. each, and are adapted and intended to be used solely for man-killing purposes. The casualties included seven civilians killed and 33 injured.Case No. 2. This airman conducted two raids (in addition to several airship attacks of later dates), one on Hull the 5th March, 1916, and one on Edinburgh, 2nd April, 1916.The method of attack on Hull shows that the objective wat the civilian occupied part of the town, and not any military objective. The visibility on the night of attack was, according to the statements of members of his crew who were subsequently captured, perfect, so that the town was clearly distinguishable from rivers and the docks, a clearness accentuated by a snow-fall shortly preceding the attack. The airship remained over the town for about 10 minutes and dropped 7 H.E. and 13 incen-diary bombs on the town. The height of the airship over the town was estimated at 5,000 to 7,000 feet. The casualties were 18 civilians killed and 52 civilians injured. There were no military casualties.The attack on Edinburgh on 2nd April, 1916, was similar in character to that on Hull, and followed the same method, and the visibility on this occasion also was favourable. The prin-cipal attack seems to have been made on the town itself, and not limited to the docks at Leith. This airman, according to statement of the steersman of his airship, who was subsequently captured, caused the airship to be brought down to the height
of about 2,000 feet, &quot;as he found the town unprotected by guns,&quot; in order to render the bombardment effective and make certain of the results.The number pf bombs dropped on Edinburgh were 18 H.E. and 6 incendiary. The casualties appear to have been confined to civilians, and were 9 men and 2 children killed and 6 men, 13 women and 5 children injuredCase No. 3. This airman took part in the raid on Hull, already mentioned, and his method of attack on Hull was similar to that of airman No. 2 on that town.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed) HERBERT F.

In a few instances, it is true, groups of smaller1 aircraft did operate on our coasts, but these attacks were not pushed home, and need not therefore be considered. These raids, with the possible exception of the night raid of the 7th May, 1917, were carried out by either the Aeroplane or Seaplane Section of the German Naval Air Service.10. 5.15. 26. 5.15. 31. 5.15.8. 9.15. 13.10.15. 5. 3.16. 31. 3.16. 2. 4.16.I No casualties, 17. 8.15. ) but typical of 13. 9.15. j his manner of &apos; attack.13. 9.15. 5. 3.16.
With the raid of the 25th May, 1917, which occurred during daylight, a new phase of aerial attacks against this country commenced. For these attacks a new type of aeroplane specially: designed for attaining a great height and for carrying a heavy load of bombs was used. Hitherto these machines had been exclusively employed in the war zones on the Continent. Those detailed for attacks on Great Britain belonged to the 3rd Battle-Plane iSquadron, attached to the Fourth Army, and acted under the direct instructions of the German General Headquarters. This Squadron, which had been equipped with these machines in the previous February, was under the command of Hauptmann Brandenburg, who, we understand, is not a prisoner of war.The method of attack was also new. These raids were carried out by a number of machines hitherto unknown in operations over Great Britain. To the number of about eighteen they flew and attacked their objective as a single formation, working under a definite leader and in obedience to his directions. When attacked by gun-fire they merely extended their flanks and varied their altitude, maintaining as a rule their original forma-tion. Throughout these raids they consistently maintained an altitude exceeding 12,000 feet, and a continuous speed of about 65 miles an hour, thus making any accurate aim impossible.In the first three raids in 1917, viz., those of the 25th May, the 5th and 13th June, the ultimate objective was the City of London, but in the first two the objective was abandoned, and a secondary objective was attacked by the raiders on their way home.This secondary objective was, in the case of the raid of the 25th May, the embarkation port of Folkestone, the rest camps in its vicinity and the main railway line leading thereto.In view of the great importance of these objectives from a military point of view and of their proximity to the adjoining civilian area, we do not think it would be desirable or perhaps possible to formulate a specific charge against the enemy in this case. We must, however, point out that the total casualties numbered no less than 291, and damage to property to the value of about  18,000 was caused. The number of lives lost was considerable, viz., 94, of whom 17 were soldiers, 18 civilians, 33 women and 26 children.In the raid of the 5th June the secondary objective was Sheerness and the naval establishments of the Medway. The casualties only numbered 47, viz., 13 killed and 34 injured. Of the total casualties 33 were soldiers or sailors.For similar reasons in this case also we do not think it advisable to formulate a specific charge.In the raid of the 13th June the ultimate objective of the raiders, which crossed the coast 18 strong, viz., the City of London, was reached about 11.40 a.m. The attack was made from an altitude of about 13,000 feet, 121 bombs being dropped, 69 being 50 Kg. and 52 12J Kg. The first group of bombs fell between East Ham and the Royal Albert Docks; the second over the City, with Liverpool Street Station as the centre; the third at Southwark; the fourth at Dalsiton; and the fifth at Saffron Hill.   One bomb only fell on the Royal Albert Docks,
killing eight and injuring nine men. Three fell in Liverpool Street Station, killing 16 men, including four soldiers, and injuring 15 men, including four soldiers.The total casualties were 569. Of these 158 were killed, viz., 91 men, 25 women, and 42 children; and 215 men, 97 women, and 99 children were injured.At this date the 3rd Battle-Plane Squadron consisted of about 37 Gotha biplanes1 and was under the command of Captain Brandenburg. Whether the latter personally took part in all or any of the raids cannot be stated definitely, but from German illustrated papers it is clear that this squadron was known as &quot; the, English Raiding Squadron,&quot; and that it did start for the purpose of raiding England. From intercepted letters it may be presumed that Captain Brandenburg took part in some if not in all of the raids. As a reward for this raid over London he was decorated with the Ordre pour le Merite by the Kaiser. [We are not certain whether this decoration is only bestowed for distinction in actual warfare.]From the methods of attack employed, and from the wide distribution of the bombs scattered over an area, including not only the City proper but areas as far apart as Dalston on the one hand and East Ham on the other, we think that a prima facie inference may be drawn that the intention of the raiders was to bomb the whole of the City of London and its vicinity indiscriminately, including Liverpool Street Station.During the month of July three separate raids over S.E. Eng-land were carried out by the same 3rd Battle-Plane Squadron, now, owing to an accident to Captain Brandenburg, under the command of Captain Kleine. These raids took place over Harwich on the 4th, over London and Margate on the 7th, and over Harwich again on the 22nd of the month.With the raids on Harwich we do not propose to deal, but it is necessary to describe that of July 7th over London and Margate in some detail.On this occasion the enemy aircraft numbered 22 or 23, one of which broke away from the main body to attack the Isle of Thanet, probably with the intention of diverting the attention of our anti-craft defences to Kent, and thus give the raiders a better chance of raiding London with less interference. This machine dropped three 50 Kg. H.E. bombs on the town of Mar-gate, killing one man and two women, injuring two women and one chid, and causing some damage to property. No naval or military damage whatever was caused.The main body, 22 in number, between 10 and 11 a.m. approached London from the north and north-west in two flights, side by side, with a common leader, thus giving the appearance of one single Y-shaped formation. Under gun-fire the squadron spread out, and on its southward course over London was divided into three groups, consisting of two flights of nine machines each and the &quot; tail &quot; of four! As the gun-fire decreased the squadron would close up, only once more to extend.Between Cavendish Street, Shoreditch, and the Thames, off Billingsgate Fish Market, 72 H.E. bombs were dropped, fifty-six being 60 Kg. and sixteen, 12 Kg.   This was an average of less
than 3.5 per machine, the total bomb-carrying capacity of a Gotha raiding battle-plane being seven 50 Kg. and six 12 Kg. bombs. The smaller load carried on this occasion, both actually and relatively to that in the raid of the 13th June, was probably due to a desire for greater speed and superior facilities of manoeuvre if attacked by British airmen.The casualties were: Killed: Men, 85; women, 4; and children, 5. Injured: Men, 75; women, 30; and children, 30  total killed, 94: injured, 135.   Of these only four were soldiers.With the exception of the General Post Office, no public build-ings nor any possible military objectives were struck, but the damage to civilian property was very considerable. Bombs were dropped near to St. Pancras Railway Station, Mildmay Park Railway Station, in N. London; Cannon Street Station and Bishopsgate Goods Station.We are of opinion that, in view of the character of the raid, the height and speed of the raiding planes, it was impossible, even if there were any such intention, to secure with accuracy any legitimate objective, and in our opinion this raid should be classed with the raid of June .13th before: mentioned.These planes appear to have been furnished with a bomb-sight, which necessitates the close co-operation of the observer and pilot in order to be able to sight a target successfully. In other words, to render the use of this mechanism in any degree reliable, it is essential that the plane should be flying on an even keel and at a uniform speed.Prom the.methods of attack as described, it is obvious that these bomb-sights, if applied to these machines, would be absolutely valueless to ensure anything like accuracy of aim.Captain Kleine is now dead, and we are at present unaware of any evidence connecting any other person directly with this raid. As will be shown subsequently, some N.C.O.s belonging to the 3rd Battle-Plane Squadron are prisoners, but whether they took part in this raid is not known. We attribute, however, the general responsibility for these raids to the German General Headquarters.An even more typical case of indiscriminate and promiscuous bombing is that of 19th-20th May, 1918.This raid was carried Out by the largest number of machines that ever raided England, and, according to German semi-official account, London was visited at night by more machines than had hitherto together reached the capital. It was carried out on a night when the moon was two days after the first quarter, with fair visibility and patches of groundl-mist inland; 33 or 34 machines crossed the coast, and .13 reached London. The raid lasted from about 11.0 p.m. till half-past 12; the enemy machines consisted of the ordinary &quot;Gothas&quot; and also certain &quot; Giant&quot; machines. These latter machines appear to have been expressly constructed for raids over London, and we believe were first used in 1918 for this purpose. In this raid one of the &quot;Giants &quot; dropped 1,650 lb. of bombs and another 1,320. The height at which they flew varied from 8,000 to 12,000 feet, and a (?) barograph recovered from one machine which came down at Sheerness records 3,100 metres.    The speed varied from 60 to 80 miles per hour.    In
View of the large number of enemy planes which were operating on that night, and the diversity of the courses which they look&apos; in attempting to reach or in actually reaching London, it is thought that it would be more satisfactory, instead of giving details in this Report, to exhibit at the meeting of the Main Committee a map, which has been prepared by G.H.Q., which illustrates most clearly the character of the raid. All the machines, except the &quot; Giants,&quot; belonged to the 3rd Battle-Plane Squadron. The Giant machines formed part, of the 501st Giant Aeroplane Section. Of the total number engaged four machines were brought down on land and three at sea. Of machines brought down on land, from one a N.C.O. of the crew survived, and is a prisoner; from another machine two N.C.O.s were taken prisoners. The officers in each of these two machines were killed. In addition to these three prisoners, others who took part in the raid of the 19th May were, two days later, captured in France, and are, we believe, still prisoners. We are not in possession of evidence to indicate whether Captain Brandenburg was in command of this raid on that night, but the various flights to which the raiders belonged, as we have previously stated, formed part of the 3rd Battle-Plane Squadron referred to in this Report. During the raid five 300 K.G., thirty-five 100 K.G., and about one hundred and fifteen 50 K.G. bombs were dropped; 48 persons were killed, i.e., 22 men, 20 women and 6 children; and .169 were injured, i.e,, 80 men, 66 women and 23 children. Dealing only with those parts of London which suffered, it appeared that bombs were dropped in King Street, St. James&apos;s, Sydenham, Catford, Hither Green, Poplar, Bethnal Green, Manor Park, Ilford, Kilburn, Maida Yale, Islington, Kentish Town, Park Square West, Portland Place., Barking, West Ham, Plaistow, Canning Town, Red Cross Street, E.C., Hackney and Kings-land. With the exception of damage to a railway siding at Kilburn and a railway bridge at Kentish Town, the bombs struck only ordinary civilian property.We may here observe that it is possible to select an objective and bomb with accuracy, and this is shown by the raid of the 17th of February, 1918, when no less than six bombs were dropped on St. Pan eras Station buildings by one &quot; Giant&quot; machine. This performance is described as being, &quot; up to the present, by far the most accurate and concentrated fire ever yet brought to bear in any attack on. London by day or by night, and was a fine piece of shooting by the man responsible for it.&quot;Upon ordinary principles of criminal law, on the assumption that the whole of the machines taking part in the raid of l&apos;9th-20tlh May, 19.1.8, started out with the joint object of reaching and bombing London, it would appear that the res-ponsibility was joint, and that each of the prisoners who. took part in that raid is responsible for the damage caused during any part of it. We, therefore, recommend that in this case there is sufficient prima facie evidence to justify proceedings being taken against the aforesaid prisoners for having taken part in the raid of 19th-20th May, 1918. Whether Captain Brandenburg or others at present in Germany can be
made responsible, we have not before us sufficient evidence to determine.We annex to this Report a memorandum of our Chairman, in which he expresses his view as to the law which governs air attacks, marked &quot;1&quot;; a memorandum marked &quot;2&quot; by Sir Archibald Bodkin; a memorandum&apos; marked &quot; 3 &quot; by General Headquarters, Home Forces; a memorandum marked &quot; 4 &quot; by General Staff, War Office; and a memorandum marked &quot;5 &quot; by the Staff of the Air Ministry, which we submit to the Main Committee as throwing some light upon the questions of law which may arise in cases of aeroplane attacks.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed)     HERBERT F. MANISTY.Hugh H. L. Bellot,Secretary. f3rd April, 1919.MEMORANDUM No. 1. -What may be the Law applicable to Air Warfare. By Herbert F. Manisty, K.C.Under the customary laws and usages of war and humanity, the civil population and civil property (on land) of a belli-gerent are exempt from attack by another belligerent. Inci-dentally, civilians and their property may be injured in the course of a lawful attack by the enemy on a military objective; but the injury will only be excused if it is shown that the injury could not reasonably be avoided when making the lawful attack. It follows that indiscriminate bombing from the air of an open town, the large majority of the inhabitants being civilians engaged in ordinary civilian occupations, is unlawful. Further, it would seem to be correct to say that the atttack from the air by bombs on such a town as aforesaid is also unlawful, even although there may be certain legitimate military objectives situate in or near the town or place, if the attack, by reason of the conditions under which it is made, cannot be controlled1 and limited so as to be confined within a reasonable distance of the military objective. Ex. gratia the objective is a munition works situate in London. The attack is made at such a height and under such conditions that it is impossible to ensure any-thing like accuracy of aim in discharging the bomb and the latter may, and probably will, fall far away from the objective and on to purely civilian occupied spaces.I venture to submit that this is to be treated as amounting to an indiscriminate bombing of an open civilian town or place.In coming to a decision as to what attacks made on London and other towns and places are in breach of the laws and usagei
MEMORANDUM  NO. 2. The Law of Aerial Warfare. By Sir Archibald BodkinyIn the light of the cases reported by the Sub-Committee, it appears to be necessary that the Main Committee should deter-mine certain important questions which arise in connection generally with Air raids over London. Is London a. legitimate objective for general and promiscuous bombardment from the air? On the one hand, it must be recollected that there were doubtless many troops in and passing through London by its various Railway Systems continuously, as well as Military barracks, depots, warehouses for stores of military equipment, and public buildings such as the War Office, Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions, &amp;c. There were also the Docks and Shipping, and communication by bridges over the Thames from North to South. In addition to Woolwich Arsenal and Enfield, there were numerous factories engaged in the production of munitions of war in various stages; and explosives or material for making explosives were doubtless stored in large quantities. The explosion at Plaistow on Nov., 1917, would illustrate this. On the other hand, it cannot be disputed that the main characteristics of London were those of a commercial and civilian and residential city. The enormous area over which London extends, and the varied character of the different parts of that area, in which business premises and purely residential premises are closely connected, render it a city without parallel. Unlike Paris, which possesses a ring of specially constructed fortresses completely encircling the city, London possesses no such defence, although we understand that, far distant in the North and East and to the South-West, earthworks were consructed during the war for the purposes of defence against any attacking land forces. At numerous parts of London appropriately selected guns and searchlight apparatus were established, but these were solely for the purposes of defence against what were regarded as illegitimate attacks upon London by enemy aircraft.We are of opinion that London ought not to be regarded as a fortified place or fortress, and could only be properly regarded as an &quot; open town.&quot; We believe that the law of war relating to an &quot;open town&quot; is that bombardment of any legitimateof war and humanity, we propose to apply the above principles, distinguishing absolute indiscriminate attacks on open towns and places where apparently there was no military objective aimed at, from attacks where possibly there was a military objec-tive, but the conditions under which the attack is made are such that anything like reasonable accuracy of aim and pro-bability of hitting the military objective are extremely remote: whereas, on the other hand, the probability that the attack will cause damage to civilian life and property amounts, practically, to a certainty.
258military objectives within the town is permissible if such bom-bombardment can be carried out with reasonable accuracy, so as not to inflict injury to life or limb or property of the purely civilian population. There is evidence relating to the various raids in the latter part of 1917 and those in 19)18 which tends, in our opinion, clearly to show that the general object of such raids was not so much to attack legitimate objects in the London area as to influence the morale of the inhabitants of the Metro-polis. There may have been, however, some few occasions on which the intentions of the raiders were to attack legitimate objectives, which intentions were but rarely carried out. But the general impression which is gained by reading the Reports of 1917 and 1918 prepared by the I.D. of G.H.Q., Home Forces, is that the bombardments were promiscuous and reckless, and without any definite or legitimate military objective.If it should be contended that it was legitimate by these raids to overcome the anti-aircraft guns and searchlights and that with that object in view, we would submit that such a contentions-tion was not legally maintainable in view of the fact that these guns were not of such a kind as to give a character of a fortified place to London, but were purely defensive in character In our opinion the status of an open town defended by anti-aircraft gunsi is precisely analogous to that of a merchant vessel aimed defensively to resist the unlawful attack of a submarine.It may be contended that these raids might be justified by the fact that, whereas the raiders usually crossed the coast in Kent or Essex and were there fired at by anti-aircraft guns, they were justified in continuing to bomb such guns wherever suspected to be, as such guns commenced an attack upon them at a time when it was not certain from the attackers&apos; point of view whether the enemy aircraft were contemplating a legitimate enterprise such as that of bombing Woolwich Arsenal; but we also submit that this contention could not be maintained, as it appears to us unjustifiable, merely because an anti-aircraft gun fired at the raiders, to bomb indiscriminately an area more or less in the vicinity of the guns; nor do we think,would it justify proceeding over various districts of London and bombing indiscriminately during their progress.MEMOiRANDUM No. 3. Memorandum from G.H.Q., Home Forces. Aeroplane Raids over Great Britain, 1917-1918.1. Before proceeding to examine the purpose and the results of the bombing of towns in England, it is desirable to point out that raids by aeroplane, more especially those carried out by night, inevitably cause more damage to civilians and to civilian property than to objects of naval or military importance. Thfli art of bombing by aeroplane has not progressed so far that absolute accuracy can be obtained even when every possible
calculation has been employed, when the mechanical aids, ,such as bomb-sights, etc., are manipulated as skilfully as possible, and when officers and men are animated by the desire to bomb solely legitimate targets.2L In these circumstances it is proposed to adduce only such evidence as will show that:  (a) The enemy were not merely content to risk damage to civilians and civilian property in order that they might effect some naval or military damage, but that they deliberately intended to injure civilians and thereby to attack the morale of the population of this country;(6) The enemy, by his tactics and neglect of technical means, still further increased the uncertainty of hit-ting naval or military objects.3. The available evidence consists of prisoners&apos; statements and documents. Of these, the first source is the most reliable and the mos-t plentiful; documents consist only of maps and note-books, from which little information can be obtained as to the intention of the raiders. It is impossible to make any statement on the orders issued to the squadron by German General Head-quarters as to the objectives to be bombed, because no orders on this subject have been captured and prisoners cannot be trusted&apos; to supply information of sufficient weight. For similar reasons it is impossible to state what supervision was exercised by Ger-man G.H..Q., and what efforts were made to put a stop to pro-miscuous bombing. The evidence, such as it is, may be con-sidered negative.4. During the daylight raids on England it is thought that conscientious efforts were made to bomb recognised targets. A prisoner captured on July 6th, 1917, stated:  &quot; Explicit instructions are issued to all officers before their departure as to the objectives to be bombed and the formation in which the flight will be carried out. In the event of their main object being unattainable, the native targets are named.&quot;Before this last raid this man stated that tbey had received definite orders that if they could not reach London they were to bomb Sheerness. In the event of their being unable to reach any of the given objectives, the leader of the squadron was to&apos; decide what course should be followed, and would indicate the targets to be bombed by firing a green flare above them. All railways, sheds and factories are considered good targets.6., A prisoner, U.O.B.S. , captured on August 22nd, 1917, stated:  ;&quot; Before undertaking a raid there is a conference, at which the squadron commander explains the course to be followed and the objective to be bombed. The prisoner at first stated that the actual course over the objective is not ,.,. worked out beforehand, but later stated that they always arranged to bomb up wind.&quot;
6. Both these prisoners are N.C.O&apos;s., but it seems reasonable to suppose from their statements that the officers had strict instructions as to bombing before they started, and, further, that, as the squadron flew in formation, the squadron commander was able to direct and to some extent supervise the efforts of his subordinates. It is also known that:  (i) some, at any rate, of the machines used in the daylight raids were equipped with the most perfect bomb-sight produced at that time; (ii) officers received thorough instruction in its use at oneof the training depots; (iii) an examination of the actual results of the bombing done in these daylight raids would tend to show that attempts were made to bomb definite objects of naval or military importance. Photographs were taken by the enemy during the bombing presumably with the object of verifying their own results.7. In reviewing the bombing done by night, it must be borne in mind that:  (i) the machines flew singly, each machine at its maximumaltitude;(ii) the observers, for the most part, had no knowledge ofLondon except that gained from the study of plans and photographs; (iii) owing to the shading of the lights, the difficulty of accurate location was often felt. 8. On the other hand, it can be shown that:  (i) the practice of flying1 at the maximum altitude stillfurther increased the difficulty of picking up targets:(ii) bomb-sights were frequently not carried at all;(iii) if they were, no effort was made to use them to their best advantage;(iv) lastly, it has been repeatedly admitted by prisonersthat the sole object of raids was to spread terror and lower the morale of the civilian population.9. An officer, Lieut. d.E.S. captured on December5th-6th, 1917, gave the following list of targets: The City, . Bank, G.P.O., Admiralty, War Office, London Docks and East End of London generally; also Woolwich, Tilbury, Harwich, Felixstowe and Dover. Both this officer and another Leut. d.E.Y.  captured on the same night, maintained that they were able to pick out their targets and endeavoured to bomb them. But they added that if bombs went astray it was of no conse-quence, as one of the objects in raiding England was to demoralize the civilian population, particularly in the East End of London.10. The pilot Gem. E  of one machine captured onthe same night stated the general opinion of pilots in. the squadron was that only a few observers tried to bomb accurately, and that the efforts of some of these were frustrated by their pilots, who would not fly straight-forward long enough either to set the bombsight or to make use of it on a target when set.
11. An officer Ober-Lieut. S.  captured on December 18th-19tk, 1917, admitted that it was quite impossible to distin-guish buildings at night from the height at which the raiders flew.12. An officer Lieut. D.  captured on the 22nd Decem-ber, 1917, stated that he had received orders to bomb the bridges over the Thames in London.13. A N.C.O. pilot-L. -captured on 22nd May, 1918, stated that for the raid on London on May 19th-20th, 1918, his machine did not carry a bombsight.14. These statements have been selected as having been actually made by men who took part in definite raids. Many prisoners have stated generally that:  (i) most machines did not carry bombsights; (ii) most observers dropped their bombs anywhere, etc.These statements could not be accepted as evidence.15. Further, it is known that the majority of observers suffered badly from nerves, and in many cases dropped their bombs when they were attacked or even when they thought they were in danger.16. A prisoner, captured on December 5th-6th, 1917, described a bombsight which had been introduced for night bombing. It cannot be considered as highly efficient, but was thought to be sufficiently accurate for night bombing by those who used it. This bombsight is believed to have completely superseded the more complex sight used in the earlier day raids.17. The maps carried by the raiders are on a very small scale ^Woott)&apos; They were printed before the war and show large fortified areas on the coast by means of shading in green. Such areas would be assumed by pilots to be justifiable targets. London is not shaded at all. The maps, in short, were intended for land or sea surface warfare, and are inadequate for aerial purposes.MEMORANDUM No. 4.The Legal Aspect of Bombardment from the Air.The air arm is of such recent development that conventional law on the subject of bombardment from the air is very scanty.At the St. Petersburg Conference of 1868, which forbade the employment of certain arms on the ground that they caused unnecessary suffering, it was resolved to convene further meetings from time to time with a view to reconciling the advance of science in regard to armaments with the dictates of humanity.The Hague Declaration of 1899 prohibited combatants from launching projectiles or explosives from balloons or other kinds of aerial vessels, but it was only made operative for a period of five years. At the Hague Conference of 1907, a further declaration was. drafted with the object of renewing the 1899 Declaration; but it was only signed by 27 out of the 44 Powers represented, and was ratified by none of the four Central Powers
nor indeed by any of the present belligerents, except Great Britain, the United States, Portugal, and Belgium. It contains, moreover, an express provision that it shall cease to be binding when, in a Avar between the Contracting Powers, one of the belligerents is joined by a non-Contracting Power. Accordingly it has no binding force in the present War.At the Hague Conference of 1907, a suggestion was made that the bombardment of undefended towns from the air should be specifically prohibited by Convention. The Conference, however, agreed that such&apos; a course was unnecessary as aerial bombardment was already covered by Article 25 of the 1899 Land Warfare Convention, which prohibited the bombardment of undefended towns. But, in order to avoid any possible misconception on this point, the Conference agreed to insert in the 1907 Land Warfare Convention, the words by any means whatever; and the Manual of Military Law, published in February, 1914, explains (p. 252, footnote) that the words underlined were introduced to make it clear that the bombardment of undefended localities by means of balloons or other similar contrivances was prohibited by the Convention.By the same Convention, naval and military commanders are placed under an obligation to spare, as far as possible, hospitals and other privileged classes of buildings.As regards the rights of the civil population, it is recognised under the customary law that, if they take no part in the War, they ought to be exempt from deliberate attack. On the other hand, they are inevitably subject to certain of the risks of War, and the fact that loss of civilian life is occasioned incidentally by a bombardment does not render the bombardment itself illegal. Moreover, the present War is essentially a war of nations, and, as almost the whole population is engaged in work of military value, it is no longer logically possible to draw the same distinction as in former wars between combatants and non-combatants.At the 1899 and 1907 Conferences, the delegates in prohibiting the aerial bombardment of undefended towns, anticipated little more than the possibility in the future of projectiles being dropped from dirigible balloons and the modern development of aerial warfare was but vaguely anticipated. Consequently, although it is true that the bombardment of undefended towns from the air is forbidden by the Hague Convention of 1907, it cannot be claimed by that this prohibition was imposed with a full realisation of modern conditions.It is also important to note that in any case the prohibition in the 1907 Convention only applies to towns which are not defended. What constitutes a &quot; defended &quot; town has never been determined. The point was raised at the Hague Conference of 1907, but no definition was agreed either in regard to land or naval bombardments. In the latter case, difficulty was experienced in drawing a distinction between the defence of a coast and of a town near the coast.In the Manual of Military Law, it is stated that a fortress or other fortified  place may prima facie be considered  to be
&quot;defended,&quot; and that it may be bombarded unless there are visible signs of surrender. The view is also expressed that a locality which is not fortified may yet be &quot; defended,&quot; if, for example, a military force is in occupation of, or marching through it; but, with some inconsistency, the bombardment of a town is not regarded as legitimate merely because it contains supplies of value to the enemy, or railway establishments, telegraphs, or bridges. No opinion is expressed as regards munition factories.The German General Staff, on the other hand, argue that the sole criterion as to the legality of a bombardment is whether the place possesses military value to the enemy at the time; and they regard the insertion of the words &quot; by any means whatever &quot; in Article 25 of the Land Warfare Convention of 1907 as superfluous since modern history knows of hardly any case where open towns and villages within the zone of operations are not&apos; occupied by the enemy or defended.This appears to be the correct view, for, at the 1899 Conference, the word &quot; defended &quot; was substituted for the word &quot; fortified &quot; in the text of the Brussels Declaration of 1874 on the ground that the action of armies in the field would otherwise be unduly restricted. And when, at the 1899 Conference, the German delegate urged that the prohibition against the bombardment of &quot; defended &quot; towns must certainly not be interpreted as in any way forbidding the destruction by any means of any kind of building when military operations rendered such action necessary, this qualification was accepted by the Conference.The present law was framed in contemplation of wars of move-ment waged between comparatively small armies and the existence of a cordon of troops stretching from the North Sea to Switzerland, and from Switzerland to the Adriatic, presents an entirely new feature necessitating a modification of previous theories.In ancient days a town could be sufficiently defended by fortified walls around its actual perimeter, but as the range of fire extended it was found necessary to push out the fortifications further and further beyond the town. Of this process Paris affords a good illustration. Its original walls are now within the City. The forts built in 1840 for its protection were in 1870-1 converted into magazines, while a new ring of works was con-structed on a circumference of about 80 miles, or at an average distance of about eight miles from its original walls. In the present-war even this form of defence has proved ineffective against the long range of modern guns and, though the lines defending it had been pushed forward north of Soissons, German shells are to-day falling on the streets of Paris.Under modern conditions, then, it is no longer possible, except by lines drawn or operations conducted at a great distance, to render a town immune from bombardment. It would, therefore, be difficult to rebut the argument, if it were advanced, that the entire areas protected by the. existing Allied lines or by the corresponding cordon of ships in the North Sea are defended, in the sense contemplated by the Conference. Once this is admitted,
it follows that the bombardment of these areas by any means whatever, whether by land, sea, or air, is legitimate, since no legal duty has ever been imposed on attaching forces to restrict bombardment to actual fortifications, and the destruction of its public and private, buildings has always been regarded as a legitimate means of inducing a town to surrender.But, even though this view is accepted, the recognised usages of war must still be observed as regards the methods employed in carrying out the bombardment.To sum up, it may be stated that it is contrary to the spirit of international law deliberately to attack from the air churches, hospitals, and other privileged buildings where this can be avoided, or to destroy or kill, except in the pursuit of a definite military object.The fundamental criterion of the legitimacy of belligerent operations is: Do they manifestly subserve military interests, and are they justifiable on the grounds of military necessity?General Staff,War Office,12th April, 1918.MEMORANDUM No. 5. The Air Staff view of Aeroplane Raids over London.The various Conferences and Declarations dealing with laws and customs of war envisaged certain conditions, which though characteristic in the past were entirely absent during the recent war; consequently many of the provisions previously accepted, became incapable of application. Thus, former conditions per-mitted a clearer definition than is now possible between those whose activities had a direct bearing on hostilities, and those who could be regarded as taking no part in the war. It was possible to classify the people into those following their normal peaceful pursuits on the one hand, such pursuits having either a very remote or no bearing at all on warlike operations, and those, on the other hand, who materially contributed to the defeat of the enemy.That these conditions would be absent from the recent war was recognised at its outset and as a result, certain departures from established custom, such as the internment of enemy nationals, and the seizure of enemy civilians on the high seas on board neutral ships, were resorted to by the chief belligerent powers. The principle was thus accepted that the war was to be essen-tially a war of nations and that many more forms of activity and a far larger class of individuals than had been the case in former wars, would constitute potential factors in the successful conduct of operations.In this connection, it may be relevant to refer to the reply made by H.M. Government on the 23rd July, 1915, and the complaint by the U.S. Government of British Contraventions
of the laws of war, viz. (Paragraph 6): &quot;The only question which can arise with regard to the measures resorted to . . . . is whether they conform to the spirit and principles of the essence of the rules of war.&quot;- Again, Sir E. Grey, in defending H.M. Government against subsequent U.S. charges of illegality on another subject, took the line in his despatch of 16th March, 1916, to Mr Page, that &quot; War has in effect been extended far beyond the bounds of the areas in which opposing armies manoeuvre. Practical con-siderations from the belligerents&apos; point of view have changed, and the change necessarily implies a modification in the precise description of enemy subjects whom it is lawful to arrest.&quot;In brief, the nature of the war has outgrown the rules kid down in former days, defining the conditions under which war is to be carried on.Thus the scope of measures adopted to attain the desired end was widened, and to classes hitherto exempt were applied means of coercion which in former wars had been practically confined to armed forces. So long as these means conformed to the rules of warfare, an indictment against the enemy for extending their application cannot stand, but where the measures are not in accordance with the general principles of civilized warfare, we are justified in regarding the authors as war criminals.With reference to the aerial attacks on London, therefore, it is for consideration (a) whether these attacks were in themselves contrary to the principles of civilised warfare, and (6) whether the enemy conducted these attacks in a manner contrary to these general principles.With regard to (a) it is not clear what in modern war oon-stitutes an undefended town. Formerly by an open town was meant one without an outer ring of permanent works nor enclosed within an enciente, but with modern weapons such works confer little of no defensive power and their existence does not necessarily imply that a town is defended in a military sense. Paris is thus not necessarily more a defended town than is London. For the defence of London, certain preparations of a semi-permanent character were made, but this type of defence is under modern conditions as effective as an enciente was in the past and must necessarily be located at a considerable distance.Article 2 of the Eighth Hague Convention of 1907, expressly excludes from protection military works, military or naval establishments . . . workshops or plant, which could be utilised for the needs of the hostile fleet or army, and absolves the commander concerned from responsibility for unavoidable -damage caused by a bombardment under such circumstances. It is thought that this provision should in practice be regarded as substantially applicable to the bombardment of London from the air.The attack on an enemy&apos;s moral by legitimate means, includ-ing starvation of civilians by means of a blockade, or siege, has always been a recognised branch of warfare, and the value of aerial bombardment lies less in the material damage inflicted than in its moral effect.    It has been stated officially with
reference to our own raids on German towns, that the moral effect was twenty times greater than the material, and the Germans were doubtless quick to recognise&apos; this fact. The menace to London diverted machines that would otherwise have gone overseas, the mere report of an impending attack led to a suspension of traffic and of work on munitions, with a corre-sponding delay in the delivery of supplies to the front, and. tended towards a weakening of confidence in the Government. It is not considered, therefore, that the aerial bombardment of London was per se other than a legitimate operation of war.With regard to the question as to whether the enemy con-ducted their attacks in accordance with the rules of civilised war, certain factors have to be taken into consideration.A legitimate military objective is not protected by the presence in its vicinity of elements expressly excluded from the effects of hostile action. On the contrary the latter are tainted by their proximity to military objectives and lose a measure of - their immunity. The extension of legitimate objectives consequently entails a corresponding reduction in the limits of the security conferred upon elements which are exempt. London, as a harbour, the headquarters of the administration, a military centre containing a large arsenal and an industrial area, included a wide range of legitimate objects of attack, and if the difficulty of recognising individual targets and ensuring accurate practice from the air be taken into consideration, it is impossible to prove hat damage to innocent localities and individuals was avoidable.In this connection it has to be remembered that an attack upon a definite military objective such as Woolwich Arsenal, Wellington Barracks, or the War Office the Turkish War Office has been so treated may be, and usually is, met by guns and searchlights placed in parts of London where no neighbouring military objective necessarily exists. It is impossible to argue that aircraft must refrain from attempting to destroy the gun or searchlight on the ground that the latter are surrounded by ordinary residential dwellings. Such an argument would invert the basic rule of warfare, as pointed out above, and would end by reducing the contests of opposing forces to an absurdity. Hence many points in London, not lawful objectives per se, become so by the siting there of guns and searchlights which would be used against hostile aircraft whether the latter were attacking a legitimate or an illegitimate objective.In order to realise some idea of the difficulties that surround the accurate dropping of bombs from the air it must be remem-bered that good practice is dependent upon the following factors: (1) A knowledge of the ground speed of the machine. (2) The bomb sight must be set according to the height of the machine at the time the bomb is dropped. . (3) A correct estimate of the strength and direction of the wind.(4) The machine must be on an even keel when the bomb is released.(5) A close mutual understanding between the pilot and observer.
With, regard to (1), the way this estimate is arrived at is to note the time the machine flying against the wind takes to pass between two points a known distance apart, and an adjustment of the bomb sight is made accordingly. This adjustment is only correct if, when bombing the target, the conditions are the same as at the time of making the adjustment, if the machine is at the.same height, the wind is of the same force and the machine is flying into the wind.The difficulty of complying with (2) can be imagined when height is constantly being changed with the object of avoiding anti-aircraft fire.With regard to (3), this can only be estimated, as it is imr possible to gauge wind force when flying, the relative speed of an aeroplane to the air being always the same with a given engine power when on an even keel. With regard to (4), for an even keel the machine must not be in the act of turning, rising, or descending. To the above factors must be added the personal equation, perhaps the greatest source of error, and if it is remembered that during an attack airmen have to identify the target, keep formation, and be ready for the enemy&apos;s counter-measures, it will be realised that absolute accuracy of aim is a most difficult achievement.The accompanying photographs of daylight raids carried out by British machines will illustrate this. Taking the exhibits as illustrations, it will be seen that, although there is every wish to hit only points of military value, some of the bombs may fall some distance away.It should be remembered also that to bring German airmen within the scope of war criminality for bombing London would if so facto place in the same category many of our own pilots and observers.Taking these facts into consideration, the Royal Air Force Representatives on the sub-committee wish to dissent from&apos; the view that raids over London of the 13th June, 1917, of the 7th July, 1917, and of the 19th-20th May, 1918, constitute sufficient grounds for the institution of proceeding against any survivors who may have taken part.PART  III.Enemy Am Attacks on Etaples.May 19th-20th and May 31st-June 1, 1918.Your Sub-Committee present the following Interim Report Etaples consists&apos; of the town of Etaples, a hospital area of considerable extent containing several general military hospitals, and in near proximity to this hospital area a reinforcement camp, a rest camp, an important railway junction and a railway bridge. Except the hospital area, each of the above would be a legitimate military objective for au attack by enemy aircraft. On the night of May 19 at about 10.30 an attack was made by several enemy aircraft on Etaples.   The night apparently was
a clear one. The number of aircraft was twelve and the number of bombs dropped about .133. The damage done in the hospital area was considerable. The casualties in this area were, killed 102, wounded 286. &apos; In the other areas, killed 80, wounded 357. These last mentioned casualties were principally in the rest camp and reinforcement camp. Immediately after this attack special measures appear to have been taken to make the hospitals more conspicuous, in the event of a subsequent attack being made by enemy aircraft on Etaples. The Crosses were con-siderably enlarged and repainted. Photographs were then taken from the air of these Crosses, from which it would seem that at a height of 5,000 feet these Crosses would be visible to an attacking force, by the light of a magnesium flare. On the night of May 30th, one enemy machine visited Etaples and dropped a Yerey light over the hospital area, but no bombs.On the night of May 31st about 10.54 Etaples was again bombed by about 12 enemy machines. The attack continued for about an hour and 140 bombs were dropped. The casualties in the hospital area were, killed 27 including one Sister; wounded 79 including four Sisters. In other areas (military) killed 8, wounded 36. The statements of four eye witnesses of the attack were taken on June 3rd, and are to the following effect: That the raid began about 10.45 p.m. Magnesium lights were dropped over the. hospital and afterwards bombs were dropped on that area setting fire to one hut. As regards the first raid, from the reports which we have seen there does not appear to be any satisfactory vrvma facie evidence to show that the hospital area was deliberately and intentionally bombed as a distinct and separate objective. As regards the second raid there is a differ-ence of opinion between certain distinguished officers of the High Command in France. In the opinion of Major General Salmond Commanding Eoyal Air Force in France, the evidence does not disclose any deliberate intention of destruction of the hospital as such, and the damage to the hospital area might be only incidental and accidental to a legitimate enemy attack on military objectives. This opinion seems to be largely founded on what may be called the expert knowledge of a distinguished officer and not of an eye witness of the attack. It is to the following effect (a) that it is extremely improbable that the new Crosses would be distinctly visible by the light of a mag-nesium flare at a height of 5,000 feet, this being the usual height at which hostile pilots drop their bombs; (b) that owing to the conditions under which bombs are dropped from aeroplanes, it is impossible to ensure accuracy of aim within a wide margin, except from very low altitudes; and therefore in attempting to bomb military objectives, non-military objects, in near proximity, may easily and probably will be struck.On the other hand there is the opinion of Lieutenant-General Laurence, Chief of the General Staff, that the attack on the second occasion had no other object than the deliberate destruc-* See General Assert Report, paragraph 9.
tion of one or more of the hospitals. In this opinion F.M. Sir Douglas Haig concurs. These opinions appear to be principally founded on the statements of the eye witnesses. Subsequently the following questions were submitted through Colonel Davidson to the Air Ministry for their official opinion, viz:1. Was any enquiry made 1. As far as is known, no of the British airmen who &apos; enquiry was made of the took the photographs of the British airmen who took the new crosses, whether they photographs of the new were visible to them from the crosses, but in view of the air? clearness of the photographs,it is probable that the crosses would have been visible to the naked eye.   The photo-graphs in question were, of course, taken by daylight. 2. Would the crosses be        2. Yes, in the light of a visible from the air on a clear     flare equal to those in ordin-night, by the light of star     ary use by R.A.F. and pro-shells dropped directly over     viding the flare was imme-the  hospital  area  from  a     diately above the cross, height of, say, 5,000 feet?3. Do the Air Ministry 3. The Air Ministry does consider that the punishment not consider that the punish-of enemy airmen convicted of ment of enemy airmen con-having deliberately attacked victed of having deliberately British hospitals would be attacked British hospitals impolitic as being prejudicial would be impolitic provided to the conduct of legitimate always that the attack were air operations? proved beyond doubt to havebeen deliberate.The whole of the foregoing evidence and opinions and official answers to questions submitted were fully discussed at a meeting of your Sub-Committee on Thursday, 30th January, 1919. After hearing the expert views of Colonel Davidson and inspecting the photographs of the hospital area taken between the first and second raids, your Sub-Committee were unable to come to a deci-sion whether there was on the evidence such a prima facie case as to justify a charge being preferred, and if so, whether in the event of a trial a conviction might reasonably be expected to follow.Colonel Davidson was of opinion that there was no prima facie case of intentional bombing of hospital area nor of indiscriminate bombing.Sir Archibald Bodkin was of opinion that the evidence before him did not disclose a prima facie case of deliberate or inten-tional bombing of the hospital buildings, but that if there were a case of indiscriminate as distinguished from intentional bomb-ing it would be advisable to have it investigated, but this was a question of policy for the Main Committee.Sir John Macdonnell and Mr. Manisty, on the other hand, took the view that on the evidence of the eye witnesses and having regard to the opinions expressed by General Laurence and
F.M. Sir Douglas Haig, there was a prima facie case of reckless bombing of the hospital area knowing it to be such, and that an investigation by a properly constituted tribunal was advisable, even if the prosecution should fail to obtain a con-viction. A statement by Colonel Davidson containing his views and the reasons for his opinion are annexed to this Report.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed)      HERBERT F. MANISTY. .Hugh H. L. Bellot, Secretary,30th January, 1919.Memorandum on Enemy Air Attack on Etaples.By Colonel E. H. Davidson, O.B.E., M.C.In order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether there was, in this attack, deliberate intention on the part of the enemy to bomb hospital establishments at Etaples, it is necessary to examine: (i) The evidence of eye-witnesses; (ii) the conclusion arrived at by the responsible authorities in France; (iii) the decision of the War Cabinet; (iv) general service considerations.(i) Evidence of eye-witnesses. The evidence of eye-witnesses (attached) establishes the fact that aeroplanes were in the vicinity of hospitals; that bombs were dropped in the hospital area; that a magnesium flare was used, and that the hospitals were well marked with Red Crosses. More than this is not forth-coming, and, indeed, it would be manifestly impossible for an eye-witness to assert with any good reason, that an attack was deliberate, except possibly in cases where aircraft descended to very low heights. The value, therefore, of the evidence of eye-witnesses in arriving at a conclusion as to whether or not the attack on the hospital area at Etaples was deliberate is not clear. Unfortunately, no enemy aviators were brought down alive on this occasion.(ii) Conclusion arrived at by the responsible authorities in France. In the first place, the expert opinion of the General Officer Commanding the Royal Air Force in the Field was asked for, and elicited the statement that he did not consider that the raid was deliberately intended for the hospital area. He had, in fact, given this opinion in regard to the raid of the 19th-20th May, and saw no reason to alter his views with regard to the raid in question. A report, however, from Lieut.-General Sir H. Lawrence, Chief of the General Staff, stated that, in. his opinion, the attack was deliberate and the Commander-in-Chief concurred in this opinion. The expert opinion of Major-General Salmond was, therefore, overridden. It would be desirable now to endeavour to discover on what foundation this opinion was formed; and it will be found that General Lawrence enclosed a full report of the attack prepared by General Asser, upon which\
his opinion was presumably based. The report contained the following: &quot; The deliberation of this attack on the hospital.area and the method in which it was carried out show so conclusively that it was intended to destroy the hospitals, that it does not seem necessary to go into particulars of the courses of the machines. The attached statement &apos; C &apos; shows that damage was done; and from this it will be seen that the reinforcement depots got their share of the attack.&quot; Apart altogether from the former part of this extract, which appears somewhat contradictory, the latter part clearly indicates that since &quot; the reinforcement camps got their share of the attack,&quot; it could be said per contra that the reinforcement camps were attacked and that the hos-pital area got its share of the attack; in any case, it seems to indicate that these two particular areas were in such close proximity to each other that it was impossible to bomb one without hitting the other also.(iii) The War Cabinet considered the facts of the air raid on Staples and came to the conclusion, not that it was a deliberate attack on the hospital area, but that the evidence was not sufficiently definite to make it an indisputable case; and, therefore, that it would not be desirable to make special representations to the German Government in this case. From this it is evident that the War Cabinet considered the evidence inconclusive.(iv) General Service consideration. It appears clear that upon the three points already put forward, it would not be possible to arrive at a definite conclusion of culpa-bility on the part of the enemy, and it is necessary now to consider the following details:  (a) Location of the hospital area in relation to the legitimate military objectives; (b) the importance of the military objectives, and the choice of the objective; (c) the attack of 31st May/1st June, 1918, in relation to the attack of 19 /20 May, 1918; (d) accurate and indiscriminate.&apos; bombing; (e) visibility at night. Location of the hospital area, etc. To obtain a correct perspective, it is necessary to study the photographs and plans attached. Having done so, one is inclined to call the whole district involved a military area with a hospital area, would involve a passage over a military area. It is also impossible to lay down what distance separates the military from the hospital &quot;area, as the two are adjoining. The hospital area consists of huts and tents, the military area similarly consists ocf huts and tents; and without a plan of the district, it would have been impossible to mark out on the photo-graphs the limits of the hospital area. If this is so, it will be understood that it would be still more impossible to discriminate between the two areas by inspection from an aeroplane at a height of, say, 5,000 feet, travelling some 70-80 miles per hour and by night. Importance of military objectives, etc. The military objectives in the Etaples area consisted of: (i) The rein-forcement and training camps and infantry base depots; (ii) the railway bridge over the River Canche; (iii) the main line rail-way. The first of these, especially in view of the military activities of the enemy at the time, may be considered of first-rate importance.   Bombs dropped on these camps would not only
have placed hors de combat a certain number of potential infantry reserves, but would have had a considerable moral effect on troops which were shortly to play their part in the battle. By the destruction of&apos; the second of these objectives, the one and only main lateral line of communications would have been severed; and it is not necessary to emphasise the importance of such an eventuality to the enemy. Damage to the main railway would have caused congestion and delay in the movement of troops and munitions, and would, thereby, constitute this a sufficiently important military objective. It will be seen, there-fore, that this district of Etaples was, as a whole, one of the most important military objectives on the British Section of the Western Front. Assuming the enemy to consider the bombing of hospitals as legitimate, in formulating any plan for an aerial offensive against the district of Etaples, it would be necessary for him to sum up the importance of the different objectives con-cerned; and it is impossible that he could have considered the hospital area as the objective of most importance. The advan-tages obtained from the successful bombing of a hospital are nil  the personnel put hors de combat, since they were already in hospital, were already hors de combat; the moral effect, as far as military operations is concerned, is nil, and, if anything, would have a stimulating effect on other troops who hear of the outrage; the material effect has little or no bearing on the military situa-tion; it is, therefore, inconceivable that where other objectives of the highest military importance exist, a deliberate attack should have been made on the hospital area. Attack of 19 /20th May, 1918, in relation to that of 31st May/1st June. The former attack has been ruled out, as having been a deliberate attack on the hospital area; and as this is not the case with the second attack, it would be convenient to compare the two. In the first case, the casualties were, unfortunately, very heavy, and the material damage to the hospitals considerable. The raiders, therefore, probably returned well satisfied with their night&apos;s work, and reported in a somewhat exaggerated manner the damage wrought. The next incident occurred on the night 30/31st May, when an enemy aeroplane flew over the Etaples area and discharged a magnesium flare, but no bombs. The object of sending such a machine on a comparatively long and risky undertaking was, presumably, for the purpose of recon-naisance and to report on the damage recently inflicted. This machine, therefore, would have returned, and, assuming that the reconnaisance had been successful, it would have reported that a portion of the encampments was badly damaged, but that the greater portion was still intact On such a report being received, orders would, presumably, be given for an attack on the undam-aged area, which, in this case, would be the reinforcement and other camps, as it is inconceivable that a second attack would be ordered on an area which had already been partially destroyed. This theory would seem to indicate the orders for the attack which took place the following night. In this attack, the following facts would seem to substantiate the above theory: (i) The casualties in the hospital area were considerably smaller than on the former occasion; (ii) the reinforcement camps got
their share of the attack, according to the report of the G.O.C., Lines of Communication Area. Accurate and indiscriminate bombing. In the present state of development of aviation . generally and of bomb sighting apparatus in particular, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between inaccuracy in bomb dropping and indiscriminate bombing. It must be remembered that in bomb-dropping the following points have to be taken into consideration, that is to say, the height of the machine, the speed at the time of releasing the bomb, say 70 to 80 miles per hour, the direction of the wind, the velocity of the wind, unknown wind velocity and direction at heights between the machine and the ground, and many other circumstances. It is also desirable to remember that a machine is travelling between 30 and 40 yards per second, and that an error of one second in releasing a bomb makes a difference of so many yards on the ground. It is not necessary to labour this point any further, as it appears sufficient to show that a novice might very easily make such bad aiming that the result of his bombing would, to all intents and purposes, appear indiscriminate. Until further develop-in ents in aviation have supplied an accurate means of dropping bombs, it will be impossible to differentiate between discriminate and indiscriminate bombing, more particularly in view of the fact that in the case of a faulty bomb-carrier the bomb may not fall immediately the release gear is actuated. Further, there is no doubt that the more aircraft are harassed by anti-aircraft defences, the more erratic will be the bombing, and, therefore, the greater the appearance&apos; of indiscriminate attack. If the point of indiscriminate bombing is insisted upon, then it means that until accuracy can be assured aircraft cannot be used as an arm in modern warfare with which to bomb military objectives.Visibility by night. The General Officer Commanding the Royal Air Force dn France stated that he considered it extremely unlikely that red crosses would be visible from a height of, say, 5,000 feet by the light of a magnesium flare; whereas the answer given by the Air Ministry to a question on this point was that a red cross would be seen by the light of a flare equal to those in use by the Royal Air Force, providing the flare was immediately above the red cross in question. The opinion expressed from France was probably based on a wider experience than that ex-pressed by the Air Ministry; but, nevertheless, there appears to be uncertainty on this point; but it was apparently not considered of sufficient importance to warrant tests being carried out, which procedure was suggested by Major-General Salmond. The com-parative efficiency of flares used by the enemy with those used by the Royal Air Force is also a question which would have a considerable bearing on this point. Yisibility varies very much by night according as the ground mist rises or lies in patches; and visibility is further affected, in regard to the direction of flight of the machine as compared with the position of the moon; that is to say, that a machine flying in one direction might find the visibility good, whereas another machine flying in the opposite direction might find great difficulty in picking up points. Another point is that a machine well above a ground haze may
see through it, whereas actually iu such a haze it will see little. (5) In considering all the above points, the evidence does not appear to disclose a deliberate attack upon the hospital area, but, such as it is, gives rather an impression to the contrary; and, further, the evidence of eye-witnesses in a bomb attack cannot, except in the presentation of actual facts, be anything but biased. The general service and common sense considerations seem to clearly indicate the uselessness, and therefore improbability, of a deliberate attack on the hospitals, whilst the effect in bringing a charge against the enemy in regard to the case under considera-ion would be to allow military objectives to be safeguarded from attacks from the air by means of placing a hospital establishment in the vicinity.Report by Lieut.-General Asser. 19th June, 1918. Extract from File No, 121 /Francej2266.H.Q., L. of C. Area, No. G/1240.General Headquarters.In reply to your A.A.11, dated 9th instant.The bombing attack on Etaples on the night, 19th-20th May, commenced at 10.36 p.m. The alarm was given at 10.30, and the electric lights appear to have been extinguished by 10.36, when the first A.A. Section opened fire. The night was clear, and the moon was at two days after first quarter.2. It is estimated that there were 11 enemy machines. Of these 7 came from the East, 2 from the North by land, and the remainder from the North by sea. I enclose a map showing the course taken by each machine as far as can be estimated, and the spots where the bombs were dropped. As the machines circled in order to bomb a burning hospital, the bombs dropped by a partictilar machine can only be estimated by the probable turning angle.The number of bombs, dropped was 133.3. There were direct hits on buildings, marquees and tents in three hospitals and two base depots, and possibly more in the burnt-out areas.I attach a statement marked &quot;A,&quot; showing in detail where the bombs fell and the casualties caused at each spot.4. A certain number of casualties not accounted for in the statement were caused by fragments from these bombs in other camps, especially among men moving about to put out fires, etc.The total casualties were:  (i) In Hospital areas ...(ii) In other areasKilled.   Wounded.   Missing. 102        286 -80        357 10182        643 10Civilian casualties, 5 wounded.
5. As regards damage done, I attach a statement marked &quot;B,&quot; showing the particulars of damage to military property.The destruction of property belonging to French inhabitants is valued at under  4,000. It consisted of damage to houses caused by 4 bombs.6. In reply to three points (a), (b) and (c) of para. 2 of the C.I.G.S.&apos;s letter:. (a) Witnesses state that the airmen used their machine-guns, but there were no casualties reported from machine-gun fire. In many of the recent raids on L. of C. installations&apos; a small amount of machine-gun fire has been heard, but so little that it is believed to be used more as a signal than for offensive purposes. In this case a German officer captured from a machine that was brought down said he fired a few rounds at a searchlight.(b) Nothing is known about warning notices having been dropped. There were rumours that this had been done, but these were not substantiated.(o) It is not correct that a munition dump is situated in the immediate vicinity of the Etaples hospitals. It is about 7,000 yards away. (The dump is painted yellow on the enclosed map.) From the course of the machines it is clear that the dump was not the objective.7. As to whether the bombing of the hospital camps was intentional or not, the prisoners taken from the captured machine stated that their objective was the camp and not the bridge; they did not know it was a hospital area, and the number of bell tents convinced them that it was not one, as patients would not be in bell tents. A glance at the enclosed photographs (key attached) disposes of the excuse, as the area of reinforcement depots was practically untouched, although all the troops are in bell tents.   The two camps are separated by a belt of trees.One of the hospitals had a large cross of red lamps. This hospital was untouched on the night in question, but from what occurred subsequently on the night of the 31st May/1st June, it would seem that the fact that there was a lighted cross there had nothing to do with its escape.8. After the raid of 19th/20th May it was arranged that the hospitals should be so clearly marked that there could not possibly be any doubt about it. On the 28th May the enclosed photograph of the hospital area was taken. It is clear that it is impossible to take the area for anything but a hospital area.9. On the night of 30th/31st May one enemy machine visited Etaples and dropped a &quot;Verey&quot; light over the hospital area but no bombs.On the night 31st May/1st June Etaples was again bombed. The attack commenced at 10.54 and continued for about an hour. It is estimated that there were 12 enemy machines and that they dropped 140 to 150 bombs,
10. The deliberation of this attack on the hospital area and the method in which it was carried ont show so conclusively that it was intended to destroy the hospitals, that it does not seem necessary to go into particulars of the courses of the machines. The attached statement (0) shows what damage was done, and from this it will be seen that the reinforcement depots got their share of the attack.11. The total casualties were:  Killed.   Wounded.   Missing.(i) In hospital area......&apos;   21* 79 f 1(ii) In other areas    ......      8 361         (iii) Civilians......     ...&quot;       -Total     ...    35        115 1The numbers are small as compared to the former raid, thanks to the more complete state of the protective measures and the absence of troops in the neighbourhood.12. The method of attack was as follows:  A machine dropped a parachute light over the hospitals. This light broke into three lights as it fell. It is said, to have fallen over or in the immediate neighbourhood of the St. John of Jeru-salem Hospital. This was followed by a shower of bombs which practically destroyed this hospital. At an early stage a direct hit on the offices of No. 51 General Hospital started a large fire. Within 20 yards of this fire there is a large cross. The glare of the fire facilitated the bombing operations on this and the neighbouring hospitals, and the machines circled round and dropped bombs for about an hour.13. From particulars obtained from the machine captured on the 19th/20th May raid the number.of bombs carried on these bombing machines is 16. The weights of the bombs are as follows:  Four weighing 100 kilos. Four    ,,       50   ,, Eight   ,,       121 Total weight   700   ,,(Sd.)  J. ASSEE,Lieut.-General, G.O.C., L. of C.

Statements of Eye Witnesses.Extracts from File No. 121 j21153.Lt. Colonel C. J. Trimble, E.A.M.C., states:-On the night of 31st May 1st June, about 10.20 p.m., I heard an aeroplane overhead.  Within a minute or two the Air-raid warning was given.   Aeroplanes were audible from that time onwards until the end of the raid, which occurred about 12.15.About 1.1.20 I saw a very, bright magnesium light come down, which was visible for two or three minutes and illuminated every-thing with the utmost distinctness. About four minutes later four large bombs were dropped along the North side of the hospital, wrecking two wards completely and two others almost completely, causing the deaths of 1 sister, 3 staff, and 7 patients, besides numerous wounded (44). The bombs fell in the quickest succession. Other bombs fell later on the South side of the hospital, but the damage done was not so great. The entire hospital was shaken and damaged and every department was disorganised by material damage.At the time of the raid there were nine red crosses painted on white grounds on various roofs of the hospital buildings, averaging 30 feet in diameter.(Sd.) CHARLES J. TRIMBLE.June 3, 1918.vLt. Colonel W. J. Taylor, R.A.M.C., Commandant No. 51 General Hospital, states:  On the night 31st May 1st June I was in my hospital. The raid began about IU.45. A magnesium light was dropped almost over the hospital about 11.15; it was a very bright one. Almost immediately afterwards, in fact before it was extinguished, four bombs were dropped within a space of 15 yards, setting, on fire the administrative block and completely destroying it. Another bomb was dropped while the fire was burning.On the hospital building-s there are four red crosses painted on a white ground, about 25 feet across; there is also within the hospital limits a white cross about 40 feet across, made of white cloth on a green background. The limbs are about 6 feet across. These were all there at the time of the raid.The casualties were 7 killed and one injured.(Sd.)  W. J. TAYLOR, Lt,-Colonel, R.A.M.C.,O.C, No, 51 General Hospital,June 3, 1918,
Kathleen M. Smith, Matron, 56 General Hospital, states:  On the night of May 31st June 1st I was in the hospital. The raid started shortly before 11. I saw one magnesium light dropped, which seemed to be directly overhead and lasted about two minutes. Almost immediately afterwards at least one bomb fell outside the nurses&apos; quarters.(Sd.)   KATHLEEN M. SMITH, Matron.June 3, 1918.J. Paul Bush, Colonel, C.M.G., O.C. 56 General Hospital, states:  On the night of May 31st June 1st I was in the hospital when the raid took place.There are two very large red crosses on the hospital, one 27 feet across painted on a white ground on a roof, the other about 80 feet square on the ground on a white background of chalk.Immediately adjoining the nurses&apos; quarters there is another large red cross on a roof not on my hospital premises.About 20-30 bombs were dropped in and in close proximity to the hospital.(Sd.)

MEMORANDUM ON THE DETENTION OF NAPOLEON BUONAPARTESThe policy of the Powers with regard to the treatment of Napoleon after his defeat at Waterloo displays three distinct phases.. The history of this policy opens with the proposal by Prussia that Napoleon should be summarily shot.. This proposal was finally abandoned on the 29th June in deference to the opinion of the Duke of Wellington. It was followed by a project for the capture of Napoleon and his surrender to the French Gfovernment. That project was in its turn abandoned on the .15th July. There was substituted for it the policy of the custody of his person by Great Britain on the part of the Allied Powers, which received formal sanction in the Convention of the 2nd August.I.-The Prussian Project.The history of the announcement of the policy of Prussia is given by Baron von Muffling.! &quot;During the march on Paris, Field-Marshal Bliicher had one time a prospect of getting Napoleon into his power; the delivering up of Napoleon was the invariable condition stipulated by him in every conference with the French Commissioners sent to treat for a peace or armistice. I received from him instructions^ to inform the Duke of Welling^ ton that as the Congress of Vienna had declared Napoleon out-lawed, I it was his intention to have him shot whenever he caught; him. . . . The Duke, ... in the first place, disputed&apos; the correctness of this interpretation of the Viennese declaration of outlawry, which was never meant to incite to the assassination of Napoleon.II He therefore did not think that they could acquire from this act any right to order Napoleon to be shot. .   .   .   But be this. as it may   ...   it appeared to him* The clearest and most detailed narrative of events is given by Houssaye : 1815, t. iii. 357-402, 518-522.f Von Muffling : Passages from my Life, 1853, 252-3.j Cf. App. I.: Grneisenau to Von Muffling, 27th June.5 The relative paragraph of Declaration of the Powers dated Vienna, 13th March, 1815, is as follows : (&apos; Les Puissances declarent en consequence que Napoleon Buonaparte s&apos;est place&quot; hors des relations civiles et sociales, et que, comme ennemi et perturbateur du repos du monde, il s&apos;est livrd a la vindicte publique.&quot;  Wellington: Dispatches, 1789-1815, ed. Gunvood xii. 269-270.I The declaration of 13th March was at the time vigorously attacked by the Opposition in the House of Commons [of. Diary and Correspondence of Oh. Abbot, Lord Colchester, 1861, ii. 536, 539]. This attack was greatly resented by the Duke as one of the signatories, and he wrote to Mr. W. Wellesley Pole pro-testing against the misinterpretations to which the Declaration had been subject: &quot; Bruxelles, 5th May, 1815 ... I say, first, that the Declaration-has never been accurately translated, and the meaning of the words vindicte publique is not&apos; public vengeance,&apos; but&apos; public justice.&apos; But if even the meaning was &apos; public vengeance,&apos; the declaration does not deliver Buonaparte over to the dagger of the assassin. When did the dagger of the assassin execute the vengeance of the public ? &quot; Wellington : Despatches, 1799-1815, ed. Gurwood, xii. 351-3.
that  .   .   .   they were become much too conspicuous per-sonages to justify such a transaction in the eyes of Europe.&quot;* Baron von Muffling was himself disposed to agree with the Duke&apos;s views &quot;and was therefore little disposed to dispute them,&quot; and on 29th June Blucher withdrew his proposal.   Von Gneisenau wrote: &quot;I am directed by the Field-Marshal to request your Excellency Von Muffling to communicate to the Duke of Wellington that it had been his intention to execute Buonaparte on the spot where the Due D&apos;Enghien was shot;f that out of deference, however, to the Duke&apos;s wishes, he will abstain from this measure.&quot;!  At the same time he set out the Prussian view with less reserve in a private letter to Von Muffling, g   The Duke informed the French deputation, which arrived at Noyon on the 27th June for the purpose of negotiating for an armistice and for Napoleon&apos;s passing to America, that he &quot; did not consider the abdication of Buonaparte to afford such a guarantee to the Allied Powers &quot; as to induce him to stop his operations, but that he &quot; should consider the object attained if Napoleon were given to the Allies, if our advanced guards enter Paris, and if a Govern-ment were established in France which should conciliate the confidence not only of France but of Europe, &quot;II and that he had no authority as to the proposition of passports to America.^  In reply to a request by the deputies to know with what treatment Napoleon would meet were he surrendered, he stated that he would treat him as a prisoner of war, pending the further deliberations of the Allies.**   The deputation ultimately refused the surrender on the grounds of the horror with which the act would be received in France, and that they believed Napoleon had already left Paris for Rochefort-tt  This he in fact did on the 29th June.II. The Project of Surrender to the French Government.With the escape of Napoleon to Rochefort the problem of his disposal was transferred from the commanders in the field to the diplomats,  if(a) The Policy of Great Britain.The policy of the British Government was outlined in a letter from the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, to Lord Casflereagh, then in Paris, dated &quot; Fife House, July 7th &quot; :-&quot; There are three questions which occur to every person one meets:   What is to become of Buonaparte?

What is to be done with the French armies ? If these three points cannot be solved in a satisfactory manner, the country will expect, and justly, I think, expect, further securities for the continuance of a peace on an improved frontier. ... I conclude the emperors and kings will come to Paris as soon as they hear of the capitulation.* By that time we shall be able to form some judgment of the probable fate of Buonaparte. If he sails from either Rochefort or Cher-bourg, we have a good chance of laying hold of him. If we take him, we shall keep him on board of ship till the opinion of the Allies has been taken. The most easy course would be to deliver him up to the King of France, but then we must be quite certain that he would be tried and have no chance of escape. I have had some conversation with the civilians, and they are of opinion that this would be, in all respects, the least objectionable course. We should have a right to consider him as a French prisoner, and as such to give him up to the French Government. They think like-wise that the King of France would have a clear right to consider him as a rebel, and to deal with him accordingly. .   .   .&quot;tOn the 28th July, Count Lieven, the Russian Ambassador, wrote to Nesselrode that Lord Liverpool had told him that &quot; les homines de loi de ce pays-ci etaient generalement d&apos;opinion que Sa Majeste Tres-Chretienne aurait eu tout droit et sans grand examen de le faire juger et condamner.&quot;JThe genesis of this view is apparent in the letter from the Duke of Wellington, to which reference has already been made, deal-ing with the Declaration of the 13th March. It is. necessary to bear in mind the extreme rapidity of the movement of events. In March the Powers were faced with an insurrection in France; by the end of June they had seen an Empire successfully usurped and irretrievably lost. It was not unnatural, therefore, that in July the minds of statesmen should still bear the impress of the news of- treachery and rebellion. The Duke of Wellington had written in May, referring to the action taken by the Allies in March&apos;, &quot; in regard to his being declared &apos; hors la loi&apos;; first it must be recollected at what period and under what circumstances he was so declared. The period was the 13th of March; and, although we knew that Buonaparte had landed and had made progress in France sufficient to create a contest there, we were not aware that he could be established without firing a shot. The object then of this part of the publication was to strengthen the hands of the King- of France by the opinion of the Congress.

Memoirs . . . de Metternich, ii. 525-6.     &apos;I Of. the case of Savary.Secondly, was he not &quot; hors la loi &quot; ? and had he or not brokenall the ties which connected him with the world? The only treaty by which he was connected with the world was that of Fontainebleau: that he broke. Having quitted his asylum, he landed in France with such a force as showed that he relied solely upon treachery and rebellion, not only for success, but for safety. He incurred all risks in order to gain the greatest prize in Europe, one which he had abandoned only ten months before under a treaty with the Allied Powers; and is it possible that it can be gravely asserted that Buonaparte, an individual like any other, should have been guilty by this act of only a breach of treaty? If he was guilty of more, of which there can be no doubt, it was of the crime of rebellion and treason with a view to usurp the sovereign authority of France; a crime which has always been deemed &quot;hors de la loi &quot; so far as this, that all sovereigns have at all times, called upon their subjects to raise their arms to protect them from him who was guilty of itv .   .   .&quot;*The proposal made by Lord Liverpool was, however, rejected by France. On the .12th July, Lord Castlereagh wrote from Paris: &quot; From what has occurred in conversation on this subject, it appears to me that the King of France&apos;s Government will not, and perhaps have not sufficient authority to, charge themselves with judging and executing Buonaparte as a traitor. If so, and he should fall into our hands, there is no other course than to confine him as a prisoner. The Emperor of Russia asked me this morning whether the British Government would undertake the charge. I told him that the task was not a very pleasant one, but that I had no doubt they would be disposed to meet whatever might be the general wish. I think it is: quite clear he must not be in France, and that he is better beyond sea, than in any more accessible part of Europe; but if we are to take charge of him I think it is desirable that it should be as a prisoner of the principal Powers, France included, who should each nominate a Commissary to exercise a joint surveillance over him. Fort St. George might in this case be rendered a suitable place for his residence.&quot;tHad Lord Liverpool^ proposal been accepted, that acceptance would, as will subsequently be apparent,]; have involved the Government in very serious difficulties.t(b) Measures Taken for the Capture of Napoleon.Meanwhile measures had been taken to secure the person of the subject of these negotiations.On the 8th July Lord Castlereagh wrote : &quot;I understood from the King this- evening that he had given orders to Fouche to use every exertion to arrest Buonaparte. I apprised both his Majesty and Talleyrand that I conceived the policy of Europe
towards France must be materially influenced by Buonaparte&apos;s being left at liberty to return again to the charge, when a new complot could be arranged.&quot;* Ou the 6th July Admiral ITotham bad been warned of the departure of Napoleon for Rochefort, and directed to prevent his escape to America.!On the 10th Lord Castlereagh reported: &quot; Buonaparte is still at Rochefort5 it is said, on board of a frigate. Fouche expresses no. expectation that he will secure him, but I cannot perceive that it rests upon any solid foundation.&quot;! On the 12th he wrote: &quot; Buonaparte was still on board of the Saale frigate at Rochefort on the 8th ... I have . . . conversed with M. Jaucourt, who justifies the feebleness of his order, $ as being addressed to persons who had not yet acknowledged the King&apos;s authority, and who could not be expected to execute a direct instruction of arrest. Seeing the futility of this arrangement, I have proposed to them to endeavour to concert measures with the British Squadron off Rochefort for effectuating the arrest by their introduction into the harbour. I expect M. Jaucourt and M. Fouche to call on me in the course of the day on this subject when, with the assistance of Mr. Croker, who is in town, every endeavour will be made to give effect to this plan.&quot;if The story is taken up by Croker.&apos;&apos; I visited Paris between the Battle of Waterloo and the embarkation of Buonaparte, and was at one or two meetings with Lord Castlereagh, the Duke of Wellington, Fouche, Talleyrand, and M. de Jaucourt, Minister of Marine, when we discussed the best method of laying hold of Buonaparte. I took the liberty to advise an order to our Admiral to advance suddenly under the white flag,! and in concert with the King&apos;s officers to seize the ex-Emperor. I calculated that it would take ten Tidnutes before the authorities could be in-duced to fire on the white flag, and in that time our sailors and marines would be in possession of the town. This was finally agreed to, and a letter to Sir C. Hotham,H who com-manded our squadron, was prepared to that effect, with this remarkable notification that it was very desirable to take Buonaparte alive, and with as little violence, and even in-oonvenience to him personally, as possible, but that he was to be taken; and that the life of any British sailor was as dear to the King of England as that of Buonaparte. This was the way I stated it at the meeting, and it was in sub-stance implied in the dispatch, but not so crudely; but we were anxious to frighten Fouche, whom we still suspected* Correspondence, Dispatches, &amp;c, of Viscount Castlereagh, 3rd series, ii. 419.

of some intrigue with Buonaparte, and we thought it likely that he would apprise him of our violent resolutions or something to this effect. This dispatch was entrusted, as well as the corresponding powers on the part of France, to Captain de Bigny.* There seems every reason to suppose that Fouche, by the telegraph or some other means, communicated to Napoleon these determined measures; for he, immediately after these resolutions were taken, but before the arrival of de Rigny, suddenly changed all his plans! and gave himself up to Sir C. Hotham.&quot;!III. Determination upon Indefinite Imprisonment.The receipt by Lord Liverpool of the decision of France not to accept responsibility for bringing Napoleon to justice as a rebel coincided with Napoleon&apos;s surrender to Captain Maitland. $ In order to appreciate the development of the policy of the Government during the next fortnight it is material to note the course of events in London.(a) Narrative of Events in London, 15th-28tth July, 1815.Parliament had been prorogued on the 12th.

Before I enter on other matters, I am desirous of apprising you of our sentiments respecting Buonaparte. If you should succeed in getting possession of his person, and the King of France does not feel sufficiently strong to bring him to justice as a rebel, we are ready to take upon ourselves the cutody of his person on the part of the Allied Powers; and, indeed, we should think it better that he should be assigned to us than to any other member of the Confederacy. In this case, however, we should prefer that there were not Commissioners appointed on the part of the other Powers, but that the discretion should be vested en-tirely in ourselves, and that we should be at liberty to fix* Cf.

the place of his confinement, either in Great Britain, or at Gibraltar, Malta, St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope or any other colony we might think most secure.&quot; We incline at present strongly to the opinion that the best place of custody would be at a distance from Europe, and that the Cape of Good Hope or St. Helena would be the most proper stations for this purpose. If, however, we are to have the severe responsibility of such a charge, it is but just that we should have the choice of the place of confinement, and a complete discretion as to the means necessary to render that confinement effectual.&quot; Believe me to be, &amp;c,&quot; Liverpool.&quot;*The news of Buonaparte&apos;s surrender reached London on 21st July. Lord Castlereagh added in the postscript which con-tained this news: &quot;You must make up your mind to be his gaolers. The French Government will not try him as a traitor, and there is nowhere a place so suitable for his confinement as in Fort St. George under a joint surveillance.&apos;&quot; The Emperor of Russia approves this plan, so does Austria, so does France, and so, no doubt, will Prussia. He will be less exposed in England to any sudden change in European politics, and after fighting him for twenty years, as a trophy, he seems to belong to us.   .   .   .&quot;fBy this date the Government had clearly made progress in the consideration of the question. Immediately upon the re-ceipt of the news,Lord Liverpool wrote as follows to Castlereagh : &quot; We are all decidedly of opinion that it would not answer to confine him m this country. Very nice legal questions might arise upon the subject, which would be particularly embarrass-ing. But, independent of these considerations, you know enough of the feeling of people in.this country not to doubt he would become an object of curiosity immediately, and possibly of com-passion in the course of a few months; and the circumstances of his being here, or indeed anywhere in Europe, would con-tribute to keep up a certain degree of ferment in France.&quot; Since I wrote to you last, Lord Melville and myself have con-versed with Mr. Barrow on the subject, and he decidedly reeom-mends St. Helena as the place in the world the best calculated for the confinement of such a person. At such a distance and in such a place, all intrigue would be impossible; and being withdrawn so far from the European world, he would very soon be forgotten. To conclude, we wish that the King of France would hang or shoot Buonaparte as the best termination of the business;! but if this is impracticable and the Allies are de-sirous that we should have the custody of him, it is not un-reasonable that we should be allowed to judge of the means by-* Correspondence, Dispatches, &amp;c, of Viscount Castlereagh, 3rd series, ii. 430.f F.O. 92/21.

which that custody can be made effectual.&quot;* And directions must already have been sent to Major-Genera! Sir H; Torrens, for his report to Lord Bathurst on the Island of St. Helena is dated Cheltenham, 22nd July.t On the 24th Lord Bathurst wrote to the Duke of Wellington : &quot; &quot;We have nearly determined, subject to what we may hear from Paris in answer to Lord Liverpool&apos;s letter a week ago, to send Buonaparte to St. Helena. &quot;$On the 25th Lord Buckingham wrote to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the East India Company informing the Court of the Governments selection of St. Helena as Buona-parte&apos;s residence, g The reply of the Court was received on the following day.II On the 28th the Government received a further memorandum on St. Helena from Major-General Beatson.1I On the 24th Lord Castlereagh had added as a postscript to his dis-patch of that date, &quot; I forgot to mention that I believe there will be no sort of difficulty in leaving the unrestricted custody of Buonaparte&apos;s person to the British Government, under per-haps some engagement with the other Powers not to turn him loose without their consent.&quot;**On tho 28th July Lord Liverpool reported the final decision of the Government: &quot; We have completed all the arrangements for conveying Buonaparte to the island of St. Helena. Melville writes to Lord Keith to-night to desire that he will announce to him his destination.tt We certainly concur with you in opinion that a Convention should be signed between us and the Allies by which Buonaparte is to be considered as a common prisoner, though in our custody, and that we should not give him up or release him except to joint consent. You will perhaps employ somebody to draw up the draft of such a Convention.&quot;^ In a letter dated August 3rd he added, &quot;We have had abundant proof that it would have been quite impracticable to have de-tained him here without the most serious inconvenience.&quot;The decision was communicated to Napoleon at Plymouth on the 31st July.Hit He entered a formal protest, fflj but the Govern-ment refused to modify its policy,*** and on the 7th August he was transferred to the &quot; Northumberland,&quot; and the next day set sail.On the 28th July the representatives of the Allies in Paris formally acquiesced in the policy of Great Britain.!tt* Correspondence . . . of Castlereagh, 3rd series, ii. 434-5.

The Convention between the Allied Powers was signed at Paris on the 2nd August.* On the 4th August, France was invited to co-operate.   The invitation was accepted on the 7th.tNapoleon entered a protest against the consideration of him as the common prisoner of the Allies in a letter written by Montholon to Sir Hudson Lowe on the 25th August, 18.16.J(c) The Napoleonic View.  ,It is extremely difficult to determine with any precision the views of Napoleon, and his suite upon these proceedings. There are, however, several aspects of the case upon which the evidence is quite clear.Firstly, Napoleon was undoubtedly, at the time of his sur-render, in imminent danger of capture under the Bourbon flag. In connection with the attack planned by Croker to which refer-ence has been made above, he was threatened by danger from the shore. Napoleon had,, on the 8th July, under the orders of the Provisional Government, embarked upon the Saale. Upon the 9th he visited the Isle d&apos;Aix. Upon the 12th he again landed there and remained there until the morning of the 15th. Upon the 14th July Bonnefoux, the Maritime Prefect at Roche-fort, received orders from the Conte de Jaucourt, the new Minister of Marine appointed by Louis XVIII, to keep Napoleon on the Saale and not to allow him to communicate with the British. Bonnefoux, whether acting on his own initiative or under inspiration from Paris, g was careful to avoid the fulfil -ment of his orders. At 3 p.m. on the 14th he reported to the Minister of Marine that Napoleon was.still on the Saale. At 8 p.rn. he wrote to the Commander of the Saale asking him to warn Napoleon of the order for his arrest.^ At 11 p.m. he left Rochefort for the Saale, where he arrived at 1 a.m.   Pleading* Cf. App. III. f F.O. 92/23.j Santin6: An Appeal to the British Nation, 1817. Cf. F. Masson : Napoleon et sa famille, t. xiii. 30-37.5 I. This would probably not, in fact, have been followed by treatment as a rebel. The French authorities were in a very difficult position, (a) They had prohibited Buonaparte&apos;s return to the mainland. (6) They had prohibited con-conflict with the British cruisers by the French frigates on his behalf, (c) They were willing that the Allies should arrest him. [Cf. F.O. 27/118, Sir 0. Stewart to Castlereagh, Paris, 10th July, reporting Fouch6 : &quot; The British Government may dispose of Buonaparte as they think proper, or if your arrangements do not allow you to come to a resolution without the concurrence of the Allies, he may remain on board until you have this determination.&quot;] (d) But they did not wish to incur the odium of arresting him themselves, had only acceded to Croker&apos;s plan under pressure, and informed their subordinates that the arrest would be made on behalf of the Allies. [Cf. Houssaye : 1815, iii. 397-8.] Hence: II. It is possible that the orders given in Paris on the 13th were deliberately forestalled by the surrender of the 15th. Cf. Maitland to Hotham, 10th July, Owen&apos;s Coll. Studies, J. H. Rose : The Detention of Napoleon, 498.  But :-III. It is a different, and a very difficult, question whether Buonaparte knew of the proceedings of the 13th, and, if he was informed, what he knew of the arriere pensee of his informants.I Cf. Croker&apos;s opinion cited above.% In the B. of Crawford&apos;s Collection : printed by Norwood Young : Napoleon in Exile ; St. Helena, i. 48.
fatigue lie spent the night on the ship. Between 1 and 2 a.m. his letter, dated 8 p.m., was forwarded by the captain to Becker on the Isle d&apos;Aix.* Before 3 a.m. Napoleon embarked on the brig Eperder, and at about 6 a.m. was transferred to tbe Bellerophon.iSecondly, Napoleon never assented to the proposition that he was a prisoner of war, and therefore never claimed any rights as such. It had been proposed that on the night of 13th-14th July he should have attempted to escape hidden in a barrel on board a Danish vessel. When the completion of the arrangements was announced to him at 11. o&apos;clock on the night of the 13th, he refused to go, adding, &quot; There is always danger in confiding one-self to enemies, but it is better to take the risk of confiding in their honour than to fall into their hands as a prisoner accord-ing to law.&quot;t And after his surrender he repeatedly denied that he was a prisoner of war, g although he was aware of the rights of a prisoner of war in international law.ilThirdly, although he frequently asserted that he had not reached the limit of his resources in France, H he expressly dis-avowed any claim to have surrendered on conditions.*&apos;*Fourthly, he professed to consider himself as a simple indi-vidual seeking asylum in Great Britain.ftBeyond this point it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at any definite conclusions. There is some evidence to show that Napoleon was genuinely misled by the persons who negotiated the surrender upon his part. JI It is possible that these persons were themselves misled,!I although that is a more doubtful proposition. It is more probable that they were both ignorant of the legal aspects of the situation and careless. But whatever the facts of the case may have been, they are not very material to the question here under discussion. The position of prisoner of war having been evacuated, the question of asylum becomes a matter of grace in view of the fact that Great Britain was still in a state of war with Napoleonic France.HH Did Napoleon, therefore, surrender under a misapprehension, his expectations* Ibid., 48-9. &apos;f Norwood Young, op. cit. i. 47-9; cf.

III., cap, 22 and 23.The Government realised at a very early stage of the proceed-ings that its action would be open to objections. On the 23rd July Lord Ellenborough wrote to Lord Sidmouth: &quot; The custody of the tiger will be attended . . . with some trouble and embarrassment. The course to be pursued with him as to his immediate personal treatment is not difficult. It must, I think, be simple, yet with no unnecessary harshness in it. The omission-sion of any particle of caution by which he may be let loose upon the world again would be a crime of the highest magnitude, and of which I will not allow myself to suspect that any part of His Majesty&apos;s Government could be guilty.&quot;* Lord Liverpool, upbraided by Lord Holland &quot; with an act of harshness, so little of a piece with his general character and policy,&quot; only defended himself &quot;by the extreme difficulty of knowing what to do with such a prisoner, &quot;t On the 2nd August Lord Melville wrote to Lord Keith: &quot; We may possibly have to. apply to Parliament for their sanction to what we are doing respecting Buonaparte and the safe custody of his person, but we must do our duty in the meantime.   .   . This point of view was developedby Lord Eldon during the autumn of 1815.Lord Eldon was clearly embarrassed by the precipitate judg-ments of July;g and in September, 1815, wrote : &quot; I am unable to dispose of the difficulties attending Buonaparte&apos;s business. I have hitherto felt them so strongly as not finally to put the seal to the treaty the sovereigns have entered into at Paris.&quot;II Legal opinion was clearly much divided on the question. The first advice of the civilians was that Buonaparte should be regarded as a rebel and surrendered to his sovereign.1] This view was held by the Master of the Rolls, and was adopted by Lord Liverpool.** It was shared by Sir William Scott,tt but it was rejected upon political grounds. It became necessary, therefore, in view of the near approach of peace, to regularise the continued detention of Buonaparte by Great Britain. In September, Lord Eldon took the view that &quot; a Bill of Indemnity must be had for the whole, or nearly the whole, that has been finally done by others.&quot;JJ On 1st October, Lord Liverpool wrote: &quot; I am quite clear that, in whatever way the subject is viewed, it will be desirable to have an Act of Parliament to settle any doubts which may arise.&quot;* G.

During the subsequent weeks these views were gradually clarified and defined.The problem was not one of immediate concern. The Law Officers agreed in considering him to be a prisoner of war. Lord Elleuborough and Sir W. Scott agreed that he was either a subject of France, and we were at war with France, or a French rebel against whom we were assisting his sovereigns as allies. &quot; The war (whatever its character as to B.) had been yet put an end to by no treaty whatever.&quot; Lord Eldon agreed, therefore, that, if the Government, thought proper so to determine, it was entitled to keep him imprisoned &quot;till some peace is made by treaty with some person considered as his sovereign, or till some peace is made with him.&quot; The problem was whether, if a peace should be made with any sovereign whose subject he could be said to be, he could be excluded from that peace, or whether, when France could no longer crave our aid against him as a rebel, we and the Allies could confine him.Lord Ellenborough&apos;s view was that he should be regarded as &quot;an individual of the French nation at war with us; that individual an enemy to us (in common with the nation) whom we may, upon genera] principle, exclude from the benefit of a treaty of peace when we make it with the nation, continuing him, as far as we think.fit so to do, an individual enemy; and that individual to be considered also in a more special manner at war with us than individuals of belligerent nations usually are.&quot; Sn&apos;r William Scott, commenting upon this, opined that we had a right to surrender him to France as a rebel subject, but that to us he was a prisoner of war, and that there was a &quot; clear general rule of the law of nations that peace with the sovereign of a ,State is peace with all its subjects.&quot; Lord Eldon carried the matter a step further by raising the question whether Buona-parte was in fact to be considered as a French subject. We had not been at war with France as France. We had never professed to be the allies of the Bourbons. &quot; We have,&quot; he wrote, &quot; acted upon the notion that. . . . we are justified by the law of nations in using force to prevent his (B.&apos;s) being Governor of France; that ... we made war upon him and his adherents, * not as French enemies, not as French rebels, but as enemies to us and the Allies when France was no enemy to us; that in this war with him he has become a prisoner of war with whom we can make no peace, because we caw have no safety but in his imprisonment; no peace with him, or which includes him.&quot; And he concludes therefore: &quot;If Buonaparte can be separated from France, and can be considered neither as a subject of France nor a French rebel, then he has been subdued in legitimate war against him; and if so, I presume that we have a right to consider him as and to treat him as a prisoner of war (if we have not dealt with him on other termis) as long as we please.&quot; t* This was Lord Castlereagh&apos;s view; cf. Memorandum upon the Disposition of the Army of Buonaparte, 15th July, 1815, F.O. 92/21.t Lord Eldon to Sir W. Scott, No date. Twiss ; Life of ... Eldon, i. 538-541.
It was apparently upon these lines that the Acts of 1816 weie framed. They were entitled &quot; An Act for the more effectually detaining in custody Napoleon Buonaparte&quot; and &quot;An Act for regulating the intercourse with the Island of Saint Helena, during the time Napoleon Buonaparte shall be detained there; and for indemnifying persons in the cases therein mentioned.&quot; The first contained no indemnity clause and was presumably merely declaratory.The Bills* were introduced by Lord Castlereagh. He said &quot; doubts had been entertained whether it was competent to the Crown to detain Buonaparte a prisoner after the termination of the war.&quot; He himself did not share these doubts, &quot; yet the bill he proposed was deemed necessary.&quot; He did not share the doubts because, firstly, as to the legality of the proceeding, with reference to the law of nations, &quot; as a sovereign prince, we were warranted in detaining him in consequence of his breach of treaty and incapacity to afford any guarantee for the observance of a,ny treaty,&quot; and, as a prisoner of war, he was, &quot; as a native of Corsica, . . . a subject of France, which power had uc-clined to claim his restoration &quot;; and, secondly, upon political grounds his character warranted his detention.! Both Bills were passed without opposition.In the House of Lords, on the second reading, Lord Holland moved a postponement pending the receipt of the opinion of the judges. He opened upon the political question of the terms of the Convention of the 2nd August, 1815. Passing to the legal aspect of the matter, he complained that it was not clear whether the Bill was declaratory or necessary to give the power of detaining Napoleon, and that if the latter were the case, it was not clear what effect the enactment would have, and he asked that the following questions might be referred to the judges: &quot; 1st. What was the precise description of an alien enemy and an alien friend? 2nd. Whether any person could be con-sidered as an alien enemy who was not the subject of any State with whom we were at war. 3rd. Was an alien enemy taken in war entitled to Ms Habeas Corpus if detained after the signature of a treaty of peace with all the Powers or any of which he could be considered as a subject? 4th. Could any person be held as a prisoner of war who was not the subject of any known State ? 5th. Could any man be so detained who was the subject of a State with whom we were not at war? &quot;When the House was possessed of the opinion of the judges upon these points they would be in a position to appreciate the nature of the Bill. For, were it more than a declaratory measure, the consequence might be great confusion as to the position of the alien.Lord Bathurst, replying for the Government, confined himself in the main to the political issue and failed to answer the question of the nature and purpose of the Bill.   The motion was* 56 Geo. III. 22-23. Statutes at Large, vol. 56, pp. 62-4, 65-8 ; cf. App. IV. f Parl. Debates, xxxiii. 213-6.
defeated, and Lord Holland entered a protest in the Journals of ihe House, but, it is notable, omitted, in this protest, the legal aspect of the question. The further debate in Committee wa? confined almost solely to the policy of the Convention of 2nd August. *IV. The Case oe Savaiiy and Lallemand.Some light is thrown upon the detention of Napoleon Buonaparte by the proceedings in the case of Savary and Lallemand.Savary and Lallemand came on board the Bellerophon in company with Buonaparte. They appear from the first to have been apprehensive of falling into the hands of the Bourbon authorities. Upon this question they were reassured by Captain Maitland. &quot; 14th [July] . . . General Lallemand took occasion to ask me if I thought there would be any risk of the people who might accompany Buonaparte being given up to the French Government. I replied, &apos; Certainly not; the British Government never could think of doing so, under the circum-stances contemplated in the present arrangement.&apos; &quot;t This assurance was subsequently several times repeated.!Upon arrival at Plymouth these persons discovered from the newspapers that their names were included in the list of individuals proscribed by the French Government. Upon the 31st July they learnt that they had been excepted by the British Government from the persons whom Napoleon might select to accompany him to St. Helena, g They very naturally, and as it transpires very correctly, divined a connection between these two items of news, and were greatly agitated at the prospect which lay before them.Their names had been mentioned by Lord Castlereagh, in his letter to Lord Liverpool of the 24th July, as those of &quot; two very flagrant criminals,&quot; H and they were excepted from the persons from whom Buonaparte might select his suite as soon as it was found that their names were included in the list of prescription.^ &quot; We did so,&quot; writes Lord Bathurst, &quot; under the impression that we might, if we thought proper, surrender them to the French Government. This I explained to the French Ambassador, to whom, however, I at the same time said that circumstances might make it expedient for us not to surrender them. He answered that he was sure his Government would not make the demand if it was embarrassing to us,&quot;** Immediately upon the receipt of the news of their exception on the 31st July they took steps to secure, if possible, the reversal of that which they* Parl.

divined to be the policy of the Government. They wrote jointly to Maitland* and severally to Lord Keith, t while Savary wrote to Lord Melvillet and to Sir Samuel Romilly,J and prevailed upon Maitland to write to Lord Melville. $ The story is con-tinned in Sir Samuel Eomilly&apos;s &quot; Diary &quot;: &quot; 6th, Sun. I received a letter from General Savary . . . 7th, Mon. Having desired to see the Lord Chancellor this morning, before he went into Court, I apprized him of the letter I had received. I told him that Savary was an entire stranger to me, but that T thought myself bound, as he had no friends here, to do what I could for him; and that the only useful thing which it appeared to me that I could do, was, to make a representation to the Chan-cellor of what I had learned from him. I then stated to the Lord Chancellor the General&apos;s apprehensions that it was intended to deliver him up to the French Government; and that, when he went on board the Bellerophon, Captain Maitland had declared to him that he was authorised to receive him; and that he and those who accompanied him considered themselves as coming under the protection of the English laws; and that this indeed was expressly stated to them; and I here read to the Lord Chancellor the part of Savary&apos;s letter.in which this is affirmed. I told him that Savary had signified to Captain Maitland that nothing hut force should remove him from his ship, unless it were to pass under the protection of a magistrate; and this, too, I stated to the Lord Chancellor in Savary&apos;s own words. I also told him that when Savary entered on board the Bellerophon he recollected that our Ministers had themselves condemned the conduct of the Governor of Gibraltar with respect to the Spanish refugees; and I then showed the Chancellor the copies of Captain Maitland&apos;s letter to Lord Melville and of Savary&apos;s letters to Lord Keith and to Lord Melville. The Chancellor heard me with great attention. He then said that Captain Maitland&apos;s letter he had seen before, but the two other letters were new to him; that he believed there is no intention in Government to deliver up Savary or Lallemand to the French Government, but that he mentioned this to me in confidence and that it was not yet determined what was to be done with them.II He said that Captain Maitland had been directed to state exactly what passed between him and Buonaparte and his generals before he received them on board his ship; but that his statement in compliance with this requisition had not yet been, and could not have been, received. . . 8th. The Lord Chancellor sent for me into his room at Lincoln&apos;s Inn Hall, and said that he wished, before he went to the Council, that I should refresh his memory with what I had stated yesterday.   I did so, and wrote and delivered to him* P.O. 97/159. flbid.% Cf. Las Cases : Memorial de Sainte-Heleine, i, 54-5 ; cf. App. V. g Maitland: Narrative, 148-150.I Cf.

a copy of that part of Savary&apos;s letter, which states under what circumstances he, together with Buonaparte and Lallemand, were received on hoard the ship.&quot;*The sequel is given in a letter from Lord Bathurst to Lord Castlereagh, dated 25th August. &quot; On Savary and L&apos;Allemand finding themselves excepted, they naturally coupled it with the insertion of their names in the list, and became furious. They wrote the strongest letters of remonstrance and reproach, assert-ing that they had come on board with a direct promise of pro-tection, and so worked upon Captain Maitland as to induce him to write a letter to Lord Melville, which gave too much countenance to the declaration, although it did not distinctly confirm it. Under these circumstances, we thought their cases had become so doubtful that it appeared better to send them out of the way; and have therefore sent them to Malta, to be confined there as prisoners of war not on parole; but at the conclusion of this war their release must, I am afraid, be ordered. As our laws are strict as to questions of this nature, and the dis-position of the people alive on the subject, we are obliged to act with a delicacy which does not appear to be necessary in other countries.&quot;!   They were released in April, 1816.+V. The Congress or Aix-la-Chapexle, 1818.The fate of Napoleon was much discussed during&apos; the years which followed 1815, but the discussion was, in the main, directed to the question of his treatment at St. Helena. The letter directed to Sir Hudson Lowe by Montholon on the 25th August, 1816,1 adverted to the principle of detention, but except for the protest against the consideration of Napoleon as the common prisoner of .the Allies, added nothing- to the arguments of the protest of 18.15, and was principally concerned with complaints of harsh treat-ment. In the debate initiated by Lord Holland in the House of Lords in 1817(1 to test the veracity of the various accounts which were in. circulation respecting the state of affairs at St. Helena, and with more particular reference to the pamphlet^ to which Montholon&apos;s letter was added as an appendix, discussion of the principle of detention was deliberately avoided. But these protests and debates, and the campaign conducted by Napoleon&apos;s supporters in the Press, led to the revision of the whole subject at* Memoirs of the Life of Sir S. Romilly.

Aix-la-Cliapelle in 1818, and that revision resulted in further pronouncements upon the principle of detention as well as in a reply to the critics of British conduct at St. Helena.The Press had been industrious in representing the Emperor of Eussia in particular, and also the Emperor of Austria as highly incensed at the treatment received by Napoleon at St. Helena. And after the opening- of the congress letters were addressed to the Emperor of Russia by members of the Buonaparte family,* petitioning for a redress of their grievances and for the release of Napoleon. The matter was brought before the congress by the Emperor in a memorandum and a projet de protocoled They were the work of Pozzo di Borgo,* and were revised by Lord Castlereagh, and softened in tone,I notably by the substitution of the statement that &quot; Napoleon Buonaparte s&apos;est, par son propre fait, prive de tous les droits, autres que ceux que 1&apos;humanite reclame en sa faveur,&quot; for the statement that he was &apos; mis par le fait de sa conduite hors la loi des nations.&quot; As first drawn the protocol related both to Napoleon and to his family. It was signed by Lord Castlereagh with reservations as to both parts, virtually amounting in the case of the decisions relating to the Buonaparte family to a refusal of co-operation. 11 On further consideration the ministers in conference regarded; the latter reservation as so damaging that it was decided to separate the two questions. The protocol signed on the .19th November was withdrawn and a Protocole separe relatif a Bonaparte^ was signed on the 21st November. The memorandum annexed to- the protocol** described Buonaparte in 1815 as merely &quot; le chef d&apos;un force informe, sans caractere politique reconnu, et, en conse-quence, sans avoir aucun droit de pretendre aux avantages et aux egards dus a la puissance publique par les nations civilisees, meme lorsqu&apos;elle est tombee dans l&apos;infortune . . .

The island of St. Helena has been selected for his future residence. The climate is healthy, and its local situation will admit of his being- treated with more-indulgence than would be compatible with adequate security elsewhere.Of the persons who have been brought to England with General Buonaparte, he will be allowed to select (with the exception of Generals Savary and L&apos;Allemand) three officers, who, together with his surgeon, will be permitted to accompany him to St. Helena. Twelve domestics, including the servants of the Officers, will also be allowed. It must be distinctly under-stood that all those individuals will be liable to restraint during their attendance upon him and their residence at St. Helena, and they will not be permitted to withdraw from thence with-out the sanction of the British Government.Rear-Admiral Sir George Cockburn, who is appointed to the chief command at the Cape of Good Hope and the adjacent seas, will convey General Buonaparte and his attendants to St. Helena, and will receive detailed instructions respecting the execution of that service. Sir George Cockburn will probably be ready to embark in the course of a few days; it is, therefore, desirable that General Buonaparte should make without delay the selec-tion of the persons who are to accompany him.I have the honour to be, jfec,Melville. &quot;*Napoleon&apos;s Protest.&quot;Je proteste solennellement ici, a la face du Ciel et des hommes, contre la violence qui m&apos;est faite, contre la violation de mes droits les plus Sacres, en disposant par la force, de ma personne et de ma liberte.Je suis venu librement a bord du Bellerophon; je ne suis point prisonnier; je suis Phote de 1&apos;Angleterre.

APPENDIX V. Captain Maitland to Lord Melville.&quot;H.this. Bellerophon, Plymouth Sound, 31st July, 1815.My Lord,I am induced to address your Lordship in consequence of having observed, in the intimation delivered to Napoleon Buonaparte of the number of persons allowed to accompany him to the island of St. Helena, that the names of Savary and Lallemand are expressly excepted, which, together with their being proscribed in the French newspapers, has created in them a belief that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to deliver them up to the. King of France. Far be it from me to assume such an idea; but I hope your Lordship will make allowance for the feelings of an officer who has nothing so dear to him as his honour, and who could not bear that a stain should be affixed to a name he has endeavoured to hear unblemished. These two men, Savary and Lallemand (what their character or conduct in their own country may be I know not), threw themselves under the protection of the British flag; that protection was granted to them with the sanction of my name. It is true no conditions were stipulated for; but I acted in full confidence that their lives would be held sacred, or they should never have put foot in the ship I command without being made acquainted that it was for the purpose of delivering them ovej to the laws of their country.I again beg leave to repeat to your Lordship that I am far from supposing it to be the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to deliver these men over to the laws of their country; but, as they are strangely impressed with that belief, and I look upon myself as the cause of their being in their present situa-tion, I most earnestly beg your Lordship&apos;s influence may be exerted that two men may not be brought to the scaffold who claimed and obtained at my hands the protection of the British Rag.I have the honour to be, &amp;c.Fred L.

As the escape of Buonaparte to America may yet be effectuated, it is worth weighing every collateral aid that can be derived towards the accomplishment of this object [viz., security hereafter against the military ambition of France and the return of Buonaparte],&quot; The first that occurs, and it is one to which the Russian Minister inclines, is to address a strong note on the part of all the Allied Powers to the American Government, calling upon them to arrest and surrender Buonaparte to them. Such an appeal could do no harm; at the same time, I should expect little good to result from it. I do not see how the President could, of bis own authority, take such a step, and the utmost that our influence might, perhaps, accomplish, would be to effect his removal from the United States. It is, however, a measure worth considering, and I should be glad to be informed of the sentiments of the Government upon this point.&quot; J* Memoirs of  .   .  .

THIRD INTERIM REPORT.To The Right Hon. Sir Gordon Hewart, K.C., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Attorney-General.Sir,Since the presentation of the Second Interim Report to you on the 3rd June, 1919, the Committee have held three meetings, at which they received, considered and adopted the following Reports of the Sub-Committees for Offences on Land and in the Air, viz.:  (A) The Third Interim Report of the Sub-Committee for offences on Land, which dealt (inter alia) with the legal position of British prisoners of war according to International and German Law, and with Miss CavelPs case;(B) the Fourth Interim Report of the Sub-Committee for offences on Land, dealing further with the treatment of British prisoners of war on the Western Front;(0) the Fifth and Final Report of the Sub-Committee for Offences on Land dealing with the treatment of British prisoners of war in Bulgaria;(D) the Third Interim Report, of the Sub-Committee for Offences in the Air, dealing specially with the airship raid of 19/20 October, 1918, and the aeroplane raids of 6th and 18th December, 1918.At the meeting of the Main Committee on 21st July, 1919, Mr. Manisty, on behalf of the Sub-Committee for Offences at Sea, reported that in the opinion of the Sub-Committee, evidence of a conclusive character had been obtained identifying, the com-mander of the German submarine which had sunk the Hospital Ship &quot; Dover Castle.&quot;The evidence having been produced and considered it was unanimously agreed that the name of the commander should be scheduled for prosecution.The Committee desire to express their appreciation of the great sendees rendered by the Secretaries, Dr. Bellot and Mr. de Montmorency, whose assiduity, energy, wide knowledge and fruitful suggestions have,very much facilitated the Committee&apos;s labours.The Committee adjourned sine die, to meet again if and when the Attorney-General so desires.Signed on behalf of the Committee,JOHN MACDONELL,Chairman.J. H. MORGAN, Hugh H. L. Bellot, Vice-Chairman.J. E. G. de Montmorency, Secretaries.26th February, 1920. .
THIRD INTERIM REPORT OF THE STTB-COMMITTEE FOR OFFENCES ON LAND.Your Sub-Committee has, since the issue of its Second Interim Report on the 30th April, 1919, held thirty-six meetings. The case of Miss Edith Cavell has been carefully considered, and, having regard to the general interest in this case, a special report on it has been prepared which is annexed to this Report (Appendix No. IT). The treatment of British prisoners on the Western Front has been exhaustively considered, and will he the subject of a separate (Fourth) Interim Report. The Prisoners of War Camps on the German Eastern (Russian) Front have also received further investigation, and some additional names have been included in the-list of persons scheduled for prosecution. The complaints of British prisoners of war in Bulgaria have been par-tially considered, but, owing to the urgency of completing, as far&apos; as possible, the cases relating to prisoners of war in German hands, the Sub-Committee has postponed its consideration of the charges against Bulgarians. The Sub-Committee has also considered and rejected the only charge made against the Austrian authorities which has been brought to its attention.The main subject of the present Report is, however, the treat-ment of British prisoners of war in German camps. When the Sub-Committee came to-deal with this subject it found it necessary to have before it the provisions of the German military law relating to prisoners; and accordingly the requisite portions of the Compendium of Military Law on this subject were translated by Captain Somerset, and have been studied by the Sub-Committee.The Law on the Subject.No just appreciation of the treatment of the prisoners can be formed, nor can it be understood to what extent the German law was obeyed or disregarded, without some explanation of the legal position of the prisoners according to International and German law.International Law.The international law on the subject of the treatment of prisoners of war is to be found in Arts. 4 to 20, chapter 2, of the Land Warfare-Regulations annexed to the 4th Hague Convention of 1907. &apos;The Articles with which the Sub-Committee is chiefly concerned are Nos. 4, 6, 7 and 8. Art. 4 commences by laying down the general principle that &quot;prisoners must be humanely treated.&quot;
Art. 6 sanctions the employment of prisoners, other than officers, but only on two conditions, namely, &quot; that the work shall not be excessive,&quot; and that it &quot; shall have no connection with the opera-tions of the war.&quot; The wording of the second condition is very ambiguous, and it is not surprising that prisoners often misinter-preted their obligations under it. Art. 7 states that &quot; in default of special agreement between the belligerents, prisoners of war shall be treated as regards rations, quarters and clothing on the same footing as the troops of the Government which captured them.&quot; Art. 8 lays down that &quot; prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force in the army of the State in the power of which they are,&quot; and that &quot; any act of in-subordination justifies the adoption towards them of such measures of severity as may be considered necessary.&quot;German Law.By Section 158 of the &quot; Military Penal Code for the German Empire &quot; that code is made applicable &quot; to the offences of a prisoner of war according to the governing factor of his rank.&quot; He therefore became liable to all the penalties prescribed, and in addition was made liable by S. 9 (4) to the regulations for punish-able offences in the field when the senior commanding officer of his place of detention had proclaimed officially that the laws of war (Military Law?) apply to them. It appears clear from the evidence before the Committee that such proclamations were issued as a matter of routine.The penalties (other than disciplinary punishments) provided m the Code are death, imprisonment, close arrest, medium arrest, open arrest and confinement to quarters. The first two, apparently, can only be inflicted by Court Martial; the others can be inflicted summarily by the persons mentioned below.&quot;Confinement to quarters&quot; explains itself. By S. 24 it is provided that open, medium and close arrest are to be suffered in solitary confinement. The longest permissible sentence of close arrest is four weeks. In medium arrest, which may last from one day to six weeks (Notes to S. 25), the prisoner receives a plank bed and rations of bread and water. Close arrest is to be suffered in a dark cell and the additional penalties (plank bed and bread and water diet) are omitted on the fourth and eighth days, and afterwards on every third day (S. 26), while in medium arrest (S. 25) they are omitted on the fourth, eighth and twelfth days, and afterwards on every third day.It is not necessary to go through all the provisions of the Military Penal Code which create offences, but it is desirable to direct attention to the Sixth Division of that code, which creates the punishable offences against the duties of military sub-ordination,&quot; because it was under one or other of the sections contained, in this division that heavy sentences were passed on prisoners guilty of insubordination.   It must be borne in mind
that every German soldier was as was so often insisted the military superior of every prisoner of war.By Section 89 any person who, in respect of a service matter, is guilty of a breach of the respect due to a superior and, in particular, makes open complaint or answers back on reproof is punishable with arrest. If the breach of respect was committed under arms, or in the presence of an assembly, or took the form of a threat, the minimum- sentence is 14 days&apos; close arrest, and the sentence may be imprisonment or detention in a fortress up to three years. Lies are punishable with arrest (S. 90), insults with imprisonment for two years or, in certain circumstances, three years (S. 91). If the insult is by published writings, exhibitions, or caricatures a sentence of five years&apos; imprisonment may be passed (S. 91). Disobedience is punishable by arrest (S. 92); if con-siderable detriment is actually caused by it the punishment is 14 days&apos; close arrest or imprisonment in a fortress up to 10 years, or if the danger of detriment is produced then the penalty is imprisonment up to two years (S. 93). Express refusal of obedi-ence or persistent disobedience incurs a penalty of 14 days&apos; close arrest or imprisonment up to three years (S. 94).If the offences last mentioned (S. 94) were committed in the presence of an assembly then the penalty is imprisonment or detention in a fortress up to five years (S. 95), and the same penalty is incurred for laying violent hands or attempting a personal attack on a superior in the presence of assembled troops, or if a weapon or dangerous implement has been used, but in less serious cases imprisonment for not less than one year; while if the offence is that of attacking or attempting to attack a superior officer simpliciter the penalty is imprisonment for not less than three years, or, in less serious cases, for six months (S. 97). If the act took place in the field (it will be remembered that all prisoners are liable to be treated as in the field) the penalty is death, or in less serious cases imprisonment for life, or not less than 10 years (S. 97). This sentence may be modified if a &quot;subordinate has been exasperated by the fact that his superior has treated him in a manner contrary to the regulations or overstepped the bounds of service authority and on the spot has been driven to commit the offences&quot; above mentioned. In such a case, if a penalty of death or imprisonment for life has been incurred, a sentence of not less than 10 years&apos; imprisonment is to be passed; and there are other provisions for reducing the period of imprisonment incurred for offences committed in ^similar circumstances (S. 98).If several persons conspire to effect a joint refusal of obedience, or a joint resistance, or an attack on a superior they may be punished as for mutiny (S. 103), i.e., with hard labour for life or, if in the field, death (Article of War, 14), or may be punished as for the commission of the crime which the offenders conspired to commit, with the addition of from three months&apos; to two years&apos; imprisonment,
If several persons gather in a mob, and with united forces endeavour to refuse obedience to a superior, this amounts to a military riot, and is punished with imprisonment for not less than five years, in the field not less than ten years (S. 106). The ringleaders may be punished with hard labour for life or in the field with death (S. 107)..It was under one of the sections above mentioned that prisoners who refused to work or struck or attempted to strike guards received the savage sentences passed on them; often the Courts Martial had no alternative but to pass the sentence. These heavy sentences could, of course, only be passed by Court Martial. Some of the proceedings of these Courts Martial have reached the Sub-Committee, and it should be stated that, though the con-clusions arrived at may have been wrong, the long-reasoned judg-ments are calculated to give an impression of fairness and of a desire to do justice in accordance with the very severe code the Courts were bound to administer.There are provisions (see with Division, S. 114 et seq.) for punishing persons who were guilty of the &quot; abuse of service authority,&quot;. under which guards and others who ill-treated prisoners were occasionally punished.But while the law as administered by Courts Martial affected only a small proportion of the prisoners, every one of them was subject to, and most of them at one time or another suffered under, the wide disciplinary powers of the Commandants, who were invested with the powers of summary punishments.By Section 5 of the &quot; Regulations relating to disciplinary punishments &quot; disciplinary power is given to such officers as have &apos;&apos; command 0&quot;\*er a detachment of troops, over a particular commando ... or over a military institution with respon-sibility for discipline &quot; and &quot; extends to the subordinates of this command.&quot; By Section 6 it is provided that the power to award disciplinary punishments is bound up, not with the service rank, but with the service appointment.Prisoners of war are made subject to disciplinary punishments by Section 2 (IT).A number of disciplinary punishments is set out in Section 3, but those appropriate to prisoners of war appear to be only extra fatigues and parades, medium arrest up to three weeks, close arrest up to 14 days and confinement to quarters. It seems, however  though the Sub-Committee has been unable to verify this that in certain circumstances field punishment can be lawfully sub-stituted for arrest, and (S. 47) such punishment for two hours&apos; daily certainly may be added to close arrest. Field punishment which appears to be the official description of &quot; post punishment &quot; is thus described in Section 48: &quot; Field punishment of a person &quot; under arrest takes place in a manner not detrimental to the &apos;&apos; health of the same, namely, in an upright position with the back &quot; turned to a wall or a tree, in such a manner that the soldier can
&quot;neither sit nor lie down. Two hours of field punishment &quot; together with the presence of the arrested person on sentry-go &quot; are equivalent to one day&apos;s close arrest.&quot; &quot;In such a manner &quot;that the soldier can neither sit nor lie down&quot; seems to hav? received a construction according to the will of the Feldwebel in charge. The prisoner was always tied to a post or tree, sometimes with his feet, sometimes with only his toes, on the ground, and not infrequently a brick was placed under his feet and removed when the man had been securely tied, and occasionally his arms were secured above his head.No justification (unless the word &quot;parade&quot; is suffieienltly comprehensive) has been discovered for the long periods during which the men were forced to stand to attention (&quot; still stand &quot;) in all conditions of weather, heat and cold, extending sometimes throughout the night up to 15 or 16 hours at a stretch a punish-ment which was imposed in many of the working.camps..The offences for which disciplinary, punishments could be im-posed are thus described.in.Section 1:-(1) &quot;Offences against military deportment and order and against service regulations for which the military laws &apos;   contain no precise provisions. -  &apos; - &apos;;(2) &quot; Those military misdemeanours the punishment of which is expressly permitted by disciplinary channels in less serious cases.&quot;Of the 19 offences included in the second category a number could not be committed by prisoners of war. Those which could be committed are the following:  :: &apos;(1) A breach of the respect due to a superior on duty or in relation to a service matter, including open complaints or answering back when reproved.  .(2) The same misdemeanour if. the offence was committed under arms or in the presence of the assembled, troops, or appears to have taken the form Of a threat.(3) False statements made to a superior in reply to a question on service matters. ^      -&apos; &apos; 1 - &apos;   : ^(4) An insult to a superior or to a person higher in service!, rank, when it is not a slander nor has been committed by the spreading abroad of writings, representations, or caricatures.(5) Disobedience to an order in service matters by non-observance or by unauthorised alteration [of* it] or by exceeding it.(6) The same misdemeanour when thereby a Considerable detriment has been caused or the danger of a consider-able detriment has been brought about. ,       - / n(7) Express refusal of obedience, making known disobedience .$f-V-        by words, gestures or other actions, insolent, replies
292to the order or reprimand of a superior, persistence in disobedience when an order in service matters has repeatedly been received. (8) Intentional and unlawful damage, destruction or neglectof service property. (9) Escape of a prisoner where desertion is not charged. (10) Leaving without permission the position assigned in a commando or on the march.It will thus be seen that the Commandant of a working camp, who might well be an ignorant, prejudiced non-commissioned officer, had large powers of punishment, and that the range of offences which fell within his jurisdiction was so wide that, as he was the sole interpreter of the regulations, the most trivial acts or omissions might entail quite severe penalties, such as four-teen days of solitary confinement in a pitch dark cell on a bread and water diet, and field punishment.The above summary of the legal position of a prisoner of war would hardly be complete without reference to the statement frequently made by the more brutal commandants, that a prisoner of war had no rights, a theory on which, though incorrect, they undoubtedly acted. But the prisoners had rights, as was recognised by the better commandants. Being subject to the military law they had a right, which they shared with the prosecutor, to appeal against a Court Martial sentence, and also under Section 52 of the law relating to disciplinary punishments, to complain of a disciplinary punishment, but &quot;only when the *l sentence has been carried out,&quot; and &quot; without the co-operation &quot; of a third person; &quot; while by Section 53 it is provided that &quot; if &quot; complaints are rejected as unfounded . . . it is to be con-&quot; sidered in each case whether the maintenance1 of discipline does &quot; not render necessary proceedings against the person making the &quot;complaint.&quot; It often was considered necessary, apparently, and the man received further punishment for complaining.So far an attempt has been made to explain the legal position; but, severe as the law was, it was not properly administered in the bad camps. A diligent search through the German manual of Military Law has failed to disclose any justification. for much which was done in the bad camps. Men were kicked, spat upon and beaten with sticks, whips, clubs, mining hammers, and india-rubber tubing, sometimes wound round with wire. One witness grimly observes that the unteroffizier at a mining camp broke so many long handled mining hammers over the prisoners that he took to a rubber tubing as being1 less fragile.Even assuming that the Feldwebel was lawfully inflicting punishments, a perverse ingenuity often added to their severity. At Sennelager, for instance, the prisoners were forced in broiling summer weather to stand to attention on ; hot asphalted robfs; at many coalmines they were made to stand&apos; to attention before coke ovens where they were nearly roasted. In&apos; Courland; they veJetied to trees.in the-middle of a -mosquito infested&apos; country
where the tortures the men suffered from mosquito bites are indescribable. The dark cells in which men had to pass their period of arrest were in several instances constructed in close proximity to the main steam pipe of the works and were so hot that after a short time the men had to strip themselves almost to the skin. After enduring this they would sometimes be made to stand to attention in an exposed position for hours without overcoat in the freezing atmosphere of a winter night.The existence of such a hot cell at Husten was the subject of complaint through the Dutch Minister at Berlin. The German authorities admitted the existence of the hot cell but added &quot;it was sometimes warm but never unbearably hot,&quot; a point on which, in the opinion of the Sub-Committee, a person who has been confined there is a better judge than an officer sitting in a comfortable room at the Kriegsministerium in Berlin.Another plan practised in at least three working camps, Grasleben, Gross Iselde and Ehmen, was to keep prisoners who had been sentenced to arrest for some disciplinary offence at work all the week and to place them in the cells for the 24 hours of Sunday, so that 14 days&apos; arrest took over three months to work off.The Commandant at Hamelburg authorised in that camp and in the working camps attached to it the infliction of solitary con-finement for periods of 60 hours without food or water, and in one case at least this was imposed for two periods with an interval of only one hour between them. This was admitted by the German Notes Yerbales of January 14th and February 24th, 1918, though it is said to have been contrary to the regulation and never to be &quot;imposed in full if the prisoner agrees to go back to work.&quot; Dr. Romer, the Dutch Inspector, on his visit in October, 1918, actually found six men who had refused to work undergoing this punishment, each of whom has, since his repatria-tion, made a statement.This case illustrates the undoubted fact that the Commandants of the main camps did and authorised to be done many things contrary to the regulations and even against the directions of the supreme authority. It is difficult to understand the position either of the Generals Commanding the Army Corps Districts or of the Commandants of the Main Camps, who seem in some respects to enjoy an independence unknown to persons in a similar position in this country.While the prisoners suffered severely in some places through the infliction for disciplinary offences of lawful punishments often with illegal additions, there can be no doubt that their every day existence was embittered by the way in which the sentries used the weapons with which they were armed.In the Regulations for the Ilnd Army Corps District (s&amp;e 2nd Interim Report, p. 289) explicit instructions are laid down with regard to the use of arms. They are so important that they are set out in full.   It will be observed that they are based on, a
general Military Order, and were therefore presumably in force in all the working camps:  &quot; The regulations for the use of arms by the guard are &quot; comprised in the order on the use of arms by the military &quot;issued 19th March, 1914.&quot; The guard is allowed to use his arms-&quot; (1) If he is actually attacked.&quot; (2) If he is seriously threatened with an attack, i.e.,&quot; his safety jeopardised. &quot; (3) If he meets with actual resistance. &quot; (4) If resistance is offered to him by means of a dan-&quot; dangerous threat with assault in order to ward off &quot; assault or to overcome the resistance. &quot; (5) If obstinate disobedience is maintained to the &quot; order or prohibition of the guard and he cannot &quot;enforce obedience in any other way. &quot; (6) If a prisoner escapes or tries to escape. &quot; (7) In the protection of objects or persons (prisoners) &quot; committed to his charge, or in order to prevent &quot; or obviate any interruption of his official duties &quot; by a third person. &quot; In all cases the butt-end of the rifle and blank ammuni-&quot; tion are first to be used.&quot; Shooting is only to be resorted to in the most urgent &quot; cases: &quot; (a) If the blank ammunition is not sufficient to attain &quot; the object.&quot;(6) In. cases of escape, or attempted escape, after he &quot; has called * Halt! &apos; once in a loud voice. &quot;Auxiliary guards are allowed to use arms on the same &quot; lines as guards; but, not being the military superiors of &quot; the prisoners, they may not use arms as in paragraph No. 5. &quot; They must, should their orders or prohibitions meet with &quot; obstinate disobedience, report the case to the guard or the &quot; camp kommandantur, who will then deal further with the &quot; matter.&quot; The weapon is with the exception of orders and prohibi-&quot; tions the extreme, but also the only, means of coercion of &quot; the guard.&quot; Blows with the hand or fist, or with sticks or clubs, and &quot; kicks are forbidden.&quot;Except in most exceptional and unusual cases, it is in-&quot; excusable to lay hands on a prisoner.&quot;Although the Sub-Committee has not obtained copies of any general instructions other than those in force in the Ilnd Army Corps District, other documents have reached it from other districts which show clearly the German attitude in the matter of the use of arms. In June, 1916, Drs. Ohnesorg and McCarthy (American Inspectors) visited the working camp Muckenburg II attached to Wittenberg in the IYth Army Corps District and
investigated the complaint of a man who on the plea of illness had refused to work and had been violently struck in the back with the butt of the sentry&apos;s rifle. They were shown by the Unteroffizier in charge the orders set out in their report, in German, of which the following is a translation:  &quot; Notice is hereby given that on refusal to work the guard &quot; have been directed in future, if occasion arises, to make use &quot;of their weapons.&quot; This was signed by the Commandant of Wittenberg Camp.Another order, written in German, was posted in the guard house:  &quot; The guards are especially enjoined energetically to keep &quot; the prisoners at work. Should the attitude of the prisoners &quot; demand the use of the weapon this should be employed &quot;without regard to consequences. In the first place the &quot;bayonet only is to be employed.&quot;A prisoner from a camp at Dortmund, in the Tilth Army Corps District, says, &quot; Amongst the rules put up in the camp was one &quot; saying the sentries had full powers to use their arms against any &quot; prisoner who disobeyed any order.&quot;; and from a farm in Amt Weiler under Wahn, in the VIIIth  Army Corps District, comes an instructive notice, dated March, 1916, which was posted up there. After stating that it had been proved that an order of the 3rd February regarding stricter treatment was not being carried out, the notice proceeds as follows :  &quot; Prisoners of war must be justly but firmly treated. Proper maintenance, clothing, accommodation and medical .; treatment must be provided.  But every prisoner must work hard, and for this the guard is responsible.   Guards who do not do their duty in this respect will, in addition to possibly further severe punishments, have their extra commando pay stopped.   The officers in charge are themselves liable to , punishment if they do not report dilatory guards.&quot; Officers in charge are given authority, in cases where discipline and the keeping to work demand it, &quot;at once to inflict the necessary punishments,&quot; and the notice ends: &quot; This order is to be impressed upon the guard every week at Roll Call.&quot;The actual orders have, it will be observed, been obtained from only four different Army Corps Districts, but the evidence before the Sub-Committee satisfies it that in substance similar orders were in force in all the districts.As a result of these orders many men were seriously injured, and not a few killed. In all ninety-four cases of violent death arising as a result of them have been investigated.These - regulations show the working of the German military &apos; machine. A man trained to believe that any German soldier is superior to any prisoner, himself perhaps entirely ignorant of his prisoner&apos;s language, armed with a deadly weapon, enjoined &quot;energetically to keep the prisoners at work,&quot; to &quot;make use of his weapons if occasion arises,&quot; and &quot;without regard to the ;
consequences,&quot; is placed in the position of being at the same time witness, judge and executioner, almost certain of support from his superiors should he take extreme steps within the four corners of these orders.No real complaint could be made if, in the case of insubordina-tion or refusal to work in an employment to which they could properly be put, prisoners of war had been punished in accordance with the Military Law of Germany, but the law must be administered with humanity.That this is the true position has been explicitly recognised by a German Commission which has been sitting in Berlin to investigate the charges of breaches of International Law made by the Allies. In their report upon the Langensalza incident, which occurred after the Armistice, when prisoners, who, believing that they had a right to do so, were pulling down a building, were fired on, the Commission, after finding that it was impossible to discover who gave the order to fire, proceeds to refer to the provision of The Hague Convention, making prisoners subject to the Military Law of the Captor State and to the provisions of the German law relating to the use of arms set out above, under which the sentries were justified in firing. &quot; Thus,&quot; the Commission states, &quot; no charge of unauthorised employment &quot; of force of arms can be brought against the German camp guard &quot; in respect of their action on 27th November, 1918, and con-&quot; sequently there can be no question of punishable conduct on ;&apos;their part.&quot;&quot; Nevertheless the Commission has felt constrained to find &quot; (admit) a breach of International Law.&quot;&apos;&apos; Notwithstanding the fact that the Captor State has the right, 1&apos; as above stated, to impose upon the persons in question obedience &quot;to its laws and regulations as laid down for its own Army, and &apos;&apos; to requite any insubordination with the requisite vigour, &apos;&apos; Chapter 4, Clause 2 (of The Hague Convention) provides that &quot; it shall treat its prisoners humanely. This underlying &apos;&apos; principle ... must be regarded as the head and front &quot; of all the provisions laid down for the determination of the &apos;&apos; judicial status of prisoners of war.&quot;It is manifestly for this reason that it has been placed &quot;immediately after the provisions laid down relative to the sub-&quot; mission of prisoners of war to the Captor State, and is given &quot; precedence over all other regulations regarding prisoners of &quot; war in Chapter 4 of The Hague Agreement. From this it follows &quot; that in this proviso enjoining humane treatment a moral limita-&quot;tion is placed on the laws of any country relative to the &quot; employment of arms against prisoners of war, even though such &quot;prisoners are primarily subjected to such under the provision &apos;&apos; of Chapter 4 of the Hague Agreement.&quot;; The Commission found that in the case before them the regula-tions had been applied thoughtlessly and without due regard to the lamentable consequences, seeing that no competent leaders were available for the guard.
The principle thus lucidly stated most certainly was not followed in the bad camps. There the prisoners were not treated with humanity, nor were they treated even in accordance with the German Military Law. There was an absence of competent leadership which in numerous cases led to gross ill-treatment.How far the superior officers can be held responsible for the ill-treatment above-mentioned it is difficult to say. General von Bissing at Minister seems to have been a reasonable man and, where he was allowed by his subordinates to know the facts, to have been even considerate.But the following notice which he issued can hardly have had the result of alleviating the lot of the prisoners of war who were under his command :  &quot; Stellvertretendes,&quot; Generalkommando, &quot; 7, Armeekorps, &quot; Munster, 12th October, 1914.&quot; (rabies. lid. Nr. 557.)&quot; Notice.&apos;&apos; The German soldiers who are held as prisoners of war in &quot; France and England are at some places, it is ascertained, &quot;treated in a thoroughly unworthy and sometimes even &quot;shameful manner. Even doctors and nurses of the German &quot; Medical Service who come under the protection of the lied &apos;&apos; Cross have in single cases been treated contrary to the law &quot; of nations.&apos;&apos; Such conduct towards defenceless prisoners of war &quot;deserves the severest condemnation. It seems that in &apos;&apos; France and England one does not fear that German mili-&quot; tary authorities may repay evil for evil. Certainly we &quot; Germans will never ill-treat prisoners, for we are proud of 1&apos; being civilised people.&quot; As long as the foreign prisoners of war behave themselves &quot; in a willing and respectable manner they have nothing to &apos;&apos; fear from us Germans, they will then be treated as honour-&quot; able soldiers who have worthily fought for their country. &quot;But those prisoners who do not conform to military dis-&apos;&apos; decipline or who shew themselves in any way insubordinate &quot;will be most severely punished. Woe to them who try to &quot; escape their fate by flight&apos; At any attempt to escape the &quot; guards will immediately make use of their rifles. All the &quot;guards are to be regarded as superiors to the prisoners. &quot;They are earnest men knowing their duty, to whom the &quot;watching is a matter of conscience, and they know what &quot;they have to do, and what they have not to do. All the &quot; same, it has been again impressed upon them that they &quot;expose themselves to heavy punishment if they allow to the
&quot;prisoners any privileges which are not permitted. This &quot; every prisoner is to know. Therefore, protection and &quot;decent treatment for all respectable prisoners in our &quot; encampments! We Germans will never repay those who &quot; maltreat our sons with similar treatment of theirs. Of &quot; that, anyone who wishes to do so, may inform his people at &quot; home.&quot; The General Commanding,&quot; Freiherr von Bissing,&quot;General of Cavalry.&quot;Another document which has reached the Sub-Committee is not ypen to any favourable construction. A week after a batch of British prisoners arrived at Alt Auz on the Eastern Front, No. 31 of &quot; Der Flieger,&quot; dated 8th July, 1917, was issued to the German troops of the Flying School at that place. A copy of this was fortunately obtained, and contains an article of which the following is a translation:  &quot; more pride.&apos;&apos; A few days ago&apos; new prisoners of war have come to us  &quot; English Comrades shew them that you are Germans, do &quot; not forget that there are among you men who: stood opposite &quot; to the English with weapons in their hands. Think of the &quot;treatment our prisoners received at the &apos; Kiver Ancre.&apos; &quot; By paid men of the English. Think of your comrades of &quot; the &apos; Airship&apos; L. 18, who, when capsized, were driven by &quot; the waves on the high seas and were left by the crew of the &quot; &apos; King Stephen &apos; cold and without feeling to their fate, the &quot; waves took their bodies, but their spirits are going about &quot; preaching to hate the murderers. Do you not close your &quot;fist when you hear the word &apos;Baralong&apos;? Where the &quot; English in Beastly Barbarity shot down German youths &quot; who were wrestling with the waves. No mercy for such &quot;Scoundrels] Shew yourselves to them as Germans! As &quot;cmen&apos; shake off every false pity. They are and will &quot; remain English, and we shall hate them as long as German &quot; blood flows through our veins.&quot; comrades be proud.&quot;Procedure oe Sub-Committee. (1) Materials.The real significance of this Report, so far as it relates to charges in respect of the treatment of prisoners of war in Ger-many, cannot be appreciated without some statement as to the material at the disposal of the Sub-Committee and the steps which have been taken to deal with it.
Since its appointment in 1915, the &quot; Government Committee on the Treatment by the Enemy of British Prisoners of War &quot; has examined, exclusive of prisoners captured by the Turks, Austrians and Bulgarians, 3,038 N.C.O.S and men, 445 officers and 90 medi-cal officers in all 3,573 persons who, after being confined as prisoners, have returned from Germany. This was done either through a body of examiners organised by Mr. Hughes Onslow, a master of the Supreme Court, by that Committee^ Hon. Secretary, by the members of the Com-mittee, or by officers detailed for that purpose in Switzerland and Holland. Nearly the; whole of this evidence has been printed. After the Armistice that Committee was requested by the Govern-ment to arrange that all the repatriated prisoners should have the fullest opportunity of making any complaints which they desired to make with regard to their treatment. A form of questionnaire, (of which a copy (numbered I) is in the appendix) was prepared, and a sufficient number issued to enable every returned prisoner to make a statement. A Staff was sent clown to the two Concentra-tion Camps at Dover and Eipon, and each batch of prisoners as it returned was addressed by the person in charge of the investiga-tion and asked to state frankly what complaint they had to make.Whether because they had no serious complaints to make, or because they would not take the trouble, or because they washed to get home as quickly as possible, a very large number did not in fact send in the forms. Out of the 170,000 or 180,000 forms issued only some 59,000 were returned, and of these only about 22,000 contained information of any value to the Sub-Committee.Turning now to the number of places in which British prisoners were confined, there were in Germany, in addition to nearly 300 hospitals, some 135 main camps, of which 57 were for officers and 78 for men. From these main camps for men prisoners were sent to different working camps or commandos. During the summer of 19.18 the German authorities handed to the Dutch Minister a list which purported to show all the working places in which British prisoners were confined, arranged under the different parent camps in the Army Corps districts, which number 22. The list is admittedly incomplete. With regard to five Army Corps districts, the names of the places where British prisoners were detained were not given at all. In the remaining districts the list, though substantially accurate, is not quite complete. There appear in the list 7,157 places; in 4,423 not more than two British prisoners are stated to be confined, while in 1,188 there were 10 or more. At many of the camps where there were only a few British prisoners there were numerous prisoners of other nationalities. It wall therefor j be apparent that there were in all certainly not less than 7,500 places, exclusive of hospitals, with regard to which complaints might have been made. There were also the camps behind the Western Front, which are not included in the German list, and which will be dealt with in a separate report.In addition to the evidence of the returned prisoners there is a large number of reports received through the American Embassy
and the Dutch Legation, by the neutral inspectors, who inspected the main camps, hospitals and working camps. These cannot number less than 1,000, of which 649 deal with working camps. All these reports were at the disposal of the Sub-Committee.In order to deal with this mass of material the following arrangements were made:  A Staff was organised under Mr. E, A. Armstrong, barrister-at-law, to sort, index and arrange the papers. As soon as the papers were sufficiently arranged, he, with the assistance of some competent barristers, solicitors and others, prepared a precis of the evidence relating to each camp, or to each incident, such as the killing of a prisoner. This precis, together with the evidence upon which it was based and the report (if any) of the Neutral visitor, was sent to the Sub-Committee, and was investigated by some member of the Sub-Committee, who prepared a report in the form of which a copy will be found in the appendix (numbered II), and presented it to the Sub-Committee, who thereupon decided whether or not any person should be scheduled for prosecution.The whole of this material has been indexed with cross-references, and will be available for the purpose of preparing the case against those against whom it is decided to proceed.The total number of places in the interior of Germany where British prisoners were sent to work with regard to which com-r plaints have been made in the statements referred to above is 929, divided as follows: mines 486, quarries 75, factories 248, agriculture&apos; forestry and the like 120 say in round numbers 930. Of these 930, either because the complaint was trivial or because the evidence was insufficient, or because such evidence as was available disclosed no offence, the Sub-Committee has rejected all but 349 in which the evidence was sufficient to warrant a detailed examination. From among these the Sub-Committee has in 196 cases from 127 places recom-mended proceedings to be taken against one or more persons. A list of the persons inculpated, together with a case paper relating to each case in the form appearing in the appendix (II), has been furnished to the Law Officers.In addition to the above, the Sub-Committee has investigated complaints against 32 main camps, 4 hospitals and 6 officers&apos; camps and 7 places in Africa. It has not recommended pro-ceedings against any persons in respect of these places other than one in Africa.The above figures do not include the cases of violent death in regard to which it has been suggested a charge of murder might be preferred. Of these cases the Sub-Committee has investigated 94; but in only 10 has it found that the available evidence, would be likely to establish a charge of murder.; In the remainder the Sub-Committee has been of opinion that the evi-dence was insufficient, or that the men lost their lives in the course of resistance to constituted authority, or when attempting to escape, or that there were other circumstances which rendered a prosecution impossible.
(2) Principles acted upon.The principles upon which the Sub-Committee has acted may . be summarized as follows. The Solicitor-General attended a Meeting of the Sub-Committee and informed them that it was desired only to have a list of cases of &quot; outstanding wickedness,&quot; of acts which would &quot; shock humanity,&quot; and the Sub-Committee was requested only to report &quot; clear &quot; cases, i.e., cases in which the evidence, as it stands, would ensure conviction. It may be that in some cases further investigation would establish a charge which at present seems doubtful, but the Solicitor-General in-formed the Sub-Committee that owing to the limited time available it was not desired that it should seek for further evidence than that which was already at its disposal except where, on the existing evidence, there was good ground for believing that the case was a very bad one. In accordance with this direction the Sub-Committee has only in a few cases sought for further evidence.In many cases there are only one or two statements in support of the complaint which is made; and, when the evidence is so exiguous, the Sub-Committee has not thought it right to act upon it. In many other cases the evidence is conflicting or incon-sistent and the Sub-Committee has found it impossible to say that these cases are &quot; clear,&quot; or that the evidence as a whole is such as would ensure a conviction. In other cases the treatment complained of was the result of insubordination or a refusal to&apos; do work which prisoners of war might legitimately be required to do, and in these cases also the Sub-Committee, as a general rule, has refrained from recommending prosecution.Insubordination sometimes caused the imposition of additional restrictions and discomforts and gave the German authorities the opportunity, and even on some occasions the right, to impose harsh disciplinary measures, which fell upon the innocent as well as upon the actual offenders. In many cases failure to obey orders, especially in the case of the rank and file, was due to ignorance of the German language and customs, inability to read orders when posted up, the profound difference between the German and the English systems of discipline, and, above all, to the belief, which it is impossible not to admire, though it is also impossible to admit it in all cases as a ground of excuse for indiscipline, that it was patriotic to hamper the German authorities wherever possible. In cases when the prisoners of war were ordered to per-form tasks, such as the handling of munitions of war, calculated-directly to assist the German &quot;armies in the field, this belief was well-founded.It is evident that considerable misapprehension existed in the minds of British prisoners as to the kinds of work which they might properly be required to perform, particularly in connec-tion with munitions. It is established that British prisoners wew sometimes called upon to do work which was illegal.  They often.
however, objected to carry out orders which were perfectly legitimate.It should also be recorded that the evidence in support of charges against German hospitals and the medical men therein is such as to make prosecution practically impossible. In the early stages of the war hospital accommodation was very insurti-cient, but this defect was largely remedied so far as the main camps were concerned by the erection of new hospital buildings, though there was an increasing scarcity of proper medical and surgical appliances, which was prevalent throughout Germany. In any case charges of inhumane treatment by doctors are very difficult to prove, especially when the evidence consists of state-ments by persons who have no experience of medicine or surgery.There is a considerable number of cases in which prisoners of war were shot or otherwise hilled by guards or officers in charge of camps. In many of them the evidence shows that there was a fight or a struggle between the prisoner and the guard, or a refusal to obey orders, or an attempt to escape, while in others the evidence only shows that the prisoner was killed, and in others identification of the offender is impossible. In such cases the Sub-Committee has not found it possible to recommend prosecution.The Sub-Committee has also thought that allowance should be made for the difficulty of organising proper accommodation for the prisoners in the early part of the War. No doubt the prisoners were exposed to great hardships in 1914 and the early part of 1915, when reasonable accommodation had not been pre-pared by the German authorities for the large number of prisoners who were captured. But, so far as the main camps were concerned, conditions were greatly improved by the middle of 1915; and the Sub-Committee considers that prosecutions should not be instituted in respect of bad accommodation in the earlier period. So, too, a very large proportion of the prisoners5 complaints relates to the quantity and quality of the German food supplied, and to the method of cooking it. These objections were substantially mitigated by the system of parcels; and, as to tbe quantity and quality of the food supplied by the Germans, the Sub-Committee, in view of the fact that Germany suffered severely from lack of food, has not thought proper to recommend prosecu-tions merely on the ground of insufficient food. Where, as on the Western Front, a totally insufficient food supply (parcels not being generally forwarded) was accompanied by the exaction of hard manual labour, the question is very different.The Sub-Committee also considered it impossible to formulate any charge in regard to disciplinary punishments inflicted on British prisoners which, although excessive according to the British regulations, were authorised by the far more rigorous regulations in force in Germany. But there are many cases where the punishments inflicted, e.g,, beating with sticks and Tubber-piping, were prohibited by the German regulations; and in
these cases the Sub-Committee has, where the treatment was .  systematic and the evidence establishes its seriousness, scheduled the offenders for prosecution.(3) General.Since the lists were furnished to the Law Officers, it has been iiound necessary to make two modifications in them. One man was scheduled for prosecution on the charge of murder of a British prisoner; but the report of the Enquiry held by the German authorities in this case, which has recently reached the Sub-Com-mittee, is such as to render it expedient not to proceed further with this. charge; and the Law7 Officers have accordingly been informed that in the. view of the Sub-Committee it is desirable that this case should be withdrawn from the list. The Sub-Com-mittee also included in the list the General in command of a main camp which was visited by an epidemic, and the Principal Medical Officer of the camp. But recently the report of the German Com-mission which investigated this case has come to hand; and from this report it appears that the General is dead, and that the doctor contracted spotted fever in the discharge of his duties, while from other statements in the report it appears that there will be a serious conflict of testimony on the facts. In these circum-stances, the Sub-Committee considered that this case should be abandoned, and the Law.Officers have accordingly been informed of that fact,A question, of some difficulty arose in connection with the officers&apos; camps in the Hanover Command. After long, considera-tion and with some divergence of opinion, the Sub-Committee by a majority came to the conclusion that these were not cases in * which, having regard to the instructions which the Sub-Com-mittee had received, prosecutions should be recommended. Each of the camps was considered separately, and then the question whether a charge should be made against the Higher Command was investigated; and a copy of the report on this last question which was adopted by the Sub-Committee will be found in the appendix (numbered III). A minority of the Sub-Committee was of opinion that General von Hanisch was responsible for inhumane conduct on the part of his subordinates and ought to be scheduled for prosecution.Attention is specially directed to. the fact that this Report does not refer at all to the Western Front. A preliminary report relating to the Western Front will be found at p. 75 of the Interim Reports, and a further report iis in course of preparation.Finally, the Sub-Committee regrets that attempts to effect com-municatipn with the French authorities which investigated offences against the laws of war proved ineffectual. In consider-ing doubtful cases, or cases in, which there was a deficiency of evidence, much mutual assistance might. haye been rendered.&apos;4 February, 1920,A, F. Peterson.

III.General von Hanisch.General von Hanisch was the G.O.C. 10th Army Corps (Hanover) District. He was detested by the British officers, prisoners of war, and apparently was regarded with no favour by his own men, who referred to him as the &quot; Pig of Hanover.&quot; He is said to have lost his command on the Western Front when he was opposed to British troops and to have nourished a rancorous feeling against the men who had caused his discomfiture; but if the account of his performances at Clausthal is correct, the expression of his emotions at the sight of French and Italian prisoners was equally unrestrained. He is a man of violent temper, addicted to fits of ungovernable fury, which caused some British officers who witnessed his ebullitions to doubt the measure of his sanity. This is probably the impression produced on men, who have been accustomed to self-restraint and courtesy on the part of their commanding officers, by the total absence of both in a Prussian officer of the type of General von Hanisch. In his command were the five camps of Holzminden, Clausthal, Strohen, Hesepe and Schwarmstedt, in which British officers were con-fined. At Clausthal, where there appear also to have been some Belgians, French and Italians, he inspected the prisoners of war, and, after making an observation of a disagreeable character about the Belgians, he stopped in front of the French prisoners of war and said in a loud tone to the Commandant: &quot; The French are our enemies; remember to treat them as such.&quot; Of the Italians he said: &quot;These are our would-be allies; do not forget that.&quot; When he reached the British officers he inquired whether any of them understood German, and then said slowly and deliberately in German : &quot; I hope to receive orders to send these officers behind the lines, as the English are employing our prisoners of Avar in the fire zone.&quot; At Clausthal he reduced the number of cinema per-formances, with the observation: &quot; German soldiers at the front do not have entertainments twice a week; twice a month is quite enough for prisoners.&quot; On his visit to Holzminden the senior British officer complained that there was a great delay in deliver-ing letters. His reply was : &quot; The British are all barbarians and do not deserve to be allowed to live, let alone receive letters.&quot; He then exploded on the subject of the &quot; Baralong,&quot; and asserted that British officers habitually broke their parole.It was observed that the day after his visit to Clausthal heating was stopped in all rooms except the dining room.After his unseemly behaviour at these two camps, it is not sur-prising that his name became a by-word among the British officers in his command, and that they ascribed to General von Hanisch all the vexatious treatment to which they were subjected. Most of the officers consider that he was the source of all the trouble. Having regard to his discreditable conduct at Holz-minden and Clausthal, to which reference has been made, he may
well nave ueen directly responsible for much, and certainly a subordinate, who heard him give orders not to forget to treat French, Italian, or British prisoners as enemies, would not be encouraged to treat them with lenience or consideration.   But the evidence connecting him with much of the vexatious conduct of which complaint is made is extremely scanty.   It is suggested that he chose Puttensen, the two Niemeyers the twin pre-war pork butchers of Buffalo, ILS.A. and the two Commandants of Strohen Camp as fit instruments of his desire to inflict as much discomfort as possible on the prisoners.   But it is only right to remember, on the other hand, that the Commandants and officers at Schwarmstedt and Hesepe Camps were courteous and con-siderate gentlemen.   There is also some difference of opinion among the officers as to the person who was really the cause of the vexatious restrictions which were imposed.   Most of them accuse General von Hanisch, but one at least says that the real culprit was General von Broesing who had an English mother and wanted to prove that he was a &quot;good German&quot; and that &quot; General von Hanisch was probably too much occupied to devise the petty annoyances to which we were Subjected.&quot;   That the Hanover Command was responsible for many, if not most, of the restrictions and discomforts to which the prisoners were subjected (e.g., the refusal to allow fuel for the warming of more than the dining room at Clausthal) is fairly clear; but it is impossible to apportion the blame between General Pavlowski (the Inspector General),  General von Broesing and  General von  Hanisch. General von Hanisch, however, has only his violent temper and impossible behaviour to blame if most of the prisoners believe that, as the Chief of the Hanover Command, he gave rein to his animosity and actively encouraged, if he did not himself direct, the system of harassing and vexatious treatment which disgraced the administration of such camps at Holzminden, Clausthal and Strohen.   But, assuming that General von Hanisch is personally responsible for the harassing conditions of the camps, the question is whether there is any ground on which he can be brought to trial.   There is ample evidence that the system caused intense irritation and much discomfort; but there is no evidence that it injuriously affected the health of any officer.   In this respect this case differs from the flagrant cases of inhumanity which harp occurred in connection with some of the camps and working camps in which N.C.O.&apos;s and privates have been confined.   It is not thought that the treatment of the officer prisoners of war in the camps in General von Hanisch&apos;s command can properly be described as inhumane within the meaning of The Hague Conven-tion of 1907; while it is deserving of severe reprehension, it hardly comes within the class of war-crimes.   Nor is it easy to see what punishment a Court Martial under military law in this country could inflict upon General von Hanisch for his misconduct.   The test appears to be what would be the sentence on a British officer who was convicted of a similar offence by a British Court Martial. If, as seems probable, the sentence would be dismissal from the
Service, such a punishment could obviously have no application ic the case of an officer in the German Army. The Sub-Committee has therefore been unable to do more than record its opinion that General von Hanisch is a man of violent temper and- poor intelli-gence, destitute of generous feeling and totally unfit to be placed in control of prisoners of war.IV.Execution op Miss Edith Cavell.This case has been anxiously considered by the Sub-Committee on many occasions, and every endeavour has been made to obtain full information as to the charge on which Miss Cavell was con-victed, the evidence in support of the charge, the conduct of the trial and the relevant provisions of the German Law. Recently the Sub-Committee has received from the Foreign Office a copy of the German Official Record of the proceedings, supplied by.the German Government.The question which the Sub-Committee has to determine is whether, on the material before it, any person concerned in the trial or execution of Miss Cavell has been guilty of a war-crime; and this question resolves itself into the further questions (a) whether the Court Martial which condemned Miss Cavell to death had jurisdiction to do so and (6) whether there is any evidence which shows that the members of that tribunal sentenced her to death knowing that the evidence was not suffi-cient to support the charge made against her, or that the charge was one which under German Law did not involve the penalty of death. It would not be sufficient to contend that in some other countries, or even in Germany, a lighter sentence would or might have been inflicted; for, if the tribunal had, under the German Law which it was administering, power to impose either a sentence of death or a sentence of less severity, it would be impossible to arraign its members for a crime because they came to the conclu-sion that it was a case in which they ought to impose the severest sentence which they had jurisdiction to inflict.Miss Cavell was principal of the Berkendael Medical Institu-tion 1149, Rue de la Culture, Brussels. From November, .1914, to July, 1915, she received into her house and fed a number of men of English, French and Belgian nationality who were sent to her by various persons, most of whom were tried with her. Some of these men were British or French soldiers who had been separated from the British or French armies and left behind during the rapid advance of the German forces to the Marne in .1914. Others were Frenchmen or Belgians who were desirous of escaping from Belgium or the occupied portions of France in order to join the French or Belgian armies. Miss Cavell was sup-plied with money by some of the persons who sent the men to her,
and also provided money out of her own funds, for the purpose of facilitating the passage of the British, French and Belgian men who desired to escape from Belgium. False papers of identity were concocted; and, as appears from Miss Cavell&apos;s evidence, she knew that this was being done. The men were then entrusted to certain guides, whose duty it was to conduct them over the fron-tier into Holland. Miss Cavell knew that she was doing that which exposed her to the risk of punishment; for in April, 1915, she told Dame Adelaide Livingstone that she had for a long time past been engaged with other persons in sending men into Hol-land, and when asked whether she realised that she was risking her life she replied that she was risking imprisonment but not her life.Miss Cavell was arrested in the early part of August, 19.15 (Mr. Beck, in &quot; The Case of Edith Cavell,&quot; p. 29, gives the date as the 5th August). After undergoing preliminary examination, she, with 34 other men and women, was tried on the 7th and 8th October, 1915 (see German Official Record of the proceedings and M. Sadi Kirschen, who was counsel for Miss Cavell at the trial, in &quot; Devant les Conseils de Guerre Allemands, pp. 55 and 80). On the 9th October the members of the tribunal deliberated and con-demned Miss Cavell and five others (MM. Baucq, Libiez and Severin, the Comtesse de Belleville and Mile Thuliez) to death (see German Official Record and Proclamation of 12th October; M. Kirschen&apos;s book says four others, p. 95). Dr. Stoeber, who conducted the prosecution, had apparently pressed for sentence of death in nine cases (see M. Kirschen&apos;s book, p. 53). Sentences of imprisonment varying in severity were passed on 21 others of the accused (see Proclamation, .12th October). On the 11th October the sentences were read to the prisoners (M. Kirschen&apos;s book, p. 93). In the interval between the 9th and the 11th October the sentences were confirmed by the Military Governor, von Sauberzweig (M. Ivirschen&apos;s book, pp. 101 and 102). Miss Cavell and M. Baucq were shot on the night of .11th October, 1915 (M. Kirschen&apos;s book, p. 105). The German authorities issued placards announcing the fact (see Proclamation). The sentence of death on the Comtesse de Belleville, Mile Thuliez, M. Severin and M. Libiez was commuted in consequence, probably, of the indignation excited by the execution of Miss Cavell.The Court. Miss Cavell was tried by a &quot; Feldgericht&quot; (Field Court Martial), under Sect. 6 of the Imperial Decree of the 28th December, 1899, &apos;&apos; respecting extraordinary Court Martial Pro-ceedings against Foreigners &quot; (see German Official Record). The same Record shows that the Court was appointed by the German Governor of Brussels.The Charge against her was that she was guilty of &quot; Zufuhrung von Mannschaften an dem Feinde &quot; (see German Official Record). It has been suggested that these German words mean guiding, conducting, or leading men to the enemy, and that the offence is not committed unless the accused has himself accompanied the
men and with them reached the enemy. &quot;Zufuhrung*&apos; un-doubtedly means &quot; leading or conducting to &quot;; but a reference to FliigePs German Dictionary shows that it also has the meaning of &quot;supplying.&quot; It is obvious that the Feldgericht, which presumably understood the German language as well as its foreign critics, interpreted the word in this way, and the French trans-lation of the words in M. Kirschen&apos;s book (p. 43) is &quot; fournit a l&apos;ennemi des homines.&quot; It seems clear that the charge against Miss Cavell was that of &quot; furnishing or supplying men to the enemy.&quot;The Law. The above-mentioned Decree of the 28th December, 1899, provides for &quot;extraordinary Court-martial Proceedings &quot; against Foreigners.&quot; If the competent authorities direct such proceedings (see Section 4), the tribunal is a Feldgericht (Sec-tion 6). Such proceedings are by Section 3 authorised in the case of the offences mentioned in Section 2. By Section 2 it is pro-vided that on entering an enemy country the Army Commanders are to issue proclamations to the inhabitants expressly stating that all persons who do not belong to the enemy forces, including civil officials of the enemy Government, incur the penalty of death &quot;if they undertake to render assistance to a hostile power or cause detriment to the German or allied forces&quot; (wenn sie es unternehmen der feindlichen Macht Vorschub zu leisten oder den Deutschen oder verbundeten truppen Nachteil zuzufugen). Under this Decree the Feldgericht is empowered to try prisoners who render assistance to a hostile power or cause detriment to the German or allied forces. These words are taken from Section 58 of the German Military Penal Code, which, trans-lated, runs thus: &quot;the penalty of death is incurred for war treason (Section 57) by any person who, with the intention of &apos; rendering assistance to a hostile power or of causing detriment to the German or allied forces, (a) commits one of the offences speci-fied in Section 90 of the German Penal Code.&quot; One of the offences mentioned in Section 90 of the German Penal Code is (3)&apos; supplying men to the enemy (Zufiihrung von Mannschaften an dem Feinde). It may be added that under Section 160 of the German Military Penal Code a foreigner who during war is guilty in the theatre of war of an offence provided for in (amongst others) Section 58 of that Code is punishable according to the provisions of that Section. It seems clear that under these Sections supplying men to the enemy is a method of rendering assistance to a hostile power or causing detriment to the German or allied forces, and that when the act is done with the intention of rendering such assistance or causing such detriment it is punishable with death. The result is that, under these provisions, if a non-German in Belgium was found guilty of supplying men to the enemy with the intention of assisting a hostile power or causing detriment to the German forces or their allies, a Feldgericht had jurisdiction to sentence him to death.&apos; But it was not obligatory to impose the death penalty, as Section 58 of the Military Penal Code&apos; pro-vides for sentence of hard labour &quot; in less serious cases.&quot;-
Evidence. The next question is: was the evidence before the Feldgericht such as might reasonably have satisfied the tribunal (a) that Miss Cavell supplied or furnished men to the enemy, and (b) that she did so with the intention of assisting the Allies or causing detriment to the German forces or their allies. The Feldgericht found that she had supplied men to the enemy, and in the &quot; Reasons for sentence&quot; there appears this statement: &quot; The object which the defendants pursued in the entire procedure was, in the opinion of the Court, to render assistance to the enemy forces and to cause detriment to our troops &quot; an obvious reference to Section 58 of the Military Penal Code and Section 2 of the Decree of the 28th December, 1899.After her arrest Miss Cavell was examined, before the actual trial, in the Continental manner on three occasions, the 8th, 18th and 22nd August, and her depositions appear in the German Official Record. These preliminary examinations seem to have been conducted by Lieut. Bergan, assisted by another German named Pinkhof (see M. Kirschen&apos;s book, p. 79). Miss Cavell spoke French fluently (see M. Kirschen&apos;e book, p; 60). The ques-tions which she was asked seem to have been put in French; the substance of her answers was taken down; and when her deposi-tion was complete, it appears from the German Record that it was on each occasion read over to her in French, and she then signed the deposition as correct (see Record, Reasons for sentence, and M. Kirschen&apos;s book, p. 79). As appears from the German Record, at the examination of the 8th August Miss Cavell stated that from November, 1914, to the beginning of July, 1915, she &quot; har-boured in her house, fed and provided with money in order to render possible their journey to the front and their joining the allied armies dispersed (&quot; versprengte&quot;) English and French soldiers in civilian clothing, including an English Colonel, and able-bodied Belgian and French men who desired to go to the Front&quot; ; that these men were brought to her by various persons; that she concealed them until a favourable opportunity offered itself for their departure; that she took most of the men herself to various places which she specified and handed them on to guides who were provided by certain persons (including M. Severin); that she provided the men with money out of funds (3,400 frs.) pro-vided by certain persons (including Severin), and 300 frs. pro-vided by herself and 200 frs. or 300 frs. collected by her &quot; for alleged benevolent purposes.&quot; She stated that the 3,400 frs. were given to her &quot; solely for the purpose of handing them to the soldiers and volunteers in order to render possible their journey to the front.&quot; She stated that between her and certain persons (including Severin) there existed &quot; agreements having for their object the supplying of men to the Armies of the Allies,&quot; and that she had heard from some six of the men whom she had sent on in this way that they had arrived in Holland. On the 18th August she stated that other English soldiers (20 in number) had been brought to her by another person &quot; to be conducted further im their journey,&quot; and that another brought her 40 British soldiers
30and two Belgian volunteers &quot; to be conducted over the frontier,&quot; while still another brought her 15 English soldiers &quot;to be taken on their way.&quot; She stated that another person &quot; assisted her in conveying men to the Allied army by giving her sums amounting to 500 frs. for the purpose of facilitating the further journey to the front of the soldiers and volunteers,&quot; and that she &quot; never made any common cause or had any dealings with this person in other matters than the conveying of men to the Allied army.&quot; On this occasion she also stated that she knew that the papers of identity carried by the soldiers and volunteers whom she assisted were false. On the 22nd August she stated that &quot; six or seven British soldiers in civilian costume and two or three Belgian volunteers who wished to go to the front &quot; were brought to her by another person who asked her to get them over the Belgian-Dutch frontier &quot; which I did.&quot; This is a summary of the depositions taken on Miss Cavell&apos;s preliminary examinations, as they appear in the German Record; and from these depositions it appears that she stated that she had sent men secretly across the frontier in order that they might join the Allied armies. The first day of the trial was the 7th October, 1915; and it appears from the German Record that she was again examined, this time by Dr. Stoeber (see M. Kirschen&apos;s book), and stated that she gave lodging to the British &quot; because they were in danger of their lives,&quot; and that through her instrumentality about 200 men had been guided to the frontier. This Record is borne out by M. Kirschen (see pp. 63 and 64 of his book), who states (p. 54) that the depositions were read on this day, and adds from notes which he made of Miss Cavell&apos;s evidence that she was asked this question: &quot; Erom December, 1914, to July, 1915, you lodged French and English soldiers, one a Colonel, all in civilian costume, you aided Bel-gians, Frenchmen and Englishmen who were fit for Military Ser-vice by supplying them with the means of reaching the front, and particularly by receiving them into your house and by giving them money?&quot; To this question Miss CavelPs answer was &quot;Yes.&quot; He also states that Miss Cavell affirmed the accuracy of what she had said in her depositions as to her collaboration with others &quot; en vue du recrutement.&quot; He adds that Miss Cavell was asked by Dr. Stoeber this question: &quot; Savez-vous qu&apos;en recrutant ainsi des homines vous desavantagiez les Allemands et avantagiez 1&apos;ennemi?&quot; and that she replied: &quot;Ma preoccupation n&apos;a pas ete d&apos;avantager 1&apos;ennemi, mais de faire gagner la Frontiere aux homines qu&apos;on m&apos;addressait; une fois h la Frontiere, ils etaient libres.&quot;On these admissions it seems impossible to say that the Court-martial was not justified in coming to the conclusion that Miss Cavell supplied men to the enemy, intending to assist the hostile power. She repeatedly said that she acted as she did to enable the men to join the Allied armies; and, assuming that M. Kirschen&apos;s note of the evidence at the trial is correct, the last answer quoted is not necessarily inconsistent with her other answers, aB it seems to amount to a statement that her main motive
was not to assist the Allies. But even if this were not so, it is impossible to say that the Court was bound to accept this last statement and disregard all the admissions which Miss Cavell had already made.The tribunal found her guilty of &quot; completed war treason effected by supplying men to the enemy.&quot; (The F.O. translation of the German Record gives &quot; consummate &quot; as the rendering of &quot; vollendet,&quot; but the word means &quot;completed.&quot; This transla-tion also in this case renders&apos; &quot; Zufiihrung &quot; by the word &quot; con-ducting,&quot; though in the first page of the translation the same word is rendered &quot; sending.&quot;) It has been suggested that there was no evidence on wThich the tribunal could come to the decision that any of the men sent forward by Miss Cavell reached England or France or their respective armies that there is only evidence (on her admission) that some of the men reached Holland. But it would be impossible to say that the Court-martial acted with impropriety in drawing the inference that men who.were desirous of joining the Allied armies and reached Holland were successful in reaching England or France or their armies, especially when admittedly that was at least one of the objects in sending them to Holland. Moreover, M. Severin, who was one of those who brought men to Miss Cavell for the purpose of having them smuggled out of Belgium in order that they might join the Allied armies, stated that he had received and cared for six or seven English soldiers, four French soldiers and 20 to 25 French and Belgian volunteers who wanted to go to the front, that they were led to the frontier partly by his guide and partly by &quot; Miss CavelFs guide,&quot; and that a number of the men had acquainted him of their safe arrival in Holland &quot; and even in France.&quot;From these considerations it follows that the Feldgericht was justified in finding that Miss Cavell had committed the offence with which she was charged, and that it had power under the German law which it was administering to condemn her to death.Oilier suggested objections to the proceedings.(a) Counsel. Under Section 9 of the Decree, &quot; in respect of extraordinary Court-martial proceedings against Foreigners,&quot; the accused is entitled to defend himself personally or by another before the Feldgericht; and if the charge involves the penalty of death it is obligatory to appoint an advocate to defend the prisoner. It appears from M. Kirschen&apos;s book (p. 54) that very soon after Miss CavelFs arrest M. Thomas Braun was invited to undertake her defence. M. Braun is a Belgian advocate, and, it is understood, a son of the Belgian Senator, M. Alexandre Brann, also an advocate, who was counsel for the Princesse Marie de Croye at the trial. It appears from an incident at another trial described,on p. 19 of M. Kirschen&apos;s book that M. T. Braun was certainly not animated by pro-German feeling. In consequence of this incident he was prohibited by the German authorities from appealing before any Court-martial (M. Kerschen, p. 19), and
consequently was unable to represent Miss Cavell at the trial. On the 7th September, 1915, M. T. Braun and M. Eug. Hanssens (another Belgian advocate) appear to have asked M. Sadi Kirschen to act as Miss CavelVs counsel (M. Kirschen&apos;s book, p. 54). He seems to have written to Miss Cavell asking whether she accepted his assistance, and received no answer, possibly, as suggested, because the German police intercepted bis letter (M. Kirschen&apos;s book, p. 54). He did, in fact, however, act as her counsel at the trial. Mr. Beck, in his book, suggests that, though M. Kirschen was a naturalised Belgian, he was a German by birth; but M. Kirschen&apos;s account of himself (see his book, p. 502) is that he was born at Jassy, in Roumania, and that he is of Roumanian descent.(b) Counsel for Miss Cavell does not seem to have been present at her preliminary examinations. M. Kirschen obviously could not have done so, as he was not invited to take up the case until after these examinations were at an end. There is no positive evidence on the question whether M. Thomas Braun was permitted to be present; but as Section 9 of the Decree above referred to provides for representation by counsel before the Feldgericht, it would seem that counsel is not allowed to attend at the preliminary examinations. This appears to be confirmed by M. Kirschen when he says (p. 35 of his book) that the rule was that counsel did not see his client &quot; avant l&apos;audience,&quot; and under Section 337 of the &quot;Military Criminal Courts Regulations&quot; of the 1st December, 1898, the accused is entitled to the assistance of counsel after the preliminary examination has been closed. From the English point of view, which insists upon the im-portance of the prisoner having such legal assistance as he may desire at all stages, this deprivation of the prisoner of assistance at what may be, and in this case was, the most critical part of the proceedings may appear to be an infringement of the rule of fair play. But it must be remembered that the Continental system of procedure does not provide for examination, cross-examination and re-examination by counsel; and in any case the objection is one against the system and not against those whose duty it is to administer the existing system.(c) M. Kirschen states (p. 55 of his book) that he did not see the depositions before the 7th October when they were read out in court (p. 54); but he seems to have ascertained before that date what was the nature of the charge (p. 54). He says (p. 55) that he has not any legal ground of complaint on this ground, &quot; c&apos;etait la regie.&quot; It is not clear that this is the correct view; for under Section 344 of the &quot; Military Criminal Courts Regula-tions&quot; (1st December, 1898) the depositions must be shown to the prisoner^ counsel after the close of the preliminary examina-tion on demand (auf verlangen). There is nothing to show that M. Kirschen ever made this request. Indeed his observation as to &quot;the rule&quot; seems to indicate that he was not aware that he was entitled to inspect the depositions.   If M. Kirschen was
entitled on request to see the depositions and did not ask to see them, it cannot be said that the tribunal was to blame because he did not avail himself of his rights; although perhaps a more sympathetic and less technically correct man than Dr. Stoeber would have taken care that this provision of the German law should be drawn to the attention of Belgian advocates who were defending prisoners accused of a capital offence. If on the other hand there is a prohibition against the disclosure of the deposi-tions before the trial, while it is legitimate to condemn it in un-sparing terms, the complaint is against the system and not against those who administer the system. It may be doubted whether, having regard to the admissions contained in the depositions, the inspection of them by M. Kirschen would have had any influence on the result of the trial. It is well also for those who are not experts in the German procedure in Courts-martial to bear in mind that Dr. Stoeber, who had the conduct of the case, is described by M. Kirschen as a man who was thoroughly conversant with the law which governed such cases.(d) M. Kirschen did not see Miss Cavell before the trial on the 7th October. Here again (p. 55 of his book) he says that this was in accordance with the rule. But it is to be observed that Section 345 of the &quot;Military Criminal Courts Regulations&quot; of the 1st December, 1898, provides that an accused person who has been arrested is permitted access to his advocate by written or oral communication subject to some restrictions as to the use of this privilege. The Sub-Committee is not in a position to say positively whether this regulation does or does not apply to pro-ceedings before a Feldgericht. Possibly the provision in Section 9 of the Decree of 1899 that the accused is entitled to defend himself by another before the Feldgericht was considered as pre-cluding the assistance of counsel before the trial. If Section 345 applies, M. Kirschen, and presumably the other Belgian advocates-cates who acted for the other prisoners, seem not to have been aware of it, and did not avail themselves of it. If it did not apply and there was a prohibition in the German law against communication between counsel and client in the case of proceed-ings before a Feldgericht, the law might be open to severe condemnation, but it could not be said that those w7ho administered the law were guilty of a war crime.(e) Apparently, at the trial, M. Kirschen was forbidden by Dr. Stoeber to speak to Miss Cavell (see his book, pp. 55 and 92). It is not known on what legal grounds this prohibition was based. If the Section referred to in (d) was applicable the prohibition would seem to have been contrary to the German Law. If it was not, and under German Law the prisoner and his Counsel are prohibited from communicating with one another during the trial at a Feldgericht, the Sub-Committee thinks that such a prohibition is utterly to be condemned, as it deprives the advocate of the assistance of the client and deprives the client of the advantage of consulting and being advised by his Counsel; but, if there is such a prohibition, the fault lies with the German Law
mand not with the tribunal which has to administer it. If Dr. Stoeber, contrary to the provisions of German Law, prohibited M. Eirschen from communicating with Miss Cavell at the trial, he deserves the severest reprobation; but there can be little doubt that, even if communication had been permitted, it would not have influenced the decision of the tribunal.(/) It has been suggested that there was no interpreter employed in the proceedings, although this was required by Section 116 of the Military Criminal Courts Regulations, 1st December, 1898. But it is plain from several paragraphs of M. Kirschen&apos;s book (see pp. 78, 81 and 90, where the interpreter is represented as putting a question to Miss Cavell) that there was an interpreter at the trial. As to the depositions, Miss Cavell was examined in French (see German Official Record), as she understood that tongue, and this implies either that the German who asked the questions knew French or that there was an interpreter. If the examiner understood French, no interpreter was required (see Section 116). According to Section 116 evidence given in a foreign language is, &quot;so far as the importance of the matters requires,&quot; to be recorded in that foreign language as well as in German. Assuming that this Regulation applies to proceedings before a Feldgericht and to the preliminary examination, it is not clear on the material before the Committee that the evidence was not in this case taken down both in French and German. From the &quot; reasons for sentence &quot; in the official record it appears that it was proved to the satisfaction of the Court (by Lieut. Bergan, see M. Kirschen&apos;s book, p. 79) that &quot;the depositions were drawn up with punctilious scrupulousness, translated accurately-and then only signed after having been read over and approved.&quot; This would seem to indicate that the depositions were drawn up in one tongue, then translated into another, then read over and ultimately signed. At the foot of the first deposition appears this statement (signed by Miss Cavell): &quot; My statements just read over to me in French translation correspond in all points to the truth.&quot; This also is consistent with the contention that there was a French rendering which was read to Miss Cavell before she signed. On this evidence it is impossible to say that there was a breach of the provisions of Section 116. But if there was, it was at worst an irregularity; for, as has already been pointed out, Miss Cavell, according to M. Kirschen&apos;s account, at the trial admitted that she had aided men to reach the front (i.e., the Allies), and there is no ground for believing that the depositions are not substantially accurate.(g) It has also been suggested that, owing to the breach of the treaty of neutrality, the very presence of the German forces in Belgium was unlawful, and all the acts of the tribunals which they set up in Belgium were vitiated by this illegality. This contention appears to lead to unpractical conclusions; but it is perhaps unnecessary to pursue it further in this connection. Whatever may be the liability of the persons who were respon-sible for the invasion of Belgium, it seems impossible to say that
the tribunal which tried Miss Cavell, or the persons who carried out its sentence, were guilty of a war-crime for which they can be prosecuted before an International Tribunal on the ground that, though they acted in accordance with the provisions of German Military Law, the law itself ought not to have been enforced, because Belgium ought not to have been invaded. This appears to be a contention which would not have any prospect of success.Having regard to the above observations, the Sub-Committee is of opinion that there is no prospect that a prosecution of any of the persons concerned in the trial of Miss Cavell would result in a conviction, and accordingly it does not recommend a prose-cution.The Execution of Miss Cavell.Miss Cavell and M. Baucq were executed on the night following the reading of the sentence to the prisoners (11th October). The others who were condemned to death were not executed and were subsequently reprieved. Why these two were selected for immediate execution is not very clear. But it is plain that the American Legation at Brussels had been, and was then, actively engaged in endavouring to obtain, information as to Miss CavelPs case, and that when, after much difficulty, it was ascertained that she had been condemned to death it pressed for reconsideration and postponement of execution. The Military Governor (von Sauberzweig) apparently refused to reconsider the matter or to postpone execution, and it cannot be a matter of surprise that the belief should prevail that the execution of Miss Cavell was carried out with the utmost despatch in order to prevent the possibility of a successful appeal by the American Minister to a higher authority than von Sauberzweig. M. Baucq had apparently been actively engaged in the distribution of &quot; Le Libre Beige,&quot; and this may have been the reason why it was determined to dispose of him without delay after he had been condemned to death at the trial.It has been suggested that the rapidity with which execution followed sentence deprived Miss Cavell of any opportunity of appeal. But in cases of judgments &quot; im Felde,&quot; which, it is understood, include sentences by a &apos;&apos; Eeldgericht,&quot; there is no right of appeal (Section 419 of the Military Criminal Courts Regulations, 1st December, 1898).The account of the secrecy and chicanery of the German authorities in Brussels in connection with the American attempt to assist Miss Cavell, which is summarised in the White Paper (1915 [Cd. 8013]) and in Mr. Beefs book, leaves a very un-pleasant and unfavourable impression on the mind. But the Sub-Committee does not see its way to recommend the prosecution of von Sauberzweig. He had the power to confirm or to annul the sentence, and he confirmed it. He was not bound to postpone execution in order that representations might be made in other quarters.
305FOURTH INTERIM REPORT. THE WESTERN FRONT.The story of the treatment of the British prisoners on the Western Front has been so fully set out in the First Interim Report of the Sub-Committee (pp. 75-84) and in the reports of the Government Committee, Misc. 7 (1918), Misc. 19 (1918) and Misc. 27 (1918), that it is not necessary to repeat it in detail again. The object of this report is to attempt to direct attention to the salient points and to indicate the persons in the higher positions responsible for the state of affairs. *Since the First Interim Report was made all the statements of the returned prisoners have been sorted and arranged, and, in addition, a large body of most valuable medical evidence has become available. The general effect of this is set out below, together with a list of the medical officers whose evidence can establish the terrible condition to which our men were reduced.Further, there have reached the Sub-Committee certain notices and leaflets issued by the authorities on the lines of communication at Mons, which threaten severe punishments against civilians who gave, and against prisoners who received, any food.The Sub-Committee suggests that careful enquiry should be made in the occupied districts with a view to discovering further orders of a like nature issued by the German authorities either at Mons or elsewhere.The evidence before the Sub-Committee, covers the period from early in 1917 to the date of the Armistice, but it is clear that the woi*st treatment was during the period from the end of March to November, 19.18 worst in the sense that it was more widespread, indeed, almost universal. While the personal ill-treatment was throughout much the same, it is evident that as the fighting power of the enemy declined and his prospects became less bright, so was there less regard for the rules of international law and the dictates of humanity. Prisoners were kept close behind the front line for longer periods; their food and accommo-dation were worse, and they were worked until they were incapable of doing another hour&apos;s work. There is, indeed, evidence that the German medical men were shocked at the state to which the prisoners were reduced, and at Flavy-le-Martel they expressed their views in no measured terms.In these circumstances the Sub-Committee has thought it best not to attempt to discover the name of every officer in command at each place during a part of the period, but to indicate the Army Commanders in the different districts or other officers of high rank, who must bear the responsibility for the dreadful conditions which existed. -With this object in view the Sub-Committee approached the War Office, which has been good enough to prepare a map show-ing approximately the area in which, in June, 1918, the different German Armies were operating, and has, as far as its information
extends, grouped the places mentioned in this report in the districts of the different armies. It should, however, be mentioned that the Sub-Committee has no evidence beyond the statement of the War Office that the Generals mentioned were in command of these districts, nor any direct evidence that they were responsible for the prisoners, and that with regard to places on the border lines of different army districts there cannot be any certainty as to the General actually in command.Army Areas.The German forces in France in June, 1918, were in four groups, under the Crown Prince Eupprecht of Bavaria, the Crown Prince of Germany, General von Gallwitz, and Duke Albrecht of Wiirtemberg&apos; respectively. Comprised in these groups were 13 armies commanded by the Generals hereafter named, and, starting from the north, they followed southwards in the order mentioned below :  -(1) The fourth army commanded by General Sixt von Arnim; (2) the sixth by General von Quast; (3) the seventeenth by General Otto von Below; (4) the second by General von der Marwitz; (5) the eighteenth by General von Hutier; (6) the seventh by General von Boehm; (7) the first by General Fritz von Below; (8) the third by General von Einem; (9) the fifth by General von Francois; (10) C Detachment by General Fuchs; (11) the nineteenth by General von Bothmer; (12) A Detach-ment by General von Mudra; and (13) B Detachment by General von Gun dell.The areas of these commands are shown approximately on the map supplied by the War Office to the Sub-Committee,The British prisoners were almost entirely in the areas of the first seven armies, which were opposite to the main British armies.Grounds of Complaint.A perusal of the White Papers and of the previous reports of the Sub-Committee will show that the grounds of complaint are as follows:  1. Very bad accommodation and sanitation.2. Underfeeding and overwork.3. Compelling prisoners to do work of a military nature, 4. Exposure to Allied shell fire. 5. General brutality. The facts with regard to each of these subjects are dealt with in relation to each army area.The Sub-Committee has come to the conclusion that much space would be occupied, and little advantage would be gained, by setting out in respect to each place the names and regiments of the witnesses, who numbered 2,289. When the time comes for preparing the proofs of the evidence to be placed before the tribunal appointed to try the offenders, the names and addresses of possible witnesses can be found without difficulty in the files and card indexes which have been prepared for the Sub-Cbm-mittee.   In this report, therefore, an indication is given only of
the number of witnesses whose evidence has been examined with regard to each place mentioned; it will be easy in most cases to supplement this evidence, if necessary.The number of places with regard to which statements have been made exceeds 300, but in each army area only those places are here mentioned where, either there is a considerable body ot evidence, or the conditions appear to have been exceptionally bad, even for the Western front, with regard to one.or more of the matters above indicated. A list has been prepared with regard to each place other than those herein mentioned containing a very short precis of the evidence which can be given by the soldiers named.Fourth Army : General von Arnim.The front of this army extended from the coast to the neigh-bourhood of Armentieres, and the places especially complained of are : Fournies and Dupres (9).* Ghent (7).Honthem (2 and a number of men of the Irish Rifles andEing&apos;s Liverpool Regiment). Renaix (20 and some Belgians). Termonde (or-Dendermonde) (29). Le Quesnoy (39)1. Accommodation and Sanitation.The accommodation in this army district was with one excep-tion not so bad as in most of the other districts.   At Ghent the men were lodged in an underground magazine which at all events gave shelter.   At Renaix they lived in some artillery barracks, but the sanitation was disgraceful.   The latrines were bad.   In  some of the rooms  150 men were locked in at night, and the conditions were indescribable.   At Le Quesnoy the conditions were very bad  indeed, and this  was  the more inexcusable, as throughout 1917 and 1918 Le Quesnoy appears   to  have been a standing camp where   prisoners were sent and then distributed to other places.    The accom-modation provided in 1918 consisted of a few ruinous cot-tagesj  which are said to have been capable of providing adequate shelter for not more than 400 men.   The number there varied from 1,400 to 2,000.   The cottages were within a barbed wire enclosure. . Many men had to sleep in the open, some with-out blankets.   The latrines were entirely insufficient in number, and there was sometimes a scramble for a seat there at night in order that exhausted men might sit down  for a few minutes&apos; rest.    Dysentery was rife, and sick men who had managed to secure shelter, such as it was, in one of the cottages, were often obliged to relieve themselves on the floor.    The drinking water was bad, being obtained from a well close to the* The number opposite each place is the number of persons whose statements have been examined.
latrines, which were nothing more than trenches dug in tho ground.2. Underfeeding and Overwork.In this Army District as in all others the evidence relating to insufficient food is overwhelming.At Ghent complaints about the insufficiency of food led to much ill-treatment. At Honthem the men are said to have had fits induced by starvation. At Renaix the food was especially bad and insufficient, and there is evidence available both from prisoners and Belgians that Belgians who, seeing the deplorable condition of the men, gave or endeavoured to give them food, were severely punished.It may be convenient to deal here once and for all with the possible defence which might be set up in answer to the charge based on the insufficiency of the food and the refusal to allow the Belgians or French to succour the prisoners.   The Germans may say that owing to the blockade they had no food to give them; but there is ample evidence to show that in nearly all, if not all, places the German soldiers were adequately fed.   But even if some such point could he made, the answer is that it was criminal to keep men at heaVy work on insufficient food, work which, as will be seen later from the medical and other evidence referred to, was enforced until the men collapsed,   Moreover, if the Germans were in such straits they had still less justification for preventing the inhabitants of the districts from doing what they could to supply deficiencies.   Lastly, reference may be/made to the undeniable fact that pel-sons have been punished in this country for giving food to prisoners.  That is true, but the con-ditions were different.   The German prisoners here were not starving, overworked and dying with dysentery; and though it may be necessary as a matter of discipline to prevent the supply of food and other things to prisoners, the plea of discipline cannot be allowed to override the claims of humanity when men are in the deplorable condition in which were the prisoners on the Western Front.At Termonde the prisoners did not work before October, 1918. but the food given was quite insufficient to keep the men in reasonable health even in those circumstances. The bread allow-ance here was only 2 lbs. for 7 men, or between 4f and 5 ozs. a day.At Le Quesnoy the bread allowance was considerably higher, 400 grammes* a day, but with the thin soup and acorn coffee made an entirely insufficient diet for men working hard. One witness says that 14 men died in 4 days from starvation.3. Compulsory work of a Military Nature.This Army District, which included a part of Belgium where little fighting was going on, does not afford many cases of workOne pound avoirdupois equals 453 grammes.
of this nature. At only three places, Fournies, Depres and Honthem, has the Sub-Committee been informed that prisoners were actually close behind the front line. There is evidence, however, that here men were forced to carry ammunition to the guns in action and hand grenades up to the front line trenches and they were made to work in the second line trenches and on the railway dumps.At Renaix two parties were told off to work on the shell dumps and similar labour was enacted at Le Quesnoy.4. Exposure to Shell-fire.At Honthem and Depres men were exposed to shell-fire-, gas and aeroplane bombs. They were deprived of their gas masks. Many were killed and wounded.5. General Brutality.From all the places come similar complaints of the brutality of the men in charge of the camps, the Feldwebels, Unteroffiziers and Gefreiters. At Ghent the men were beaten with rifles because they could not do their full work. One man was bayonetted for making a complaint, and ill-treatment followed complaints about food. There is a similar&apos;account of the treat-ment at Honthem, where one man complains that having fallen down with a block of concrete on his back he was Heft for a quarter of an hour and his fellow prisoners were not allowed to help him.But from Le Quesnoy comes the worst account. The Feld-webel in charge (name not known) is described as a &quot; perfect devil.&quot; Men taken to the bath and fumigating place were lashed with a whip when naked, and a dog was trained to herd the men into a corner and many were bitten. There was no medical attention at all at the camp. Men were sent to the hospital only when very ill indeed, and there is a terrible story told of the bodies of men who had died in the camp being sent off in a cart with ill and dying men lying on top of them. The mortality was very heavy, a fact which is supported by the statement of Sister St. John who was nursing in one of the hospitals.-Sixth Army : General von Quast.The front of the Sixth Army reached from somewhere near Armentieres to a point just E. of Lens. The places specially complained of are:  Bac St. Maur (11).Englos (Fort) or Pierquim (13).Flers (2).Flines (Fort) (8).Hallium (20).Raines (13).Hollain (12).Lessines (6).
Lawntie (16). Lomme (18). Loos (11).Lille (269) and Fort Macdonald (39).Maulde Montagne (28).Marquillies (20).Orchies (2.6 and several French).d&apos;origny (19).Phalempin (4).Tournai (60).Sautes (La Haie farm) (19).  afomg&apos; (24). (9).1. Accommodation and Sanitation.At none of the above places were both the accommodation and sanitation proper. The story of Lille and Fort Macdonald has been so. fully told in the previous report of the Subcommittee and in the White Papers that it is not here repeated. But the following places call for special remark. At Bac St. Maur 8 houses were crowded with British prisoners and 500 Portuguese. At first they were lodged in the church, sleeping on the stone floor without straw. &quot; At Hallium there was no covering for sleeping purposes, the place was filthy and there were noarrange-inents for washing, and 200 men were crowded into three small rooms. At Laventie there was no shelter at all till the men themselves made rough shelters, while Marquillies was not much better, there being but one hut with 25 wire beds, while from 250 to 400 prisoners were lodged in it. The place was filthy and verminous and there were no latrines or washing accommo-dation. At Maulde there were no latrines. The men were housed in a big factory at Orchies. It had a stone floor, was verminous and filthy; there were no washing arrangements, and the men were not provided with blankets though they had to sleep on the stone floor. There were no blankets or beds at d&apos;origny and for two months no water to wash in. Old farm buildings which had never been cleared out were used at La Haie farm, Sautes, and such bunks as there were were erected by the men.At Salome men were crowded into a church which had a stone floor. At first there were no blankets. There was no latrine and the prisoners had at night to evacuate in the church into which they were locked.At Tournai the prisoners were housed in the Cavalry Barracks which, except with regard to the larine accommodation, seems to have been adequate. There were, howver, only 4 seats in one latrine for 2,000 men, of whom many are said to have become ill in consequence of the filthy state of the latrines.The evidence relating to Tournai is interesting and valuable for two reasons. It is very full and detailed and gives an insight into the organisation of the prisoners of war behind the lines. Prisoners (in number 2,000) were sent from Germany and appear
to have been incorporated into the 69th Kriegsgefangenen Arbeit Hataillon. That portion of it which stopped at Tournai was called A.K.5 and was divided up into four companies, each ofIvhich was sent out to work in the neighbourhood or was moved is a Company to another camp. This question of organisation s more fully dealt with later.I. Underfeeding and Overwork.In this command, as elsewhere, the complaints as to the in-ufficiency of the food are very serious. There is not a single camp iom which there are not complaints of this nature, while from everal conies the statement that if men reported sick their rations vere cut down.At Loos three men are said to have died of starvation. At [faines many died of starvation and overwork; serious sickness iom these causes is reported from Phalempin and elsewhere, it Hollain, though the prisoners were starving, an.order was ead out that men receiving food from civilians would be severely Hinished; but at Tournai the prisoners seem to have depended or their evening meal on the kindness of the Belgians, and this without objection by the Germans.At Orchies the conditions in this respect seem to have been vovst of all. Over 100 men are said to have died of starvation. The condition to which the survivors were reduced is established jy a Court of Enquiry, composed of British Medical Officers, which sat at Bach ant to enquire into the cause of the state of three British soldiers, and reported that it was due to the treat-nent they had received and the lack of food.The work was always hard, sometimes excessive and often iangerous.At Fort Flines, which was a punishment camp, it is stated hat the prisoners had to begin work at 5 a,m. and often lid not finish till 10 p.m., as, on their return to the fort rom their regular work, they were told off to saw wood and other observation of that sort.From Fort Flines men had to march to work at Arras. They ose at 3 a.m., and got back at 8 p.m. The hours at Lomme were imilar. The men worked at Armentieres. At the end of June, 918 they had to rise soon after 3 a.m., and did not get back to illets till 7.30 or 8 p.m.At many places the work was continuous for the whole shift; or instance, at Sautes (La Haie farm) the men on the shift froma.m. to 2 p.m. had to carry heavy shells without a break for est or food.. Compulsory Work of a Military Nature.3 At eleven of the camps above-mentioned prisoners were com-t    elled, often by actual ill-treatment or by threats, to do worklosely connected with the operations of war. v     At Bac St. Maur, Flers, Hollain, Laventie, Lessines, Mar-uillies, Maulde, d&apos;origny and Sautes they were forced to work on
ammunition dumps or loading or unloading ammunition and military stores. From Tournai they were sent out to do this work. At Laventie they had to carry shells to the German guns in action.At Haines prisoners had to dig trenches and put up barbed wire. This was not done in the back areas, to which possibly objection might not be made, but, as will be seen below, they were actually under fire while doing this work.Salome was the worst place. There they were set to work on a shell dump which was apparently well known to the Allies, for it was eventually blown up.4. Exposure to Shell-fire.At Bac St. Maur prisoners were continually exposed to shell-fire, and a large party was killed by bombs. At Flers, Hollain, Haines, Laventie, Lomrne, Loos, Marquillies and Sautes (La Haie farm) they were frequently under fire; at several of these places they were also exposed to bombs and gas. There were many casualties, but the highest number was at Salome, where, as before stated, the men were locked into the church at night. One night an Allied shell dropped on the church, killing a number, variously stated from 12 to 30, and wounding many more. The wounded were left all night in the darkness, lying on the stone floor, without attention, and were not removed till the next day.5. General Brutality.At every camp the men were ill-treated, driven, often when they were ill, to work, which they were incapable of performing because of their weakness, beaten with sticks and whips, and kicked. It would be wearisome and, for the purposes of this report, useless to go through all the camps, but the following may be taken as instances of what has been said above.At Fort Flines no doctor attended. Wo one was allowed to go to hospital who could stagger to work. The TJnteroffizier in charge had a dog which he set on the prisoners, and exceptional brutality was meted out to those who ventured to attempt escape.Medical attention was refused at Lessines. Many men died without seeing a doctor at all.   In one week 6 men died.At Maulde Montague one man was beaten for asking to see tho doctor, and died. Another was found dead from starvation. A third died of overwork and starvation. The Unterofhzier had refused to let him see the doctor; the doctor, however, saw the man later, refused to take him into hospital, and the man died. Lt. Schulz was in charge of this company, and Lt. Schwartz-wald appears to have been in charge of the actual camp. The Hnteroffizier&apos;s name was Dekken.It is said that at d&apos;origny men who reported sick, but were marked fit for work, were put into a small cage for 24 hours without food or shelter, and the German officer in charge habitually used a whip on prisoners who were not working hard enough to please him.
The ill-treatment at Tournai was shown in a way which, if not rare, was unusual. The sentries seem to have carried whips and to have used them; this was not uncommon. Peculiar brutality was shown by the sergeant of the sick quarters, Schobert by name. He lashed, kicked and struck the patients or men attending there in the most brutal way. Major Romer, who commanded E.K. 5, was not often at the barracks, and may perhaps not have known what was going on, but Lt. Gallus, his second in command, was continually there. Complaints were formally made to him, but no redress was obtained. A Company No. 3 of the E.IL 5 seems to have been at Wez, where a feldwebel Ludwig, who had been brutal at Tournai, continued his ill-treat-ment of the prisoners, and one man is said to have been killed by being struck with a heavy iron ladle.Summary.This Army District, in which was probably situated the largest number of places where British prisoners were detained and worked behind the German lines, affords many examples of every kind of ill-treatment to which the prisoners were subject. The accommodation provided was frequently such as to be quite unfit for human beings. The food was entirely insufficient; there appears to be good reason for thinking that it frequently con-tained a number of calories barely sufficient for men lying in bed and doing no work whatever, yet upon such a diet men were often forced to do very heavy work exposed to gunfire, gas and bombs. The result was widespread disease, chiefly&apos; dysentery, from which men died in hundreds. Their treatment was brutal in the extreme. It comes as a relief almost as a shock to any-one reading the mass of evidence at the disposal of the Sub-Committee to find some officer mentioned who seems to have had some sense of humanity, or some sentry or guard who is said to have treated his charges with anything approaching kindness or consideration.The ill-treatment was not confined to the healthy and strong. It was meted out to the sick, the wounded and the suffering, and, as will be seen below, there is no escape from the conclusion that this was done deliberately and as a matter of policy.Seventeenth Army : General Otto von Below.The front of this army in June, 1918, extended from a point near Lens to close to Albert. The places with regard to which most evidence has been collected are:  Bapaume (33). Brebieres (11). Cambrai (2). Denain(2$).Douai (25 and French evidence). Ecoust (63). Emitters (11). Fresnes (18).
Guesnain (9). Hasmon (8). Locquinol (14).Marchiennes (37 and 8 French.).Marquion (67).Moeuvres (11).Prouvy (13).Qweani (48).Raisines (39).Armand (20). Sailly (8). Valenciennes (97). Villers le Cagnicourb (69).1. Accommodation and Sanitation.The accommodation throughout this command seems to have been specially bad, with the exception of Valenciennes, which is the one place on the Western Front where the balance of the evidence is in favour of the prisoners having beem treated like human beings and. with some consideration. This seems to have been largely due to a captain in charge of the local aerodrome, where most of the prisoners were employed;-At Eccust, Queant, Sailly and Tillers le Cagnicourt there was no shelter at all at first. At Queant, the billets seem always to have been open to the wind and rain, but at Sailly, after being for some time kept in the open, the prisoners were placed in dugouts, and eventually some huts were provided.At Marchiennesi prisoners had for some time to sleep in an old barge, which seems to have been very unhealthy, as 28 out of 50 had to go to hospital; at, another time they lived under sheli-shattered sheets of iron; at another they apparently had a roof over their beads but had to lie on the floor without blankets or straw.At Guesnain, in 1916-17, and at Hasmon, prisoners were put into damp cellars; at Douai they lived in an old brick kiln not more than 6 feet 6 inches high.At other places they were put in filthy and verminous barns, or as at Prouvy, in a factory, where they had to sleep on a cement and iron floor, without straw or blankets, or in a church. Where they were fortunate enough to get under a roof the prisoners were much overcrowded. At Fresnes, for instance, 380 men were squeezed into a place fit for 1O0. At Raisines there were 200 in a small room which was verminous. At Moeuvres 400 men were placed in a dugout or tunnel on the Canal du Nord in almost complete darkness. Whether because of this or for some other reason, it is said by C.S.M. T. T. Davis, 11th Essex, who bad charge of the records at headquarters at Cambrai, that 50 per cent, of the commando went sick in a few weeks, and the rest were sent to other commandos at Oagnicourt and Buissy.The sanitation was deplorable or non-existent.. There were nu latrines at all at Prouvy; at other places where the latrines were trenches they emitted pestilential smells.
2. Underfeeding and Overwork.Bad as the conditions were with regard to food and work in all the commands, the Seventeenth Army seems to have been the worst. Complaints come from all the nineteen camps mentioned above, while in the case of seventeen of them the complaints are very serious. At Denain men had to work 8 to 10 hours, with, a long walk to and from their place of labour. They received 213 grammes of bread; less than   lb. At Ecoust they worked from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., without a break, on starvation diet. From Ervillers comes the important statement that while the prisoners were starving the Germans had plenty. Thirty men died in hospital from starvation and overwork at Fresnes. At Tillers le Cagnicoairt the men had to walk 7 or 8 kilometres to their work, at which they were engaged from 6 a.m. to 2.30 p.m.: they then had some food, worked on till 6.30, and marched back to camp.It is unnecessary to go through all the camps, the above are typical, but mention must be made of Marchiennes, where the bread ration was l- of a loaf a day. (The size of the loaf is not mentioned, but it was usually between 500 and 600 grammes.) Here in February, -1918, 28 men were sent to hospital from weak-ness in 14 days. Ten of these died. The prisoners caught any-thing living fit to eat cats, dogs or rats. One man actually died in tie street on his way to the doctor, who said he died of starvation-tion. a story vouched by 4 French witnesses who tried to succour him.Tie Germans would allow no help to be given to the prisoners by the civilians, and there is a story authenticated by four French women two of them victims&apos; of the guard firing on and severely wounding them for trying to give food to the prisoners as they passed by. At Locquinol near Villers le Gagnicourt food.was very scanty and there were many deaths from exhaus-tion and starvation.3. Compulsory Work of a Military Nature.The evidence establishes that at 7 camps the prisoners were forced to do work of a military nature, this exclusive of such work as road repairing, railway work and the like. .At Bapaume, Denain, Queant, Marquion and Sailly, the prisoners were employed on ammunition dumps, unloading shells from the trains and loading them on to light railways or other means of conveyance to the front. At Denain and Hasmon some prisoners were set to dig trenches and gun pits. They had to place bombs in position for being fixed to aeroplanes at Maxquion and actually to carry shells to big guns in action at Villers le Cagnicourt.4. Exposure to Shell-fire.Prisoners were continually under Allied shell-fire.at Bapaume, Bresbieres, Marquion, Queant (1916-17) and Sailly. Many were killed and wounded at Brebieres and Bapaume,
At Douai they were sometimes under long range fire, while atVillers le Cagnicourt all their work some distance away from the camp seems to have been done under shell-fire, and one. day a shell fell right into the camp and killed four men.5. General brutality.From all the camps come similar stories of gross ill-treatment, beating and kicking- men who were starved and overworked because they did not work fast enough to please their taskmasters.If there is in this respect a special characteristic of this command it is to be found in the way in which sick men were treated. At Bapaume a man with septic running wounds.was forced to work without any medical attention; four men died at Denain without seeing the doctor at all. At Queant (1916-17) men died in scores; of 150 who went there in 1916 there were only 62 left in February, 1917, which is&apos; perhaps not to be wondered at, as their warm clothing was taken away in the bitter weather.At Marchiennes one man and at Prouvy two men died, directly or indirectly, of violence, but curiously enough from these two places comes evidence of those rare acts of consideration which throw the usual brutality into higher relief. One witness speaks warmly of the kindness he received from the doctors and nurses at the hospital at Marchiennes and another says that a doctor visited them three times a week at Prouvy and that he was &quot; decent.&quot;Second Army : General von der Marwitz.The front of the Second Army extended from about Albert to a point some 30 kil. S.W. of that place. This Army District differs from that last mentioned in this respect, that with a few exceptions mentioned below the prisoners do not seem to have been employed under shell-fire nor do they appear to have been so largely employed in work of a military nature. The char-acteristics of this command seem to be inadequate housing and sanitation and there is a curious variety of evidence with regard to the quantity, not quality, of the food supplied. The places with regard to which the principal evidence has been collected are:  Bellecourt (22).Brie (7).Fins (57).Gauzeaucourt (24).Hamel (25).Marpent (10).Maretz (69).Misery (18).Ors (7).Peronne (227).Roisel (91).Roussoy and Lempire (7, and 4 French). Trescourt (41).
1. Accommodation and Sanitation.Of Peronne and Roisel there appears to be no serious com-plaint, except that at the latter place the latrines were inside the hut in which the men lived, which led to a disgusting state of affairs.At Brie and Hamel the huts which were in a cage were much overcrowded. Serious complaints are made of the sani-tary conditions at Hamel, where 50 men. are said toi have died of dysentery and diarrhoea, induced by these conditions. At Marpent 200 to 300 men were put into a room which &quot; in the British Isles would have contained 2 platoons/&apos; while at Misery there was a marquee. These two camps were the best. The prisoners at Bellecourt were placed in a roofless stable, where the ground was damp and the place verminous. There were no arrangements for washing and the men &quot; lived like pigs.&quot; There was a large yard with no shelter of any kind at Fins. There were no beds, there was no washing water, it all had to be fetched in petrol tinst. This state of affairs lasted for two months after which improvements were made; meanwhile the prisoners put up such shelter as they could for themselves. Holes in the ground covered with &quot; old rags and iron sheeting &quot; were all the shelter the men got at Gauzeaucourt. At Ors they were placed in a house with hardly any roof, it was damp and there were no sanitary arrangements at all. A cotton factoly -sheltered the prisoners at Maretz from November, 1916, to May, 1917; there were entirely inadequate washing arrangements, and the sanitary conditions were disgusting. During the winter 1916-17, the prisoners lived in a shed with a cement floor ait Roussoy and Lempire. There were some, but not enough, beds, but no blankets or mattresses till February. Their overcoats were taken from the British, though the French and Russians are said to have been allowed to keep theirs. A large number suffered from dysentery and frost bite and it is said that out of 106 British who went to Roussoy in November there were only 46 left at the end of two months.   The rest had either died or were in hospital.2. Underfeeding and Overwork.The evidence with regard to the quantity of food varies a good deal. At Gauzeaucourt there is said to have been a starvation diet, and 70 died in a week. About 200&apos; grammes only of bread were allowed at Maretz, where some men were employed on a munition dump and the rest road mending. The former received soup at noon, the latter got no food till they returned at 7 p.m., having been at work since 6 a.m. At Ors, the. men were engaged in the very heavy work of quarrying granite. The food was totally insufficient. In October, 1917, 28 men died of starvation and neglect, 6 died in one night; while at Trescourt 250 men marched in in October, 1916 and by March, 1917, only 30 were left. The rest had broken down or died. The food was totally insufficient to support men doing leavy work.
On the other hand, at Roussoy and Lempire (two adjoining villages) the bread ration is given as from 300 to 500 grammes. At Roisel 400 grammes of bread were issued daily, while at Brie and Misery 500 grammes were the daily issue. The work at these two places seems to have been laying sleepers and lines. It did not begin till T.a.m. and ended at 6 p.m. with one hour off at midday for the soup. No deaths are actually attributed to starvation-tion at these two last mentioned camps, though 14 are said to have died of influenza, a statement which suggests the necessity of caution before accepting that all the deaths alleged to be due to starvation were really due to that cause. The statement may be incorrect as to the immediate cause, but the fact remains that the prisoners were worked to their utmost capacity on an insuffi-cient diet which has been calculated to contain no more than .1,300 to 1,500 calories while 2,500 at least are necessary to main-tain in health a man doing hard work, as was implied by the Hague Agreement of July, 1918. The gradual weakening of the prisoners would render them less able to resist the attacks of disease, and there is abundant evidence that tuberculosis, dysen-tery and oedema (the so-called &quot; dropsy &quot;) were rife.3. Work of a Military Nature.At two places, Hamel and Peronne,&apos; prisoners were made to work on shell dumps. At Gauzeaucourt they had to unload shells from motor lorries and take them to within half a mile of German guns in action, while at Roisel they were employed in the unpleasant task of loading up captured ammunition.4. Exposure to Shell-fire.At Gauzeaucourt alone in this command were prisoners exposed to shell-fire. Many deaths were caused by Allied gunfire among the men engaged in taking shells to the German guns. At Brie some deaths were caused by the bombs dropped by the Allies from aeroplanes, but the men were not exposed to gunfire.5. General Brutality.Prom all the camps in this command come complaints of great brutality. At Bellecourt men were severly thrashed for attempt-ing to escape and were afterwards tried and sentenced by court martial. Special attention is directed by the witnesses from Fins, Gauzeaucourt, Marpent, Roisel and Roussoy Lempire to the treatment of those who were sick from privation and over-work. They received no medical attention till it was too late. They were driven out to work with whips and sticks, and were forced to work till they were too weak to rise from their beds. It is alleged that at Marpent some men actually died under the hands of the men in charge and the interpreter. At Roisel the officer in charge (Piest) used a riding whip, striking those too weak to work. At Roussoy Lempire the terrible condition of the men is vouched by several French witnesses. They were driven to work with a long whip and men who ventured to report sick were punished.
From Peronne there is much evidence of ill-treatment and one man at least died of the ill-treatment he received. But the worst place of all was Maretz, said by one man to&apos; be the worst camp in Germany or the occupied districts. The Feldwebel used to drive the men out of their sleeping quarters with a dog whip; on one occasion the officer in charge stood at the exit of the men&apos;s quarters and thrashed each man as he passed with a stick until it broke and he then armed himself with stones which he threw at them. Three men at least were shot here. One man was shot for receiving food from a French civilian a story corroborated by French witnesses, one of whom offered the food to the man. Another man who fell behind from exhaustion on his return from work was shot by a drunken sentry who after-wards bayonetted him and pushed him into a ditch. A third who had been working in a spirit store got drunk and was shot because he could not walk back to camp. The sick were brutally treated, being hit and kicked out of their quarters and forced to go to work. Two men treated in this way and dragged out to work were carried back and died the same night. Two men attempted to escape and were first unmercifully beaten and then placed against a wall with their arms above their heads holding a large pot of boiling water. If they moved the water fell on them and scalded them-. This went on with intervals of cells for 14 days and the whole camp was made to stand to attention from 4 p.m. to midnight and resume work as usual the next morning.Eighteenth Army : General von Hutier.The front of this Army extended from the southern limit of the second army to a point about 15 kil. S.E. of No yon. It seems to have been at the edge of, or outside, the sphere of the British armies, and apparently for, that reason there are only 5 camps of any importance with regard to which the Sub-Com-rnittee has received substantial evidence. Flavy-le-Martel, however, has the distinction of being possibly the worst camp on the Western Front.   The places are:  Cagny (17). Damery (10). Flavy-le-Martel (61). IIam (7). St. Quentin (24).1. Accommodation and Sanitation.Damery is said to have been much overcrowded; there is no special complaint of Cagny. At Flavy-le-Martel there were about 1,200 prisoners, for whom only 3 huts were provided. The men were terribly overcrowded, and had to lie on the damp earth without beds, straw or blankets. To get water, either for drink-ing or washing, the men had to walk about 500 yards from the camp.   For washing there was a horse trough, the water in
which were changed once a fortnight. The men were infested with vermin, many of them being masses of lice sores; the huts were filthy. There were open latrines, quite inadequate in number, and the whole camp (about 300 yards across) became foul with excreta. No prisoners were detailed to attend to sanitary matters, and a request to the Commandant to form a sanitary squad was refused. Dysentery was rife, the men being in a thoroughly exhausted condition from starvation. There were daily deaths in the camp. The number is variously stated, but seems to have been about 100. There were successively 3 doctors. The first two were incompetent or callous; the third took serious steps to remedy the state of affairs. He told a staff officer that of 1,000 men 950 were unfit owing to inattention, bad sanitary conditions and lack of food, and said the conditions had become so bad that the men could not be kept there. The men were moved. The condition in which they were will appear in a later section of this report.At Ham the men were kept for 14 days in an open field with-out any shelter at all; while at St. Quentin they were housed in a shattered lycee without beds, mattresses or blankets; there were no heating arrangements. Some men had to sleep in a stable from which the manure had never been removed. The latrines were filthy, and the men suffered acutely from exhaustion and dysentery.2. Underfeeding and Overwork.Men had very heavy railway work at Cagny, and suffered from the &quot; usual starvation.&quot; At Flavy-le-Martel the bread ration was from 300 to 400 grammes a day until the third doctor arrived. He insisted on its being raised to 600&apos; grammes during the rest of the time- the men were kept there. The work was from 6 a,m. to 4 p,m., and frequently the men were kept on parade, on some excuse or another, for 2 or 3 hours after their return to camp.At Ham the prisoners had severe labour on shell dumps and railways. If a man reported sick, his ration was here, as in many other places, cut down to half.At St. Quentin the work was carrying shells, burying the dead and other similar fatigues, and breaking machinery. It was very severe, and lasted from 12 to sometimes 18 hours out of the 24, often during the night. The bread ration was only 200 to 300 grammes a day.3. Work of a Military Nature.At all the camps in this command except Daniery the prisoners were employed on shell dumps, shifting ammunition, loading shells into lorries, or carrying shells from one point to another.4. Exposure to Shell-fire.There is no evidence that at any of the camps the prisoners were exposed to shell-fire.
ted uts in one I to p a ing lore ted, ply pird rtaff !bad fhad en inGeneral Brutality.From each of the camps in the command come the usual stories of men being driven to their work with sticks, whips and ifle. butts. St. Quentin and Flavy-le-Martel were the worst. One witness relates that an officer unnamed kicked &quot; a Scotch lad to death &quot; at the former place. At the latter, Hauptmann Miiller was in charge. Owing to the conditions already lescribed, dysentery was rampant. As the men became weaker, sticks and rifle butts were freely used to enforce the required amount of labour. The mortality was very high, and various estimates place the number of deaths at 2 to 5 or 6 daily. The terrible conditions which existed in this camp and their results ire supported by more, and more convincing, evidence than is ivailable in the case of any place except, perhaps, Lille and Fort Macdonald.ith-in ere fable ines andSeventh Army : General von Boehm.The next Army was towards the south-east.   There are only three camps with regard to which the Sub-Committee has received etailed information, viz.:   Laon (22). Rame1 court (32). Soissons (2).Accommodation and Sanitation.Laon was overcrowded; between May and September, 1918, here  were  some  6,000  prisoners here,  of whom 2,000 to ,000 were  British.   The  camp  of  Rameeourt,   if  such it an be called, was formed by running barbed wire round few wrecked houses of the village and the men had to lie at was light either on the stone floors  or  in  the open  through-it ob int the whole period.   The roofs gaped and let in water, and doors uid windows were non-existent, and, in spite of the comparatively ettled character of the camp, no attempt of any kind wras made and o relieve the privations of the men or to make the camp more is inhabitable.   There were a few bits of sacking for bed clothing n the houses, and a witness complains that- as the British usually the^ot back from work last they had to lie in the field without overing of any kind.  From Soissons there is no special com-laint of the accommodation.Erom ition J ictor iringIut.o: onljonerUnderfeeding and Overwork. ,From Laon there is nothing more than the usual complaintbout food, except that the food was reduced if men went sick. Lt Ramecourt the bread ration is stated to have been f lb., and ,.   n addition the prisoners received a pint of thin soup and 2 pints 1 ^ f coffee- said to have been made of hawthorn berries.   On this llier* list men were expected to doi hard manual labour for 8 hours day, exclusive of the march to and from their place of labour, he men became very emaciated, and when they reported sick onerfieir bread ration was cut off.At Soissons the results of underfeeding and heavy work were lerrible,   One man says that out of 1,500 not more than 300
were left in September, .1.9.18. &quot; About 100 tried to escape, the rest died of dysentery and starvation.&quot;3. Work of a Military Nature.Prisoners were made to work on shell dumps at Laon from 4 a.m. to 6 p.in.   Some were killed and many wounded.At Ramecourt the prisoners had to carry, shells, ,in somt cases, even to the guns. They were compelled to clear ai ammunition train which had been bombed, the exploding shells killing about 30 British prisoners. The Germans had declined the task on the ground that prisoners of war ought to do this dangerous work.4. Exposure to Shell fire.There appears to be no direct evidence that prisoners were exposed to shellfire in this command. At Ramecourt, however, where the men had to carry ammunition to the guns the] could hardly have escaped exposure. No,casualties are reported however, from this cause. I.5&apos;. General Brutality.At Laon men were beaten with sticks, kicked, and hit with rifle butts. Dogs were set on them. Men were refused medical treatment. A &quot; straf &quot; or reprisal company of 250 men, formed here in the summer of 1918, had only 49 men left on November 8th Similar treatment was meted out at Soissons. At Ramecourt when the doctor (an American, who did bis best) ordered &quot; medicine and duty,&quot; the bread ration was stopped the first day and the soup as well cut off the next day. There were mam deaths and much sickness from starvation and dysentery.Weak and sick prisoners were treated with much brutality by the guards in order to force them toi work. This practice was encouraged by an order which the German Feldwebel real out: &quot; If any prisoner refuses to obey orders or is insubordinati the guards have full permission to use the rifle, stick, or boot on the prisoners.&quot; The Commandant appears to have been i Colonel, who is well spoken of, but the Sergi-Major seems t( have taken advantage of his superior^ absences. \First Army : General Fritz von Below.Rheims was somewhere about the centre of the front, whicl extended between 30 and 45 kilos east and west of that city.Information has been received with regard to the followiiij places:  Amifontaine (15). Aquilcourt (8). Bazancourt (12). Courville (18). Pontavert (12). Rethel(m). Vendhuille (10).
1. Accommodation and Sanitation.At Amifontaine there was a hut containing- wire bunks, but it could only contain a small proportion of the men, many of whom had to sleep in the open without overcoats, blankets, or shelter. There was no water for drinking- or washing. Aquilcourt was even worse. No shelter was provided. The men made such bivouacs of brushwood as they could. Many of them had to sleep in the open in all weathers Avithout any covering. No blankets were provided and the men&apos;s overcoats and puttees had been taken from them. At Bazancourt there were some huts, but they were overcrowded. In August of 1918 more huts were built. The prisoners were given one thin blanket only and there was no heating apparatus. A night latrine was made in the hut, which was moist offensive. There were no washing facilities till August.At Courville no blankets at all were provided. In May and June, 1918, there were 1,500 prisoners at Pontavert. The men slept in a wood, bivouacs being made out of pieces of wood, corrugated iron, and tarpaulin which they obtained from an old French dump. They had to lie on the ground. Water was obtainable from a well. Prom Rethel come no special com-plaints of accommodation, the attention of the men who have made statements being concentrated on the brutal treatment they received there. Yendhuille was occupied from November, 1916, to March, 1917. At first there was no cover at all, and for nearly three months there were no blankets. After a time a large corrugated iron shed was erected and two small wooden huts. Owing to defective construction large icicles hung down from the roof in the frost of 1916-17. As these melted they dripped on to the men, who were constantly wet. In the harder weather the men sometimes found their blankets frozen. So great was the cold in the shed that the men sleeping on the top bunks were covered with hoar frost in the morning, and men wrere found frozen to death. There were no washing facilities and the men became very verminous.2. Underfeeding and Overwork.The food was very scanty and bad at Amifontaine. The prisoners were given such food as there was before they started work in the early morning and again on their return at night. There, seems to have been no mid-day meal. The men were so reduced that they collected dandelions, nettles, and potato peelings, and the Frenchmen caught and ate rats.The prisoners did get a mid-day meal at Aquilcourt, but the work, pulling down old buildings, pushing trucks full of stones, building bridges and light railways, and loading ammunition, was very heavy and, including the time of going and returning, extended to 10&apos; or 12 hours daily. The men were reduced to eating potato peelings and nettles. The German guards were much better fed. At Bazancourt the prisoners received 400 grammes of bread and the usual soup and substitute coffee, besides sometimes a little palm-oil butter or a spoonful of jam, but no
meat.  The German guards received 700 grammes of bread andprobably a little meat, The prisoners had to work seven days in the week, the work being similar to that at Aquilcourt. They were reduced to skin and bone. At Courville the food is described as scanty and bad, while at Pontavert one witness says the bread ration was as low as 3 or 4 oz. a day; another says one loaf was divided between three men with a spoonful of jam or butter. The work on railways and ammunition dumps was very heavy. Two men from here were photographed at Fulham Hospital m their return. The photographs show what their emaciated con-dition was then. At Rethel the food was bad and insufficient for the heavy work exacted, and even the meagre allowance was cut down when the men reported sick.The food at Vendhuille was just as bad, and the work, unload-ing granite and heavy bags of cement from barges and digging trenches in the hard ground, severe.$ ifrj&quot;^ &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;V:&apos;&apos;V.:&apos;   v3. Compulsory Work of a Military Nature.At Amifontaine, Bazancourt and Rethel no work of this nature seems to have been exacted, but at Aquilcourt, Courville, and Pontavert men were forced to work on shell dumps and to load ammunition into lorries for carriage to the guns; while at Vend-huille, in the winter of 1916-17, the prisoners were made to dig trenches.4. Exposure to Shellfire.Only at Aquilcourt were the prisoners within range of the guns, but no casualties were caused, for it is said that the French knew the position of the camp and avoided it.5. General Brutality.At Aquiloourt the Feldwebel is said to have treated the men &quot; fairly well,&quot; but the guards struck them with sticks and rifle butts even when sick. Unless they showed external signs of ill-ness, such as actual injuries, they were not excused work.At Amifontaine conditions were much the same, except that here there seems to, have been a. daily medical parade, but it is clear that men were worked until they were so weak that it only remained to send them to hospital or Germany.        *Bazancourt had a comparatively good record. A considerable number of witnesses complain of flogging, kicking and the usual ill-treatment, but one witness says the German Feldwebel was) &quot; a good sort, and if a prisoner played the game with him he did the same.&quot;At Pontavert too the treatment seems; to have been better than usual. There^ was the usual endeavour to make sick and weak men work beyond their capacity, but one man observes that the. Feldwebel treated the prisoners well, as did the guards &quot;except when officers were about.&quot;The record of Rethel is, however, very bad. The brutality to the worn-out sick men could hardly be exceeded.   The men were
exhausted by hard work, exposure and lack of medical attention. It seems to be well established that out of 168 British prisoners, who went there as one party in Aiigust, 1917, there were only 60 left in five weeks. The remainder had died or gone to hospital through the insanitary conditions and lack of food. One witness gives the names and regiments of 14 men who died between the 10th October, 1917, and the 17th January, 1918, while another says that when he left in March, 1918, there were only 18 of the original 168 left. Throughout the whole period the treatment by the Germans was very bad. It is even said that only four men daily were allowed to report sick. The rest desirous of so doing were driven to work with kicks and blows with rifle butts, no matter how ill they were, and some are said actually to have died on the way back to. camp or immediately after their arrival.Yendhuille was little better. Men received similar treatment even when they fell down from sheer exhaustion. They were punished for attempting to beg food from French civilians. One man was shot for leaving the ranks to pick up a piece of bread, and another for being slightly drunk on a working party. One prisoner whose poisoned arm was slung in a wire cage to keep it rigid was forced at the point of the bayonet to saw wood and lay bricks with his other hand.Third Army : General von Einem.The area of the Third Army was just to the east of the First Army. There is only one place with regard to which evidence has been received.Tannay (18).Tannay was a small camp of about 60 men. From May to October, 1918, the treatment was extremely bad and the sufferings of the men very great, resulting in many deaths. The food was so bad and so inadequate that on one occasion the men struck work and were violently attacked and ill-treated by the guards. The daily treatment was exceptionally brutal, and it is said that the Sergeant in charge encouraged it, especially when complaints were made.The work was at saw mills. The accommodation was a hut only 30 yards square and so filthy and verminous that the men slept outside whenever possible. It is said that many died from dysentery, starvation and brutal treatment. This is corroborated by an orderly in Charleville Hospital, who says that the men admitted from Tannay especially were mere skeletons, and that a number died within a few hours after admission.Two witnesses mention the death of two men in the camp owing to blows and being brutally forced to work when ill.The name of the Commandant of the camp is given four times, twice as Lieut. Tittner and twice as Lieut. Tippner. He is said to have been in charge of No. 1 Company, 87th Battalion, at the saw miBs at Tannay. A witness says that the Commandant stood by and laughed whilst his men kicked and struck on the head two men who died from the effects of this treatment.
Nineteenth Army : General von Bothmer.The area occupied by this army was to the eastward of Metz. Information has reached the Sub-Committee relating to one camp only in his command, viz.:  St ArvoU (18). 1. Accommodation.Unoccupied stables, of which the roof leaked badly when it rained. Some of the men had to lie in the open fields from July to September, 1918. The place was overcrowded, there were 100 men in one small hut &quot;that in our camps was provided for 30 men.&quot;   The sanitation was bad.2. Underfeeding and Overwork. The food was insufficient and bad.3. Compulsory Worh of a Military Nature.The prisoners were employed in carrying shells and construct-ing a light railway to the shell dumps.4. Exposure to Sh&amp;llfire.The prisoners do not seem to have been exposed to shellfire.5. General Brutality.The treatment was consistently brutal. Men were knocked about with sticks, whips and butts of rifles. One man had two ribs broken. Many men died and many more had to go to hospital &quot;with nothing more the matter but brutal treatment and hard &quot; work.&quot;Other Armies.The Sub-Committee has not received information with regard to any camps in the areas of other armies mentioned earlier in this report.Medical Evidence.So far this report; has been based on the evidence of the N.C.Os. and men who actually underwent or witnessed the experi-ences described. It may be said by some that it is exaggerated and unreliable, but fortunately there is available a considerable body of evidence as to the condition of the men working behind the lines from medical officers who were captured during the German advance of 1918 and were working in the hospitals either in the area of operations or in the interior of Germany. In two cases at least formal courts of enquiry were held by British medical officers at Bachant in the area of operations and at Cassel in the interior of Germany.  The conclusion was the same in each
case, that the condition of the men was due to gross under-feeding, exposure to hardships and overwork.The following may be taken as typical. Capt. Meighan, R.A.M.C., gives the numbers, amounting in all to 2,530, of four batches of prisoners who arrived at Stendal from the Western Front, where they had all been working since their capture. He proceeds, &quot; with the exception of the last convoy (of 881) the 1&quot;&apos; general conditions of these men were terrible. Starvation, &apos;&apos; vermin and insufficient clothing were the most striking &quot; features; 50 per cent, required immediate hospital treatment. &quot; Stories of cruelty were everywhere heard. Many arrived with &quot; sores undressed for days, the sores themselves covered with lice. &apos;&apos; They were indeed more animals than men, and several died &apos;&apos; on the clay of admission. The main causes of death were &quot; primarily starvation and hardships leading to an epidemic of &quot; pneumonia and diarrhoea. As an additional factor of proof of &quot;the condition of the men who arrived at Stendal from behind &quot;the line, it is stated that at least 50 per cent, suffered from &quot; oedema of legs and face.   This condition is described by theGermans as &apos; hunger oedema.&apos; &quot; This is, no doubt, the condition which the men themselves described as &quot;dropsy.&quot;It is unnecessary to give further extracts from the medical evidence. It is all to the same effect and establishes beyond doubt the deplorable condition to which the prisoners were reduced.Two points not directly dealing with the medical condition of the men should, however, be mentioned.Colonel Milne Thompson, R.A.M.C., A.D.M.S., 50th Division, was captured at the end of May, 1918, and kept at St. Giles from June 13th to July 8th. He says: &quot; the men working behind the lines were not registered. From what I knew their mortality was perfectly appalling, simply from starvation. The rations the Germans themselves had were quite good. We were given German rations and were told they were what the Germans had. They have the food, but will not give it to the prisoners, it is part of an organised campaign of cruelty.&quot;Captain Moore, R.A.M.C., of Nova Scotia, was detained for some time behind the lines, at Guise, and for a week at Fresnoy-le-Grand, in September, 1918. He gives detailed evidence of the state of the prisoners and adds details of acts of brutality which he himself witnessed at the latter place, where men were grossly ill-treated. &quot; This was absolute brutality, because the men were not slow through stubbornness but because of their weakness they could not move any faster.&quot; This officer had exceptional oppor-tunities of observing the condition of the&apos;men who came from Flavy-le-Martel and Fresnoy, two of the worst places on the Western Front. He says, &quot; the treatment of the British prisoners behind the German lines was one of the vilest outrages against humanity and civilisation that the world has ever seen &quot; and expresses his desire to help to bring the offenders to justice. The Sub-Committee considers his evidence to be so valuable that, though Captain Moore&apos;s address is given at a place in Nova Scotia, it thinks that he ought to be called as a witness.
The following is a list of the different places where medical officers had an opportunity of seeing the condition of the men,and the names of some of the medical officers who- examined them. (The letters M.O. followed by a number refer to the printed statements taken by the Government Committee. The others are not printed.) No doubt further evidence could be obtained if necessary.A..

H. S. Goodacre, R.A.M.C., as to the condition of men from Flavy-le-Martel and Cugny, and Sergi-Major Tilly, 10th Essex, as to the former. From Cassel, 3.1655 L/C. B. J. Smith, 45th Brig., R.F.A. From Rastatt as to the condition of men from Ramecourt, 4460 Pte. A. A. Saunders, R.A.M.C. (orderly at the Lazaret). 50228 Sergt. H. F. Houlder, R.A.M.C., as to the men from Fresnoy-le-Grand; from Stendal C.S.M. Nay lor, 7 R.W.K., and 200417 Rfn. G. W. Feakes, 9th K.R.R., as b. the men from Flavy-le-Martel; and Pte. T. Allen, 9224, 2nd Border Regiment and Arthur Adams, 17th Middlesex, who were working in the hospital at Gottingen, as to the condition of men from the Western Front generally.The list could be indefinitely extended, but it is suggested that it is unnecessary to add more. If the evidence of the doctors does not carry conviction, the evidence of less trained men will not convince the tribunals.A. large volume of additional evidence can be obtained from the medical staffs at Fulham and other hospitals to which the men were sent on their repatriation. Many photographs were taken which will be of the utmost value.From what has been stated above it will be abundantly clear that the Germans disregarded not only their own engagements as to the treatment of the prisoners in the occupied districts, but also every instinct of humanity. That the men were not pro-vided with proper shelter, that they were set to work of a nature prohibited by International Law, that they were forced to do it by the utmost brutality, that they were starved and worked until they could not do another hour&apos;s work and then were sent off to hospital or to Germany, if they had not died, is abundantly established. To these facts must be added the circumstances that the names of the prisoners captured were frequently not notified, and that when allowed to write they were forced to give an address in the interior of Germany to which their friends sent parcels which often were not forwarded.The story of their journey to Germany is heartrending. Men died in the train, their bodies being taken out at stations en route or at the terminus.   Arrived at the hospital, many more died
within the first 24 hours, and often a large percentage (up to 30 per cent., it is said, in some cases) within the next three or four weeks.Responsibility.The question now presents itself, who was responsible for this state of affairs? Before deaJling with such evidence as there is bearing on this question it will be useful to try to form some conclusion as to the organisation of the prisoners of war in the occupied districts.Piecing the evidence together it appears that the prisoners of war were organised into battalions apparently called &quot; Kriegs-gefangenen Arbeit Bataillonen.&quot; Each of these battalions seems to have been commanded by a major, or by an&quot; officer of higher rank, and to have been divided into companies commanded by Lieutenants. Whether these battalions were composite bodies composed of different nationalities it has not been possible to determine, but the British prisoners often mention that they belonged to such and such an E.K. (Englander Kommando) occasionally adding the number of the Kriegsgefangenen Arbeit Bataillon.The evidence examined seems to show that at different times the following units were at the places named:  E.K. III.   Hamel and Marchiennes (17th Army).E K VII ^0 ^   I -^resnes (17th Army). E.K. V. (part).   Tournai and Raisines (6th Army). E.K. V., Co. 3.   Tournai (6th Army) and Wez (17th Army). E.K. VI.  Cambrai (17th Army) Roisel (2nd Army). E.K. IX., Co. 2.   Marpent (2nd Army). E.K. XIII. (part).   Bellecourt (2nd Army) and Ramecourt (7th Army).E.K. XIX., Co. 1.   Maulde Montagne (6th Army). E.K. XIX., Co, 3.   St. Armand (17th Army). E.K. XIX., Co. 4.   Tournai and Raisines (6th Army). E.K. XX. (part).   Douai and Denain (17th Army). E.K. XX., Co. 3.   Bapaume (17th Army). E.K. XXL, Co. 4.   Cambrai and D6nain (17th Army) and Moeuvres (2nd Army). E.K. V seems also to have been called, or to have formed part of, the 69th K.A.B., and E.K. VI. to have been called, or to have formed part of the 75th K.A.B.Erom the above it would appear that these E.K. were units which in whole or in part were moved about as they were required and ordered by some superior authority.The Lieutenants in charge of a company wrere presumably responsible for the general treatment but probably not for the quarters or medical care of the men in their company or for the nature of the work on which they were employed. The wider responsibility must be sought higher.There probably was a General in supreme command of all the K.A.B. once they reached the area of operations, and there are the following grounds for thinking that the General was General von
Trotte: he is mentioned as being- the responsible officer signing notices, orders, &amp;c. at six places in the 17th Army area, viz., Denain, Fresnes, Locquinol (where he is said to have &quot;; inspected &quot; the prisoners), Marchiennes, Prouvy and Raisines, and at one place in the 6th Army -District, Maulde Montagne, and at two places&apos; in the 2nd Army District, Bellecourt and Hasmon. It will be noticed that the 17th Army area is touched on the North and South by the 6th and 2nd Army areas, It may he, of course, that the true position of the places in the 6th and 2nd areas has been mistaken : hut looking at the position of Mons at the apex of a triangle of which the fronts of the 6th, 17th and 2nd Armies formed the base, the suggestion is hazarded that von Trotte&apos;s headquarters were there and that he is the author of the notices set out below.General von Koch is stated by an exceptionally intelligent witness, Lance-Corpora! Sugg, to have inspected the prisoners at Denain. This witness stated that General von Koch informed him that the treatment of the British was no worse than that which the German prisoners received in England where tongues and eyes were cut out. General von Koch refused, to improve con-ditions.   This is an important statement as it proves deliberation.One other General, not in command of an army, is mentioned by name, namely General von Luitzel, who  is referred to by 2216 Pte. C. H. Alien, 17 R. Fusiliers, as the responsible person at Hollain (near Tournai) in the 6th Army District.Only two Generals in command of armies are mentioned by name as responsible. General von Below, in command of the 17th Army where most British prisoners were at work, is said by .105394 Pte. G. M. Tyerman, M.G.C., to have signed orders exhibited at Denain and, by 16268 Pte E. C. Hyde, 2 Essex, those exhibited at Marchiennes.General von Arnim in command of the 4th Army is said by 232809 Lance-Corporal Barret, 1/2 London, to have been respon-sible at LeCateau (in the 2nd Army), but the date does not appear, and it has to be remembered that the Army areas given are as at June, .1918, and von Arnim may have been at Le Cateau earlier. General von Bissing is said by William Eustace, 10, Hulme Street, Burnley, to have signed notices exhibited in the prisoners of war camp at Tournai.Lastly, Dame Adelaide Livingstone states that the Mayor of Le Quesnoy says that General von Arnim and his adjutants were fully aware of the state of affairs and the conditions of the prisoners and that the German doctors had assured him that they were ashamed of the condition of starvation in which the British prisoners frequently arrived at the hospital there.Witnesses implicating Generals.

The evidence implicating individual officers of high rank is not very voluminous but -there is more convincing evidence throw-ing the responsibility still higher and making it clear that the ill-treatment pf British prisoners was deliberate and in its incep tion intended as a reprisal.A copy of a notice issued to British prisoners behind the Glerman lines in 1917 has been supplied by Corporal J. McKenzie, at present residing at 171, Slaterfield Street, Dennistoun, Glasgow.   It runs as follows:  &quot; Upon the German request to withdraw the German prisoners of war to a distance of not less than 30 kilometres from the front line, the British Government has not replied. Therefore it has been decided that all prisoners of war who will be taken in future will be kept in as prisoners of respite. That is, very short food, bad lodging, no beds, hard work beside the German guns under shell fire, no pay, no soap for washing or shaving, no baths, towels or boots, &amp;c. You English prisoners of war will be allowed to write to your relatives or persons of influence in England telling them how badly you are being treated and that no alteration in the treatment will occur until the English Government has consented to the German request. It is there-fore in the interest of all English prisoners of respite to do their best to remove all English prisoners of respite to camps in ,Ger-many where they will be properly treated with good food, good clothes, &amp;c, &amp;c. You will succeed by writing as mentioned above and then surely the English Government will consent to Germany&apos;s request for the sake of her own country men. You will be issued with postcards, paper and envelopes. All this correspondence in which you will explain your hardships will be sent express mail to England.&quot;(A similar copy appears in the printed statement of Peaehey an Australian: number 1055.)At Yendhuille (1128 Pte. R. G. Stark, 13 E. Yorks and 3579 L/Cpl. J. Easton, 16 H.L.I.), Roiissoy-Lempire (3579 L/Cpl. J. Eastop, 16 H.L.I.), and Flavy-le-Martel in 1918 (203937 Rfm. C. H. Mills, 9 K.R.R., and 30237 Pte. R. Mater 7 R.W.K.) the prisoners were told the ill-treatment was a reprisal, and the observation of General ICoch already referred to can bear no other construction. That observation was made in 1918, not-withstanding the fact that on February 8th, 1917, the British Government had replied to the German complaint, and on the 27th April, 1917, had telegraphed that orders had been given to remove the prisoners outside the 30 kilometres limit. The terms of the notice invite careful attention. It will be observed that it stated that all prisoners of war taken in future will be treated in the manner described.The threat was carried out to the letter right up to the Armis-tice notwithstanding that by an earlier agreement re-affirmed in Article 28 of the Hague Agreement dated July .14th, 1918, it was provided that no prisoners should be employed within 30 kilometres of the front line.
Turning now to another point it was expressly agreed by Article 46 of the last mentioned Agreement that the daily calorific value of the food supplied should not in any case fall below 2,500 calories for ordinary workers and 2,850 for heavy workers. The bread ration was not to be less than 250 grammes with the addition of bread or other cereals in the case of ordinary and heavy workers respectively. The making of this Agreement so late as July, 1918, seems to the Sub-Committee of vital importance for two reasons. First it established a standard, for it cannot be suggested the Germans proposed to overfeed their prisoners. Second, it shows that the Germans were in a position to give adequate food, for it cannot be sxiid by them at all.events  that they entered into an Agreement knowing that they could not and would not keep it. If they found themselves in difficulties there is no possible justification for the issue of the notices to which reference will now be made prohibiting civilians giving food to men who were obviously starving. At Mons, which appears to be in the district of the 17th Army, the Kom-mandantur issued a notice dated April 4th, 1918. &quot; II est absolument interdit de parler aux prisonniers ou de leur passer des lettres, des vivres, on cfautres objets quelconques. Les in-fractions a cette prescription seront punies d&apos;un emprisonnement pouvant s&apos;elever a 3 ans, ou d&apos;une amende pouvant atteindre .10,000 mark.&quot;On the 28th July, 1918 (a fortnight after the agreement at the Hague) the same Kommandantur issued a further notice which contained the following :  &apos;&apos; Malgre la defense communique a diffei*entes reprises la population Beige donne en cachette ou jette encore des vivres et des objets de toutes especes aux prisonniers. Les Bourgo-mestres out a faire connaitre a la population Beige que les in-fractions a cette ordre seront punies avec la plus grande severite.&quot; This was repeated in substance early in September, and on September 9th, 1918, a further notice was issued :  &quot; La Kommandantur a fait defendre de donner ou de jeter aux prisonniers des cadeaux ou des vivres, ou de paider avec eux. Malgre cette defense, de nombreuses infractions ont ete sigiialees. La Kommandantur ayant pour tache de maintenir 1&apos;ordre le plus strict, les soldats de surveillance ont recu Tin-struction de faire usage, le cas echeant, ale leurs armes a feu. La population est mise en garde contre toute nouvelle infraction. La population rend un mauvais service aux prisonniers, ceux-ci etamt punis a leur tour, pour avoir accepte des cadeaux.&quot;Original prints of these notices are in the files of the Sub-Committee.That this order was literally carried out and both civilians and soldiers were shot for giving and receiving food appears else-where in this report.The order for the so-called but entirely unjustifiable reprisal, and the orders preventing the supply of food by civilians, cannot have been issued without the highest authority and it is sub-mitted that the higher command stand convicted by its own
documents of intentionally causing the dreadful sufferings which the British prisoners endured from early in 1917 to November, 1918. The German authorities in pursuance of an agreement made at the Hague, sent General Hartog, in the late summer of 1918 to the Western Front to make investigations. The Sub-Committee deems it desirable to add here a copy of his report dated 3rd October, 1918, as an indication of what the German answer is likely to be.Report on visits to British and French Prisoners-of-War Camps,of 3rd October, 1918.1. General.Campa under the 6th Army (A.O.K. Lille), 4th Army (   ,,    Roubaix), .17th Army (   ,,    Denain), 2nd Army (   ,,    Catelet near Peronne),were visited. We were treated with every consideration by all service bodies. Motor cars were placed at our disposal so that we could visit the furthest and most out-of-the-way camps.At all camps I held personal conversations with the British. Apart from unimportant matters practically the only complaints made referred to the fact that no parcels had as yet reached them from home. (See No. 9.) It was evident that all Commandants were anxious to care for the prisoners and provide amelioration.2. 3.0 km. Zone.All the British have come in behind this Zone.3. Housing.Under the fifth and fourth armies this is good throughout. In view of the altered, conditions prevailing under the 17th and 2nd Army the housing varies more, and in many cases, not so good though ample throughout.Best Quarters. Former British Artillery emplacements in the houseless district of the Siegfried position; round narrow corru-gated iron huts to accommodate six persons naturally confined and dark but not worse than, the quarters that the British occupied on their front.Other Quarters. Factories, farms, old barracks, casemates, soldiers&apos; quarters, &amp;c. At no camp were complaints brought forward. Even in the emplacement camps the British, on being interrogated, said that under war conditions no complaints could be made of their quarters.Provision has or will be made everywhere for sufficient washing and latrine accommodation. There was no serious lack of such anywhere, and a bath or double douche once a week was general in almost all camps.4. Rationing.500 gr. of bread and in some cases until recently up to 600 gr. daily.   The bread is excellent.   The weekly meat ration varies
between 300 and 1,000 grammes. This is cooked together with vegetables. Each individual received 1 to litres. In the evening herrings and good cheese are provided amongst other things. The cooking is done by the prisoners. That for the guards separately. No complaints anywhere as to quality of food. In isolated instances requests for increased rations or that of sauerkraut should be left out, although one of the British very reasonably admitted he did not see how the use of this vegetable could entirely be discontinued. Under the 4th Army parti-cular stress is laid on good feeding. Increase in weight is noticed by means of regular weighing. Most of the prisoners have good enamelled utensils as well as a knife and fork.5. Employment.The longest spell of work was eight hours, including the journey to and fro in many cases the working hours were less. In most instances the men were marched back to camp for dinner, and work continued in the afternoon. In a few cases the work is not interrupted until 2 or 3 p.m., but then it concludes for the day. The nature of the work varies considerably. Excepting upon the lines of communication the prisoners work in quarries (loading stone), at army aircraft works, in building roads, &amp;c. I have watcbed them while so employed. Nowhere is the work excess-sively hard. No complaints were made anywhere. Almost with-out exception Camp Commandants told me the British worked perfectly willingly.6. Clothing.The British bring good clothing with them. In so far as they already receive mails from home they receive thence strong black cloth clothing as well as shoes. In the camps they have mostly to wear wooden shoes.7. Health.In general the number of cases of sickness is not great, only in some cases the Spanish complaint has raised the average of sickness. Provision has been made for proper sick wards and medical control and supervision. In general the British look surprisingly well and fresh. Here and there one certainly sees remarkedly young, almost childish looking, prisoners who, how-ever, are all at least 19 years of age. Weakly prisoners or such as look unwell had been all captured in that state, their condi-tion being due to the effects of gas. Their recovery is difficult and many cannot pull round notwithstanding the greatest care being taken of them and the provision of ample diet. Only in the case of such, and then only rarely, have deaths occurred. Prisoners who cannot recuperate or who have jfone through severe illnesses are placed for some weeks in a sanatorium for prisoners of war. Under the 4th Army Corps such a home is situated in a monastery standing in a large park. The patients here sleep a great deal, receive more food and are twice daily taken into the park, remaining there for a long time.,
8. Discipline.The British are willing&apos;. They hardly ever require to be punished the best -discipline is maintained where an elderly energetic British non-commissioned officer is placed in authority. In the large camp in the spinning mill at Roubaix, previously described as good, the conduct, appearance and bearing of the men under the control of an elderly Colonial non-commissioned officer of 20 years&apos; standing was exemplary. Attempts to escape hardly ever occur. The non-commissioned officers had as a matter of fact been already in many instance^ transferred to Germany. In so far as that had not already happened they urgently asked to be transferred because having lived together with their subordinates led to unpleasantness, excepting in cases such as that cited above.9. Mails and Relief Parcels.All prisoners, both British and French, sent home their first postcards within 8 to 14 days of their capture. This fact was established beyond doubt on the evidence of individuals and whole camps who were interrogated. The majority of the prisoners on their arrival at their present working camps bave written the permitted maximum of letters and cards. This had only been forbidden in some few camps under the 4th Army until recently owing to a misunderstanding. The prisoners tbus affected were therefore permitted to write two extra letters. Although the first cards were posted two or three months ago only the prisoners in some camps under the 6th and 2nd Armies have so far received any mails or relief parcels. This fact constituted almost tbe only complaint of the British, but it is general and very bitter. They imagine that the parcels are for some reason being detained at tbe parent camp. As relief parcels are all the more desired seeing that there are no canteens where the prisoners can buy food, I directed the Camp Commandant to urge by means of enquiry, &amp;c, the competent service bodies and parent camps to forward on at once all parcels arriving. The camps where the postal service was in full working order were more than sufficiently well pro-vided with parcels, thus at Maulde for 335 British 1,600 parcels had already been received. Contents: Preserved meat, milk, chocolate, tea, coffee, cigarettes, rice,&apos; &amp;c, clothing and boots. Sacks containing white bread (much of it mouldy). Much could consequently have been sent on to otter camps had these been bulk supplies and not private parcels. The former are more practical for the prisoners in the sphere of operations and on the lines of communication.Conclusion. From the foregoing it is apparent the British in the places visited by me are to say the least sufficently well housed and fed (sometimes even better), also that none are worked too hard or too long, and that they are well treated.Beyond the desire for early news and parcels from home, they themselves expressed neither wishes nor complaints. They give the impression of being healthy and quite contented.
No British are any longer within the 30 km. zone and their treatment and employment is in all respects in accordance with tfr orovisions of the Berne and Hagne Agreements.All complaints to the contrary emanating from England or France can be most firmly repudiated as unjustified.(Signed)     Hartog.From a cursory examination of the above report it would be inferred that the British and French prisoners were well lodged, never under shellfire, well fed, and in excellent health. The shortest answer is the medical evidence already referred to. But more careful examination made by a person with some knowledge of the facts does not invalidate the conclusion at which the Sub-Committee has arrived. i ,&quot; In view of the altered conditions prevailing under the &quot; 17th and 2nd Army the housing varies more and is in many &quot; cases not so good though ample throughout.&quot; It was in the 17th and 2nd Armies that the evidence shows very bad conditions.&quot; Provision has or will be made everywhere for sufficient wash-&quot; ing and latrine accommodation &quot; is delightfully naive. The report is dated just a month before the Armistice and this sentence is a valuable admission.&quot; In isolated instances requests for increased rations &quot; suggests that the prisoners were not as contented as General Hartog thought they ought to have been.&quot; In most instances the men were marched back to camp for &apos;&quot;&apos; dinner and work continued in the afternoon. In a few cases &quot; the work is not interrupted till 2 or 3 p.m., But then it concludes &quot; for the day.&quot; This is possibly true, but General Hartog either was not told, or forgot to mention, that in these cases the men had begun work at 5 or 6 a.m. and had marched some distance to work at which they had been kept without food, or even a stand-easy, for eight hours.&quot; The nature of the work varies very considerably except on &quot; the lines of communication the prisoners work, &amp;c.&quot; The shell dumps and rail heads where the prisoners had to handle ammunition were on the lines of communication.&quot;In the camps they have mostly to wear wooden shoes.&quot; General Hartog omits to state the reason, namely, that in many cases the&apos; Germans had taken the men&apos;s boots from them on the plea that they formed part of their military equipment.The paragraph headed &quot; health &quot; as also the conclusion, &quot; From &quot; the foregoing it is apparent the British in the places visited by &quot;me&quot; (it is perinissible to wonder how many places he visited) &quot; are to say the least sufficiently well housed and fed (sometimes &quot; even better), also that none are worked too hard or too long and &quot; that they are well treated,&quot; is, in view of the medical evidence, simply amazing.A. F. Peterson.18th February, 1920.
FIFTH AND FINAL EEPORT.The total number of British, prisonera-of-war repatriated from Bulgaria was 1,105, of whom about 450 were captured in 1918. The earliest captures were made in December, 1915. The Sub-Committee has considered all the complaints which have been made with reference to the treatment of British prisouers-of-war in Bulgaria, These complaints come under one or more of the following heads:  1. Food.2. Accommodation.3. Sanitation.4. Hard work,5. Punishment by flogging.Whilst the Sub-Committee does not doubt that ma ay of the British prisoners, both immediately after their capture and later, suffered very considerable hardships and discomforts, it is satisfied that these were due to the backward state of civilisation of Bulgaria rather than to intentional ill-treatment on the part of the Bulgarian Government or its officers. There is no com-plaint by any prisoner of exposure to shell-fire.1. Food.The evidence seems to show that the British prisoner received a similar ration to that allowed to the Bulgarian soldier, and the complaint of scarcity appears to be due to the fact that the Bulgarian soldier can subsist and work on a considerably smaller ration than that which the British soldier requires. In general the ration was larger than that which was provided in Germany, and it was supplemented by parcels. Having regard to the fact that the British prisoner was in the matter of food treated on the same basis as the Bulgarian soldier, the Sub-Committee has not seen its way to insist on the food ration as ground of complaint.2. Accommodation.Accommodation was sometimes very insufficient and the men were frequently overcrowded. But in this case also the Sub-Committee has considered that allowance must be made for the standard prevailing in Bulgaria. Examination has not shown that the accommodation of British prisoners-or-war was in general worse than that of the Bulgarian soldiers and peasants.3. Sanitation.Sanitation in Bulgaria is, as might be expected, in a some-what primitive stage and no doubt some of the methods adopted would not be viewed with favour in more advanced countries. But though the methods were simple, they were not ineffectual so far as the camps were concerned, whatever might be said by those who lived further down stream. Given the ^tage which the Bulgarians have reached in matters of sanitation, the Sub-Committee finds great difficulty in saying that the sanitary conditions in which the British prisoners-of-war were placed coulq support a charge of inhumanity,
4. Hard work.The prisoners-of-war no doubt had in some cases to work hard, but there is nothing to show that they were expected to work harder than Bulgarians who had a similar amount of food; and the evidence does not indicate that the prisoners were reduced to anything approaching the condition to which prisoners were reduced in Turkey, or behind the lines on the Western Front inFrance and the Eastern Front of Germany.     &quot;       &apos; &apos;&apos;        .   . ..   .\5. Punishment by flogging.There are many complaints of flogging. It is, however, to be remembered that flogging (called vicepot, meaning 25 strokes) i? a recognised method of punishment in the Bulgarian Army. Moreover, some of the witnesses state that this punishment was only inflicted in cases in which it was deserved, e.g., for drunken-ness, or for striking sentries or guards. It appears that Mr. D. I. Murphy, the American Consul-General, protested against this punishment being inflicted on British soldiers with the result that in their case it was discontinued.A considerable amount of liberty seems to have been accorded to British prisoners-of-war, and there is evidence of the kindness and friendliness of the Bulgarian civilians to the British prisoners. In some cases this freedom appears to have enabled the prisoners to purchase spirits, which led to unruly and riotous scenes at Philippopolis.There are few complaints of the hospitals and none on which action could be taken. The prisoners generally praise the treat-in ent which they received in hospital although in some cases it is said that medical supplies were defective. It is not to be denied that, on the whole, the Bulgarian hospital authorities did their best for the prisoners as well as for their own compatriots.The Sub-Committee gathers that the principal cause of suffer-ing to the British prisoners-of-war arose from malaria, con-tracted before they were captured, or in the prisoners-of-war camps or working camps. This disease, however, appears to be endemic in Bulgaria, and it is impossible to prosecute the Bulgarian authorities for inhumanity because the condition of Bulgaria is such as to foster malaria.On the whole the Bulgarian authorities, in the case of the British prisoners at least, were remarkably amenable to sugges-tions for improvements which the American Consular Autho-rities made, and seem to have prided themselves on the pre-f erential treatment which they granted to the British and French prisoners-of-war. Whatever may have been the treatment afforded to the Roumanians and Serbians, a subject which does not come within the scope of the Sub-Committee^ enquiry, it is only fair to remember that the Bulgarian authorities appear to have been anxious, so far as their means and their backward conditions permitted, to treat their British prisoners-of-^ar with consideration. It may be observed that they have published a number of letters by British soldiers testifying to the good treat-ment which the soldiers received in Bulgaria,
V 465Where the conditions were remediable substantial efforts were made to remedy them; and cases of ill-treatment seem to have been isolated and did not represent the general attitude of the Bulgarian Government and people to the British soldiers who had been taken prisoners.The number of statements which the Sub-Committee has con-sidered is about 302 relating to 61 camps and working camps and 24 hospitals and field hospitals. Having regard to the considerations set out above, and to the fact that many of the charges are not supported by sufficient evidence, the Sub-Com-mittee have only scheduled two persons for prosecution, namely, 2nd Lieut. Nicoloff, in respect to personal violence to British, prisoners-of-war at Philippopolis, and a man known as Phillip Waller for the inhuman treatment of British prisoners at the Alexandrovo and Bela working camps near Vidin.Having regard to the favourable impression which the bulk of the evidence has made on the Sub-Committee, it may be a matter for consideration whether any proceedings should be taken even in these two cases.This Sub-Committee first met on 8th November, 1918, and held its last meeting on 25th February, .1920. In all it has beld 64 meetings. It has considered the conditions under which prisoners-of-war have been detained in Germany, in the terri-tories occupied by the German forces, in the European and Asiatic Dominions of the Turkish Empire, and in Bulgaria. For this purpose it has examined:  (a) 3,572 statements of prisoners-of-war in Germany or Austria obtained before the Armistice by the Govern-ment Committee;(6) about 30,000 statements of prisoners repatriated from Germany since the Armistice&quot;, of which about 22,520 contain specific complaints of ill-treatment;(c) about 2,500 statements of prisoners repatriated from theEmpire of Turkey;(d) 302 statements of prisoners repatriated from Bulgariaof which about 130 contain specific complaints; and(e) over 1,000 reports and other documents, neutral, Germanand English dealing with the treatment of prisoners.It has also considered very fully the German Civil and Military Penal Codes. This Sub-Committee, moreover, has examined and made special reports on the cases of Captain Fryatt and Miss Cavell. The results of its work appear in five reports dated respectively: 18th December, 1918, 30th April, 1919, 4th February, 1920, 18th February, 1920, and 25th Feb-ruary, 1920.The Sub-Committee ventures to recommend that all the material placed before it and the documents recording its
decisions should, for the present, be lodged with the Government Committee on the Treatment by the Enemy of British rrisoners-of-War, for safe custody.The Sub-Committee also desires to place on record its appre-ciation of the important services rendered by Mr. E. A. Armstrong, and its sense of obligation to its Secretary, Mr. J. E. G. de Montmorency, who, by his industry, capacity and energy has so materially assisted the Sub-Committee in its protracted labours,A. E.

THIRD INTERIM REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE FOR OFFENCES IN THE AIR.Since the Second Interim Report, dated 3rd April, presented to the Main Committee on 6th May, 1919, your Sub-Committee have held four meetings, at which the remaining cases were fully and carefully investigated. In this investigation your Sub-Com-mittee followed the directions of the Main Committee upon the question of the illegality of indiscriminate bombardment.Tour Sub-Committee now present their Third Interim Report dealing with the airship raid of the 19th/20th October, 1917, by Airship L. 45, and the aeroplane raids of the 6th and 18th December, 1917.Tour Sub-Committee having carefully considered the airship raids of 31st March and 24th September, 1916, in both of which cases the crews were captured, came to the conclusion that the objective in each case might fairly be considered legitimate, and that therefore it was not desirable to take proceedings.Tour Sub-Committee also carefully considered the question of the responsibility of the German High Command in connection with airship and aeroplane raids and came to the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence upon which to formulate a charge of a breach of the laws and customs of war against the German High Command.Airship Raid on the 19th/20th October, 1917, by Airship L. 15.This airship, under the command of Kapt.-Leutnant Waldemar Kolle, formed one of a squadron, the Original destination of which was the industrial centre of England. The weather con-ditions, however, were such, on the night of the raid, that after rising to about 16,000 feet to avoid A.A. fire or aeroplane attacks they were caught in a heavy gale of wind from the N. and N.W., and L. 45 was carried to the S.E. and over London, and eventually crossed to France, and compelled to land there for want of fuel a short distance from a, town called Sisteron. The commander and crew were there taken prisoners and interned in the prisoners&apos; of war camp at iSisteron. It appears that L. 45, carried by the strong N.W. wind, reached the north-Western suburbs of London about 11.25 p.m. of the night of the 19th of October. It seems that the commander, from his observation of the numerous lights beneath him, con-cluded that his airship was passing over a big town, but does not appear to have known what town it was. The airship dropped two 50 Kg. bombs at Hendon, i.e., one in Collindeep Lane and the other in the new grounds of the Grahame-White Aerodrome, doing slight damage to several houses and cottages. It then dropped one 100 Kg. and one 50 Kg. bomb on the Midland Railway sidings south of Cricklewood Station, causing some damage to the track, telephone wires aild rolling stock, and injury-ing one man.   The airship continued its passage over London
at. a great height and dropped a 100 Kg. bomb, which fell in Piccadilly, opposite Swan &amp; Edgar&apos;s. This bomb damaged the roadway and several shop fronts and hilled five men (three^ of them soldiers) and two women and injured ten men (including two soldiers, a sailor and a police constable) and eight women. The airship passing south-eastward, next dropped a 300 Kg. bomb in Camberwell, which demolished three shops and more or less seriously damaged a large number of shops and houses, and killed two men (a sailor and a mechanic in the R.N.S.), four women and four children. Finally, the airship dropped another 300 Kg. bomb, which fell at Hither Green, Lewisham, destroy-ing three houses and damaging many others, and killing five women and nine children, and injuring two men, three women and two children. The airship, after passing south of the Mouth of the Medway, was attacked by one of our aeroplanes, but ultimately escaped across the Channel and came down in France as hereinbefore mentioned. The identity of this airship and the course it took before mentioned over London is established in great measure by wireless messages which were intercepted, and these gave information as to the name of the airship and the course it pursued. From answers given by some of the crew to questions put to them after they were taken prisoners, it would appear that they did not know what town they were bombing, and from the height at which the airship was flying, estimated at not less than 16,000 feet over London, it would seem that no particular objective was aimed at, nor, indeed, could have been distinguished under the circumstances. The attack was made and the bombs were dropped because from the lights which could be seen from the airship, it was apparent to the commander that his airship was passing over a large town. Looking at the whole of the circumstances, the Sub-Committee report that this appears to have been a case of indiscriminate bombing, and not a legiti-mate attack on a military objective; and in their opinion the commander should be detained and not repatriated, with a view to his subsequent trial for having committed acts contrary to the laws and usages of war and humanity.Aeroplane Raid of the 6th December, 1917.This raid was a night raid on a cloudless night, with good visibility. It was carried out by about 16 machines of the 3rd Bombengeschwader. The main objective appears to have been London, and having regard to the fact that of the bombs dropped the large majority were incendiary bombs of the new type and only a few H.E. bombs, it would seem that the inten-tion was to start conflagrations throughout the area attacked. On this raid 392 incendiary bombs were dropped and only 28 H.E. A large number of the incendiary bombs, about 280, fell on the City and the Metropolitan areas, killing 2 and injury-ing 7 persons, and doing a considerable amount of damage to property by fire and explosions. Five machines appear to have penetrated the defence of London. One of the five machines, as stated by a member of the crew, was hit by a London A.A.
gun., and ultimately obliged to come down at Flackington Marsh, near Canterbury. This machine had apparently released all its bombs before it was struck. The crew set fire to the machine and then gave themselves up to a local special constable. The names of the other members of the crew are Leutnant der Eeserve Paul Wilhelm Bernhard and Vizefeldwebel der Eeserve Bruno iSenf. Looking at all the circumstances of this raid, it would seem to be a fair inference to draw that the main intention was to start a widespread conflagration throughout the Metropolitan area by means of incendiary bombs, dropped indiscriminately. Your Sub-Committee submit that this raid comes within the ruling of the Main Committee of May 27th, 1919, and was a breach of the laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity, and recommend that proceedings against the airmen aforesaid be taken.Aeroplane Raid of the 18th December, 1917.This was also a night raid, and was carried out by about 17 machines of the 3rd Bombengeschwader, between 6 and 10 p.m. The machines were of a large type commonly known as &quot;Gothas.&quot;   -Of the machines which reached London, one, of a type known as &quot; Gotha IY.,&quot; was engaged and probably hit by Captain Murlis Green, and was seen by him to drop several bombs, viz., five 50 Kg. H.E. bombs in Bermondsey, at about 7.25 p.m. This machine attempted to cross&apos; the Channel but the remaining engine having failed, the pilot turned and attempted to reach the English coast again, and fell into the sea close to Folkestone. The crew consisting of Commander Stachelsky, Lieutenant Ketelson (since dead) and Lance-Corporal Wiesman were taken prisoners.The total number of bombs dropped over London in this raid were 15 12-Kg. H.E.; 26 50-Kg, H.E., and 1 300-Kg. H.E., and 47 incendiary bombs.The total casualties were, killed: 4 men, 4 women, and 3 children; injured: 32 men, 21 women, and 9 children.The area, over which the bombs were dropped extended from Aldersgate Street to Holborn, Yictoria, Eaton Square, Bermond-. sey, &amp;c.The Sub-Committee consider that this raid also falls within the ruling of the Main Committee of 27th May, 1917, and that proceedings against the airmen aforesaid be taken.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed)     HERBERT F,.

,&apos;Note. The reports on the raids of 6th and 18th December, 1917, were Originally presented to the Main Committee with a view to obtaining their opinion upon the question whether.the principle of law known as concerted action was applicable? viz., that where two or more persons combine to carry out an unlawful purpose, each isi liable for the act or acts of the other or others in carrying out the common purpose.After hearing a statement from Colonel de Watteville the Main Committee decided that as there was primd facie evidence to show that the occupants of each of the captured machines had taken a direct part in the indiscriminate bombardment of London, it was not necessary to consider or express an opinion upon the applicability of this principle of law to either of these cases.24th July, 1919.The following&apos; Memorandum was submitted to the Snb-Com-mittee at their meeting on 24th July, but no action was taken.Memorandum on &quot; Concerted Action.&quot;. When several persons take part in the execution of a common criminal purpose, each is a principal in the second degree in respect of every crime committed by any one of them in the execution of that purpose.The distinction between principals in the first and second degree is not of much importance as the liability of either is identical in criminal law.It is necessary to show that the crime of the principals or persons actually taking part in its commission was known to and assisted in by those who acted as accessories.A, B, C, D go out with a common, design and purpose to commit a crime A actually commits it, B. stands by ready to help A, C and D are stationed some way off to give the alarm if anyone comes. A, B, C, D are all equally guilty.of the crime. &quot; It was made a common cause with them, each man operated in his station at one and the same instant towards the same common end, and the part each man took tended to give countenance, encouragement, and protection to the whole gang and to ensure the success of their common enterprise.&quot;&quot;It is sufficient if, at the instant the facts were committed, they were of the same party and upon the same pursuit and under the same engagement of mutual support and defence with those who did the facts.&quot;ii, therefore, there be a &quot; common enterprise &quot; embarked upon to terrorise London and bomb it indiscriminately, inevitably thereby killing civilian men and women and destroying their property, there is a &quot; common criminal purpose,&quot; and the various sections of the raiders, and the several units composing those sections are mutually giving &quot; countenance, encouragement, and
protection to the whole gang.&quot; Indeed, it is obvious that the division of the raiders into sections is for the purpose of attack-ing as large an area as possible with a minimuni of risk from our defences, and the raiders must know this from the plan of attack and its adoption in previous raids.The height at which the raiders fly must show them the imprac-practicability of even attempting an attack on selected or legitimate targets. And one would suppose it is also obvious to the raiders that sub-division into sections and the more or less apparently independent action of each plane greatly facilitates the attack. The planned method of the raiders is not to let loose so many &quot; Gothas &quot; on London, each acting independently, but to so dispose the raiding force as the more effectively to carry out the concerted attack.The question of &quot;superior orders &quot; relieving the individual raiders from responsibility is a much more difficult one.The Sub-Committee have come to the conclusion that there is not sufficient evidence upon which to formulate a charge of a breach of the laws of war and humanity against the German High Command, nor is there any evidence that reports of a trustworthy character of the operations of any raid reached it. There is, I think, some indication that it was led to believe that legitimate objectives had been attacked in some raids at least. However, this may be, as regards the German High Com-mand, the particular officers in command of individual raids must either (a) have received orders to carry out a particular raid on certain legitimate objectives in London, in which case, in the raids selected by the Sub-Committee, such orders were not followed and mere indiscriminate bombing occurred under con-ditions, known to the raiders, which precluded any selection of legitimate targets, or (b) received orders merely to bomb London which those officers proceeded to carry out by indiscriminate attacks, or (c) they, of their own initiative, made indiscriminate attacks.The aeroplane raids, I believe, were all carried out by the 3rd Bombengeschwader with more or less the same personnel. Their equipment in maps and sights and the height and speed at which they flew made it impracticable by night to identify legitimate targets. In the first case mentioned above, the officers taking part in the raids must have known that what they in fact did was not in pursuance of orders they received, in which case &quot; superior orders &quot; would not protect them, and in the second case the orders were contrary to the laws of war and humanity and, according to the Memoranda on that subject by Professor Morgan and Sir F. Pollock (already printed in the reports before the Main Committee), ought not to protect them; and in the third case there were no orders, but the raids were carried out on their own initiative or, at the best, the raiders were &quot; left a free hand &quot; to attack London as and when they pleased.The position of subordinate N.C.Os. and others captured in raids of this unlawful character is more favourable than that of
the officers under wliose immediate command they were. It is possible that they were not aware of the true character of the raid on starting, but they must have been aware during its progress that the conditions under which it was carried out precluded any legitimate operations. It may not be necessary to further con-sider the position of N.C.Os. and subordinates, for although it would appear that to seek protection because of superior orders is a &quot; matter of defence,&quot; it is always more desirable to deal with persons of greater responsibility.It would seem, therefore, correct to say that the officers organis-ing and taking part in raids of this indiscriminate character are responsible, not only for what they individually do from the plane in which they are, but also as participators in a common enterprise of an unlawful character, and that the defence of &quot; superior orders &quot; would probably not avail them.(Signed)     A. H. BODKIN,24th July, 1919.
