Madras, no decision arrived at. Patna decided in favour of non-co-operation, but many members challenged decision. Lahore, non-co-operation carried by majority of votes. Bombay, approved. Bengal Committee has also passed resolution, moved by Bipin Chandra Pal, recording opinion that non-co-operation in sense of passive resistance is perfectly constitutional weapon in political struggle between people and Government,- and is only effective weapon left to former; that the practical working out of this principle should be left to each province; that as auxiliaries to non-co-operation campaign attempts should be made to establish arbitration courts and national education institutions, and to revive the Swadeshi and boycott movements, but that the boycott should not extend to the new legislative bodies which demand presence of members prepared to resort to non-co-operation within the Council. These represent extremist views, and generally disapproved by moderates. Mr. N. D. Metha has withdrawn his name from,Membership Reception Committee of special Congress iu view of adoption of non-co-operation resolution by Bengal Provincial Committee.2. Meantime Gandhi, touring in Madras, upholds non-co-operation as constitu-tional so long as without violence ; lias made appeal to lawyers to suspend practice and evolve law and order through institution of Panchayat courts. Appealed to people not to send boys to schools (which) were mere factories for manufacturing-clerks and Government servants; appealed to people not to seek election in Legislative Council and. boycott visit of Prince of Wales. Urged Mussulmans to stand single-handed and make it impossible for Congress to give any other verdict but in favour of non-co-operation. B. C. Pal, speaking in Calcutta before Provincial Congress Committee, referred to above two ways of obtaining national freedom : (1) revolution, which was impossible; (2) peaceful conciliation, equally impossible; non-co-operation only weapon left, by which he meant passive resistance; Did not support Gandhi&apos;s four stages, but two stages : (a) refusal to give social honour to title holders, and (6) complete reduction of social value of Government service.3. Approximately 30,000 Muhajarin migrated to Afghanistan, mainly from rural tracts of Peshawar district, but excitement spread to Bannu, Kohat and other districts. The orders from Afghanistan came at time (? when) feeling was beginning to run dangerously high, and to affect Government servants, including police. General tension appears to be slackening and position distinctly better. Zafar Ali, editor of Zamindar paper, Lahore, refused permission to enter North-West Frontier Province. Sincl leader advises no further migration for next two months owing to difficulties of journey and excessive heat. Central Khilafat Committee, Bombay, inter alia resolved, in spite of some opposition, that Eijrat movement be controlled and supervised by Central Khilafat Committee, for the purpose of which Hijrat Sub-Committee should be formed. Small numbers of Muhajarins are beginning to return from Afghanistan with graphic tales of hardships endured after passing Landi Kotal. They say that strong barrier has been erected across Khyber Pass to prevent . further unauthorised entry into Afghanistan, but delegation of Peshawar Khilafat Committee allowed to start for Jelalabad to confer with General Nadir Khan. General situation in Peshawar remains unchanged in matter of orderly conduct of the Muhajarin, but religious excitement continues. Situation otherwise quiet, though tone of vernacular Press continues unchanged. Non-co-operation movement and Hijrat movement gain little support Bengal, United Provinces, Delhi, Punjab, though Hijrat movement being energetically canvassed in Delhi and efforts made to despatch large party early in September. Hijrat movement, however, for time being broken by action of Afghanistan.Appointment of Tej Bahadur Sapru, Law Member, well received, Leader of Allahabad describing it as matter of special and particular satisfaction.   Lord Sinha&apos;s appointment severely criticised in Independent as destroying independence of Indian . Executive Council and applying policy of Akbar, but generally very well received by rest of Press, both English and Indian.Severe floods Midnapur causing immense damage, over 20 villages inundated, crops totally destroyed, relief measures in progress.
