This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET.18THE CABINET.KRASSIN AND KLISHKO.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I desire, on behalf of the War Office, to support in the most earnest manner the proposal made by Lord Curzon in his Cabinet Paper of the 16th instant, that the entire Bolshevik Delegation in this country should be invited to leave as speedily as possible. After what has happened, there is no doubt that the only use they will make of their stay here is to work us injury by every means that still remain open to them. There is no possibility of any exportation of grain from Russia for a long time to come. The South and the Ukraine are bitterly hostile to the Soviets, and grain can only be wrung from their peasants by processes of warfare which far exceed in their cost the value of the resultant booty. In proper Soviet Russia famine conditions of the utmost severity will continue to prevail. On the other hand, purchases by the Bolsheviks with the gold they have stolen from Roumania and otherwise violently acquired will be mainly used for the purpose of carrying on military operations. This is particularly true of locomotives and cloth for uniforms.As these military operations will very likely be a very great embarrassment to us, whether in Eastern Europe or against our Oriental possessions, we certainly should not encourage their continuance. For the rest, the only functions which will be open t$ Krassins Mission will be the following : (l.) To disseminate Bolshevik propaganda.(2.) To supply revolutionary elements in this country with money. (3.) To intrigue with the Council of Action at any moment of embarrassment or difficulty.(4.) To publish the Soviet side of any case in dispute between us and them.(5.) To collect any information of a military or political character which can be of use to the Bolshevik Government. (6.) To gain whatever prestige is possible for the Bolshevik Government throughthe presence of authorized representatives in England.Surely the time has now come for a two-fold announcement:  (A.) The dismissal of the Bolshevik Delegation, and(B.) An announcement that no blockade of Russia exists, and that any individuals may trade with Russia freely at their own risk.I would press most strongly upon my colleagues that these measures should be taken as soon as possible, but in any case before Parliament meets. We shall then have a clear and simple policy which can be easily explained and defended against attacks from any quarter.W. S. C.The War Office,21st, September, 1920.(B20/392)   100  9/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.  S561wo
