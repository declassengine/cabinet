Sfj^    i^irgnnlc Majesty&apos;o Govommenu &apos;      8 510 Downing Street, S.w., September 23, 1920.Robert Smillie, Ksq., J.?.Dear Mr, Smillie,On perusing tho report of yesterdayVs intorview I gather the impression that while tho ninere&apos; Bxocutive arc not averse in principle to, basing an increase of wages on output they have some difficulty in presenting to their delegates a proposal which is at present only in outline.Tho Government have great hesitation in attempting to make a detailed scheme for the reasons bo well stated by Mr. Smillie. --* that increased production depends not merely on the minors but on tho co-operation of the owners with those who work in the mines On this ground the Government wore end are of opinion that the only satisfactory method of yrooedure is for representatives of the owners and minors and the Coal Department to sit down together and work, out the details.     At the seme time, I recognise the anxiety of your delegates to know more than at present has been stated, and I add to what I said yesterday the following explana-tions of what is in the mind of the Government, J&quot;:There will be fixed certain datum lines on which rates of wages will be calculated in the following way.   If output reaches:x tons, wages will be inoreased by Is nor shiftx * y tons 2s per shiftx * y * z tons 3s per shift.If after increases have &quot;been obtained there are subsequent ammunitions of output tho increases will coma off.    It is ltaposs-ible for us now to say what figures would be represented by these letters.    These must obviously be arranged in conference botweon representatives of the owners, Diners, and the iiines Department, but I think it will be apparent, looking to recent figures of out put, that there is so much room for improvement th&amp;t tho miners oan make a certainty of increased pay.
To give the scheme a beginning the figures of output for October will be taken and any increase in output will be remunerated according to the arrangements set out above as from, lst October, payment being made retrospectively.

These, as you will understand, are only the general outlines of a scheme which might come into effect for the next quarter. There are many other factors which will require further determination for the purposes of a permanent scheme, but those can be adjusted by yourselves and the owners in consultation with the Mines Department.

The results of a coal strike would be so serious both for the minors themselves and the whole country that I am anxious to make sure that it will not occur on any misunderstanding, and if there is anything in this communication of which you desire an explanation the Government will be glad to give it.

Yours faithfully,

(signed) D. LLOYD GEORGE.
