His Bntxnruc I -i. ij 3^3 Government, . &apos; 9Circulated by the Secretary of State for InM&amp;QSECRET. U*AU-P-  - 8Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdaa^lv^ecretary of State for India,dated 21th August 1920.Situation is still deteriorating.   Inability of our armed forces, for reasons into which I need not enter, to obtain a striking military success at any point is encouraging our enemies and discouraging our friends.   Even most powerful friendly Sheikhs are slowly being forced by increasing strength of our enemies into hostilities against us.   Latest example of this is at Shatrah, where active preaching (of) Jehad by emissaries from Najaf and Kerbela, backed by letters of new chief Mujtahicl, has at last roused tribesmen to whom political catchwords had made no appeal.   Most important Sheikh in district, Khayun al Obaid, who owes none of his strength to us, but has since the armistice been a strong supporter of the Civil Administration, particularly during last two months, found himself unable to check rising spread of fanaticism amongst his tribesmen.   Town exhibited&apos; every outward sign of hostility against Assistant Political Officer and Levy Commandant, who was extricated at the last moment by Assistant Political Officer.   Capt. Thomas is personally popular amongst all classes (? and) competent, but this fact as at Qalat Sikar did not prevent growth of fanatical feeling, and only timely arrival of aeroplane saved either his life or that of Assistant Political Officer, Shatrah.   It is exceedingly difficult to predict probable developments.   The best we can hope is that when the season for sowing comes round in about six weeks&apos; time, tribesmen, who have now no special pre-occupation, will voluntarily return to their fields, and their chiefs be thus forced to come to some sort of settle-ment with us, but I do not consider it at all likely any military efforts we are likely to make will&apos;suffice to restore position just (? now).   Damage has been done to railway and Government buildings (corrupt group), towns have been looted and bazars burnt; our good name and all that word prestige stands for have, I fear, suffered irreparably.   Financially the Civil Administration has been ruined, and the country has received a set-back from which it will take years to recover.10  2189  100  8/20
