Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SEQ&amp;ET,I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to this telegram which I have received from the Government of India. I attach great importance to it, as it is a serious warning as to the growing feeling in India on the question of the supply of overseas garrisons from the Indian Army, and the conditions which may result therefrom.E. S. M.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 3rd September .1920.(Received 6th.)3rd September. Recent demands received by us for reinforcements for Mesopo-tamia on a large scale have forced us to consider whole question regarding supply of overseas garrisons from Indian Army.It would appear that His Majesty&apos;s Government is counting on India to provide a quota of the permanent garrisons of the mandatory territories in addition to certain colonial garrisons, including Aden, the Gulf ports and consular escorts in East Persia. We have received no direct intimation that His Majesty&apos;s Government desires us to undertake this liability; but have received an estimate which shows that, on present figures, this force will include, among other details, four cavalry regiments, one cavalry troop, 10 Sappers and Miners companies, 39^- Infantry and Pioneer battalions, one Signal troop and four Signal companies. It is possible this estimate is not final. We invite attention to the fact that we have not been consulted as to probable -political effect in India of accepting an engagement of this magnitude. It appears advisable to us, however, to warn you at once of our views on this aspect of the question.We have evidence to show that the great bulk of educated opinion in India is opposed to our undertaking extensive obligations in regard to overseas garrisons, and the subject has already attracted considerable attention in the Press and on the platform. The Turkish Peace Terms are universally unpopular, not only among Mohamedans, but among Hindus. Further, moderate opinion, including many Europeans, considers India is being exploited in being asked to provide for service outside India an unreasonably large proportion of troops now employed for Imperial purposes, since it is clear that no similar demand has been made on the Dominions, and that all British troops were demobilised as quickly as possible, with the inevitable result that, in case of trouble, the increased demands must be met from India and not from home.Attention is drawn to the fact that India is an original member of the League of Nations, but it is Great Britain and not India which has received a mandate for the new territories, and the troops employed are largely Indian. The general feeling above referred to naturally reinforces the movement among advanced Mohamedans on grounds peculiar to themselves against the despatch of troops to Mesopotamia and Palestine, while it is of course seized upon by extremist agitators, who are glad of any opportunity to embarrass us. We apprehend that this will react seriously on the general political situation, and effect morale of the army, and we do not think it will be possible to maintain position that India is to provide troops from the Indian Army for this purpose for any length of time. Again, it is difficult to convince India at large that charges for such troops are not borne by Indian revenues, and this adds to our difficulties in gaining acceptance for greatly increased charges for Military expenditure which forms part of our recent budget arrangements. Nor, indeed, are we ourselves able to contest the argument that obligation for maintaining overseas troops leads to considerable additional expenditure, since, apart from temporary difficulties as to demobilisation caused by knowledge that additional demands may be made on us at any moment, it is obviously not only that there are many items which we cannot definitely allocate, such as increased staff and inspection of (corrupt group) and accommodation, but the knowledge that considerable portion of the Indian Army may be called upon to spend long periods on overseas service will effect general rates of pay at which we can recruit the Indian Army.2255     100  9.z0 &apos;
We do not wish to represent that we have solar encountered any difficulty as regards reinforcements recently despatched to Mesopotamia, though we are aware that many regiments which have been serving overseas are feeling the strain due to lack of furlough, and the dangers of political and religious influence affecting the army are considerable. Our main apprehensions &quot;are, however, for the future, and we look with grave concern on what we hold to be the inevitable consequences, political and otherwise, (corrupt group) which will commit ourselves to supply overseas garrisons for a prolonged period.It must be realised that there are certain inherited traditions connected with peace service in the Indian Army which have become to be regarded as a right, such as the grant of liberal leave and furlough for harvesting, for the purposes of marriage, or for other domestic reasons. Such considerations are incompatible with prolonged service overseas.Again, although the men themselves may raise no objection to overseas service, the women-folk are put to great inconvenience and frequently to hardship, through the absence of their men-kind, and consequently growing discontented, a state of things of which the agitator is not slow to take advantage, but one&apos; which we are practically powerless to remedy, and we trust you will impress on Cabinet Council the importance of recognising these factors.In our special Despatch No. 2, we stated definitely that Government of India could not accept an obligation to supply permanent overseas garrisons to mandatory territories, and we now desire definitely to emphasise that position, and. ask that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take our views on the subject into consideration. His Majesty&apos;s Government can rely on. our doing our best to endeavour to enlist men in India on their behalf for local forces maintained in Alesopotamia or elsewhere, but we do not consider the Indian Arm)&apos; should be required to provide large overseas forces, and we shall be glad to receive some definite statement of the policy of His Majostys Government in this matter. *In the present condition of affairs, particularly in Mesopotamia, we shall, of course, make every effort to do our best to meet emergent demands for reinforcements as they arise, though we recognise the danger of this course, but we look to His Majesty&apos;s Government to return Indian units to us as speedily as the situation permits. As regards reinforcements now being sent, we propose, with your concurrence, to make a public announcement that, owing to the spread of serious disorder in Mesopo-tamia, Government have been compelled to declare that a state of war exists in that area, and intends to use all resources at its disposal to put an end to this state, and to protect British and Indian subjects on service in the country. This will constitute service in Mesopotamia as active, and give us the requisite power to deal with any inconvenient incidents which arise.
