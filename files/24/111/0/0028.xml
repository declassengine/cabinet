riHIS DCCUMMT IS       PROPERTY., OF. HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GCVBRNMMT. ] JET. COPY HO. ^_Prioe^pf &quot;British Wheat,. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The situation with regard to the produotion of Home-grown wheat has &quot;become so critical that I feel hound to &quot;bring it before the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency, and to press for a very early decision.The annual Agricultural Returns (giving the position as on June. 4th) reveal a further heavy shrinkage in the area under wheat, amounting to 344,000 acres in ;3ngland and Wales alone.    This, coming on the top of the reduction announced last year (335,000 acres) shows a total loss   since 1918 of practically the whole of the - additional wheat production which was gained during, the war.    Hor is there any sign of this movement &quot;being arrested, and the disintegration-clination of farmers to grow wheat is becoming more and more marked. There are various/contributory causes (notably labour troubles) which are influencing the farmer to convert his arable into pasture, but, apart from these, there is a special discouragement with regard to growing wheat, owing to the maintenance &quot;by the Government of a control of price which the farmer regards as discriminatory and unfair.     In short, wheat is now the only cereal for which the produoer is not permitted to receive the market price;   the profit at the controlled price is very small, and in consequence (as the Returns show) he prefers to grow barley instead.It is not in the national interest that this process should continue and, if it is to be arrested, a decision must be come to without delay as the sowing season is olose at hand.    The position has been rendered more difficult by the recent decision of the Cabinet (C.47 (20) Minute 6) that the bread subsidy should terminate by March 31st, 1921, as this raises in an acute form the question of the price to be paid for British wheat now being harvested.
The latest decision was that which the prime Ministerannounced in the House of Commons on March 12th last:-wSo lonff as wheat is still controlled and thereby deprived of a free Jtjarket the controlled price of Holne-lfroval wheat&quot; of ffbund milling quality harvested in 1920 shall be the monthly average (c.i.f.) price of imported wheat cf similar or comparable quality, pra^idjd^that the price so paid to the^J? ome^grower^ shall_not exceed *   &quot;^T&quot; per quarter of feet&quot;lbs&quot;&apos;X&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;When this announcement was made it was expected that the &quot;bread subsidy would remain in operation throughout the cereal year 1920-21, but the situation has been entirely altered by the termination of the bread subsidy before the end of the cereal year.So long as the bread subsidy continued it was possible to justify the payment to the British farmer of a price.which was lower than the world price, on the ground that it reduced the amount of the bread subsidy, and it was practicable to administer the arrangement by means af the control of the flour mills.If, however, the. bread subsidy is removed it would be impossible to justify the payment to the British farmer of a lower price than that paid by the miller for imported wheat.     The farmers will reasonably contend that the maximum price of 95/- was contingent on the maintenance of control and that the abolition of the bread subsidy is in effect the removal of control and should entitle them to the benefit of a free market.After control comes to an end it would be administratively impossible to enforce a maximum price for British wheat, and politically impossible to compel farmers&apos; to sell their wheat to millers at 95/- at the same time as the millers had to pay (say) 130/- for imported wheat.It seems clear, therefore, that it would onot only be unjustifiable, but impracticable, to maintain the restriction of a
maximum price of $5/- after March 31st next.    Apart from these Jconsiderations, I would urge, aa a matter of agricultural policy and in the national interest, that the maximum price should be dropped at once, and for the following reasons -(1)    A continued restriction of price until March,.1921, would undoubtedly lead to hoarding on a very extensive scale.-  It . would be perfectly possible for the great majority of.farmers to ; defer selling any wheat at all till after Maroh, 1921, and the   &apos; fact that they would.then get at least  1 a quarter more would be such a powerful inducement that there is no doubt most af them would act upon it.    The result would be that the wheat Commission would have to purchase a correspondingly larger quantity of,foreign wheat in the early part of the cereal year, when the price will,:probably be higher than will be the case later on. . ..   -(2)    Apart from this, an immediate announcement, cf the removal of the present maximum price of 95/- would be the most potent induce-ment:to farmers to increase their wheat acreage this autumn, and indeed I am convinced it is the only method by which suoh an increase can now be secured.    In selecting the orops he will, grow the farmer is influenced far more by the actual prices at the time .of sowing than by the probable prices at harvest, and he has been so mystified and exasperated by the^various and shifting announcements, as to wheat prices, that nothing but the immediate receipt of a price that he regards as fair, compared with the prices obtainable.for alterna-tive crops, will give him any confidence to increase his wheat acreage.    His attitude a,t present may be expressed as follows if&apos;&quot;The Government know that the price Of wheat in 192021 will be high, so they impose a maximum price to prevent me from obtaining the full benefit.    Hext year they hope prices&apos; will have fallen, so they tell me I can have the world, price after next harvest *    X am not being treated fairly and,. instead of growing Wheat, I will lay my land to grass, or grow barley or some other crop which is uncontrolled&quot;.If the cone ess ion for which I ask, and which, I under-stand, is strongly backed by the wheat Commission, is not made now,
I have little doubt faatf circumstances/ and Parliamentary pressure, will force our hands within the next three months, by which time it will be too late to influence the autumn sowings and the Government will get no credit tot its action. On the other hand, if an announcement is made now, it may, to a large extent, retrieve the situation.I, therefore, most strpngly urge the Cabinet to sanction an immediate announcement that the maximum price of 95/- is cancelled, and that till the termination of the &quot;bread subsidy the farmer should receive a price on a parity with the prices charged to millers for imported wheat.    On and after the date when the bread subsidy terminates they would., of course, get the economic price in a free market.L of p.31st August, 1920.
