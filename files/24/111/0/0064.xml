CONFIDENTIALMemorandum by the First OominiBaioner of Worlio Proposed removal of off ice a of the Wheat Commission,The proposal that the Royal Commission on Wheat ^Supplies should be removed from their present quarters arises from the fact that they occupy expensive requisitioned buildings which are urgently required by important business firms.,   Their present quarters consist of Waterloo House, haymarket, Greener House, Kaymarket, and the major portion of Trafalgar House, Waterloo Place,   These buildings by reason of their situation, command rentals which are greatly in excels of their real value for Governmant purposes and considerable economy could be effected by the removal of the Wheat Commission-   I wish to point out most strongly that the retention of requisitioned premises can only now be justified in cases of absolute necessity and where it is impossible to provide alternative accommodation-   Because we were enabled during, the War to requisition premises for Government purposes it appears to me to be commonly assumed by Departments in possession of such premises that their purely Departmental convenience is sufficient ground to entitle them to remain in these premises, A large portion of the present accommodation has been taken by important business concerns at considerably higher rents than the Government are paying, and I am not clear whether the Government may not be compelled, if these premises are retained, to pay the higher rentals.     At a time when the one charge against the Government is the unnecessary expenditure of public money and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is continually appealing for economy among all sections of the community it issurelyCABINET.
surely both politically and financially exceedingly unwise, without very much stronger reasons than are advanced in Lord Crawford!e memorandum to retain unnecessarily, even for another six months, some of the most expensive office accommodation in London, the occupation of which by a Government Department is so prominently striking.   It is this kind of thing which sets the business community so much against the Government.,It was never intended that the whole staff should be removed to premises in Cromwell Road (close to the South Kensington District Railway Station) but only the Flour willIs Control and Finance Staffs.   The Administrative Staff are to go to Palace Chambers where space can be made available by concentrating the ministry of Food Headquarters Staff within the buildingo   This arrangement had received the informal approval of the Food Ministry.   Nor was it ever intended that the removal should take place until the present Industrial crisis is over.   I cannot, however, agree to defer the arrangements until the 31st March next.   If no strike takes place, the buildings now occupied by the Wheat Commission should be vacated on&apos;.the 31st proximo..Lord Crawford&apos;s objections, based on the dislocation which&apos;1 would result from the removal, are) I consider, exaggerated even were the Commission to be removed as a whole to Kensington, but they are quite unfounded as regards the effect of a removal of his Administrative Staff to Palace Chambers.   The building is in fact, contiguous to the Westminster Station on the District Railway and-almost every train steps at South Kensington Station.   The communication between the latter building and Cromwell.Road is, therefore, extremely good.
I am quite unable to appreciate the relevance of the references to the turnover and to the working costs of the Royal Commission.   Having regard to the magnitude of the individual transactions and to the large proportion of Unsalaried officials, the ratio of costs to sales.ought, I should imagine, to be very low indeed.   Nor can I follow the allusion to the possible loss in interest to the exchequer consequent on increased mileage.In many of its features this present case recalls that of zhe doy&amp;I Commission on Sugar Supplies last year in which I had the support of the Cabinet.     Similar unfounded and irrelevant objections were raised and there was the same unwillingness to co-operate with by Department in that case, but, as will be remembered, the Cabinet decided that the removal should take, place which was. accordingly., effected., so far as I can judge, without loss In any way.-I have been endeavouring to find alternative accommodation for the Wheat Commission f,or.many months, and had found premises in Clements Inn which would have been more convenient from the point of view of accessibility to the City and would have more than met Lord Crawford&apos;s %point regarding extra mileage.     These premises, however, were not acceptable to the Wheat Commission and my staff have been to considerable trouble to find alternative accommodation.     I feel bound to point out to the Cabinet that there is considerable loss of revenue and a great deal of work carried out quite unnecessarily by my Department owing to the unwillingness of Departments, such as in this instance, to recognise that the Office of Works is alone able to provide Government accommodation and to decide whether it is adequate,for the work involved.   I have alwayshesitated
hesitated to trouble the Cabinet with Departmental matters of this character; but I would strongly urge that the Cabinet should make it clear that the decision of my Department; with the concurrence of the Treasury, as has been obtained in the present case, should be final in these matters.ALFRED MONDo . 17th September, 1920,
