It is quietest district in Mesopotamia, and no district is better administered. There is more real co-operation by people in all branches of work of Government than in any other Division, partly because the district is shut off from Mesopotamia and administered largely independently on simpler lines of interference than is possible in Mesopotamia, and partly owing to the willing spirit of co-operation of the people. Provided the district is not thrown into disorder, as is always possible by incursions from Persia, and provided the increasing grave disturbances in Arbil Division do not affect it (?). I hope that evacuation may not be necessary, as I have no doubt that Government is popular and that 99 per cent, of people wish for no change. In this district, as elsewhere, there is a steady stream of propaganda from Baghdad and Kirkuk, the object of which is to break up present arrangements and produce anarchists. There is clearly no desire on the part of the people to be connected with any such conception as an Arab State ; equally there is no desire that they should be connected with any larger unit (? far from) Sulaimaniyah itself. The longer things can remain in their present indeterminate condition the better.2273-2    100    9i0
