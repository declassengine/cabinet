The real danger is the very rapid growth of revolutionary feeling that has followed the establishment of the &quot;Council of Action&quot;.   Sven the steadier men appear to be interested and, so far, no opposition has been reported.   Revolutionaries are making the most of their opportunity and, in the words of one of my correspondents, &quot;the spirit of revolt grows every day, especially in the engineering trades and among miners and railwaymen.&quot;Next in importance is the growing unemployment of ex-Service men. I3ven the better class of these are becoming embittered and * are inflammable material for Ike agitator to work upon.With the present available evidence the chances of a coal strike may be estimated at about 75 per cent.   It is, of course, possible that at the last moment the &quot;Council of Action&quot; will be invoked to act as mediator on a carefully stage-managed plan, but even so, it is probable that there will be a sectional strike in South Wales.   The other Unions are alarmed at the prospect of their funds being depleted if the strike became general.   The miners may strike earlier than the 20th September without giving the usual notice.If the lock-out of electricians takes place there will be /dislocation of the engineering industry.Unless the shopmen1s grievances are settled there may be serious trouble with the railwaymen.The/
The movement for a &quot;One Big Union&quot; of the various       $ Unions concerned in shipping, of which Mr. ISrnest Bevin is said to be t,he promoter&quot;, may become an important factor in the Labour movement.Renaudel, the French Socialist, has been granted a visa for England.Though the public does not appear to,,be much concerned, the Government has a &quot;bad Press&quot; on the question of releasing the Lord Mayor of Cork.,   Special precautions are being taken in view of the possibility of reprisals, which have been threatened.There has been a t?*.d week in Ireland.   Sine Officers and men of the Royal Irish Constabulary were murdered during the week and there was an increase in the number of.outrages, The Sinn Peiners&quot;are in possession of a number of secret documents captured, apparently, in the raids on mail vans.Mi
THE &quot;COUNCIL Off ACTION&quot;In response to the recommendation of the National Council of Action &quot;Peace&quot; demonstrations were held all osrer the country on Sunday and record attendances are reported. Practically all the leaders of the Labour movement addressed meetings, but the speeches were stereotyped and singularly devoid of new features.The attendance at Trafalgar Square was estimated at 15,000, but many of these people were passers by.   Mr. Lansbury received an ovation, the cheers lasting for three minutes.   There is no doubt that his popularity with the extreme section has greatly increased during the month.$he resolution put at all the meetings expressed &quot;unqualified approval&quot; of the resolution adopted by the Labour Conference of August 13th end pledged support to the national Council in &quot;whatever steps it deems necessary&quot; to secure the demands there put forward.At Clapham a continuous meeting was held from 3 p.m. to 8.45 p.m., apparently with the object of collecting funds. The audience varied from 30 to 500 people. here is no doubt that the propaganda of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has done much to foster pro-Bolshevik sympathy among the workers.   The Russian delegation, encouraged possibly by its success in this country, seems likely to devote attention to Prance.   Muller, kamenoffs Press agent, has had an interview with the Radio Press Agency and was anxious to give the impression that Soviet Russia will recognise Russia&apos;s foreign debts.The response to the call for the formation of local councils has been considerable and hundreds are already in -   existence.   In spite of the fact that the nucleus is almost invariably a local Trades and Labour Council, there is evidence that the Trade Unions, especially key industries, are wellrepresented/
represented.   &quot;Divisional Councils&quot; are in process of formation and may beoome an important,.-link in the Soviet system.The movement calls for very serious.consideration, for just as the formation of the National Council united, for the first time, Left and Bight leaders, so the local councils are permeating that great mass of the wrkers which is usually apathetic.   My correspondents report that audiences grow &quot;bigger almost daily and that there is no opposition.   Meeting! usually close with the singing of &quot;The Red Flag&quot;, &quot;Bolshevism is openly advocated and enormous quantities of extremist literature are distributed.   In the Glasgow district alone nearly one million leaflets and pamphlets were circulated during the last week-end.   The steadier branch officials are forced to follow in the steps of the moderate leaders, and in cases where they do not recant their former professions their position is becoming untenable.Speeches are wilder and there is adverse comment from the middle classes on the licence allowed to orators. The workers on the other hand, seem ready to believe anything.TH3 OPAL MINSKS &quot;- &quot;The ballot is.now being taken in the various coalfields and it is believed that the majority necessary to declare a strike will be obtained.   The leaders&apos; utterances are bellicose in the extreme, but,there seems to be a feeling among the men that the Government will compromise.   In South Wales they say, &quot;We are certain to get a shilling out of it anyhow?&quot;   It must not, however, be assumed, that.this feeling will prevent,.them from^striking for they will certainly follofl their leaders.   It is becoming increasingly clear that the motive of tn$ wire-pullers has no relation to wages as such,but/
tout is merely the intention to bring about the socialisation of the industry.Neither railwaymen nor transport workers are likely to support the miners officially until they see which waf the strike is going, although sections, especially in Wales, will doubtless refuse to handle coal.There are signs that other unions are seriously perturbed by the prospect of a miners&apos; strike and a strong body of opinion favours discussion of the dispute at the forthcoming Trades Union Congress.The unemployment which would be the outcome of the strike would seriously deplete the funds of other unions and would probably prove a serious menace to Trades Unionism as a whole.   It is this knowledge, and not any desire for the stability of the country, which is influencing the would-be mediators.   On the whole, it seems likely that the Triple Alliance will approach the Government when the result of the ballot is known.   It is quite clear that any concessions would be a signal for renewed demands from other industries.A new, but scarcely unforeseen complication has arisen in the demand of the colliery firemen, examiners and deputies for the 2s. increase claimed by the operative miners.TBS EM0IHJB3BIMG industry the position in the engineering industry is most unsettled. Apart from the grave discontent with the decision of the Industrial Court, to which I have referred in previous reports, a crisis is threatened as a result of the Penistone dispute. The employers maintain that a vital principle is at stake and threaten to issue lockout notices to all members of the Slectrioal Trades Union, to become effective as from September 4th.   The Executive of the Union met the branch secretaries in conference at Manchester on August 24th, and it was subsequently/
subsequently announced that arrangements are being made to meet the lockout.   On the same day a conference of the Executive Council of the National federation of General Workers and representatives of all the Unions affiliated to the Federation appointed a Negotiation Committee to discuss the matter with the Electrical trades Union, the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Iron and Steel trades Confederation. There is no doubt that strong efforts will be made by the Unions, whose members would be affected by a lockout of electricians, to effect a settlement.   As, however, the principals in the dispute seem adamant the prospect of a general stoppage in the engineering industry cannot be ruled out.   In Yorkshire and Lancashire there is said to be a good deal of support for the electricians from other workers.The engineers&apos; embargo on overtime in Lancashire is causing increasing inconvenience arid stoppages resulting therefrom are becoming more frequent.   It is reported that the Parting ton Steel arid Iron Co., Manch ester, which employs over 5,000 men and boys, intends to close down its extension -on the Ship Canal at Irlam, unless the embargo is removed. Other firms which employ jointly some 30,000 men and boys are said to be contemplating a similar measure.   In spite of these threatened discharges the feeling among engineers in this district is running so strongly that my correspondent predicts an unofficial strike if the leaders do not take up the question of increased wages.   Another correspondent thinks that the men would accept an increase of 3d.   The root of the troubleseems to be the high wages of the dockers, who in some cases are receiving more then skilled engineers.Unemployment in the Coventry district is increasing at the rate of some 150 men weekly and the total number of engineers/
57engineers now unemployed is about 1,300.   Twenty-five per oont of the employees at Messrs. Hubert&apos;s Engineering Works, 3dgwick, have now been dismissed.   A good deal of short time is being worked.   It is alleged that apart from the difficulty in obtaining steel plates and castings, the sales of heavy motor lorries by the Disposal Board has had a detrimental effect on the Coventry industry.   The local officials are urging that the condition of the industry justifies the demand for a 44 or even a 40 hour week.On August 21st about 800 were paid off from the locomotive department of Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth and Co., Scotswood works, Newcastle.   The rank and file in this, district show a certain willingness to work on payment-by-results but are held back by their officials.TBB CO-OPERATIYJiS SOCBTISS AND LABOUR.Beferenctf has been made in previous reports to the arrangements existing, or contemplated, between co-operative societies and trade unions.   My Coventry correspondent has now obtained first hand information from a leader of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative employees.   This official states that the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain has already paid a large sum of money into the Co-operative Wholesale Society and that in the event of a strike each miner&apos;s family will be able to obtain groceries, on credit, to the value of  1 weekly, from the locai co-operative societies.   The coupons will then be sent to the Co-operative Wholesale Society headquarters at Manchester who will be responsible for reimbursement.   The Moulders&apos; Union is still paying money to the Coventry Co-operative Society for goods obtained during the strike, and many moulders are stillobtaining/
obtaining supplies on the oredit system.   The local society is straining every nerve to increase stocks and capital.   The branches have been called upon to furnish returns of their stocks to headquarters.My correspondent states that the miners in this area are convinced that they will obtain food-stuffs on credit if they strike; they were, however, much perturbed by the lightning strike of co-operative employees at Bedworth on August 10th and expressed doubt as to the ability of the society to carry out the working arrangement, should the miners&apos; strike materialise.The South VJales I*inersT Federation has invested  175,711. 19. Ed, or considerably more than one-third of its total funds in the Co-operative Wholesale Bank and the lodges now have under consideration the printing of credit vouchers drawn on the local co-operative societies. They are, however, apprehensive that tickets will be forged and that they will be forced to honour a number greatly in excess of the official issue.On August 21st a &quot;Left Wing&quot; Co-operative Conference at Derby was attended by about  130 &quot;delegates&quot;.   A resolutio attacking the policy of the Directors was adopted for reference to the branches,Determined efforts are being: made by extremists to capture the Co-operative committees in order to effect the fusion of the movement with labour.   An example of minority influence has ,just occurred at Nottingham, where there are about 18,000 co-operators.   At the request of any 50 members, a special members&apos; meeting can be convened and this number of socialists accordingly summoned a . meeting to discuss affiliation with the Labour movement. The meeting was announced by means of notices posted inthe/
the co-operative stores and 70 members attended, including the 50 conveners.   An affirmative resolution was passed and the 18,000 members of the Nottingham Co-operative Society are now pledged to support the fusion.Propaganda is needed to shake the apathy of the ordinary co-operators.gBELIKG mm EX-SERVICE MENThere has been some activity among members of the International Union of Six-Service Hob during the week. On August 8th, John Steele, a Bolshevist and a former sub-editor of &quot;The.Socialist&quot;, was arrested for insulting language in Hyde Park and was charged at Marlborough Street Polioo Court on August 20th.   A hostile demonstration of - about 400 members of the Shepherd&apos;s Bush branch of the Union was then addressed by George Turner, who stated that if Steele were convicted and sent to prison, revolversand hand grenades would be used to secure his release. A fine of 40s. and 203 costs was imposed on Steele and the *&apos; speakers then appealed for money from the crowd to save &quot;bloodshed&quot;.On August 24th George Turner was arrested on a warrant from $he,Director of Public Prosecutions for inciting others to..commit crime and misdemeanours in speeches made &apos; on August 16.th..   &apos;Unrest among ex-Service men seems.to be increasing, as are their demands that work shall&apos;-be found for them. /     In London there is enthusiastic support for a demand for increased tensions.       their present temper, these men are.an easy prey for agitators and my correspondents lay particular stress on their attitude.-They are all beginning to believe the speakers who tell them that theGovernment/
M*     Q     **Government ia keeping them unemployed in order that they may be forced back into the army.   Ex-Service men in ^Newcastle stated on August 21st that they had received calling up notices.A correspondent states that many unemployed at Liverpool Docks are ex-soldiers, who, with the exception of an occasional job there, have been out of work since demobiliB&amp;* tion.   One man said that he had made daily application for work at the Docks but had not been successful in obtaining a job of any kind for the last six weeks.   He added that there were many more ex-Service men like himself who were not now eligible for the unemployment ^rant, and were therefore almos destitute and complained bitterly of this treatment. Referring to the &quot;Council of Action&quot; now in conference in London, he said that instead of wasting energy in opposing the proposed war against Russia, the Council should take up the cause of the discharged soldiers and force the Government J to fulfil its obligations to these men.   He thought that a   j campaign against Russia would be a complete fiasco in any    j oase without the intervention of the Council, because in consideration of the shabby treatment they had received, ex-; Service men would refuse to re-join the colours.&quot;NO RIOT&quot; STRIKEMy correspondent sends the following report&quot;The rent strike protest passed off without untoward incident.   The demonstration convened by the Scottish Labour Housing Association to protest against increased rents took place on Plesher&apos;s Haugh, Glasgow Green, on August 23rd.   Several thousands of people met at the appointed rendezvous and marohed in procession to the Green.&quot;At 6 platforms arguments against the rent increase were made by numerous agitators, who advised their audiences to r**use to pay.   In some cases the speeches were quite but in others the revolutionaries     (made full use of their opportunity. John McLean and J Captain J. R. flhlte forgot the rent question in their 1zeal/   1
532eel for communism and the dictatorship of the proletariat.   They invited, their hearers to enrol in the three divisions of the &apos;Workers&apos; Army&apos;: ex-soldiers, the lighting&apos; miners of Lanarkshire (Irishmen) and the Sinn fein movement in Scotland. White asked for recruits for the &apos; Red Army of scotland, and congratulated the demonstrators on their fine soldierly hearing.   These were of the lowest class and were in various stages of intoxication.   He had charge of about 500 ex-Service men and Sinn Seiners, whom he marched through the streets and afterwards put through their paces on the Green.   Be was assisted by Patrick Quinlan, the Australian-Irish ex-soldier; three companies of Sinn Fein Volunteers and one company of the&apos;Irish Citizen Army were present; the latter were said to be armed with revolvers.   Thanks to the Press oampaign led by the Glasgow &apos;Daily Record1, which attacked the agitators, the demonstration was a failure.&quot;The only success the local revolutionaries can claim is that they effectually held up the industrial machine for 24 hours.   A large number of workmen struck owing to intimidation, arid spent the day as. a holiday.   About 12,000 persons marched in procession, and this number was not greatly exceeded on the Green, in spite of the fact that the working population of Glasgow is over 6OO;0OO.&quot;A awnber of small incidents occurred but generally speaking the day passed off quietly.   Stone throwing was indulged in by pickets at Singer&apos;s factory, Clydebank, several persons being injured, including police officers.   A press photographer was also knocked about and his camera damaged.The tram servioe was stopped.&quot; .THE COMMUNIST PARTY OP GREAT BRITAIN 1E1D 1PHB 1 COUNCIL OP ACTION&apos;The current issue of T,The Communist&quot; contains an interesting article by Arthur McManus on the attitudeof the party, of which he is ohairman, to the 1 Council ofAction&apos;.   He writes:-&quot;Both the composition of the Congress itself and its infant &apos;Counoil of Action1 are without precedent in the history of the Labour movement, and, taken in conjunction with the oircumstance. which called them both into being, constitute a situation which must be examined and judged on its merits of revolutionary possibility..,&quot;To decide to strike against war, or the threat of war, dismisses once and for all any further question as to the validity of Industrial or Direct Action for politioal purposes, and relegates the bones of that skeleton in Labour&apos;s outboard to the political crematorium.Again/
&quot;Again, the granting of power to the 1 Council of Action&apos; to summon a strike immediately, should such he necessary, is not only as J. H. Thomas put    ^ it: &apos;A challenge to all constitutional institutions,&apos;y but, however little he may have dreamt it, it is a challenge to the constitutionalism of Labour itself. The unwarrantable insistence of a constitutional ballot before any industrial action could be adopted, which has in the past been well-nigh the strongest weapon in the armoury of capitalism, is, let us sincerely hope, also a thing of the past...&quot;Official Labour can rest assured of our support in this crisis, because the Communist Party is to the Republic of Russia flesh of its flesh and bone of its bone.&quot;The dissension within the party grows apace and a Scottish delegate is now suggesting yet another conference, this time of Scottish Communists, who are opposed to affiliation with the Labour Party.The sales of &quot;The Communist&quot; are not as large as those of &quot;The Call&quot;; it is suggested that this fact may be due to the change of name.RADEg AND BRITISH KBVOLUTIONARIBgIn his article &quot;Moscow and London&quot; printed in &quot;The Worker&quot; of August 21st Karl Radek preaches revolution in this country.  He makes the usual attack upon the &quot;SecondInternational&apos;1 as &quot;an instrument of counter-revolution&quot; and upon our Labour leaders as traitors to the working-class &quot;Moscow,&quot; he says, &quot;is an emblem of the New World of Labour bom into the light of day in terrible pain and London is the emblem of the world of exploiters and Capitalists collapsing in utter decay of rottenness and filth.&quot;MISS SYLVIA PANKHUR3T AND TEBOLORSi) ROTHSTBINOn September 25th and 26th Miss Pankhursfs Communist Party will hold a &quot;National Inaugural Conference&quot; at Manchester.   This conference will have power to: Choose a new name for the Party;, Choose/
Choose a new Secretary for the Party;Choose a new Party organ;Sstablish its own system for control of the Party and the Party Organ;Decide where the head office snail be;Alter the rates of contribution; in a word, to do everything to found a thoroughly representative Party,of British Revolutionary Communists on tho basis of the seven main principles laid down at the Preliminary Conference,It is reported that Rothstein1s recall to Moscow is connected with Miss PankhursVs presence in that city.   She claims that Rothstein has appropriated for his personal use money&quot;given him for propaganda and that he has mismanaged propaganda in this country, Orders have been issued that Rothstein shall be refused leave to land if he should return to this country.ROY BORfllMAN , , 4Roy Rorniman, who is connected with Indian agitators in this country and is frequently in the company of Abdul Kasero and SyedHossain, has interviewed Krassin at the suggestion of George Lansbury.SPIN FEIN gj GR&amp;AT BRITAIHThe agitation about Dr. Mannix continues but it is growing a little half-hearted,   A Monster Demonstration is being arranged in Glasgow in the hopes that Dr. Mannix will attend it.   &apos; -  - :The Mannix; case is overshadowed by the case of the lord Mayor of Cork;   Though fourteen Labour leaders have signed an appeal for hie release and the Press, with few exceptions, are against allowing him to die in prison, the case is attracting very little interest among the rank and file of Labour.   There is to be&apos;a &quot;Hands offIreland ;7
Ireland&quot; Demonstration in Southward P&amp;rk on September 12tb. IVarious threats are being made about reprisals on highly placed personages in iSntdand if the Lord Mayor of Cork dies in prison.   This is a familiar device for intimidating the Government, but special precautions are &apos; being taken in view of the danger of action by some ill-balanced fanatic.During the past week the campaign against the police was intensified.   9 officers and men of the Royal Irish Constabulary were murdered.   The number of outrages reports by the,police amounted to 283. an increase of 73; of this number 234 were directly attributable to Sinn Fein, only 7 wore of an agrarian nature and the remaining 42 were due to the prevalent state of lawlessness.   The efforts\of Sinn l*oin are chiefly concentrated on wrecking the Royal Irish Constabulary.   In no instance had the police a chance to defend themselves.   The wide distribution of the scenes of these crimes indicates that orders have been received from Sinn Fein headquarters to speed up the campaign of * assassination.Ten vaoated.police barracks, one courthouse and one coastguard station were destroyed.   There were 18 other incendiary fires, 29 oases of raiding for arms by masked and armed men, 26 oases of intimidation, 5$ cases of robberj of mails and other miscellaneous crimes.A number of the cases of robbery of mails are due to orders to seize passports and prevent young men from leaving the country, &quot;Dall Eireann&quot; having now, it is stated, passed a further decree &quot;prohibiting citizens of the irish republic/
SIBepublic xrora emigrating for the purpose of settling abroad without the written sanction of Government.&quot;A person who saw Michael&quot; Collins this week reports that he was shown a number of official documents, including photostats of the Barry documents, rti ich must have been oaptured in the raids on Mail vans.
