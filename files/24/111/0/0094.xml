(THIS DOOUteBNT IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS BIUTAiWIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). SECRET.C.P.-1891. 0 A B I NET.REFUSAL OF RAIH7AYMEH TO PARRY POLICE AI1D MILITARY AMD MUIIITIOHS.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.In my Memorandum of the 20th July (CP.-1657) I drew the attention of the Cabinet to the urgent necessity of taking aotion to ensure that the Irish Railways would fulfil their obligations in regard to the csrriage of polios, military and munitions traffic or else go out of action.     The position to-day is practically unchanged.      Despite the representations made by the Ministry of Transport to the Railway Companies, the refusal of the men to handle Oovernmerit traffic continues in the south and west of Ireland and the refusal is made with impunity for it is apparent that the Companies are not energetic in taking action against their employees who refuse to do their duty.   This condition of affairs must be brought to an end.      The Irish Government ie very seriously embarrassed by the denial of the use of the railways and its position in the matter is humiliating and discreditable.The simplest course would be to close down the railways altogether;   this would, however, have a most serious effect on the economic life of the country and until all othef&quot;measures, have failed would be politically inadvisable.     It appears to me that the proper course to pursue is to ensure the dismissal of the men who refuse to do their duty and to bring every pressure to bear on the companies to secure this end.The Minister of Transport tells me that he has no power as Minister of Transport to give orders to the Irish Railways in regard to the dismissal of their men.     I ask the CabinettoCopy Ho.
to authorise the issue of a definite instruction to the companies to the effect that they must carry Government traffic and personnel and must immediately dismiss any and every employee who refuses to do hid duty as regards handling this traffic * I ask also that this instruction be aooom anied by an intimation that in the event of any Railway not carrying government traffio and not dismissing every single employee concerned in the failure of the railway to carry the traffic, the Government will withhold *&apos;rom the Company the Government subsidy.It is absurd that the Government should continue to sub-si&amp;ise at the expense of the general body of taxpayers the shareholders of a Railway. Company that refuses to carry Government traffic or to provide funds wherewith to pay Increased wages to the very men who refuse to handle the traffic.In Sir Hardman Lever&apos;s Memorandum of the ,:2nd July which was circulated by the Chans ell or of the Exchequer (CP ,.1671) it was stated that legal advice had been given to the effect &apos; that payment of the subsidy could not be withheld from Companies that did not carry Government traffic:   I should wait for the point to be raised in the Courts and if necessary seek fresh legislation.The issue must be joined with the railway men and in my opinion, in this matter as in all other Irish matters, a clear, firm, and consistent policy will soon re-establish norGial conditions and defeat the gang of terrorists that now menace the country.(Initialled)    H.G.IRISH OFFICE.&amp;5th September, 19 0.
