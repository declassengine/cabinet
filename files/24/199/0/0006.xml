MEMORANDUM  BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.    , IN order to estimate  the prospects of an improvement in overseas trade in thecoming year, with particular reference to unemployment, instructions were sent  toHis Majesty&apos;s  Commercial  Counsellors, Secretaries and Trade  Commissioners,  tofurnish reports.  The attached memorandum on trade recovery and unemployment has been drawn up by the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Labour and the Depart-ment of Overseas Trade after consideration of the reports received.                                                                    P. C.-L.    Board of Trade, November 24, 1928.                         OVERSEAS  TRADE PROSPECTS.    Unemployment has been particularly marked and persistent in certain of ourleading export industries, and, in  order to  ascertain what improvement, if any,during the coming winter could be anticipated as a result of improved demand from overseas markets, His Majesty&apos;s Commercial Counsellors, Secretaries and TradeCommissioners were instructed to report on economic conditions in their respective countries, particularly in so far as these were likely to throw light on the prospects for British exports, and on competitive conditions in other markets.    Before summarising the information received, it is useful to classify the leadingmarkets for British goods according to their relative importance in our export trade,so that  due weight may be given to  the significance  of any change in the outlook inthe different  countries.  The export markets may be placed in the following fourgroups         Export of  Produce  and Manufactures of the United Kingdom, 1927.GROUP A-Markets taking  20,000,000              and over.British Empire              Million  .

Grand total of Groups A, B, C and D     ......   709    It will be seen that the great bulk of British export trade is to relatively fewmarkets, these including India,  the  Dominions  and the larger foreign countries.Statements summarising  the  economic position  and outlook  are given below forsixteen of these leading markets, together with a brief outline of conditions in theremaining fourteen countries&apos;for which reports have been furnished.   The sixteenmore important markets reported on took over  470,000,000  of British exports in1927, or 70 per cent, of the total (excluding the Irish Free State), while the remainingcountries took nearly  70,000,000, or a further 10 per cent.BRITISH  EMPIRE.United Kingdom Exports, 1927, in   millions.

In India the basic conditions are sound; finances are favourable, the rupee hasbeen  stabilised, exports  are  at  a  higher level, and there has been a series  of sixfavourable monsoons.  The present harvest is likely to be a good one, and the SeniorTrade Commissioners report is one of  restrained optimism.    Over 40 per cent, of India&apos;s purchases from Great Britain consist of cotton piece-goods.  Stocks of these are generally low, and there seems a good prospect of betterbusiness  as soon as importers consider that cotton prices have reached bottom level.The l  anna duty has  affected mainly imports  of yarn from  Japan.  Stocks of artificial silk mixed goods are large, owing to excessive imports during the last twoyears. The. reduction of  the duty on artificial silk yarns has stimulated imports, andthere should  be a considerable improvement in exports from this country of higher-grade yarns, for which there is a growing demand, as well as ultimately of artificial silk fabrics, thus helping to redress the loss caused by the imports of coarser  cotton goods; for  the moment, however, there may be a temporary set-back.            \     The outlook for  iron and steel goods appears to be bright, both on account of probable railway, public  works, and general industrial requirements and of the lower
rates of duty on British standard steel. The application of power to small industriestagricultural operations, &amp;c, would  also  make for increased demand.   Furtherbenefit to engineering industries should come from harbour developments, irrigationand hydro-electric  developments.   The Indian Store Departments purchases arelikely to increase, but a larger proportion of orders has recently been placed on theContinent.   The prospects are favourable for the steady increase of demand for the metal industries during the next year or  two, and some  part of this  should benoticeable in the next few months.  The British electrical engineering industry is ina strong competitive position, and their technical and sales  organisation in india should enable  them to benefit largely.    There  is an opening for more motor-cars, but apart from three leading british firms  local  sales organisation is generally inadequate, whereas  the General MotorsCorporation (U.S.A.) alone employs fifteen  factory representatives,  and the numberis to be increased.  A steadily increasing demand for British films may be anticipatedas they are preferred by a considerable section of the cinema public.A australia.    Overseas  trade, and particularly imports,  have in  1928 been below the level of1927.   Stocks have been high and credit conditions unfavourable, but the former havenow been reduced  and indications are  in favour of  a prosperous season,  as anincreased wool clip is assured and very large crops anticipated. The advantage ofthe latter, however, will be diminished by low prices  following good world harvests.An important factor in the  outlook is  the loan position.   Heavy borrowing hasencouraged imports  which have  been  above  the  normal  purchasing  power ofAustralia^ own productive resources.  There  is, however, no  marked tendency toreduce borrowing  for development purposes, and  the  indications  are that it  willcontinue at a high rate.Canada.    Business  activity is at a higher level than it  has  been for a  number of years.During the past eighteen months some 200 factories have been extended and 100 new ones erected, notably in the artificial silk, pulp and paper, motor and constructionalmaterial industries.  Cotton mills, however, have been  running at  only 60 per cent.capacity,  and the position in the woollen industry is  only fair.   The harvest willprobably be one of the best of recent years, but lower prices will to some extent reducethe benefit  of this to the farmer.  A short lull in business activity may occur, followedby renewed prosperity.    Despite local  industrial development,  opportunities for more  trade exist (e.g., for building materials, fittings, &amp;c.)  if the market were more closely studied.  Constructional material of iron  and steel should be in demand, butquick delivery is necessary, as the competition of the United States makers, whose.quotations have been falling, is severe.  There should also be openings for up-to-dateiron and steel mill and saw milling equipment and for  cotton mill machinery.South Africa.    Exports from  South Africa have steadily increased during the last few  yearsand now reach  90 millions annually, of which one-half is gold;   other importantarticles being diamonds, wool and maize.  The output of gold reached a record figurelast year and this rate has been maintained, but no considerable  increase, if any, canbe expected in the export of either gold or diamonds.  Wool production has, however,improved in both  quality and quantity and the  present clip  is highly satisfactory.The maize harvest is good and the fruit industry is making progress, though droughtconditions have affected the crop  this year. Prosperity-appears to be general and railway replacements will continue.  Nevertheless, although exports and imports arelikely to grow, the disquieting falling-off in the British share of the latter in recent.years makes it doubtful whether British exports will increase pari-passu. NeW&apos;  Zealand.     The outlook is more promising than it has been  for some time.  The temporarydepression seems to have definitely passed, and increased production and good prices have  been  obtained.  Purchasers haye, however,  displayed  caution,  and  these       [18483]                          &apos;&apos;:                              B 2

The internal position gives an impression of well-maintained progress, although there has been a sharp falling off in activity in the textile trades since 1927, due toearlier  over-buying.   Nevertheless,  unemployment, arising originally  from  the inflation of the mark, remains a serious problem, for which no early solution can beexpected.  Increased competition from German  industries,  to the organisation ofwhich considerable attention has been given, is likely.  They have advantages in low wages and elastic eight-hour legislation,  as well as in the relief from the burdenof fixed interest charges which resulted from the collapse of the mark,  and in thevigorous support given to industry by the German banks.   There is, however,  ashortage of capital, and rates of interest are high.  It is hoped that this will be made good from abroad, but  present indications do not suggest that  there  will be  acheapening of  capital in  the near future.   German competition is likely  to be weakened by the upward&apos; tendency of wages and costs of production,  possibly for  atime by the recent lock-out in the heavy metallurgical industries and in the increaseof freight charges on the railways by about 10 per  cent.   These  increases, however,do not affect the &quot; exceptional &quot; rates, most of which exist  to assist German industryin competing with foreign  goods.     Large  exports are, of  course, necessary in order to make reparation  payments,and  everything seems to  point to a German selling campaign of growing intensity.On the other hand, while  increased railway rates may. possibly strengthen british coal  competition in  Central Germany and  the Berlin district, it seems unlikely thatany  appreciable increase of our exports of manufactured  goods  to Germany  can be.anticipated in the near future.France.     France has in recent years enjoyed almost unprecedented prosperity, and this seems likely to continue.  All industries are doing well, except perhaps shipbuilding.There is practically  no unemployment,  and the  large  number  of demands  forincreased wages bears witness to the general prosperity.  The yield of the principalcrops this year  has  been  excellent.   Despite the great activity of business, however,no increase of coal or other exports  from the United Kingdom can be  looked  forduring the next six months.  There has been a heavy falling off in the share of  our trade taken by France in recent years,  due to  the great  development  of Frenchnatural resources and industry.   Though wage increases may raise  prices and sofacilitate exports from Great Britain to some extent, any general expansion in  our trade is likely to be a slow process.Netherlands.     The improvement in conditions which set in in 1927 has generally been main-tained and internal conditions are  likely  to remain favourable.  Both import and export trade have been at a higher  level than last year and  unemployment has beenlower.  The prospect of work-in the shipbuilding industry seems to be fairly good,but  in the  shipping industry the prospect is considered unsatisfactory.   The cropshave been  far  above the average,  but otherwise there are  no  indications of any appreciable change in British trade.conditions are reflected in an excess of exports over imports of  11,600,000 in theyear ended July last.  There has been some unemployment during the winter months,but the likelihood of continued  prosperity, coupled with  conditions of financial easeand a  large export trade,  suggests that  imports, of which Great Britain retainsapproximately one-half, should expand during coming months.
Belgium,.    Despite  the fact  that  approximately  half of  Belgium&apos;s  agricultural  andindustrial production is exported, the industrial position at the present time is very satisfactory and unemployment hardly  exists.   With but few exceptions,  which include certain sections of the textile trade, industries are working at full capacity.In particular, the heavy metallurgical industries are exceedingly prosperous.   Thecoal industry, however, is experiencing difficulty in disposing of the output,  andunsold stocks are abnormal.  There is wide-spread agitation for increased wages andthis should improve our competitive position.  The outlook for British coal exportsseems fairly good on  account of the prosperity of the iron and steel industry,  andthe demand for better-grade woollen goods may also improve. Opportunities exist inthe Belgian Congo for  further trade in heavy machinery, as  well as for domesticrequirements.Italy.     General economic conditions in Italy are still difficult.  The effects of the war are still felt, as well as those of the appreciation of the lira after 1926, and, althoughrecently conditions have improved, there are still some 250,000 unemployed.  This isa serious problem for a country of relatively poor  resources, but there are signs of returning confidence,  although in the artificial silk and cotton mills the situation isstill considered  unsatisfactory, especially  in  spinning.   The woollen industry hasmaintained a high  degree of activity.   The past agricultural season has not beenaltogether  satisfactory owing to the prolonged drought.  The general improvementhas therefore been insufficient to justify any expectation  of an appreciable increaseof demand for British goods during the next six months.            EASTERN MARKETS.United Kingdom Exports, 1927, in   Millions.

While there has undoubtedly been some improvement in the trade outlook duringthe last few months, it is not sufficient to warrant the belief that there will be any considerable increase.in  the  demand for  British  goods  during the coming winter.The loss in trade occasioned by the disturbances of  1927 was considerable, the sterling value of imports (about  140 millions) being about 20 per cent, lower thanthat of preceding years.   About one-half of the  imports consisted of specialisedgoods, as oils, rice, sugar, &amp;o, and of the remainder, only about  10^ millions wererecorded as from the United Kingdom;  against  23 millions in 1924.    Quite  apart from  the temporary disturbances of last year, the British share ofthe trade with China has shown a tendency over a longer period to diminish.Imports into China.

Exports to China  (including Hong Kong) from Great Britain during  1927amounted to only  103 million square yards, as compared with nearly 293 million square yards in 1924.  There is, however, some sign of a recovery as the exports forthe first nine months of 1928 amounted to 115 million square yards.
    The imports of machinery and other metal goods have also been severely affected,but already some activity is being shown in the work of reconstruction, and this mayprobably lead  to  the placing of  considerable orders in the  near future.   TheCommercial Counsellor at Peking sums up the situation as follows :         &quot; Our chief hope of  increased trade with China seems to  depend on the    ability of Nationalist Government to place national finances on a  satisfactory    footing,  consolidate  taxation, improve communications and develop  country&apos;s    export trade,  thereby increasing the purchasing power of  the  people.  When    these results have been obtained we may look forward with confidence to a good.    if restricted, trade in higher-class cotton and woollen goods, to a fair share  of    large orders for railway  material and industrial plant which will have  to be    placed abroad, and to increased demand for better-class  fancy goods  where    difference in price  is less important than in such competitive lines  as  dyes,    chemicals and paper. But there are no sure indications at present that this hope    will be realised within the next six months.&quot;    The immediate economic outlook in Japan is not promising, and until the effects of the financial crisis of 1927 are overcome, it is not possible to predict when and howimprovement will  take  place.   At the  present time  recovery is retarded by the weakness of the exchange and the poor prospects of the rice crop.    Nor can it  be anticipated that when  the depression has lifted Great  Britainwill recover the  very high percentage of  Japanese  import trade which she formerlyenjoyed (in 1913, 17 per cent. ; 1923,  12  per cent. ;  1927, 7 per cent.).  The generaltendency is for  Japanese imports to increase as regards  raw material and semi-manufactured goods, and for imports of fully manufactured products to decrease,although when trade recovers  there may be an increased demand for  goods of high quality, such as  machinery, tools and motor cars.    As regards the future of  British trade  with Japan, it seems  probable that imports from the British Empire, such  as Canadian timber,  Australian  wool and indian cotton and pig-iron, will increase, but that  imports from Great Britain willshrink.    The foreign trade of Egypt, although it has not attained the volume reachedduring the period of inflated values 1919-20 has now reached a more healthy con-dition than at any time since the crisis of 1921, and manufacturers can look forward to a steady and modest advance in business.  The outlook for the immediate future,however, is not very clear.  The commerce of Egypt depends to an overwhelmingextent  on the money received for the cotton crop.  Indications are that this year&apos;scrop will be large and of average quality, but the market is nervous and unsettledowing to price fluctuations, and this is having a restrictive effect on the importationof manufactured goods.    During recent years about one-quarter of the imports have come from the UnitedKingdom, and nearly one-half of this consists of cotton piece-goods.  In these lines,however, severe competition from Continental and Japanese manufacturers is being experienced.    The market for engineering material has been quiet since the completion of thelarge orders placed by the Egyptian Government under the  budgets of 1926-27-28.The budget of 1928-29 sanctioned a number of important schemes, but these will not materially affect imports during the nest six months, and when orders do materialisethe fact that  many continental and American firms are now forming local companies to compete for such business may adversely affect the British share.    Political and other conditions seem to show that our share of trade with Egyptought to diminish, yet it has been maintained at about 25 per cent, during the last few years.        . .              ..Japan.Egypt.AMERICA.British Exports, 1927, in   millions.United States1 of AmericaArgentina  ...       ...Brazil     ...       ...  452714
United States.    At the beginning of the year there were probably some 4,000,000 unemployed,but the total is now believed to be less.  There is, however, no serious unemployment problem  except in the textile, coal and certain minor  industries.   The recurrentdepressions in  the soft coal mining industry are unlikely to be remedied until the&quot;excess labour supply  is eliminated, but no constructive  proposals have so far beenput forward.   In the textile industry, where cotton spinners  are working at only about 75 per cent, single-shift capacity, the difficulties are due to excessive productivecapacity, lack of co-ordination between the large number of independent firms, andto changes of fashion.    Generally  speaking, however, a high standard of activity  is being maintained.Building operations have so far shown no sign of slackening despite the high moneyrates  prevailing.  Agricultural crops have been good, and farmers&apos;  incomes are likelyto be  better than last. year.  Though prosperity is somewhat uneven, the prospectspoint  to continued general activity  during, the next six months.   The course ofbusiness thereafter would  seem to depend largely on the persistence or reductionof the present high rates for money.    Any depression  in the export industries would, of course, increase competition in foreign markets, but a growing productive capacity is in any event likely to giverise to keener competition from American manufacturers  who have, acquired the habit of devoting direct personal attention to foreign markets.  Although business is likelyto remain  active, no marked  increase in demand for British goods can be expected,while the demand for British &apos;&apos; luxury &apos;&apos; goods may be affected by the general creditsituation.  The principal  obstacle to British trade, particularly in luxury  goods,which can be foreseen seems  to be the forthcoming tariff revision.    According to a report  of the Department  of Commerce between the  years1920-25, whereas there was a total increase of over 2,000,000 in the  numbers employedin trade and other forms of distribution, professional work and personal  services,there was actually a large  decrease in transportation and Government services, andalso in the manufacturing industries, although output expanded.Argentina.     The purchasing power in this,  Great Britain&apos;s third most important foreignmarket,  should be good for some time ahead.  Agriculturalists have had a prosperousyear, though there is some apprehension on account of the fall in wheat prices.  Inconsequence, imports during the  first six months of 1928 were   10,.000,000 in excessof those for the corresponding period of last year,  imports from the United kingdom were  4,000,000 in excess.   The fact that the  Argentine Government is balancingits 1929 budget with  an increased expenditure without imposing additional  taxationupon the assumption that this will be met by increased returns of import duties showsthat there are very strong reasons for presuming that this prosperity will continue.     Prior to the war Argentina obtained a larger percentage of its imported supplies from the United Kingdom than from any other country.  To-day the United Statesof America occupies  first place.  The great increase in the imports from this source,however, has consisted mainly of American specialities, such as  motor vehicles and accessories (including tyres), mineral oils, timber, agricultural  and other specialisedmachinery, and certain food-stuffs.  The only important trade which  America hascaptured from British interests is that of agricultural machinery, but an endeavouris being made to regain the lost territory.     The United Kingdom is still the chief source of Argentina&apos;s supplies of coal,certain  manufactures of iron  and steel,  railway materials and textile piece-goods.      Germany, Belgium and  Italy are proving  themselves strong  competitors  incertain lines, Belgium has done well in iron and steel, and Germany in the same lines as well as in analine dyes and  manufactured chemicals.  Italian competition is mostsevere in certain classes of dyed piece-goods.      The outlook for British  trade  is decidedly  bright and  can be  improved byenergetically following up existing opportunities.  A revival is beginning in the tradein British cement, good orders having recently been booked.Brazil.      The currency policy of Brazil has during the past two years exercised a depress- ing effect on trade.  Imports have continued to increase, but not as quickly as might have  been expected  in a country  which has recently  received loans exceeding  50 million, and where the population increases by a million every year.
                               OTHER MARKETS.    1.  The remaining fourteen countries reported upon, namely, Sweden, Spain,Netherlands  East  Indies,  Norway,  Poland,  Greece, Chile, Portugal,  Austria,Roumania, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia, account for approxi-mately  70,000,000, or  about 10 per cent, of  the total British export  trade.  Ofthis  70,000,000 half is taken by the four countries, Sweden, Spain, the netherlands east  Indies and  Norway.   It will be seen,  therefore,  that  the remaining  tencountries, though individually of interest as markets for British goods, cannot, since they constitute only 5  per  cent,  of  the total export  trade, materially affect  thecommercial and industrial position in this  country.   The whole groups ranges from such less stable countries as Greece, Turkey, Czechoslovakia  and  Yugoslavia toold-established markets  such as Sweden, Netherlands East Indies, and Chile.    2.  An examination of the reports received indicates that three of the fourteenmarkets, namely, Chile, the  Netherlands East Indies  and Poland,  present fairlyfavourable prospects for the immediate  future.   (a.) In the case of Chile,  the prosperity is based upon the  revival in the nitrate industry.   It is said  that at thepresent time there is practically  no  unemployment in the country.  There seemsto be a prospect that the existing  5,000,000 or so of imports  from the UnitedKingdom to Chile will grow,  provided efforts are  made  to meet foreign competition.(&amp;&apos;.) The Netherlands East Indies  ( 9,000,000)  are in a fairly prosperous conditiondespite low rubber prices, and developments, such as bridge construction and buildingactivities,  are proceeding, as are  also petroleum, sugar,  tea  and palm  oil factorydevelopments.  The textile market is overstocked, but import prospects are otherwisegood,  (c.)  In the  case of Poland ( 6,000,000) there has been a steady rise in thevalue of the trade with  the United  Kingdom, which, although.not large, shouldexpand in the coming year, since it is based upon the steadily developing productivepower of the country  and  the industry and  adaptability  of  the workers.  Thepromising position of Poland is indicated by a very marked reduction in the numberof unemployed, and although her products are to some extent competitive with thoseof the United Kingdom, it nevertheless seems reasonable to anticipate some increasein export trade to this market.    3.  Six countries, namely,  Sweden, Spain,  Austria, Czechoslovakia, yugoslavia and  Hungary, can roughly  be grouped together as being  likely to offer neitherimprovement nor the reverse from the point of view of British exports during thecoming period.  Of these (a) Sweden is a  comparatively important market, takingsome   10,000,000 worth of goods each year, but it appears to be a market in whichconditions change very  little, trade being largely dependent on old-established con-connections, and, in the view of the reporting officer, little change is likely to take placein the immediate  future.  (&amp;.)  The prospects of Spain as a market  are difficult tosum up.   There has been great activity in building and public works, such as portdevelopments and  roadmaking, and the main industries seem  in  a satisfactorycondition with the exception of the textile industry.   But in spite of the comparativeprosperity of the country no reliance can be placed upon it as an improving market for British goods, While uncertainty exists as to the position under the forthcomingtariff  revision,   (c.) Austria, considered as, a market, is dominated by the large amount of unemployment which still  exists there, in spite of an improvement in theindustrial position.   The  present  value  of  the  British import  trade  is  about    The disturbance caused by the currency policy is, however, subsiding, and it isexpected that the continuance of stability will prove a stimulating factor in 1929.In particular, imports of British coal are expected to increase during 1929.  Theimportation of textiles may increase during the next few months in anticipation ofthe impending revision of the tariff, though no change is anticipated in  the steadyluxury trade in Bradford goods.    Against this, however, must be set the fact that the crop outlook indicates thatrural purchasing capacity  may not show quite the usual seasonal increase  duringthe next six months.    Importers of British goods have to meet keen competition not only  from localmanufacturers but also  from other foreign importers who, in particular, have cutinto the following trades :  machinery (especially agricultural and road machinery),iron and steel manufactures, cement and tinplates.    The market, however, offers definite possibilities of  increased trade for Britishexporters, provided proper steps are taken to capture it.
 3,000,000,  and there seems little likelihood  of  a  great  increase in this figure inthe immediate future,  since such increase in purchasing power as may occur iscounter-balanced by the development of German  competition,  (d.)  Czechoslovakiaalso presents little prospect of an increased  British import trade, although  as acompetitor she is definitely developing.  The consequent industrial prosperity should increase the demand for imported goods, but the standard of living is still relatively low  and the  purchasing power restricted.   There does not appear  to  be  any immediate prospect of any rapid change in these conditions,   (e.) Yugoslavia is notin any  case an important  market, the net  imports being  not more than about 1,000,000 per annum.  A  great deal of unemployment  is reported as existing inthis country, though since the country is predominantly agricultural, it is different in character from that  of  an industrial  country.   Such  industry as exists is developing,  labour  being  cheap, but the general poverty of  the country makes itimprobable  that  it will develop  appreciably as a  market for  British  goods.(/.) Hungary must be included in this group,  although it is a country where therehas been a considerable growth of new industries and where overseas markets  haveto a considerable  extent  been  retained in  spite of the  post-war  disturbances ofcommercial  channels.   Nevertheless, capital is short and  the cost of credit is high,and it is not considered that the public will have  much money to spend on imported goods.    4.  The remaining five markets in the group under consideration seem definitelylikely to provide, if anything, a  less satisfactory outlet for British goods in the futurethan  hitherto,   (a.) Of  these  Turkey  ( 3,000,000) is  suffering from a generallyunsatisfactory economic position, and while there is a very large demand for imported goods there  is little money to pay for them, so that the  country either goes withoutor imports the very cheapest classes of goods,  such as Italian cottons.  machinery is badly needed, but there is every likelihood  that such demands as can be fulfilledwill be supplied from Germany,   (b.) Roumania ( 3,000,000) is dominated at themoment by the effects of a bad harvest, both last year and this year, and althoughthe country  is recovering  as regards the oil industry, there is little prospect  of any improvement in British exports to this  country,  (c.) Portugal ( 4,000,000)  has tobe regarded as a  doubtful  market owing to  the chaotic state in which repeatedpolitical disturbances have  left  it.   Moreover,  the wine export trade has  beendeclining for some little time with a consequent reduction in local purchasing power;the principal British  interest, viz., coal, is threatened by the  development of  hydro-electric  power,  (d.)  Greece ( 5,000,000)  is still  suffering from an economic crisis,and very little in the way  of an improvement in British  export trade to this countryis to be anticipated,  (e.)  Norway ( 8,000,000) has been affected for some little  time past by depression,  though some improvement has taken  place of late.  The canningindustry has had one of the worst years ever experienced, and there is little prospectof the demand for British goods improving in the near future.                              GENERAL SUMMARY.    Perhaps the most notable  feature of the  present trend  of our export trade isthe increasing proportion which finds its market  within the Empire.   United Kingdom-.

     The official  records of trade relate  for  1913 and 1921  to  Great Britain and Ireland, and for the later years in the table to Great Britain and Northern Ireland only.  In  order  to ensure  an even basis of comparison, the figures in the table represent estimates of the  trade  of  Great Britain and  Northern Ireland in 1913 and 1921,  an allowance being made by way of addition to  the official  figures  for those years relating  to the United Kingdom, for shipments to Southern Ireland. Throughout, therefore, Southern  Ireland is  included in the  &apos;&apos; British Countries&quot; in the table and  not in the United Kingdom.     Egypt has been treated  as a foreign country throughout, and Iraq, &amp;c,  as British countries.     During the whole of the post war  period when foreign countries as a whole have taken substantially reduced quantities of United Kingdom produce and manufactures the strength  of Empire markets has been a factor of the highest importance.  And since the consuming power of these Empire countries is certain to expand  with  the better development of their great resources, the future prospects also can be regarded with the greatest hopefulness.   Thus, when a  long view is taken these markets appear, generally speaking, to offer better prospects for British exporters  of finished goods than foreign markets.  In Empire countries there is  as a rule  a  preference for British goods; and as their  population grows and  wealth increases, demand will become more extensive.     Among Empire countries, Australia is  the  market which has shown the most striking progress, and  in 1927 took 8-63 per cent, of  the total  exports  of British produce and manufactures as compared with 6-30 per cent,  in 1913.  More recent figures show  the effect of the sharp trade reaction which has been experienced, but these effects seem likely soon to disappear under the influence of an increased wool clip  and a large  harvest.   As compared with pre-war years New Zealand  also has made a relative  advance, and the Union of South Africa  has also improved  its position.  The Canadian market, on the other hand, has not developed so favourably owing to the proximity of the United  States, and Canada to-day takes a somewhat smaller  share of our export trade  than before the war;&apos; at the present time Canada has reached a peak of industrial activity and all records are being surpassed. India, again, our greatest market, has been adversely affected by  the difficulty of  marketing Lancashire cottons and by inability or unwillingness to pay the relatively high prices which have ruled for certain  classes of manufactures.  In  the rest of the Empire progress has been steady and continuous and this fact  is of great importance since the aggregate British export trade to Colonies, Possessions and Protectorates is as great  in value as our export trade to Australia.  Taking the overseas  parts of-the Empire all round  there thus  appear to be  immense, though  not necessarily immediate, opportunities for increased trade.    Among foreign countries the United States stands out prominently as a market which is now taking  an increased share of our  export trade  as  compared with pre-war years.  In view of the unlimited purchasing power of the American people there seems to be no reason why this trade should not continue to  expand in spite ofthe tariff.  Other leading foreign  markets in Europe, South  America  and  the Far East have  generally become less important  as consumers of British produce and manufactures and in the aggregate show an appreciable shrinkage of demand, though it must  not be  forgotten that certain of them, such as  China  and  Argentina, still offer great  Possibilities.  On the other hand it should be noted that a large number of the smaller markets in every part of the world take a  larger share of our- trade than formerly;  Unfortunately&apos; the demand of these generally less wealthy nations is not sufficiently wide or elastic to compensate for the losses sustained in the principalmarket countries.  They do, however,  afford evidence that the demand for British goods is still world-wide and still extending.               j    We  may sum up the present  commercial  outlook  in  overseas markets  as follows :     (1.) Financial and trading stability has been largely restored in Europe apart           from Russia and the fear of abnormal  trading risks  caused by  collapse           of monetary machinery has thus become a thing of the past.  Financial           impoverishment remains, however, and the financial resources of the           newly created States are still liable  to severe vicissitudes which limit           credit and restrict the possibilities of  trade development.  Moreover, the           future of  Germany&apos;s export trade in relation to  the requirements  of           reparations payments remains a disturbing feature  in the market outlook.
      So far as finished goods are concerned, selling competition seems likely      to become more severe, and no rapid advance in the demand for British      products can be counted upon, except in the case of specialities.   The      movement towards industrial concentration continues to attract attention      and  points to the  development of  organised  selling  competition by      continental producers.  This feature of the commercial outlook appears      to be of increasing  importance  especially as it may pave the  way for      international agreements.  In the leading industrial countries, capital      investment in productive equipment has  proceeded on a generous  scale      and  this process seems likely to continue.  Social investment  for the      improvement of power supply, transport and housing is also a general      feature.  These expenditures have been facilitated by external borrowing.      The  relative scarcity of commercial capital suggests that saving has not      kept pace with the growth of expenditure, public and private.(2.) Though the unemployment problem of Great Britain has no precise parallel      elsewhere, conditions of a comparable kind are visible in many important      countries, especially  Germany, Italy and the United States of America      among manufacturing countries.  There are, however,  two outstanding      examples  of  countries which enjoy freedom from this preoccupation,      namely, Belgium and France, where a remarkable degree of industrial      activity has prevailed.  Some labour scarcity has even been experienced      in the metallurgical industry of  Belgium, and  even more generally in      France.  In several European countries currency and price stabilisation      have brought deflationary forces into operation,  and employment as well      as competitive power have suffered.  In Germany,  France and Belgium      there are widespread demands for higher wages, and labour costs are thus      increasing.   The  immediate prospect  for  British  trade is  therefore      somewhat better and the gap between British  and Continental costs seems      to,be lessening.(3.) The harvest situation, with few exceptions, is such as to favour trade      recovery.   The principal harvests have been, or will probably be,  very      good.  In India there have been deficiencies,  but these have been local in      character,  and the buying  power of the greater part of the population      should be good and  trade should improve.   In Canada the harvest has      been specially bountiful, and, in  spite of the low prices which it is likely      to command, the aggregate purchasing power thus created will  be high.      In Argentina,  again, agriculture has  had a prosperous year and  crop      prospects are good,  creating a favourable outlook for trade expansion.      In Australia an increased wool clip is assured, and here also harvest con-      ditions are very promising.   In South Africa the position and jprospect      are both satisfactory.(L) The direction of trade development .at the present time appears to favour      industries which are able to  satisfy the newer forms  of demands rather      than the older staple industries.  Thus,  the cotton  piece-goods trade,      though it should do somewhat better in India, for example, is now faced      there by a national industry of considerable capacity and  power of      expansion.  The depression in  the cotton  industry is  not,  however,      confined to Lancashire.  In the United States, and even in certain con-      continental countries, employment is poor and conditions are unsatisfactory.      Eventually, however, with  the  increase  of  world population and the      spread of civilisation, demand must recover,  as cottons are the cheapest      form of textiles, and therefore of the nature of necessities.  Similarly,      there still exists a surplus of producing capacity as regards coal, and there      appears to be little immediate prospect of any large increase in  exports.      The same may be said, in general, of iron and steel, improvement in which      can only be gradual.   On the other hand, the  demand  for machinery and      equipment, especially electrical,  is everywhere expanding, and British      suppliers,  generally  speaking,  appear  to  be in  a good  competitive      position.  The  export of such goods should,  therefore, progress. Price      and  quality considerations are dominant in the demand for woollen and      worsted goods,  but with the spread of prosperity the highest qualities on      which the British  reputation rests should find a freer market than has      been possible under conditions of general impoverishment.  Artificial silk      goods, and especially admixtures of the new fibre, are taking a more and
      more important place in consumption, and here, again, British producers      are powerfully placed.  A general return of trade  prosperity would      certainly bring with it  new mass demands for cheap fabrics of all kinds,      but this can hardly be  anticipated in the immediate future.(5.) Taking the world  IS S. whole and trade  IS Sb whole, there are prospects in      some  directions of immediate improvement, but a general recovery will      only come in time, and no sudden or sensational change in the prevailing      situation is to be  looked for.o
