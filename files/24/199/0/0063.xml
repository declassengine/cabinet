TW^NT   Cooar    OF [W 11436/309/98]                 ----   Acting Secretary-General, League  of Nations, to  Sir Austen Chamberlain.                               (Received December 4.) Sir,                                                Geneva, November 30, 1928.     AS a result of the report of its Third Committee and the work of the Committee on Arbitration and Security, the Assembly adopted  on  the 26th September,  1928, the following resolution with regard to the optional clause of article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice :          &quot;The Assembly:         &quot;Referring  to  the resolution of the 2nd  October,  1924,  in which the     Assembly, considering  that the terms of article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute     of the Permanent Court of International Justice  are sufficiently wide to permit     States to adhere to the special  Protocol opened for signature in virtue of that     article, with the reservations which they regard as indispensable, and convinced     that it is in the interest of the progress of international j ustice that the greatest     possible number  of  States should, to the widest  possible  extent, accept  as     compulsory the jurisdiction of  the Court,  recommends  States to accede to the     said Protocol at the earliest possible date;           That this recommendation  has not so far produced  all the effect that is     to be desired;         &quot; Being  of opinion that,  in  order to  facilitate effectively  the acceptance     of the clause in question, it is expedient to diminish the  obstacles which  prevent     States from committing themselves;         &quot; Being  convinced that the  efforts now being made  through  progressive     codification to diminish the uncertainties and supply the deficiencies of inter-     national law  will  greatly facilitate the acceptance  of  the optional clause of     article 36 of the Statute of the Court, and that meanwhile attention shored once     more be drawn to the possibility  offered by the terms of that clause to States     which do not  see their way to accede to it without qualification to do so subject     to appropriate reservations limiting the extent of their commitments, both as        A     regards duration and as regards scope;                                                &apos;ij         &quot;In this latter  connexion, that the reservations conceivable may relate,     either  generally to certain aspects of  any kind  of  dispute, or specifically to     certain classes or lists of disputes, and that these different  kinds of reservation     can be legitimately combined ;         &apos;&apos; Recommends that States which have not  yet acceded to the optional     clause of article 36 of the Statute of the  Permanent Court of International     Justice  should, failing accession pure and simple, consider, with due regard to     their interests, whether they can accede on  the conditions above  indicated;         &quot;Requests the Council to communicate the text of this resolution to those-     States as soon as  possible, desiring them to notify it of their intentions in the    matter, indicating at  the same time the questions  of  international law the     elucidation of which  would, in  their opinion, facilitate their accession to the     optional clause of  article 36 of the Statute of the Court;  and         &apos;&apos; Asks the Council to inform  the Assembly at its next session of the replies    it  has by then received.&quot;    As your Government  has not acceded to the optional clause of article 36 of theStatute of the  Court,  the Council of the League of Nations instructed me, in itsresolution of the 26th September, 1928, to ask you to be good enough to state  your       4707   [18660]
^x6vernmeht&apos;s intentions with regard to this matter.  The Council asks you at thesame time to be good  enough to indicate  any questions of international law the-elucidation  of which might, in your Government&apos;s opinion, facilitate its accession tothe optional clause of article 36 of the Statute of the Court.                    &apos; &apos;                                         I have, &amp;c.                                               J.  AVENOL,                                                     Acting Secretary-General.\ -
