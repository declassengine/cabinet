I circulate, for the information of my oolleagu.es*             reports whioh I have received from members of my Advisory             Council,  regarding the trade position and prospects.                  On the whole, the general improvement reported last             month is maintained.                  In coal, business is rather better and export prices             are slightly up.   The improvement in coal will probably             not increase the number of men employed, but will rather             afford more constant employment to the present number.  In             iron and st^el thero is also rather more business,             especially on the north East coast and in Scotland;  and             here again prices are hardening slightly.                  &apos;ihe trade in special steels is very good and the out-             look most promising.                  The number of shipbuilding orders placed is             satisfactory, especially on the Clyde, Tyne and Wear.             Orders in non-ferrous metals are well maintained and the             outlook is satisfactory.   In engineering generally the             position reported last :.month is maintained,  and, if any-             thing, the prospects are rather better.    In electrical             engineering the trade in 1938 has.been a little below that             oi 192? both in home and export markets,  but the position             is fairly good.                  Cotton prospects are better.    Good Indian orders             have bi-en placed, and the increased proportion of white and             coloured  cloths in Indian demand should  favour our  industry.                                            -1-
C) 9 ey&amp; zj s)    I only hope that this slight improvement will not  delay    the reconstruction of the American section of the  trade.    It is satisfactory that the -Manchester Chamber of  Commerce    Committee,  which now includes trade union members  as  well    as representatives of all sections of the industry, has    reported strongly in favour of immediate writing down and    reconstruction.    The weight of passive resistance is,    however,  very  strong  and  is. fortified by  the unwilling-    ness of a number of directors and managers to agree to any    proposals which  may lose them their job.         In the woollen and worsted trades there  is a  slight    improvement in the demand for light goods.   The industry    generally remains depressed.         In the chemical industry the whole market is  rather    quiet, but  export markets are better.         The King1 s  illness has had a depressing  effect on the    retail trade.         Generally,  the more hopeful tone  expressed last  month    continues.Board of Trade,    19th December, 19 28.

THE PRESIDENT aaid that, as the Council knew, theSpanish Government had announced that they did not proposeto bring their new tariff into force until January 1930,though it night perhaps in fact be put into operationrather before then.  However that might be we were faced withthe fact that they had denounced their commercial treaties with otlier countries containing a number of conventionaltariff rates which this country also enjoyed by virtue of most-favoured-nation treatment.  The treaties came to anend at the beginning of next year.  We were naturallyanxious to get the rates in those treaties maintained so faras possible.  About 200 headings in the Spanish tariff weregoverned by Treaty provisions, and we had at once made representations to the Spanish Government who asked our embassy which of those rates were of particular interest tous.  They said that some might be maintained.  le had sent toour Ambassador a list of about fifty headings of importanceto our trade, requesting him to try to secure the maintenanceof all the conventional rates but, failing that&apos;, to concentrate on the continuance of as many as possible of those particularrates which we had indicated to him.  Meanwhile it would bewell if the pressure which our manufacturers and tradersvvere able to exert should not be relaxed.     The Chinese had announced quite definitely that they proposed to promulgate their new tariff on 1st December and tobring it into force on 1st February.  At the last moment,however, they said that they were not going to do this asthey had not completed their negotiations with the Japanesewith regard to unsecured loans.  The tariff promulgation washeld up for the moment, therefore.  Tie understood, however,that if and when they did promulgate a new tariff, theperiod of two months before it canp into force would runfrom the date, whenever it was, on which they published itf.GENEVA CONVENTION ON IMPORT AND EXPORT  RESTRICTIONS.     THE PRESIDENT referred to the question of the ratification of the Convention for the Abolition of import and Export Restrictions which had been raised at theCouncil&apos;s meeting in October.  He had reported to theCabinet the view of the Council that the.Convention shouldbe ratified unconditionally by this country, it being quite clear that we should not be bound by the convention unlessat least seventeen nations became signatories.  The cabinet had approved this course.t The promulgation of the new Chinese Customs tariff was, infact, made ori the day of the Advisory Council meeting,5th December.  The Tariff is to take effect on 1st February.The period of notice is thus a few days less than the fulltwo months.
n n pCOAL.     LORD G-AINFORD stated that, as regards coke, the demandfor blast furnaces in the Cleveland and ?/est Coast districtshad been maintained and prices were a shade stronger.   the shipment of coke had been adversely affected by the verystormy weather, considerable delay to steamers resulting Incoke accumulating in trucks at the ports and at the collieries.The supply of empty waggons to the collieries had been verymuch curtailed and output had been lost at both pits andovens.  Forward business was a little stronger.     As to coal, there was not much business and the housetrade was still quiet..  There was a feeling among thePolish-Silesian coalowners that they would like to talkthings over with us - which was rather a new departure forthem - instead of trying to compete at ruinous prices.  Theyno doubt thought they might discuss how we could respecteach other&apos;s markets a little more than had been done.     Mr. WARHAM wrote:-     &quot;The output of coal in the United Kingdom for the threeweeks ended November 3rd,lQtto and 17th was, November 3rd -4,570,000 tons, November 10th 4,934,000 tons, November 17th4,895,000 tons.     &quot;The output for the week ended November 17th was 93.4$of the March 1925 weekly average basis, as compared with87.2^ for the week ended November 3rd.  The number of personsemployed in the industry for the week ended November 17th was79.6$, calculated on the same basis.  Unemployment for themonth of October was 25,1%, as compared with 22,5$ (revisedfigure) in September and 9.3% in March 1926.     &quot;The quantity of coal exported from the United kingdom in October was 4,629,923 tons, as compared with 3,994,744tons in September.  The value per ton f.o.b. in Octobershowed a welcome increase, being 15/8, as compared with 15/4in September.  There ha3 been a sharp rise in freightsduring the month, which seems to be caused by an increased demand for tonnage in- general trade.  Probably this greatertrade activity will bring increased business to the coal trade, but, at the moment, shortage of tonnage is a serioushandicap.  One result of the improved outlook for shipping has been the placing of orders for a considerable number ofboats in the shipyards of this country.     &quot;We are informed that Poland is turning her attention to central European trade, which she finds more profitable thanher seaborne export trade.  The figures for export fromDanzig and Gdynia for November are&quot; not yet to hand, but weunderstand they are likely to be lower than in recent months.     &quot;The question of Reparations is causing us great anxiety.The safeguards which v?ere introduced under the provisions  of&quot;the Treaty of Versailles to protect the British coal trade have been modified from time to time, each time to the disadvantage of this country.  We believe that the whole
9 9 9COAL (CONTD.).question Is now being reconsidered and we hope that theGovernment will realise of what vital Importance  thenegotiations may be to the coal trade of this country.   would it be possible to take this up very strongly in the appro-priate quarters?     TPIE PRESIDENT referred in particular to Mr .l&apos;rarhamr observations as to the output of coal for the week ended17th November being  3.4 per cent, of the March 1925 weeklyaverage, as compared with 87.2 for the week ended 3rdNovember, whilst the number of persons employed in theindustry for the week ended 17th November had been 79.6 percent.  Unemployment for the month of October had been 25.1 ascompared with 22.5 In September.  In these figures, as  inthose for other Industries, the point often remarked was  that,following on a concentration of work in the more efficientcentres, the amount of employment that could be given did notadvance pari passu with advancing trade.  A good deal had been said about certain pits in Durham possibly closing on accountof the private colliery railways not receiving the amount of relief in rates which they thought they could claim, butthere was surely not the least doubt that, as rationalisationproceeded in Durham, whether any relief was given to anyoneor not, the result must be a gradual concentration of workin the mere efficient pits working full time.  And the  extentto which work was concentrated would not depend exactly onthe extent to which relief was given, but would be the outcome of a natural and Inevitable process of adaptation.     Lord Gainford agreed.IRON AND STEEL.     MR.  BOND observed that It had not been expected In thiscountry that the strike In the iron and steel Industry inGermany would last so long.  At the suggestion of the GermanGovernment both sides, as the Council were aware, had now agreed to accept the decision of an independent arbitrator,and work had meanwhile been resumed.  But the relationsbetween capital and labour in Germany were very unsatisfactory,and Otto Wolff had told Mr.Eond that their course of produc-tion, of seni-finished steel at any rate, was very much more rapidly approaching ours than it had formerly been.  The Germanstrike had, however, had really very little effect on theBritish Iron and steel Industries, and did not seem to have created any particular demand in any direction.  This was partly because of the strike that had also been going on inthe German ship yards, and the stocks existing in other branchesof industry, so that there was not the demand from Germany thatmight have been expected.  All this appeared to be evidence
9 o p^ d iron AND STEEL (CONTD.).that the chief competition in the British home market was from France and Belgium rather than from Germany.     There were 136 blast furnaces in operation in thiscountry at the end of October as compared with  131 a monthbefore, and pig iron production increased from 504,000 to554,000 tons.  The production of steel ingots also increased.  Exports increased, for some reason or otherimports also increased.     The position on the North East Coast might be regardeda3 much more healthy, and the position in Scotland wasdistinctly more favourable than it had been in recent months.  Production there at the moment was a little higherthan a month ago end had an upward tendency; present indica-tions poiabsd to the likelihood of the conditions nowprevailing being maintained at least one month and possiblyfor longer.  Order books were better filled than had beenthe case for some time.  A number of contracts for vessels had been placed on the Clyde, and the Increased activity ofthe Clyde shipbuilding yards was the chief cause of thepresent improved outlook.     The sheet Industry continued to be active.  The tinplate section was at the moment rather under a cloud.Demand was not as go&apos;Od as It had been, but order books were fairly good for next year, and better things at the turn ofthe year were hoped for.  We had got our arrangement withthe United States, and there seemed to be every probability of our being able to make other International arrangementsif it suited us to do so.     LORD GAINFORD reported that stocks of pig iron had beendepleted to the extent of 15,000 tons, but this was largely due to its withdrawal for use in makers&apos;  own steel furnaces.Sales of ordinary iron for foundry purposes had been woe-fully slow, but as the make of this quality for sale was onan unprecodentedly low basis, stocks were not accumulatingand makers were rigidly adhering to existing prices which on present cost could not possibly be reduced.  Stocks  ofhematite pig iron had  one down with regularity for somemonths, and November had provided a further reduction.   Theprice, however, which was considerably below cost, shoired no improvement and under these circumstances the probableblowing In of other two furnaces early in January next  onthis quality of iron seemed altogether inexplicable. Inspite of the fact that nearly three months ago Germanimporters stopped oil chartering of steamers to load iron orerates of freight had risen both&quot;from the  North of Spain andalso from the Mediterranean.     The lock-out in Germany had so far had very little effect on the pig iron markets in this country.
hj %) %JC0NBTBENTIA1.STEEL.     SIR ARTHUR BA1F0UR reported, that the general improve-ment in the home trade in steels was definitely continuing.He was pleased to say that the output of crude steel had reached 756,000 tons, which was practically the highestmonthly figure we had ever attained, outside war time.  Itwas rather strange, however, that the unemployment figuresdid not go down.   One reason might be that the men inemployment were working much more full time, and a littleovertime was being done as well,  though not sufficient tobring new men in.   There might also be a time lag too,to a oertain extent.     Competition for European trade was very severe, butthere was little new to say about this, except that we were doing better in Italy.     The alloys situation was very good, in fact we had never turned out so much alloys - tungsten, vanadium,chrome and so on - except in war periods, and we vie re, infact, behindhand with deliveries, and were having to put up new plant and furnaces.   Even the Americans had comeback to us for alloys, and very substantial orders forAmerica had been booked for next  year.   This was particularly hopeful, because that market had been deadto us as regards alloys for many years.   Canada was alsodoing an excellent trade.   The harvest was beginning tohave an effect, and they were placing orders in Sheffieldin a way that had not been experienced before;  and it  wasall for good quality products.     In China, in spite of everything,  we were managing todo a fairly good trade.   The trade marks question was still hanging on but it looked as though some reasonablecompromise would be come to on that.   The Chinese would ask for a small fee to re-examine,  or something of that kind.   Trade with Japan was steadily improving,  and wewere getting our full share of business in South America;Australian business was a little  better, but not  very substantial;   New Zealand was very good.   The trade with india, was dragging considerably;   the difficulty seemed tobe that there was so much local buying and one had tore-arrange all ones marketing arrangements before  being able to get hold of the trade.   That we were doing.     The outlook  for 1929 in steels was quite good, unless a very serious set-back occurred.   The turnover  fromSheffield for January was already fairly well assured.Exports generally had been quite  good - probably  quite upto those of last year if not a little better.
NC F-FERROU S METALS.     SIR CECIL BUDD saw no change in the conditions of the base metal industry during the month of November.  business was running through steadily, and on the whole quitesatisfactorily.  The indications, such as they were, seemedto point to better things, rather than worse.  Meanwhile the favourable report that he had given at the previous meetingof the Council might be regarded as fully maintained.ENGINEERING-.     SIR ERNEST PETTER wrote:-     &quot;On the whole the trade statistics for October show a welcome improvement over those of the previous month.  Thisis especially so in the case of our foreign trade returns,where the export figures for engineering and other metalproducts were distinctly gratifying.  At the same time, onerelatively good month does not constitute a revival in industry and trade, and there is always a danger of industrybeing disturbed by the uncertainties attending an approachingGeneral Election.     &quot;It can be said, however, that the position generally iswell maintained, even if there be no added strength.  Thetonnage of machinery exported in October was slightly higherthan in September, and the same remark applies to imports.The tonnage of machinery exported was 43,570 tons, ascompared with 40,531 tons in the previous month, and anaverage of almost 47,000 tons for the completed ten monthsof this year, the total exported to the end of Octoberbeing 469,313 tons. The average value per ton of exportsrose considerably in October, being returned at  101, ascompared ?rith  91 in September.     &quot;The total volume of unemployment generally throughoutthe country,, as measured by the percentage of insuredworkers unemployed, has resumed its upward trend affrerhaving remained relatively stationary over the previousthree months.  The percentage for October is 11.S as against11.4 (a revised figure for September); but it is encouragingto find that as regards the engineering Industry (excluding the construction and repair of motor vehicles etc.) theindex has fallen perceptibly, from 10.1$ in September to.7$ in October.   This decline of unemployment is whollyattributable to the general engineering trades, since theposition in electrical engineering remains stationary, andthe constructional and marine branches of the industry showedappreciable increases in numbers unemployed.     &quot;The recently px-iblished Interim Summary Report of the census of Production (1924) gives the details by groups ofprincipal industries as to po?^er equipment in 1924 compared-with 1907, firstly in horse power of prime movers, and,
ENGINEERING (CONTD.).secondly, In capacity of electric generators.  Theseparticulars show a noteworthy expansion of power equipment in the seventeen years&apos;  interval, of 58$ in prime movers h.p.capacity, and 383$ in electric generators k.w. capacity, oromitting power equipment in electric supply stations, 25$and 2S5$ respectively.     &quot;The Ministry of Labour, in last month1s issue of the&quot;Labour Gazette&quot; has published the usual annual analysis of the numbers of workpeople insured in the various industries.  As regards the engineering Industry theyshowed that the total number of insured workpeople at July,1038 showed an increase of .8$ over the corresponding numberat July 1927.  T^ie increase In respect of the general engineering trades was  .7-/i, for constructional engineering1.9$, and for electrical engineering 2.5$, whereas thenumbers engaged in.marine engineering showed a decline of1.8%.  On a further retrospect, however, based on the year1923, it is found that the number engaged in general engineering has declined by 9.3$ since that year, and thosein marine engineering by 14.2$.  On the other hand, thenumbers employed In electrical engineering have expandedby 33.3$, and those in constructional engineering by 20.4$.The actual totals of insured workpeople in the general,electrical, marine, and constructional branches at thepresent time are worthy of mention.  They are 575,240-;79,480*,  50,190 and 27,360 respectively&quot;.ELECTRICAL TRADES.     SIR PHILIP NASH recalled that at the beginning of thisyear the home market showed a considerable activity inelectrical industries, but this did not last very long, andhe thought that as a whole the market this year had been rather worse than in 1927.  So far as heavy plant was concerned, the electrical industries depended a good deal onthe demands of the mining, the steel, anu the textile&apos; industry as long as these were not buying, electrical manufacturerswere bound to suffer, and that was the position today.  Onthe other hand thi3 falling off In industrial orders at homehad been considerably offset by the orders which the central electricity Board had placed.   All the orders for theScottish districts had been placed, and those for the SouthEastern area, that is London and the home counties, werebeing placed.  Specifications would shortly come out forthe Midland area, that is round BIrminghan, and then therewould be a North East Coast, a North Vest, and a South Westarea.     In electric fittings, lamps and ao forth, the resultsduring the year had been much about the same as last.year.Buyers were generally just taking minimum requirements, andthere also industry was very important; lamps for factories and so forth were being bought on a minimum demand.  It wasthe same with Government departments and the railways-.
9 y? 3w  wELECTRICAL TRADES (CONTD.).     As regards exports it had been stated in the press - andthis was probably true - that British manufacturers&apos; businesshad decreased this year.  But It would be a mistake to take this too seriously, for one could not form a reliablejudgment on one year&apos;s data. 1926 had been a very good year for the British manufacturer in the export market as regardsvolume.  Prices, it was true, were always bad in the export market, with competition such as there now was, but it wasvery important to get a good volume of export.  1926 had beena very good year for volume, and 1927 was good.  Although in1928 we were down, this was a market which required to be judged over a period of years,  we gained the top place inthe world&apos;s export of electrical material, although we only just got It.  This year Germany might come out higher, but sir p. Nash would not regard such a change as a permanency.It might be corrected again next year.  It was largely aquestion of the class of plant required.  The Germans could make certain plants more satisfactorily than we could at themoment.     There had been just about the same demand for cables as last year, with, however, a little more activity in the lastmonth  or so.  The &quot;grid&quot; did not cause a big demand forcables as it did for plant.COTTON.     MR. LEE thought that the cotton textile trade was certainly no worse than a month ago, and prospects weredistinctly more cheerful than three or four months earlier.That naturally did not mean that the industry was now allright, because in the heavy trade, using mainly american cotton,&apos; there was still a very large number of spindlesstopped.  The character of the stoppage was, however,ohanging a little, and those mills&apos;that were running were running rather longer time and more mills were entirelystopped.  That of course would be very good if it were entirely the inefficient mills that were stopped, but inmany cases that was not the case.  There was still a prospect that the projected amalgamations, or some of them, wouldmaterialise, and he thought it was only through suchamalgamations and the division of the trade into a number ofbig units that the inefficient mills could be stopped andthe   efficient one a run full time.     THE PRESIDENT mentioned that he had been told thatthere was a certain amount of feeling in Lancashire againstamalgamations, and that people thought if they could carryon for another two or three years without breaking down,they -would emerge from their difficulties.  He noticed that the report of the Joint Committee, which was stronglyadvocating amalgamation, stated that unless capital was written down to its real value no advance could be made.He would therefore be glad to have Mr. Lee&apos;s opinion as tothe real feeling in Lancashire on this question.-B-
COTTON  (CONTD.).     MR. LEE thought it was necessary to realise that inbig amalgamations such as were proposed a good many people -  directors, mill managers and salesmen - would lose their positions and naturally the idea of amalgamationwas not particularly pleasant to them.  Then there was acertain amount of serious misgiving on the part of the merchants and shippers, because the amalgamations, to bereally successful, would have to go beyond spinning.  an amalgamation in spinning alone would do a great amountof good in reducing the cost of production, but it wouldnot achieve a sufficient saving to put the trade right.Therefore the amalgamations would have to be such as couldattack the bulk trades to India and China, and all tradesthat took big weights of cloth, and in order to be in aposition to do that they would have to make very considerablesavings in the various processes through which the clothpassed before it vras put on the market.  The bleachers,finishers, dyers, merchants and shippers were thereforeapprehensive of the movement, and, while many of thornrecognised it to be good for the trade, that apprehensionhad to be overcome.  The result would not necessarily be serious for them, but they would have to work on smallermargins and do a bigger turnover to make the same amount ofmoney.     MR. HAYHURST expressed the view- that the delay intaking adequate measures to meet the situation was dueto the inertia of the principal parties conoerned, whowere not willing to make proportionate sacrifices.     MR. LEE agreed that that had been the situation atone time, but he thought that everyone now realised thenecessity for sacrifices all round and that those sacrificeswould be made.  He did, however, appreciate the danger of delay, because if a small run of prosperity did take placein the trade, it would become more difficult to effect thearaal gamat i ons .     In the fine trade, the spinning mills were runningfull.time, though with difficulty.  In this section sborttime was particularly serious as it immediately raisedcosts and a considerable effort was therefore being madeto continue running full time.  Stocks had been accumulatedfor some months past but these were now being reduced.profits were not good, of course, but there was not any great amount of loss.SIR KENNETH STEWART wrote -     &quot;Generally speaking, the cotton trade for the past month has been normal for the time of year, that is tosay, it has been fairly brisk in most departments.     &quot;Our principal market, India, has been active andsome very considerable orders have been placed.  TheWestern markets, have not been very good.  South america has been quiet but there are no particularly discouragingfeatures in the outlook.  In many respects, China has
COTTON (CONTD.).furnished the principal features of interest during themonth. -- The total amount exported during October was con-siderably larger than for the past year or two.  China iscommencing her experiment in tariff autonomy by putting intoforce the tariff agreed irpon at the Pekin Conference of 1925/6.These duties come into force on the 1st February.  Thelarge export in October was caused partly owing to the peoplehaving anticipated that the duties would commence on the1st January and partly owing to a large export of grey goods which is now going on.-  These grey goods are used for dyeingin local dyeworks, and I an afraid that what we gain in thedirection of additional yardage in grey goods will be lost in finished goods.  The new duties will do little harm toour commerce so long as they remain at the present level.The danger is that they are liable to alteration at twomonths1  notice any time after the next twelve months.  Anattempt at co-operative working between different sectionsof the Cotton trade to meet Japanese competition in china is meeting with a fair measure of success, and it begins to look as though this was the road to success in gettingback some of the business we have lost.  No doubt otherefforts in this direction will be made if this initialexperiment turns out as successful as it appears&quot;.WOOL.     MR. AYKROYD pointed out that this was the time of yearwhen the placing of new orders was naturally looked for. Therehad been considerable difficulty this time in getting whatthey would like to regard as their due in orders, - largely on account of the unstable basis of prices.  In July one had found an entire lack of confidence exhibiting itself, andbuyers -wore rushing one over the other to get rid of theirstock.  Since the sales resumed in Australia, the Capeand South America, it became apparent that the basis ofvalues in Yorkshire had fallen much lower than the worldbasis, and of course a considerable reaction set in.  now the trade was undergoing a struggle over prices at the verytime when they ought to be trying to negotiate for morebusiness.  That was one of their difficulties at the moment.     In the combing industry supplies were getting ratherlower, and thoy were waiting for the new clip to come forward.  But, in spite of that, one per cent, moremachinery was running than had been the case last month.     The Worsted Spinners&apos; Federation reported a slightimprovement in the volume of business, but it was not known whether this was due to a rush of business for delivery be-fore Christmaa or whether it was a genuine improvementin trade.  Approximately 75% of the spindles were running.
WOOL   (CONTD.)     The wool and worsted manufacturers stated that theirpresent position was unsatisfactory.  From 45% to 50% ofthe looms were still Idle; and, considering the time of year, business was anything but good.  In considering thosefigures of 45% to 50%, It should be pointed out that veryseldom were all the looms running, even in a boom period,nearly always 25% were idle largely owing to lack of weavers,and owing to the fact that most firms had to keep a surplusof looms because of the continual ohange in the class ofmaterials they produced.  In Yeadon and Guiseley one or twoof the larger firms were better employed, but only temporarily,and the orders in hand were so small that there was no degreeof certainty regarding a continued running.     With regard to the export trade, one found that,comparing the period from January to October in 1928 with thatin 1927, we had exported slightly less tops, practically thesame quantity of yarn, and considerably more piece goods,which was a very gratifying position.  France, in the periodJanuary to September, had exported less tops, considerably less yarn, and more manufactured goods;  Germany, In theperiod January to October, had exported more in every section,- 1,800,000 lbs more in tops, about 3,500,000 lbs. more Inyarn, and 2,000,000 lbs. more in piece goods.  So that Germanyshowed herself better than the other countries of Europe inthe export trade.  England showed that she was graduallygaining ground in the manufactured articles, but unfortunatelywe had not quite sufficient business to keep existing machineryrunning, and this continual fight over such orders as wereavailable, so as to try to keep our machinery running, was making profits almost nil.     One bright feature of the export trade was China&apos;.  Inyarns some very considerable orders had been placed for Chinawhich would undoubtedly help matters In qur spinning industry,but in piece goods very few orders had come forward.  the season for Australia and Canada was not as satisfactory as hadbeen anticipated, and it was to be feared that the newAustralian tariff would have a serious effect on the Bradfordtrade.  A fair amount of business was being done in South -American markets in poplins and artificial silks.  In thelatter there had been an improvement recently, but the exten-sion of the trade was slow and gradual.  Artififial silklinings, which were replacing fine wool and alpaca, were in good demand at present, and large quantities had been shippedto Canada, but it was feared that this trade would fall offowing t*a the new Canadian tariff.     To sum up, we would appear to be holding our own; but thiswas not sufficient to pay the heavy costs which had to be met,or to run our machinery and enable us to employ the largenumber of people who were still looking for work.  From thepoint of view of orders, however, there seemed to be some improvement, and this looked to have some permanency In it, andnot to be due only to the present drop in values.  Much depended on whether we could keep to the lower basis of prices, for ifprices went up again the whole trade would fall off as it had done, last year.
6 &amp; UWOOL  (CONTD.)     MR. ARTHUR SHAW wrote :-     &quot;No doubt you will be aware that a few weeks ago theemployers asked for a meeting of the Industrial Council fort&apos;!&apos;.e purpose of considering an application to reduce the wages of the employees in the manufacturing section of the industry.The application did not apply to wool-sorters, wool-combersor those employed in the spinning section.  The claim was subsequently withdrawn owing to the discussions that were then proceeding between sections of the employers and repre-sentatives of the trade unions.  At a joint meeting held inthe Midland Hotel, Bradford, on 4th December, the followingresolution was unanimously carried:-          &quot;This meeting of Employers and Trade Union     representatives having received the joint report of     their respective sub-committees hereby adopts the     report and RESOLVES to form a Joint Committee with     the object of making a further application for safe-     guarding in the terms of that joint report.&quot;     &quot;I herewith enclose a copy of the report of the Sub-Committee (given at the end of this section).     &quot;Since my last report, which was presented two months ago, there has been very little change in the generalsituation in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the figures for thewhole of Yorkshire being as follows :-                  November  7th .... 20.00                     &quot;    14th  .... 20.08                     &quot;     21st .... 20.55                     &quot;     28th ____19.48     11 The general figure, however, does not indicate theposition of the various districts.  Whilst there has been a steady decrease in the numbers signing our Vacant Books inthe Huddersfield and Bradford Districts, the reverse applies to the Heavy Woollen District, where unemployment has now reached an abnormal figure.  The following are the details foreach week during the last month:-                  November  7th .... 25.95                     &quot;     14th____28.64                     &quot;     21st .... 30.36                     &quot;     28th .... 28.53     &quot;The suiting trade of Huddersfield has slightly Improved,but in the lower class goods the position is almost unchangedfor the Huddersfield district.  On the other hand, the reports from our Bradford District are encouraging, and there has beena progressive decrease of the numbers actually signing the books.   It should be remembered that the figure for September1928 was 25.47, and the average for the past nine weeks hasbeen 19.20.  The lowest point was reached in the week-endingNovember 28th - 14.93.     &quot;My colleagues will probably report on the generalsituation regarding the supply and prices of raw material,which,  in my opinion, will have a marked effect on unemploy-ment over a six months&apos; period.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL.247                 REPORT SENT IN BY MRARTHUR SHAW.                       TOOL TEXTILE INDUSTRY.                    SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES .1,       Foreign goods are being imported into this country  in    increasing volume at a price at which the British manufacturer    cannot supply.2.       The goods are mainly dress goods at varying prices  up  to    6/- per yard on present raw materials basis .  We consider that    a weight basis of 2 to 11 ozs. per square yard covers this    type of goods.3.       We find that whilst all the goods cannot be termed    strictly comparable, an equal comparison applies to very    large quantities.  A considerable portion of the imported    goods are made of single warp and single weft and the bulk    of the British goods are made with&apos;the two-fold warp and.    single or double count weft.  We are satisfied however,  that    British manufacturers can and do manufacture goods with  single    warps but it would appear that if the imported goods have to    be wholly replaced by goods of a similar character, it will    be necessary for British manufacturers to adapt themselves  to    the conditions and make in larger quantities the single  warp    c lo th.4.        It is fundamentally necessary if an application for safe-    guarding is to be supported, that British manufacturers  should    be in a position to produce the cloths upon which a tariff  is    placed and that the production should be capable of being    increased indefinitely to meet the demand.5.       Every endeavour should be made by the employers to  equip    themselves with the necessary plant for the purpose of&apos;making    a comparable cloth and  that the operatives should do every-    fning possible to assist in establishing this type of manu-    facture.  We also expect the manufacturers to obtain their    supplies of tops and yarns from this country.  If such supply    is not immediately available topmakers and spinners should    proceed to equip themselves for this purpose.6,       Any tariff given to the trade should be limited to  a    number of years and, If possible, taken off gradually.V.        If a tariff is granted, a permanent committee shall be    established between the Employers and the Trade Unions for  the    purpose of analysing the situation from time to time, and    assuring themselves that every effort Is being made in    accordance with Clauses 4 and 5 to carry out the recommendations.    If the Trade Union representatives are of opinion during the    currency of the tariff, that such tariff is detrimental  to  the    interests of the workers or if the Employers, on the other  hand,    consider that such tariff is detrimental to their interests,    either party should have the right to approach the Government    and ask for its cancellation.&apos;8.        Cone lug ion:  We have therefore come to the. conclusion    that TJnemp 1 oyrrient in the Wool Textile Industry has been and    is likely to be accentuated by the importation of foreign    dress good.s and. we agree that this joint committee of    Employers and the Trade Unions should support a further    application for safeguarding.
ARTIFICIAL SILK.     MR. ADDISON observed that there was difficulty In theindustry at present from the standpoint of both the producer and the consumer.  Producers were experiencing difficultiesowing to drastic price cutting by some of their own numbers,and this naturally created nervousness on the part of buyerswho were unwilling in their turn to place business with the manufacturer, who was the consumer of artificial silk, for  fearof further price reductions.  Prices would, however,  it was hoped, become steadier in the near future and bring about anImprovement in trade.  As far as could be ascertained a some-what similar price-cutting was going on on the Continent,notably in France and Italy, with the result that the overseas markets, especially India and, to a lesser extent, china were swamped with quantities of yarn for which ridiculousprices were being taken.  Until these conditions became more normal the English export trade would not be satisfactory,except in the markets where high-class yarns and specialitieswere wanted.CHEMICALS.     MR. HILL said that business in the home trade  had  been disappointing during the past month, but this appeared  tobe due to depression In the industries using chemicalsrather than to any increased importation of foreign chemicals.The export trade, on the other hand, was satisfactory and forseveral months there had been a continued and steady improvementIn export markets generally.  This was especially true  of theSouth American markets. In particular Brazil, Chile endColombia.   Amongst Empire markets Australia formed an exception&quot;  here trading conditions were bad and businessshowed a diminishing tendency.  New Zealand,  on  the other hand,was extremely good.     The Statistics relating to the nitrogen fertilisersindustry for the year ended June 30th showed that the world production of nitrogen fertilisers in 1927/28 was greaterby 420,000 tons or 34 per cent., than in the previous year.The agricultural consumption was 1,400,000 tons, which  wasa quarter of a million tons greater than in the  previous year.  The increase in both production and consumption  wasthe largest ever recorded and was equal to the total worldoutput twenty-five years ago.  Consumption of fertilisersin Germany had been slightly less, but other Europeanmarkets, the United States and the Far East all  showedremarkable expansion.   It was e estimated that during thecurrent year there would be an increase of from  200,000to 250,000 tons in the output of synthetic nitrogen and anincrease of about 100,000 tons in the-output of  Chileannitrate.  In spite of that the producers had taken  adecision to maintain their prices, which was an  indication
CHEMICALS (OONTD, )that there was no over-production anticipated.   There were50,000 acres of pasture-land in this country &quot;being successfullytreated under the new system of grassland management,  which appeared to be a justification of the large sums expended  in research upon that subject.  A number of Scottish fertiliserworks were to be organised under the aegis of Imperial chemical industries Limited and directed by a controlling company.GENERAL TRADE.     LORD GAINFORD, speaking for the Federation of BritishIndustries, pointed out that the imports of the country rose from  87,000,000 in September to  102,000,000 in October, whilst the increase in the exports was from  56,000,000 to  64,000,000.This improvement was,perhaps, partly to be explained by theinclusion in the October figures of  some Items which shouldmore properly belong to September, due to the arrival of moreships during September than October.  Certain of the productionfigures, however, were also encouraging.  The output of ironduring the month rose by 40,000 tons, of steel by 37,000 tons,and of coal by 100,000 tons.     Among other trades for which no separate report hadbeen submitted to the Council, the boot and shoe trade atNorthampton had continued to be quiet, though certain manu-facturers in that area had reported an improvement during themonth.  Export trade, however, had remained in an encouragingcondition.     Reports for November with regard to the shipbuilding industry had.  undergone a considerable change for the better;a large number of new and important contracts had been placed for Clyde shipbuilding and engineering industries, but whilst the contracts did not represent anything like as much tonnageas was required to restore all the yards to full activity,several of the larger yards had orders for practically all  theirberths.  That was also understood to be the tenour of thereports from some of the shipbuilding yards at Hartlepool andon the Tyne and on the Wear.  On the Tees shipbuilding orders had not filled the berths.  Ship-repairing continued to  beactive during the month.  Motor car and cycle factories  reportedthat output was being increased owing to the accumulation oforders for new season&apos;s types.     On the whole the general feeling appeared to  be that wewere going to  begin the New Year with a much better prospect .than we had about two months ago.
     GENERAL, TRADE (CONTD.).Co-operative Wholesale Society.     MR. HAYBURST reported that in November, as compared withNovember last year, the Society had been fairly successful.The increases In sale*s were not large when expressed aspercentages, but after carefully reviewing the. figures forthe -month, they had every reason to be satisfied with thebusiness done.  The Society &quot;had made special efforts toIncrease their purchases from Empire countries and in thelast six months they had bought goods In that way to the valueof eight to nine millions, consisting of meat, butter, fruit and canned goods.  They hoped that this attitude would bereciprocated by the Dominions and Colonies,  In their bankingdepartment deposits were going- up and it was significant thatthese came &quot;from the artisan class.  The increase, in the lasteight months had been over five million pounds.     As regards details of the Co-operative Society&apos;s trade,they had increased their purchases of butter from New zealand and Australia and they had similarly increased their purchases in the Empire of cheese and wheat, especially from canada.  With regard to tea, large auctions had ruled Inthe past fortnight at higher prices, but they had been ableto reduce their prices to the public considerably during thelast few months; the reduction had meant perhaps  150^000difference In profit, but the public had^got the &quot;benefit ofit and It had left a sufficient margin to the Society.  In thecocoa market the American combine had burned their fingers andhad had to hold Stocks that they could not deal with.  Thiswas causing violent fluctuations in prices and there had beena drop of nearly  10 a ton.  Home makers of chocolate were infull work with the Christmas trade, which showed signs of aslight improvement over last year.Ret, ai ljrrade^     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE observed that the  general retail -trade for the month of November had not been up to expects-tions.  The first fortnight had started well, but  there hadbeen a decrease during the last fortnight, due, no doubt, toreduced purchases by the public In view of the illness of theKing,  Trade in London had, however, held its own  and Londonstores had shown an Increase for the month.     Sir Woodman had just returned from Argentina, and was glad to report that the retail trade there was very good.  the spending power of the Argentine had greatly  Increased andwould continue to expand for the next few years.   An  important point was that English goods were preferred  to American goodsbecause they were more reliable and deliveries were better.lie strongly advised manufacturers to get into touch with the markets In Argentina because there was a big trade to bedone there.
CONFIDENTIAL.GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING.     MR. HOLLAND MARTIN stated that the bank clearances for November showed an increase of about  251,000,000, or 7%over those for November last year, and this was about therate of increase that had been operating through the whole ofthis year.  But it certainly did not mean that trade had been any more active; there had been a considerable lag generally in trade,.  The Money Market in November had not been toocomfortable j there had been a shortage of credit and the exports of gold had given rise to a fear that the Bank Ratemight rise,,  The position had now become a little easier,however, owing to the improvement in the sterling exchange,and no longer allowed gold to be taken profitably to theU.S.A.     The two outstanding financial events of the month hadbeen  the transfer of the Note Issue to the Bank of Englandand the alteration In the Bank of England figures showingbankers1 clearances.  The issue of the new Treasury Bonds hadbeen very well received, and the position, he thought, wasa good one.     From the trade point of view,the bankers were findingvery little  Improvement.  Loans were very sticky, and therewas not very much fresh business being done.  There had beena great deal of speculation on the Stock Exchange, and hethought that that speculation and the rapid changes that hadtaken place in the Money Market were the factors, rather than any increase in trade, that really accounted for the increasein the bank clearances.     With regard to the many successful new  Issues,Mr,Martin thought that not much new money had gone into them.Many of the new issues were used to repay bank loans and themoney thus released had gone back again into these issues. Aconsiderable part of certain new Issues had been subscribedin America and the Underwriters , too, had had to take acertain amount.  There was, however, in his experience, noshortage of money for new business, or for working capital Inany good scheme of amalgamation.SHIPPING.  -   MR, ALEXANDER SHAW sent the following figures:-Index Number of Shipping Freights.1920 - 1001913 Z 100October 1928..September 1928October 1927..27.2725.8027.34116.54110.26116.84Tonnage laid up at the principal  ports  of Great  Britainand Ireland.British and Foreign      Net tons.October 1st 1928July 1st 1928...October 1st 1927415,399495,866272,839

PHILLIPS was afraid there were few encouragingsigns in the unemployment figures for November.   As inOctober, there had been a decrease at the beginning ofthe month and this was followed by an increase in thelast two weeks, leaving the total over twenty thousandhighex- than at the end of October.   The course of thefigures in October and November seemed to have begin  .largely influenced by the arrangements, which he was told were commonly made under the Five Counties scheme in the coal industry, for concentrating short-time working in the latter part of the month.   The effect ofthis was clearly seen in the figures for the two divisions covering the Midlands,  Yorkshire,  and theNorth East coast.   In those divisions there was a dropof thirty thousand in the unemployment figures in thefirst fortnight of November and an increase  of twenty-four thousand in the second fortnight.   In  other areasthere was an increase week by week in almost every case.     The table of insured persons in employment(reproduced below) again showed a decrease in the monthamounting to nearly forty-five thousand.  He would call the attention of members of the Council to an articleon page 388 of the Ministry of Labour Gazette for November which gave estimates of the changes in thenumbers of persons engaged in various industries and brought out the flow from the depressed trades into themore prosperous trades and from depressed part of thecountry to the South.

                    EMPLOYMENT (COM1!). )     LORD GAIHFORD mentioned that the reports of theFederation of British Industries showed that1 unemploymentduring October was slightly worse than in the previous month.   Improvement had been registered in a number ofimportant trades, such as motor vehicles, pig iron, cotton,wool,  linen, carpets, clothing, boots and shoes, pottery,brushes and paper making.   Against this there had to beset a falling off in coal mining, shipbuilding and buildingas well as in transport and the distributing trades.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR SANDERSON reported that, with regard to the woolsales, about 1,600,000 bales had been received in storesince the 1st July, and 500,000 bales had been sold. Therewas an active demand by all the principal continental countries, and Russia was operating freely in certainclasses of wool.   In the meat industry in Queensland,slaughtering  had practically ceased and the works wouldre-open in February.   There had been increased shipments of wheat and flour, mostly to Egypt.   It had been estimated that 90,000 cases of eggs would be exported thisseason.   With regard to mining, a new organisation of coalmining employees had been formed.in New South Wales withthe object of assisting the Government to effect improve-ments in the industry.   An important discovery ofmolybdenum had been reported on the West coast of Tasmania.     General trade, had been moderate, with some expansionrecently.   Bank clearances for the week ended 19thNovember had been rather lower than for the correspondingweek last year,  but the heavy clearances last year were mainly due to the distribution under the British-AustralianWool Realisation Association scheme.  The wheat harvestwas now proceeding and there were prospects of fair togood crops in all the States,  although a dry spell in western Australia had rather reduced their anticipatedresults.   Pastoral conditions,  except on the Eastern sideof New South Wales and Queensland,  were giving cause for anxiety, and rains were urgently needed in most parts ofQueensland, New South Wales and Western Australia.     As regards industrial conditions, a hopeful sign wasthe meetings, which had been arranged and were now pro-ceeding between employers and employed, and which SirHugo Hirst and his colleagues on the Mission from thiscountry were attending.
CONFIDENTIAL,INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY stated that, with regard to exports, therewas some anxiety in India about their manganese markets, as,if the latest rumours were correct, Soviet  manganese was assured of a market in the United States on long term contracts, which would affect India rather seriously.  Therewas nothing particular to report on the crop situation, savethat the outlook for 1929 was so far favourable.  On theImport side he wished to draw attention to the figures furthe ootton piece goods trade for the six months, April to september, 1928.  A surprising feature of these figures wasthat, probably for the first time on record, the imports ofBritiBh white goods into India had exceeded the imports ofBritish grey goods.  Grey goods had always been by far themost Important seotion of the trade, but since the war, theproportion of grey goods required by India to her totalimports of cotton piece goods had been falling and as it wasin that partioular market that Japan had been increasingher sales, the United Kingdom was in the position of havinglost ground in the market where her pre-eminence was disputed.On the other hand the market in India for white goods, inwhich the United Kingdom still held her own, was increasing.The market for coloured goods, in which this country waslosing ground only slightly, waa also increasing.  Takingthe three classes of goods in the order of greys, whites and coloured, the total Imports  into India pre-war were in thepercentage proportion of  51/25/24; last year they were45/28/27.  That did not show much change.  For the first six months of this year the  proportions were 40/32/28, sothat white goods had increased by 1927 from 25$ to 28% ofthe total trade and during 1928 from 28$ to 32$; colouredgoods had increased during the period from pre-war to lastyear from 24$ to 27$ and during this further year from 27$ to28$.  Ihe grey goods had fallen off in one year from 45$ to40$ of the total trade.  Even those figures were not quitefinal.  First of all, the Bombay production had fallen offon account of the strike and, therefore, the consumption oflocally made grey goods in India had deolined; but at thesame  time the imports of grey goods, which would have beenexpeoted to  increase proportionately, had also declined.Furthermore, owing to a- mistake in the classification ofgoods at the Calcutta Customs House, unbleached Egyptianyarn  goods,  which were a material part of the trade, had hitherto been classified as  white  goods; they now came  intothe grey section.  Therefore, for purposes of comparison with previous yearB the proportions quoted for grey goods duringthe six months  of this year  ought to be  still furtherdecreased, and  the falling off in the grey goods then becamevery  striking indeed.  The explanation of the change seemedto lie  in the Improvement in India&apos;s purchasing power andthe use of that  increased wealth In buying better goods.  Forinstance, there  had  been a falling off,  in the last  sixmonths, April to September,  in the imports of all piece goods into  India by  nearly ten per cent., but there  had only been  a  decrease  in value of  six&quot;per cent.  Tnere was undoubtedly  an opportunity for Lancashire to concentrate on exporting the better classes of goods to India.
9 C 9INDIAN TRADE (CONTD.).     Continuing on the subject of India&apos;s purchasing power,Mr. Lindsay pointed out that the prices India was gettingfor her agricultural produce were now very much morecomparable with the prices she had to pay for manufacturedgoods.  The year in which there had been the greatestdivergence was 1923, when the prlae index (pre-war being 10o)of cerealB in India was 113j the index for sugar, whichwas an Important import, was then 246 and for cottonmanufactures 221.  In September 1928, the index for theprioe India ,vas getting for her cereals was about 145, thatIs to say 4k5fo over pre-war, and she was paying about 60$over pre-war for her sugar and cotton piece goods, so thatthe margin between the two was contracted to a difference of only 15^,SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE wrote:-        In view of the keen competition existing betweenthe United States and our own manufacturers and exporters inSouth and Central American markets, the present viBit of thePresident-elect of the United States to the chief centres of the Southern Continent may not be without significance.     Argentina.  Commercial and industrial activity in argentina during the past few months has been somewhatrestricted, but it is expected that a general improvementwill occur now that business is commencing in the newseason&apos;s crops.  The new President, Dr. Hlpolito Irlgoyen,took office on 12th October, and has already held friendlyconferences with representatives of the railway and meat-freezing companies, as well as with those of the grain trade interests.  It appears that the President intends taking a&apos;special interest in the country&apos;a livestock and agriculturalindustries, and more especially in the further developmentof world markets for Argentine products, while any programmes for transport extensions will no doubt be sympatheticallyregarded.     Prospects for the pending Argentine fine cereal harvestsremain on the whole very satisfactory, although damage bypest has been reported In certain Isolated districts.  Thewheat has also been damaged by hailstorms In some areas,and, unfortunately, in tho Southern Districts around BahiaBlanca, neither the wheat nor oats is expected to yieldan average orop.  The seoond&apos; official estimate of the totalarea sown to crops places this at Borne 7 per cent, morethan last year.  Ploughing and sowing for maiae ispractically finished,&quot;and the crop is in good condition,Ihe areas in which the wheat crop was destroyed by hail arenow being ploughed for maize.     It is reported  from Bahia Blanca that the quantity ofBritish products Imported there continues to be disappointing,

The situation, however, may eventually be improved;by reason of the fact that contracts are being placed with british firms for the erection of new grain elevators at thePort, as well as for the construction of a new reservoir forthe extension of the water supply.  Nevertheless, It appearshighly desirable that there should be a moro extensivedistribution of British goods in the district.                                                             I     As an example  of the possible effects of the severecompetition  encountered by foreign manufacturers in theBuenos Aires market and its intensification by tho growth of native industries - a subject I referred to in my lastadvices to the Council - I have to mention that a leadingfirm of British manufacturers of prepared foodstuffs haveopened a factory in Argentina, the firm in question beingdoubtless guided by the fact that abundant supplies of argentine fruit and sugar would be readily available, apartfrom such considerations as the avoidance of Import duties,etc.  It remains to be seen whether there will be anydecided extension In the early future In the alreadyimportant movement  on the part of foreign manufacturers, toestablish branch factories in the country.     The Argentine  Government has issued the Budget Lawcorresponding to the 1929 financial year.  Ordinary expendl-ture is calculated  at a total of $704,131,453 (paper), theprincipal charge on the income of the Republic being that Inrespect of the sorvico on the Public Debt, estimated at^216,661,016 (paper) for the coming year.  Ordinary revenueis calculated at $705,000,000 (paper), the whole of this sumbeing derived from  indirect taxation.  By far the largestsource of revenue is the yield of the import duties, whichis calculated at ^326,100,000 (paper) for the year.   To meetthe expenditure for construction of public works, authority is given for the Issue of $158,000,000 (paper) of CreditoArgentine Interno Bonds.     Brazil^  The situation In Brazil has been adversely affected for some time by the restriction of credit, and regret to say that there have recently been one or two important failures.  The tone of the markets Is nervous,  andtrade is very depressed.  It appears that the Bank of Brazilhas adopted a policy of restricting its rediscount operations.There has, moreover, been considerable misgiving as  to thoposition of tho national finances,  more especially as it  hastranspired that figures supplied by the Treasury and quoted by the President in his Message to Congress some months ago,stating that there was a surplus of. revenue over expenditurelast year, have boon found to be erroneous.  The chiefrequirement for the restoration of  confidence in Brazilianaffairs is an official pronouncement in regard to the definite stabilisation of the currency,  and the pursuit of a consistent fiscal policy.     The Santos market for coffee has been dull in tone,  owingto the scarcity of orders from the  European and United Statesmarkets, but the volume of such business should shortly showan lncroase.  It is feared in some  quarters that the  election of Mr.Hoover to the Presidency of the  United States may proveunfavourable to Brazilian coffee interests,  in view  of  hisknown anti-monopolistic  views,  so that it may  be  necessary  .
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (OONTD.for Brazil to undertake some form of propaganda by way oflowerim prices or Improving qualities.  In. regard to theprobable yield of the 1929-30 coffee crop,  the estimategenerally accepted is some 20 .,000,000 bags, of which15,0 00,0 00 would be for tho Santos market and the balancefor the other States.  It is, however, as yet too early to regard theso figures as a definite forecast.  The crop willprobably be somewhat less than last year, so that thereshould be an  opportunity of disposing of surplus stocks,and it is satisfactory to note that exports during the firsteight months of the current year were considerably heavierthan in the corresponding period of the four preceding years,the quantity being&quot; 9,344,000 bags, valued at , 46,353,000,in January-August 1928, as compared with 8,795,000 bags,valued at  39,710,000 in the same period of 1924.     Unofficial reports are current in Sao Paulo that theproposed revision of the Erazilian Customs tariff may not bebrought into effect this year, but there appears to be aprobability that a special measure may be rushed throughCongress increasing the import duties on cotton textiles.Nevertheless, it would seem that the completion of the final stages of the legal stabilisation of the currency mayprecede any general revision of the tariff.     Chile.  With regard to Chile, the methods by whichnitrate&quot;Vales are being encouraged in the consuming marketsseems to have been successful.  In fact, there are indlca-tlons that sales have recently been appreciably abovenormal, having regard to the fact that the season duringwhich consumption is normally heaviest will not commence forsome months.  The number of oficinas In operation hasincreased to 69, which compares with only 46 in October,1927.The recovery in the nltrato industry is reflected in the returns of the Chilean Customs House for the first ten months of the current year,  Receipts amounted to 447,805,351pesos, against 388,521,756 pesos in the corresponding periodof 1927.  Export duties aggregated 230,274,618 pesos (ofwhich 224,665^841 pesos represented nitrate export duties),against only 180,696,472 pesos in 1927, while the revenue.from import duties was 199,993,791 pesos, against194,061,970 pesos.     In regard to general trade conditions in Chile, therearc indications of a further slight improvement, whileretail sales have increased, and the smaller merchants inmost lines seem to be in s stronger financial position!Imports into Chile during September last were appreciablyabove those of preceding months, and the October figures should show further expansion.  The Chilean Government has appointed a Commission to study and report  upon the generalsituation regarding the manufacture of iron and steel inChile.  The Commission will formulate proposals as to themeans they consider should be taken to establish themetallurgical industry on a practioal and economical basis.This may be regarded as a further step in the government&apos;s policy of developing national resources, which policy is bound to affect the import trade.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE J OONTD. )..     I regret to say that Chile was visited on the 1st Instantby an earthquake, accompanied by serious loss of life and damage to property.  Its disastrous effects were, however,confined to a comparatively small area, the most serious losses being in Talca, although damago was also reported in neighbouring towns.     Peru. Rumours have been reported from Lima to theeffect&quot; - hat th-e Peruvian Government has definitely decidedto recommend the stabilisation of the exchange on the basisof four United States dollars to the Peruvian pound  - i.e.about the present level of exchange - but no official announcement to this effect has yet been forthcoming.     The final official returns of Peruvian foreign trade forthe year 1927 show a small decline in the total value ofimports as compared with that for 1926,  This was accompaniedby a considerable expansion in the official value of exports,so that the visible favourable balance of trade was sub-stantially higher.  The actual figures compare as follows:-                          Imuorts.

Imports of cotton goods, woollen,linen, jute, and hemp yarns, as well as of raw or semi-manufactured goods were higher In 1927 than in 1926, but,following upon official steps to restrict Imports of luxuryarticles, purchases from abroad of silk and woollen clothsand garments, jewellery, furniture, fancy leathers,beverages, etc., declined.     In the year 1927, the leading county in Peruvianforeign trade was the United States, followed by GreatBritain and Germany.  The value of the trade with the fiveleading countries is given in the following table, togetherwith the relative percentage of the total imports and exports, respectively:-                                    1927.

The quiet tone onthe New York coffee market and the low level of the RiverMegdalena - the chief artery of commerce - have restrictedcommercial activity, and there is, in fact, severe traffic congestion on the River.  It is stated that business Inthe western section of the country is dull.  Real estatetransactions, however, are active, and building activityIs increasing.     Guatemala.  The dry season has now set In inGuatemala, and&quot;harvesting of the coffee crop Is In activeprogress in all districts -  Fortunately, no really bad weather was experienced towards the close of the rainyseason so that it would appear that the recent estimatedyield of 100,000 quintals more than last season need notbe revised.  No sales of importance have been made during october, the local market being dull in tone, but it wesgenerally hoped that increased activity would ensue withthe markets in the United States,  following the close ofthe ^residential Elections there.     Ndjsaragua^  The Nicaragua coffee-growing areascontinue to &quot;Be favoured by a very abundant rainfall, whichhas been beneficial not only to the berries but also tothe soil.  The heavy rains should help to keep the groundmoist until late in the season, which would be advantageousfor the crop folloxving the present one.
