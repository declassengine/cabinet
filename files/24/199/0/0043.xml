-S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY1 S&apos;GOVERNMENT.RET                                                  Copy No.    ^0                                   C  A B  I  N E  T.            ---.......--&apos;,393(28)                                   IRON AND  STEEL.                       Suggested Inquiry  by  League  of Nations.                  There is an  Important economic question upon which I             must ask for the  directions  of  the Cabinet  before we             separate.                  As a  result  of the  &quot;world Economic Conference 1927,  the             Economic Committee of the League lias been reconstituted and             an Economic Consultative Committee established.                  The Consultative Committee suggests programmes for the             economic organisation of the League to work on; that             organisation has  dealt already  with import  and export             prohibitions, statistics and Customs nomenclature.  On             tariffs the Consultative Committee have  passed a few general             pious resolutions.  Thoy have also made  a recommendation that             the best line of  approach to the question of tariff reduc-             tions would be by taking a few  industries separately, and see-             ing how far agreement can be obtained  as regards particular             industries.  At the same time they expressed the view that             where an.: industry was selected  as  many stages of manufacture             as possible should be covered.                  The following list  of Industries  was proposed by the             Economic Committee as suitable  for inquiry:-                           Aluminium                           Cement                           Leather                           Iron semi-finished products                           Cellulose  and  Paper                           Timber round and  sawn                           Fresh fruit  and vegetables                           Rice
Information was invited as to the national organisation ofthe industry, production, agreement? national and international and rates of Customs duties.     The first industry to be tackled seriously is cement.This Is a comparatively simple proposition as we are heredealing with an industry turning out a single article.    Thetrade here is well organised, and we have no objections to anagreement if we can reach a satisfactory one.     It is understood that in January the Economic committee epropose to consider whether it will be worth while to take-steps to get the question of iron and steel duties consideredby the principal European producing countries.  It Is In theinterest of our foreign competitors to raise this question Ifthe issue can be. confined as was originally proposed by theEconomic Committee to semi-finished products.  They may wellwish to secure an agreement which would reduce or abolishduties on such semi-finished products and tie our hands inregard thereto.  This would be good business for them.   Theywould secure a permanent free market in the types of iron andsteel which they export to us without making any concession on finished articles, steel manufactures, or engineering products in the export of which we are particularlyinterested.  Such an agreement, it seems to me, v/ould give us the worst of both worlds.     What attitude should&apos;we adopt?  I do not like to adopt a purely negative attitude, nor do I like to say that we  cannotconsider this unless America stands in,  I should prefer tomake a comprehensive constructive proposal and stand on that.I should say we are quite prepared to discuss iron and  steel,provided the field of enquiry is extended to finished products.  No one can consider the Imposition of duties  on ironand steel -without considering the repercussion of  those  duties on the finished products of the steel industry and the
     manufactures into which steel passes.  Any  discussion on iron     and steel duties should therefore  cover an  equally wide field.     It should embrace all  manufactures of iron  and  steel, and, at     any rate, the more import-ant engineering  products, ship-     building, machinery,  etc in which steel  is an  important     element.  Provided the discussion  is  sufficiently wide we would     welcome the willingness to make  the discussion  as wide and real     as possible.  That would be a test of  the sincerity of the     assembled countries to reduce or abandon  trade  barriers.  This -     line is, I think, the  one most likely  to  commend itself to     industry generally and is consistent with our general attitude.     If a comprehensive agreement could be  obtained, it would     certainly be of  value  to the finished  steel and engineering/     industries; while if  the other countries  refuse to accept such     a proposal It would prove that their lip  service to the     abolition of trade barriers is unreal.                                           P.  C-L.Board of Trade,     17th December, 1928.
