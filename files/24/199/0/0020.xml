3B0RBT370(28)This Document Is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sgovernment.                         C A BIB B T.Intention of the Railway Companies to seek Parliamentary powers to run air aei-vioesT&quot;  MEMD3AITDUM BY THSMlltfISTBR OF TRANSPORT.          The railway companies are considering the question of applying for parliamentary powers to operate aerial transport services.   On the 15th November I received a deputation fromthe railway companies who desired to ascertain the attitude ofthe Government towards their proposals, and the companies thenundertook to 3end rne a draft of the Bills  they propose tointroduce, together with an explanatory memorandum.   I have now received those documents, and append a copy of the railwaycompanies1 memorandum.                                       I          The draft Bill (which each of the four amalgamatedrailway oonrpanies intends to introduce) proposes to authorisethe company to provide and work aircraft for the conveyance of passengers, passengers1 luggage, percels and merchandise, hutto prohibit the company from providing services to or from anyaerodrome within the United Kingdom which  is not situated(a) in a district to which access is afforded by the railway system of the company or of a railway committee on which thecompany is represented, or, (b) in tho Metropolitan police district.          The Bill also proposes to authorise tho company toestablish aerodromes and to make working agreements in respectof air services with.other railway companies or with other companies or persons providing air services, and containsprovisions with regard to financial matters, and accounts andreturns,  to which I need not now refer in detail.
-S-          The Bill contains no provisions for the protectionof the users of the proposed, services in regard, to matters suchas charges and facilities,, and similarly it contains noprovisions (other than that no aerodrome shall be establishedby the Company within the United Kingdom except with theconsent of the Air Council and subject to such conditions,including the approval of charges, as the Air Council mayprescribe) for the protection of other operating companies or air services.   The attitude of the railway companies in regardto this question is that they see no reason why they shouldbe subject in this respect to any obligations to whioh otherair services are not subject.          On these proposals, I desire to malco the following observations:-     1.   So far as the Bills propose to legalise co-operative           agreements between railway companies and other           carriers by air,  no possible objection can,  it would           seem, arise.   The desirability of co-operation   i           between railway companies and air services is a           matter to which the Transit Committee of the League           of Nations has specifically called attention.   Indeed,           it seems possible that in this respect the scope of           the Bill as now drafted might with advantage be           somewhat widened, since it does not,  in its present           form, specifically authorise agreements relating to           the through conveyance of traffic by rail and air.     2.    As regards the proposal to authorise the companies           to establish aerodromes, subject to the approval           of the Air Council, here again little or no objection           can be taken.   The control proposed to be given to           the Air Council would enable provision to be made           for securing that the aerodromes are satisfactory           and that the aircraft of all other parties should           have a right of access on equal terms to any such           aerodromes.     3.   The main proposal, to the effect that each of the           four  railway companies should have the power to           run aiT services themselves, without any geographical           restriction, except, that flights are not to begin           or end in each others undisputed territory,  raises,           no duubt, more questionable considerations.    It           would, for example, enable all four companies, if           the^ were so disposed, to run services from London           to places abroad, in competition with each other           and with existing air lines.   It is, however,
reasonable&apos; to suppdse that railway companies if theywere to exercise such powers would be led like otherair carriers, by ordinary commercial considerations,to exercise them in a spirit of reasonableco-operation with each other and (subject to thepoint to which I call attention in the following paragraph) with other air carriers.There is, however, one respect in which, as independentair carriers will point out, railway companiesworking air services of their own would have acommercial interest fundametally different from thatof other air carriers.   It would be to the advant-ageof such railway oompaniee so to arrange their throughrail and air services, and the through charges forsuch services, as to favour their own air services atthe expense of any other competing services.   Anysuch action on the part of railway companies would provoke strong protest both from British and from foreign air carriers.   It will, I think, be necessaryfor the Departments concerned, in the event of the bills obtaining a Second Reading, tfe make suitablere commendations in their Reports to the Committees onthe Bills with regard to this point.Objection may be taken to these proposals on theground that a new departure of this kind should notbe made until the Royal Commission on Transport hashad an opportunity of considering it ana making recommendations.   I do not think, however, that this consideration should make the Government feel itnecessary to oppose the proposals in principle if therailwav companies feel that they are in a position tomake  $ut a case for thg immediate grant  of the powerssought.   The case would, in my opinion, be met bywarning them that any powers they may now obtain from parliament will have to be reviewed in the light ofthe Commissioner^ recommendations.According to the established private legislationprocedure under whioh these powers are being sought the obligation rests upon the promoters to satisfy the Committees on the Bills that the proposalsoontained in them are in the public interest.Standing Orders further provide that powers such as these, which are distinct from the objects of a railway company shall not be granted unless theCommittee on the Bill report that such a restrictionought not to be enforced with the reasons and factsupon which their opinion is founded.&apos;   I think itwould be desirable that any [general approval which theGovernment may give to the trlriciple of the bills should be framed so as not to seem to imply that thereis any intention to fetter the discretion whichParliamentary Committees possess.
Q H0 I  7,       I should add that  I am Informed by the  Secretary of          State for Air that there  is no reason from the  point    ,      of view of either  our obligations under the          International Air  Convention of 1919, or the  Air          Navigation Regulations under the Air Navigation Act          of 1930 why the proposals of the railway companies          should be objected to by  the Government, and  that he          would indeed welcome the  opportunities  for large          commercial air development that are envisaged in the          proposals.  He points out, however, that Clause 5 of          the Bill confers powers on the Companies to make          byelaws.   This is a power not at present enjoyed          by any air transport company in this country,  and a          reservation must be made  on this pointy  since          preferential treatment to railway companies can hardly          be accorded while  the granting of such  powers  to air          transport companies may present difficulties,          In all the circumstances, and witn the  concurrence of the Secretary of State for Air,  I suggest that I should beauthorised to inform the Railway Companies     (a)  that the Government, as at present advised,           sees no reason to take exception to their           proposals in principle;      (b)but that, as the Companies will realise,  any           powers which Parliament  may grant may  have           to be reviewed after the Royal Commission           on Transport has  reported.(Intld.)

Q Q0 0                                             Appendix                                  (Memorandum by the Railway                                          Companies)               RAILWAYS (AIR TRANSPORT) BILLS.          The four amalgamated Railway Companies of Great britain are proposing to introduce Bills in the present Session ofparliament to empower them to provide transport services by air and to apply their funds for that purpose.          They feel that it is their duty as the principaltransport agents of the country to neglect no opportunity of developing and impraving the efficiency of their systems and totake advantage of the latest and most modern development oftransport by air.   It cannot be denied that the rapid growth of road transport during the last  few years, while it has undoubtedly conferred a great public benefit, has had a veryserious effect upon the prosperity of the Railways, who, until recently, have been debarred from taking part in this form oftransport.   It must be admitted that the gpowth of road transport and Its ultimate development were not sufficientlyforeseen by the Railway Companies who to-day find themselvesfaced by a most serious competition in the hands of powerfulvested interests, and they therefore desire to be at liberty totake a share in the inevitable development of air transport, andnot repeat the road experience by waiting until the operations of such vested Interests has to be overcome.   Without going intodetail at the moment as to the nature and extent of the servicesthey would propose to establish, it can confidently be statedthat air services could be established which would be of greatpublic advantage and would enable them to avoid heavy capitalexpenditure in the future.          The Railway Companies are much encouraged in this view&quot;by a recent circular of the Air Ministry addressed to LocalAuthorities throughout the country in which the view is strongly
9 00 uexpressed that the establishment of air services and of a network of aerodromes throughout the country will be of the greatest possible advantage to commerce, and the Local Authorities areexhorted to set up a network of aerodromes to serve the general purposes of Internal and external flying.   The Railway Companiesrespectfully suggest that the encouragement so lavishly givento Municipal authorities should not be withheld from them,especially since such local competitive development, as in thecase &quot;jf roads, will be met out of finances to which the Railwaysthrough the rates wovild substantially contribute,   Thepossibilities of air transport in the future are illimitableand the Railway Companies would not be fulfilling their duties to the public whom they serve if they shut their eyes to thosepossibilities and refrain from putting themselves In a positionto take their share in developing a method of transport whichmust inevitably play a very great part in the future prosperity of the country.          The Bills which will be presented to Parliament havebeen drafted in the widest possible form with a due regard to thepreservation of the interests of the respective Companies Inter se,and with the object of avoiding wasteful and unnecessary competitionamong themselves.   Power is also sought to enter into working and traffic agreements which will enable the Railway companies to establish joint services or services to be worked by one company on behalf of another.   They will also be enabled to makesimilar agreements with other Air Transport Undertakings.          The Bills also provide that their air transport servicesshall be treated as ancillary to their railway business for thepurpose of the Railways Act 1921.   Financial and statisticalclauses are contained in the Bills similar to those approved byParliament in connection with the Railway Companies&apos; recentRoad Transport Bills,
          The Railway Companies confidently believe that noobjection can be taken to their present application toParliament as being either unfair to  any existing interests or contrary to public expediency.-
