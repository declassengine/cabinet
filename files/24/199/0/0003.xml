This document is the property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.13Printed for the Cabinet, November, 1928.SECRET.CP.  353  (28).THE CABINET.REDUCTIONS  IN THE BRITISH  FORGES  IN  CHINA.      MEMORANDQM  BY  THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR  WAR.                       (Former papers CP. 136 (28), 247 (28).)     1.  The  Cabinet, at their meeting  (41 (28)) held on  25th July, 1928, approved,    083 subject to the  concurrence  of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, my proposal,    5651 made in  CP.  247 (28), that two further battalions should be withdrawn from China without relief during the present trooping season.  Lord Cushendun having subsequently signified his agreement, arrangements have been made to  give  effect to the  Cabinet&apos;^ decision.     2.  The improvement in the situation in China which rendered possible the withdrawal of these two battalions,  has  been steadily maintained during the  past  three months, and there appears to be no sign of the  immediate  recrudescence of civil war.  A step towards unity in the affairs  of  China has been made  by the  formation  of a  National Council, which includes in its  organization every powerful war  lord.  Our  relations  with the Nationalists, and with  Canton, have improved to a marked degree, and there are definite signs that they are anxious to work with us rather than against us.  Since the Tsinanfu incident and the strong line taken  by the Japanese in Manchuria, the anti-foreign bias of the Chinese is now directed against  the Japanese rather than the British.  Lastly, the Red Peasant Movement appears to have failed for the time being, and the Soviet are believed to have admitted this.     3.  On the other hand the Nationalist Government has as yet not held office long enough to be firmly established, and the situation in the north is not so stabilized as this new government is ready to claim.   Further, though Communism may not be so apparent as formerly, its seeds still exist  under ground  and would be ready to spring  up  if the present government broke down.     4.  Nevertheless, I  am  of opinion  that the  recent situation in China shows  such improvement that it is now possible  safely to  effect a further reduction of our forces in that country which will bring them down to six battalions the number which  I  have previously recommended for our ultimate permanent garrison in China (C.I.D. paper 900-B and CP. 278 (28)).     5.  The  General Officer Commanding, North China  Command, has  expressed the view  that the  adverse  factors referred  to in  paragraph 3 above  make it  advisable at. present  to withdraw only one further  battalion, which would leave  the Far Eastern garrison at a strength of seven battalions.     6.  Further, he rightly calls attention to the fact that the Shanghai Volunteers are not yet  sufficiently strong  to  protect the  Settlement without the assistance of regular troops.  In this connection, while I am prepared to admit that much useful  work has been performed by the local forces in Shanghai,  I must point out that, since the arrival of the Defence  Force  in  China, a  considerable  lethargy seems  to  have  come over the Shanghai Volunteers.  In spite of  the crisis in the  Settlement, returns show no  appre- appreciable increase  in  the  strength  of the corps  ;  and,  although  Major-General Wardrop&apos;recommendation for an  increase   in the establishment  of  the Volunteers  has been accepted by the Municipal Council, it seems  that no advance in the organization for the self-defence of the  Settlement is likely to be made until it  is realized that the regulartroops are  about to  be  withdrawn.  I think it is high time  that  we  should make allconcerned  realize that there is a limit beyond which the British Army should not be calledupon to shoulder the burden of the defence of the Shanghai Settlement.

2China is not likely to reach real stability  or very many years to come, and  the  longerwe defer our decision to reduce  or to remove our troops, the longer, I fear, will the localauthorities defer making adequate arrangements for their own protection.     7.  After carefully  weighing all considerations, I  am  of the opinion that, providedconditions in China do  pot  deteriorate   in  the meantime, two further  battalions  canbe withdrawn at the end of the  current trooping season.  If this proposal is approved,the garrison of China at the end of next March will  consist of six battalions (one Indian),and until such time as the  Shanghai  Volunteer Corps is  in a position  to  guarantee  theinternal security of the Settlement unaided, a proportion of this force must unavoidably beretained at Shanghai.  The temporary distribution that I recommend after the withdrawalof these two battalions is as follows :                    Tientsin    ...     ...    ...     ...  2 battalions.                     (Detachments at  Peking  and Wei-hai-Wei.)                   Shanghai   ...     ...    ...      ...  2 battalions.                   Hong  Kong       ...    ...      ...  2 battalions.                                                       (1 Indian.)     The two battalions at Shanghai will subsequently go to Hong Kong.     8.  Of the two battalions to be withdrawn if this proposal is approved, one, which onlyleft this country for Shanghai on the 13th instant, wall be  stationed at  Malta  ; the otherwhich is in India under orders to proceed to China at an early date, will be stationed at gibraltar.  It will save about  32,000  if the former can be diverted en route to Malta,and about  10,000 if the  latter is brought direct from India to Gibraltar.   I therefore askfor a very early  decision, and in the meantime I have given instructions for the battalionwhich has already sailed to be stopped at Malta.
