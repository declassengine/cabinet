[This Document  is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.;                     Printed for the Cabinet.,   December 1928.SECRET.CP. 402 (28).   &apos;                          &apos;\, .                              .    -                INDIAN  STATUTORY  COMMISSION.Suggested  Invitation to  the Indian Central  Committee to visit                       England next summer.       MEMORANDUM BY TOE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.    I  circulate, for the consideration  of  my, colleagues,  correspondence which  has passed between Sir John Simon, the Viceroy and myself.   1 he former  strongly urgesthat he should be authorised to invite the members of the Indian Central Committee,which is co-operating with the  Statutory Commission in its present enquiry in India,to come to England at a convenient time  next summer.   The  purpose of  their visitwould be to attend the further  sittings which the Statutory Commission will no doubthold in this country for the purpose of hearing further evidence.    Sir John&apos;s purpose,  it will  be seen, is  partly psychological, to  hearten his Indiancolleagues in the face of the opposition which they have  experienced  and are likelyto experience iu the near future ; and  partly political, in order, if possible, to induceat the last moment certain  of the non-co-operating party  to co-operate  with  theStatutory Commission.                                                       &quot;&quot; ,    Sir John Simon&apos;s suggestion is one that in any case  1 should not feel  myself at liberty to adopt without  the  concurrence  of my colleagues in the Cabinet,  if only forthe reason that its  adoption will  Involve the extension of the  hospitality  of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to the members of the Indian Central Committee.    My telegram of the 14th December to the Viceroy indicates  the grounds On which sir John Simon&apos;s  proposal  might be  objected to  or criticised.   The Viceroy, in his reply of the 10th  December, does not oppose the suggestions which I  put forward forconditions which  would render the  suggested visit innocuous; and he  definitelyagrees with me that the concession, if made, should not be used  by  Sir John Simonas a  bait to induce any of the boycotting  party (such  as the  two  gentlemen  hementions; to co-operate at the eleventh hour.    With the concurrence of my colleagues I  propose to reply to Sir John Simon, whois anxious to have  a  very early reply,  that he may make  to the members of  theIndian Committee  the  announcement which  he  suggests  in  his telegram  of  the8th December.  In doing so, I  should stipulate that he should make  it clear privately to the members that the date of their  visit must depeud  on the  date of the GeneralElection  here, and that the final  invitation would  be  for them to arrive in Englandat a time when the members  of the Statutory Commission are about to resume theirsittings.   I should also advise Sir John to endeavour to manoeuvre the Indian central committee into agreeing to write its  Report here, and, if possible, even to agree topresent its Report to the Statutory Commission before the latter&apos;s is drafted.  I shouldalso make it plain that the Committee  must be warned  that they will be afforded no opportunity in the final joint sittings iu this country to  take  any part  in framing  theStatutory Commission^ Report.  Finally, I should  indicate to Sir John that, for  thereasons given in my telegram of the 14th  December, in  which  the Viceroy concurs,His Majesty&apos;s Government  are opposed  to any attempt to  recruit the assistanceof any members of  the opposition, even if the prospect of  an invitation to Englandseems  likely to be sufficiently attractive  to them to make  them desert from theirpresent position.   17th December 1928.                                                 PEEL.&apos;   Extract from letter from Sir John Simon to Lord Peel, dated 26th November J02S.   Two important questions affecting  the future course of  our inquiry have arisen onwhich I should like to consult you.  The first is referred  to  in the enclosed  Note of 5th November of an  interview I. had at Lahore with  three  members  of  the Indian^Central Committee.  It  seems  to  me  extremely important  to  give  -the&apos; members      3330   75  12.28
of the  Central Committee  all the  help  we. can  in  maguifying  their office  and status, and I feel that their wish  to come to England and  join; us  in bearing some evidence there this  summer is not unreasonable,   Those of  them who are membersof the Legislative Assembly will have to face a General Election in-12 months&apos; time(unless the Governor-General extends the life of-the Assembly under section 63D (1) (6)of the  Government of India Act), and.they;are likely, to be exposed to a fierce attack by the Congress Party, so that anything which improves their .position would be helpful. Moreover, they naturally feel that it  is not quite fair to invite them to make aReport without hearing- what may be said by selected witnesses from the India Officeand  others  at  home.  As  you will see from the Note, I told  them  that I should be opposed to  their coming to England to pursue a roving inquiry of their own.   Butray own feeling is that it might be a very useful tiring for them to come to England,.not when we return in April (for, I suppose,  a General Election may be  impending),but  a little later, so as. to sit with us in conference for four or five weeks, whenevidence from the  India Office,  perhaps  from the War Office,  and even from, someex-Governors  and ex-Viceroys,  might  be heard.  Then they could return, probablytaking  the  Continent  of  Europe  on  the way,  and devote themselves in India toframing such Report as they may be able to  agree upon.  I  should think it extremely doubtful that they could  agree, but  that does not  seem  to be.your affair or mine.What I should like  to know from  you  is whether you would  approve of this sort of scheme, and 1  realise  that you may  wish to consult the Cabinet.   The more I thinkover it, the more I see  its advantages.   It has become a matter of  high public policy to secure that  the  members  of  the Indian Committee should  stand  high in  theestimation of &quot;Their fellow  countrymen, and  they deserve our  backing because theyhave had enough pluck to resist the boycotters.  I think too that several of  them are becoming deeply impressed with the inherent difficulties  of  applying the  simpleformula that  India  should  now  have complete  self-government,  and  thus their considered view may well turn out to be in significant contrast to the Nehru Report,and may become an important rallying ground for more moderate Indian  opinion.They would, I think, be immensely encouraged  if,  for  example, they were receivedby the  King and suitably entertained  in official quarters;  on  the other hand, theywould be greatly strengthened by coming  into actual contact&apos;with responsible leadersof the Labour Party, and by seeing on the spot that extremism about India  in Britaindoes not cut not much  ice.-:  If you and the Cabinet  were disposed to favour  this idea, I  hope you.  would thinkit. well to,give me the  opportunity, after consulting the Viceroy,, of suggesting how the announcement should  be  made, and when..  What is  in my mind is  that if  thematter was adroitly handled at this end  there is a  possibility  of getting over to;  our side  some ot&apos;  those  who are at present standing aloof.  For  example,  the bait ofbeing added to the Committee when it  is  known  that the Committee is going toEngland to take evidence might prove  irresistible  to men like Jayakar  and Jinnah,and as  I have to preside  over a Conference of 23  I  do  not very much  mind if  thenumber is increased to 25 ; indeed, leaving  out  the Provincial Committee, the flockis reduced to 14. -  I am repeating this portion of  my  letter  to the Viceroy to savetime, and am also sending  him a copy of my  Note of 5th November.                                    Annexure.&apos; -  (Confidential.)                                           5th November 1928,   A  deputation,  consisting of Sir  Ilari Singh Gour, Sir Arthur Froom,  and  SirZulfiqar Ali Khan, came to see me this  niorning and raised the questions (I) whetherthe Central Committee would  have the opportunity  of coming to England with us inApril, or  later in the year, with  a view to hearing evidence  there bearing on theenquiry; (2) whether  by coming  to  England the Central Committee would  not  beable to get into touch with us in the later stages of our work  so as to give or receivehelp  on the subject-matter of the report ;   and (3) whether  the  Central Committeewould have the right or opportunity of appearing before the Joint  Committee of bothHouses of Parliament.   I said  that as  regards (3) the matter was manifestly  not one which  I or  theCommission could decide.   Strictly speaking, the only body that could decide it wasthe Joint Committee when it was constituted, and.  this , would not be until a new parliament had been elected in Britain.,  It was  doubtless for this reason that  theannouncement  made by Mr. Baldwin and the Viceroy Was  couched in vague terms and  spoke of &quot; deputations,&quot; including one from  the Central Legislature.   1 said L
*quite  appreciated  that those : who  had resisted &apos; the boycott  and  supported  -the; Commission, and  who  now  compose the Central Committee, had  run some political risk, and  were naturally  anxious  lest they should  be first denounced  as unrepre--sentative of Indian  opinion and then  set on one side by the Central Legislature choosing a different deputation.-  All I could say was that I personally  had  these-difficulties fully in mind and felt sure that they would be sympathetically considered when the time came, as far as possible.  I expressly stipulated  that what I said&apos;was not to be regarded as anything more than an expression of nry personal understanding-of their, difficulty, and of my-wish to be  helpful in any way I could.   But the matter was not, one which anybody could decide at present,  and in  any  case not  one which I had to decide.   The deputation ^seemed quite satisfied with this assurance.     ..(;&apos;&quot;    As regards (1) and (2) I repeated  in plain terms that there cotdd be no question of the  Report of the Commission being drawn up by anyone except the members of the-Statutory Commission.  -We were authorised by the King  to make a Report and we Were, therefore, bound  to present our conclusions to  His Majesty before they became known to anyone else.  I added that it was  too early in  the history of  the  Joint Conference to determine  yet  how far by informal  conferences  with the Central-Committee from time to  time we.  might be able to thrash  out special subjects, and that 1 hope we might find many opportunities for conference.   For example, I have-already asked  the lawyer members of the Conference (Suhrawardy, Gour,  Dr. Gokal Chand, and Chaudhri Zafrullah  Ivhan) to meet me one evening after  the Conference has  risen for  a talk  about the &quot;separation of  executive and jtidicial powers,&quot; after which  1  propose to write a  short  memorandum which can  be circulated  to all members-of  the Conference.   In the same way, I am seeing the Financial  Secretary of the Punjab Government with one or two others on  another night this week.   Thus I hope we may develop a system  by which we can help  one another,  in informal conference between  ourselves, to analyse, and perhaps to formulate, possible solutions-on various points  of  difficulty.   It-was-even possible  that  before we came to the end-of our work we might try tor-formulate  the main questions to  be decided; but  the answers to fundamental matters will have to  be  expressed in  a  Report which we could not show in draft to  the  Central Committee.    As regards coming to England with, a view to hearing further evidence, I pointed-out  that it seemed improbable that the members of the Statutory Commission  would be  engaged from day to  day in taking  further evidence as soon  as we  returned to England.  A  General  Election  was  impending at home  and we were  likely to be otherwise  occupied.  Sir  Arthur Froom expressed his opinion that it would serve no useful  purpose for  the Central  Committee to  come  home  with the idea of getting further information themselves,  without  necessarily  sitting with us.   I  agreed that 1 did not think this would turn  out  in practice to be a very fruitful course.   They would find themselves besieged  by all sorts of people, many of whom were not really representative or important, and would  be  in danger of  being  made the  target of journalistic and  partisan  enterprise.  Sir Arthur  concurred in this, but said  at  the same time that it would add greatly to the prestige of the Central  Committee if this body could come  to England for a short time.  There will be a  General  Election for the  Legislative Assemblj- in November, and if the Committee could come to England for  a short time before that with a definite programme to fulfil  along with  ourselves this would, he thought, greatly  help them in  the estimation  of the  Indian public^ I said that I would gladly consider, later on, whether there  might be useful work for the  Central Committee and the Commission  to do  together in  England, but  that I felt it was too soon to reach even a  jn-ovisional  decision.    The interview closed with  my saying that  I was  glad that  they had raised these points with me, and I felt  deeply-interested in  helping them in every way 1 could to maintain and  improve their  status as an  authoritative Indian body, and that later on in the tour I hoped  it might be  possible to be more  definite.  As  yet, it  took me all my  time to  arrange for  our  sittings for a month or two  ahead,  and I thought we should  be in a much better position to decide -what.should  be done after.the tour was over when we had worked  side by side a little longer. J. S.        Telegram from Indian Statutory Commission, dated Sth December 192S.    Private and personal.   Very confidential.   Following from Simon :       Please refer to my private letter of 20th November, Avhich should be just reachingyou.  It would be a great  help if you found it  possible  to  deal  at once by telegraph with the proposals that the  Indian Central Committee should come to England next
 summer.   The  pressure of the . boycotters. on  tliem is growing in intensity, and  it is becoming really important to strengthen their position  and improve their  status in the eyes of India.  In a fortnights time the. annual meeting of the Congress  begins at Calcutta, and we shall also be in that  city ourselves,. so  denunciation of the Central Committee and social, pressure in  all its forms will then reach their climax.  Some of them arc feeling the strain already.  I  am convinced  that it would greatly hearten them  if  an  announcement  could  be  made somewhat  in  the  following  terms:  &apos; In order that the Indian Central Committee may take part in further  sittings of the Joint Free Conference, when the Statutory Commission returns to England and hears further  evidence there, the  Commission has  proposed  that  the members  of the Committee should visit England this summer;  His Majesty&apos;s Government  welcomes this suggestion, and  would be glad  to offer its hospitality to  the members of the Committee while they are in London.   It is probable that the further sittings of the Conference in London will take place in June  or July.&apos;   The  Viceroy has  informed me that the Government of India would certainly raise no objection to  the  proposed visit.&quot;                                          .           &apos;        Telegram from Secretary of State lo Viceroy,  dated 14th December 1928.    3016.  Private and personal.   Simon has acquainted yOu with his proposal that Central Committee should  visit England this summer in order to sit with Commission in  taking  evidence  and in conference as may be required.   Before I put  proposal before Cabinet,  I should be glad-to have your views.  Prlina  facie it has much to commend it, and I should be disposed to support it.  But one or two points occur -to me.  First, Committee should not  come, either  collectively  or  individually, before General Election, and it would be reasonable  to expect of them that they would not embark  on campaign of propaganda on subjects under  inquiry, though  this  could perhaps  not  be insisted  on.    Second, while  there would be   no  objection to Commission and Committee conferring  together, as  they are  doubtless doing now, it should be made quite clear that latter will have no hand in drafting former&apos;s Report,.. and Commission would need to  be  very careful to  give Committee no clue as to its probable recommendations. Third,  it would be great advantage if Committee could be  induced to remain here  to write  its  own  report,  though this might involve ratherlong visit.  Fourth,  at all events, concession of; visit  might perhaps  be used to induce Committee to undertake to produce  its report, in time for Commission to comment on it in theirs, although in view of  forthcoming elections in India this  might involve that Committee&apos;s report would be  somewhat of an  electioneering address.    Finally, Simon appears to  think that effect of  concession may be so great as to induce even Jinnah and Jayakar to wish  to be  added  to Committee.  I am quite certain- that I should have great difficulty in&apos;persuading my colleagues to agree to this or  in  supporting it myself.  Apart from manifest impropriety of asking two men to report who have  only  heard  half  the evidence, I doubt  whether  they carry enough weight to make their adherence a valuable political  asset, and I feel sure  that  effect would be deplorable on those who  have supported us loyally in face of  great odium. As  Cabinet will not  meet again for some time after Wednesday, I shall be grateful for- your comments not later than Monday.                 Telegram from Viceroy, dated  14th December 192S.            -    371 C.   Private  and  personal.   Simon has shown me  draft of. his  suggested1&apos; announcement which  he  has sent  3-011 in  letter  of&apos; 20th November, regarding the Indian  Central  Committee visiting England this  summer  to take part  in further- sittings of Joint Free Conference.   In this connection  please see my private letter of 1st November.  I agree with  Simon&apos;s  proposal, and think that it  would be useful if&quot; announcement could be made immediately.  Telegram from Chairman, Indian Statutory Commission,  dated 16lh December 1928.    Private and personal.   Follosving from Sjmon :-    &quot;My telegram of the  7th  instant.   Viceroy informs me  that  he has urged that. proposed  announcement   regarding  Indian  Central  Committee  should be  made immediately.  Members of the Committee approach  me almost daily on the  subject,. and my position in replying to them is becoming increasingly difficult, especially-as we- shall be  leaving here for Calcutta on-&quot;Wednesday.   A reply authorising me  to make--the announcement before we leave here &quot;would ease matters considerably.&quot;
                 Telegram from Viceroy, dated 16th December 1928.   381 C.   Private and personal.  Your private and personal telegram  dated 14thDecember, No. 3616, crossed my No.  371 of the  14th,  in which I said T agreed generally   with  Simon&apos;s  proposal and referred you to what I had said on this subject in my letter of  1 st November.   2. Following are my views on the specific points on which you ask my opinion.I have, of course, had no opportunity of discussing with  Simon or anyone else who  isin touch with the Indian Committee, and 1 can only therefore tell you how the matterstrikes me.   First.  Date of  Committee&apos;s arrival would no doubt be  matter withwhich Simon would deal on  the  ground that his own Commission will be necessarilybusy preparing for their own election. .  On the other  hand, the Indian committee may not unreasonably desire to avoid the monsoon, but, in this  case, I do not thinkthat there would be any difficulty in getting them to refrain from taking undesirablepart in  propaganda.   They are all good friends  of the Government.   Second.Simon has  already made it plain  that his Report  must be his own,  and he couldreiterate this  to the  Committee if general proposal is approved.  Third and fourth.I should  not like to predict, for certain, whether the Committee would be ready  toAvrite report in England, but Simon might be able to manage it if he agreed.   As regards the question of Indian elections to which you incidentally refer, Iwould ask you  to keep your mind open, as I may decide to recommend  postponementafter discussion I hope to  have with Simon and the  Council this month.  Finally.I have  already told  Simon I do not think that there is the least likelihood of visithome at  this  stage  having effect he deems possible on Jirmah and Jayakar.  Nor,even if he did, should I be prepared to recommend it in the present circumstances forthe same  reason as vours.3880
