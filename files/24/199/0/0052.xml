[This Document is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government. ]Rebellion of the  Tribes of Eastern Afghanistan.&apos;MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   My colleagues  will have  read in the Press reports  of  serious  disturbances in eastern Afghanistan during the  past  three or four weeks.   .1. now circulate for their information two telegrams, one from  the Government of India, dated 12th December,and one from Sir Francis Humphrys, of the same date, giving their appreciation ofthe immediate situation.    It may be convenient to give  a short  resume of  the events preceding the outbreakof the revolt.                                   *   The first news  of  active resistance to the King&apos;s  reforming  policy was a report,dated  10th  September,  from  Sir  F.  Ilumphrys of  the  arrest  of two Plazrats-who were  on their  way  from  Kabul to Khost with a  manifesto signed by 40O1Afghan mullahs  declaring the  King&apos;s  westernising policy  to  be  contrary to theprecepts  of Islam,  Sir Francis Humphrys  stated  at the time  that the movement,of which  this  manifesto  was the  symptom, was  serious.  The King pursued hisOccidental policy by appointing  a Prime  Minister;   the immediate  result  wasthe resignation of his  two principal advisers,  Alohamecl  Wali  Khan and GhulamSadiq ;  no one, however, being willing to accept  the new post of Prime Minister,these two  Ministers  returned to the  Government.   On the 5th October  the  King-completed  an address of  11 hours&apos;  duration to a &quot;representative&quot; gathering atKabul on his general policy, which included the  compulsory wearing of  European    &apos;&quot;*  A.dress and the co-education of  boys and girls  in Kabul from  the  ages of ii to 11.  Onthe 17th November the Government of India reported that traffic  between  Dakka andJalalabad had been interrupted by disturbances iu which the Mohrnands and ShinwarisAVERE  concerned.  These disturbances seem  to have arisen  in the  first place out of inter-sectional fighting  over  land disputes amongst the Afghan Mohmands ; at thesame time  an Afghan bandit carried out in  the neighbourhood  of Charikar a  series-of depredations, to check  which Afghan regular troops  were  despatched without,success.  The result of these simultaneous causes of disturbance has been that  sincethe middle of  November there  has  been considerable  sporadic fighting  betweenrebellious  tribesmen  and  irregular  Afghan  Levies around Jalalabad, Dakka  andCharikar,   and traffic  between   Kabul  and  India  has been   almost  completelyinterrupted.  Against the  advice of  Sir F.  Humphrys,  King  Amanulla  employedaircraft manned by  Russians to bomb  the  Shinwari  tribesmen on  two occasions,a proceeding  which no doubt exacerbated their hostility to the King.   The Mohmandsin the meantime were kept to some extent in  hand  hy the influence  of the Mullah ofChaknaur,  a  prominent Mohmand spiritual leader who in 1915  was in arms againstthe British, and in 1919 took the Afghan side against the  British.  He is reported tobe heavily subsidised from Kabul to keep the  Afghan Mohmauds in hand.   As will be seen from  the Government of India&apos;8 telegram,  the disturbances in afghanistan have not  affected  the tribes on our side  of  the frontier in any markeddegree.  But both the  Government of India  and  Sir F. Mnmphrys anticipated thatthe prestige of the Kings Government would emerge severely shaken by this rebellionthough Sir Francis Humphrys limited his forecast of events  to the immediate futureonly.   (The Government of India&apos;s telegram refers to  the  King&apos;s potential rivals in theMusahiban or Sultan Mohammed Khan family, of whom the most  prominent memberis Nadir Khan, who was Afghan  Commander-in-Chief in the war of J919, was AfghanMinister in Paris in 1926 and  is now  in  retirement at Grasse owing  to ill-health.  Itis worth notice  that Nadir Khan and his In-other  Hashim Khan, who was formerlyAfghan Minister in Moscow, have requested an interview with a representative of theBritish Government, and have expressed their intention to return  to Afghanistan.)   Taking advantage  of the pacifying influence of the Mullah of Ghaknaur among theAlohmands, it appears that King  Amanulla, possibly as a result, of  advice tendered by3333    75  12.2S
Sir F. Humphrys, sent Ghulam Sadiq, bis Acting Foreign Minister, to parley with theShinwaris, the other principal element in the disturbances.  As the last sentence ofthe  Government  of India&apos;s  telegram  of 12th  December indicates,  Ghulam Sadiqappears to have been successful in arranging a 10 days&apos; truce.    The latest reports, however, indicate that this truce  has  led to nothing and  the telegram  from His  Majesty&apos;s  Minister,  No. 214  of 16th December, of which also Icirculate a copy, indicates that the tribesmen immediately surrounding Kabul havebeen suddenly infected with the spirit of revolt and are attacking the city with some success.   The situation for King Amanulla,  and possibly for  the British Legation,appears  to be serious.  It will be seen from the Government  of  India&apos;s telegram ofthe  17th  December  that  they are  making such  arrangements  as  are possible to evacuate the Legation staff by air if the emergency arises.                                                                         PEEL.    17th December 1928.   Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State                          for India, 12th December 1928.   2782 S.   Amanulla&apos;s  proceedings since his return from  grand tour have been followed here with growing concern.   As we- see it here, loyalty  of tribes has now given way under the  intolerable  strain  imposed hy what they cannot  but regard asmadness on the part of the King.   It is only the appeal of Ghazi&apos;s personality  andachievements, apart from  his blind zeal for reform, to Afghan patriotism and nationalvanity, that has hitherto induced them to acquiesce  in  the  unprecedented  measureswhich  would  long  since have   cost  any ruler  of. less dominating character histhrone.    King seems deliberately to have discarded almost every  other  weapon,including the support  qfthe discontented army, before entering the contest,  and it isdifficult to see how he  can emerge without surrender of most that  he  stands for, andconsequently crippled  of his personal prestige and that of his government.  To crushthe rebellion ou the present issues  with dispirited cr disaffected troops seems, asthe Minister evidently feels,  out of the question  and only  compromise  remains.Conservative leaders  are scarcely likely now to  wish  locus  pamitentioz  short ofvirtually  complete  abandonment  of  reforms.   Failure  of King to profit by  lessontaught by Khost rebellion must, in their eyes stamp him as incorrigible.   Should the result  be- dethronement, it  seems unlikely that the rebels  will lookbeyond  Muhammadzai for the successor, or that any violent change  in  the existing system of government will follow.   Revolt is not so much against the existing politicalorder of things as  against the violent upsetting of  the whole social system to whichAmanulla has committed  himself.   It  might fairly be  described rather  as a counterrevolution than revolt.  If a new king is to  be  set  up, present indications point to arespectable but colourless  clerical nominee like Inayatulla.&quot;:::&apos;   Balance of probabilitiesseems to be against  successor of this kind embarking on pronouncedly anti-british policy.   Causes which compelled Amaimlla to  this  course,  in 1919, viz., necessity to turn  eyes of the tribes  outwards and to  disarm clerical suspicion,  together withmodernist nationalist impulse,Would be absent.  Any pronounced success or spread of the  revolt  might,  however, lead  to the disintegration of  Afghanistan  by theprovinces declaring their own separate independence.  Such  a movement, if combined with  ltussian  exploitation, might bring  us appi-eciably nearer situation envisaged  inrecent, discussions on the defence of India.   Direct evidence of  intrigue and personal ambition as a cause of  the revolt is so farlacking.  Among the rebels proper, no big name has yet  come to the  fore.  Thatthis is so, is no  doubt partly due to the fact that the King has removedunost dangerouspotential rivals,  Nadir Khan, the only frontier expert and perhaps  only first-classbrain of the Afghan Government and his  popular  brothers of great  Musahibau.family.   As regards  the situation  among our tribes, it is truism that trouble for the Amirusually  spells trouble for ourselves.  But, for the moment, the  Afghan commotion seems likely to spell temporary quietness for our frontier, where, at present, the attitude of the tribes as a whole is exceptionally friendly.  We are happily hitherto less identified than                           * Half-brother, of King Amairalla.
                                         o                                         o:any other  nation  represented  at Kabul with  odius  western innovations.  Indeed,Baluchistan reports that favourable comparisons are beginning to be drawn between british tolerance  and  new-fangled Kabul intolerance of religious  and  Customarypractices.  We must, however, though hitherto there have been no signs of this, bearin mind possibility of Russian endeavours to misrepresent us as villians  of the piece.    Danger of our tribes seriously embarrassing us by embroiling themselves in revoltseems at present small.  Their sympathy must be against reforms, but as Boltonremarks,  they have) permanent pro-Kabul bias which may  reasonably  be trustedto  keep them from  risking anything by intervening.   Pinch of. reforms  shoe  is notafter  all directly felt on this side of Durand  line.  There  seems therefore reason to hope  that under  guidance of Chief Commissioner and his officers  our tribes  will-cause us no serious embarrassment on this score.    Attitude of powerful Ghilzai nation which, even  more than that of  Mohmands,may  prove decisive factor, is at present uncertain.  Season is in favour of King, forGhilzais  are  generally  loth  to  commit themselves when  important  part  of their strength  is in  India;  at any  rate  unless  they have reason to hope  for British; sympathy.    Question of rendering assistance  to British and  possibly  to other Legations  hiKabul is receiving our most  anxious consideration.  This matter is being dealt  with separately.    Separate reference will also be made on question of attitude to be adopted towardspossible request by Amanulla for active assistance.    As this issues, North-West Frontier reports declaration of 10 days1 truce.    Telegram from His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul, 12th December 1928.   My estimate of the situation is as follows :    Shinwari  rebellion, is  due to anger at the  King&apos;s reforms which are held  to  be contrary to tribal customs and to the tenets  of Islam as expo uncled by the Afghanmullahs.   Sympathy with the cause for which the rebels are fighting is so strong throughoutthe country that the rebellion cannot be extinguished by force, more especially  as theonly real force at the King&apos;s disposal resides in the tribal levies.  Afghan regulararmy is untrained, miserably paid  and equipped, and  unable,  even if willing, to stand up against  tribesmen.   Operations  of  the Air Force  strictly limited as theymust be, produce the same result as  a stick thrust into a wasp&apos;s nest.   Advice given to the King by the Soviet Embassy and, in the first instance, by theTurkish Ambassador, was to fight to the bitter end  to impose the newr reforms on  his people.  If Amanulla follows, this advice, I have no doubt whatever that he will bedethroned.  This  is probably what the Russians desire or, at&apos;any rate, that the King-shall be so weakened that he will be a mere tool in their hands.   I have impressed on the King and his Ministers from the first that their ODiy hope-of success lay in securing the co-operation  of  the religious leaders to parley with the rebels  and explaining away  in  a   sympathetic  spirit the  doubts and  fears  (two-corrupt groups) of the tribesmen.   It appears that  a  truce  will  be arranged at last for  discussing terms.  These are said  in high quarters to include a  demand  for-expulsion of all Turks from Afghanistan.    This much seems certain.   King will  have to humble himself and eat his words.    Nothing less  than the  vindication, of their religious and customary rights willsatisfy the tribesmen, and if the King fails to allay their suspicions on. this score,  the rebellion will  spread and will  overwhelm  the  present  dynasty  within  the  nextJew  months.     Telegram from His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister, Kabul, 16th December 1928.    214.   15th  December.   Fighting  has  continued  all  day.   Tribesmen  have-captured  two  important posts overlooking Kabul with  large  stock  of rifles andammunition  and are expecting considerable reinforcements to-morrow morning from&quot;Tagao and the eastern provinces.   When these arrive they will probably try to  stormthe two remaining forts and finally the palace.
   Tribesmen bave apparently killed  three Turkish officers already, and state thatthey do not propose to leave a single male Turk or Russian alive.   We are all safe and well (up to 10 p.m., 15th December) but communication withother Legations and  city is cut off.*   King is still  at the Palace.   Soldiers are saidto be deserting en masse, only officers remaining loyal.   Three aeroplanes,, piloted by Russians, went up to-day from  Shampur and bombed the tribesmen.               The new British Legation building is about two miles from the City.Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to His Britannic Majesty s- Minister at Kabul, and repeated to Secretary of State for India, with  December 1928.   2839 S.   Katodon 214.   Please telegraph whether you agree to our sending  up-forthwith three DH/9/AO carrying light  transmitting set with  officer to  instal set,..mechanic and operator.   If immediate neighbourhood of Kabul  is impossible, cannot you suggest  some-place,  say in  Ghazni,^ where machines  could  land  and  pick up  passengers  atprearranged time.                      f  About 90 miles by read south-west of Kabul.
