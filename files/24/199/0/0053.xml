Sir,             I am directed by Lord Cushendun to transmit to you,        herewith,  copy of a note from the United States Ambassador        from  which it  will be observed that the American Battle        Monuments  Commission desire  to erect in Gibraltar a monument        to commemorate the activities ox the United States navy  in        neighbouring waters during the period of United States        participation  in the war.             2,   while Lord Cushendun is not aware  that the United        States Navy suffered any special losses or  performed any        particular feats in the  waters adjacent to  Gibraltar,  he is        strongly of opinion that the  proposal of the  American Battle        Monuments  Commission should be welcomed and he  presumes        in these circumstances,  and in view of the  possibly        unfortunate political repercussions of any  attempt to  place        obstacles  in their- way,  that  Mr.  Secretary  Amery will agree        to an affirmative  reply  being returned to Mr. Houghtonxs note.             3.   In requesting that Lord Cushendun  may  be furnished        at an early date with any  observations which Mr.  Amery may        desire to  offer  on this  question,  I am to enquire whether in        the event  of its being agreed that permission should be        granted  to the American  Battle  Monuments Commission to        proceed  with their plans,  there would be any objections  to        their being advised to communicate direct on matters  of        detail with the  Governor of Gibraltar.             4.  Similar letters are  being sent  to  the  Admiralty and        War Office.                                I am etc.the Under  Secretary of State            (SSI))  3.M. SHOW.   Colonial Office.

London, October 3rd, 192 8.         My Lord:              Under instructions of my Government I have the honour         to inquire whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing         to approve a proposal of the American Battle Monuments         Commission to ereot in Gibraltar a memorial to commemorate         the activities of the American Navy during the World War in         waters adjacent to Gibraltar.              The American Battle Monuments Commission was created by         Act of Congress approved March 4th,  1923, for the purpose of         erecting memorials in Europe to  commemorate the services of         American forces abroad during the World ?/ar.  Its Chairman,         General John J. Pershing,  has advised the State Department that         the plans of the Commission include  the erection in Gibraltar         of a memorial costing approximately  twenty-five thousand         dollars ($259000).              In the event of His Majesty1 a Governments giving its         approval to the project, I  have  the  honour to inquire  whether         there would be any objection on  the  part  of the British         authorities to the Commission^  communicating directly with         the local authorities in Gibraltar concerning the  details  in         connection with the  erection of  the  memorial,  with the         understanding that the  plan finally  prepared will  be subject         to the approval of the  appropriate authorities of  His  Majesty Ts         Government.

A representative ox the American Battle Monuments         Commission visited Gibraltar early this year and  was         inclined to think that a clock tower on the Promenade  near         the Bristol Hotel would be the most suitable form of         memorial. .  The Colonial Government were, however,  invited         to offer any suggestions that might occur to them with         regard to the  form of monument and the  Consulting Architect         to the Government produced a sketch of  a Memorial Arch         which he suggested might be  acceptable.   The Commission have         now asked for  a proper drawing of  this  Arch which is being         prepared for them.         3.     On looking into this  matter, it  occurred to  me  that         it might be  possible to erect a monument on the lines  of         the American War Memorial in Edinburgh, which takes the  form         of an American soldier looking up  at the Castle.    I have         always.been much impressed by this monument and I feel that         if the Memorial Arch suggested by  the  Consulting  Architect         were  surmounted, by the figure of an American sailor looking         up at the Rock or looking out over the  waters patrolled         by the United  States Navy during the war,  it  would  make  a         very  dignified and impressive Memorial.2HE RIGHT HONOURABLE    L.S.AMERY, U.P..       etc., etc., eto.                  5.
4.   Needless to say, whatever form of monument isultimately decided on by the Commission, they may restassured that they will be granted every possiblefacility by this Government and there is of course noobjection to their continuing to communicate direct with me as they have done in the past.

Sir,                    With  reference to  the  letter from this Department          of the 27th October,  I am directed by  Mr.  Secretary Amery          to transmit to  yon, to be laid  before  the  Secretary of State          for Foreign Affairs,  a copy  of a despatch  from the Governoraf.6th Nov.of Gibraltar, regarding the  prox^osal to erect in Gibraltar          a monument to commemorate the activities of the  United States          Navy in neighbouring  waters  during the war.               2.   So far as this Department is concerned, there          is no objection to an affirmative reply being sent to the          enquiry contained in  the note from the United States          Ambassador of the 3rd of October, a copy of which accompanied          your letter (No.A6952/6952/45) of the  17th of October, and          the proposal that the -American Battle  Monuments  Commission          should communicate direct with the Governor  of Gibraltar in          the matter appears to be equally unobjectionable.               3.   A copy of this letter  is being sent to the          Governor of Gibraltar, the Admiralty and War Office.

Sir,                     I have  the  honour  to transmit  to  you           for your information,  copies of the  papers  noted           below on the subject  of  the  proposal to  erect  In           Gibraltar a monument  to  commemorate  the  activities           of  the United States  Navy  in neighbouring waters           during the war.

       Sir,                 I am commanded by the Army Council to       acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. A.6952/5952/45,       dated 17th October, 1928, forwarding&apos; a copy of a; note from       the United States Ambassador on the subject of the       erection in Gibraltar of a monument to commemorate the       activities of the United States Navy in neighbouring       waters during the Great War.            2.   In reply, the Council wish to state that, whilst       they appreciate lord Cushendunrs natural anxiety that       the American proposal should be welcomed on political       grounds, they feel that the promoters of this proposal       have paid insufficient consideration to British military       sentiment in the matter.            3.   The monuments which have, in the past, been-       erected to commemorate the deeds of the British Navy and       Army are invariably dedicated to the memories of those       who laid down their lives for their country in the       achievement of these deeds.   The erection of a monument,       therefore, on British soil whose main object is to       commemorate the bloodless feats of American sailors,  the       very great majority of whom must be alive to-day, can       hardly arouse in the breasts of those who gaze upon it       the feelings which its designers presumably wish to exoite.       The British soldier is under no illusions as to- the       relative part played by the two Nations in the Great  War,The Under Secretary of State,        Foreign Office.fviii )0153/5105.  fM.0.1)&apos;.CONFIDENTIAL.14th November 1928.
and the erection of a monument of this  description,especially on a historic site lilre  the  Rock  of  Gibraltar,which is replete with glorious traditions  of both  theBritish Navy arid Army, will, the Council fear, be  a  subject for ridicule rather than for respect,     4.   Copies of this latter hare been  sent  to admirality and Colonial Office.                              I am, etc.,                                  (SGI)) H.J. GREEDY.

Sir,  -                  .                    I am directed by lord Gushendun to acknowledge          receipt of your letter 0153/5105.(M.0.1)  of November          14th. last regarding the desire of the American Battle          Monuments Commission to erect In Gibraltar a monument.          commemorating the ?/ar*-time activities of the United          States Navy in adjacent waters and in reply to state          that, while fully appreciating the reasons which have          inspired the opinions expressed by the Army Council,          he feels unable to agree that the application received          through the United States  Government could properly          be refused on these grounds.               2.   It is true that, as the xlrmy Council states,          British military memorials are consecrated to commemor-          ating those who have fallen in the service of their          country, but Lord Cushendun does not consider that this          fact can be advanced to the United States  Government          as an adequate reason for  refusing permission for the          erection of a commemorative monument of another          description.   Moreover, it will be appreciated that          the memorial proposed by the  American Battle Monuments          Commission will, when erected, constitute  a  permanent          record of Anglo&quot;American comradeship-In-arms and that,          whatever may be the precise motives underlying the          United States proposal,  it is un undeniable  fact that          American participation in  the war not only contributed          greatly to its successful  prosecution,  but was  warmlyThe Under-Secretary of State,       War Office.                                   12.
welcomed at the  time.   Lord Cushendun does not understand why a monument commemorating Anglo-Amerioannaval co-operation at a time when the very existence ofthe British Empire was at stake should now be considered a subject for ridicule.     3..  The Army Council will, Lord Cushendun feels,readily appreciate that His MajestyTs Government cannotattempt to outline to the United States government thepolicy which they.should pursue in the matter of warmemorials.   This being so, the main issue involvedin this particular case is not so much whether theproposal of the American Battle Monuments commission may seem to be in good taste  but whether, as a matterof policy, His MajestyTs Government are prepared toadopt,  on a question of minor importance,  an attitude which,  in Lord Cushend.unIs opinion, might be expectedto have extremely unfortunate political -repercussions.     4.

  M. 4364/28.                            24th November,  1928.          Sir,               I am commanded by My Lords  Commissioners of          the Admiralty to inform you that They have  had under          consideration your  letter No.  A. 6952/6952/45 dated the          17th  October,  1928,  as to the  erection in Gibraltar          of a  monument  to commemorate the activities of the          United States  Navy  in neighbouring waters during the          period of United States&apos;  participation in the war.               2.  It will  be  remembered  that in 1926  a  proposal          was made  that  a  United States  Naval War Memorial          should be erected in  London.  Serious objections were          found to  the  proposal, and the United States  were          finally persuaded to  drop it.               In the present case  again there  is an  Insuperable          objection in  that there is no  British Naval War          Memorial at Gibraltar for our  own sailors killed in          the War;   it  would  be most undesirable, therefore,          to have  one for  any of the Allied Navies.               4.  A copy of this letter  has been sent to the          War  Office and the  Colonial Office.

His Excellency&apos;.s predecessor  has already  been approached by         the American  Consul here with regard to this  matter ,and         had taken the opportunity  cf  the presence in  Gibraltar         of  Mr. A.S..G. Butler, F.R.I.B.A.,  the Consulting Architect         to  this Government, to consult him as to  a suitable site         for- the memorial.  . I have the honour to  enclose a copy  of         a letter which has  just been received from Mr. Butler         together with two drawings of the s\iggested memorial  which         appear to me, subject to any view which your  Commission  may         hold, to be eminently suitable to the purpose for  which  it         is  intended.    I am directed  to add, however,, that it has         occurred to His  Excellency that the Memorial  might perhaps         be  improved by the  addition of the figure of  an American         sailor looking up at the Rock or looking  out  over  the         waters patrolled by the United States Navy during  the War.         His Excellency has  seen the American Y-ar  Memorial  in         Edinburgh which takes the  form of -an American soldier         looking up at the Castle and feels  strongly that  some suchThe Secretary,   The  American Battle Monuments Commission,       &apos;20 Rue  Molitor,            Paris,  XVle.

It is needless to add that the suggestions made in this letter are not intended in any way to rule out any other possibleform of Memorial which may seem suitable to yourCommission.   They have merely been made in response to the request made to His Excellency&apos;s predecessorby the American Consul that some indication should begiven to the Commission of the type of memorial whichwould be most suitable to this Government.                        I have, etc.,                          (Sd.) HUBERT YOUNG,                               Colonial Secretary.
                                                             29S                                       4 Francis Street,                                            Westminster, S.W.1.                                             November 15th, 1928.         Sir,              In reference to your letter of 17th July 1928,         I have the honour to send you two drawings of the         suggestion I made for the American Naval Memorial         at Gibraltar-              You will perhaps recollect that His Excellency         agreed with us that such a monument Incorporating a         flight of steps and a commenorative arch would be very         acceptable In lieu of the proposed clock tewer on the         itiles&apos; Promenade.   Steps at this point In the old         fortifications would be a great asset to the town and         the arch, built In the same stone as the walls, would         be of a more permanent character than the other         suggestion, as well as being, perhaps, more dignified.              You will observe that the design &quot;of the arch has         a certain severity which is essential to make it         harmonise with the battlements from which it grows.         It would depend for Its effect on delicately adjusted         proportions, related surfaces and the angles of the         various  splayed faces, as well as the ornament I have         indicated.   Each  elevation would close a vista from         either  direction,  which  is  so advantageous to  a monument.         The  character  of the design, such as  it is,  is based          on  similar work  done  In  the period  of Louis  XIV  in          French naval ports like  La  RochelleiThe Honorary Colonial Secretary,      Gibraltar.
     The erection of this would involve removing the old magazine and a tank, but I understand thatwas possible.   The steps avoid the network of pipesbelow ground.                       I have,  etc.,                          (Sd.) A.S.G. BUTLER.
