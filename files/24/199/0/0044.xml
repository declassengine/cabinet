[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]      D i&apos;Jhk rw* Printed jof the Cabinet.,  :Deceniber 1928*.. .SECRET.                                &quot;&apos;,M&apos;;V&quot;&apos;    V Copy  No.8CP. 394 (28).                            CABINET.   THE CRUISER PROGRAMME, 1928-9.S         &apos;  _-        Memorandum by the  Chancellor of the Exchequer.    AT the Geneva Naval  Conference the Admiralty offered to agree toparity with the United States in 8-inch Gun Cruisers.   The foreign secretary  tells me that Mr.  Gibson,  the head  of  the United  states delegation there, had authority to state officially that  in  any ease  theUnited  States did  not intend  to  build more 8-inch Gun Cruisers thanGreat Britain.   I was unaware of  this  fact, and I  trust  Sir austen chamberlain will explain it more fully to the Cabinet.    2.  We now have to  settle  the question, how  is the Admiraltyprinciple of  parity with America in 8-inch Gun ships to be interpreted in1931?   Cruiser strengths in the financial year 1931 are governed  by thecurrent programmes of 1928-9. If we build now the two Cruisers forwhich money is provided in this year&apos;s Estimates, we should have  by theend of the financial year 1931 17 8-inch Gun ships plus the 4 Hawkins.The First Sea Lord agreed last  year that the 4 Hawkins should count asthe equals of  2 Japanese 8-inch Furutakas.   Therefore our 8-inch gunstrength by the end of the  financial year  1931 will be  17 4- 2 equivalents= 19.   As against  this the United States, after  accelerating 3 vessels,cannot  have more than 8.  On this basis our interpretation of  paritywould be 19 to 8.   If no  ships are built  this year it will  be  17 to 8.It is submitted that even the lower figure is a  generous interpretation ofthe  parity  which  the Admiralty have  declared  themselves  ready  toaccept.                                                             18614
  &apos;  3. : We have how to consider the position in 1932. i&apos;If the Americanslay down1 the-first 5 of&apos; the  15 ships &quot;now under discussion- the figure in&apos;1932 wbuidhe^JUi;^&apos;1&apos;,H&apos;l0 si-^o-Vq&amp;ing       ilnsu ioJ ,  -VIIA triads w--&apos;h A- fjir-v, biowrjol oti iVraj? afon-Bcf diodjidiv/ frmite wea  ft ac/J ari crwfr         United States     ....       ...  13         Great Britain     ...      ....  17   plus any ships we may build              .v.:                             in our programme of 1929,which again at the very least is a satisfactory form of equality.    4.  Japan  will have  in  1931  6 &quot;A&quot;  class  8-inch Cruisers  plus4 Purutakas; and  in 1932 8 &quot;A&apos;s &quot; and 4 Furutakas.  They announced at Geneva that they had no  intention of laying down  any other 8-inchgun cruisers before the  31st December, 1936.  Thus  in 1931,  if  our2 Cruisers this  year are  dropped,  the comparative  Cruiser  strength ofGreat Britain and Japan would be          Japan   ....       _____      .....  10         Great Britain     ....      ...  17and in 1932-         Japan   .....      ....       .....  12         Great Britain     ....           17   plus any ships we may build                                             in our programme of 1929.    It cannot therefore be said either that parity with the United states or the 5 : 3 ratio with Japan still  less British naval safety is  in any respect endangered by our  dropping the  2 Cruisers from this year&apos;programme.    5.  Since these matters were discussed early this year by the CabinetCommittee, the Kellogg Peace Pact has been signed.  Speaking at geneva on the llth September upon this, Lord Cushendun said:          &quot; What the  world chiefly needs  is not merely to  feel  greater    confidence but to  display it, and to that end the  great venture of    faith  entered  upon  in  Paris a  fortnight ago will give  a  great    stimulus.....   The  Paris  Pact  proclaims  a new  era.  .  ...    Armaments beyond what is prescribed for national  safety  will be    recognised as a costly and discreditable anachronism.&quot;    Speaking on the same subject at the Guildhall on the 9th November,the Prime Minister said :          &quot; In spirit every nation that signs that Pact has got to keep it    before its mind whenever it examines its own armaments; whenever    it prepares estimates of its own armaments it must 1&apos;ealise what the    implications of  that  Pact are .... the  alternative before  us  in    Europe is  very simple and the choice ought to be easy. We either
    keep faith&apos; with the spirit of thePaet that we have signed or, in time,   , we go down ra, steep place altogether like Gadarene swine and perish    eternally.  Let us all .... grasp this opportunity which has beeiij    given us for a new start with both hands and go forward with a new    faith and a new hope.&quot;                            r    6.   We have now to settle what  meaning is to be attached to theseMinisterial declarations.    The Cabinet should consider whether  dropping the  2 Cruisers  inquestion would not be a reasonable step to take.   Having regard to  ourpresent  enormous lead we can without  risk make this valuable concession to the cause  of Peace  and  Disarmament.   Such  an act  would be  animportant  contribution  on the  part  of  Great Britain and one whichluckily she can well afford to make.    7.   It  is for the  Foreign Secretary to say what effect a step of thiskind would produce upon  Anglo-American  relations.   The Cabinet  can judge for themselves how  it would be viewed by our own public opinion in this critical year.   I should myself think it would be helpful  in both directions.   It certainly would be very remarkable if Great Britain met anew American programme of 15 Cruisers by dropping 2  vessels from her own declax*ed series of  programmes.   Although no  doubt  the american naval Bill will pass, such a step on our  part would, it seems to me, veryprobably affect the rate at which these  vessels are constructed.    8.   It  would  seem wise to go  to  the  country with  a record of having, however slightly, reduced our  armaments  during our tenure.  Ihave asked the Fighting Services to aim at , 110 millions for 1929, i.e., areduction   of   4^  millions on  the  current  year&apos;s   Estimates  and 5$ millions on the  Estimates which the  Socialists  fathered.  Havingregard  to  the greater sense of  security in  the world, to the increasingacceptance of the League of Nations, and to the Kellogg Pact, as well asto the important decline in prices which has taken place, this is surelyabout the least we ought to do.   There are no means of procuring this reduction,  or anything  like it,  unless  these 2 Cruisers  are omitted.Dropping them will save   li millions on  the  armament expenditure of next year.   It  would  be very hard  to find  an  equal sum by extracurtailments of Army or Air Force expenditure beyond those in any casenecessary.    9.   There  remains  the question  of  the  effect of  dropping  the2 Cruisers upon  dockyards and upon  unemployment.   I do not  under-rate this,  but  it   lies  in an  altogether lower plane  of  nationalaction.  Dockyards must depend  on policy and  not  policy  on  dock-
   yards.  The re-fitting and re-conditioning of some  of our older Cruisers   would  raise  no international  issues  and might afford r.a .good deal of -  employment.  A higher price  might have to be accepted for guns  and1 r --gun&apos;&quot;mountingsf if  a reduced quantity were ordered.  But how can these   purely administrative and minor financial questions be weighed against the   main  issues of,:,putting  ourselves right with the world and with our own   countrymen oij Naval programmes and confronting the pacifist electorate   of the United States with the naked fact that they alone will be the great   Naval  expansionists.  How can this weigh  against  the  importance of a   Conservative Government presenting itself to the nation with a record of   reduced armaments expenditure justified by consolidated peace ?      .
