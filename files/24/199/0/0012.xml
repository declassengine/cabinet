                II POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.COAL MINING.    After a further  decline in employment during July there was some  improve-ment in  coal mining in the two subsequent months.  The improvement took theform of lessened short-time working, the percentage of  whole-time unemploymentin the coal mining industry being practically the same at the end of September asat the end of July.IRON  AND  STEEL.    In the iron and  steel trades employment was somewhat  slacker in Augustthan in July,  but it improved slightly during September, the output of steel being718,600 tons in the last mentioned month compared with 648,300 tons in August.In the tin-plate trade employment continued good on the whole during the first two months of the quarter, but there was some falling off in September.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.    Employment in shipbuilding became somewhat slacker during the quarter, theamount of tonnage under construction at the end of September being 1,089,760 tons as compared with 1,202,610 tons at the end of June.  Ship-repair work was, on thewhole, slack.ENGINEERING.    Little change took place in the unemployment position of the heavier branchesof the engineering  industry during the quarter.  In the lighter branches of thetrade an improvement occurred  in motor vehicle manufacture and constructionalengineering in September.TEXTILES.    Cotton. Employment in the cotton industry continued to be bad, particularlyin the American spinning section.  The slight reduction in unemployment during september was due mainly to the incidence of short-time working.    Woollen and Worsted. In the woollen and worsted industry employmentwas also bad during the quarter, much short-time being worked in all the principaldistricts.    Other  Textiles. Employment in the jute and hosiery trades continued good.In  the  silk trade there was  a  decline in  employment,  particularly during september.BUILDING.    Unemployment amongst certain classes of building workers, i.e., painters,showed the usual seasonal decline towards the end of the quarter, but, on thewhole, employment in  the  industry continued to be fair.  Weather conditions inSeptember were unusually good for outside work.
CLOTHING TRADES.    Apart from  the  usual  seasonal variations,  little change took place in thetailoring and clothing trades.  Some improvement in the boot and shoe trades set in during September.TRANSPORT, DOCK LABOUR AND SHIPPING SERVICES.    Employment in  transport and  shipping  services  showed,  on  the whole, adecline, whilst dock work was also slack.
     III. WORK  INSTITUTED  FOR  RELIEF  OF UNEMPLOYMENT.                               Numbers Employed.          [See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24)).]     The  table which follows has been prepared  to  show,  so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistancefrom the  Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.     Scope  of  Table. The  schemes  included  are  those  undertaken  by  local and  other Authorities  and  Public  Companies  with a  financial  contribution from  the  State   with  the  object   of  relieving  unemployment:  and  works in  respect of  which  guarantees  have been  given  under  the  Trade  FacilitiesActs  as   capital  undertakings   calculated   to  promote   employment  in  thiscountry.   Schemes  to which  State  financial  assistance  is  given,  but  whichare  not  undertaken  primarily  for the  relief of  unemployment  (e.g.,  HousingSchemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance arenot  included.   Certain other schemes  involving  Government assistance  are alsoexcluded  in view of  the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men whoare directly provided with employment thereby;  these include the Export  credits scheme and contracts  for equipment,  clothing,  &amp;c,  accelerated  by GovernmentContracting Departments.     Method of Compilation. The figures  for  the  Road  and  Bridge  Schemesassisted  by  the Ministry  of  Transport  and  for  schemes  assisted  by  theUnemployment  Grants  Committee  are  (with  the  exception  of  certain  road schemes  in respect pf which returns are  received  direct  by the  Ministry ofTransport)  obtained  from  returns  received  at  Employment  Exchanges  from local  and  other   Authorities   and   Public  Companies.    Those  relating  to schemes assisted under the  Trade  Facilities  Acts are  compiled  by the  TradeFacilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whomguarantees under the Acts have been given.Works assisted by 	Number of Men employed at 				Sept. 29,1928.

The figures take no account  of the employmentprovided indirectly, eg., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.    f These figures indicate men employed on the work itself.  They include part only of the men employedon the manufacture of the materials used.  They take no account of the  labour involved in  winning,transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.    Note. No distinction is now made between  the Forestry Commission^  normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part  of the normal programme.  The average number of forest employeesengaged on the Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) during the quarter ended September 30,1927, was 3,036 as compared with 2,940 for the corresponding quarter of 1927.
                                                 IY. OVERSEA SETTLEMENT.                                                        (Dominions Office,)     Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions),  various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities.  This Act, as  its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded.....     For many years before and after the war, the natural  increase of population  exceeded the net migration movement by about  300,000. a year, but recently the gap between the natural increase and the net migration movement has tended to diminish.   During 1927, the natural increase in  England, Scotland and Wales was 201,178, and the net migration - movement was 87,504.   Consequently, the natural increase during the year, after deducting the net migration, was 113,674.     The number of  persons approved for assistance and the number of departures  during the months of July, August and September, 1927-(with the corresponding figures for the year 1926), and for the six months ended the 30th September, 1927 and 1926, respectively, are  set out in the following Table:-&quot;                                            :. -                 -  Quabteely Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.

                          (Estimates, Class V, Vote 9.)    The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided insurance against unemploymentin certain selected industries.  It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of  persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied  compulsory  insurance  against  . unemployment &quot;to  12,000,000  persons.Subsequent amending Acts modified the  conditions of receipt  of benefit, increased contributions,  provided benefit  in respect of  dependants,  and authorised theTreasury to  make advances out  of.  the Consolidated  Fund up to a  limit  of 40,000,000.    By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1927, the rates of  benefit were revisedfrom the 19th April, 1928,  as follows :  17s. (instead of 18s.) a week for men, 15s. aweek for women, with 7s. (instead of 5s.)  a week for an adult  dependant and 2s. aweek for each young dependent child.  As from July, 1928, reduced rates of benefitoperated for persons under 21 years of age having no dependants ;  contributions alsowere reduced for all persons under 21 years of age.  Benefit may be paid for threemonths to a claimant who has paid 30  contributions in the  two years preceding the date of his claim, and may continue throughout each  subsequent period  ofthree months at the beginning of which  this condition is still  satisfied.  During a transitional period, which  in individual cases may extend to April  1930, benefitmay be paid  to a  claimant who does  not satisfy the above  condition, if he has paid 8 contributions in the two preceding years or 30 contributions at any timeand fulfils certain other conditions.Statement of Income and Expenditure of the Unemployment Fund from                    Armistice to September 29,  1928.                  j *Expenditure                                                            Benefit paid      ....      ....       ....   351,138,000        Appropriation for Administration   ....    34,918,000        Section  9 Unemployment Insurance          Act (No. 2), 1924, and &quot;Section 25--          Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920     2,954,000        Miscellaneous           &quot;   Refunds, &amp;c.....      ....       ....     1,937,000        Interest (Net)    ...      ....       ....     1,915,000                                               --392,862,000Income     Contributions         Employers............   133,564,000        Employed        ............   119,720,000        Exchequer       ....      ....       ....    92,018,000        Exchequer (for ex-Service Men)    ....     4,221,000Balance of  Old Fund at Armistice (excluding    Interest accrued) * -        Employers       ....      ........     5,825,000        Employed        ....      ....       ....     5,825,000        Exchequer       ....      ....       ....     3,884,000              H                                --   15,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net)....      ....       ....                27,030,000Miscellaneous     Deposits in respect of  future Contribu-        tions, &amp;c.....      ............                   775,000                                                           392,862,000349,523,000  * The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.NOTE.

                     (U.) MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT SCHEMES.                     ROAD AND  BRIDGE PROGRAMME, 1919-20.     To  assist in the provision of employment  for demobilised  members of  HisMajesty&apos;s  Forces until  such time  as  they could be re-absorbed into industry, theGovernment after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose ofmaking grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for  road work.   Thetotal of  such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britainand it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn agrant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.

TABLE 4.                              LAND SETTLEMENT.    In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-ment  (Facilities) Act, 1919, and other  Land Settlement Schemes  for the benefitprimarily of ex-Service  men, are carried out (a) through the  agency of CountyCouncils and Councils  of County. Boroughs and (b) through the  Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries.    Settlement through Local Authorities. The net capital cost of these schemes upto the 31st March,  1926,  when the Land Settlement  Scheme came to an end, isestimated to be  15,250,000, of which approximately  14,050,000 (net) was loanedby the Public Works Loan Board.   Interest in respect of such loans is payable byCouncils.   Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities)  Act, 1919, theExchequer bore the loss incurred up to the 31st March,  1926, on the Councils&apos;  SmallHoldings account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed to an economic rent), sofar as such loss had been reasonably and necessarily incurred.    As from the  1st April, 1926, the Exchequer assistance takes the form of annualcontributions to meet the difference between the loan charges  and the estimated net income from the Councils&apos; estates.   These contributions which  did not commenceuntil  the year 1927, will vary  from year to year, and  their total capitalized valuecannot at present be estimated.    In Scotland  land settlement is not conducted through the  agency of CountyCouncils.    Ministry&apos;s  Settlements. Since  1916  a  number   of  properties  have  been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any,  betweenthe annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small Holders is being borne by the Exchequer.  Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not  involve an appreciablecash call upon the Exchequer,  as additional capital expenditure is met from thesurplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.

Shortly  after the Armistice and throughout 1919, Juvenile UnemploymentCentres were opened in certain localities to provide instruction for unemployedjuveniles  with a view to preventing deterioration.   Centres were few in numberfrom 1920 to 1922, but were re-established on an extended scale during 1923.   Thepresent scheme  of  grants is, to some extent, an  emergency  measure pendingconsideration by the National Advisory Councils for  Juvenile  Employment of therecommendations of the  Malcolm, Salvesen and Blanesburgh Committees.  Incertain cases 75 per cent, grants and in others 100 per cent, per capita grants are payable, while in the case  of certain  mining areas  payment of  100 per cent.approved  out-of-pocket expenditure has been sanctioned.
