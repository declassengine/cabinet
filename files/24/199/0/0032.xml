Humrphrys to Lord Cushendun.-^(Received November 26.)(No. 106.  Secret.)My Lord,                                            Kabul,  october 31,  1928.    ON the 23rd October I had a long interview with Ghulam Sadiq at the  Afghan-Foreign Office at his request.  Ghulam Sadiq informed me that the office of  ForeignMinister was still not permanently filled, but he had been placed in charge of theForeign Office with full authority  in  the capacity of Acting Foreign Minister.Hitherto he had been engaged, to the exclusion of everything else, on the reorganisa-tion of the office,&apos;but he now looked forward to transacting with me much importantbusiness which would have the effect of drawing our two countries still more closelytogether.    2.   He started by conveying a private rnessage to me from King Amanulla thatHis Majesty hoped that the British Legation in Kabul would  shortly be raisepl io-the status of an Embassy, as the three other countries who  were  chiefly interested in afghanistan had already taken this step.  I replied that there were pther countries,notably Persia ahd China, where a similar state of affairs existed, and the fact that-His Majesty King George was represented by a Minister in Kabul should not betaken to mean  that Great Britain regarded her interests in&apos; Afghanistan as less-important than those of the Soviet or the  Turkish Republic.    3.   We then discussed the gift of arms  which had been suggested by  GhulamSadiq  in  London and  which it  &apos;was  proposed to  make  in  commemoration of&apos;King Amanulla&apos;s visit to India and England.  I remarked that a different kind ofgift which would  further the peaceful progress of&apos; Afghanistan would have  beenmoreffiappropriate, but Ghulam Sadiq&apos;insisted that Afghanistan  was more in need ofwar material for consolidation and defence than of anything else, and he  referredme once more to the opening  sentence of  article 6 of the  Anglo-Afghan Treaty of1921, which states that it is for  the benefit of the British Government that theGovernment of  Afghanistan shall be strong and prosperous. I reminded him thatthe  emphasis  in  the  context  which  he&apos; had quoted  was  laid  oh  machinery,.telegraphs, &amp;c, rather than on war material, and said that, in view of the demandsthat were constantly being put forward at Geneva and elsewhere for the limitationof  armaments, gifts of arms  to a foreign country were the. most difficult of all tojustify, and my Government wished to  make it clear that such a gift could not b&apos;e-repeated.  I am still withholding the written communication on the subject of thisgift until I  have the opportunity  of sounding the views of King Amanulla, but itseems unlikely that any other present,.except one of cash, would be equally accept-able to the Afghan Government.    4.  Ghulam Sadiq then informed me that he had entered into  a preliminaryarrangement with the German Junkers Aviation Company for the institution ofcommercial and postal air services, connecting the principal cities of Afghanistanwith neighbouring countries.  He mentioned the following lines :  Kabul-Kandahar-Herat-Meshed-Tehr an;   Kabul-Herat-Khushk;  Kabul-Kandahar-Karachi;  andKabul-Peshawar.  He said that he hoped a representative of the Junkers company would shortly visit Kabul to discuss these schemes.  I made no comment except thatit would be necessary to obtain the consent of neighbouring countries before such a project could be put into operation, and  I hinted that if a civil air service were to beestablished  between  India and Afghanistan, which  seemed  to me an excellentproposition, it would probably have to be operated by a British company.     5.  Ghulani  Sadiq  turned briefly  to the subject of railways  and  said  that king Amanulla would  come to no decision  until  he had  compared the  Germanproposals, which had not yet  been completed, with those which  had been submittedto  him by MM. Clemenceau and  Makcheef.   Railway schemes were  still  in theirpreliminary stage, and personally he was not over-sanguine that a large volume ofthrough traffic between Europe and India would be attracted to the Khushk-  ChamanRailway, but it was necessary for  Afghanistan to have railways if she were ever tomake any progress, and for the purpose  of internal  defence it was vital that the       [618  cc-3]
-capital should be linked up by rail with other centres.  Ghulam Sadiq gave me theimpression that he was personally prepared to back the German rather than theFrench scheme, possibly because, on account of his four years&apos; residence as Minister,in Germany, he foresees more likelihood of profit for himself if-a German firm is&quot;entrusted with the construction.     6.  After the question of overcoming present difficulties in regard to visas hadbeen discussed, I mentioned that it was time to remove the  restriction embodied inSchedule  II (e) and  (i)  of the Anglo-Afghan  Treaty  regarding the area of theLegation  grounds and the number of the Minister &apos;s staff and  servants.  GhulamSadiq said that he would now turn to the most important subject of all, which, he hoped, would shortly  engage the serious attention of my Government.  He  referredto the necessity for negotiating a new treaty.   I reminded him of the conversation which he  had held with Sir  Austen Chamberlain in  the Foreign Office in  London,and said that manifestations of goodwill in their daily relations  were of more valuebetween two neighbours than the elaboration of existing treaty engagements.  It was true that Sir Austen Chamberlain had  told him that  if the  Afghan government wished to put forward new proposals they would be considered,  but  the attitude olmy Government was  that it  was content to allow the existing treaty to remain inforce.  I suggested that he and I might examine the text of the 1921  treaty and putforward any amendments of  detail which suggested themselves to us in the light ofthe experience of the  past seven years.  Ghulam Sadiq protested that this procedure would not meet the requirements of the Afghan Government, who desired that anentirely new treaty, modified on the principle of  friendship, should be negotiated.In his view, and in the view of a great majority of Afghans, the treaty of 1921 wasonly intended to be temporary, and, except that it marked a beginning of a new era,he regarded this treaty as wholly unsatisfactory from the Afghan standpoint.  Ourmutual goodwill had been  amply demonstrated during  the  currency  of thispreliminary treaty, which had been aptly described as a neighbourly treaty.  Whatwas now  required was a  treaty of lasting friendship,  which would bind  our twocountries  together much more closely than hitherto.  He  suggested that we shouldeach prepare a draft of a new treaty and then meet to compare notes. I said that Ihad no instructions to do this, and in any case the suggestion did not  commend itselfto me as  practicable.  If I received authority from  my Government to enter*intoconversations with him on the subject a better course would be for him to acquaintme at the opening stage with the desiderata of the Afghan Government.  I could then furnish him with suggestions for improving the  draft of  the present treaty incertain matters of detail,  and amendments put forward by both  parties could, ifthey  received the approval  of our respective  Governments, be  embodied in an exchange of notes.     Ghulam Sadiq again  insisted that the present treaty  should be torn up and negotiations initiated de novo.  He felt confident that  if he and I were appointed by our Governments as plenipotentiaries in the matter we should be able in a few months to  conclude  an  instrument  entirely satisfactory to both parties,  which would emphasise our common interests and remain for ever  as a landmark in  Afghanhistory.   I hastened to deprecate any such extravagant expectations and repeated that His  Majesty&apos;s Government was not  in the  habit of negotiating  spectaculartreaties, but was always ready to assist a friendly neighbour  in its peaceful develop-ment.  Ghulam Sadiq expressed the hope that we should shortly meet again to discuss this all-important question, and in my telegram No. 163 I have requested instructions as to the attitude which I should adopt when I am again approached by the ForeignMinister on this subject.     7.  King Amanulla  has recently  outlined  a very expensive  programme  ofreforms which he is anxious to introduce with the least  possible delay, and  it seems likely that Ghulam Sadiq will attempt to discuss the reintrodUction of a cash subsidy in some form or other.  This has already been  ruled out by  His Majesty&apos;s  Govern-ment,  and I still adhere to the conviction, which I have expressed in previousdespatches, that the best and most useful manner in which we can help Afghanistanto be united and prosperous is to grant her generous  assistance in kind outside theprovisions of a treaty. The free loan of exports and the free provision of materials for the purpose of the improvement of Afghanistan&apos;s communications by road, rail and air with India still seems to me to offer the most valuable and the most permanentadvantages.  Ghulam Sadiq  and his friends are opposed to  this form of assistancebecause it gives them few, if any, opportunities for enriching themselves at theexpense of the  State, and the King himself would prefer to  handle the cash and
recruit his employees at his own discretion;  hut there is no getting away from the admission, which Mahmud Tarzi once made  to me in a moment of irritation at the behaviour of his colleagues, that if the  British Government were to fill the Kabulvalley with gold the country5 s communications would be in no whit improved thereby.    The Afghan,  both by temperament and  habit, possesses  a  capacity  for  theunprofitable absorption of gold to  an unlimited extent.  What  he entirely lacks isthe aptitude for organisation or the honest application of  funds.  I will quote twoexamples to illustrate these failings.  Three years ago about a mile of useless roadembankment was constructed near Dakka at a cost to the Afghan Government of 50,000, and last year the King paid twice this sum out of his own pocket for thebuilding of a cement factory in Kabul which has never turned out a single ounce ofcement.    8.   I come back to the conclusion that there is little, except a simplification of transit  facilities, the  exchange of additional consulates,  and  a general formulaasserting our friendly intention to assist Afghanistan in the peaceful development ofher resources,  that we can include without  embarrassment in a new treaty.  Butthere are many ways in which we could assist this country along the path of modernprogress which it would be inconvenient to tabulate in the form of treaty obligations.    9.   A copy of this despatch is being  sent to the Secretary of  State for India andto the Government of India.                                                I have, &amp;c.                                                       F.  H.  HUMPHRYS.
