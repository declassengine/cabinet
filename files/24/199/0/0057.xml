Copy HJ 0 .     . .ip.409(28)                  CABINET.                     DISTRESSED MIKING AREAS.             Memorandum by the Minister of tLabour.     One very important question has to be decided before weenter upon.the Debate on Thursday on the special measures announced by the Prime Minister on Monday to deal with the present emergency in the distressed mining areasa  That question is what are the areasthat are to be dealt with through the special measures?  At presentour transference policy, while naturally it operates mainly inrespect of miners, includes within its scope a limited number of areas where, although there may be some mining, the major industryis iron and steel or shipbuilding,  or botho  Already there ispressure to extend the scheme to other areas where there is heavyunemployment! I have so far not found it necessary to give way tothis pressure.     In the proposals outlined by the Prime Minister on Mondayreference was explicitly and advisedly made to the &quot;present emergency in the depressed mining areas&quot;,  These are areas whichqualify for assistance by passing the following tests          (l) A large number of persons unemployed,          (2) The long duration of the unemployment,          (.3&apos;) Isolation, there being no alternative industry                 available locally.     The new schemes with which I am concerned are (a) grants tofacilitate the movement of families and (b) schemes designed torecondition men for transfer to other areasj and I suggest thatwe  should not apply these new proposals to districts other thanthe distressed mining areas.  In tho first place, only a limited                                                        /amount
amount of money is available and we ought to apply that moneyto the places where the n&amp;ol is greatest.  In the second place,the transference policy can only carry a certain load  and wemust be careful to concentrate our energies rather than todissipate them.  In the third place,  once  we get away from thedepressed mining areas and admit iron and steel (except where  itis associated geographically with coal,  in which event distressediron and steel workers would benefit) or shipbuilding  we shallbe forced to include engineering, cotton and so on,  and our plans will break under their own weight.  The same considerations should I think govern the areas to be selected as coming withinthe schemes for feeding &amp;c.     If the Cabinet agree, therefore, I suggest that the line to be taken on Thursday should be that our new plans aredirected expressly to relieving the situation in the depressedmining areas.  In so far as the other areas are already withinthe scope of our existing plans, there will be no change.Ministry of Labour.18th December,  1928.Intd :  (A.3-MJ
