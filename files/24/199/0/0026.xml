(SECRET.  ,                                                   Copy No.   21CP. 376  (28).CABINET.THE  ESTIMATES  FOR  THE FIGHTING  SERVICES,  1929.            MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OE THE EXCHEQUER.    FOLLOWING upon the preliminary discussion  which took place at the last meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, t I desire to draw the attention ofmy colleagues to the question of the Estimates  for the Fighting Services for 1929.I append a table showing the expenditure for the last five years, from which it willbe seen that the expenditure estimated to be incurred in the current year is higherthan the expenditure of the year in which we took office.  I recognise that  duringthis period substantial economies have been made in the cost of Middle East Defence.On the other hand, the general level of wholesale prices has fallen since the  autumn of 1924 by no less than 17-1 Per cent., and this fact, together with the reduced ratesof pay for new recruits introduced in  1925, has afforded considerable relief to theEstimates.    In my opinion, it is necessary  for  us to effect a  marked  reduction in these estimates in 1929 as compared  with the current year.   In July last the cabinet decided, on the  recommendation of the  Committee  of Imperial Defence,  that itshould be assumed, for the purposes  of framing the  Estimates of the FightingServices, that at any given date  there will be no major war for ten years.*   In his speech at  the Guildhall on the 9th November, the Prime Minister, referring to theKellogg Pact, said : &quot; In spirit, every nation that signs that Pact has got to keep it before its mind  whenever  it examines its  own armaments; whenever it preparesestimates  of its own armaments, it must  realise what the implications of that Pactare.&quot;    I hold strongly that present political circumstances require us to give substantialeffect to these considerations, and to the expectations of economies in the Estimatesgenerally which the public will base upon the language used in the King&apos;s  Speech,and I do not think that the situation will be adequately met by anything less thana reduction of the total provision for the  Fighting Services in  1929 to  110 millions as a maximum, that is, a reduction of at least  4J- millions on this year&apos;s estimates.Moreover  such provisional indications of next year&apos;s revenue  and expenditure as-are now available make it  plain that,  in view of the commitments involved by thederating scheme  and the unemployment situation, I shall require to secure  savings of at least double that amount on the total Estimates in order to balance the Budget.Civil Estimates,  excluding the cost of Middle East Defence,  have been kept downto practically the same figure as in 1924, in spite of large increases of expenditure under statute on Housing, Widows&apos; and Old Age  Pensions, and the Beet SugarSubsidy, and in view of the reductions effected  last year I cannot look for  furtherappreciable savings on this head.     I therefore ask the Cabinet, on urgent grounds of policy as well as of financialnecessity,  to request the Defence Ministers to arrange in consultation that the totalof the Fighting Services Estimates for 1929 do not exceed  110 millions.  I suggest,as  a rough guide, that the reduction might be divided as to  2,750,000 on navy estimates,  1,000,000 on Army  and  750,000 on Air Estimates.   I  shall  also be       t See CP. 348 (28).    * Reference Cabinet, 39 (28), Conclusion 10.[18556]
