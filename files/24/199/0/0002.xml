IMPERIAL  GARRISONS.                           (OLD. Paper No. 328-C.)       (Previous Reference :  OLD. Minutes of 230th Meeting,  Minute (2).)     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the OverseaDefence  Committee on  the question as to whether  it is necessary  to retain theImperial garrisons at Jamaica and Bermuda.   (OLD. Paper No. 328-C.)     MR. BRIDGEMAN, in reply  to the Prime Minister, said that the Admiraltyfully agreed with the conclusion reached by the Oversea Defence Committee thatthe existing garrison should be maintained.     MR. AMERY said  that from  the point of view  of the Colonial  Office he alsostrongly agreed  with the conclusion of the  Oversea  Defence  Committee.   the garrisons in the West Indies had already been reduced to such  an extent that anyfurther reductions amounted to abandonment.   Replacement of the troops, if it became necessary after withdrawal, would be bound to attract attention and  causeexcitement in the American press.   It appeared to him that in view of the situation of these ports vis-a-vis the Panama  Canal, in a war not only with the United States,it would be absurd to reduce the garrisons any further.  .   SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS also agreed with the  conclusion ofthe Oversea Defence Committee and  hoped that the Secretary of State  for theColonies  would remember what he had just said when he  came to  consider thequestion of Colonial contributions.     THE PRIME  MINISTER observed that the  question as to  whether theinterests  of economy were sufficient to overcome the strategical arguments given bythe Oversea Defence Committee in  favour of retaining the garrison was one whichshould be reserved for consideration by the Cabinet.                                 CONCLUSION.    THE  COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed         To  approve the conclusion of the Oversea Defence Committee that the    present Imperial garrisons at Jamaica and Bermuda should  be retained.*          *          *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,    November 8, 1928.[18436-6]

AT a meeting on the 25th July, 1928, the Cabinet decided to refer to theCommittee of Imperial Defence the question as to whether it is necessary to. retainImperial Garrisons in Jamaica and Bermuda (Cabinet 41 (28), Conclusion 8), andthe Prime Minister has directed the Oversea Sub-Committee of the  Committee ofImperial Defence to consider, this reference in the first instance.                 &quot;The present Imperial Garrison.                                              -r     2.  Since the late war the strength of the regular troops in the West Indies has been considerably reduced.-  In 1926,  on the recommendation of the  Committee ofImperial Defence (C.LD., 216th Meeting, Item (4) ), the West India Regiment wasdisbanded, and at the end of last year the regular  coast defence troops were,  with theapproval of the Committee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D., 230th Meeting,  Item  (2)),&apos;withdrawn from Bermuda, the armament and lights being placed on an instructionaland maintenance basis.  This decision is subject to review annually.     In  addition^  the  Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers  at  Jamaica have beenreduced to small cadres. ,     The present regular garrison consists of a total of 65 officers and 1,052 other ranks, located at Jamaica and Rermuda,; as shown in the Appendix.  It will be notedthat the majority of these troops 27 officers and 83.4 other ranks are provided bythe regular infantry battalion.   The Oversea Defence  Committee  would inviteparticular attention to the fact that this battalion is the only regular  infantry unit in the whole of the West Indian Colonies.Strategical Im/portance of Jamaica and Bermuda.    3.  Kingston, Jamaica, and St. George&apos;s,  Bermuda,  are the only ports in theWest Indies provided with fixed, defences, and, in the event of war with any maritimePower (not only with the United States), both these places would assume considerablenaval importance.  &apos;  Kingston would  be required as a naval anchorage, a fuelling base, a convoyassembly port!and a contraband control base.  St. George&apos;s,  besides possessing theonly naval dockyard in the West Indies as well as an important Imperial wireless station,  would also be required  as a naval anchorage.   In any maritime war,therefore, both these  ports would require efficient defences.    4.  Although, in view of  the present international  situation, it  is consideredthat the coast defences of these ports may, for reasons of economy, be reduced  to acadre or a care and maintenance basis, the Oversea Defence Committee are of opinionthat, from the point of view of Imperial Defence, it would be most unwise to effectfurther reductions of regular troops. &apos;   &apos;;:&apos;  -  &apos; [18269] -      &quot;  -                               :      &apos;   &apos;  &apos; &quot;5  ;&apos; [H
Internal Security. .    8.  Although the maintenance  of  order is  primarily a matter for the  lccalGovernments in the West Indies, and it is believed that local resources are probablysufficient to deal with ordinary strikes and riots,  the Committee would suggest thatin places, such as Jamaica, which possess a considerable black population, there must always be a latent possibility of disturbances with which the  local forces could notcope..  The coloured population is peculiarly susceptible to agitation from outsidesources, and there has been since the war a substantial exacerbation of &quot; anti-white &quot;feeling throughout the coloured peoples of the world.  Powers hostile to the BritishEmpire have not been slow to take advantage of this feeling, and it would appearmore  than  likely that the creation of internal unrest&quot;, even in areas..far removed from  the probable theatre of war,  might. be attempted as a  preliminary  to  thenext war.  The Negro Rebellion of 1865, which was. suppressed by Governor Eyre,gives anlndicatioh of the difficulties to be faced in the event of a large scale outbreak.    9.  In British Honduras^ and British Guiana we haYecowmom.frontiers withsome  of the more disorderly Latin American Republics, and  regular troops might    In this connection, the Committee feel that it may not be out of place to draw-attention to the principle laid, down In the final report of the Carnarvon Commission,;1882, in the following words :-         &quot; No addition to the number and  fighting  power of Your  Majesty&apos;s, ships    will make up for the want of coaling stations  ....  We desire  to impress upon    Your Majesty&apos;s-Government the paramount importance to the  British Empire    of secure coaling stations  . .  . . Without secure and well-placed coaling stations    Your Majesty&apos;s ships, however numerous and powerful, will be unable to protect    trade, or, perhaps, even to reach distant parts of the Empire ... .  The stations    far distant from the United Kingdom and in close proximity to the stations of    foreign Powers are liable to sudden attack, and cannot be reinforced without ]ong -  delay.  Their garrisons must, therefore, be kept up to war strength.&quot;    5.  While it has been considered expedient, for  reasons of economy, to infringethis principle in many cases, to the extent of reducing  the garrisons considerably below the strength required in war time, there is no precedent for entirely denudingof  regular  troops  a  naval  anchorage  which would  require  efficient  defencesimmediately on  the outbreak of war,  and to which a garrison cannot be  safelydespatched in the course of a few days.  To  do so in the case of Jamaica or Bermudawould,  in  the  opinion&apos; of  the Oversea Defence  Committee,  be  particularlyundesirable.    6.  The propinquity of the West Indies to the United States must be borne inmind when considering the possibility of despatching regular troops  during times ofstrained relations,  and the  Committee would draw attention to the following extractfrom the Minutes of the 230th Meeting  of the Committee of Imperial Defence :-         &quot; THE PRIME MINISTER asked Sir Victor Wellesley what the Foreign Office    thought would be the attitude of America if, subsequently, we wished to reinforce    the Colony with regular troops.    -   : SIR VICTOR WELLESLEY replied that he thought if conditions were normal a    certain  amount  of hostile criticism  by the Press might have to be faced, but, if    relations were strained, it might create considerable excitement.&quot; ; . y 7.  As long as the regular battalion remains in the West Indies small movements of troops will  continue to take place in connection with draft finding  and  leave, sothat, in case of necessity, it would be possible to increase the garrison appreciablywithout attracting undue attention.  The re-establishmeht of a regular garrison at a place from which all regular troops had previously been withdrawn would, however,be almost certain to arouse  international suspicion. .   The Committee  are also of the opinion that,  although the present regulargarrisons of Jamaica and Bermuda are admittedly insufficient for defence in war,they do provide a certain deterrent, since their presence would involve the despatch ofan organised expedition to  capture the ports.
 well be required to preserve the integrity of these Colonies.  It would not be possible for troops from Great Britain to reach the West Indies in time either for this purpose or for suppressing internal disorder, and, as stated above,  the regular battalion at Jamaica  and Bermuda is the only regular infantry unit in the whole  of the West Indian&apos;Colonies.    &apos;  &quot;7&apos;       ;          - -          , ,       - Other Considerations.     10.   Although the question of Colonial contributions  is hardly  within their province, the Oversea  Defence Committee venture to suggest that whilst a Colony, such as Jamaica, might be persuaded to continue its contribution to Imperial funds so long as an Imperial Garrison is located there, it would hardly be likely to agree to continue any payment towards Imperial Defence if the regular troops were with- drawn.  The result would,  therefore, be that His Majesty^s  Government in Great Britain would retain the eventual responsibility for the defence of the  West Indies, whilst losing the small financial assistance they at&apos;present receive.     11.   The question of British prestige is also, perhaps,  worthy  of consideration in connection with the question of withdrawing  the regular  garrisons.   The British soldier maintains British prestige throughout the Empire, and is the outward sign of England&apos;s ability to maintain her authority.  From the point of view of Imperial prestige it might, therefore, be unwise to withdraw the few regular troops now remaining in the West Indies.  In this connection, it is noteworthy that the French maintain some 700 or  800 troops in their West Indian Colonies, which cannot be compared to  ours either in extent or importance.     12.  Lastly, the possible reaction on  local trade and opinion in Bermuda and Jamaica is, perhaps, worth consideration.  So far as the Committee  are aware there is no evidence of any desire in either Colony for the entire withdrawalof Imperial troops.   The presence of a regular  garrison provides a considerable amount  of employment and stimulus to local trade, and the withdrawal  of the regular troops would  undoubtedly, promote local depression for a considerable period.  In this connection, the Committee invite attention to the following extract from a telegram from the  Governor of  Jamaica, dated, the 17th June, 1926, on  the subject of the disbandment  of the West India Regiment:          &quot; Confidential,  17th  June.  Your telegram of  10th June, Confidential.    Disbandment  will probably be used  for  anti-white  propaganda  and will    undoubtedly cause great outcry, not only for sentimental reasons, but because    of the loss to Kingston tradesmen and increase of unemployment  due to throwing    men of the regiment, and those who live on them, on a labour  market already    overstocked.    The loss  to Kingston tradesmen caused by the withdrawal of the regular white troops would, in all probability, exceed that caused by the  disbandment  of the West India Regiment.    13.  The Committee have not thought it necessary  to make  a detailed enquiry into the cost of the garrison, and the economy that might be effected by removing the infantry battalion.  They have, however, been informed that the withdrawal of the battalion to a station not further away than the Mediterranean would  result in an annual saving of between  32,000 and  44,000.                                 CONCLUSION.     14.   To sum up, the Oversea Defence Committee are of opinion that the present Imperial  Garrisons  at Jamaica and Bermuda should be retained  on  the following grounds.: -  f-      .  .     ,    .   i         &apos;  &quot;  -      -  &apos;-               ^ -1     (a.) Both Kingston and Bermuda will be of considerable strategic importance           in a war with any maritime  Power, and must,therefore be defended.           Any  Further  reductions  in the garrisons would virtually amount to&apos;:&quot;      abandoning them.   Once abandoned  it would  be  difficult,  and probably     iv      impracticable, for political and local reasons, to reintroduce adequate.&apos;, -         garrisons before the outbreak of war. - -            j. , - - .--.r aj
(&amp;.) The battalion at Jamaica and Bermuda is the only regular, infantry unit in       the  West Indies, and might be  required to  deal  with  local unrest on a       large  scale,, a. contingency which -cannot  be  disregarded in  Colonies       possessing a large black population.(c.)  The withdrawal of the garrison would be harmful to British prestige,. and  ,;T  might cause depression in local trade, besides affording an excuse to  the       local Governments for discontinuing their  contributions  to  Imperial       funds.
