November 1928.SECRET.                                                    Copy No.    35COMMITTEE&apos; OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 2&apos;38th Meeting, held on November 8, 1928.     ******                     (4.) SINGAPORE NAVAL BASE.                          (OLD. Paper No. 322-C.)      (Previous Reference :  OLD. Minutes of 235th Meeting, Minute (14).)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Secretary informing them that the time for the annual review of the conclusions reached by the committee at their 199th Meeting had now been reached (OLD. Paper No. 322-C).    THE PRIME MINISTER said that at their 199th  Meeting the Committee had agreed that  there was  no necessity to make  preparations  involving  additional expenditure for placing  at Singapore a British battle fleet superior or equal to thesea-going navy of Japan, and that this decision  should be reviewed annually in thelight  of  the international  situation.  This  decision had been reaffirmed by  theCommittee in 1927.  He  asked whether the Foreign Office considered that any changehad taken place in the international situation during the  last year which necessitatedany alteration in this conclusion.    SIR VICTOR WELLESLEY said  he felt  sure that the Acting Secretary ofState for Foreign  Affairs would say that there had been no  change which would necessitate any modification.    SIR MAURICE HANKEY asked whether, in view of the  conclusion  of  theCommittee  at their 226th Meeting &quot; that it should be assumed for the purpose of framing the Estimates of the Fighting Services that at any given  date there will beno major war for 10 years,&quot; which decision was also subject to annual review, it wasnecessary to continue bringing up the specific question of the Singapore Naval base in addition.    Mr. BRIDGEMAN  asked if  this  meant  that  the minor programme  for singapore should be continued but that the major programme, i.e., making prepara-tions for placing at Singapore a battle fleet superior in strength or equal to the sea-going Navy of Japan, should only be brought up at the instance  of any particularMinister who considered that a  decision by the Committee of Imperial Defence had become necessary.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this would be the case.  [18436-4]
                            Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed  (i.) That  the  general  policy recommended at their  199th Meeting  on the      2nd  April, 1925,  and reaffirmed at the 229th Meeting on the 14th July,      1927, was still sound and should be adhered to.(ii.) That,  in view of the assumption already agreed to  (C.I.D. 236th Minutes,      Item (6)), that for the purpose of framing the estimates of the Fighting      Services  at any date there would be no major war for 10 years, the      question should no longer be brought up annually for review, but that it      should be left to the discretion of Departments concerned to bring it to      the notice of the Committee if and when they considered any modification      desirable.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,    November 8, 1928.
l&apos;  [This Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  June 1928.SECRET.                                                      Copy No.   C322-G.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.  SINGAPORE NAVAL  BASE.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 318-C.)                           Note by the.Secretary.    I AM directed by the Prime Minister to remind the Committee of ImperialDefence that,  in accordance with the conclusions  reached by the Committee at itsI99th Meeting, held on the 2nd April, 1925,  the development of the Naval Base at singapore is to be reviewed annually in the light of the international situation.    The time for this annual review has now been reached.    2.  For convenience of reference,  the conclusions  of the Committee on  thissubject are quoted in extenso below :      &quot; 1.  The Committee  of Imperial Defence  recommend  that the policy of leaving           to the Admiralty, subject to the paramount authority of the Cabinet,  the           responsibility  for  the  naval  defence  of the Empire on the basis of  the           one-Power standard,  should  not be reversed  or modified.   Even before           the  War  it  was recognised  that the two-Power  standard  did   not           necessarily imply that our fleets were  able simultaneously to deal with           the concentrated fleets  of two first-class  Naval Powers  in different           quarters of the  globe  as well as to provide for all other naval require-           ments.   This  is equally true of the one-Power standard to-day.   The           requirements of  a one-Power standard are satisfied if our fleet, wherever           situated, is equal to the fleet of  any other  nation, wherever situated,           provided that  arrangements are made from time to time in different parts           of the world, according as the international situation requires, to enable           the local forces  to maintain  the situation against vital and irreparable           damage pending the arrival of the  main fleet, and to give the main fleet           on arrival sufficient mobility.    2.  The Committee accept the view of the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs           that;  in existing circumstances,  aggressive action against the British           Empire on the  part  of Japan within  the   next ten  years is not a           contingency seriously to be apprehended.              The Foreign Office should be  responsible  for warning the Cabinet           and  the Committee  of Imperial Defence of  any change in  the inter-           national situation in the Far East which would  necessitate a fresh review           of the question.    3.  Although, in accordance with recent decisions, preliminary arrangements to           establish docking facilities for our largest ships at Singapore and to           develop gradually the necessary oil  fuel installations, on our  Eastern           routes should  proceed, there  is no necessity, in view of conclusion 2, to           make  preparations  involving  additional expenditure for placing  at           Singapore, for a decisive battle in  the Pacific, a British battle fleet with           cruisers, flotillas and all ancillary vessels superior in strength,  or at least           equal, to the sea-going  Navy of Japan.              This decision should be reviewed automatically by the Committee of           Imperial Defence every year,  in the light of the international situation.[17853]
               Further,  in order that all the data required for a decision may be           readily available in the event of a change in the situation in the Far East,           the  Committee of Imperial Defence and the Singapore Sub-Committee           should inquire and report as to the preparations which would have to be           made if it became necessary to reverse the above decision.    4. To meet the unlikely contingency  of war  occurring  before the base at           Singapore is capable of sustaining a British fleet superior to the Japanese           Navy, the Admiralty should consider in advance what facilities can be           made  available from  Great  Britain  or elsewhere  to supplement  the           facilities which already exist in the Far East.&quot;    3.  The above conclusions were  considered  by the Committee of  ImperialDefence at the 229th Meeting on the 14th July, 1927,  and it was agreed that thegeneral policy contained therein was still sound and should be adhered to.(Signed)M.  P, A. HANKEY.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,        June 26, 1928.
