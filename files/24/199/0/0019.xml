In order to obviate the difficulty of diplomatic agents being utilised for purely commercial work, the Union Government have decided to maintain theTrade Commissioners Office at New York  and to accredit to the President of theUnited States of America an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiaryto take charge of all affairs relating to the Union of  South Africa.    2.

APPENDIX  (C).                 :          &apos;          (I-)  Telegram from the Imperial Secretary, South Africa, to the Under-Secretary of                          State for Dominion Affairs.    No. 95, 9th November.   Following is translation of letter to High Commissionerfor Union of South Africa, London, enclosing memorandum by Prime Minister on amendments he considers it desirable to make  in Tyrrell&apos;s despatch of 28th august to M. Briand relating to  the appointment of Canadian Minister at Paris, which mr. Amery may wish to consider carefully before he receives a copy in personal letter from General Hertzog due in London 26th November.  Begins: 5th November:The Honourable the  High Commissioner.  I am directed by the  Prime Minister tocommunicate&quot;to you&apos;  the following.  He  has noted with-interest contents  of yourprivate letter of 18th September from Geneva, more especially your  observations inconnexion with letter of 24th June, 1924, addressed  by  the British  Ambassador tothe Secretary of State in respect of appointment of an Irish Minister at Washington.Since receipt  of your private letter Prime Minister has received from Colonel Amerycopy  of  correspondence between  British  Ambassador at  Paris  and Minister  forForeign Affairs there (see despatch No. 282 of 28th September, 1928, of which a copy is enclosed).   The General  considered  it preferable  to devote his attention to last
 letter.  You will find enclosed observations which his study of that correspondence has led him to make.  The General will be obliged if you will bring these observations to the notice of the British Government (Department of Foreign Affairs).     The General has also decided to write personally to Colonel Amery on this matter,. and to point out to him unsatisfactory terms of letter to French Minister for Foreign Affairs.     The question of the  terms of the letter which should be addressed to the French Government  respecting  the appointment of an  Irish Minister  at  Paris will  soon have to be discussed.   In view of importance to  us also of this matter, the General is anxious that his observations should receive careful consideration before decision is taken.                                                 ...     The Union Government at any rate is not prepared to let the matter rest without further discussion of terms of earlier letter.  With deepest respect,  &amp;c. (Signed) H. D. J. BODENSTEIN.     Following is text of memorandum.  Begins:  Observations of Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa on letter of Sir William Tyrrell, British Ambassador at Paris, to French Minister for  Foreign  Affairs  of 28th August,  1928,  regarding appointment of a Canadian Minister Plenipotentiary in Paris.     Section 1,   His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Great Britain and Canada have, &amp;c. Why His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great  Britain?   His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain being nothing more than Canada&apos;s agent in the matter, it is immaterial to what conclusion it may have come in the matter, and it is not correct nor wise to couple its decision or conclusion with that of its principal Canada.  By so doing it necessarily creates the impression of acting as guardian to Canada.     The words  &quot; Governments in Great  Britain  and &quot; in line 3 should  be deleted,. and the  words  &quot;Government in&quot; substituted in their place; and word &quot;have&quot; after &quot; Canada &quot; in the same line deleted and &quot; has &quot; substituted.     Section 2, line 1.   &quot;  Imperial concerns.&quot;  If it were made quite clear that these words refer to nothing more than mere matters concerning Great Britain and all her territories and possessions, including India, Rhodesia, and as apart from Dominions,. 1 would have no objection to them. But unless this is made quite clear they will be taken by Foreign Powers as indicating existence of some  kind of State-Empire  or Empire-State such as is contemplated by group-unit idea school a conception which was  advisedly  rejected at 1926  Conference both during  discussion on  Dominion Status and thereafter when Locarno Pact was discussed and Dominions decided not to be parties to that Pact.     Such a State-Empire  will be all  the more readily  inferred from the fact  that these words are verbally adopted from similar documents as the one under discussion of a date prior to 1926, when it was still held by many that the  British Empire  in relation to Dominions was such an Empire-State  (vide letter from British Embassy, Washington,  of 24th of June,  1924,  to the  Secretary of  State, U.S.A.,  in re appointment of an Irish Free State Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington).     It is therefore necessary that, if these  words are to remain unaltered, it should be explicitly  understood no less by  Foreign Nations  than  by us that no  such interpretation as referred to is intended and that the word &quot; Imperial &quot; is not to be extended beyond countries and territories indicated above.     Section 3.  The arrangements proposed by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  would not denote any departure from principle of diplomatic  unity of the Empire.   This should come out.     1.  &quot;&quot;Arrangements  proposed by His  Majesty&apos;s  Governments.&quot;  Again,  why should the British Government make any proposals in this matter ?  It acts at the request and as the agent of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada.  Why, then, should it be said to propose ?    2.  &quot;Principle of  the diplomatic  unity of  the  Empire.&quot;   What is  this principle?  I can understand such a principle existing if doctrine of a Group-Unit Empire favoured by  Smuts had been  accepted by Imperial Conference.   But  this idea having been rejected and principle of Locarno having been approved  of by Conference, I do not understand what is meant by the  principle  of the diplomatic unity of the Empire.   Again, it is a phrase taken  verbally from documents of a date prior to 1926, the author evidently not conscious of the  changes in the Empire idea effected by the Conference of that date.    Section 4, line 1.  These proposals.   Why proposals?   The French Government correctly   style  it  &quot; L&apos;intention  de   Sa  Majeste  le  Roi a  accrediter  . ..  ..un envoye,&quot; &amp;c.  .        ,\                        ,                  &apos;   . &quot;i      [18532]                                                       B  2
     The words &quot; These proposals,&quot; coming as they do in the final Section, give the impression as though the subject-matter of Section 2 and Section 3 are also submitted for approval of France; while they are not more than  intimation to France of a (omitted word) between Great  Britain and the Dominions, upon matters solely affecting them and as to which no proposal for approval by France can be intended. I feel therefore that  &quot; these proposals &quot; should read &quot; the &quot;decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada.&quot;                                 1     It is that decision as described in Section 1  which it is intended to convey to France for her approval, and not arrangement  between members  of  the British Commonwealth as to modus operandi of  their Ambassadors, inter si, which, as far as France is concerned, res inter cdios.   Again, the word &quot; proposal &quot; has been taken over from  documents prior to 1926 without giving due weight to changes since that date.                              m-       &apos;*.         -. .    3-,     Section 4, line 2 : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government trust.&apos;&apos;  This should either read &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada trust,&quot; or &apos;: it is trusted,&quot;     It is,  to my mind, lost sight  of every time that His Majesty&apos;s  Government in Great Britain is no more than  a channel or agent in  this document,  and their principal is Canada and none other.     Line 4, British Empire,   This should be &quot; Canada.&quot;  -What has  British Empire to do here  when the matter is one concerning appointment of an envoy for Canada, and what is here meant by the words British Empire ?  One cannot help feeling that the document has been drafted too much under the conception of British Empire as a super-State.                                               1     The question further arises  in what relation  do  the Words British  Empire here stand to the words &quot;Imperial concerns &quot; used in section 2 above.  Pretoria, 2nd November.  Memorandum ends.     In brief conversation, which will be  resumed  on  Tuesday, Prime Minister informed me that his desire was to lift question out of routine office  communication and transform it into personal  discussion between  himself  and Mr.  Amery. .. I observed that memorandum conveyed the  impression that TyrreLVs despatch.;was in conflict with 1926  Conference resolutions, and implied  mala fides  on  the  part,,of Government of Great, Britain.  Prime Minister  denied any such intention,  saying that he had merely jotted down points for  subsequent discussion and elaboration just as he would, if reading through a brief, jot down points he proposed make later when addressing a court.                                     (2.)    -                \ . Paraphrase Telegram from the Under-Secretary  of State for Dominion Affairs to                      the Imperial Secretary, South Africa.     IMPORTANT, Secret, No. 47, 12th November.     For the purpose of your discussion to-morrow with Hertzog following may helpyou:-            i    v          &quot;;.     .       ^    *r,;\,           . Form of notes relating to appointment of  diplomatic Representatives of Dominions.-                             in  foreign countries.     Pending further expression of views of Cabinet here (see telegram to Union, No. 114) it is important  that no detailed  discussion should be entered into by you, but actual  modifications  proposed  by Irish Free State Government were in  fact of a much more limited character than those  described in your telegram  No.  95.  These have been  telegraphed to you separately.  Union Government, in  their telegram 17th  October, No. 113, enquired  as to  these  modifications, but as  the Free  State Governments suggestions were communicated in  a  semi-official letter we thought it best not to reply to that telegram officially.   If course of conversation with Hertzog renders it  desirable that you should inform  him of  the  Free State Governments suggestions, our reason for not sending an official reply should be explained to him, and it should be made clear that position  still remains as stated in our telegram to Union, No.  114, i.e., that consideration of whole  question of modification; of phraseology is postponed until return of Sir Austen Chamberlain, a course to which Irish Free  State Government have  agreed.
Telegram from the Imperial Secretary, South Africa,- to  the  Under-Secretary  df.,                          State for Dominion Affairs.    No. 100, 17th November.  Having disposed of matter relating to the status  ofthe High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa, as indicated in my telegramNo. 98  of 15th November,   General Hertzog discussed with me amendment  hesuggested should be made in notes requesting foreign countries to receive Dominiondiplomatic representatives.  I said that as liaison between the British and the UnionGovernments, my principal duty was to &quot; round off corners &quot;  which inevitably projectinto the path of &quot; direct communication.&quot;  I said that on reading Prime minister&apos;s memorandum on TyrrelLs despatch of 28th August I was left with impression thatits tone was somewhat brusque.  General Hertzog explained that he had read throughTyrrelhs despatch, jotting down points to be used in presenting his case in  favourof amendment.  Any appearance of  brusqueness was  unintentional.  He producedcopy of  memorandum and suggested  that we should discuss his proposals seriatim.    I suggested, with reference to paragraph 1, that a twofold notification was being-made  to the French Government:  (a) That the British Ambassador would cease  torepresent  Canada;  (b) that a  Canadian Minister would henceforward  take overCanadian business.  To  that extent the  British  Government  Was involved  in the notification to the French Government of the proposed change.    The Prime Minister thought that paragraph 1 in  its  present form could not fail to convey to the French Government impression that Canada was in some wayunder the tutelage of Great Britain.  France&apos;s attitude towards Dominions&apos; statushad occasionally  been unsatisfactory, and he considered it most important that dominion autonomy, of which appointment of  these Ministers was a manifestation,should not be impugned  in  the eyes of foreign  Governments  by the terms  of the notification.    In regard to paragraph 2, I instanced defence as a matter  of Imperial concern,that is,  of collective concern, to all  parts of the. Empire, including India,  crown colonies and Protectorates.   The Prime Minister said that  he thought that allDominions freely recognise that Great Britain should act as spokesman and leaderin matters which required concerted action.  Smuts had been inclined to argue thatno action should be taken without the consent of all members of the Commonwealth.This view the 1926 Conference  unanimously rejected.   He  instanced Anglo-french naval Pact as an example where Great Britain rightly, in his opinion, acted without consulting Dominions.   In regard to Locarno, Dominions, while not participating,endorsed the action of Great Britain.  Matters of Imperial concern, however, weredomestic questions to be settled amongst ourselves.  France was in no way concernedin their solution, and he thought that they should not be included in proposals as ifthey were being  submitted  to  the French Government for their approval.   Thelines on which the British and Canadian Ministers would act might, however, with advantage be &quot;intimated to&quot;  France.   The last two sentences of paragraph 3adequately and satisfactorily explained that the relative jurisdiction of the Britishand Canadian  Ministers would be determined by consultation between them andrendered paragraph 2 unnecessary.  As regards  the question  of diplomatic unity,the Prime Minister thought this phrase hinted at existence  of an Empire State.  Ireplied  that insistence on  our  individual independence could  be carried too far,particularly in our relations with Foreign Powers.  The effect would be isolating  of dominions and  weakening of their influence and that of the Empire in international affairs.   The Prime Minister replied that he attached  the greatest importance  toEmpire  &quot; solidarity &quot; in foreign policy, but he considered the word &quot; unity &quot; implieda  &quot;concrete&quot; or too rigid  association.   He  suggested that the  first sentence  ofparagraph  3  should  indicate  that arrangement proposed  did  not  denote any departure from the principle that  His Majesty&apos;s  diplomatic representatives would act in&quot;  unison.&quot;                                                 -    Subject to  the foregoing observations, the Prime  Minister has no  objection;  tothe use of the term &quot; British Empire &quot; in paragraph 4.   He considers that relationsbetween Great Britain and Dominions have been placed On  sound basis by the Con- .ference  of 1926, which disposed of any suggestion of the existence of&apos;super-State &apos;or group-State.   He had no objection whatever to the use of the term &quot;BritishEmpire,&quot; because he considered that there was no longer any danger  of its beingmisconstrued.  He had said this to the Nationalist Congress at Winburg.   He felt
                                      6                                   / /that relations between Great  Britain and Dominions would  become increasinglycordial and frank.  Great Britain had freely consulted the Union on all questions ojc&quot;policy, and had communicated to the Union Government and High commissioned for the Union of South Africa all reports and documents,  however secret or con-fidential, and there could be no question  of this Dominion not co-operating withGreat Britain in every way possible.  Before despatching this telegram I showed itto the Prime Minister  in  the form  of a  memorandum of  our conversation.   Hesuggested some modification to paragraph 4, and the text of that paragraph has been adjusted in this telegram to meet his wishes.  I informed him that I proposed to telegraph the substance  of the memorandum  to you so that  it should  reach theSecretary of State not later than his letter.
