At  their Meeting on November  21st 1928 cabinet 52(28)      Conclusion 2),  the  Cabinet agreed, that a Committee composed      as  follows -                    The  Lord Ghana ell or (in the Ohair)                    The  Secretary of State for War                    The  President of the Board of Ira&amp;a                    The  Minister of Transport      should  meet to  consider the present  position of the work of the      Central Electricity Board.      2.      Appended to  this Report Is a  Memorandum circulated to us      by  the  Minister if  Transport to which is attached a Report  by the      Central Electricity Board setting out the present position of the      work of that Board  under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, and      embodying  an estimate by Sir John Snell, the Chairman of the      Electricity Commissioners, of the probable progress to the  cgrid of      June 1929  in connection with the submission of schemes.    The      information contained in these documents has been supplemented      in  the  course  of a  conference which  we have held with Sir John      Snell,  Sir Andrew 3-anoen and Sir John BrooJao, Chairman and      Secretary  respectively of the Board.      3.      The Central  Electricity Board was constituted in March      19B7 and has therefore been at work  for little more than eighteen      months.  Up to  the  present,  schemes  for four areas, covex*ing 34$      ef  the  total area of the country, 64^ of the population and nearly      63^ of  the present  sales of current,  have been approved.COPY NO. fjiL
JFartlujr eohemec for the roaaalning four areas  are now  in preparation and will, it is anticipated, have been  transmitted.to the Central Electricity Board by 30th June 1929,    In this.event schemes will have been prepared for about 7Qfo of thearea of the country, 9?f0 of the population and 98f0  of  thepre-.sent sales of current by next summer.,4.     The Board have doliberatsly speeded up the placing of contracts in respect of the constructional work  on  the transmission system, and intend to continue this policy.The total value of contracts already placed by the  Board inapproximately  3,000,000; further substantial orders  of ever 9,000,000 in value will be placed before next summer.  Whileit is open to foreign contractors to tender, the Board havebo far placed all their orders with British firms&apos;^  at  prices which they regard as satisfactory.   -deliveries under  these contracts will extend over a period of years and will, to someextent, be determined by the rate at which wayleaves and other necessary consents can be obtained,5.     In addition to the alaove, it is estimated that  in thenext 5 or S years the gross expenditure on standardisation offrequencies will amount to over  8,830,000, of which  190,000has already teen advanced or approved*6o     YIe are assured that there Is ne justification for thesuggestion that the introduction of the transmission  system has sterilized development for the time being, and  has accordingly increased the volume of unemployment.   The Intro-duo ti on of the scheme by freeing undertakers from the  necessityof extending the production side cf their business, will enable                            .2. &apos;             (Note .

them to coD.OGntra.ta  on the  development  end  extension of their.distribution business,     Ihany  of them arc fully- alive--to the advantage of  this oircuiast&amp;noso.    By June, 1929, thevalue of the orders  given out by the Board  since it  was constituted will,  It is estimated.,  be several  times  greaterthan  the value of  the  orders for plant  which would have beengiven out in the same  period if  the scheme  had never beenadopted.7.     No doubt need be entertained that  the electrifioationof rural areas will  be greatly facilitated  and hastened by theprovision of the &quot;transmission scheme *   In several progressiverural areas good results are already being  obtained,  and it ishoped In the near  future to start  in Bedfordshire, as a demonstration experiment, a rural  area  scheme, the working ofwhich should provide valuable data for  future  electricaldevelopment in country districts.8.     Thjsh Cabinet will note that  the Beard hope te  begin tosupply electricity in the early  part of 1929,  and to  beginoperating tne first  section of the  main transmission system inApril next,,  She Board have thus been able  considerably toantedate, the time  at which  it was  estimated in 1924  that thesystem could start working.9.     Sir John Sue11 ha3 Informed us that  so  far as  oan be atpresent foreseen the estimated total capital cost of  the works to be undertaken by  the Central  Electricity Board (transmissionlines, transforming  stations and equipment) will be  of the orderof  27,000,000; this fig-are is exclusive  of the cost  of frequencystandardisation and  of the  expenditure  to be incurred by under-takers in the provision of new Power Stations.  The  Cabinet arereminded that in the Report of the  Electrical  Development Committeeof July 19S5  fCcPc562(25),  the comparable figure was  estimated...at  25,000,000.                            3.

Sir J. Shell now estimates the net oostof standardization at  16,000,000 (due to growth of connect-ions during the last four years) if the whole country ir^ludiag&quot; the Koith-Eastern area &quot;be  included but hopes that it may befound possible to carry out the operation for a somewhatlower figure.   Ha warns us, however,  that every yearfe delaywill add at least  1,000,000 to the coat.  The interest and sinking fund charges in respect of this expenditure fall tobe borne by the industry; in Sir Jj Snellrs opinion when thetime arrives for the full financial charge to be felt, thegrowth of supply will have so greatly increased that theaddition to the cost per unit of generation and supplyattributable to the eoat of standardization, will be almostnegligible a11.     &quot;Sir John Snell has also estimated that during theperiod of the construction of the transmission system, lae.upto 1934/35, the aggregate amount of the savings in the costof generation which will hare resulted from the adoption ffthe scheme may be put at  12,000,000 plus a further sum of 1,500,000 saved to undertakers after amortization of capitalon oertain existing stations to be shut down. &quot;Sir John Isalso satisfied that when the scheme has been brought into full operation in 1940, the cost of electricity to the oon-sumer should everywhere he materially lower than it wouldhave been had the scheme not been undertaken.  He has furtherreminded us that in 1924 it was calculated that in 1940 theschema would show a reduction in the (1924) average pridhe per unit of 2*047,to ldQ or less.   He now estimates that thepresent average price of lo60d^ should be reduced in 1940 to                           -2111 average price of 0.8aU   L&amp;o   The Central Electricity Board-, while they cannotcommit themselves to a responsibility for Sir J, Snellrsestimates of  12,000,000 and  1,500,000, are of opinionthat the amount of the savings in question will be satisfaotorv
As regards the price of current per unit, the  Board wishto emphasize  (1) that Sir John1s figures are averagefigures; end  (2) the importance of avoiding any suggestion which might lead the public to think that -under the scheme the ordinary  lighting consumer will be able to obtain currentat anything approaching the average price..13.     Explanations have been given to us in  regard to the substantial inc.rea.se in the number of selected stations now contemplated  over the number of those stations which the WeirReport estimated would be necessary.14a     The President of the Boar?, of Trade wishes attentiondrawn to the fact that the Gas industry is pressing for legis-labioa removing a number of disabilities under which it operatesand giving it new powers.  Some of the claims, not unreasonableon merits especially in view of the Electricity Supply Act, arecomplicated and controversial.; and these cannot be dealt within the present Parliament.   But the more the  Government advert-ise  the success of their electrical policy, the more the gas industry will complain that they have been unfairly treated*15. .    To sum up it may with safety be stated -        (a) That schemas covering ^/3rds of the population            of the supply of the country are already approved.        fb) That schemes covering all but 3fo of the population            and supply will have been prepared &quot;by June, 1929.        (c ) That the figures as to the cost of the &quot;Grid1 are            likely to be substantially realised, although the            cost of standardisation of frequencies will be            higher than was anticipated due to growth of            systems since 1923/4.        (d) That the estimates as to d;he reduction in cost of            generation are 3-ikelydfc least to be realised:,        (e) That no difficulty has been found  in inducing            undertakers to accept responsibility for the            provision of selected stations&apos;;  on the contrary            there&apos; has been keen competition for the privileged-

Y/e are satisfied for the reasons givsn by  tho      Minister  of Transport, that  satisfactory progress  has teen      made  by the Electricity Commissioners and  the  Central      Electricity Board in implementing the provisions of  the      Electricity (Strpply) Act 1926,.   We are also  convinced that      the Commissioners and  the Board are doing  everything in their      power to  expedite the  scheme,  and that it  would be unreason-      ablo  to expoot that the scheme  could  be still  further expedited      before next summer  by  the adoption  of measures other than      those now  contemplated by the  Commissioners and the  Board.

ELECTRICITY BOARD COMMITTEE.           For the information of the Committee appointed under Cabinet Conclusion 52 (28) 2 to consider the present position of the work of the Central Electricity Board under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926, I have thought it well to obtain a Report from the Board, of which a copy is attached.           It will be seen from paragraph (1) that schemes for four areas have already been approved covering over 34% of the total area of the country, 64% of the population and nearly 68% of the present sales of current.          . At my request the Board have embodied in their Report an estimate which I obtained from Sir John Snell, of the further&apos; progress in connexion with the submission of schemes which is likely to be made by the end of June next.   It will be seen that by that date it is expected that schemes will have been submitted covering substantially the whole country.           The value of contracts already placed is approximately  3 millions and it will be seen from the figures on page 4 that further substantial orders will be placed in the spring of next - year.           In view of the immense amount of work involved In the preparation of these schemes and the time necessarily occupied In negotiations and In obtaining wayleaves after schemes have been approved, both the Commissioners and the Board are,  I think entitled to claim that the provisions of the Act of  1926 are being rapidly translated into practice.
          It will be observed from paragraph  8  of the Reportthat the first actual supply given by the  Board will probablybe available In the early part of next year.                                       (Intld)   71, A.5th December, 1958.N

- Z -Adoption of  2-.   Under the 1926 Act it is the duty of. the-&apos; Central ElectricitySchemes by   Board:-the central board.             (l)  to publish the Schemes as received from the Electricity             Commissioners and to consider the Schemes in the light of repre-             sentations which the parties affected by them may make;                  (2.)  to adopt the Schemes,  with or without modification,  in             the light of representations that have been made;  and                  (3)  having adopted the Schemes,  to construct the works and             to implement the Schemes.                  The Board has now adopted, with certain modifications,             Schemes for the four areas:-                          (a) Central Scotland,                          (to). South-East England.                          (.c) Central England, and                          (d) North-West England and North Wales.                  Prior to adopting the Schemes the Board has,  in each             instance, followed procedure designed.to., enlist the- help  and co-             operation of the undertakings affected by the Schemes,  and they             gladly acknowledge the help which they have received from the             undertakings, without which such rapid progress as has been made             would not have been possible.                  As soon as a Scheme is received from the Commissioners it             is published and also circulated to undertakings in the area             affected.   The Chairman,  with the Chief Engineer and Secretary,             visit the chief undertakings for the purpose of preliminary             explanation and discussion.  In the four areas already dealt with,             150 of these visits have been made, with the result that  many mis-             conceptions, both with regard to the Act and the Schemes,  were             cleared away, and an atmosphere was created for considering the             Schemes oh their merits.  Every encouragement was given to the             undertakings to examine the Scheme closely and make their formal             representations to the Board as complete as possible.  All the             undertakings who raised any point of substance at all in  their             representations vrero interviewed by the Board as a whole  before             the Scheme was adopted.  In all 116 formal Conferences of this             kind have been held between the Board and the undertakings in the             four areas already dealt with.   In addition, of course, there             have been numerous technical discussions between the Engineers of             the Board and the undertakers.   The statement which the Board             issued when adopting the South East England Scheme is appended             (see appendix II) as an example of the consideration which the             Board has given to the representations made.  In no case  haB             any undertaking felt it necessary on a Scheme beingfinaHyadopted by             the Board, to lodge any complaint with a, view to arbitration             under Section 4 (.3) of the Act.                  It should bo added that the Schemes as framed by the             Electricity Commissioners have required relatively little             modification, and in determining on such adjustments as they have             made on the Schemes, in the light of the representations  re-             ceived, the Board has had the advantage of the closest consulta-             tion with Sir John Snell,  the Chairman of the Commissioners.
     In the South East England area and the North West England area,criticism has been directed mainly against the estimates  of futurte growthadopted by the Commissioners * These estimates, taken as a whole, are within the estimates of the Weir Report which formed the basis on whichthe whole proposal for an  inter ^-connected national system was based. TheBoard recognise that the estimated growth is rttadaatental to the financialsuccess of the Scheiaes, and. they feel  satisfied that, with, reasonableindustrial development, thi growth estimated by the Commissioners will bereached or surpassed, though a ocavtinuance of the industrial depressionin Lancashire or in other  areas might  postpone somewhat the date ofrealisation,.                                                  *     -T-htf following table shows the diminution in the number of generating stations which is expected to result wiiea the Schemes are in full working order :r-i 1 1 &apos; Scheme ! i ........ - -	Number of stations now functioning in the area.

In  addition to the constructional  work involved in the BoardTstion of      transmission  system under  the Schemes already adopted, considerable$Frequency    expenditure will need to be incurred in the Central Scotland area and  in expenditure  the Central England area,  and also  some expenditure in North West            England, to effect the standardisation  of frequency provided for in            these Schemes.   This expenditure arises because several of the principal            undertakings  in these areas - for example,  the Glasgow Corporation  and            the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company in the Central Scotland area;            the Birmingham Corporation and  the  Shropshire, Worcestershire  and            Staffordshire Electric Power  Company, in the Central England area; and            the Stalybridge, -Hyde, Mossley  and  Dukinfield Tramways and Electricity            Board in the  North West England area -  have systems that have  boon            developed in  the past on  a 25 cycle or  other non-standard frequency  and            must  now be converted to  a 50 cycle frequency&apos;to obtain the full pone-        &apos;   &apos; fits  of  inter-connection under  the  national Schemes.   The I926 Act pro-            vides for the cost of this change-over  being defrayed  by a general levy            on all the  authorised undertakers of -the country assossod in proportion                                                                     .&apos;  *       1   to/
to the revenue of the respective undertakings.  The Central board is empowered under the Act to advance the sums necessary to effect this standardisation of frequency and to recover interest and sinking fund on the sums so advanced through the ElectricityCommissioners by means of the levy referred to.     The gross expenditure on this standardisation of frequencyaccording to the latest available estimates,  will be approximatelyas follows:-                Central Scotland .....   3,781,200                Central England ..____   4,336,700                North West England ...     452.,000It is expected that the majority of this expenditure will bo in-currod within the next 5 or 6 years,  but work has already com-menced in both the Central Scotland and Central  Aigland areas.The expenditure already advanced or approved by the Board on this account is as follows:-Sub-divisions of	Exp conditions tur		3 advanced	3r approvedexpenditure.

The Board have recognised that Societies  and Local  Authoritiestransmi ssion    who take a special interest in the preservation of rural  amenitiesline and      &apos;  would be agitated by the erection of a vast  transmission  systemrural amenities.throughout the country.   They have taken the advice of Sir                Reginald Blomfiold,  M. A. ,  R. A., on the design of  their towers and                on any steps to bo taken to try to harmonise the towers and  the                transmission lines with the country through  which  they are passing                They have also welcomed.representations from Societies and Local                Authorities concerned in the preservation of amenities and have                offered to co-operate with them in the choice of the route for the                lines.  The most difficult areas are,  of course, the Lako District                the ,South Downs and Epping I?orest, but there is every  prospect of                co-operation which will obviate sorious difficulty arising.  Tho                Spping Forest Authorities have already,  in fact, adjusted with the                Board the line of route through the Forest.Wayleaves.      6. Tho rate at which programmes of work can  be carried out in the                construction of the transmission line is dependent in  large                measure upon the obtaining of the necessary  wayloaves  and con-                sents.  This is, of course, at all times,  and for  all  electrical                Undertakings, a very troublesome business, but the Board  have                every reason to be satisfiod with the progress they have  made in                the two areas in which their construction work is  already                advancing.

APPENDIX  I.CENTRAL SCOTLAND ELECTRICITY SCHEME,  1927-      The  first  Scheme  considered by the Board, the Central Scotland Electricity Scheme,  1927, comprises the whole of the Scottish industrial, shipbuilding and  coal  field districts-   Its total area covers about 4,98C square miles and extends from Montrose and Brechin to &quot;the southern boundary  of Ayrshire,  embracing a population of 3,761,200.    With the exception of Aberdeen  it includes the principal municipal undertakings and power and distribution companies in Scotland,  as well as the area of the Ayrshire Electricity Board.   It also covers the agricultural districts  of Forfarshire and Perthshire which are now without any general supplies  of electricity.      In place of the existing 36 public generating stations, generation will  be concentrated at 10 existing selected stations,  although this number may  eventually be reduced to 8,  and there will also&apos; be 2 new capital stations,  one  in the east and one in the west of the area.   The transmission system,  256 miles in extent, will be by ring mains in order to give greater security against possible breakdown,  the conductors having a minimum capacity of 50,000 kilowatts at a pressure,of 132,000 volt In connection with the transmission system there will be 14 transforming stations.     The Scheme provides for the conversion of the frequency of- supply of eleven undertakings  (notably the Glasgow Corporation and the Clyde Valley Company) from 25  to the standard 50 cycles.     The Board received the  scheme from the Electricity Commissioners on 12 April,  1927,  and after considering various representations made withregard to  it adopted  it with certain minor modifications, on 1 July, 1927.              SOUTH-EAST  ENGLAND ELECTRICITY SCHEME,  1927.     The second Scheme considered relates to the area,  of South-east england.    It  covers an  area  of 8,828  square miles,  the population atthe last census being 11,392,561.    It  embraces the whole  or part ofthe counties  of Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire,Essex, Hampshire, Hertford, Huntingdonshire, Kent, London,  Middlesex,Suffolk, Surrey and Sussex.   It thus  covers the densely populatedmetropolitan area, the London docks, the potential coalfields of Kent,a considerable mileage of electrically equipped railways, a large ruraland agricultural area, and important provincial and  coast towns.     Within the scheme are the areas of supply of 165  authorised under-takers, 93 *f these being wholly or partly within the  area  of the Londonand Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority.    Apart from generating stations used exclusively for:railway  and tramway purposes  the areacontains 135 public supply stations, of which it is proposed to utilise31 as selected stations,  adding to these 4.new capital stations.   Asa temporary arrangement 12 further existing stations will-be utilised for varying periods during the transitional  stage.    The main transmissionsystem extends to 768 circuit miles and takes into particular account the special features of the densely populated metropolitan area.     In view of the probability of extensions on a large scale it alsomakes provision for enabling the Board to afford supplies of.electricityfor electrified railway lines.   As in the Central- Scotland Scheme, theminimum carrying capacity of - the lines  will - generally be .50,000  kilowattsand the voltage 132,000.    But as  regards the metropolitan area,  whereoverhead transmission will not be  practicable,&apos; the pressure,of supply has still to be determined.   &apos; Certain .3.3,000 volt; secondary lines  are                              &apos;     &apos;:        ,   ; &quot;&quot;  &apos;  ------ - &apos;  Also
also contemplated as a supplement to the primary system./  Forty-ninetransforming stations will be associated with the primary transmissionsystem and 20 such stations with the secondary -system.    Mo provision is made in the scheme for the standardisation of frequency.&apos;     The Board received the scheme from the Electricity Commission on29 September, 1927, and published it on 4 October.   Detailed considerationled to certain modifications being made, and a memorandum issued bythe Board on the subject of these accompanies these notes.   The schemewas republished in its adopted form on 17 February, 1928.                 CENTRAL ENGLAND ELECTRICITY SCHEME, 1928     The third  Scheme transmitted, the Central England Electricity  .Scheme, 1928, embraces an area of  7,311 square miles and a populationat the last census of 5,218,146.    It contains the important industrialregions around  Birmingham and includes the counties of Leicester,Northampton, Stafford, Warwick and Worcester, in addition to large partsof the counties  of Derby, Nottingham and Salop, and smaller parts OfBedford, Buckingham, Chester, Gloucester and Oxford.     The Scheme  includes the whole or the major part of the areas ofsupply of 49 authorised undertakers.   The greater part.of the areabeing within the statutory limits  of existing organizations having.rightsof supply in bulk and otherwise over wide tracts of territory it. is,however, with these organizations, rather than with individial under-takers,. that the primary transmission system is designed to deal.  Ofthe. existing 46 public generating  stations, 19 become selected stationsunder the Scheme, and these stations, together with a further new stationto be erected by the West Midland  Joint Electricity Authority at Ironbridgewill, it is expected, eventually supply the area.   It is contemplated that, the main load will be borne by 4 stations, namely, Ham&apos;s Hall,Ironbridge, North Wilford and Stourport.   During a transitional period the selected stations will, be reinforced by six further stations.   Themain transmission system, the design of which will follow that of theformer schemes, extend to 424 circuit miles,  and will be supported bysecondary transmission lines at 33,000 volts.   There will be 19transforming stations in use in connection with the main transmissionsystem and 6 transforming stations with the secondary system.    the frequency of supply of 5 of the undertakings  in the area (includingBirmingham and the Shropshire, Worcester &amp; Staffordshire Company) willbe gradually standardised.     The Electricity Commissioners transmitted the Scheme to the Boardon 13 March, 1928,  who published it on 21 March;  and followingconsideration of representations made and conferences with undertakers,the Scheme was adopted by the Board with slight modifications on31 May,  192 8,NgRTH-WEST ENGLAND &amp; NORTH WALES    ELECTRICITY SCHEME,  1928.     The fourth Scheme dealt with covers the district of North WestEngland and North Wales.   It comprises an area of 9,082 square milesand a population at the last census of 6,980,925.   It extends from theScottish border to the county of Radnor and the northern boundary of theCentral England Scheme in the South and stretches from the coast of wales in the west to Northumberland, Durham and Yorkshire in the east.It thus includes the densely populated industrial area of Lancashire
as well as extensive sparsely inhabited country principally in thenorthern part of the area, most of which is at present without any system of electricity supply.     The Scheme includes the areas of supply of 12?, authorised under-takers and the Electricity districts of South East Lancashire,  MidLancashire and North Wales and South Cheshire.   Out of a total of 70public generating stations 27 have been selected, to which will be addedtwo new stations to be  erected at Manchester and Liverpool respectivelyOf these it is expected that 10 stations will take the main lead.Supplementing the selected stations, 6 coal fire stations and  2 hydroelectric stations will be worked temporarily for the Board during  the transitional period.   the main transmission system is, as in  formerschemes, designed to provide alternative routes so as to give  greatersecurity against possible breakdown and extends to 384 circuit  miles.In connection with the main transmission system there will be  29transforming stations, and there will also be 24 transforming  stations in connection with secondary 33,000 volt transmission lines which  willbe constructed.   The scheme provides for the standardisation  offrequency in one undertaking.     The Electricity Commissioners transmitted the Scheme to the Boardon 16 June, 1928.   It was published by the Board on the 23 June,  whoadopted it with slight modifications on 23 October, 1928.

Appendix II.CENTRAL  ELECTRICITY BOARD.ELECTRICITY (SUPPLY) ACT, 1926.             MEMORANDUM                  ON THESouth-East  England  Electricity  Scheme,  1927,  as adopted by the Central Electricity Board.           LONDON:PETNTED BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;8 STATIONERY OPPI0B
SOUTH-EAST  ENGLAND  ELECTRICITY  SCHEME,                            1927.  The Electricity Commissioners transmitted their  Scheme forthe South-East&apos; England area to the Central Electricity Board on29th  September  last and, as is their  duty under the  Act, theBoard published  the Scheme, as they  had received it, on 4thOctober, giving  notice that they were prepared to receive  repre-sentations from authorised undertakers and other persons interestedby the 15th November.  Since 15th November, the Board have held conferences with theundertakers who made  representations  and have  examined theScheme closely in the light of the representations made, and  in thelight  also of inquiries which, by the courtesy of the owners, theyhave  been permitted to make at many of the undertakings  in thearea.  The Board have now  adopted the  Scheme with  such  modifica-tions  as their examination of it has led them to deem desirable asa result of the representations, conferences and inquiries.  With the Scheme  the  Electricity  Commissioners forwarded  aseries of supplementary particulars giving details of the mannerin which  they would  propose, on the data then available, thatthe Scheme might  be worked, together  with financial  estimates.In  a  prefatory memorandum to  these supplementary  particularsthey  also  indicated, inter  alia, their  views  as  to the  growth of demand to be  expected in the area, and as to the main factors to be taken into account in  determining  what  stations  for  thepurposes of the Scheme should be  selected stations.  In  preparing  the   Scheme and  forecast of  progress,   theCommissioners based  their  calculations  on the latest availablefigures those  for  1925-26---and   made  allowances  for improve-ment.  in  working.    In  commenting on  these  supplementaryparticulars, many of the undertakers pointed out that the rate ofimprovement  in  their efficiency was in fact  greater   than  thatassumed by the  Commissioners.    The  Board  therefore thoughtit right to inquire into the progress which had been made..  Theyacknowledge   the  assistance which  they   have received  fromundertakers both Municipal  and  Company in  their examinationof  the  working. results which have become available  since theCommissioners&apos;. scheme was  prepared, and of the stations in theirpresent state  of  equipment and development.   From  the furtherinformation thus obtained two points became clear :         (1)  that the  improvement in individual stations  which the    Commissioners, on the basis of the 1925-26 figures, had fore-    shadowed  was  conservatively  estimated  and is  in  process of    being attained : and
       (2) that the rate of growth of consumption upon which the     Commissioners  had worked, is, in the  early years, and  tak-     ing the area as  a whole, conservative rather than optimistic.  As a result of the  conclusions  reached  after considering the representations  and conducting these further investigations, theBoard were  satisfied  that  the  Scheme  in its  general outline  is sound, but that certain modifications in detail could advantageouslybe  made.   They believe that  these  modifications  will  conduceto  the ends  contemplated by the  Commissioners in the  scheme,and will tend to widen the basis for that  co-operation between theBoard and the undertakers in the area which is essential  to rapid progress.  The modifications can be grouped under the following heads    Existing Selected Stations. The Commissioners proposed thatof the 135 public supply generating stations existing in  the area 13should be selected,  and that a further 15 should be employed to supplement the operation of the Scheme, in the same manner asselected stations,  for a period  of  years  without  being  actuallyselected.  As a result of their  investigations  and inquiries the Board aresatisfied  that  several  of  the  municipal  stations,  included in thelatter  15, offer facilities  for  advantageous  expansion, and thatbenefits would&quot; on the whole be  secured to the Scheme by making these 15  stations  selected stations and developing the  facilities ofsome of them for the  general purposes of the Scheme.   In addi-tion,  the  Board have  thought  it well to  select the  stations atFulham,  Maidstone  and Bedford; these  stations   can  usefullycontribute to  the  Scheme,  particularly  having regard to theirsituation.  Since there is, as has already been indicated,  a possibility thatthe  growth of  consumption  will  be in  excess  of the  Commi-s-sioners&apos; estimates rather than  below  them, the  Board feel thatit  is  expedient  for them to have under  their permanent controla greater  margin  of existing  plant  available to  meet this  possibleexpansion than the  Scheme at first provided,  and that,  so faras  extensions to plant are concerned,  it is advisable  to  retaincomplete  flexibility.  They have come to the  conclusion,  there-fore,  that rather than  schedule  extensions at present they  shouldbe  guided by  the experience that will be available of the  actualgrowth and its location.  The information  which has  been  obtained in  respect of  theadditional selected  stations  satisfies  the  Board that  in  making them fully selected  stations they  will ensure an elasticity  whichwill be of very definite advantage to  the working  out of  theScheme without impairing its financial stability.  Temporary  Arrangements. It was  clear  from the  representa-tions  received   that   there  was  considerable  misapprehensionas  to the object of  the provision,  and genuine fear that  the
proposed  temporary  arrangements  might  be  so  operated  as  to prejudice non-selected stations and deprive them of the protectionwhich parliament had given them in  Section 14 of the Act.  TheBoard  did not consider that these fears were  well  founded andbelieved  that as  the undertakers became more familiar with  the-working  of  the Act, such  fears  would have  disappeared.    but since, in any event, in  the operation of the Scheme, the Board  donot feel that it will be necessary for them-to rely oh any temporaryarrangements with  stations except in order to obtain a  supply from surpluses available at some stations to assist others in advanceof the  complete construction and  full operation  of the main  trans-mission system they have modified the clause so as clearly to limitits scope to this purpose.  New  Selected  Stations. Impressed with the need to see that existing  undertakings  were  afforded  the  fullest opportunity  ofmaking economic contribution to the Scheme, the Board examined with special care the  existing riverside sites.  They found thaton several of these sites further expansion could advantageouslybe encouraged  in  the interests  of the  Scheme  as  a whole beyondthe limitations by which, up till  now, local, authorities have beenbound.in providing only for their own immediate  needs.   On onesite,  in particular,  namely  Fulhaan,  economic  development of avery large order can be undertaken.    In view  of   its locationand proximity to the load to be met in the West&apos; of - London (with consequent  important saving in the cost of the transmission sys-tem) as well as in the  light of its advantages  in other, directionsthe Board have felt it right to rely for the  present on the develop-ment of the Fulham site and the extended use of others in substitu-tion  for  the station  which  the Commissioners had  scheduled  atChiswick for 1934-35.   Though certain restrictions on  the  use of the Chiswick site hadbeen imposed by Parliament, yet  the Board would  have felt obligedto include a station on  this site but for the fact that  the 1926 Actgives new facilities for the development of  the sites of  existingselected stations in the interests of the area as a whole which werenot  available to the  London and Home  Counties  Joint electricity authority or tinder the consideration  of the Commissioners whenthey first provided for the erection of a station at Chiswick.   Transmission System. Certain variations  have been made inthe route of the  lines,  both as  a  consequence of the  modifications which  the Board have made in the Scheme and as a result of repre-sentations bearing upon technical considerations.
