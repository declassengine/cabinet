COPY NO:       C.P.255 (28).                           CABINET.                   LIMITATION Off NAVAL ARMAMENT.               A DRAFT FOR REPLY TO NOTE FROM GOVERNMENT                         OF THE UNITED STATES.          (Prepared by the Foreign Office for the  Cabinet Committee           on Policy in regard to Reduction and Limitation of           Armaments) (Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of           the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs).          His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain have given     their most careful consideration to the Note  from the Government     of the United States, dated September 28th, 1928,  on the     subject of the compromise proposals put forward by His     Majesty^s Government and the Government of the French Republic     relating to  the limitation of naval armaments.          His Ma^estyTs Government appreciate the  frank: and friendly     terms of that note,  and are  glad to find that,  although  the     Government of the  United States are unable to accept  the     proposals as a basis of discussion by the  Preparatory Commission     for the Disarmament  Conference,  there  is nevertheless a  large     measure of agreement between the  two Governments.    In particular     they  agree in holding that  limitation of naval armament, to     he really effective,  should apply to all classes of oombatant     vessels.    It is hardly necessary to recall that the  original     proposals put forward by His Majesty&apos;s  Government  at  the     meeting of the Preparatory Commission in March,  1927,  no less     than  those which they advocated at the  three-Power  conference,     were  &quot;based on the  division of warships  into a number  of     categories embracing every kind of armed vessel.    Similarly     the proposals which  they submitted to  the  French Government     in March 1928, while  reducing the  number of categories,  still
 provided  for  the  inclusion  of  all  classes  of  combatant  vessels. The  two Governments are further  at one  in  their desire  to abolish the  submarine altogether, or,  if that is unattainable,,  to subject it to drastifl limitation and His Majesty1s Government gladly reiterate  their willingness to co-operate  in  any  steps  which the Government  of the United States  may be  prepared to take with the other interested Powers in order tc secure the largest measure of limitation of submarines of all  types.      His JiJajesty^ Government do  not,  on  the other hand, wholly share the view that, in the absence of  agreement  on a complete scheme of limitation applicable  to  all  types  of combatant vessels, a  scheme of partial limitation would serve no useful purpose.  The Washington Conference, which left several classes of warships unlimited, is a signal  example of the value of the methoi. of proceeding by stages in  this  difficult matter.  It was with this consideration In mind  that His Majesty1s Government were prepared to make Important  concessions and to accept pro- posals which fell short of what  they had themselves consistently advocated,  and would have preferred.  While admittedly leaving large classes of war vessels unlimited  the Anglo-French compromise proposals nevertheless had the advantage of carrying one stage&quot;further the application of the principle established at Washington, In that they added to the two classes there subjected to lim- itation, two further classes, namely, the more powerful cruiser and the larger submarine; and this  extension  of the principle appeared to His Majesty1 s Government to be worUx discussing at Geneva since agreement on a more complete  scheme seemed for the moment unattainable.  In considering these or other proposals for   pftrtlai- limitation it must be borne in mind that, inadequate as they may seem in relation to  a hitherto unattained ideal of comprehensive limitation, they may yet  represent a substantial advance from the existing position.
    ^ii/hile, as His MajestyTs Government have &quot;been pleased to note, there exists between them and the Government of theUnited States an identity of views on many matters of principle,His Majesty*s Government regret that on one point of substance,namely the classification and limitation of cruisers/ there remains a difference between  the views of the two Governmentsv/hich arises, from&apos; diversity in the respective needs of thetwo countries.   The present would not be an appropriateoccasion for re-opening discussion of the technical pointsinvolved 1?- this question, but His Majestyrs Government arereluctant to believe that no way can be found for adjustingthis difference in a manner satisfactory to both Governmentssand they are ready at all times to give careful and sympathetic consideration to proposals having that end in view.     His Majestyls Government are no less anxious than theGovernment of the United States that the special circumstancesof individual Powers should receive due consideration, and theyshare the view that each nation is the &quot;best and &apos;only authoritative-tive judge of its particular needs.   His MajestyTs Government,who could not divest themselves of any part of their own.responsibility in this respect, would be the last to expector desire others to do so.   While, therefore, they can onlyregret that the Anglo-French proposals were considered to be suwhas would place the United States at a disadvantage, they warmlywelcome the assurance that the Government of the United Statesremain willing to use their best efforts towards an. agreed basisof naval ^limitation.
     WOT their part Hig, Majestyrs Government,deeply concerned as they are at the failure t*,reach agreement hitherto on a general scheme for thelimitation *f armaments, will always remain readyto consider fresh proposals.   They have taken note of the suggestion made &quot;by the Government of theUnited States and, although it is one which they&amp;T.Q knoYvTi previously to have rejected, they are willing to examine ,it&apos;again, as  they are willingto examine any other suggestions which may he putforward with the view of promoting the cause of disarmament - a cause which they regard as being of&apos; supreme importance from both the national arriinternational standpoints.Foreign Office, 3.W. 1.,              November 14th, 1928.
