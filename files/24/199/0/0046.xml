No.__2^- *&quot;                               CJ^B I N K To p,396 (28) .              Proposed Establishment of a Trade Commissioner  Post at                                   Dublin.   Memorandum by,the President^of the Board of Trade.   1. Recent events in the economic development of theIrish Free State emphasize the necessity of appointing arepresentative of His Majesty&apos;s Government In Great Eritainto be stationed at Dublin.   2. At the present time there is no political or, commercialrepresentative of Great Britain in the Irish Free State. Thisconstitutes a very serious lacuna in the commercialrepresentation of this country, in .view of the fact that, next to Australia, our exports to the Irish Free State are biggerthan those to any Dominion.  The following figures for theyear 1927 show the magnitude of the trade between GreatBritain and tho  Irish Free State, and the proportion which itbears to the total external trade of the Irish Free States-     Total Imports from all sources to      the Irish Free State..................    60,822^032       Of which from Great Britain..........    40,613,800     Total Exports to all destinations      from the Irish Free State,,...........    44,168,118       Of which  to Great Britain............    37,368,326These figures are exclusive of the trade between NorthernIreland and the  Irish Free State.    3. It would be desirable,  in view of the great volume of,this trade to appoint a commercial representative at Dublin.In this connection it may be  remarked that the United States,Canada  and France  are all represented at Dublin, where theUnited  States, have a Minister, France a Commercial Attache
and Canada a Trade Commissioner.  Furthermore theAmerican Senior Trade Commissioner in London has inrecent years spent lengthy periods travelling in the IrishFree State.  The Government of the Free State has recently announced Its intention of appointing Ministers in paris and Berlin, whose duties will Inolude trade and commercialrepresentation.  His Majesty1a Ambassador In Berlin hasalso reported the intention of the German Government to convert their consulate general in Dublin into a Legation.   4. The lack: of a commercial representative leads to various grave disadvantages to the detriment of british trade.  There exists at present no adequate means ofobtaining commercial information about the Irish Free Statefrom official sources.  There is no direct communication between the various Government departments in this countryand the corresponding departments in Dublin, and it isunderstood that the Government of the Irish Free State are opposed to the development of any direct contact.  Thus all information in regard to Government regulations affectingtrade and commerce reaches this country through the officeof the Irish -free State High Commissioner in London.  Inpractice this system has proved totally inadequate, informa-tion of the highest importance being either delayed intransmission or not furnished at all.  Consequently, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain are not kept properlyinformed as to legislation proposed or accomplished affectingtrade matters.  For instance, in view of the trend in theIrish Free State  in favour of protecting local industriestariff legislation is a matter of vital importance.  It isessential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be Informed atthe  earlieBt possible date in regard to any applicationsreferred to the  Irish Free state Tariff Commission or ofany  deoisions  issued by that Commission.
1 OQloo      In addition to actual changes in tariff duties, both His Majesty&apos;s Government  and also the trading community in this country are  interested in all matters either directly or indirectly  affecting the importation and  exportation of goods to and  from the Irish Free  State, e.g. restrictions on and control of import and export  of goods,  including those for sanitary and similar purposes;. temporary importation regulations or any other special customs facilities;   internal  and excise taxes affecting imported goods;   pure food regulations so far as they apply to imports.      It is  vital to  traders in this country to be  notified as early as  possible of impending changes in  official regulations  and  also of changes  when made-    Information of this character  in the case  of the other Dominions^and of Foreign  Countries is made regularly  available to His Majesty&apos;s  Government through their  Commercial Representatives   5.   The  figures quoted  earlier in this memorandum show that  the Irish Free  State  is an  important  customer of and supplier to  Great Britain,  and,  that  in  fact the bulk of the  external trade of the  Irish  Free  State  is carried on with  Great Britain.     Until comparatively recently,  it has been possible,&apos; even  since the formation of the  Irish Free  State and the adoption of  an import  tariff, to  consider this trade, from many points  of view, as being still part of the  internal trade of the United  Kingdom.   Certain changes are, however,now maturing which may be expected to alter very  radicallythe nature of the trade which it  will be possible  to  carryon with the Irish Free State.    The Shannon electrical
I189 scheme is nearing completion,  and it is the avowed intention of the Irish Free State Government to use the power generated by it for the  industrialisation of the Country.    This may be rendered possible by the considerable surplus of power  which will be available. The Irish Free State will,  no  doubt, remain principally an agricultural country,  filling Its needs for fully manufactured goods mainly by importation as formerly. A certain degree of industxlalisation must however be expected, bringing with it great  changes in the nature  and quality of the goods  imported.    As an example,  it may suffice to  say that electrical maohinery and  other types of machinery for industry  are likely  to be required in  entirely new directions in  the near  future.    Competition from  all  quarters  is to be expected  for the supply of these goods,  and as  Germany has hitherto supplied the technical material  for the Shannon scheme, she  starts with a strong advantage in regard to  all machinery and plant likely to be required to make the scheme  industrially effective.     The  absence of  a commercial representative in dublin will in these  circumstances prove a gravedisadvantage to British trade as the D.O.T. have atpresent no  source of  information as regards openings forBritish trade in the Irish Free State or the competition of foreign trade rivals.     The following figures indicate the increase whichhas taken place during the last few years in the importsfrom Germany and the United States  into the Irish FreeState.
Imports fromGermanyU.S.A. 745,0005,709,0001925888,0003,096,00019262,300,0004,956,00019271,496,0004,658,000     The figures for 1926 were abnormally large  owingto the purchase of (a) coal from Germany and theUnited States as a result of the English coal strike,and (b ) large quantities of machinery from Germany inconnection with the Shannon Scheme.   6.   Finally, in the absence of  a political representative, the Trade Commissioner in Dublinwould, on receiving instructions from the Board  ofTrade through the Dominions Office,  make informalrepresentations to the Government of the Irish FreeState on tariff and commercial questions - a courseof action which has been attended with considerable success on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Trade commissioners in the other Dominions,   7.   On these various grounds, the urgent necessityof appointing a Trade Commissioner  at Dublin at  theearliest possible date is clearly proved.    The  rank of this officer should be that of a Trade Commissioner,grade I, on the scale salary of  1,200 rising by annualincrements of  50 to  1,500,  so as  to  make his rankcorrespond to those of the Senior Trade commissioners in the remaining Self-Governing Dominions.
   8-  The estimated oost of the proposal is shown onthe attached schedule, from which it will he observedthat the total permanent annual cost of the scheme would amount to about  3,200.     In addition there would be non-recurrent expenditureamounting to about  770 in connection with the installation of the Trade commissioner and the equipment of his office.   9.  The earliest date on which the post could beestablished would probably be the beginning of January.  Thiswould involve an approximate addition of  1,570 to thecost of the services borne by the Department of Overseas Tradeduring the present financial year, namely one quarter ofthe permanent expenditure and the whole of the non-recurrent expenditure.  This total of  1,570 could be met out of savings on the Department&apos;8 vote for 1928.  On the otherhand permanent provision for this post would entail theaddition of  3,200 to the estimates of the Department for1929.
