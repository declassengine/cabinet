[This Document is  the Property of His Biitanaic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 18, 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    28CP.  411  (28).                    THE  CHINA BOXER INDEMNITY.            NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                  (Reference:  Cabinet Paper No. 377 (1928).)    THE Chancellor of the Exchequer submits a simple suggestion for the solutionof the Indemnity question.   The money is to be spent for the &apos;&apos; mutual benefit ofGreat  Britain  and China.&quot;  Therefore, let  Great Britain take  the paid part ofthe money and let China have the unpaid part.    But this is an excessive simplification, in that it ignores the past history ofthe question.   In  the first paragraph of his memorandum the Chancellor of theExchequer ignores  the main objection  to the  confiscation of two millions of the indemnity fund in order to pay for the Shanghai Defence Force.  That objection isthat such  action would  involve a  flagrant violation of all  the  definite promiseswhich His Majesty&apos;s Government have publicly made on the subject of the Indemnity,and that such a breach of our pledged word would have the worst possible effect onour relations with the new Government of China and consequently on British tradewith that country.    These promises (see  list attached) have been of a progressive character.    In 1922 we promised the Chinese authorities, both verbally and in writing, to devote the funds to &quot; projects equally beneficial to China and Great Britain.&quot;   the written promise was at  once published.   In  1925,, by  the Act  of that year, wepromised to apply the funds to &quot;educational or other  purposes beneficial to the mutual interest of His  Majesty and to  the Republic  of China.&quot;   In 1926 wepromised, by the published statement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,that the allocation and administration of these funds (which under the 1925 Act wasto be in the hands of the Foreign Office in London) should be placed in the controlof an Anglo-Chinese Board of Trustees  in China.    It is the habit of His  Majesty5s- Government to keep their promises; and evenif the  proposal of the Chancellor of the  Exchequer could, with an effort, be squaredwith our  promise  given  in 1922, it certainly conflicts with the promises given in1925 and 1926.    Since  the Chancellors  proposal cannot be carried out without a breach of faithto the Chinese of  the first magnitude, and since in 1922, as a matter of fact, theTreasury  and  the  British  taxpayer definitely surrendered their  claims on  the indemnity, the Chancellor is surely estopped  from trying  to  recover  for  theExchequer a part of a fund which a previous Chancellor had definitely surrendered.The fact of the surrender is a fait  accomxpli; it is definitely settled that we cannotreclaim our exclusive right to the fund or any part of it.  Our difficulties duringthe past year have been to arrange the details of the remission of the Indemnity inthe face of continually changing circumstances  in China.  Our latest  proposals,therefore,  dealt not with the objects of the fund, but with its control,   tinder theAct of 1925 it was to be  controlled absolutely from London.  In 1926 it was agreedthat it should be controlled by an Anglo-Chinese Board of  Trustees.  My present proposal is that it should be controlled by the Chinese Government.    Accordingly, the paper circulated by Lord  Cushendun dealt with this questionof control and was not intended to  reopen the question of the&apos;objects on which themoney should be spent.  These objects are very generally understood both in thiscountry and in China  as  being objects of an educational or cultural character with provisions- for a permanent endowment through  investment of a portion of the funds in productive undertakings such as railway construction.  There has been no question       4694  [18633]                                                  B
at any time in, the public mind either here or in China of using the funds either forsatisfaction of British claims or for the expenses of the Shanghai Defence Force.    As  regards control, we  found that control from London was so distasteful toChinese opinion that it would  have spoiled the whole purpose for  which we wereremitting the Indemnity. In its place the proposal was accepted that a Board of trustees in China should be  appointed, though it was fully realised that our controlover the Board could not be very effective.  To carry out this proposal an AmendingAct would be required, and  a Bill was prepared with this object.  But for  various reasons it has not been found possible to proceed with it.           t              ,    This prolonged delay  has  given  rise  to  much  misunderstanding andmisrepresentation, and  as it is now  recognized that any scheme of joint  control would not be effective  and, likely to produce friction, as explained  in  the lastmemorandum circulated  to the Cabinet,  it seems  best to drop the above-mentionedBill and to introduce another amending Bill surrendering to the Chinese Governmentwhatever rights of control we  might  have had under  the Board of Trustees plan,and to make the best arrangements we can to ensure that the money is in fact  devotedto objects of mutual benefit  to  Great  Britain and China.    This proposal is condemned  by  the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   But  hiscondemnation is based on the assumption that there is no longer any question of using the money for educational purposes  for the mutual benefit of  Great Britain and china, and that the China  of  to-day, with its intensely nationalist point  of view;would not tolerate any scheme for using the money for educational and other purposes for the mutual benefit of Great  Britain and China.    There is, however, no justification for this assumption.:    Sir Miles Lampson,  in his  telegram No.&apos; 1393 of the 28th November, states :          &quot; I anticipate  that Nanking Government will be only too  ready  to agree    to any terms within reason we might attach to unconditional surrender, though    naturally I cannot guarantee that they or their successors would adhere to them.    If that policy is formally approved, I suggest the  best thing to work for would    he  a voluntary declaration by the Chinese of their&apos;  intention to apply  the    recommendations of the Advisory Committee  (Command  Paper 2766)  in its    entirety plus undertaking to place such orders as might arise  thereunder,    railway construction,, conservancy work, &amp;c,  in Great Britain.  Until I have  :&apos;  been able personally to  sound the Government. of Nanking, I  cannot predict    possibilities, but I  think we should be able to get the above, or something like    it.   I agree that if this policy is adopted we should cease to have any  form of    control of funds. Such control would, in my opinion, be ineffectual in any case,    and, in all probability,  merely lead to continuous  friction.&quot;      Sir Miles  Lampson, therefore,  does not agree  with the Chancellor  of  theExchequer as to the hopelessness of  expecting nationalist  China to carry out  theprogramme recommended by Lord Buxton&apos;s Advisory Committee.  On  the contrary,he  says :  &quot;I think we should be able to get the above,  or something like it.&quot; Thisproposal, as a matter of fact, had already been suggested by Lord Buxton himself.     This disposes of the Chancellors main criticism that  it is impossible now tohave the funds applied for the objects  which we  had in view at  the time. of  the surrender of 1922, the Act of 1925 and the Advisory Committee&apos;s Report of 1926.     Nor is it admitted that the case made  in the Foreign Office memorandum of January last has been destroyed.  The chief argument m  that case was  that  the distinct repudiation of a public promise would damage the whole  structure of  our China policy.  This is ignored by the Chancellor in his present memorandum; it is still the decisive argument.  It is believed that the repudiation of our promise would be  a  serious set-back to our improving relations with China.     The Chancellors memorandum gives the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Minister at  Peking is opposed to the  remission of the Indemnity, for in paragraph 3 he quotes from Sir M. Lampson&apos;s telegram No. 1673 of the 28th November, 1927, as  follows :  &quot; It is on the face of it absurd, and even wrong, voluntarily to return to the Chinese  a  huge  sum,  in itself a reimbursement of former actual  British expenditure, more  or less  in the nature of  a free gift of  11 million to the Chinese at the expense of the  British taxpayer.&quot;  But he omits to quote the following sentence in Sir M. Lampson&apos;s  telegram: &quot; Nevertheless, my  feeling is that, having gone so far and advertised  our  intention urbi et orbi, it would be hazardous and difficult to go back on our promise  now.&quot;   In one. of Sir M. Lampson&apos;s latest telegrams  (Nanking telegram No. 50 of  the 10th December), he says (regarding the less radical proposal to appropriate the
paid funds for the benefit of Hong Kong University):  &quot;It would be regarded asgoing back on our plighted word, delay in fulfilling which  is  already  causingcriticism which is not easy to meet now that China is practically united.&quot;  Needlessto say, these words apply still more forcibly to the Chancellor&apos;s proposal to confiscatethe funds in order to pay for the Shanghai Defence Force.    The Chancellor says that it is now admitted that it  is not possible to carry intoeffect the Act of  1925.   But this was admitted as long ago as 1926, when it wasdecided in principle to introduce an Amending Bill, in order to transfer the controlof the funds to the Board of Trustees in China (see list of promises attached No. 5):The difficulty of using the 1925 Act now is that we cannot deal with the funds onany large scale by control from London, when we have promised that they  shall be controlled in China; and the terms  of the Act are apparently too rigid to allow ofany compromise.   This phase of  the situation was made clear  in a reply given bythe Secretary of  State  for  Foreign Affairs to a question asked in the House ofCommons on the 4th July last (copy attached); this statement has been given wide publicity in China.    In conclusion, the arguments against the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposalmay be resumed as follows : &apos;    1. There is the promise which wisely or rashly we have made and repeated           in the ears of China and the whole world, that the whole of the  funds           are to  be remitted for the mutual interests of China and Great  Britain           for  &quot;educational and other&quot; purposes,, and  not applied to a purely           British purpose.    2. The Chinese, rightly or wrongly, regard these funds as  Chinese money (are           they not paid out of  the Chinese Maritime  Customs revenue?);  they do           not regard them as we regard them here, as British money given to China,           but as  Chinese money remitted by  Great Britain (as, indeed, by all the           other Boxer Protocol Powers) in consequence of China&apos;s share as an ally           in the War.    3. The Indemnity question  is not a solitary question, it is part, of our  whole           China policy.  Especially since our Christmas Memorandum of 1926 the           China policy of  His Majesty&apos;s Government has assumed a very definite           shape;  it is a policy of encouragement and friendliness to the new  China           of which the Nanking Government is now the  representative, and  a policy           of tidying up the abnormalities of the past  so as to hasten on  the  day           when China will take an equal place among the great countries  of the           world.   Slowly  the  Chinese  Nationalists  have come to  recognise  the           friendliness  and sincerity of our  attitude.   Our  relations with them           have greatly improved, and the general outlook for the future  is quite           promising.   An  important part  (in  Chinese  eyes)  of  our China  policy           is this question of the Boxer Indemnity.  If  we go back  on our promises           in this matter merely because  it suits us, obviously  the  whole fabric of           British  reputation in  China will be shaken,  since if we go back on  one           promise it is the natural inference that we are quite likely to go  back on           any others that we may have made.    4. It must be remembered that all other countries who shared in the imposing           of the  Indemnity after the  Boxer  riots have now surrendered their           balance, either unconditionally as in the case  of the enemy Powers, or in           the  interests  of educational  or  cultural work (the United States  of           America, Japan, Russia),  or other constructive works of  public utility           (Belgium, Holland, Italy).   France alone applied her share to refloating           the  Banque Industrielle,  which  had  gone  bankrupt  in  discreditable           circumstances, but this  did not benefit the taxpayers at home.    5. In order to carry out the Chancellor of the Exchequers scheme it will be           necessary to repeal the 1925 Act and make other statutory provision for           the  disposal of the money.  Even if,  as suggested by  the Chancellor,           this could  be done by a clause  in the Finance Bill,  the object of such a           clause  must become apparent, and  the ensuing debate would hardly           redound to the credit of His  Majesty&apos;s Government, either in China  ..... ,    or here.      .    n        &apos;  *   ,  &apos;  .,   ,           4  &apos;1 -  -&apos;&apos; &apos;    - - J! *    Foreign  Office, December 17,  1928. &quot;&apos;[18633]

THE following promises have been given :-   &apos; 1.  A verbal assurance given to the Chinese Acting Minister for Foreign affairs at Peking on the 20th December, 1922, that &quot; the British Government had decided inprinciple  to devote the proceeds of the British share of the Boxer Indemnity toprojects equally beneficial to China and Great Britain.&quot;    2.  Written promise to the same effect, dated the 29th December, 1922, in a noteaddressed by His Majesty&apos;s Legation to the Chinese Foreign Office.        (N.B.--rThis  assurance was at once published in the press.)    3.  Promise made by the  whole British  people, as embodied in the  &quot; ChinaIndemnity (Application Act, 1925,&quot; that the &quot;China Indemnity shall,  instead ofbeing paid  into the  Exchequer  ....  be applied to such educational or  other purposes,  being purposes  which are, in the opinion of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, beneficial to  the mutual interests of  His Majesty and of  theRepublic of China, as  the said Secretary of  State, after consultation with  theAdvisory  Committee  to be established under  this Act,  may  from time  to  timedetermine.&quot;    4.&apos;  This promise  was confirmed      (i) by the setting up of the Advisory Committee under the chairmanship of          Lord Buxton.                          -. -    (ii) by the sending to China of the committee&apos;s; delegation under the chairman-          ship of Lord Willingdon to study on the spot details for carrying out the      &apos; -   ACT.     -      - -&apos;                      ..        -     -       &apos;    This latter step in especial advertised our Boxer Indemnity promises in the eyes of the whole world, and  especially of China.  The specific promise made by  theSecretary  of State for Foreign  Affairs, and published on the  26th May, 1926, toaccept the principle of control of the funds by a Board of Trustees in China and todo his best to secure Parliamentary approval to this proposal.      ANNEX II.Parliamentary  Question.                              BOXER INDEMNITY.    CAPTAIN CROOKSHANK asked the Secretary of State  for  Foreign Affairs what action he proposes to take with a view to carrying out the recommendations of theBoxer Indemnity Commission ?    SIR A. CHAMBERLAIN:   His Majesty&apos;s Government  desire to  carry  out  therecommendations of the Buxton Committee, and to  pass,  as soon as possible,  thelegislation  required for putting them into effect by the creation  of a Board of trustees, to be established  in China.   They regret the prolonged delay which  hasoccurred.  But this has not been due to any change of policy or lack of interest inthe question on  their  part.   They have been prevented from taking the necessary action solely by  the continued uncertainty of the conditions prevailing in China.Neither the proposals of the Advisory  Committee nor their financial stability havebeen thereby prejudiced in any way.  The Advisory Committee is still in being,  andits proposals can be carried  into effect as  soon  as the necessary amending Act is passed.
    In the meanwhile, the Advisory Committee have been examining the situationand considering whether, in anticipation of the passing of the amending Act, therewas any possibility of initiating some preliminary work or of undertaking some ofthe minor  proposals which have been approved of by the Advisory  Committee.It has,  unfortunately, been found  impracticable, for various  reasons, to act onany of the suggestions put forward with this object.in view.   As already stated,however, the recommendations of the Advisory Committee are unaffected, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government are only awaiting the moment when conditions in China willenable them to proceed with the action required for putting those recommendationsinto  force.    Wednesday,: July 4, 1928.
