N E ,T             gQTJg^ DP LORDS REFORM.       Memorandum by tho Lord Privy  Seal.     The  tarms of Lord Claro-adonTs motion which I mentioned at the Cabinet last Wednesday have now  appeared upon thepaper and I append them to this noto.    It  will be seen thatthe motion is divided into two paragraphs.   Number one is astatement of the general oonditions whioh in the opinion ofthe movers should govern, the reform  of  the  personnel of theHouse, and number two gives an example  in detail which themovers suggest would fulfil these conditions.    So far asnumber two is oonoernod I presume that  the  Cabinet would wish us not to he in any way identified with it.    But,  sofar as I oeuld collect It, the general  opinion  expressed lastWednesday was in accord with the provisions of  number one -that is to say the principle of a limitation of tho totalnumber of Peers by seme system of election  suoh as at presentobtains In the case of Scotch Peers, and in addition to  this the principle of the representation of  each  political partyby nomination of Lords of Parliament or fey  some other repre-sentatlvo preooss.   I suggest that  the Cabinet should  givethe Ministers in the House of Lords authority to  acceptnumber one while securing the elirnitutnion of number two.                                             S.D-december 3rd, 1928.
