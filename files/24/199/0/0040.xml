390 (28).CLAJLLJLJL1.         Announcement as to, Qruiser Typo.  MsmoraadiiBLky tho First LmlI-sIJI          The only question before the Cabinet is whether ornot it can now be announced that the two cruisers of the 1928programme are to he of 10,000 tons displacement.          Such announcement will he unnecessary unless aquestion is asked, hut unavoidable if a question is put, asit is essential that the preliminary work of ordering material,,etc.5, should he begun immediately.          The Cabinet has already, after the most carefulconsideration by a Cabinet Committee and by the Cabinet itself,definitely decided, in May last, on the construction of two cruisers&apos;of 10,000 tons and 8-inch guns in this year?programme, instead of the one 10 ,,000 ton and two 8,000 toncruisers proposed in the original building programiM ef 1925-,          .The House of Commons has been informed of thereduction of the programme from 3 cruisers to Z, and has &quot;votedthe necessary moneyo  But the Cabinet desired that theannouncement of the type should he held up pending thenegotiations for signing the  Kellogg Pact,  The only matter which the Cabinet wished to he kept temporarily frompublication was the question whether these two ships were tobe of 10,000 tons or 8.000 tonso          On this it is suggested that we should re-open thewhole question of our Naval Programme for this year.  TheAdmiralty,working on the instructions of the  cabinet have made all their arrangements accordinglys and the time baa                                                     arrived.*,.

Hj &apos;J                         -2- arriTed when  the materials must  be  ordered.  To  reverse  the programme at  this  time  makes  the  administrative  work  of  my Department  impossible,  and could only  be  justified  by the gravest reasons of public policy.          Nothing  has happened since the  Cabinet decision which would establish the desirability of reversing it.   On the contrary, we have been told  by  the Americans that  they will only build cruisers of 10,.000  tons and Scinch  guns, the smaller 8-inch gun  cruisers being  now discarded by them,          The only advantage  suggested is that to drop them might be a gesture acceptable to 17.3=1. and likely  to  modify their building policy.  I can see no reason to suppose that it would have that effect.  Every proposal  ^e make toXLS.A. is received by them with  the utmost suspicion,  and such a move at a time when the Pact and the Navy Bill  are under discussion would  in my  opinion be at once  described by the Big Navy Parly as an insidious attempt to put them off their guard, and induce them  to modify their Navy Bill, and they would&apos; get more support in consequenceB          The only course for us to pursue is the consistent course we have pursued  of making such provision  for the safety of our Empire and our  Trade as we  think requisite.          The building  of these two cruisers will bring us to a total of fifteen 10,000  ton cruisers and two smaller ones, all with Scinch guns..   This number  is as near as we car- get to the 5:  3 ratio with Japan, and satisfactory on  that account if we are able later  to extend that Washington ratio to ships now outside the convention.          As compared with America the position  in the next few years will be as follows, if the Navy Bill passes:-.                                                   8-inch....

Those who think we can then overtake the AmericanStrength by increased and rapid construction seem to ovelook the fact that the first moment any marked increase is known,suspicion will be aroused all over the world, and the Leagueof Nations will want to know what is the reason for it.          Moreover, in the years 1935, 1936 and 1937 no lessthan 20 of our light cruisers will become obsolete and requirereplacement.  In addition to this the replacement of battle-ships under the Washington Treaty will be due to begin at approximately the same date.  So that any acceleration in building 8-inch cruisers would coincide with the period when an increased effort would be necessary in the 6-inch type andin replacement of battleships.          The Admiralty hold the strongest opinion that thesetwo 10,000 ton cruisers should be built now, and that if theGovernment wishes to preserve our equality with U.S.A. in-inch gun cruisers beyond 1932, there ought to be 3 more8-inch gun cruisers built in 1929.          If, however, the Government are prepared to acceptthe position at the end of 1932 of 17 8-inch cruisers to 18of the U.S.A., the Admiralty would be willing to lay down                                                      thre e. - .
 three 6-inch gun cruisers in 1929 which will he required for Fleet work, and, if it is insisted on to announce it now. They are also prepared to show a reduction of about  1,000,000 in next year&apos;s estimates which will still include provision for the two large cruisers of this year.          This is not the occasion for1 discussing in detail next year1s estimates, which I hope to do very shortly  with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  But it may assist my colleagues to know the two facts which. I have just statedo          There is another aspect of the question - that of labour - which at a time like this we cannot afford to ignoreeSince 1924 it has been my painful duty,  in the interests of economy, to reduce the number of men employed in the Royallards by 8,000.  I have endeavoured to mitigate the hardship involved by making the reductions as gradual as possible.  But it has been my aim to arrive at a situation before the end of this Parliament where the numbers can be stabilised, and by careful apportionment of work between the Royal lards andShipbuilders outside this has now been accomplished, and a.comfortable position secured for the next year or more for labour in the Royal Yards.  The announcement that theseCruisers are not to be built will at once make it manifest to the Dockyards that they are  faced with the prospect of inevitable and sweeping discharges within a year and causewidespread dissatisfaction and bitterness,  as practically everyman in the yards will feel that his own  employment  is in jeopardy.          But the blow to employment is  not confined to - the dockyards.  It is computed that at least 80$ of the cost of ships of war is expended in  wages - in the  yards and in  thepreparation of materials and manufacture of armament outsidenThe wages, therefore,  provided by building these two ships will amount to  about  3,500,000 in the next two  or three years.                                                      The...
The materialsj guh mountingst  etc.,  are largely obtained fromthe Tyne and Barrbw, and as soon as  the orders can &quot;be given,employment will he found for hundreds of men in two of themost distressed districts.  The manufacturing firms are nowexpecting these orders, as they are  aware from announcementsin the House of Commons that there are to he two cruiserslaid down this year.          One can imagine what the commentary would he, ifit were announced that the Government had reversed their decision at the very time when they  were calling upon all employers to make every effort to engage more men.          I can think of no adequate defence which I could put forward in the House of Commons  for the reversal at this moment of our declared policy.                               W. 0.  B.ADMIRALTY,  SiW.l.    15th  December 1928,
                19,29 mrf OHJIgPVR G0NSTHJ0&apos;T,T.0N.;-.          The White Paper of 1925 on the programme of new construction, Command 2476, made provisional proposals forthe laying down in 1929 of cruisers:-                     Class &apos;A!......1                     Class &apos;B&apos;......2          On Cabinet 64(27) it was decided that the programme for 1929/30, as set forth in the White Paper of 1925, should remain unaltered, &quot;hut this would not prevent the Chancellorof the Exchequer, or any other Minister, from bringing thematter up for discussion&quot;.          Since this decision was given there has been achange in the general naval position; owing to the proposed new construction programme of the United States having passed through the House of EepresentativeS.          If the proposed American building programme is authorised, 5-10,000 ton 8&quot; gun ships will be laid down ineach of the years 1929, 1930 amd 1931.  This will result inthe United States naval strength in 8U gun cruisers being 23in 1934, all of the 10,000 ton (Class &apos;A5) type.          A one-power standard in 8&quot; gun ships with theUnited States requires that we should lay down 3 of these ships during each of the financial years 1929/30 and 1930/31.This would give us 23-8&quot; gun ships in 1934.         &apos; As regards the type of.vessel, that is Class &apos;1&apos;or Glass &apos;B&apos;, we now have two Class &apos;B!  of 8,400 tons building.This Glass was introduced in 1925 as a means of economy at atime when the American 8&quot; cruiser programme had not beensuggested and when the Japanese Programme only had to be takeninto consideration.  The intention was to build a sufficient number of Class &apos;A1  cruisers to give us superiority to theJapanese in that type and in addition to provide a number of                                                      less...
                                                            1 s-iq                        -7-                                 4L (li Jless expensive  8&quot; gun cruisers chiefly for employment on thetrade routes,          When taking into account, however, the Americanbuilding programme, we cannot continue to build the smallertype of 8&quot; gun cruisers for work on the trade routes, as ifwe did we should fall behind a parity standard with the UnitedStates in the more powerful 5A&apos;  class type.  Further, if latera restriction of 8&quot; gun ships by international agreement&quot; was arranged we should find ourselves in an unfavourable position with a number of Glass &apos;BJ cruisers, whereas the United states would only have Glass &apos;A&apos;.          If, therefore,  the American proposed building pro-gramme passes the Senate,  it is recommended that the provisionalbuilding programme of 1 Glass &apos;Af and 2 Glass TB&apos;  for 1929 shouldbe changed to 3-10,000 ton Glass JAT cruisers.          If, on the other hand, the American programme is rejected, the position as regards 8,f ships requires considerationonly, in regard to  the next naval power. Japan.          In 1932  Japan will have 12-8&quot; gun ships, including4 of the &quot;Jmrutaka&quot; type  of 7,100 tons carrying six 8&quot; guns.We to-day have built and building 17-8&quot; gun ships, two ofwhich approximate  to the &quot;Purutaka&quot; type,  and in addition havethe 4 &quot;If f inghams!t.          Our relations with Japan are good and seem likelyto remain so, and  it is therefore considered that, so far asthat country is concerned, we can afford to suspend the building of 8&quot; gun ships for the present.          ;&apos;/e require, however,  in order to attain our numbers,to lay down 3 ships in 1929.  There are certain duties with themain fleet for which a small cruiser is more suitable than alarge one.  For night operations, as for example,  the shadowingof enemy heavy vessels, searching for the  enemy fleet and                                                   supporting...
supporting our attacking force, the small cruiser has theadvantage over the large cruiser of being less conspicuousand handier.  Moreover, at night, the small cruiser is usuallyas dangerous to an enemy of any class as is the large cruiser^There are other operations, in a day action, for which a smallcruiser may he as suitable as a large one...  The mostimportant operations in this class are the support of ourown destroyer flotillas during attack, and the attack uponthe enemy destroyer flotillas.          The Admiralty therefore recommend, so far as japan is concerned, that the building programme for 1929 should be changed from 3-8&quot; gun ships to 3-6&quot; gun ships.          The alternative cruiser programmes for 1929 thereforeare,(a) if the American proposals go through and if theCabinet are not prepared to face the position in 1932 of our having 17 8 inch cruisers to 18 of U.S.A. that we should lay down 3-6&quot; 10,000 ton cruisers in 1929, in order to maintainthe one-power standard, (b) if, on the other hand, the Billdoes not go through the American Senate,  or the time for itsmaturing is considerably extended, then it is considered thatwe could, without undue risk, proceed with a programme of3-6&quot; cruisers in 1929.
