MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    IT will be recalled that, in the telegram to the Dominions of the 16th November(D.O. No. 553), the despatch of which was approved by the Cabinet at their meetingon the 14th November (Cabinet 51 (28), Conclusion 5), it was intimated that it was hoped that preliminary documents would be circulated to the Dominions in about amonth&apos;s time.    I now  circulate to my colleagues copies of two memoranda  drawn up at my request, in a  form intended  to  be suitable for issue to the Dominions,  by theappropriate  Sub-Committees  (under the  Chairmanship  respectively  of Sir  C.Schuster and Sir C. Hipwood) of the Inter-departmental Committee which has been examining the whole subject.    These memoranda contain, so  far as  possible  in a non-controversial form,  a survey of existing legislation on the subjects with which it would appear that the expert-Committee and Sub-Conference will have to deal.   They do not contain any recommendations or suggestions as to the future, nor do they contain any matter byway of comment other than is necessary for the explanation of the existing position.    In the circumstances  I  propose, in  the  absence of  any comments  from mycolleagues before the end of this week, to communicate  these documents forthwith tothe Dominions as preliminary material for consideration preparatory to the work ofthe Expert  Committee and Sub-Conference.    The full Report of the Inter-departmental Committee, which will, I understand,contain a critical analysis of the position and proposals for,the consideration of theGovernment prior  to the meeting  of the Expert Committee and Sub-Conference, isnot likely to be ready for a few weeks.

Confidential.INTRODUCTION.     1. The Report of  the  Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the ImperialConference of 1926 recommended that steps should be taken  by Great Britainand the Dominions to set up a Committee with terms of reference on the following lines :       .                    &apos;                   \  - i    &quot;To enquire into, report upon, and make  recommendations concerning       &quot; (i) Existing statutory provisions requiring reservation of  Dominion legisla-             tion for the assent of His Majesty or authorising the disallowance  of             such legislation.      &quot; (ii) (a) The present position as to the competence of Dominion  Parliaments     -       to give their legislation extra-territorial operation.           (b) The  practicability and most convenient method of giving effect to             the  principle that each Dominion Parliament should have  power to             give extra-territorial  operation to its legislation in all cases where             such operation is ancillary to provision for the peace, order, and good             government of the Dominion.      &quot; (iii) The  principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity             Act, 1865, and the extent to  which any provisions of that Act ought             to be  repealed, amended, or modified  in the  light of the  existing             relations between the various members of the British  Commonwealth             of Nations as described in this Report.&quot;    2.  In order that material might be prepared for circulation  to the Dominionsbefore  the meeting of  the proposed  Committee, a preliminary survey of theexisting  position  has  been made,  and  the  existing legislation passed by the parliament at Westminster which affects the  Dominions has been examined  insome detail.    3.  Below will be found a list of the  subjects with which it is thought thatthe proposed Committee will have to deal.  Examination has shown that they mayconveniently be grouped as follows :       I.  The Law relating to the Sovereign and the  Royal Family.     II.  Certain  aspects of Imperial Defence.             (a)  The Armed Forces of  the Crown.             (b)  The Law of Prize.             (c)  The Foreign Enlistment Act.    III.  Nationality.     IV.  The Judicial Committee.      V.  The Official Secrets Acts.    VI.  Legislation relating to the removal of  Criminals.             (a) The Fugitive Offenders Act.             (b) Extradition.             (c)  Colonial Prisoners Removal Acts.    VII.  Miscellaneous.            (a) Certain Acts relating to Evidence.            (b) Bankruptcy.          -  (c)  Companies.            (d) Coinage.            (e) Industrial Property.            (/) Air Navigation.
   VIII. Certain legislation of which the operative effect is mainly in relation to           foreign territory.             (a) Foreign Jurisdiction Acts ^:   J ;             (b) Extra-territorial jurisdiction in  respect  of  offences  on land                  committed by British Subjects.             (c) Statutory functions of British Consular Officers.  &quot;&apos; -v:   -&apos;   :  IX. Constituent  and  Federating  Instruments  (including  the  Colonial           Boundaries Act, 1895).  Reservation and Disallowance.             (a) Provisions in Dominion Constitutions.             (b) The Colonial Boundaries Act,, 1895.            .  ...   ...             (c) The Prerogative of Mercy.             (d) The Colonial Stock Acts.    4. In  the succeeding chapters an attempt has been made to set out the sub-stance of the law and practice  now relating to the subjects enumerated above ;but no attempt has been made to examine the principles which underlie that bodyof law and  practice.  It is hoped that the resulting epitome of the existing situation may prove to be of assistance to His  Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions in preparing the ground for the Committee of Experts.December, 1928.
CHAPTER  I.THE  LAW  RELATING  TO  THE  SOVEREIGN  AND  THE ROYAL  FAMILY.                    A. THE SUCCESSION TO THE  CROWN.    1. The principal Act relating to the succession to the Crown at the present time is the Act of Settlement,  1700 (12 &amp; 13 Will. Ill, c.  2).  By this Act it was declared  that the Princess Sophia; Electress: and Duchess Dowager of Hanover,daughter of  the late  Queen of Bohemia, daughter  of  James I,  was next in succession in the  Protestant line to the  Imperial Crown  and  dignity  of  theRealms of  England, France, And Ireland, with  the Dominions  and Territoriesthereunto belonging after King William III and the Princess Anne of Denmark,and in default of issue of the said Princess Anne and of the King respectively ;and  that the Crown  and legal  government of the  said   Kingdom   and  theDominions  thereunto belonging should be, remain and continue, to  the PrincessSophia and the heirs of her body being Protestants.  By Section 2 it was enactedthat all and every person and persons who should inherit the Crown by virtue ofthe limitations declared by the Act and who should be in communion  with the see or Church of Rome or profess the Popish religion or become a Papist shouldbe subject  to the incapacity established by the Bill of Rights (1 Will. &amp; Mary,Sess. 2, c. 2).   Section 9 of the Bill of Rights excluded the persons mentioned forever from  the  Crown, and absolved their subjects from their  allegiance, and provided that the Crown should descend to the person who, being Protestant,would have inherited the same if the person so excluded were naturally dead.    2. By the Act of Union with Scotland,  1706 (6 Anne, c. 11), the succession tothe Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain  and of the Dominions theretobelonging was declared to be that enacted in the Act of Settlement.  By the Act of union with Ireland, 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. Ill, c. 67), the Kingdoms of Great Britain andIreland were  united into  one Kingdom by the name of the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Ireland and similar provision was made for the succession to theCrown of the  United Kingdom of Great Britain and  Ireland and of the Dominionsthereunto belonging.  The legal position as to the  succession to  the Crown wasunaffected by the Acts establishing the Irish Free  State ;  but Section  4 of  theGovernment of Ireland Act,  1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. V,  c. 67) expressly prohibits  the parliament of Northern Ireland from making laws in respect (inter alia) of the Crownor the succession to the Crown.    3. The only other Act which it appears necessary to mention is 1 Mary, Sess. 3,c. 1, which  enacts that  the kingly office of the realm,  and all dignities, prerogativesroyal, powers, pre-eminences, imvileges,  authorities and jurisdictions, thereuntoannexed, being invested either in male or female, are as fully, wholly, absolutelyand entirely deemed, adjudged, accepted, invested and&apos;taken in the one as in theother, thus  enabling the succession to pass in the female as well as in the male line.
                         B. THE CORONATION  OATH.    4. By 1 Will. &amp; Mary, c. 6, it was provided that an oath in the prescribed formshould be administered to every King or Queen who should succeed to the throneat their respective coronations by one of the Archbishops or Bishops of the  realmto be thereunto appointed by such King or Queen respectively and in the presenceof persons attending,  assisting or otherwise present at the coronation.  To  the coronation oath was added a declaration against the doctrine of transubstantiationand other Romish doctrines according to the form  set out in 30 Car. II, Stat. 2, c. 1,with a proviso that if the Sovereign at the date of his or her succession to the Crownwas under the age of 12 years, the declaration should be made and subscribed athis or her coronation,  or on the first day  of the meeting of the first parliament which should be held after he or&apos;she  attained the age of 12 years.    5. By Section 2 of the Act of Settlement, 1700 (12 &amp; 13 Will. Ill, c. 2), theearlier statutory provisions as  to the coronation  oath and the declaration againsttransubstantiation were re-enacted ;  but by the  Accession Declaration Act, 1910(10 Edw. VII &amp; I Geo. V, c. 29), a modified form of declaration was substituted.    6. By the Act of  Union with Scotland,  1706, it was further  provided that every Sovereign should at his or her  coronation take an oath to maintain  the established Church of England and Scotland, respectively.  By the Act of union with Ireland, 1800, the established Churches of England and Ireland were unitedin one Protestant Episcopal Church called &quot; The United  Church of England andIreland,&quot;  and the  oath required to be taken by the Sovereign  at his  or  hercoronation for maintaining the established Church of England accordingly appliedthenceforward to the United  Church of  England and Ireland.   The  union ofthe  two  Churches  was,  however,  dissolved by the  Irish  Church Act, 1869(32 &amp; 33 Viet., c. 42), and the Sovereign^ oath, therefore, has, since that date,had reference to the Church of England alone. The Church of England has, sincethe Welsh Church Act, 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. V, c. 91),  ceased to include the Churchso far as it extends to and exists in Wales and  Monmouthshire.                                C. REGENCY.    7. By the lords Justices Act, 1837 (7 Will: IV&amp;  1  Vic. c. 72), it was providedthat, if at the demise of Her Majesty the next successor entitled to the Crown shouldbe out of the realm, certain great officers of State should be constituted and appointedLord Justices of the United Kingdom and empowered  until such successor should arrive or otherwise determine their authority to exercise and execute all powersand acts of Government in as whole and ample manner as such next successor wouldbe able to exercise or  execute the same if  he or she were present in person withinthe United Kingdom.   Certain limitations were placed  by the Act upon the powerof the Lord Justices, and, in particular, they were forbidden to dissolve  parliament or to  give the Royal Assent to any bill or bills for repealing,  changing or in any respect varying the course of succession to the Crown as established by law.  ThisAct appears still to be in force.                                  v   .    8. On the accession  of King George V the heir apparent was still under the ageof 18  years and provision for a Regency in the event of His Majesty dying beforethe heir to the Throne had attained his majority was accordingly made by the regency Act, 1910 (10 Edw. VII &amp; 1  Geo. V, c. 26).  This Act provided that if anychild of King George should succeed to the Crown while under the age of 18 years,Her Majesty Queen Mary should be the guardian  and have the care and tuition ofsuch child until the child attained the age of 18 years, and have  full power and authority in the name of  such child and under the style  and title of &quot; The Regent &quot;to exercise and administer, according to the laws and constitution thereof, the rule,powers and government of the realm and of the dominions, countries and territoriesbelonging to the Crown, and to use, exercise and perform all prerogatives, authoritiesand acts of  government and  administration of  government that belong to the sovereign of the realm.  It was  also specially provided by Section 4 of the Act(following the precedent of the Lords Justices Act) that the Regent should not giveor have power to give the Royal Assent to any bill for repealing, changing or in any
     respect varying the course of succession to the Crown as established by law, and     further that if her Majesty Queen Mary should after becoming Regent be reconciled     to or hold communion with the See or Church of Rome, or should profess the Roman     Catholic religion or should marry a person professing the Roman Catholic religion,     or should cease to reside in or absent herself otherwise - than temporarily from the     United Kingdom her powers and authorities as guardian of the Sovereign and RegentH   should thenceforth cease and determine.                             D.-ROYAL TITLES.    9. The Royal style and titles have been declared by a number of Proclamationsissued under the Great Seal by virtue of the express authority of an Act of Parlia-ment.  The  principal Acts and Proclamations to which it is necessary to refer areas follows :-    10. Article 1 of the Articles of Great Britain and Ireland which were ratifiedand confirmed by  the Act  of Union with Ireland, 1800, declared that the Royalstyle and titles appertaining to the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and  Ireland, and its Dependencies, should be such as His Majesty by RoyalProclamation under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom should be pleased toappoint;  and a Proclamation was accordingly issued  on the  1st  January, 1801,declaring that the  Royal style and titles should henceforth be &quot; George III by theGrace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, King, Defenderof the Faith.&quot; By the Royal Titles Act, 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vic. c. 10), Her Majestywas empowered, with a view to the recognition of the transfer of the Governmentof India from the East India Company to Her Majesty by the Government of india act, 1858, to make such  addition to  the style and titles at  that time appertainingto the Imperial  Crown of the United  Kingdom and its Dependencies as to her majesty might seem meet ; and a Royal Proclamation issued on 28th April, 1876,declared that henceforth the words &quot; Empress of India &quot; should be added to theRoyal style and titles.   The  Royal Titles Act, 1901 (1 Edw.  VII, c. 15), furtherempowered His Majesty,  with a view to the recognition of His Majesty&apos;s dominions beyond the Seas by Royal Proclamation issued within six months after the passingof the- Act, to  make  further additions to  the Royal style and titles ;  and a proclamation issued on the 4th  November,  1901,  added  after the words &quot; theUnited Kingdom of Great  Britain and Ireland &quot; the words &quot;and of  the british dominions beyond the Seas.&quot;  Section 1 of the Royal and Parliamentary TitlesAct, 1927 (17 &amp;  18 Geo. V, c. 4), authorised  the making within six months afterthe passing of the Act of such alterations as to His Majesty might seem fit ;  and a proclamation issued on the 13th May, 1927, substituted for &quot;the United Kingdomof Great Britain and  Ireland  and of the British Dominions beyond  the  Seas &quot;the phrase &quot; Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas.&quot;    11. The Proclamation of 17th July, 1917, declaring that the Royal house and family should be  styled and  known thenceforth as &quot; the  House  and Family of Windsor,&quot; and relinquishing all German titles, dignities and honours, did not requirethe authority of an Act of Parliament and was not in  fact made in pursuance ofany Act.                           E. -ROYAL  MARRIAGES.    12. By  Section 1 of the Royal Marriages Act, 1772 (12 Geo. Ill,  c. 11)  it wasenacted that no  descendant of the body of King George II, male or female, otherthan the issue of Princesses who had married or might thereafter marry into foreignfamilies, should be capable of contracting matrimony without the previous consentof the Crown signified under the  Great Seal declared in Council, and  that everymarriage or matrimonial contract of any such descendant without such consentshould be null and void  to all intents  and purpose whatsoever.   By Section 2 adescendant of the body of George II being over the age of 25 years may, upon givingnotice to the Privy Council, contract a marriage without the Royal assent at  anytime after the expiration of twelve  calendar months after such notice and  the marriage is valid unless both Houses of Parliament shall before the expiration ofthe twelve months  expressly declare their  disapprobation of it.  Subsequent general
legislation relating to marriages has always contained a saving Clause with regardto  this Act  (see Marriage Act, 1823  (4 Geo... IV, c. 76), section 30 ;  MarriageAct, 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. IV, c.  85), section  45,  and Foreign  Marriages  Act,  1892(55 &amp; 56  Vic. c.  23), section 23).  The Act  applies to  all marriages which fall within  its scope, whether  they are  celebrated  in  the United  Kingdom or inany other country ; Sussex Peerage Case, 1844, 1 Cl.  &amp; F.  85.              F.- THE  OTHER  MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.     13. For all practical purposes (save in the  case of certain treasons referred tobelow),  the members of the Royal Family other than the Sovereign are in the same position as other subjects of the Crown and enjoy no special privileges.  An Act ofHenry VIII (32 Hen. VIII, c. 51), however,  enables the Queen Consort to sue inall cases as a feme-sole in her own Christian name and with the addition of &quot; Queenof England and of France and Lady of Ireland &quot; ; but in an early edition of Chittyon Pleading, cited by Robertson, Civil Proceedings by and against the Crown, p. 6,it is stated she should sue and be sued as &quot; Her Most Sacred Majesty Queen--,Consort of Our Sovereign Lord the now King.&quot;  The Heir Apparent EstablishmentAct, 1795 (35 Geo.  Ill, c-. 125), enacts a curious procedure for  the  purpose ofrecovering debts  owed by the Heir Apparent.  By Section 8 of the Act no action may be brought  against the Heir Apparent himself, but  against his Treasurer orother principal officer or officers to whom the particulars of the claim have  been previously delivered in accordance with the  provisions  of the Act.  Judgment isto be a charge against the funds of the Heir Apparent in the defendants hands, and execution is not to issue against the defendant or his property. It would appearthat, strictly speaking, the procedure laid down  by the Act applies equally whetherthe debts  are contracted  in the United Kingdom or in one of the Dominions.                                G. TREASON.    14. Apart from the  crime of treason in what may be called its political aspect,there are certain offences against the person of the Sovereign and of other membersof the Royal Family which are  treason, treason felonies,  or misdemeanours.   Bythe Treason Act, 1351 (25 Ed. Ill, Stat. 5, c. 2) as extended by the Treason Act,1795 (36 Geo. Ill, c. 7), it is treason for any person either within the realm or withoutto compass,  imagine, invent, devise or intend death or destruction or any bodilyharm tending to death  or  destruction, maiming  or wounding, imprisonment  orrestraint of the person of the Sovereign ;  or to compass  or imagine the death ofthe King&apos;s wife during the life of the King, or of his eldest son and heir, or to violatethe King&apos;s wife during his lifetime, or the King&apos;s eldest daughter being unmarried,or the wife of the King&apos;s eldest  son and heir during coverture.    15. By the Treason Act, 1702 (1 Anne, Stat. 2, c. 21), it is treason to endeavourto deprive or hinder whoever shall be next in succession to the Crown at the  timebeing according to the hmitations established by  law from succeeding after the death of the Sovereign  to the  Crown,  or maliciously,  advisedly and directly by writingor printing to maintain and affirm that any  other person or persons has or have any right or title to the Crown otherwise than  according to the Acts relatingthereto.   By the Treason Felony Act, 1848 (11 &amp; 12 Vic. c.12), it is felony for anyperson within the realm or without to compass, imagine,  invent, devise or intend to deprive or depose the Sovereign from the  style, honours or Royal name of theImperial Crown of the United Kingdom or any other of His Majesty&apos;s Dominionsand countries.   By  the Treason Act, 1842 (5 &amp; 6 Vic. c. 51),  it  is a  highmisdemeanour punishable with various terms of penal servitude or imprisonmentto discharge or aim fire-arms at or near to the person of the Sovereign, or to strike or strike at  him  with any offensive weapon  or in any other manner with intent to injure or  alarm him.                 H. THE  PRIVATE  ESTATES  OF THE CROWN.    16. The private estates of the  Sovereign  as  distinguished from the estateswhich he holds as Sovereign are dealt with in the Crown Private Estates Act,  1862(25  &amp; 26 Vic. c. 37), and the Crown Private Estates Act, 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vic. c. 61).The private estates of the Crown are defined by the Acts as meaning any lands
and hereditaments or other real or heritable property, whether situate or arising in England, Scotland or Ireland, or any other part of the Dominions of the Crown,which have at any time been purchased or acquired by the Sovereign out of anymoneys issued for the use  of the Privy Purse or with any other moneys not appro-appropriated  for any public service, or which shall have come to the Sovereign by giftor devise,  or by descent,  inheritance  or succession, or  otherwise.  Generallyspeaking, the purpose of the Acts  is to assimilate the position of the Sovereign sofar as regards his private estates  to that  of a private individual;  but the Actsprovide that in respect of any private estates of the Crown not vested in Trusteeswherever situate all suits and actions may be &quot;brought or defended on behalf of the sovereign by and in the name or names of any person or persons to be from time totime for that purpose appointed by the Sovereign under the Sign Manual. Section 3of the  later Act further provides  that any suit, action or  other  proceeding inany part of the Dominions of the Crown relating to any debt or liability to or any claim or demand by  the Sovereign in right  or respect of his Privy Purse, or of anypersonal estate or effects subject  to disposition by his last will and testament,may be issued, brought, prosecuted  or taken on behalf of the Sovereign, his heirsand successors, by and in the name  or names of any person or persons appointed in the manner described above.  It would  seem that the provisions of this section(which,  it will be observed, includes  proceedings relating to the personal estate oreffects of the Sovereign) only refer to claims on behalf of  the Sovereign  and notto claims against him ;  but that the general provisions of the two Acts, so far asregards  the claims relating to the Sovereign^ real property, apply equally to claims by or against the Sovereign.(G14432)
CHAPTER  II.       CERTAIN  ASPECTS OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.(1) THE  ARMED  FORCES  OF  THE CROWN.(2) THE  LAW OF PRIZE.(3) THE  FOREIGN ENLISTMENT ACT.                    (1) The Armed Forces of the Crown.    1. As the law now stands the Codes governing the Armed Forces of the Crownraised under the authority of the Parliament at Westminster fall into two mainclasses, those applicable to the Navy on the one hand, and those applicable to theArmy and the Air Force on the other.                               NAVAL FORCES.    2. The  main statute regulating Naval Forces is the Naval Discipline Act.The Naval Discipline (Dominion Naval Forces)  Act, 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. V, c. 47),provides that where a self-governing Dominion has  made  provision  for  theapplication to its Naval Forces of the Naval Discipline Act that Act shall haveeffect as if  references  therein to His Majesty&apos;s Navy and His  Majesty&apos;s Shipsincluded  the Forces  and ships  raised by the  Dominion,  subject  to  such modifications as might  be made by  the Dominion.    Perhaps the chief legal features  that require to be noted are the following      (a)  The Naval Discipline Act, if duly applied by the Dominion Legislature           to the Naval Forces raised by the Dominion, in accordance with the           Naval Discipline  (Dominion Forces) Act,  1911, creates  a system of           naval  discipline for the Naval Forces  of such Dominion which is           enforceable  either within or without the territorial limits  of  such           Dominion.      (b)  In  a  Dominion which has duly applied the Naval  Discipline  Act, an           order to a member of the Dominion Naval Forces to proceed to a ship           or establishment of the Royal Navy would be a lawful exercise of such           naval discipline, and a lawful order which he would be bound to obey.           A person disobeying  such an order whether within or  without the           territorial limits of the Dominion would be committing an  offence           against the Naval Discipline Act as applied  by the local Legislature,           and could be  proceeded against accordingly.      (c)  If a person so ordered should, in fact, proceed on board one of the ships           of the Royal Navy in commission, he would be amenable to the Naval           Discipline Act unmodified under Section 87 of that Act.      (d)  If Dominion  Naval Forces should be placed by  a Dominion  Government            at the disposal of the Admiralty, the Act of  1911 provides that while            so serving they are subject to the  Naval Discipline Act unmodified.      (e)  Recently the Naval Discipline Act, 1922 (12 &amp; 13 Geo. V, c. 37), provided           inter alia that officers and men of the Royal Navy who were serving by            order of the Admiralty in Dominion ships should, whilst so serving, be            subject to the laws and  regulations applicable to the Naval Forces of            the Dominions.
    In  the Acts of 1911 and 1922. the phrase  &quot;self-governing Dominions&quot; is defined  as including the Dominion of Canada, the  Commonwealth of Australia,the Dominion of New Zealand and the Union of South Africa and Newfoundland.    Naval Forces for general service on the high seas have, in fact, been establishedby Australia, Canada and New Zealand under local legislation based on the ImperialAct of 1911.    3.  Previously to the Naval Discipline (Dominion  Naval Forces) Act, 1911,which followed discussions at the Imperial Conference  of 1911, and the arrangementsthen made regarding certain Dominion Navies and co-operation between the ships of the Royal Navy and of the Dominion Navies,  the Colonial Naval Defence Act,1865  (28 &amp; 29 Vic. c. 14), was the main Imperial Act  affecting the Naval Forces ofa British Possession.  That Act made possible, by means of offer and acceptance,to which  effect is given by Order in Council, that  Forces established in  british possesions should come under Imperial control in  any case of  the  undertaking of operations outside the limits of the Possession,  and it  made  provision fordisciplinary powers outside the limits of  Colonial  territorial waters.  The Actwas directed to the establishment of a local Naval Force which may include :       (1)  War vessels.      (2)  Seamen and others for permanent service in such vessels or, in emergency,            in the Royal Navy.      (3)  Volunteers of the nature of the Royal Naval Reserve for service in such            vessels, or,  in emergency, in the Royal Navy.    The Volunteers are nominally part of the Royal Naval  Reserve, but,  except as provided in the Colonial Naval Defence Act itself,  are subject exclusively to theprovisions made by the legislative authority of the Colony as permitted by the Act,but the disciplinary code  of the Royal Navy must be applied to the force whileoutside  those limits.    Under the Colonial Defence Act, 1909 (9 Edw.  VII, c.  19), the force raisedby any  Colony may, if  the Colony so prefers, form a part of  the  R.N.V:R. raisedunder the Naval Forces Act, 1903 (3 Edw. VII, c.  6).    In  1908  the  Governments of  the Cape of Good Hope and Natal passed thenecessary legislation to  establish in each colony a Division of the  R.N.V.R. andthe Union of South Africa continued the R.N.V.R. system and based their arrange-ments in  1912 as to the South African Division of the  R.N.V.R. on the Acts of1865,  1903, and 1909 (Section 22 of the Union of South Africa Defence Act, 1912).    Newfoundland  also  established a R.N.R. (now disbanded) at  the beginning ofthe century, in pursuance of the Act of 1865.    4.  The Irish Free State has no naval forces at  present  : certain Articles  ofthe Articles of Agreement bear on the position in the Irish Free State in the matterof Naval Defence.    5.  There are certain  other Statutes affecting the discipline  and organizationof the Royal Navy and  their relations in certain respects with the civil population and civil  power throughout H.M.  dominions, such  as the Naval Deserters  Act,1847  (10 &amp; 11 Vic. c. 62), and it may also  be useful  to  refer to  certain activitiesof H.M. ships which have been authorised by Statute  (see  Appendix) in order,mainly,  to implement international obligations  or secure  on the  high seas thecompliance of British subjects with Imperial Acts.                         MILITARY AND AIR FORCES.    6.  Regular Forces. The main statute regulating the Army is the Army Act,which lays down a code  of discipline, a  disciplinary procedure  code, provisions dealing  with such matters as enlistment, offences in relation to the forces, imprison-ment  and  the relations  between military  and civil jurisdictions,  together with aseries of provisions designed to regulate the mutual relations of  the members  ofall the  forces of the Crown when acting together or attached from one force toanother.   The Royal Air  Force was created by the  Air  Force  (Constitution)Act,  1917 (7 &amp; 8 Geo. V,  c.  51), which  applied the Army Act to that  Force
-with certain modifications and provided that as so modified it should take effect as a separate Act of Parliament under the short title of the Air Force Act.  the differences between the Air Force Act and the Army Act are not of so substantiala character as to require further reference here.     7.  Reserve and  Territorial Forces. Broadly speaking, when the non-regularmilitary forces are under training or on  service the code of discipline contained inthe Army Act applies  to  them.   Their administration,  conditions of service andenlistment are provided for  in the Reserve  Forces Acts, 1882-1906, and the Terri-torial and Reserve  Forces Act,  1907 (7  Edw. VII, c. 9),  and the Territorial Armyand Militia Act, 1921  (11 &amp; 12  Geo. V, c. 37).  The Reserve Forces  Act, 1906(6 Edw.  VII, c. 11),  provides  that men  of the Reserve  may  be authorised to reside  in any part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions and makes the Reserve  ForcesActs applicable to them when so resident.   It also authorises enlistment in  theReserve to take place  in any part of  His  Majesty&apos;s  dominions &quot; except in  a colony possessing responsible government,&quot; these &quot; Colonies &quot; being given  in  theSchedule to the Act, as amended by the  Order  in Council  of 5th May,  1908, and applied to the Union of South Africa by  the South  Africa  Act,  1909, as TheDominion  of Canada,  The Commonwealth of Australia, New  Zealand, Union ofSouth Africa, Newfoundland.    All these statutes,  save  the Territorial Army and Militia Act, 1921, have been applied with  modifications to the non-regular  air forces under the provisions ofthe Air Force (Constitution) Act, 1917, and the Auxiliary Air Force and  Air force reserve Act, 1924 (14 &amp;  15  Geo.  V,  c. 15), and the position of these forces does not differ in any substantial degree from  the position of the non-regular military forces.    .8.  Dominion Forces. Dominion  Military and Air  Forces are  constituted under various Dominion enactments :  in the case of the Irish Free State Article  8of the  Articles of Agreement bears  on the question.  Under Sections 177  of theArmy and Air Force Acts the code of discipline laid down by a Dominion Govern-ment for its own Military and Air Forces is made effective when those forces  are outside the Dominion, and there is provision for adoption by the Dominion Govern-ment, should it so desire, of  the Army and Air Force Acts with such modifications as the special conditions of  its forces require.    At present  Australia,  Canada  and New  Zealand  have applied the. army act, in whole or in part,  to their  forces ;  South  Africa  has a  Union military discipline  Code, which is a modified form of the Army Act; the Irish Free Stateforces are governed by the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, 1923-1927.    Newfoundland has no Military or Air Forces.              APPENDIX REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH 5.Slave Trade Act, 1824 (5 Geo.

                            (2)-The, Law of Prize.     1. The right of prize is a right of a belligerent,  recognised by  internationallaw, to seize  in certain circumstances enemy or neutral property actually  orconstructively at sea,  and to ask for its condemnation by a Prize  Court (PalwJBranch, 1919, A.C. at p. 277).  The function of a Prize Court is to ensure that noseizure is made in circumstances not justified by international law, and it has thepower of awarding damages to persons injured  by the wrongful seizure  of their property.   In this way a British Prize Court has the duty and power of supervisingand regulating an essential part of the activities of the Royal Navy in time of war.    Thus, the right of prize and the manner in which it is to be exercised in timeof war is an important and indeed essential element in the Naval Defence of theEmpire.    2. The manner in which jurisdiction is  conferred  on Prize Courts in, theDominions and the law which those Courts administer are dealt with in ImperialStatutes which deal essentially with two  matters, the setting up of Courts havingjurisdiction in prize and the nature of the law to be administered by those Courts.    3. With the possible  exception of the  High Court in England,  to which further reference is  made hereafter,  jurisdiction in prize is  conferred  by RoyalCommission followed by Admiralty Warrant.  Before 1864, the creation  of PrizeCourts was  a purely prerogative power, but it is now regulated by  a number  of statues which will now be considered.    4. Throughout  His  Majesty&apos;s dominions, prize  jurisdiction is  exercised byCourts having jurisdiction in Admiralty, and in  order to obtain a comprehensiveview  of the matter  it is necessary  to consider  separately the manner in whichCourts having Admiralty jurisdiction can be created in His Majesty&apos;s dominionsand the circumstances  in which those Courts can exercise jurisdiction in prize.    The Courts in question are :        (a)  The High Court in England (in which is now vested the jurisdiction  of            the High Court  of Admiralty) ;       (b)  Colonial Courts of Admiralty ;       (c)  Vice-Admiralty Courts.    5. By Section 23 of the  Supreme Court  of Judicature  (Consolidation)  Act,1925  (15 &amp;  16 Geo.  V, c. 49), which consolidated without amendment the  then existing law, the High Court (that is, the High Court in England) is declared to bea Prize Court v/ithin the meaning of the Naval Prize Acts, 1864-1916, and is givenjurisdiction  on the high seas and throughout His Majesty&apos;s dominions.   There isconsiderable difference of opinion whether this jurisdiction is permanent or  whethera commission from His Majesty is necessary before it can be exercised.  In the late war a number of commissions were in fact issued to the Court.    6. The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 (53 &amp; 54 Vic. c. 27),  Section 2,provides :-     &quot; (a) that every Court  of  Law in a British  Possession which is for the  time            being declared in pursuance of that Act to be a  Court of Admiralty,            or which, if no such declaration is  in force in the Possession, has            therein  original  unlimited civil jurisdiction, shall  be a Court  of            Admiralty  with the jurisdiction therein  mentioned and may for the            purpose of that jurisdiction exercise all the powers which it possesses            for the purpose of its civil jurisdiction.     &quot; (b) The jurisdiction of such  a Court shall, subject to the provisions of the            Act, be the same  as the Admiralty  jurisdiction of the High Court  in            England, and further, that it shall have the same regard as that Court            to international law and the  comity of nations.      &quot; (c) Any reference in  an Imperial Act to a Vice-Admiralty Court  shall            include  a  reference to  a Colonial Court of Admiralty, provided [inter            alia] that no Colonial  Court of Admiralty can by virtue of this Act,            exercise any jurisdiction under the Naval Prize Act, 1864, or otherwise            in relation to Prize.&quot;
    Section 3 empowers the Legislature of any British Possession to declare anyCourt  of unlimited  civil  jurisdiction (whether  original or  appellate) in  thatPossession to be a Colonial Court of Admiralty ;  but under Section 4 all  suchlocal Acts must, unless previously approved by a Secretary  of  State, either be reserved for His Majesty&apos;s assent or contain a suspending clause.    Section 9 gives power to  His  Majesty by commission under the Great seal to authorise the Admiralty to establish in a British Possession any Vice-AdmiraltyCourt or  Courts.  Upon the establishment of such a  Court the  Admiralty  may appoint the Judge and other officers  of the Court.   Provided that a Court estab-lished  under  this  Section shall not in  a Possession having  a representativeLegislature  exercise any jurisdiction  except  for some  purpose relating to prizeor to His Majesty&apos;s Navy, the  slave trade, or in relation to matters dealt with bythe Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vic. c. 90), or the Pacific  Islanders&apos;-Protection Acts, 1872 &amp; 1875 (35 &amp;  36 Vic. c. 19  and 38 &amp; 39 Vic. c.  51), or to matters in which questions arise relating  to treaties or conventions with foreigncountries  or  the international  law.   His  Majesty may by commission  under theGreat Seal direct  the AdmiraKy to  abolish a Vice-Admiralty Court established under the Section.    Section 10 continues  the  power  to appoint a Vice-Admiral in  any BritishPossession,  but in the  absence of  other formal appointment the  Governor  ise% officio the Vice-Admiral.    Section  17  abolishes, with certain exceptions, Vice-Admiralty  Courts  then existing.     7. The Naval Prize Act,  1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vic. c. 25), provides  as follows :-      &quot; Section 3. The High Court  of Admiralty and every Court of Admiralty            or of Vice-Admiralty or other Court exercising Admiralty jurisdiction            in  His Majesty&apos;s  dominions  for  the  time being authorised to  take            cognizance of and judicially proceed in matters of  prize shall be a            Prize Court within the meaning of the Act.      &quot; Section 4.--The High  Court  of Admiralty shall have jurisdiction through-            out His Majesty&apos;s dominions as a Prize Court with power to enforce            any order or decree of the Judicial Committee  of the. Privy Council            in a Prize Appeal.&quot;    Section 5 provides that there  shall be an appeal  to  His Majesty in council from any order or decree of a Prize Court.    Section 9 provides that every Vice-Admiralty Court  shall enforce  within itsjurisdiction all orders and decrees of the Judicial Committee and  of the HighCourt of Admiralty in prize causes.    By Section 10 His Majesty in-Council  may grant a salary to the Judge  of anyVice-Admiralty Court.   This Section was  amended by the Prize Courts Act,  1915(5 &amp; 6 Geo. V, c. 57), which, as regards Prize  Courts  in the Dominions, providedthat the  power to grant  a salary should  not in such cases be used except on theapplication of the Governor-General, or the Governor-in-Council, as the case might be.     8. The Prize Court Act, 1894 (57 &amp; 58 Vic. c. 39), provides :-       &quot; Section 1. Any commission  warrantor instructions from His Majesty or            from the Admiralty for the purpose of commissioning  or regulating the            procedure of a Prize Court at any place in a British Possession, may,            notwithstanding the existence of peace, be issued at  any time  with a            direction that the Court shall act only upon a proclamation being made            by  the Vice-Admiral on his  being satisfied  by information  from a            Secretary of State or otherwise that war has broken  out between His            Majesty and a foreign State. The commission or warrant may authorise            either a Vice-Admiralty CoUrt or a Colonial Court of Admiralty within            the meaning of the Colonial Courts of  Admiralty Act, 1890, to act as            a Prize Court,and may establish a Vice-Admiralty Court for the purpose.       &quot; Any such commission  warrant or instructions  may be revoked  or altered            from time to time.&quot;
9.  The position as regards Prize Courts in the Empire is therefore as follows :  (a) The High Court in England has jurisdiction in  prize (whether or no a      commission is necessary) throughout His Majesty&apos;s dominions ; (b) Any Court of  original unlimited civil jurisdiction in a British Possession      is a Colonial Court of Admiralty having jurisdiction in Admiralty      matters.  Colonial Courts  of Admiralty can also  be set  up by  a      Dominion or Colonial Legislature, though the Acts establishing them      must be reserved or  contain suspending clauses ; (c) The Admiralty may, if authorised by commission under the Great Seal,      set up Vice-Admiralty Courts having jurisdiction  in prize ; (d) A Colonial Court of Admiralty or Vice-Admiralty Court can only exercise      jurisdiction in prize by virtue of a commission from His Majest3r followed      by a warrant from the Admiralty, which may be  revoked at any time.      The practice is that such commission or warrant  defines the territorial      limits within which that jurisdiction is to be exercised ; (e) There is an appeal from any Prize Court  to the Privy Council and all      Prize Courts must enforce the  orders  and decrees  of  the Judicial      Committee.    10. Under the Naval Prize Court Acts, 1915 and  1916 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. V, c. 57and 6  &amp; 7 Geo. V, c. 2),  any Prize Court  in which any prize proceedings arepending may remit the proceedings in whole or in part to some other Prize Court.    11. A  Dominion Court  therefore exercises  jurisdiction in  prize  by  virtueof a Royal  Commission which, as the power of issuing such commission is a branchof the prerogative which has not been delegated to the Dominion executives, hasbeen issued on the advice of Ministers in the United Kingdom.    12. The  nature  of the law administered by  a Prize Court and  the extent towhich such a Court is bound to give effect to Acts of Parliament and to Orders inCouncil was discussed by the Privy Council in the case of the &quot; Zamora &quot; (1916,A.C. 77) when the following principles were laid down: *    The law  which a Prize Court administers is international law and the Court isnot bound  by Orders in Council purporting to prescribe or alter that law-  It is,however, bound by  the legislative  enactments of its own sovereign State, but ifan Act were  passed containing provisions  inconsistent  with  international lawthe Prize Court would, it was pointed out, in giving effect thereto no longer beadministering international law and, in the field covered by such provisions, wouldbe deprived of its proper function as a Prize Court.    It was further pointed out that it did not follow that, because Orders in council could not prescribe or alter the law to be administered by a Prize Court, a prize court would ignore Orders in Council altogether.  The Privy Council proceeded togive instances of cases in which a Prize Court would give effect, in a greater or less degree, to Orders in Council.  Orders in Council having for their object a mitigationof Crown rights in favour of the enemy or neutrals would, it is stated, be acted upon by a Prize Court.  An Order declaring a blockade would be regarded as, prima facie,justifying the capture and condemnation of vessels attempting to enter a blockadedport but would not preclude evidence to show that the blockade was ineffective andtherefore unlawful.  An Order authorising reprisals would be conclusive of the factsrecited as showing that a case for reprisals existed and would have weight as showing what, in the opinion of the executive, were the best means of meeting the emergency,but would  not preclude  the right of any party  aggrieved to contend  that  thosemeans were unlawful because entailing on neutrals a degree of inconvenience which,having regard to all the circumstances of the case, was unreasonable.  It was furtherdeclared that any Order in Council  which was acquiesced in and was not  declared by a  Prize Court to be illegal would be evidence by which,  in process  of  time, nternational  law and usage might be established.
  &apos;  13. It will be seen, therefore, that Orders in Council have a legitimate thoughlimited place in the code of law administered by a Prize Court, and that a prize court would be bound to apply any Statute dealing with that law.    14. Prize Court procedure also occupies  an  important place in the system.For example, before the Naval Prize Rules were amended shortly before the war,the evidence of ships&apos; papers alone was admissible for the purpose of condemnation,unless the Court  otherwise ordered ;  but  the amended rules made admissibleevidence of any kind from which enemy property or enemy destination, as the casemight be, could properly be inferred.  Full advantage of this change was  taken during the war.   Prize rules  of procedure are made by Order in  Council  understatutory authority.    15.  Uniformity in all these matters  has been obtained  by reason of the factthat owing to the Colonial Laws Validity Act no Dominion Legislature can pass legislation conflicting with  the Naval Prize Acts,  and the  further  fact  that dominion  Prize Courts  have  operated  under Commissions  conferred  by  theImperial executive.   Consequent^, uniform regard has been  paid to  Orders inCouncil issued by that executive by the  High  Court  in the United Kingdom andby Dominion Prize Courts.    16.  Questions concerning the distribution of the proceeds of prize are possiblyoutside the scope of  this memorandum, but  the  matter is dealt with  in certainImperial statutes  to which attention may be drawn.    17.  By Section 8 of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act,  1890, it is declaredthat nothing in that Act shall alter the application of any droits of Admiralty ordroits of  or forfeiture to the Crown  in  a  British Possession.    Such droits andforfeitures are, save as otherwise provided by any other Act, to be accounted for to the Treasury and  be dealt with in such manner as the  Treasury may direct.It is further provided that His Majesty in Council may by Order direct that subjectto any specified conditions the said droits and forfeitures condemned by a Courtin a British Possession shall form part of the  revenue of that Possession  either for ever or for such limited term as may be specified.     18.  The distinction  between  droits  of  Admiralty  (which  belong to  theExchequer) and droits of the Crown (which belong to the Crown, but under grantby the Crown may pass to the captors) originally lay in this, that, broadly speaking,droits of Admiralty were the proceeds of ships or goods seized in a British port,creek or roadstead, and droits of the Crown were the proceeds of ships or goodsseized at sea.     19.  The Naval Prize Act, 1918 (8 &amp; 9 Geo. V, c.  30), authorised His majesty o signify by proclamation His intention to make grants of prize out of the proceeds of the droits of the Crown arising during the late war and set up a tribunal todetermine whether in a particular case proceeds of a captured vessel or cargo weredroits of Admiralty or droits of the Crown.  The practice adopted by this tribunalwas such that it is no longer possible to rest the distinction between the two classesmainly on the  question whether the thing seized was  seized  in port or on the high seas.   It may be observed that under modern conditions it is frequently a difficult matter to decide  where seizure should be  regarded  as having taken place, and accordingly a  working rule  was adopted  that under the actual grant made inpursuance of the Naval Prize Act, 1918,  the Naval Prize Fund should be creditedwith  the proceeds of all seizures which could be attributed to the existence of theNaval Forces.    20.  After the late war the matter was dealt with apparently on the assumptionthat  the droits were  still at the disposal of the  Crown.  The proceeds of  droitsof the Crown  were credited to the  Naval Prize Fund and the personnel of theDominion Fleets  shared in the distribution of the Fund.   Questions as to  thedisposal of the proceeds of droits of Admiralty were the subject of discussion betweenthe Dominions and the  Imperial Government.  The arrangement ultimately madeis embodied in  a Treasury minute dated the 21st June,  1926.  Shortly, this arrange-ment gave an option to the Dominions to elect either (a) that the rights and
liabilities arising from seizure should attach to His Majesty&apos;s Government in GreatBritain or (b) that subject to certain conditions therein specified, of which one wasthat the  Dominion should assume all liabilities attaching to  the seizure, rights in respect of prizes not adjudged to the Naval  Prize Fund which were condemnedin a Dominion Prize Court should be transferred to the Dominion.    New Zealand  and Newfoundland stated that they were not concerned in thematter.  Canada and South Africa elected in favour of course (a) with, in the caseof South Africa, certain modifications.   Australia and India (which wag includedin the arrangement)  elected in favour of course  (&amp;), and Orders in Council were issued accordingly.                    (3)-The Foreign Enlistment  Act,  1870.     1. The Foreign Enlistment Act (33 &amp; 34 Vic.  c. 90) extends (Section 2)  &quot;toall the dominions of His Majesty including the adjacent territorial waters.&quot;   it provides the necessary  powers and machinery to enable  His Majesty to fulfilcertain obligations which attach to him under international law, especially in timeof war when His Majesty is neutral.  For instance, the Act prescribes penaltieson any  British subject who, without the licence of His Majesty (1) enlists  in theservice of a foreign state at war with a state with  which His Majesty is at  peace,or (2) leaves British territory intending to enlist in  such service, or (3) participatesin the transportation of illegally enlisted persons.  It also penalises the constructing,commissioning, equipping or dispatching of ships intended to be employed  in theservice of a state at war with a friendly state.     2. One section is of general application in that it is not limited to times whenHis  Majesty is  neutral.  It prescribes penalties on persons in British territoryfitting out naval or military expeditions to proceed against the  dominions of a friendly state.

(1) The Law of Nationality.     It is the object of this Chapter to indicate :        I.  The present state of Dominion legislation on  the  subject of British            nationality and naturalization with special reference to the re-enact -            ment in some instances with textual  variations of Parts I and III            of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens  Act,  1914  (4 &amp;  5            Geo. V, c. 17).      II.  The present state  of  Dominion legislation on the subject  of local            citizenship.                     NATIONALITY AND  NATURALIZATION.                              Preliminary Note.     Before 1914 the law as to the acquisition of British nationality at birth wasgoverned mainly by  (1) the common law rule by which every person born within his  Majesty&apos;s allegiance became at birth  a natural born British subject; and (2)the  British  Nationality Act, 1730 (4 Geo. II, c. 21), under which a person bornabroad became at  birth a natural born British subject if his or her father was bythe common  law a natural born British subject, and (3)  the  British nationality act, 1772 (13 Geo. Ill, c. 21), which  conferred British nationality upon the childborn abroad  of a father who was a British subject by virtue of the  Act of  1730.The  British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. V, c. 17), which came into force on 1st January, 1915,  consolidated and  amended  the law andrepealed the above-mentioned Acts.  The law relating to the acquisition of british nationality at birth now consists in the definition of  natural born  British subject as set out in Part I, Section 1, of the Act  of 1914 as amended by the Acts of 1918and  1922 :  but the definition does not, except as otherwise expressly provided inthe section, affect the status of any person born before 1st January, 1915.     Part III  of that Act contains the provisions which govern  the loss of british nationality and the national status of married women and infant children.     The Act of 1914  also repealed the Naturalization Act of  1870  under whichcertificates  of naturalization had been granted in  the United Kingdom, and inPart II made provision for the  grant of  certificates of Imperial naturalization inall parts of His Majesty&apos;s dominions subject, in the case of each of the then existingDominions, to the  adoption of Part II by the legislature of the Dominion.    The Act  of 1914 had been prepared in consultation with the Governments ofthe Dominions and was passed with their concurrence after discussion  at successiveImperial Conferences.   It was generally contemplated that Parts I and III would extend to all those  Dominions without re-enactment by the Dominion legislatures,and  would be the  only general enactment of the principles and rules governingBritish nationality. It was further contemplated that as  regards naturalization(Part II of the Act)  each Dominion would in pursuance  of the power given bySection  9 of the Act  adopt that Part by  a simple statutory enactment.  As willbe seen from  the following particulars effect has been given to the original schemeof the Act of 1914  in a way not foreseen when that scheme was approved by theImperial Conference of  1911.
                                (A) Canada.    1. The Dominion Government did not.adopt Part II of the Imperial Act inthe manner contemplated by Section 9, and did not leave Parts I and III to operateproprio vigore in the Dominion.  They preferred to re-enact,  with certain slightvariations, the whole of the Imperial Act by the Canadian Naturalization Act, 1914(4 &amp; 5 Geo. V, c. 44).  This Canadian Act was repealed by the Canadian Naturali-zation Act, 1919, but was revived in 1920 by the Naturalization Act  of that year(10 &amp; 11 Geo. V,*c. 59).   The latter Act has been followed by the Canadian Act of1923,  in which the provisions of the Imperial Amending Act of 1922 were re-enactedwithout textual variation.  In the result Parts I and III of the Imperial Act asamended are reproduced in Canada with unimportant textual variations, and it is unnecessary to  state here precisely what those variations are since they have notin &quot;fact caused, and are unlikely to cause,  any practical difficulty.    2. It is to  be noted, however, that one curious effect of the re-enactment ofPart II of the Imperial Act by the Canadian Act of 1914 is that Section 8 of thelatter Act purports to confer on the Government of the United Kingdom and theGovernment of any British  Possession a power to grant certificates of Imperialnaturalization similar to the power possessed by the Canadian  Government underthe Canadian Act.    3. The question was raised whether the re-enactment of Part II of the ImperialAct was equivalent to such an &quot; adoption &quot;  of that part as was contemplated bySection 9 of that Act.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain were, however,advised that, in view of the fact that in an amending Act passed later in 1914(5 Geo. V, c. 7) the Canadian Parliament had declared in the Preamble that by theearlier Act  the  Dominion of Canada had adopted Part II of the Imperial Act, thecourse taken by  Canada might be regarded as  an effective  adoption,  and noDominion  which  has adopted Part II subsequently has,  so far as is  known,declined to recognise as British subjects persons to whom certificates of Imperialnaturalization have been granted in Canada.    4. It may  be added that since 1914 Canada has consistently maintained theprinciple that the  provisions of its own Act relating to British nationality andnaturalization must conform with those of the Imperial Act and of any amendments of the Imperial  Act, and the Canadian Legislature has even gone so far as to repeal(on the ground that there was no such provision in the  Imperial Act) a  certainprovision giving power to naturalize married women which found its way into theCanadian Naturalization Act, 1919.    5. The present attitude of the Canadian Government with regard  to theuniformity of Imperial Nationality Law may be illustrated by a recent speech bythe Hon. Fernand  Rinfret,  Secretary of State of Canada  (Canadian CommonsDebates, No. 67, 6th April, 1927), of which the following is an extract :            &quot; The  House will appreciate the fact that the  Naturalization Act in       Canada is based upon the  Imperial Act, and that  it would not be  wise to       amend it in any way of our own accord without taking into consideration       the effects of such an amendment within the Empire.&quot;           &quot; The  existing Act in Canada is the result of what may be called a       contract  entered  into  between  Great  Britain and the Dominions at the       Imperial Conference of 1911.  I will not give the  full agreement, but will       mention  only the most important points, one being that Imperial Nationality       should be world-wide  and uniform,  and the other that the Imperial Act       should be so framed as to permit the self-governing Dominions to adopt it.&quot;&apos;                             (B)  Newfoundland.    6. Newfoundland followed the example of Canada by passing an Act in 1915 (Naturalization Act, Cap. 11 of 1915) on the same lines as the Canadian Act of  1914.His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain were,  however, advised  that, in theabsence of any legislative declaration  such as that made by Canada, there was adoubt whether  this amounted to  a formal  adoption of Part II, and accordinglya further Act was passed by Newfoundland in 1916 removing the doubt.
                                 (C) Australia.    7. Australia, by an Act passed in 1920 (The Nationality Act of 1920, No. 48 of1920), re-enacted Parts I and III  of the Imperial Act without any variations,  andre-enacted and formally adopted Part II with certain variations.  These variationshave not so far given rise to difficulty.                               (D) New Zealand.    8.  The position in New Zealand in recent years has been that New zealand had not adopted Part II of the Imperial Act and that, as a result of this fact, -andof the provisions of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens (in New Zealand)Act, 1923, a person who has been naturalised in  New Zealand is legally an  alienoutside the limits of the Dominion, and a person to whom a certificate of Imperialnaturalisation has been granted elsewhere has hitherto been, by New Zealand law(Section 3 (3)), an alien unless and until he has obtained a New Zealand certificate.    9.  In July, 1928, a British Nationality and Status of Aliens (in New Zealand)Bill was introduced into the New Zealand Parliament.   This Bill provides (Section 3)for the adoption of Part II of the Imperial Act, which is  set out in full in the  first schedule to the  Bill and contains a declaratory statement (Section 6), with regardto the provisions of Parts I and III of the Imperial Act, which are set out in theSecond Schedule to the Bill.    The Bill has passed both Houses of Parliament and is reserved for His Majesty&apos;assent.                               (is) South Africa.    10.  In July,. 1926, South Africa passed the British Nationality in the union and Status of iVIiens Act, re-enacting Parts I, II, and III of the Imperial Act, withimportant additions and variations.   The most important of these differences areas follows :        (a) Under Section 3 of the Union Act a holder of a certificate of local natural-            ization granted  before  1st  July,  1926, is entitled as of right to a            certificate of Imperial  naturalization,  and such a person may  not            fulfil any of the qualifications of residence or character laid down in            the Imperial Act.  It may be questioned whether in law a certificate            granted under this  provision has any effect outside the  Union if  the            grantee does not in  fact  possess  the qualifications required by Part II            as repeated in the Union Act.   A case has already come under notice            in which a person of this class who had been refused  a certificate in            this country has after  a short visit to  South Africa  returned here            with  a certificate of Imperial naturalization granted  there.  But as            there is in the Minister a discretion in certain circumstances to deprive            the holder  of the local certificate of that certificate, the difference            between the two systems may not be so great as it appears at first sight.       (b) Section 4 (1)  (6) authorises the grant of special certificates of  Imperial            naturalization  to persons domiciled in the Union for the five years            immediately preceding the commencement of the Act on the basis            of their service in the British or Republican Forces during the Boer War.       (c) Section 29  confers British nationality upon  any person  of European            descent born in  the South African Republic between the 18th June,            1894, and the  1st  September,  1900 (the date  of  annexation), whose            father was neither a burgher of that Republic nor a British subject.                         (F) Irish Free State.11.  The Irish Free State has not as yet passed any  legislation on this subject.
                           DOMINION CITIZENSHIP.    The  only Dominions in which  legislation is  in  force for the definition of citizenship are Canada, South Africa, and the Irish Free State.              -   .-                                (A) Canada.    1. There are two Canadian enactments to  consider, viz.,  the  CanadianImmigration Act, 1910 (as amended by numerous subsequent enactments), whichdefines the expression &quot; Canadian citizen &quot; for the purpose of immigration ;  andthe Act of 1921 for the definition of &quot; Canadian nationals.&quot;    2. By the former Act &quot; Canadian citizen &quot; means :        (i) A person born in Canada who has not become an alien ;      (ii) A British subject who has Canadian domicile ; or     (iii) A person naturalized under the laws of Canada who has not subsequently         -  become an alien or lost Canadian domicile.    A Canadian citizen for this purpose must, therefore, be a British subject  whopossesses British nationality everywhere,  or a person who by local naturalizationin Canada is a British subject within the limits of Canada. Domicile and the periodof time necessary to acquire a domicile are specially defined by the Canadian  Act,and the expression itself has not the same meaning as in English law.    3. It was intended by the Canadian  Government that  the Act of  1921 should provide a, clear-cut definition of Canadian nationals for the purpose in particular of identifying those persons who would be affected by the extra-territorial legislation which, in 1921,  it was anticipated would be authorised by the then proposed amendment of the British North America Act.  By this Act the following persons are Canadian nationals :        (a) Any British subject who is  a Canadian citizen within the  meaning of           the Immigration Act, 1910, as amended up to 1921 ;       (b) The wife of any such citizen ;       (c) Any person born out of Canada whose father was a Canadian national           at the time of that  person&apos;s  birth ;  or with regard to persons born           before the passing of the Act,  any person whose father at the time           of such birth possessed all the qualifications of a Canadian national           as defined by the Act.    This definition evidently contemplates that the Canadian national shall in allcases  be a person who possesses in Canada the status of a British subject.    4. Section 2 of the  Act of  1921  provides that a  person who is  a  Canadiannational shall cease to be a Canadian national on making a  declaration renouncingCanadian nationality  if he has  become  a  national also of the United Kingdom,or of any  self-governing Dominion.   This  section  pre-supposes that  provision is made or will be made in the law of the United Kingdom and of the Dominions forthe purpose of determining who are the nationals  of those parts of the Empire.                             (B) South Africa.    5. The Union of South Africa Nationality and Flags Act, 1927, contains provi-sions for the definition of South African nationals similar to those in the CanadianAct of 1921 for the definition of Canadian nationals.    6. On the question whether South African nationals must be British subjects,it may be of interest to quote  the following extract from the speech of the Ministerof the Interior  (Dr. Malan) on the  Second Reading  of this Bill in  the House of assembly on 24th May, 1927.           &quot; The Bill  made it  quite clear that every South African national  was       and  must be a British subject.  South African nationality was merely a       small circle within a larger one.&quot;
                           (C) Irish Free State.    7. Local citizenship in the Irish Free State is governed by Article 3 of theIrish Free State Constitution.   This Article       (a) defined Irish Free State citizenship, at the time when the Constitution            came into force, in such a way as to  include persons who were not            necessarily British subjects, and      (b) confers  power  to  determine  the conditions governing  the  future            acquisition and termination  of  Free  State  citizenship.  This power            has not been exercised.                    (2) Nationality of Married Women.     1. At the last Imperial Conference the Nationality Committee, over whichthe Home Secretary presided, considered a number of proposed amendments ofthe British Nationality and  Status of Aliens Act, 1914 (4 &amp; 5, Geo. V, c. 17).  Themost important of these  was a proposal relating to the nationality of marriedwomen.  This proposal was to the effect that the existing principle of the law asenacted in Section 10 of the Act of 1914 (that the national status of a wife should follow that of her husband) should be abandoned, so far at any rate as that principleaffects the status of a British woman who married an alien.     2. The specific proposal before  the Nationality  Committee was based on aResolution passed unanimously in the House of Commons on the 18th of February.1925, as follows :            &quot; That in the  opinion of  this  House a British woman should not lose       or be deemed to lose her nationality by the mere  act of marriage with  an       alien but that it should be open to her to make a declaration of alienage.&quot;   .  A Resolution in similar terms was passed by the House of Representatives inAustralia  on the 25th of February, 1926.     3. In the course of discussion of this proposal at meetings of the NationalityCommittee serious differences of opinion were disclosed.   Some of the dominions were in favour of  the  proposed  change, while others were against any alterationof the law on the ground  that it would  be unsuitable to their own conditions and requirements,  and that socially  and politically there was no need or demand for it.   The Government in Great Britain itself had not adopted any  considered policy on the question, and the  Nationality Committee reported to the following effect,as recorded in the  Summary of Proceedings, Cmd. 2768, p. 39 :            &quot; On this  matter some  divergence of view was  disclosed  and the       Committee  were unable  to  arrive  at  a  unanimous conclusion.  Since       however, they attach great importance to the maintenance of uniformity       throughout  the  various parts  of  the Empire in the law -relating to British       nationality  they decided to  recommend  to the Conference that  further       consideration of the question should be postponed  pending the  Report       of the Committee of  Experts   .   .  .  and in view of the possibility of an       attempt being made to regulate the problems  of  dual nationality and  no       nationality by international agreement.&quot;(3) Disabilities to which a British Woman becomes subject in the United Kingdom                          on Marriage with an Alien.                          Franchise and Public Offices.    1. Under  the  Representation of the People Act, 1918 (7 &amp; 8 Geo. V, c. 64),Section 9  (3), a  person  is  not  entitled  to be registered  or to  vote as  a parliamentary or  local government elector if he  is  not  a British subject.    A woman who has ceased to be a British subject  by reason of marriage withan alien is therefore disqualified for the franchise.
    As an alien such a woman is. of course ineligible for election as a member ofParliament.  By Section 46 (1)  of  the  Local Government  Act,  1894  (56  &amp;  57Vic. c.  73), aliens  are  disqualified also from being  members of  metropolitan borough Councils, Urban and  Rural District Councils, and  Boards of Guardians.                                 Civil Service.    2. By Section  6 of the Aliens  Restriction (Amendment) Act,  1919 (9 &amp; 10Geo. V, c. 92), it is provided that after the passing of that  Act no alien shall beappointed to any office or place in the Civil Service of the State.  Apart from this general prohibition in the case of aliens, any British woman who marries is as a rule required to resign her appointment in the Civil Service, and  accordingly ifa British  woman  married to  an alien were excepted  from  the  scope  of thegeneral prohibition in  Section 6 of the Act of 1919,  it  would be of little  or noassistance  to  her so  long  as  it  is the general  policy  not to employ marriedwomen  in established situations.                              Old Age Pensions.    3. Under the Old Age Pensions  Acts, 1908 to  1924, a claimant for a pensionwhose claim is not within the scope of Section 20 of the Widows, Orphans and old age Contributory  Pensions Act,  1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. V, c.  70), must satisfy the pension Authorities that for at least  ten years up to the date of  the receipt ofany sum on account of  a pension, he has been a  British subject.  This conditionis, however, not required to  be fulfilled in the  case of a  woman  who satisfiesthe Pension Authorities that she would, but  for her marriage with an  alien,  havefulfilled this condition.    A British woman who marries an  alien is therefore eligible for  an old age pension.Aliens Restriction Acts, 1914 and 1919 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. V, c. 12, and 9 &amp; 10 Geo V,c. 92),                            and Aliens Order, 1920.    4. A  British woman who  becomes an alien  by marriage is  subject  to therestrictions imposed by the Aliens Order on aliens.   She is  thus prohibited fromlanding in the United  Kingdom without the leave of an Immigration Officer, and she is required to register as an alien  if  resident in the United Kingdom.  She isalso liable to be  deported as an alien.    By Article 14 of the Aliens  Order the  Secretary of  State may exempt fromall  or any of the provisions of the  Order, any person or class of persons, eitherconditionally or unconditionally, or subject to conditions.    It may be possible for the Secretary of State to exercise this power in favour ofwomen  who are  aliens by marriage.   So far as concerns liability to  register as an alien, this would appear to be quite practicable, and exemption is in fact grantedfrom time to time in such cases  where there  are  special circumstances.  Generalexemption from the obligation to obtain leave to land in the United Kingdom rests on a somewhat different footing.  It is only in very exceptional circumstances thatleave to land is refused in the case of the British-born wife of an alien.    By Section  7 of the Aliens Restriction Act, 1919,  an alien is not allowed toassume or use any name other than that by which  he was ordinarily known on the4th August, 1914.  Any exception in  favour  of British women married to alienswould require an amendment of the section.        Registration of Business Names Act, 1916 (6 &amp; 7 Geo. V, c. 58).    5. In Section 18 of this Act the nationality if  not British, in  addition to thename, of a person carrying on business is in certain circumstances required to be stated on all business letters and  documents. *This provision extends to a womanwho has become an alien by marriage  and an exemption would require legislation.
     (4) Pension and Franchise Rights in the Dominions of a British Woman                             Marrying an Alien.                                 AUSTRALIA.    1. The wife of an alien is deemed to be an alien (Act 48 of 1920, Section 18).Old Age Pensions :     Under the invalid and old age pensions legislation of the Commonwealth certainclasses of persons including aliens are not qualified to receive either of such pensions,but it is expressly laid down that no woman having married any person so disquali-fied shall in consequence only of such marriage be disqualified to receive such pensions.A British woman marrying an alien would therefore not be disqualified.  (Invalidand Old Age Pensions Act, 1908-1926, Sections 16 and 21.)Mothers&apos; Allowances  :     Both New South Wales and Victoria provide for payments in certain circum-stances to  mothers in  support of dependent  children.  There is nothing to showthat any discrimination is made against a  person who is an alien.Parliamentary Franchise :     In the Commonwealth the franchise is limited to natural-born or naturalizedsubjects of either sex (Act 27 of 1918,  Section 39).    This is also the case in respect of all the States.  A British woman in Australiamarrying an  alien would therefore forfeit her right  to the franchise.                                   CANADA.    2. The wife of an alien is deemed to be an alien (Act 44 of 1914, Section  10).Old Age Pensions :     No old age pensions.  In  Canada, the movement, which in the United Kingdomand other Dominions resulted in the granting of old age pensions, took the form ofproviding  Government annuities purchasable by any person, over the age of fiveyears,  domiciled or resident in the Dominion.Mothers&apos; Allowances  or Pensions :     In certain of the Canadian Provinces, viz., Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba,Ontario, and Saskatchewan, mothers&apos; allowances or pensions  are granted to  wivesor widows in support of  dependent children.   Such allowance or pension is, in thecase of Ontario, payable to a woman who was a British subject by birth or naturali-zation (10 &amp;  11 Geo. V, c. 89, Section 3 (e)), but in British Columbia no mother is entitled to such allowance or pension unless she  is a British subject  (Cap. 176Revised Statutes, 1924, Section 4(a)).   There is  nothing in  the correspondinglegislation of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to suggest that such allowance would be refused to a woman if she were an alien.Parliamentary Franchise :     The Dominion franchise is limited to British subjects, male or female (10 &amp;  11Geo. V, c. 46, Section 29).    Throughout the Provinces the franchise is limited to British subj ects* of  eithersex with the exception of Quebec, where apparently males only are entitled to vote.A British woman marrying  an alien would therefore possess no  right to  either the Dominion or any Provincial franchise.                             IRISH FREE STATE.Old Age Pensions :     3. The Imperial Old Age Pensions Acts,  1908-1919, as amended by  Irish FreeState Act 19 of 1924, are in force in the Irish Free State.  Under these Acts a womanmarrying an  alien is eligible for pension.    * In British Columbia a person is entitled to vote if, inter alia, he is &quot; entitled within the Provinceto the privileges of a natural-born British subject.&quot;
Parliamentary Franchise :     All citizens of the Irish Free State without distinction of sex are eligible forthe franchise (Irish Free State Constitution, Article 14).    Article 3  of the Constitution,, while defining the conditions of  citizenship atthe time of the coming into operation of the Constitution, states that the conditions governing the  future acquisition and termination of citizenship shall be determinedby law.  No such legislation has yet been passed.                               NEWFOUNDLAND.    4. The wife of an alien is deemed to be.an alien (Cap. 78 Consolidated Statutes,1916, Section 10).Old Age Pensions :                  ...    The conditions laid down in Section 2 of the Newfoundland Old Age pensions act  (Cap.  74 Consolidated Statutes,  1916) make  no  reference to nationality.Presumably  therefore  a  British  woman  married  to  an alien would not be disqualified thereby.Parliamentary Franchise :     The franchise is hmited to British subjects (Cap.  3 Consolidated Statutes, 1916,Section 4 as substituted by 15 Geo. V, cap. 7, Section 2).  A British woman marryingan alien would therefore be disqualified.                               NEW ZEALAND.    5. The wife of an  alien is  deemed to be an alien (Imperial Act, 1914-1922,Section 10, scheduled to New Zealand Act 46 of 1923).Old Age, etc., Pensions :     The Pensions Act, 1926 (No. 56 of 1926) provides, inter alia, for old age pensions, -widows&apos; pensions, and pensions for the blind.  The Act does not apply to aliens(Section 91 (1) (b)), and the only circumstances in which a British woman havingmarried an alien would be entitled to these pensions are if her husband is deceased,or if she is legally separated from him (see Section 91 (3) ).Parliamentary Franchise :     An alien  is not  entitled  to have  his name  registered on the electoral roll(No. 101 Consolidated Statutes, 1908, Section 38 ;  see also the New Zealand OfficialYear Book, 1927, page 56).                          UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.    6. The wife of an alien in the Union is deemed to be an alien (Act 18 of 1926,Section 12).Old Age Pensions :     No legislation on the subject.Parliamentary Franchise :     Women, whether British or alien, have no rights (i.e., throughout the Union,the franchise  is confined to male  adults) vide Official Year Book, 1910-1925,page 116, paragraph 8 (1) (1).(C 14432)
THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE.                        Appeals to  the King in Council.     1. Appeals  from courts  in  the  Dominions  come before the King in Council (i.e., before the  Judicial Committee) in one of three ways :        (i) As of right in pursuance of Statute or Order in Council;      (ii) By leave granted by the court from which the appeal is made, also in            pursuance of Statute or Order in Council;     (iii) By special leave granted under the Royal Prerogative by  the King in            Council.    2. The Constitutions of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Union of SouthAfrica, and the  Irish Free State contain the  following provisions  with regard toappeals to  the King in Council:    Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia (Schedule to the Commonwealth      of Australia Constitution Act of 1900 (63 &amp; 64 Vic. c. 12)), Section 74.           &quot; No appeal shall  be permitted to the Queen in Council  from a decision      of the High Court upon any  question,  howsoever arising, as to the limits      inter se of the  Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any      State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of any      two  or more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the question is      one which ought to be  determined by Her Majesty in Council.           &quot; The High Court may  so certify if satisfied that for  any special      reason the certificate should be granted and thereupon an  appeal shall lie      to Her Majesty in Council on the question without further leave.           &quot; Except  as provided in this section, this Constitution shall not impair      any  right which the Queen may be pleased to exercise by virtue of Her      Royal Prerogative to grant special leave of appeal from the High Court to      Her Majesty in Council. The Parliament may make laws limiting the matters      in which such leave may be asked,  but  proposed laws containing any such      limitation shall be reserved by the Governor-General for  Her Majesty&apos;s      pleasure.&quot;             South Africa Act, 1909 (9 Edw. VII, c. 9), Section 106.           &quot; There shall be no appeal from the Supreme Court of South Africa or      from any division thereof to the King in  Council, but nothing  herein con-      tained shall be construed to impair any right which the King  in Council may      be pleased to exercise to grant special leave to  appeal from the Appellate      Division to the  King in Council. Parliament may make laws limiting the      matters in respect of which such special leave may be asked, but Bills con-      taining any such limitation shall be reserved by the  Governor-General  for      the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure ; provided  that nothing in this      section shall affect any right of appeal to His Majesty in Council from any      judgment given  by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court under or in      virtue of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890.&quot;
 Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922 (Session 2) (13 Geo. V, Sess. 2, c. 1) Schedule,                                  Article 66.           &quot; The Supreme Court of the Irish Free State shall, with such exceptions       (not including cases which involve questions as to the validity of any law)       and subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by law, have appellate       jurisdiction from all decisions of  the High Court.   The decision of the       Supreme Court  shall in all Cases be final and conclusive, and shall not be       reviewed or capable of being  reviewed  by  any  other  Court, Tribunal or       Authority whatsoever.      i           &quot; Provided that nothing in this Constitution shall impair the right of       any person to petition His Majesty for  special  leave to appeal  from the       Supreme Court  to His Majesty in Council or the right of His Majesty to       grant such leave.&quot;     3. There are no similar constitutional provisions in the cases of the dominions of Canada and  New Zealand, but the Dominion of Canada has made the  followingprovision in Section 59 of Chapter 139 of the Revised Statutes of Canada :            &quot; The judgment of the  (Supreme) Court shall, in  all cases, be final and       conclusive, and no appeal shall be brought from  any  judgment or order of       the Court to any Court of Appeal established by the Parliament of Great       Britain and Ireland by which appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council       may be  ordered to be heard, saving any right which His Majesty may be       graciously.pleased to exercise by virtue of his royal prerogative.&quot;     4. It will be seen from the  above survey that the present position as regardsthe right of the King in Council to give special leave to appeal  is (1) that the rightnow exists as regards all the Dominions and their constituent  Provinces  or States (except in the  case of the Commonwealth of Australia in respect of the limitedclass of Constitutional  appeals above referred  to) ; (2) that  the Parliaments ofAustralia and South Africa have power to pass laws limiting the matters  in respectof which  such leave may be asked, but that no such laws have in fact been passed,and any  such  law must be reserved for  His Majesty&apos;s pleasure, but (3) that the parliaments of  Canada,  New Zealand,  and the Irish Free State have no such power.     5. It appears expedient to  add a short note with regard  to the appeal as of right.  This has, in general terms, been abolished in the case of the High Court ofAustralia (Section 73 of the constitution), the  Supreme Court of South Africa (ubi supra), and the Supreme Court of the Irish  Free State (ubi supra) by ImperialStatute, and in the case of the Supreme Court of Canada (ubi supra) by dominion legislation.  The right  still remains in New Zealand,  and also in Newfoundland,and is regulated in the case of the former by Order in  Council made under theJudicial Committee Act, 1844 (7 &amp; 8  Vic. c. 69), and in the case of the latter byOrder in Council made under the Newfoundland Act,  1824 (5 Geo.  IV,  c.  67),(providing  for  the  administration of justice in  that Colony).   The  right  alsoremains in the case of the Canadian Provinces and of the Australian States.     6. There is also an appeal as of right from Indian courts ; it is regulated by anOrder in  Council of 9th February, 1920  (under the  Judicial  Committee Act, 1833(3 &amp; 4, Will. IV, c. 41)), by clauses in the letters patent which govern the severalHigh Courts in  India, and by Sections 109 and 112 of the Code, of Civil Procedure.     7. There are certain matters, however, with regard  to which the appeal as of right cannot be abolished by Dominion  legislation  so long as the Colonial LawsValidity Act, 1865, continues in its present application to the Dominions.  Theseare Admiralty Appeals under Section  6 of the Colonial  Courts of Admirahy Act,1890 (53  &amp; 54 Vic. c. 27), and Prize Appeals under Section  5  of the  Naval PrizeAct, 1864 (27&apos;&amp; 28 Vic. c. 25).  Admiralty Appeals to the  Privy Council areexpressly saved by the South Africa Act,  1909, but the provisions of the Common-wealth of Australia and the Irish Free State Constitutions are silent on the subject.
                      THE  OFFICIAL  SECRETS  ACTS.                The Official Secrets Act,  1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vic. c. 52).    1. This Act applied to all acts made; offences by  the Act when committed in any part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions, or when committed by British officers orsubjects elsewhere (Section 6 (1) ).   Section 5 provided for the suspension by Orderin Council of this Act in any British Possession the Legislature of which had madeequivalent  provision, and &quot; British possession   was defined as any part of HisMajesty&apos;s dominions not within the United Kingdom.    The  Act  was accordingly suspended in Jersey (1890)  and in the Isle of Man(1890).              The  Official Secrets Act, 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. V, c. 28).    2. This Act repealed the Act  of 1889 but re-enacted in Section  10  (1) theprovisions  of Section 6  (1), and in  Section 11 the provisions of Section 5, of theearlier Act.    Under Section  11 the Act has been suspended in Malta (1914), the Common-wealth of Australia (1915), and India (1923).             The Official Secrets Act, 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. V, c. 75).    3. This Act  supplements and  amends the  Act of 1911 (referred to as theprincipal Act) and provides (Section 11 (1) ) that it shall be construed as one withthe principal Act  and that the two Acts may be  cited together  as the official secrets Acts, 1911  and 1920.    By proviso (a) to Section 11 (1), the Dominions and India are expressly excludedfrom its operation, but it applies to all the rest of His Majesty&apos;s dominions, and itmay be mentioned that, on Malta having passed legislation equivalent to the act of 1920,  the Order in Council of 1914 suspending the  Act of 1911 in Malta wasreplaced by an Order in Council in 1923 suspending both Acts in that Island.    It would not appear that either the Act of 1911 or the Act of  1920 has been suspended in Jersey  or the Isle of Man.    The Act was passed on the 23rd December, 1920, and copies were sent out tothe Dominions on the 15th  January, 1921.  The Dominions generally have not passed similar  legislation up to the present time ;  but the Irish  Free  State hasrecently issued an Order under the (Free State)  Adaptation of Enactments Act,1922, with the object of adapting the Acts  of 1911  and  1920 for Free Statepurposes only.
(1) THE  FUGITIVE OFFENDERS ACT,  1881.(2) THE  EXTRADITION  ACTS,  1870 TO 1908.(3) THE  COLONIAL  PRISONERS REMOVAL  ACTS,  1869 AND 1884.                   (1)-The Fugitive  Offenders Act, 1881.     1. The Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881 (44 &amp; 45 Vic. c. 69), applies  throughoutHis Majesty&apos;s dominions.   Part I of the Act provides machinery for securing that aperson accused of having committed certain offences in one part of these dominionscan be arrested and returned to that part if found in some other part.   The procedureprovided for this  purpose bears  a general  resemblance  to  extradition,  but  it is naturally of a simpler and less formal character, since there, is no question, as inthe case, of extradition, of the Government of any part dealing with foreign States.    The offences&apos;to  which Part I of  the Act applies are treason and  piracy and every offence for the time being punishable, in the part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions in which it was committed, by not less than twelve months&apos; imprisonment withhard labour, or any greater punishment.    2. The first step in the procedure, under Part I of the Act, is the issue in theplace where the offence was committed of a warrant for the  arrest of the offender.The  arrest may be effected either Under the authority of am endorsement of thiswarrant by the proper authority  in the place to which the  fugitive goes or,&apos; as ismore usually  the case, under authority of a  provisional  warrant issued by  amagistrate in that place.  The  application for a  provisional warrant  must be supported  by such information as would justify the issue of a warrant, if  the offence of  which the fugitive is accused had been committed in the jurisdiction ofthe magistrate to whom the application is made (Section 4).    3. The essential requirements of the system established by Part I are : (a) thata  fugitive  cannot be sent back  to  the place whose authorities have  applied for his return until  the  original  warrant has arrived (Section 5) ;  (b)  that  theevidence produced to the magistrate  shall,  according  to the  law ordinarilyadministered by him, be  such as to raise a strong  or probable presumption thatthe fugitive committed the offence mentioned in the warrant (Section 5) &quot;;  (c) thatthe fugitive shall only be returned under the authority of a warrant under the hand of a Secretary of  State in the United Kingdom or the Governor of  the  Possession,as the case may be.    The Act provides certain safeguards so as to  ensure,  e.g., that the fugitiveshall not be returned until he has had the opportunity of applying for a writ ofhabeas corpus.    4. The procedure  laid down by this Act has hitherto  necessarily beendependent  upon an Act of the Imperial Parliament  giving  extra-territorial effectthroughout all  the  dominions  and  on  British  ships  on  the  high  seas towarrants of return issued in any part.   Thus, by Section  6 of the  Act of 1881, a warrant of return  signed by the.  Secretary of State  or the  Governor of a BritishPossession  authorises the conveyance of the offender by  sea or  otherwise  inlegal custody to the part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions  from which he is  a  fugitive.Section 27 of the. Act provides that  the fugitive  may  be  sent  &quot; in  any shipbelonging to Her Majesty  or to any of Her subjects &quot; and empowers the authority
sosigning the warrant to require the master of the ship to receive the fugitive andon the ship&apos;s arrival in the part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions to which he is being returned to give him into custody  of  some constable there to be dealt  withaccording to law.    5. The Act contains no provision corresponding to the provision in Section 18of the Extradition Act, 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vic. c. 52), which provides for the completesuspension of the Imperial legislation in the case of a British Possession which has passed comprehensive legislation of its own.  Section 32 of the Act of 1881 makes provision for recognising and giving effect by Order in Council to local legislation relating to certain specified matters ; and When such an Order has been made thelocal law, subject to any  modification or alterations specified in the Order, haseffect throughout His Majesty&apos;s dominions and on the high seas as if it were partof the Act of 1881.  The  matters specified include  the  definition of offences com-mitted in the Possession to which the Act of 1881  is to apply, the determination of certain matters of procedure and costs and generally anything which is necessary or proper for the carrying of the Act into effect in the Possession.    6. In Part II of  the Act of 1881  (Sections 12 to 19) there are provisions relating to the  inter-colonial backing of warrants so as to facilitate, without the intervention of the Governor,  the transfer of accused persons as between british possesions which are grouped together for this  purpose under the Act by reasonof their contiguity.   This scheme applies only  to groups of British Possessionswhich are so constituted by Order in Council.    In the case of Australia an  Order was made under the Act  in  1925 for thepurpose of grouping together the different Australasian territories.                   (2)-The  Extradition  Acts, 1870  to  1906.    1. The Acts of the Imperial Parliament relating to  extradition are :            The Extradition Act, 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vic. c. 52) ;           The Extradition Act, 1870 (Amendment) Act, 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vic. c. 60) ;           The Extradition Act, 1895 (58 &amp; 59 Vic. c. 33) ;           The Extradition Act, 1906 (6 Ed. VII. c. 15).    2. The Imperial Acts  authorise the carrying out of arrangements made withforeign States for the surrender of criminals who are fugitive from those Statesand are charged with having  committed an extradition crime.  To bring the Actsinto operation in relation to any foreign State it is necessary that there should be(1) an extradition treaty with that State ;  and (2) an  Order in. Council made inGreat Britain applying the Acts in the  case  of  that  State,  subject  to  such&quot; conditions,  exceptions  and  qualifications as  may   be  deemed expedient &quot;(Section 2 of the Act of 1870).   When the Acts are so applied in the case of any foreign  State, every fugitive criminal of that State who &quot; is in or suspected ofbeing in any part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions  (or that part which is specified inthe Order in Council applying the  Acts,  as the case  may be)  is liable to  beapprehended and surrendered &quot; as provided by the Acts whether there is or is notany concurrent jurisdiction in any court of His Majesty&apos;s dominions over the crimein respect of which the surrender is  sought (Section 6  of the Act&apos;of 1870).    The term &quot; Extradition  crime  &quot; is defined as  meaning a  crime  which,  ifcommitted in England or within  English jurisdiction  or  if committed in any british Possession to which the Act is extended, would  be one of the  crimesdescribed  in the first schedule to the Act of 1870.    The term  &quot;Fugitive criminal &quot; means  any person accused or convicted  ofan extradition crime committed within the jurisdiction of any foreign State whois in or is suspected of being in some part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions.
         3.  The Acts  when  applied  by  Order in Council extend, unless otherwise     provided  in the Order,  to  every British  Possession in the same manner as if,     throughout the Acts, the British  Possession were substituted for United Kingdom     or England as the case may require (Section 17 of the Act of 1870).  The Governor     of a British Possession has all the powers and  duties of the Secretary  of State     and of a police magistrate in relation to the surrender of a fugitive criminal;.  andIP   the warrant for surrender is issued by him subject to the right on the part of the     person charged to challenge the  legality of the surrender in the same way as in     the United Kingdom.         4.  (a) The Extradition Acts thus apply  generally throughout His Majesty&apos;s     dominions ; but provision is made in Section 18 of the Act of 1870 for the suspension     of the operation of the Acts in any part  of the dominions by Order in Council if,     in that part, there is  a law or ordinance of the local Legislature in force for carrying     into effect the surrender  of fugitive criminals and so long as such law or ordinance     continues in force, and  no  longer.   A  &quot;suspending&quot; Order  in Council  is only     made if the part of  the dominions in  question  has passed  a   comprehensive     Extradition Act  for  itself.   Only in the  case  of Canada has the Act been so sus-     pended,  Canada having  enacted many  years ago  a comprehensive Extradition     Law  of  its own (Canadian Revised Statutes,  1906, c.  155)  consolidating and     amending previous Acts  of 1877  (C. 25)  1882 (C. 20) and  1886 (C. 142).         (b)  Section 18 of the Act  of  1870 also provides, alternatively,  that an Order     in Council may be made directing that any local law or ordinance  relating to the     surrender of fugitive criminals in a British Possession shall have effect in that     Possession as if the  local law  were part  of the Act of 1870.   The intention and     effect of this is to enable a Possession to regulate by local enactment matters of     domestic  machinery  and procedure according to its own requirements.   Such     enactments have been passed in  some of the Dominions  and Colonies and effect     has been given to them by Orders in Council, with the result that the local procedure  .   becomes (locally)  part of the scheme  of extradition under  the  Act of 1870.     Extradition procedure in Australia, for example, is regulated by a  Commonwealth     Act  to which  effect  has  been given by  an Order in Council under this part of     Section  18.  (Extradition Act, 1903, of the Commonwealth.)         It is to be observed that  &quot; legislature  of  a British possession &quot; in Section 18     of the Act of 1870 means the Central Legislature of the Possession.   In a Dominion,     therefore, a Provincial or State  Legislature  cannot legislate  on  the subject of     extradition as contemplated by the Act of 1870.         It is  also to be observed that neither of the  alternative powers given by     Section  18 is confined to self-governing  Dominions.   Both extend to all  British     Possessions, but no  Colony  has acted on the former  alternative  (comprehensive     legislation).         In a draft Bill prepared during the war, and submitted to and agreed by all     the Dominions then existing,  it was  proposed, inter  alia,  that the  Imperial Act     should be suspended  only in the case of legislation by a Dominion.   A copy of the     Bill  is annexed.    5. The Act of 1870 appears to contemplate only general extradition treatieswhich apply or may be applied to the whole Empire.  Such treati es have in thepast been negotiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and up to a recent date (1924) this was done without previous consultation with the dominions or India.  In recently concluded treaties, however, it is provided that the treaty shall not apply to any of the Dominions or India unless notice of accession is given and that it may be separately terminated in respect of any Dominion or India.The corresponding Orders in Council applying the Act of 1870 in the case of theforeign  States with whom these treaties  have been  made  contain  a provisionsuspending the operation of the Act within each of the Dominions (except Canada)and India until accession has  been notified.   Six extradition treaties containingthis provision have been  negotiated since 1924 and  to these all the Dominionshave acceded.
     It may be pointed out that Canada has entered into two independent obliga-tions  with  the United States by separate treaties concluded in  1922 and 1925.These treaties are expressed to be supplementary to,  and an integral  part of theextradition treaties in  force between,  the United States and Great Britain.     6.  With regard  to the operation  of surrender warrants, the  present positionis that a surrender warrant issued under the Act of 1870 is valid  throughout HisMajesty&apos;s dominions  (save possibly in  Canada, which has its own  ExtraditionAct), but a surrender  warrant issued in Canada is invalid out  of Canada.   If aperson  who is extradited from Canada  passes through  England en route, e.g., toGermany, it becomes necessary, in the event of the offender disputing the legality of his custody,  to begin extradition proceedings against him in England de novo.*In  other words, while in custody under a Canadian warrant only, he cannot be saidto be in legal custody in England.     7.   It was contemplated that the difficulty mentioned  in the last paragraphmight be met by an amendment of the Act on the lines proposed in Clause 2 (1)  (b)of the Bill,  copy of which is annexed.APPENDIX.                 DRAFT  OF A BILL TO  AMEND THE  LAW  RELATING TO  EXTRADITION                                        AND FUGITIVE OFFENDERS.               Be it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the           Lords Spiritual and;e Temporal, and Commons, in  this present Parliament assembled, and by the           authority of the same, as follows :                                              Part I.

It shall be lawful for the legislature of any  part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions outside the           United Kingdom by law or ordinance to add to the list of extradition crimes mentioned in the First           Schedule to the Extradition Act, 1870, such crimes as may be specified in such law or ordinance, and           where such a law or ordinance has been passed the Extradition Acts, 1870 to 1906, as extended to that           part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions by Order in Council, whether made before or after the passing of this           Act, shall as respects that part have effect as if the crimes so added were included in the said list.Extradition      2. (1) If by any law or ordinance made either  before or after the passing of this Act by thelegislation  of legislature of  any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions outside the United Kingdom provision is madeBritish      for carrying into effect within such part the surrender of fugitive criminals who are in or suspectedpossessions.  of ^ejng m suc^ part; This Majesty may by the Order in Council applying the Extradition Acts, 1870           to 1906, in the case of  any foreign state, or by any subsequent Order                  (a) direct that such law or ordinance or any part thereof shall have effect in such part of His                     Majesty&apos;s Dominions with or without modifications and alterations  as if it were part of                     those Acts ; or                 (&amp;) if such law or ordinance has  been made by  the legislature of any of the  self-governing                     Dominions suspend  the operation within that Dominion of those Acts or any part thereof                     so far as they relate to such foreign state,  and so long as such law or ordinance continues                     in force there, and direct that such law or ordinance shall, with or without modification,                     be recognised and given effect to throughout His Majesty&apos;s  Dominions and on the high                     seas, in substitution, as respects the Dominion in question, for the Extradition Acts, 1870                     to 1906, or such part thereof as aforesaid.               (2) In this section the expression &quot; self-governing Dominion &quot;  means the Dominion of Canada,           the  Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and           Newfoundland.               (3) Section eighteen of the  Extradition Act, 1870, is hereby repealed, but nothing in this repeal           shall affect the provisions of any Order in Council having effect under the said section eighteen, and           any such&apos;provisions shall continue in force and may be revoked, altered, or amended as if made under           this section.    * Police conducting such a person across England are in practice furnished with a provisionalwarrant of arrest for use if necessary.Power oflegislaturesof Britishpossessionsto add toextraditioncrimes.
    4. A fugitive criminal committed to prison under section eleven of the Extradition Act, 1870, ^^L^may, if he consents and does not wish to apply for a writ of habeas corpus, be surrendered before surrthe expiration of the fifteen days mentioned in that section, anything  in section three of that Actto the contrary notwithstanding.    5. A Secretary of State may by order vary the forms set out in the schedule to the ExtraditionAct, 1870, or prescribe new forms in lieu thereof, and may prescribe additional forms for any of thepurposes of that Act,  and all such forms shall have effect as if enacted in the said schedule.Forms.                               Part II. Fugitive Offenders.    6. A fugitive committed to prison under section five of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, may,if he consents and does not wish to apply for a writ of habeas corpus or other like process, be surrenderedbefore the expiration of the fifteen days mentioned in that section, and that section and section six of the same Act shall have effect accordingly.                                   Part III.-General.    7. (1) This Act may be cited as the Extradition and Fugitive Offenders Act,  1918.          Short title                                                                                      .and con-    (2) Part I of this Act shall be construed as one with the Extradition Acts, 1870 to 1906, and struction.those Acts and Part I of this Act may be cited together as the Extradition Acts, 1870 to  1918.    (3) Part II of this Act shall be construed as one with the Fugitive Offenders Acts, 1881 and 1915,and those Acts and Part II of this Act  may be cited together as the Fugitive Offenders Acts,1881 to 1918.            (3)-The  Colonial Prisoners Removal Acts,  1869  and  1884.     1.  The Colonial Prisoners Removal Act,  1869 (32 &amp; 33 Vic. c. 10),  providesfor agreement between two  Colonies for the removal of prisoners from one to theother.  Such agreements require the sanction of an Order in Council here. No agree-ment of this kind, however,  has ever been entered into by any Colony which nowforms a Dominion or part of a Dominion.     2.  The Colonial Prisoners Removal Act, 1884 (47 &amp; 48 Vic. c. 31),  provides forthe removal of prisoners and criminal lunatics from one British Possession to anotheror to the United Kingdom. Under the definition of &quot; British Possession &quot; containedin the Act  it applies directly to all parts of the Dominions and to India.   EveryDominion has, however,  long been  able to  make adequate provision  for its ownprisoners, and Dominion prisoners are not sent to the United Kingdom under thisAct.  There might,  perhaps,  be  some  rare  and exceptional case  in  which  a dominion  desired to do so, and recently a prisoner was,  in special  circumstances,removed from Southern Rhodesia (a self-governing Colony) to this country underthe Act.3.  For removing doubts it is hereby declared :                                                                                    Removal of  (1) that a warrant for  the apprehension of a fugitive  criminal under section eight of the certain ^       Extradition Act, 1870, may be issued before his arrival in the United Kingdom if it is points.       believed that he will shortly arrive there ;  (2) that evidence on oath of the commission of an offence within His Majesty&apos;s Dominions may       be taken in the absence of the accused for the purpose of supporting an application for       his extradition from a foreign country.
(1) CERTAIN  ACTS RELATING  TO  EVIDENCE.(2) THE BANKRUPTCY ACTS, 1914  AND 1926.(3) THE COMPANIES  ACTS.(4) THE COINAGE ACTS.(5) INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY.(6) AIR NAVIGATION.(1) Certain Acts relating to Evidence.         The British Law Ascertainment Act, 1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vic. c. 63).    1. This Act enables  a court in one part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions to remita case for the opinion of a court in another part thereof on any point on which thelaw of the latter is different from the law in force in the part where the remittingcourt  is situate.  The latter court is bound to apply the opinion when obtained butthe Judicial Committee or the House of Lords (as the case may be) on appeal  mayadopt or  reject the opinion.    The  Act applies to the superior courts of law or equity in the Dominions, butthere is no  information as to the extent,  if any, to which  they  avail themselves of it.         The Foreign Law Ascertainment Act, 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vic. c. 11).    2. This Act enables courts in His Majesty&apos;s dominions to remit a case to aforeign court for an opinion as to the foreign law applicable to the facts of the case,and conversely to pronounce an opinion as to their own law on a case remitted tothem by a foreign court.    The Act, however, only comes into operation in pursuance of conventions enteredinto with foreign States for the purpose,  and as it is understood that no suchconventions have at ^resent been made it remains ^racticalh7&quot; a dead letter.       The Evidence by Commission Acts, 1859 and 1885 (22 Vic. c. 20, and                             48 &amp; 49 Vic. c. 74).    3. These Acts provide for the taking of evidence in cases pending before courts in His Majesty&apos;s dominions in places out of the jurisdiction of such courts.    The court issues a commission or order for the examination of witnesses outof its  jurisdiction and the court within whose jurisdiction they are makes an order for their examination and the production of documents, etc., and generally enforcesthe order of the first-mentioned court as if it were its own.
    The Act of 1859 provides that  &quot; any Supreme Court in any of His Majesty&apos;scolonies or possessions abroad, and any judges of any such Court, and every judge in any such  colony or possession, who, by an order of His Majesty in Council maybe appointed for this  purpose,  shall respectively be Courts  and judges havingauthority  under this Act,&quot; and it enables the chief or only judge of the SupremeCourt in any of His Majesty&apos;s colonies or possessions abroad, so far as relates tosuch colony or possession, to make rules forgiving effect to the provisions of the Act,and regulating the procedure thereunder.         The Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act, .1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vic. c. 113).    4. This Act provides for the taking of evidence in  His Majesty&apos;s dominions in relation to civil and commercial matters pending before foreign  tribunals, and section 24 of the Extradition Act,  1870, extends its provisions to criminal mattersof a non-political character so pending.    The  Act contains provisions similar to those contained in the Evidence byCommission Act, 1859, with regard to the judges who are to have authority underthe Act in the colonies, but differs from that Act in conferring the rule-makingpower on the Lord Chancellor, with the assistance of  two of the judges of  theCourts of Common Law at Westminster (now the Supreme Court Rule Committee).    The  practice  under both Acts is regulated by the same rules in England  (seeRules of  the Supreme Court, Order 37, rules 54-60).    It would appear that the Dominions, in general, have adopted similar rules of practice,  both as regards the Evidence  by Commission Act  and as regards  theForeign Tribunals Evidence Act.              The Evidence Act, 1851 (14 &amp; 15 Vic. c. 99), Section 11.    5.  Under this Section every document which, under any law for the time being in force, is admissible in the English or Irish Courts without proof of seal, stamp,or signature or of the judicial or official character of the person signing the same ismade admissible to the same extent and for the same purposes in any court of anyof the British colonies without proof of seal, stamp, or signature or of the judicialor official character of the person signing the same.    Several of the Dominions have already re-enacted, without material alteration,the substance of this provision in its relation to themselves.                 (2)-The Bankruptcy Acts, 1914  and 1926.    1.  The  Bankruptcy Acts, 1914 and 1926 (4 &amp; 5, Geo. V, c. 59, and  16 &amp; 17Geo. V, c. 7), which contain the bankruptcy code at present in force apply in some respects to the Dominions.    2.  By Section 122 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914 (commonly  known as  the mutual aid section), it is provided that the High Court, County Courts,  Courtshaving jurisdiction in bankruptcy in  Scotland  and Ireland and every BritishCourt elsewhere having jurisdiction in bankruptcy or insolvency, and the officersof those Courts, respectively, shall severally act in aid of and be auxiliary to eachother in all  matters of bankruptcy, and that an Order of the Court seeking  aidwith a request to another of the said Courts shall be deemed sufficient to enablethe latter Court to  exercise,  in regard to matters directed by  the Order, suchjurisdiction as either the Court which made the request or the Court to which  therequest was  made would exercise in regard to  similar matters within theirrespective jurisdiction.
     3.  By  Section 167 of the Bankruptcy Act,  1914, the property which passes on an Order of Adjudication is defined as money, goods, land and every description of property whether situate in England or elsewhere, and it has been held that a bankrupts property in the Dominions passes to  the Trustee in an English bank- ruptcy subject, in the case of land, to any local requirements as to the  conditions necessary to effect a transfer of real estate there.  (Ellis v. MacHenry, L.R. 6, CP. 228 and Cullender v. Lagos, 1891, A.C. 460.)     4.  Whether a Dominion adjudication passes property of the bankrupt outside the territorial  limits  of that Dominion was formerly  open to  some  doubt.  The better opinion, however,  now appears to be that the mutual aid section in the English Act of 1914 is properly construed as giving as a matter of practice extra- territorial effect  to  a  Dominion adjudication re  Levy&apos;s  Trust, 30  Chancery Division 119.     5. An  order of  discharge from  an English bankruptcy under  an Imperial Act (which  includes for this purpose the  Scottish Act)  is a good defence to an action of debt  in any part of the Dominions no matter what the  law of the  debt may be (New Zealand Loan Company v. Morrison, 1898, A.C. 359).  On the other hand an order for  discharge under a Dominion  Statute is probably not a  good discharge  outside the  jurisdiction of  the Dominion unless by  the law  governing the debt such an order operates as a discharge, e.g., it has been held  that a discharge from a Victorian bankruptcy is not a good  discharge from a debt governed by thelaw of England (Bartley v. Hodges, 1861, 1 B. and S. 375).                           (3) The Companies Acts.     1.  The Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908 (8 Ed. VII, c. 69), does not apply in  the  Dominions except with regard to the keeping of Colonial Registers  byBritish  companies. By Section 34 of the Act provision is made  that a companywhose objects comprise the transaction of business in a Colony may, if authorised by its articles, cause to be kept in any Colony in which it transacts business a branchregister of members  resident in that Colony.  By Section 35 it is provided thatthis Colonial Register shall be kept in the same manner in  which  the  principalregister is required by the Act to be kept, and that any competent court in theColony may exercise the same jurisdiction of rectifying the register as under the Actis exercisable  by the  High Court  in  England and, further,  that the offences of refusing inspection or copies of the Colonial Register may be prosecuted summarilybefore any tribunal in the Colony having summary criminal jurisdiction.     2. Mention should also be made of the Companies Act, 1928 (18 &amp; 19 Geo.  V,c. 45), which was passed in August  of  1928 but which  does not come into force until a  day to  be fixed by Order in Council.  It is  hoped that the  necessary legislation to consolidate all the Companies  Acts will  be passed during the year1929, and in the consolidated Act the provisions of the Act of 1928 will be included.     3. By Section 10 of that Act amendments are made in Section 34 of the act of 1908 above referred to.  The effect of these amendments  is that a  Companyhaving a share capital, whose  objects comprise the transaction of business in anypart of His Majesty&apos;s  dominions outside Great Britain, the Channel Islands, or the isle of Man, may cause to be kept in such part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions in whichit transacts business a Branch Register of members resident in that part, and for references to a &quot; Colonial Register &quot; wherever they occur in the Act of 1908 or  inany Articles of Association, there is substituted a reference to a &quot;Dominion Register.&quot;Provision is also made for punishment by fine  of Companies in default in complying with the provisions of Subsection (2) of Section 34, and Subsection (3)  of Section 35of the Act of 1908, which provide for the notification of the situation of a BranchRegister to the  Registrar of Companies, and for the keeping at  the RegisteredOffice of the Company of a duplicate of the Dominion Register.
    4. By Section  11 of the 1928 Act provision is made that if by virtue of thelaw in force in any of His Majesty&apos;s dominions outside Great Britain, companiesincorporated under that law have power to keep in Great Britain Branch registers of their members resident in Great Britain, His Majesty may, by Order in Council,direct that Sections 30  and 32 of the Companies Act, 1908, which deal, with the inspection of the Register and the power of the Court to rectify the Register shall,subject to any modifications and  adaptations specified in the Order, apply to suchBranch Registers kept in Great Britain.                            (4) The Coinage Acts.    1.  The coinage of money and matters relating thereto are part of the royal prerogative, though now regulated by a series of Statutes the most important ofwhich for the present purpose are the Coinage Act, 1870 (37 Vic. c. 10), subsequentlyamended by the Coinage Act, 1891 (54 &amp; 55 Vic. c. 72), and the Coinage Act,  1920(10 Geo. V, c. 3).  It  is an interesting but unprofitable speculation whether theoriginal prerogative powers in relation to the coinage still exist, or are to be regardedas superseded by existing legislation.    2.  There is no record of the grant of this prerogative  to the Governor of a dominion.   It is a branch of the prerogative which, subject to Imperial legislation,can be exercised by the self-governing Dominions, and in fact local Statutes on thesubject have been passed in all the Dominions with the exception of New Zealand.The British North America Act,  1867, and the Commonwealth of Australia Act,1900, reserve the exclusive power of legislating on coinage and legal tender to theDominion  and  Commonwealth  Pailiaments, respectively,  while  in the  otherDominions the  power  is derived  from the right to legislate  for the peace, order,and good government in the Dominion constitution.  By Section 4 of the Govern-ment of Ireland Act,  1920,  the Parliament  of Northern Ireland is expressly pro-hibited from making laws in respect of coinage, legal tender,  and negotiable instru-ments  including bank notes.  The right of disallowance has been not infrequentlyexercised in the  case  of Dominion legislation on coinage matters, though not ofrecent  years ; the history of the subject is exhaustively dealt with in Lord Chalmers&apos;book on Colonial Currency (1893).    3. The Imperial coinage legislation, however, is still applicable to the dominions to the  limited extent indicated in the following paragraphs.    4.  The Coinage Act,  1870, a consolidating and amending Statute, enacts a standard of weight and fineness for all coins and regulates the  amounts for whichparticular classes of coins shall be legal tender. It prohibits the making and issuingof coinage  except by the  Mint, and provides that all profits received by the Mintshall be paid into the Exchequer.  It further empowers His Majesty, with the advice of the Privy Council,  from time to time by Proclamation (inter  alia) to determine the dimension and design of any coin and the denomination  of  coins to be coinedat the Mint ; to call in coins of any date or denomination ;  to direct that the coinscoined in any foreign country shall be current and be a legal tender at such ratesand up to such amounts and in such portion of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions as may be specified in the Proclamation ;  to direct the establishment  of any branch of theMint in any British Possession, to impose a charge for the coinage of gold thereat,to determine the application of such charge and to determine the extent to which such branch is  to be deemed part of the Mint and to which  coins issued therefromare to be current and  be legal tender ; to direct that the whole  or any part of theAct shall apply to and be enforced in any British Possession with or without any modifications contained in the Proclamation ;  and to regulate any matters relative to the coinage  at the Mint within the existing prerogative of the Crown which  arenot provided for by the Act. The Act of 1891 amends the  Act of 1870 in certainparticulars not  material to the present purpose.   The Act of 1920 makes further amendments in the earlier Act and provides that where, by virtue of a Proclamationmade  under the Act of 1870, the whole  or any part of  that  Act is in force in any british Possession, the Act of 1870 shall apply in that Possession as amended by. theAct of 1920, but in the case of the self-governing Dominions only if the provisionsof the Act of 1920 are adopted as regards the Dominion by a Proclamation of theGovernor-General or  Governor.
     5.  By a Proclamation dated the 1st August, 1896, and issued under the act of 1870, certain sections of the Act, as amended by the Act of 1891, were appliedto the six Australian States and to New Zealand, the Order in Council by which the proclamation was approved directing that the Proclamation itself should take effect in each Colony as from the date of its promulgation in the Colony.  In New zealand the Proclamation is still in force ; but the establishment of the Commonwealth ofAustralia in 1900 with its reservation of coinage legislation to the CommonwealthParliament was followed by a Commonwealth Act of 1909 which dealt with coinageand legal tender of the Commonwealth and provided for a new Commonwealth silvercoinage. This Act superseded the Proclamation of 1896 so far as regards Australia,but in order to make it valid (by reason of the Colonial Laws Validity Act) a furtherProclamation  was  necessary repealing that of 1896,  and this was duly issued on23rd January, 1911.    6.  A Proclamation under the Act of 1870, dated  the 29th November, 1881,applied the whole of the Act of 1870 to the Cape of Good Hope and Natal, and afurther  Proclamation of the  16th February, 1906, applied certain parts of the act of 1870, as amended by the Act of 1891,  to the Transvaal.  A later Proclamationof the 23rd  January, 1911, revoked the earlier Proclamation and applied certain sections of the Act of 1870, as so amended, to the whole of the Union of  SouthAfrica.   Under the Union of South Africa Coinage Act, 1922, the Union Govern-ment has power to issue  its  own bronze  and  silver coin, and  this power is recognised by a Proclamation of 14th December, 1922.    7.  There  is no Proclamation under the Act of 1870 in force in Canada, but a canadian Act of 1871 provided for the issue of a Royal Proclamation fixing the nominal rates  at which coins struck for use in  Canada should be current.  A laterCanadian Act, however,  in 1910 transferred to the Governor-General in Council the proclamation-making power.  Though the Act  of 1871 contemplated the issue of a canadian gold coinage, no gold coins were in fact  struck  in  Canada until theestablishment  of the Ottawa Mint in 1907.    8.  In Newfoundland  there appears  to haye been a  combination of local legislation and Royal Proclamations.  In  accordance with a local Act of 1873,a Proclamation was issued on the 9th August/1870, authorising a special coinage tobe struck at the Royal Mint for Newfoundland.  The local Act at present in force is the Currency Act, 1917, which [inter alia\ empowers His Majesty in Council to cause new coins to be struck for Newfoundland and to fix the rates at which Americangold coins shall be legal tender.    9.  The position in the Irish Free State is governed by the Free State CoinageAct, 1926, which provides for the issue of silver, nickel, and bronze  coins.of variousdenominations, and by the Free State Currency Act of  1927, which authorises theissue of  gold coinage, provides for the issue of currency  notes, etc.  The Irish FreeState are now arranging to issue a token coinage of their own.    10.   Among other powers conferred by the Act of  1870 upon  His Majesty inCouncil  is, as already stated, the power to issue Proclamations establishing branchMints in any British Possessions.  Before 1870, Proclamations for this purpose hadbeen issued under the prerogative and a branch Mint was so established at Sydney in1855,  and at Melbourne  in 1869.  By Proclamations issued under the Act of 1870,branch Mints were  established at Perth in 1898, at Ottawa in 1907,  and at Pretoriain 1911. Further provision was made by Proclamation in 1900 in relation to theMints at Melbourne and Sydney, but the Sydney Mint was ultimately discontinued(also by Proclamation) in 1926.  These branch Mints are ail under the control of theRoyal Mint and of the British Treasury, arrangements being made with the DominionGovernments for the payment by the latter to the British Government of the neces-sary establishment charges, the profits made by the branch Mint being paid intothe local Exchequer. The Ottawa Mint Proclamation, which  may be taken astypical,  is dated the 2nd November, 1907, and after declaring the establishmentof a branch of the Mint at or near Ottawa, provided that gold coins of the samedimensions,  designs,  weights,, and finenesses as gold coins coined  at the Mint inEngland might be coined at  the Ottawa Mint and should be  deemed to have beenissued from the Mint in  England and be current and a legal tender in like manner
 and to the same extent as if they had been coined in England. They are, therefore, legal tender wherever British gold coin is legal tender.  The Proclamation further provides that, subject to any regulations  and conditions which may be made by the Master of the Mint in England, the Ottawa Mint shall coin there any gold, silver, bronze, or other coins which the Governor-General of the Dominion desires to be so coined, and which is for the time being a coin of the  Dominion and current and legal tender in the Dominion ;  but the coins so coined shall not for the purposes of the Coinage Act, 1870, be deemed to be coins made at or issued at. the Mint in England. They  are, therefore, legal tender only within the  limits of the Dominion.   The Canadian silver coinage is now struck at the Ottawa Mint, and the Australian silver coinage at one or other of the Australian Mints.  Similarly in South Africa  the branch Mint is engaged in preparing local token currency.     11. Proclamations have been issued under the Act of 1870 from time to time directing that foreign currency shall be a legal tender in various British Possessions at such rates and up  to such amounts as  may be  specified in the  Proclamation ; and also making legal tender elsewhere than the country of origin coins struck at any of the branch Mints.  Similar Proclamations were issued before 1870 under the Royal prerogative. Thus, a  Proclamation  dated  the  19th August,  1853, declared gold coins made at the Sydney Mint to be a legal  tender in a&apos;number of British Possessions including the  Cape of Good Hope.     12. The control of note issues appears never to have been regarded as part of the prerogative, and though local Acts on the subject have from time to time been disallowed for various reasons, there is no case in which any Proclamation has been issued regulating the note issues in a  Dominion, nor is there any Imperial Statute authorising the issue of any such Proclamation. A local Newfoundland Act, however, expressly provided in  1919 that the. Act should only  come into operation upon a date to be appointed for  the purpose by a Proclamation of the Governor to the effect that the Act had been approved and confirmed by His Majesty  in Council. This approval was signified by an Order in Council  dated the 29th October, 1919, which was followed by a Proclamation of the Governor dated the 3rd March, 1920.     13.  It will be seen, therefore, that matters relating to currency in the Dominions may be regulated  at the present time either (1)  by local legislation ;   or  (2) by Proclamation under the Act of 1870 ;  or (3) partly  by local legislation  and partly by Proclamation.  In Australia, Canada, Newfoundland,  and the Irish Free State, the currency at the present time is for the most part regulated by local legislation, though Proclamations  relating to the  branch Mints  in Australia and Canada still remain in force ; in New Zealand and, to some extent, in the Union of South Africa by Proclamations  under the Act of 1870.   It should be observed that  the Act of 1870 is  not employed to regulate questions of currency which are domestic to the Dominion.   The Dominions have  a  free hand so  far as their token coinage is, concerned, e.g., Section 6  (1) of the  Union of South Africa Coinage  Act,  1922, provides that  :           &quot; The Governor General may, by proclamation in the Gazette, do any      of the following  things :         (a) determine the dimensions of and design for any Union coin,         (b) diminish the amount of the remedy allowed in the case of Union coins,         (c) determine  the  least current weight of  any Transvaal  or Union  coin              other than gold coin,         (d) call in Transvaal coins or  Union coins of any  date or denomination,         (e) revoke or alter any such proclamation previously issued.&quot;    14. To sum up, the machinery of Proclamations under the Act  of 1870  isonly used, so far as the Dominions are concerned, to direct the establishment andto regulate the operations of the branch Mints (which have, the privilege of coiningsovereigns and half-sovereigns) or to regulate the token coinage in those Dominions(e.g., New Zealand) which have elected to retain British silver in circulation.

1926.  November 5.     Sydney Mint  (Discontinuance) Proclamation,  1926, discontinuing the branchof the Mint at Sydney.     In  addition there  were three  Proclamations issued on  28th  July,  1916,20th  June,  1922,  and 25th  July,  1924, regulating the payment  to be. made forbullion by the Australian Branch Mints.  The last of these expired in 1925.    There are  also two  Orders in Council relating  to  Newfoundland, one  of9th August, 1870,  approving a  Proclamation giving currency in Newfoundland tocertain gold, silver, and bronze coins, the other of 29th October, 1919, approvingand  confirming the Newfoundland Notes Act,  1919.   In  each case the  Order inCouncil was required by virtue of a clause in a local Act.                           (5) Industrial Property.     1.  The Copyright  Act of 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. V, c. 46) prima facie does not extend  to a  Dominion.   Uniformity  of law,  however, can be, and  has been,secured by the alternative machinery described below.     2.  The first alternative employed by the Commonwealth of Australia, theUnion of South Africa, and Newfoundland is  direct adoption of the  1911 Act.Under Section 25 (1) the Dominion Legislature can declare that Act to be in forcein the Dominion &quot; either without any modifications and additions or with such modifications  and additions relating  exclusively  to procedure and  remedies ornecessary to adapt this Act to the circumstances of the Dominion as may be enacted by such Legislature.&quot;     3.  The second alternative, to which recourse was had in the case of New zealand and Canada, is  that  of officially recognising the equivalent  effect of  legislation passed  by the Dominion.   Under Section  25 (2)  when a  Dominion  has passedlegislation giving &quot; substantially  identical &quot; rights to works of which the authors(at the date  of  making the works)  were either British  subjects resident&apos; outsidethe  Dominion or  non-British  subjects resident in some part of His Majesty&apos;sdominions to which the Act extends, then the Secretary of State may certify thatfact by notice in the London Gazette and  thereupon, so long as such legislationcontinues in force, the Dominion  is treated  (for the purpose of rights conferred bythe Act) as one to which the Act  extends.     Section 26  expressly authorises a Dominion to repeal or amend copyrightenactments (including  the  1911  Act)  passed by the Imperial  Parliament,  andcontains a further provision for reciprocity.     4.  Under Section 3 of  the  Irish Free  State Constitution Act, the  FreeState Parliament  could have  adopted the 1911 Act as an Act  applicable to a dominion. This step  has not been taken.  By the Irish  Free  State  industrial and Commercial Property  (Protection) Act (No. 16 of 1927)  the Free State  hasrepealed the  1911  Act.   This Act confers rights limited in certain respects, e.g.,right of protection against translations as compared with  the Copyright Act of1911, and the Secretary of State has  not found it possible to issue a  certificateunder Section 25 (2).   Negotiations  are, however,  proceeding with the Irish FreeState with a view to the issue of an Order in Council under Section 26 (3), by whichsubstantial reciprocity will  be  secured.     5.  International copyright depends upon the application of the 1911  Act byOrder in  Council  to  foreign  countries which undertake to  give correspondingfacilities.  The principal Order in Council of 24th June, 1912, amended and extendedalmost every year since, applied the Act (as modified) to the various countries ofthe Copyright Union.   The Order is expressly excluded from  application to  theDominions.   The  Governors in  Council  of Dominions  to  which the  1911 Actextends can make similar Orders in Council in relation to their respective Dominionswith like effect.    6. Provisions  also exist for the mutual protection of patents, designs, andtrade marks throughout the Empire.
                             (6) Air Navigation.     1. The only legislation relating to air navigation in force in this country isthe Air Navigation Act, 1920 (10 &amp; 11  Geo. V, c. 80).  Apart from the question of jurisdiction mentioned in paragraph 2  below, this Act is not expressed to apply tothe Dominions, and  such  application is by implication excluded by Section 4 (1)whereby power is given by Order in Council to extend, with any necessary modi-fications or exceptions, any of the provisions of the Act to any British Possessionsother than those mentioned in the Schedule to the Act, and to any territory under his  Majesty&apos;s protection.   The  Possessions mentioned in the Schedule consist ofthe Dominions (as then existing, that  is, not including the Irish Free State), andIndia ;  and by the proviso to Section 4 (1) &quot; territory under His Majesty&apos;s pro-tection &quot; is defined as excluding any territory over which the Government of anypart of His Majesty&apos;s dominions mentioned in the Schedule exercises authority.     2. Under Section 14 (1), any  offence under the Act, or under  an Order inCouncil or regulations made thereunder, and any offence  whatever committed ona British aircraft is,  for the  purpose of conferring jurisdiction, to be deemed tohave been committed in any place  where the offender may for the time being  be.By Article 2 of the Air Navigation (Consolidation) Order, 1923,  made under  theAct, the provisions  of  that  Order are expressed to apply  (unless the contraryintention appears) to all British aircraft registered in Great Britain and NorthernIreland wherever such aircraft may be.  Jurisdiction is thus claimed over offences committed abroad, including offences committed in the Dominions, in or in respectof British aircraft registered in  Great  Britain and Northern Ireland.  But apartfrom this point, and  the special position of the Irish Free State, the Act of 1920 isregarded as having no application to the Dominions, all of which (except the IrishFree State and possibly Newfoundland) have passed air legislation of their own.The position in the Irish  Free State is that, presumably under Article 73 of theConstitution, the Act of 1920 is  in force there, subject to certain adaptations and modifications which have been made by Order of the Executive Council under the(Irish Free State) Adaptation of  Enactments Act, 1922.     3. As regards future air legislation, it should be observed that  as regardsInternational  relations the most important matters are governed by rules laiddown  in  or under the International Air Navigation Convention  of  the 13thOctober,  1919, to which  the United Kingdom, all the Dominions and India  areparties.  In practice similar rules  are likely  to  govern inter-Imperial  relations.The Convention does not extend to  questions of  private aerial law, but other international Conventions with  a  view to  obtaining uniformity on these matters are in prospect.
CERTAIN LEGISLATION OF WHICH  THE OPERATIVE EFFECT IS MAINLY                 IN  RELATION  TO FOREIGN TERRITORY.      (1)  THE FOREIGN JURISDICTION ACTS, 1890 AND  1913.      (2)  EXTRA-TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF OFFENCES              COMMITTED ON LAND BY  BRITISH  SUBJECTS.      (3)  STATUTORY FUNCTIONS OF  BRITISH  CONSULAR OFFICERS.              (1)-The Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, 1890 and 1913.    1. This section  of this Chapter refers only to the exercise of  jurisdictionunder the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts over British subjects in countries where such persons possess ex-territorial rights  and are consequently withdrawn from thejurisdiction of the local courts.   It does not deal with the operation of the Acts inBritish Protectorates, mandated territories, etc..    2. The  jurisdiction which  &quot; by  treaty, capitulation, grant,  usage, suffranee,and other lawful  means His  Majesty has within  divers  foreign countries &quot; is exercised  under&apos; the  Foreign Jurisdiction Acts,  1890 and 1913 (53  &amp; 54 Vic.c. 37,  and 3 &amp; 4 Geo.. V, c.  16).  Under  these Acts it is lawful for  His  majesty in Council to make provision for the exercise of such jurisdiction, and in each ofthe  countries in question there  is one or more Orders in Council made under theActs (under  the advice  of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain), prescribingor constituting the body of law  applicable  to British subjects in that country, and establishing  courts to administer it.   The general scheme is to apply English (orin some cases Indian)  law with such modifications or additions as local circum-stances may necessitate.    3. This body of law is applicable  to  all  British subjects (including Britishregistered companies)  and  British ships when within the country  in question,irrespective  of the part of the Empire from which  they may come;  there areoccasionally special provisions applicable only to Asiatics or other particular classesof British subjects, but  these are not material to the present question.   The Courtsestablished by these  Orders  in Council have similarly jurisdiction over all Britishsubjects in the county ; they are usually held by  consular officers, and wherethere  are barrister judges these  are appointed by His Majesty on the advice of theForeign Secretary from among the members of the English Bar.   The expense ofmaintaining these courts, so far as they are not  self-supporting, is borne by the diplomatic and Consular Vote,  i.e.,by the taxpayer  of the United Kingdom. -(2) Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction in Respect of Offences Committed on Land  by                              British Subjects.    1.  The original criminal  jurisdiction of the  courts in England which  atcommon law was confined to offences committed within the body of the realm andwas distinct from the jurisdiction exercised by the Admiral over British ships  onthe high seas and elsewhere has from time  to time been extended by Statute soas to enable those courts to try British subjects for certain offences committed  on land outside the realm, whether in some other part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions orin foreign territory.   Cases in which such jurisdiction has been conferred are treason(25 Edw. 3, st. 5, c. 2 ; 35 Hen. 8, c. 2), treason felony  (11.&amp; 12 Vic. c. 12) ;  murderand manslaughter (Offences Against the Person Act,  1861  (24 &amp;  25 Vic. c. 100,sections 9 and 10) ;  bigamy  (section 57 of that Act) ;  offences against the official secrets Acts, 1911  and 1920 (1 &amp; 2 Geo.  V, c. 28, and 10 &amp; 11 Geo. V, c. 75)  ; the
Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vic. c. 90) ;  misdemeanours committed inIndia (13 Geo. 3, c. 63, section 39) ;  and offences committed by persons employedin any public service out of Great Britain (42 Geo. 3, c. 85,  section 1).   the enactments in question apply to all British subjects.    2.  As regards the criminal  jurisdiction of the Courts of  the Dominions, theposition  appears to be that under the law as it stands at present that jurisdictiondoes not  extend to  offences committed outside the limits of their territory and territorial waters except in so far as it has been otherwise  provided by Imperialenactments, including the Dominion Constitution Acts.   Hence the Dominions,in the  absence  of  authority conferred  by   Imperial  enactments,  are  not ina position legally to  apply their own criminal laws extra-territorially.  On -theprinciple laid  down in  MacLeod v. Attorney-General for New South Wales (1891),A.C. 445, the general authority in their Constitution Acts to make laws for peace,order and good government would not enable  them to enact legislation conferringjurisdiction on their Courts to try British subjects for offences committed outside their  territorial  limits and waters.              (3) Statutory Functions  of British  Consular Officers.    1. Certain functions are  conferred on. British consular officers by or underenactments  of the Imperial Parliament, and, speaking generally, these functionsare at present exercised  by them in relation to any British subject who may be concerned irrespective of the part of the Empire from which he comes.    This section- of this Chapter  does not deal  with functions performed byConsuls under the Merchant Shipping Act.                               Notarial  Duties.    2. Under the Commissioners for Oaths Acts,  1889, and 1891 (52 &amp; 53  Vic.c.  10,  and  54 &amp; 55 Vic.  c.  50)  any British diplomatic  or  consular  officer&quot; exercising his  functions in any  foreign  place may, in that country or place,administer any oath and take any affidavit and also do any notarial act which any Notary Public can do within the United Kingdom ;  and every Oath, affidavitand notarial act administered, sworn or done by or before any such person, shallbe  as effectual as if duly administered, sworn  or  done by or before any  lawfulauthority in any part of the United  Kingdom,&quot; and any document bearing the sealand signature of any such official is-to  be admitted in evidence without proof ofthe seal Or signature or of the official character of the officer concerned.   - 3. It would seem that this provision only makes the documents with whichit deals valid in the United Kingdom, but it is understood that in practice consular officers perform  the functions in question  irrespective of the part of  the Empirefrom which the applicant (if he &quot;be a British subject) comes, or in which the document is to be used.    4.  Legislation has been passed by some of the Canadian Provinces and three off the Australian States  on the lines of  Section 6 of the Act of 1889 summarised above and a similar provision has been made by rule in the Union of SouthAfrica.  Moreover, legislation has been passed by New Zealand and newfoundland and three  of the Australian  States substantially  re-enacting Section 11  of theEvidence Act, 1851 (14 &amp; 15 Vic. c, 99), under  which every document admissiblein an English court without proof of seal or signature or of the official character ofthe officer concerned is made admissible  to the  same extent and for the samepurposes in the  courts of New Zealand, etc., without proof of seal or signature orthe official character of  the officer  concerned.   Dominion legislation of this kind,therefore, covers consular documents which are made admissible in English courtsby the Act of 1889.
                              Foreign Marriages.    5. Under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1892 (55 &amp; 56 Vic.  c. 23), all marriagesbetween parties, of whom one at least is a British subject, solemnized in accordancewith the Act by or before a diplomatic or consular officer who is a marriage officerwithin the meaning of the Act (i.e., who holds a marriage warrant), &quot; shall be asvalid in law as if the same had been solemnized in the United Kingdom with a dueobservance of all forms required by law.&quot;  The Foreign Marriages Order in Council,1913, made under power conferred by the Act, provides the detailed regulations forthe exercise of the function in  question.  The power which is given by the Act andOrder to dispense with certain requirements as to notice, etc., is exercised by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    Apart from the question  of persons professing polygamous  religions, no dis-tinction is made, in the application of the Act, between different classes of Britishsubjects.  If a Consul is requested to marry a British subject under the Act andthe statutory requirements are complied with, he would not  enquire from whatpart of the Empire the applicant came.                       Employment of Children  Abroad.    6.  Under the Children (Employment Abroad) Act,  1913  (3 &amp; 4 Geo. V, c. 7),certain functions are conferred upon  consular officers  in  relation to children inrespect of whom licences have been granted under the  Act allowing them to go out of the United Kingdom for the purpose of singing, playing, etc., for profit.
                             CHAPTER  IX.CONSTITUENT   AND  FEDERATING   INSTRUMENTS   (INCLUDING   THECOLONIAL BOUNDARIES ACT, 1895), RESERVATION,  AND DISALLOWANCE.      (1) DOMINION CONSTITUTIONS.               (a) PROVISIONS REQUIRING  BILLS TO BE RESERVED.               (b) PROVISIONS ENABLING DOMINIONS TO  ALTER THEIR                    CONSTITUTIONS.               (c) EXPRESS LIMITATIONS  IN  DOMINION  CONSTITUTIONS                    AS TO THE SUBJECTS ON  WHICH LEGISLATION MAY                    BE ENACTED.      (2) THE COLONIAL  BOUNDARIES ACT, 1895.      (3) THE PREROGATIVE OF  MERCY.      (4) THE COLONIAL  STOCK ACTS.                        (1) Dominion Constitutions.            (A) PROVISIONS REQUIRING  BILLS TO BE RESERVED.*    Australia. By Section 74 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia(1900) it is provided that the Commonwealth Parliament  may make laws limiting the matters in which special leave to appeal from the High Court of Australia toHis Majesty in Council may be asked.  But proposed laws containing any suchlimitation  shall be reserved by the Governor-General for His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.    Canada. Nil.    Irish  Free State. Nil.    Newfoundland. Nil.    New  Zealand. By Section 65 of 15 and  16 Vic. c. 72 (the New Zealand Con-stitution Act, 1852) the General Assembly of New Zealand is given power to alter the sums  allocated by the  schedule for the  Governors  salary, the  Judges, theestablishment of the general government and native purposes respectively, but any bill altering the salary of the Governor or the sum allocated to native purposes&quot; shall be reserved for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure thereon.&quot;    (This  section  is one of those  (vide post) which the General Assembly is notempowered to alter or repeal).    South Africa.-Section 64 of the South Africa Act, 1909 (9, Edw. VII, c. 9),provides that all Bills repealing or amending that section or any of the provisionsof Chapter IV under the  heading  &quot; House of Assembly &quot; and all Bills abolishingprovincial councils or abridging the  powers conferred on them under Section 85,otherwise  than in  accordance with the provisions of that section shall be reservedfor the signification of His Majesty&apos;s  pleasure.    Section 106 of the A.ct contains a provision similar to  that in Section 74 of theConstitution of the Commonwealth  of Australia  (ante).  By Section 25 of theSchedule to the Act  which lays down the terms and conditions on which theGovernor  in  Council may  undertake the  government of  native  territoriestransferred to the.Union under Section 151  it is provided that all Bills to amendor alter the provisions of  this Schedule  shall be reserved for the  signification ofHis Majesty&apos;s pleasure.    * There are also  provisions in certain other Imperial enactments requiring the reservation ofDominion legislation,  viz., the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 (see page  14 above), and theMerchant Shipping Act, 1894 (see separate memorandum relating to merchant shipping legislation).
   (B) PROVISIONS ENABLING DOMINIONS TO ALTER  THEIR CONSTITUTIONS.    Australia. By Section 128 of the  Constitution  of  the Commonwealth  ofAustralia it is provided as follows :   -           &quot; This Constitution shall not be altered except in the following manner:-           The proposed  law for the alteration thereof must be  passed  by an      absolute majority of each House of the Parliament, and not less than two      nor more than six  months after its passage through both Houses the pro-      posed law shall be submitted in each State to the electors qualified to vote      for the  election of members of the House of Representatives.           But if  either  House passes any  such proposed  law  by an absolute      majority, and the other House rejects or fails to pass it or passes it with any      amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree, and if after      an interval  of three months the first-mentioned House in the same or the      next  session again  passes the proposed law by  an absolute  majority with      or without any amendment which has been made or agreed to by the other      House,  and  such  other House rejects or fails to pass it or passes it with any      amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree, the Governor-      General may submit the proposed law as last proposed by the first-mentioned      House,  and either  with or  without  any amendments  subsequently  agreed      to by both  Houses, to the  electors in each State qualified to vote for the      election of the House of Representatives.           When a proposed law is submitted to the electors the vote shall be      taken in such   manner  as the  Parliament prescribes.  But  until the      qualification of electors and members of  the  House of  Representatives      becomes uniform throughout the Commonwealth, only one-half the electors      voting  for and against the  proposed law shall be counted in any State in      which adult suffrage prevails.           And  if  in a  majority  of the States a majority of the electors voting      approve the proposed law, and if a majority of all the electors voting also      approve the proposed law, it shall be presented to the Governor-General      for the  Queen&apos;s assent.           No alteration   diminishing the proportionate representation of any      State in  either  House  of  the  Parliament, or  the minimum number  of      Representatives of  a State  in the House of Representatives, or increasing,      diminishing, or otherwise altering the limits of the State, or in any manner      affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation thereto shall become      law  unless the majority of the electors voting  in  that State approve  the      proposed law.&quot;    Canada. Nil.    Irish Free State. Article 50  of the Constitution of the Irish Free  State  setforth in the first Schedule to the  &quot; Constituent Act &quot; set forth in the Schedule tothe Irish Free  State Constitution, 1922, provides as follows :              . &quot;           &quot; Amendments of this Constitution within  the terms of  the  Scheduled      Treaty  may be made by the Oireachtas, but no such amendment, passed by      both Houses  of  the Oireachtas,  after the expiration  of a period of eight      years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall      become law, unless the same shall,  after it has been passed or deemed to      have been passed  by the  said two-Houses of  the Oireachtas, have been      submitted to a Referendum of the people, and unless a majority of the voters      on the  register shall have recorded their votes on such Referendum, and      either the votes  of  a majority of the  voters on the register, or two-thirds      of the votes recorded, shall have been cast in favour of such amendment.      Any such amendment may be made within the said period of eight years by      way of ordinary legislation and as such shall be subject to  the provisions      of Article 47 hereof.&quot;    The Article 47 referred to above provides for  the suspension of the operationof Bills passed by both Houses and their submission by  Referendum to the decisionof the people.
     Newfoundland. Nil.     New Zealand. Section 2 of 20 and 21 Vic. c. 53 provides that 15 and 16 Vic. c. 72 (New Zealand Constitution Act, 1852), may  be altered or repealed by the General Assembly of New Zealand except Sections 32, 44, .46, 47, 53, 54, 56-59, 61, 64, 65, 71 and 80, which contain provisions relating (inter alia) to the establishment of a General Assembly and its power to make laws, assent to and reservation and disallowance of laws, the grant of the sums mentioned in the schedule for civil and judicial services, and the  power of the  General Assembly  to alter such  sums, and the maintenance of native laws and customs.     South Africa. By Section 152  of the South Africa Act, 1909, it is provided as follows :            &quot; Parliament may by  law repeal or alter  any of the provisions  of       this Act :           Provided that no provision thereof, for the operation of which a definite       period  of  time is prescribed, shall during such  period  be repealed  or       altered : and           Provided further that no repeal or alteration of the provisions contained       in this Section, or in Sections 33 and 34 (until the number of members of       the House of Assembly has reached the limit therein prescribed, or until a       period of ten years has elapsed after the establishment of the Union, which-       ever is the longer period), or in Sections 35  and 137,  shall be valid unless       the Bill embodying such repeal or alteration shall be passed by both Houses       of Parliament sitting together, and at the third reading be agreed to by not       less than two-thuds of the  total  number  of  members of both  Houses.      A Bill  so passed at such joint sitting  shall  be  deemed to  have been duly       passed  by both Houses of Parliament.&quot; (C) EXPRESS LIMITATIONS IN  DOMINION CONSTITUTIONS AS TO THE  SUBJECTS                  ON WHICH LEGISLATION MAY BE ENACTED.     There do not  appear to be any such express statutory limitations in any of the Dominion Constitutions on the general power to legislate for the peace,  order and good government of the Dominion,  except that (1) in  certain cases the  legislative capacity of a Federal Parliament is limited in consequence of the distribution under the Constitution of the legislative power between itself and the Provincial or State legislatures ;  and (2) in the case of the Irish Free State there is an express limitation laid  down in Section 2 of the &quot; Constituent Act &quot; (referred to above) under which any law passed by the Irish Free State Legislature which is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the Articles of Agreement  for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and  inoperative, and the Parliament and  the Executive Council of the Irish Free State shall respectively  pass such further legislation and do all such other things as may be necessary to implement the said Articles of Agreement.     In the  case of New Zealand, whilst  there is no express limitation  as  to the subjects on which legislation may be enacted, Section 53  of  15 and  16 Vic. c. 72 (the  New Zealand  Constitution Act, 1852) gives the  General Assembky power &quot;to  make laws for  the peace,  order,  and good government of New Zealand,provided that  no such laws be repugnant to the law of England.&quot;    This Section,as indicated under (B) above, is one of the Sections of the Act of  1852 which theGeneral Assembly of New Zealand has no power to alter.                    (2) The Colonial Boundaries Act. 1895.                             (58 &amp; 59 Vic. c. 34.)    l.,This Act enables the boundaries of a Colony to be altered by Order inCouncil or Letters Patent but provides that the consent of a self-governing Colonymust be required for the alteration of their boundaries.    The self-governing Colonies as set o&apos;ut in the Schedule were :              Canada,             Newfoundland,             New Zealand,             The 6 Australian States, and             The Cape of Good Hope, and             Natal.
                       (3) The Prerogative  of  Mercy.    1.  The manner in which the prerogative  of mercy, always delegated to theGovernor-General or Governor of a Dominion or Colony, is to be exercisable by himis prescribed  in the  Letters Patent  constituting  his Office and/or  in the RoyalInstructions.   Nevertheless,  the  prerogative of mercy being an essential function of any system of government may be and not infrequently is the subject of dominion legislation.  In practice, however, Bills which  affect the prerogative have usuallybeen reserved.    2.  The provisions of the Letters Patent and/or Instructions relating to thismatter have varied from time to time,  but at the present day are substantially to&quot;the same effect in the case of all the Dominions.   In Canada the matter is  dealtwith in the Instructions  only, and by them the  Governor-General is authorised(1) to grant a pardon to any person convicted of any offence against the laws of theDominion, either free or subject to lawful conditions, to respite the execution ofany sentence, and to remit any fines, penalties or forfeitures which may become dueand payable to the Crown ;  but except where the offence has been of a politicalnature  he is forbidden to make  it a condition of remission of  sentence that the offender shall be banished from or shall absent himself from the Dominion ; (2) topardon any accomplice, when an offence has been committed against the laws ofthe Dominion for which the offender may be tried within the Dominion, who shall give such information as shall lead to the conviction of the principal offender.  TheGovernor-General  may not pardon or  reprieve without first receiving, in capitalcases, the advice of the Dominion Ministers, and in other cases the advice  of atleast one Minister ; and in any case in which the pardon or reprieve might directly affect Imperial interests, or those of any country or place beyond the jurisdiction of  the  Government of the Dominion, he is enjoined before deciding as to eitherpardon or reprieve to take those interests specially into his own personal considera-tion in conjunction with such advice as aforesaid.   The prerogative is exercised inthe Canadian Provinces by the Lieutenant-Governor by virtue of provincial Statutes,    2. The Commonwealth Constitution Act (Section 8) provided that the ColonialBoundaries Act should not  apply to any  Colony which  became a  State of theCommonwealth, but that the Commonwealth should be taken to be a self-governingColony for the purposes of that Act.    3. The South Africa  Act,  1909 (Section 7) provided that  upon any Colonyentering  the  Union the Colonial  Boundaries Act  should  cease to apply to thatColony but should apply to the Union.    4. The Act, therefore, applies to the Commonwealth  and the Union, in eachcase, as a whole and no longer to their component States or Provinces  individually.Moreover, there are provisions in the Commonwealth Constitution for the admissionof new States (Section 121), the  acquisition of Territories (Section 122) and the alteration of the limits of States (Section 123) and somewhat similar  provisions inthe South Africa  Act, as  to  the  alteration of the boundaries of the Provinces(Section  149) and the transfer to the Union of other South African Territories(Section 151).    5. In the case of the Commonwealth at any rate resort to the Colonial Bound-aries Act may in future be&apos; unnecessary.   For example,  if it should be decidedto hand over any islands in the Pacific to the Commonwealth, it could be done inpursuance of Section  122  of the Commonwealth Constitution though this wouldrequire an Order in Council or Letters Patent issued here.   Territories handed overin this way, however (e.g., Norfolk Island and Papua), are not included withinthe boundaries of the  Commonwealth and do not form part of it.    6. The  Cook Islands were  included  in  New  Zealand (before it became a Dominion) by an  Order in  Council  of  13th May,  1901, under  the  ColonialBoundaries Act.
but only in the case of  offences against the laws of the provinces.  Though  bySection 91 of the British North America Act, 1867,  the Dominion Parliament hasan exclusive power of legislating with regard to criminal law and procedure in criminal matters, by Section 92 each province has the exclusive right of legislatingwith  respect to the  administration of justice  in the  provinces  including theconstitution, maintenance,  and  organisation  of provincial  courts  of criminal jurisdiction, and, with respect to the  imposition of punishment by fine, penalty,   f&apos;;or imprisonment, for the enforcing of any  law of the province made in relation toany  matter on which the province has power to legislate.   The powers of theGovernor-General and.of the Lieutenant-Governors are thus mutually exclusive.    3.  In Australia the position is different, because there is no reservation to theCommonwealth Parliament of the exclusive  right  of  legislation  with  regard  tocriminal law, which thus remains a matter for the constituent States., Hence, whilethe scope of the Governor-GeneraFs authority to pardon as set out in the Instructionsis precisely the same, mutatis mutandis, as that of the Governor-General of Canada,it is in practice very much more  restricted, inasmuch  as the offences against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of which he alone has power to pardon are few in number.  On the other hand, each of the State Governors exercises the prero-gative within the limits of his own State, the manner in which it is to  be exercisedbeing prescribed partly in the Letters  Patent  constituting the Officer  of governor and partly in the Instructions ;  these being substantially  the same within thoselimits as those of the Governor-General himself.    4.  The powers of the Governor-General of New Zealand are contained partly in the Letters Patent constituting his Office and partly in the Instructions and areto the same effect as in the case of Canada and the Commonwealth.    5.  In the case of the Union of South Africa, there  are certain differences.   Inthe first place/the Instructions permit it to be made a  condition of any pardon orremission of sentence that the offender shall be banished from  or shall  absenthimself from the Union,  unless he be a natural born  or  naturalised British subject.Secondly, in capital cases, though the Governor-General must consult his ExecutiveCouncil, yet he has to decide either to extend or to withhold a pardon or reprieveaccording to his own deliberate judgment, whether the members of the  ExecutiveCouncil concur therein or otherwise.   Lastly, there is no injunction to him in his instructions to take specially into his own personal consideration, in conjunctionwith the advice of the Executive Council,  any case in which a pardon or reprievemight directly affect Imperial interests or the  interests of any country or placebeyond the jurisdiction of the Government of  the Union.    6.  In Newfoundland the authority  delegated to the Governor partly by the letters Patent constituting his  Office  and partly by his Instructions is similar  tothat of the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, save that there is  no power to make banishment of an  alien a condition of the pardon or reprieve.    7.  In  the Irish Free State the Instructions are identical  with those in thecase of Canada.                    (4)-The Colonial Stock  Acts.1.  The Colonial Stock Act, 1900 (63 &amp; 64 Vic. c. 62), provides  [a) That a  Trustee  may,  under  the  powers of  the Trustee  Act,  1893       (56  &amp; 57  Vic.  c.  53),  invest  in  any  Colonial  Stock  which  is       registered in the United Kingdom in accordance with  the  provisions       of the Colonial Stock Acts,  1877 and  1892*  (40 &amp; 41 Vic.  c. 59, and       55 &amp;  56 Vic.  c. 35),  and  with respect  to  which there had  been       observed such conditions as the Treasury may by Order notify in the       London Gazette prescribed ;    * The Act of 1877 requires a register to be kept in the United Kingdom.   That of 1892 merelyrecognises transfer by Deed as well as transfer by inscription.
      (6) That the restrictions in Section 2 (2) of the Trustee Act, 1893, shall apply,           i.e., that a  Trustee may  not purchase,  at  a price over redemption            value, Stock with less than 15 years to run, or purchase Stock liable            to be redeemed at par or  other fixed rate at a  price exceeding 15 per            cent,  above par, or such other rate ,&quot;      (c) That the Treasury shall keep a list of any  Colonial Stocks in respect of            which the provisions of the Act are for the.time being complied with,            and shall publish it.        . ;     &apos;  , ::    2.  The conditions determined by the Treasury were laid down in  1900, S.R.and O. 1900 No. 926.  They are :-      (1) The Colony shall  provide by legislation  for  the payment out of the            revenues of the Colony of any sum  which may become payable to            Stockholders under any Judgment, Decree,  Rule, or Order  of a Court            in the United Kingdom ;      (2) The Colony shall satisfy the  Treasury that adequate funds (as and when            required) will be made available in the United  Kingdom to meet any            such Judgment, Decree, Rule, or Order ;      (3) The Colonial  Government shall place on record a formal expression of            their opinion that any Colonial legislation which appears to the Imperial            Government to alter any  of the provisions affecting the Stock to the            injury of the Stock holder, or to involve a departure from the original            contract in regard to  the  Stock, would properly be disallowed.

Proposed  Sub-ConferenceONMerchant Shipping  Legislation.Preparatory Memorandum on Existing Merchant            Shipping Legislation.
Confidential.3     1. The reference to the special Sub-Conference is :-           &quot; To consider and report on the principles which should govern in the      general interest,  the  practice and legislation relating to merchant shipping      in the various parts of the Empire, having regard to  the change in constitu-      tional status and general relations  which has occurred since existing laws      were enacted.&quot;     2. For the purpose of this inquiry a survey  has  been made of the existing acts with special reference to their application to His Majesty&apos;s dominions calling attention to what appear to be salient features of this legislation.                              The General  Position.     3. The general position is that the Constitutions of the various self-governingDominions give power to the Legislatures of those Dominions to legislate for thepeace, order, and good government of the Dominion.   This power, except whereextended by definite  Imperial enactment or by necessary implication, is confined to the territorial limits of the Dominions, including their territorial waters.  an example  of such an  exception is Section 5  of  the Commonwealth  of AustraliaConstitution Act, which provides that the laws of the  Commonwealth shall be inforce on all British ships whose first port of clearance and whose port of destinationare in the Commonwealth.     4. Further, attention should be called to the  provisions  of Section 2  of theColonial Laws Validity Act, 1865.     5. As regards merchant shipping legislation,  the  Merchant Shipping Acts,1894 to  1906, apply to a large extent to the whole of His Majesty&apos;s dominions andto all British ships.   This position, however,  is qualified by the terms of Sections735 and 736 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894  (the  Principal Act), which give to the Legislatures of British  Possessions certain powers of legislation with regardto merchant shipping.  By  Section 735 provision is made that any British Posses-sion  may repeal any  of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act (other thanthose of  Part III, which relate to  emigrant ships)  relating to ships registered inthat Possession.   It is to  be observed that this  power  may only be  exercisedsubject to confirmation by  His Majesty in Council, and that it is limited to shipsregistered in the Possession  concerned.   The question as to the  powers of theLegislature  of  a British Possession to legislate on these matters  after  it hasexercised its power to repeal the provisions of  the Principal Act under Section 735of that Act is a matter of some doubt.  One view is that the power to repeal givenby the Section necessarily implies a power to legislate, subject to the limitations andrestrictions imposed by the Section, and, if  this is the true view, then it would seemto follow that any such legislation would apply to vessels registered in the Posses-sion,  even when outside the territorial limits of the Possession.  The other view is that, once having exercised  the power to repeal given by Section 735, the Posses-sion&apos;s power to legislate is governed by the Constitution  of the Possession, andthat it is limited to the peace, order,  and good government of that Possession ;such legislation, therefore, would not have any extra-territorial effect.     By Section 736 provision is made that  any British Possession may,  on theconditions stated  therein (including equality of treatment of all  British ships),regulate its own coastal trade, but such power is likewise subject to the confirmation of the Act or Ordinance  concerned by His  Majesty in Council.     The Act of 1906 is an amending statute in pari materia with the PrincipalAct, and contains a provision that  it shall be construed as one therewith.     6. The general power of legislation, therefore, vested  in a Dominion Parlia-ment is-as follows : It can (subject to the limitations.mentioned above) legislate for the purposes of regulating its coasting  trade, and repeal any provisions of theMerchant Shipping Acts-.which.relate.to.vessels registered  in that Dominion.(C 14450) 250  12/28B2
                The  Provisions o  the Merchant Shipping Acts.     7.  Dealing now with the various parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894to 1906, the position  appears to be as follows :      Part I of  the Principal Act (amended by Sections 50 to  55, both inclusive,of the Act of 1906) which deals with ownership, registry, measurement for tonnage,nationality, and forfeiture to the Crown for certain offences, is specifically applied by Section 91 to the  whole of His Majesty&apos;s dominions and all places, where HisMajesty has jurisdiction.                                  n -     The question arises whether the power to repeal given by Section 735 applies to the provisions of Part I.   The view taken hitherto has been, that as registrationunder Part I is a condition which must be in existence  before Section 735 canoperate there can be no power under Section 735 to repeal Part I which contains the machinery for registration.     8.  Part II of the Principal Act, dealing with masters and seamen (as amended by Part III, dealing with seamen&apos;s food, Part IV, containing provisions as to relief and  repatriation of distressed  seamen  and seamen left behind abroad, and alsoSections 56 to 65, both inclusive, of the Act of 1906) applies in the manner set outin Sections 261 and 264 of the Act of 1894.   Section 261 provides that certain provisions relating to seamefrs wages,  the discharge of seamen, and similar matters^shall apply to all sea-going British ships except when the ship is within the juris-diction of the Government of the British  Possession in which it is registered, and section  264 gives power to adapt or  apply by local legislation any provisions ofPart  II which  do not otherwise apply to ships registered in that Possession, ortrading  with, or being at any port therein.   Where such provisions  have beenadapted or applied,  it  is provided that  they shall  have  effect throughout HisMajesty&apos;s dominions,  and in all places where His Majesty has jurisdiction, in thesame manner as if it&apos;were enacted in the Principal Act.  It is significant to notice that  by Section 265 provision is made that where there is any conflict of laws onthe subject-of  Part  II  the case is  to be governed  by the provisions of theImperial Act.    9. The provisions of Part III of the Principal Act (amended by Part II of theAct of 1906), which deal with  passenger and emigrant ships,  apply to all british ships, no matter where they are registered, subject to any contrary intention-inany particular section. The sections relating to emigrant ships cannot be repealedby Dominion legislation  as Section 735 definitely excludes such a power.   Thereason for this  is that the emigrant-ship provisions were originally enacted in the passengers Acts, and there was no provision in those Acts giving a power of repealto Legislatures in British Possessions.  The Passengers Acts were  amalgamatedwith the Merchant Shipping Acts by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 ;  and,as that Act was one of pure consolidation, it could not give a power of repeal not given by the original Act.   It should  be  mentioned, however, that in this Partof the Act as amended by Part  II of the Act of 1906 a passenger steamer is defined as one carrying passengers to  or  from any place or  between any places in theUnited Kingdom, and that Section 284 definitely sanctions the survey of passengersteamers in a British  Possession where  the local Legislature makes adequate pro-visions for granting efficient certificates and gives power to His Majesty by Orderin Council to declare that such certificates shall have effect as if granted underthe  Imperial Act, so that  such certificates and any conditions and  regulationsrelating thereto apply to the vessel extra-territorially.     10. Part IV of the Principal Act deals  with fishing boats,  and does not generally extend to oversea vessels, as by Section 372 it is provided that  Part IVshall not, except where otherwise  expressly provided,  apply to  any  BritishPossession.     .11.  Part V of the Principal Act (amended by Part I of the Act of 1906) dealswith safety, prevention of collisions, reports of accidents, etc., and applies, speaking generally, throughout the  Dominions,  though the provisions  in some cases are
limited to vessels leaving ports in the United Kingdom only.  Section 444 enables the Legislature of a British Possession to enact provisions as to load-line for shipsregistered there, which, if they are declared by Order in Council to be equivalentto the provisions in the Merchant Shipping Act, are deemed to have the same effect as though enacted in the principal Act.  Such legislation will have extra-territorialapplication by reason of the provisions of the Imperial Act and the Order in Councilthereunder.    12. Part VI deals with shipping inquiries and courts  and is somewhat in adifferent category from the other parts of the Act because provision is made bySection 478 for the Legislature of a British Possession  to authorise courts  or tri-tribunals to hold inquiries into  casualties occurring on or near  the coasts of suchPossessions or to vessels registered in those Possessions in cases where an investiga-tion or inquiry has not been commenced  in the United Kingdom.  This section,however, goes on to provide that the Board of Trade may order  a re-hearing  of anyinquiry held in a British Possession,  or failing such an Order, there  is a right ofappeal to the High Court in England except in  the case of vessels registered inthe Possession.   Moreover, the Board of Trade have power under Section 474 tore-issue and return a certificate of a master, etc.,  which has been  cancelled orsuspended in a British Possession.   Furthermore, by  Section 66 of the Act of1906, the right of appeal is extended to the owner of the ship or any other person who has an interest in the inquiry and has appeared and is affected by the decisionof the court.    Sections 480 to 485 of the Principal Act deal with the constitution and powersof &quot; naval courts &quot; ;  and, by Section 486,  these  provisions are&apos; made applicableto all ships registered in a British Possession, when those ships are out of the juris-diction of their respective Governments.    The powers of a naval court are extended by Section 67 of the Act  of 1906,which contains a provision that the section may be  applied by Order in Councilto any  British Possession the Legislature of which consents thereto.  By Section 68of that Act  any person aggrieved by an order of a naval court  forfeiting wages orby a decision of such court as to wages, fines,  or forfeitures  may appeal to a Divi-sional Court of the Probate,  Divorce and Admiralty Division  of the High  Courtof Justice in England who may confirm,  quash, or vary  the order  or  decisionappealed against.    13. Part VII, dealing with the delivery of goods, is limited in its applicationto the United Kingdom.    14. Part VIII,  which deals with the liability of shipowners, is extended bySection 509, unless the context otherwise  requires, to the whole of His Majesty&apos;sdominions.    15. Part IX provides machinery for dealing with wreck and salvage occurringon the coast of the United Kingdom.    16. Part X has  been repealed by the Pilotage Act,  1913, which  applies onlyto the  United Kingdom and the Isle  of Man.    17. Part XI deals  with  lighthouses,  and in the main  applies only to  light-houses on the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland ; but  provision is made bySection 670 and  the following sections for the collection of dues, etc., on certainlights erected at or near the coasts of any  British Possession,  the  expense ofmaintaining which are borne by the General Lighthouse Fund.    18. Part&apos; XII, which has been amended by the Merchant Shipping (MercantileMarine Fund) Act, 1898, deals with finance, and in the main applies  only to theUnited Kingdom.    19. Part XIII deals with legal proceedings ; and/ by  Sections 711 and 712,this Part of the Act, unless otherwise provided, applies to the whole of His Majesty&apos;sdominions.   Provision is made for difference of procedure in the courts of British
Possessions.   Certain of the provisions have the effect of conferring jurisdictionon the courts  of Colonial  Possessions in cases which would otherwise, by reasons of their extra-territorial  character,  not. fall within  such jurisdiction, e.g.,  bySection 684 an offence is deemed to be committed in the place in which the offendermay be; by Section 685 jurisdiction is given to the local court over ships lying offthe coasts ;  by Section 686 jurisdiction is given over any person found within thejurisdiction  of any court  in His  Majesty&apos;s dominions in respect of any offences committed by a British subject on board a British ship on the high seas or in any foreign port or harbour or  on board any foreign ship or whether by a British subjector a foreigner on board any British ship on the high seas ; by Section 687 offences committed by British seamen at foreign ports  are to be within the Admiraltyjurisdiction.   By Section 689 provision  is made for the conveyance  of Britishseamen to a British Possession to answer offences committed out of His Majesty&apos;sdominions.  The procedure for inquiry into  cause of death on.board a foreign-going British ship provided for by Section 690 is expressly excluded from applying to ships registered in  a British  Possession when within the jurisdiction  of theGovernment of that Possession.   By Section 691, when  a witness cannot be pro-duced, his deposition shall be admissible  in the.Court of any British Possession.By Section 699 (2) (b) fines recovered in any British Possession are to be paid overto the Public Treasury of that  Possession.  By  Section 711, offences  under theAct shall in any British Possession be punishable by any court or Magistrate  by whom like offences are ordinarily punishable or as may be determined by any act or Ordinance having  the force of law in that Possession.    20. Part XIV contains general provisions relating  to powers of administration and control, and includes  Sections 735 and 736 referred to in paragraph 4  above.The general superintendence  over  all shipping  matters  is vested in the  Boardof  Trade by  Section  713.   By  Section  723,   among  the  officers empoweredto see that the Act is complied with is included any Chief Officer of Customs inany place in His Majesty&apos;s dominions.  The exemption (by Section 731) of GeneralLighthouse Authorities (as defined in the Act) and the Board of Trade from rates,dues, and taxes appears  to extend  to all British Possessions,  although, on theother hand,  by Section 732 the express exemption from harbour dues only applies to the United Kingdom.  By  Section 734, power is given by Order in Council toapply  the provisions of  the  Merchant  Shipping Acts  to foreign  ships,  whichprovisions would accordingly fall to be recognised in  all British  Possessions.By Section 744,  while ships engaged in the  whale, seal, walrus or Newfoundlandcod fisheries are to be deemed foreign-going ships for the purposes of the Act, notfishing boats,  an exception is made  of ships engaged in the Newfoundland codfisheries belonging to ports in Canada or Newfoundland.  By Section 90 of the act of 1906, regulations may be  made by Order in Council  for the registration ofGovernment ships as British  ships ;  but nothing is to  affect the powers of theLegislature of any British Possession  to regulate  any Government ships under thecontrol of the Government of that Possession.              The  Principles  Underlying  the  Merchant Shipping Acts.     21. Looking at the Merchant Shipping Acts as a whole, with special referenceto their application to His Majesty&apos;s  Dominions and Colonies, the following broadpoints suggest themselves :      The Merchant Shipping Acts are  not a code in the ordinary sense of the term,but, a long series of Acts passed at intervals over a period of over 70 years.   Thefirst considerable Merchant Shipping Act, passed in 1854, was followed by a largenumber of amending Acts, which were all consolidated in 1894,  and the  Act of1894 has in its turn been amended by many subsequent Acts.   As might be expected the legislation deals only with those features of shipping which absolutely requiredstatutory, regulation at the time, and does not deal with these points in a uniformmanner, some being dealt  with in great detail, while on Others only broad principlesare laid down, the details  being left to be worked out in the form of regulations.     22. It has been pointed, out in preceding paragraphs that certain parts of theMerchant Shipping Acts, dealing with merely local matters, apply  only  to theUnited Kingdom ;  and the provisions relating to fishing boats, delivery of goods,
wreck and salvage, pilotage, lighthouses and the Mercantile Marine Fund, or itssuccessor  the General Lighthouse Fund, can be left out of consideration for thepurposes of the present memorandum.   There  remain those parts of the  Actswhich relate to registry, masters and seamen, safety of passenger and other ships,shipping inquiries and courts, liability of shipowners,  legal proceedings, and thesupplemental or general provisions, and in so far as these matters are concerned the Acts  treat  merchant  shipping  as an Imperial subject.   They  indicateendeavour to provide  on  an   Imperial  basis  for all contingencies  of  Britishmercantile navigation  throughout  the Empire,  partly by direct enactment andpartly by optional local  enactment (Sections 711, 735 and 736).    23. The  rules as to registry, nationality, and tonnage are  the  same for all.The provisions as to the rights of seamen and as to discipline on board ships applythroughout His Majesty&apos;s dominions, except when the  ship is within the jurisdic-tion of the Possession in which  it is registered.   The provisions as to safety are,speaking generally, applicable to British ships wherever they are.   The provisionsas.to wreck inquiries are of special interest, as the Acts devote a great deal  of attention to inquiries held in British Possessions.   Power is given to the Legislaturein a British Possession to authorise any court or tribunal to  deal with casualties to British ships (1) wherever they occur, if the ship is registered in the Possession ;(2) when the casualty occurs on  or near the coast of the Possession or on a voyageto it ;  (3) whenever witnesses are found in the  Possession.    24. These Courts of Inquiry, like Courts of Inquiry in the United Kingdom,are given  powers to cancel or suspend the certificates of masters and officers, but(a) they must  report to the Board  of Trade and send them the evidence ;  and(b) the Board of Trade  may either alter the sentence or order, a re-hearing, theobject  apparently being to secure uniformity of procedure and  some measure  ofco-ordination.    25. The  same anxiety to  secure  uniformity of procedure throughout HisMajesty&apos;s dominions is very marked in the provisions relating to legal proceedings.All courts throughout  His  Majesty&apos;s dominions  are given  jurisdiction to tryoffences (a) by  British subjects on British  ships on the high seas or in foreignports ;  (6) by foreigners on British ships on the high seas ;  if the person concerned is found within.the jurisdiction  of the court.    26. Offences against the Merchant  Shipping  Acts are  punishable  in  any british Possession by any court  by which an offence of like character is ordinarilypunishable, or as may be determined by local law.    27. Definite rules are laid  down  as to the punishment for  offences and thetime limit for summary proceedings ; also as to such matters as admissibility  ofevidence,  distress on ship, etc.   The object was clearly to secure that offencesarising on, or in connection with, British ships should  be dealt with in a uniformmanner throughout the Empire.   The whole  of  His Majesty&apos;s dominions  isregarded  as  one for these purposes and  there  is  a provision that when offencesare committed  by seamen on  a British  ship  out  of. His  Majesty &apos;s dominions or on the high  seas, a  Consul may send the offenders with the witnesses to the nearest convenient British  court (Section 689).    28. While considerable emphasis is thus laid on uniform principles and uniformprocedure, the Acts are very elastic  in their application to  British Possessions,and this to an extent which is surprising, considering the dates at which the  Actswere passed.    Section 735, which gives power to repeal the provisions of thePrincipal Act,  dates from 1854, and Section 736, which gives power to regulate the local  coasting trade, dates from  1869.    29. Throughout the Acts there occur provisos that certain provisions are notto apply  to  ships registered in a British Possession when they are  within  thatPossession ;  and a very great deal of care has  clearly been taken from an early stage in the legislation  to respect the position and rights of other Legislatures.
In recent years this tendency has been much more marked, and all the MerchantShipping Acts passed since 1910 are either expressly limited to ships registered in the United Kingdom and ships visiting the United Kingdom, or the self-governingDominions are  expressly  excluded from their operation.   For  instance,  the maritime Conventions Act, 1911,  applies  throughout  His  Majesty&apos;s dominions,except Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Newfoundland.   TheMerchant Shipping (Convention) Act, 1914, has the  same limitation,  India beingadded to the list.  The  British Ships (Transfer Restriction) Act,  1915, is similarlylimited.   The  Merchant Shipping (Wireless  Telegraphy)  Act,  1919,  applies to sea-going British ships registered in the United Kingdom, and to other ships only when they are within ports of the  United Kingdom.   The  Merchant Shipping(International Labour Conventions) Act, 1925, applies to vessels registered in theUnited  Kingdom ;  but there is power  to extend the application by Order inCouncil to ships registered in any British Possession  outside the  United kingdom other than India and His  Majesty&apos;s Dominions, including  the  Irish  Free State.The Merchant Shipping (Equivalent Provisions) Act, 1925, provides that, whereBritish ships registered outside the United Kingdom are required by their own law to comply with provisions  which are equally effective with the  provisions of theMerchant Shipping Acts applicable to  ships when they  are  within ports ofthe United Kingdom, an Order in Council may  direct that compliance with thelocal  law of  the  Possession shall  be accepted as compliance with the MerchantShipping Acts.December, 1928.
