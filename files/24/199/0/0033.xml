CONFIDENTIAL.                                             Copy  No,  28                     AriiRicAfM  NAVAL Wrtf?  r^fc^iosrirti.                               Ar  GIBRALTAR.CP. 383 (28)MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.     ON the 3rd October the United States Ambassador notified the Foreign Office by means of an official note that the American Battle Monuments Commission wished to erect in Gibraltar  a memorial to commemorate the war-time activities of the United States Navy in waters adjacent to that  fortress.  On the 17th October copies of Mr. Houghton&apos;s  note  were communicated to the Admiralty, War Office and Colonial Office with an intimation that, in view of the possibly unfortunate political repercussions  of any attempt to place  obstacles in the way of the American Battle Monuments Commission, an affirmative reply should be returned to the United States Ambassador.     The War  Office replied on the 14th November to the effect that the United States having played so small a part in the war, the proposed monument would be a subject for ridicule rather than respect.  On the 23rd November a letter was addressed to the War Office insisting that the reasons given in their letter could not be advanced as an  adequate ground for  refusing  the  facilities  sought by the  United  States Government; and on the same date Lord Cushendun wrote privately to the Secretary of War intimating that if the Army  Council persisted in their negative attitude he would take  the matter up  in the Cabinet.,     On the 20th November the Colonial of see forwarded a copy of a despatch from the Governor of Gibraltar, from which it appeared that  Sir Alexander Godley saw no objection to the proposed memorial, aad that he  had,  in fact, already discussed the matter informally with the Unitedd?tates Consul and  a representative of the American Battle Monuments Commission^ The Colonial Office stated that so far as they were  concerned &apos;they were  quite prepared  to acquiesce in  the American proposals.    A  reply was received  from  the Admiralty  on the 26th November, in which the undesirability  of erecting  an American monument in Gibraltar was emphasised on the ground that there is no memorial to the Royal Navy in that Colony.    I submit  that the American request cannot be refused without giving grossoffence  and needlessly embittering our relations.                                                                     A.  C.    Foreign Office, December 6,  1928.4680  [18573]                Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1928.
