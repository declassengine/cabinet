[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.                                            Copy No.    2 8CP.  364 (28).                     ANGLO-AMERICAN  RELATIONS.        MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR  OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER.     THE opening  and  closing sentences  of the Chancellor of  the  Exchequers memorandum (CP.  358 (28)) make scornful reference to  Mr. Craigie&apos;s paper  on Anglo-American relations (OP. 344 (28)), but the Cabinet will do well not to  be led away by the attractive vigour of Mr. ChurchiLVs literary style into supposing that he has demolished, or indeed weakened in any degree, the significance of the picture presented by Mr. Craigie of the existing situation  as between this country and the United  States.    With the greater part of Mr. Churchill&apos;s memorandum  I, for one, see no reason to disagree.  The policy he recommends in regard to naval  construction appears to me to be wise and sound, and none  of his colleagues is likely to differ from him  in deprecating  &quot; a  panic  mood in our relations with  the United  States,&quot; though differences of opinion might perhaps arise if a definition were offered of  the point at which prudence ends and panic begins.    But the  main contention of the  Chancellor of the  Exchequer is that no further negotiations  should  be  entered upon with  the United  States in  regard&apos; to  naval limitation until  Mr.  Coolidge goes out of  office next March.   This is the only point at which his observations impinge on those of Mr.  Craigie, and it should  be  noted that Mr,  Craigie does not strongly  urge  the opposite view.  It is a question that undoubtedly  deserves careful consideration;  but it would be unsafe to assume the correctness of the Chancellor of the Exchequers view that  we shall be in a better position to renew negotiations with Air. Hoover than with Mr..Coolidge.  We have not a great deal of  material for forming a judgment  on  this point,  but all the information possessed by the Foreign Office supports the opinion of Mr. Craigie thatwe shall find Mr. Hoover a  stiffer  proposition, than Mr. Coolidge.  Mr.  Craigie&apos;s reasons for thinking  that Mr. Coolidge might welcome the reopening of the question, and might prove not  unreasonable in  regard to it, are worth consideration.  .    But, however this latter question be decided, it leaves entirely  untouched mostof the problems discussed by  Mr. Craigie,  which cannot be solved by the Chancellorof the Exchequer^ pleasant  vision of &quot;jogging along quietly on our path.&quot;  Wemay,  indeed,  and  possibly  without  serious  disadvantage,  decline  response toMr. Coolidge&apos;s veiled invitation to reopen negotiations about naval  limitation; but does the Chancellor of the Exchequer suggest that we should similarly deal with thequestion of renewing our  arbitration treaty with America?  Again, it is only tooprobable that within the next few months, perhaps almost on the eve of  the general&apos;election, we shall have to reply to  an American  invitation to  a Conference onBelligerent Rights.   We  shall not get  rid of the embarrassment  which such an invitation would cause us by &quot;jogging along quietly on our path.&quot; Nor will thatspecific help us at Geneva, when the  Preparatory Committee meets early next  year,and when we shall not be able to escape discussion of naval disarmament round  a table at which an American representative will be seated among others.    These are the questions for the elucidation of which Mr. Craigie&apos;s able and well-informed  memorandum  offers assistance  to the Cabinet.   They cannot be  airilydisposed of by reminding ourselves, true though it be, that &quot; our day is not yet over &quot;;they need to  be thought out and the consequences of our action in-regard  to  themcarefully weighed.  In particular, they should, I submit, be weighed in relation tothe two entirely new factors  mentioned  in my note introducing Mr. Craigie&apos;smemorandum, and with the realisation  that these questions are going to have far greater influence in the  constituencies than the Chancellor of the Exchequer  seemsto suppose.                                                                          C.    November 24, 1928.4668   [18512]
