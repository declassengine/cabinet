DOMINIONS:            -&apos;   &apos;  CHANGES DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS 7              Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.IA detailed statement follows of the principal changes  &apos;&quot;that have taken place in each of the Self-Governing Dominionsduring the  last four years affecting the Customs Treatmentof British goods.     Broadly speaking it shows that  in Canada and even more in New Zealand the changes which have been effected havebeen to the advantage of British Trade.  In Australia on  theother hand duties have been increased on a number of british goods, In some cases, notably in the matter of woollenfabrics and hosiery, to an almost prohibitive extent,although the actual extent of the preference has -been on  thewhole maintained or even increased.  In the Irish Free Statewhilst preference has only been withdrawn in the case of  -sugar the policy of giving no preference on any new Customsduties, and. such have been numerous, has been consistentlypursued.  In South Africa there has  been a very greatshrinkage in the number of goods which enjoy preference,  thisIbeing now extended only to a limited number of articlesinstead of practically throughout the whole tariff, though in most cases  In which preference continues to be given theextent  of the preference has been  increased.  In thisDominion, however, a serious step has been  taken by theconclusion of  a Commercial Treaty with Germany (not yetratified) under which South Africa will be  precluded duringthe  currency of the Treaty from giving lower rates to any goods not at present enjoying preference without extending                                                     the
       the reductions also to Germany.            A table is annexed to this memorandum  (Annex  I)  showing       the distribution of the exports from  this country  to  each       Dominion to other parts of the Empire and to Foreign  Countries       in each of the last four years.   This statement  by itself       affords little evidence of tho effect of any of  the Tariff       changes referred to specifically  below  though  it indicates  a       tendency on the part of our  trade with  the  Irish Free State       to decline.  The figures of  our exports to  the Empire,       moreover, make a distinctly  good  showing when  taken in con-       junction with those of our exports  to foreign  countries.  The       Table which fcrms Annex II puts a somewhat  different  com-       plexion on the matter, as it shows  that in  four  out of the       five Dominions the proportion of  the  imports into  the Dominions       which is derived from this country  has  declined  during the       period under consideration.            The largest decline took place in  South Africa where the       imports from the United Kingdom were  nearly the  same  in value       in 1927 as in 1924 but represented  only 45.5 per cent., of the       total imports into the Union in the later year as  against 51.5       per cent,  in the earlier.                                               P. C-L.Board  of  Trade,    15th  December, 1928.
 Principal Tariff Changes  in each Dominion during the last Four Years,  affecting goods of  United Kingdom Production.                           CANADA.     The Customs Tariff of 1907  as  subsequently  amended  isin force.  The amendments  have been numerous  undersuccessive Budget Laws, several  of  which have made  provisionfor increased preference to certain classes of goods ofBritish origin.     In 1925 reductions of?&quot;duty  were made on  certain engines for fishing boats, well-drilling machinery  and certainagrisultural implements.     In accordance with the Canada-Australia  Trade  agreement which came into force on the 1st October, 1925,  severalarticles of food of Australian produce are  admitted intoSanada at rates of duty lower than those imposed under theBritish Preferential Tariff.     In 1926 the duties were reduoed on certain  agricultural and dairy machines, on motor cars and motor vehicles.  Rolledshsets of Iron or steel coated with tin of  a  class  orkind not manufactured in Canada were made free under theBritish Preferential Tariff,.     The Budget Resolutions of 1928 Introduced  many important changes in the Tariff.  The whole of the  TextileGroups, in the Tariff were  re-classified and re-arranged with almost Identical arrangements for each of the  Groups.Generally  speaking, this ^partial revision of  the Tariffappears to be of a character favourable to  British  tradewith the Dominion.  In  several instances the  scope  of  theBritish preference has been widened.  The principal changeseffected may be  summarised as follows:-
   got ton aThe preferential duties  on coarse  yams werelowered, and also those on a wide  range of household cottonsand on cotton blankets, cotton socks and shirts.   Woollens. Yarns for the weaving of woollen  or worstedfabrics were made free under the British PreferentialTariff when imported by manufacturers for&apos;-use  in their ownfactories.  Duties were reduced on some of the lighterweights of woollen fabrics, and on lustres and Italianlinings.  The rates on woollen socks were adjusted,  so thatthe more expensive lines pay higher rates, whilst  theduties on those socks more commonly In demand  are  lower.   Other Textiles. There were reductions In the preferential rates on certain of the finer grades  of linengoods.  A modification to which objection was  taken  bythe British jute yarn trade was the imposition of  a  dutyon jute yarn for use in the manufacture of twines.  Suchyarn was formerly free of duty.     The &quot;intermediate&quot; rates of duty in operation InCanada under the French Convention,  1922,, have been extended to several European countries during  the  presentyear,  and to this extent the value of the Britishpreference has been diminished.     The general conditions for the grant of preference have remained unchanged, but as from the 1st February,  1929, thepercentage of British labour and material required to  qualifygoods for entry under the ^British Preferential Tariff  willbe raised from 25 per cent, to 50  per cent, of the costof production of such goods.   It  Is understood that theDominion Government will be considering the revision ofthe regulations, but there is no information available atpresent as to the nature of the revision.  If  it takes the form, as in New Zealand, of permitting th.6 use ofscheduled foreign goods as materials without forfeiture of
the right to preference, the change may prove &quot;beneficial tobonafide manufacturers of British goods.   If there is nosuch qualification the result will probably be unffavourable .                      AUSTRALIA.     Proposals for extensive Tariff changes were placed before the Federal Parliament In September, 1925, and theAct embodying these was passed in July, 1926.   The mostimportant increases of duty were those on woollen fabrics,including cotton tweeds, (designed expressly to protectlocal woollen mills), on certain made-up textile goods,knitted apparel and underwear and woollen hosiery and products of the engineering industry.   &quot;Wool fabricsweighing more than 6% ounces per square yard and invoicedat not more than 3s.4d. per square yard were made subjectto a very heavy combined specific and ad valorem duty andthe same duty was applied to &quot;totton tweeds&quot; - fabricswhich Imitate the cheaper woollen suitings.   In theengineering section of the Tariff, the preferential rate ona large and important range of machinery was increased from27g to 45% ad valorem, and increased duties imposed on certain electrical goods.   There were, however, in thisrevision, a not inconsiderable number of instances of reductions of duty under the Preferential Tariff, and generally speaking, the amount of preference was maintainedor increased whenever the duties were altered.  Accordingto calculations by the  commonwealth. Minister of Trade and customs, this Tariff revision involved the accord of afurther  annual rebate of Customs duty in favour of thiscountry  of  500,000.    Judging, however, from the volume oicomplaints, these  changes were not  beneficial to the trade of the United Kingdom:   Indeed they were largely designedto protect Australian industry against British competition      A  further  envision of the Tariff was introduced inNovember,  1927.    Several branches  of United Kingdom trade                         3.
were accorded increased preference, accompanied in somecases by redactions of the British Preferential rates.On the other hand, the duties on seme important classes ofgoods of united Kingdom manufacture were increased, notablyiron and steel bars, and rods, rails and structural ironand steel.     During discussion of the Tariff Bill in the Senate afurther modification of the Tariff was adopted under whichthe heavy combined specific and ad valorem duty on the cheaper woollens, to which reference is made above, was extended to cover all woollen piece goods weighing morethan 6 ozs. per square yard irrespective of value.     An important modification of the Tariff in September,1927, increased the preference on British motor car chassis.     New preference conditions were enforced from 1st April,1925,   The percentage of United Kingdom labour and/ormaterial in the factory or works cost of goods entitled toentry under the British Preferential Tariff was rai sed from25^ to 75;&amp;, except in the case of those classes of goods which are not &quot;commercially manufactured&quot; in Australia, forwhich the former percentage of 25% was maintained.  However,preference is extended to goods &quot;wholly manufactured&quot; inthe united Kingdom, i.e. if in the raw materials used andalso in the finished goods, no manufacturing process hasbeen performed outside the United Kingdom which is beingcOiiiiiiercially performed in the United Kingdom.   In such casethe use of certain  scheduled raw materials is permitted(without regard to  origin) without  causing the goods to lose their character as &quot;--holly manufactured&quot; in the UnitedKingdom,   Except for a few difficult borderline cases, itis probable that  the new preference  conditions have beenbeneficial  bo British  Industry.
NEW ZEALAND.     Only -minor changes were made in the Tariff in 1925 and1926.  in September 1926, the level of British preferenceon motor oars, cycles, motor cycles and certain gas and oilengines was raised.     The Tariff at present in operation was Introduced in1927, its outstanding feature being the increased measureof preference accorded to many branches of British trade.     The margin of preference was increased from 15% ad valorem to 20% ad valorem on the following goods:-DraperyLinoleumsChinawareGlasswareStationeryC ine mat o graphsMusical InstrumentsEarthenwareFancy goods and toysSporting goodsMedical preparationsGramophonesLawn mowersProvisionsWoollen yarnsHosieryApparelMillineryHats and CapsWoollen piece goodsCordageElectric appliancesTobacco pipesPianosHardware and hollow-ware     An increase on the margin of preference from 10 percent, ad valorem to 20 per cent. ad valorem was accorded tothe following goodsr-C ha insElectric metersRecording instrumentsAxes, saws and toolsIndustrial machinesElectric cablesTypewritersEmery paperBolts and nutsFire enginesPrinting typeElectrical machineryKnitting machinesLensesOpticians&apos; materialsSurgical and Dental Instruments.     Special concessions were made in this Tariff to pieoegoods.  The class of cotton piece-goods which constitutes the bulk of New Zealand import trade in such goods,received an immediate increase of preference of 5 per cent.ad valorem, the new preference amounting to 15 per cent.ad valorem, such goods remaining duty free under the BritiahPreferential Tariff.  Piece-goods of other vegetabletextile fibres also received an immediate Increase of
1 ^X *J *Jpreference of 5 per cent, ad valorem, aa did also certainclasses of silk and artificial silk tissues.     From 1st July, 1928, all these piece-goods were madefree of duty under the British Preferential Tariff with a preference to 15 per cent, ad valorem.     Increased duties under the British Preferential Tariffwere confined to a comparatively small number of articles0     Revised regulations governing the application ofpreference  were enforced in How Zealand on the 1st April,1926,  The general effect of these regulations was toIncrease from 25 per cent0 to 50 per cento the proportionof Empire labour&apos; and/or material which must be containedin the factory or works cost of an article in order to qualify it for preferencej and also to confer preference inall cases on goods manufactured within the Empire, in whichall the manufacturing processes are performed within theEmpire from unmanufactured raw materials and/or from certainpartly manufactured raw materials, aa scheduled in theregulations,  Bo generous has bean the interpretation ofthese new regulations, that not only has British trade notsufferod but genuine British industry would appear to havebeen materially assisted,                  UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.     The present tariff  is that established by the TariffAct  of 1925, as modified  by amending Actsa     Under  the former  tariff, preference was  granted onpractically all goods  of  United Kingdom origin, suchpreference  taking  the  form, in nearly all  cases, of arebate  of  3/i ad valorem  from the duty prescribed in theTariff.     Iho  1925  Tariff  represented a radical modification  of the Union Tariff  system.   In  the majority  of  cases, the
preference was removed, the general idea being to accordpreference to a restricted list of goods in respect ofwhich preference would be of the greatest value to UnitedKingdom industries.     The United Kingdom was granted preference on tinnedfish, certain textiles, certain iron and steel and waresthereof, on certain machinery, some glass, white lead,rubber manufactures and newsprint paper.  The amount of thepreference was mostly 5% ad valorem^     A reduced list of preferences was at the same timeextended to Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  Most of thegoods accorded preference were already included in theUnited Kingdom list of preferences, and an Act of 1926extended to the United Kingdom all such preferences not previously accorded to the United Kingdom with the resultthat the United Kingdom obtained the Minimum duties forbinder twine, patent cereal foods and a few other goods.The accord of preferential rates to certain Australianproducts was withdrawn on 1st July, 1926.     The recently concluded Treaty between the Union andGermany (not yet ratified) is drawn in such terms that,whilst the existing preferences granted by the Union to theUnited Kingdom and other parts of the Empire are safeguarded,Germany will be able to claim for German goods any futureTariff preferences granted to Empire countries by way ofrebates of duty or application of the Minimum duties to goods from such countries.  The Treaty is remarkable inthat it is the first instance of a Dominion Governmentdeliberately giving up its right to freedom of action inregard to Imperial preference.                      IRISH FgEE STATS.     In 1925 duties were  imposed on blanketing, blanketsand rugs,  clothing and wearing apparel, bedsteads, wooden &apos;
furniture, and certain empty glass bottles,   Increasedduties were imposed on toilet soap, shaving  soap,  toiletsoap powder and toilet soap substitutes.  The duty on Sugarwas reduced and Empire preference on this article  withdrawn,The duties on tea, raw cocoa, coffee and chicory were abolished.     In 1926 a duty was imposed on oatmeal,  and on apparatusand parts and accessories for wireless telegraphy.  Theduties on wines and immature spirits neve amended.     In 1927, the duty on matches was amended.  New dutieswere Imposed on margarine and rosaries.     In 1928, the duty on motor cars was extended  to coverall motor vehicles, component parts and accessories.Formerly, commercial vehicles and tyres Y*rere exempt fromduty.     It should be noted that in the case of  all new duties imposed for protective purposes in the Irish Free  State,no Tariff preference is accorded to Empire goods.
