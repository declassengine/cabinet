Copy  No.   2 8CP. 368 (28).CABINET.THREE QUESTIONS OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE RELATED TO                ANGLO-AMERICAN  RELATIONS,          Note by the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence.          (CIRCULATED WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE PRIME MINISTER.)    THE attached summaries deal with three questions of Imperial Defence, all ofwhich  have some bearing on the political problem of Anglo-American Relations,viz. :        I.-The origin and present position of the decision to make no defensive            preparations against America as a possible enemy.     II.-The origin and reasons for the adoption of the one-Power standard for            naval construction.    III. The attitude adopted by the British Empire Delegation at the Washington            Conference towards the question of parity in cruiser construction.    2.   The summaries are prepared from material in the archives of the cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence.    3.   If the three subjects are considered together the result would seem to bethat, although hitherto we have not included the United  States among the nationsagainst which we test our defensive  preparations, partly  owing to the extremeimprobability and partly owing to the difficulties of such a war, nevertheless we havenever been willing to  fall below  the one-Power standard in naval strength,  whichwould weaken our position throughout the world.    4.   In regard to the numbers of Cruisers,our line at the Washington conference is shown to have been consistent with this general policy and with the line taken up at later Conferences.   The number  of Cruisers was to be determined not by thenumbers maintained by other Powers, but by the length and variety of our vital sea communications.   Owing  to the action of the French in rejecting the Washingtonproposals as regards Cruisers and Auxiliaries, we were able to avoid figuring as a principal  in the  breakdown  of the Washington  Conference on  this question,  butLord Balfour definitely stated our reserves on the question of Cruisers,  &amp;c, otherthan those required for the Fleet.

   I. The Origin and Present  Position of the Decision to make no Defensive               Preparations against America as a Possible Enemy.    1.  In the Memorandum on Anglo-American Relations circulated by the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper CP. 344 (28)) the remark is made that&quot;Except  as a figure of speech, war is not unthinkable between the two countries.&quot;The improbability of war with America has been a factor in the policy of this country.for a considerable number of years.  It  emerges in the first instance as a factor tobe taken into consideration only, and in the course of time it has developed almostinto  a cardinal principle.    2.  The first mention that can be traced in the records of the Committee ofImperial Defence is to be found as far back as 1904, when, in considering the defenceof various coaling stations, the Committee concluded          &apos;&apos; That in the event of war with the United States it is clear that the western    coaling stations could not be defended by the garrisons at present allotted to them    against organised expeditionary forces such as might be brought to bear if the    British Navy were not able to  be  employed  in full strength in the Western    Atlantic.&quot;And again, with particular reference to Bermuda          &quot;An  attack from  the United States need not be taken into consideration.    Only the possibility of a raid by cruisers of a European Power need be considered.    (C.I.D. 48th Meeting, page 2, July 8. 1904.)*    3.  A year  later, in considering the defence of Canada,  the Committee ofImperial.Defence concluded-         &quot;Having regard to the provisions of the Rush-Bagot Agreement and to    the susceptibilities of  the  United  States, the Admiralty  is not  prepared to    suggest any  measures of naval preparation which Canada could take with the    object of attempting to secure the  command of Lake Ontario in war.   They    consider, however, that the use of a torpedo flotilla .... with its bases fronting    the open sea, would not give the United States a reasonable cause for complaint.&quot;    (C.I.D. 75th Meeting, Conclusion 5 (3).)    4.  These two references seem to be pointers only, but from that time until to-day the United States of America have not been taken into- consideration in our defensive preparations.   Moreover,  within less than three  years these Conclusions were givenmore  definite interpretation.  For  in May 1908, when the question of warships onthe Great Lakes  was under consideration, Lord Morley expressed the view that theabove two conclusions, read in conjunction, should be taken      &quot; as a declaration of opinion that war with the United States was a contingency.    so remote that it might,  for defence purposes, be  neglected.&quot;  He observed     &quot;that, so far as he  was aware, nothing had recently happened to lead to a    modification of these conclusions,&quot;, and added : &quot;As regards the strategic aspect    of the question, it seemed to him that it wa,s futile for the Committee to discuss    what action we should take in the event of a war with the United States.  Apart    from the consideration of the remoteness of the contingency, it was clear that we     should not be able to defend the 3,000 miles of the Canadian Frontier in such    a war:&quot;With these views the Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith) concurred, and Sir Edward Grey(Foreign  Secretary) and Lord Tweedmouth expressed their agreement.  As a resultof this discussion the Committee concluded that they could &quot;see no reason to modify the conclusions arrived at on this question  at the 75th  Meeting on the 13th  July,1905,&quot; quoted above.   (C.I.D. 99th Meeting, May 14, 1908.)     5.  The next reference to  this question is to  be found in May  1911, at themeeting of  the Committee of Imperial Defence held in connection with the ImperialConference and attended by the Prime  Ministers  of the Dominions.  In the course    * NOTE. My own recollection is that this Conclusion was reached as the  result of an exhaustiveinquiry into the circumstances of a war with the United States, but that owing to the secrecy of the matterall papers were ordered to be destroyed.  As a subordinate officer of the Naval Intelligence Department, Iwas helping my Chief, and my recollections on the matter are quite clear. (Intd.)  M.  P. A, H.
of this meeting, Sir&apos;Edward Grey, in his review of foreign policy, after explaining the pacific character of our relations with the United States, continued as follows :         &apos;&apos; I trust the conclusion of an Arbitration  Treaty sooner or later will make    it clear to the whole world how very sure not only we, but the United States, are    that there can be no serious cause of trouble between the British Empire and the    United States.&quot;   (C.I.D. 111th Meeting,  pp.  13-14, May 26, 1911.)  .:And  again, later :--    entailed upon us any obligation to break that Arbitration Treaty and go to war    with the United States, even in the very improbable event of there being trouble    between the United States and Japan.   We have anticipated that point, and    have proposed to.the Japanese Government that when the alliance with them is    prolonged for another  10 years if it is prolonged it should be modified so as    to contain  an article stating definitely that the alliance shall not entail upon    us or upon Japan any  obligation to go to war  with a Power with which either    of us has a General Arbitration Treaty.&quot;  (C.I.D. 111th Meeting, p. 18.)    6.  At the next meeting of the Committee,  the Dominion Premiers still being present, the First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. McKenna), in dealing with co-opera-tion between the naval forces of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, referredto the relative naval strengths of the various Powers,  and observed: &quot;Now, fromSir Edward Grej^s statement the other  day,  it was perfectly obvious that we havenot to consider the United States navy as possibly hostile.&quot;  (C.I.D. 112th Meeting,P- 5.) \    7.  In the following year 1912 the Committee of Imperial Defence had underconsideration the strategic  position in the Mediterranean Sea; and in the course ofthe discussion the First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill) produced a diagramshowing  the position  in  comparative strengths of the next two strongest naval powers, namely, Germany and the United States.  Mr. Lloyd George then observed&quot; that the United States of America should be omitted from the argument; it wasnot serviceable to include them.&quot; And the Prime Minister  (Mr. Asquith) said &quot; thathe had expressly repudiated the reasonableness of including the United States as oneof the two Powers against which we had to build,  and in  that opinion Lord Fisherand the then Board of Admiralty had concurred.&quot;  Air. Churchill  said &quot;that he agreed that the United States might be eliminated.&quot;  (C.I.D. 117th Meeting, p. 2.)    8.  A week later a meeting was held which was attended by representatives ofthe Dominion of Canada,  including the Prime Minister  (Mr. Borden).   In  thecourse of the discussion,  Sir Edward Grey, in referring to the Arbitration treaty with Japan, explained that a condition had  been included that, in the event of a warbreaking out between the United States and Japan,&apos; Great Britain would  not be obliged to go to war against the  United States, and  that that condition had beenaccepted by Japan.  He added that &quot; the Japanese  were very ready to accept it (thecondition above) because they had not the least intention of  picking a quarrel withthe United States, and because they realised  perfectly well that the public opinion,not only of the United Kingdom, but of the  Empire,  being what it is, it would beimpossible for the British Empire to go to war on the side of Japan against a nationlike the United States, with which we are on such  excellent  terms, and with whichwe have so many close ties.&quot;   (C.I.D. 118th Meeting,  pp. 4  and 5.)    9.  Two years later, in May 1914, the Committee of Imperial Defence had underconsideration the probable scales of attack against Oversea British Ports.   ThePrime Minister (Mr. Asquith), in opening the discussion,  said     &quot;that some of the questions on.which the Overseas  Defence  Committee were    asking for an authoritative opinion  were hypothetical and involved questions of    high policy,  and that he doubted whether the  Committee could  reply to them;    although, in some cases, such as that regarding the need  for taking into account    the attack that might be brought  to bear by the United States against  the    British Islands in the  West Atlantic, the probabilities were so obvious that it    might be possible to do so.....   He reminded  the  Committee that in 1908,    when they were considering the question of  warships  on the Great  Lakes,    Lord Morley had pointed out that he regarded two previous conclusions which[18521]B 2
     had been arrived at by the Committee as a declaration of opinion that a war     with the United States was a contingency so remote that it might for  defence     purposes be neglected, and that so far as he, Lord Morley, was aware, nothing     had happened to lead to a modification  of  the conclusions  referred to.   He     himself had at the time expressed agreement with Lord Morley.&quot; As a result of this discussion the Committee concluded          &quot; In considering the question of the defence of the British Islands in  the     West  Atlantic, there is no need to take  into account the scales of attack that     may  be brought to bear  against  the Islands by  the United  States,  but  the     defences should be sufficient to resist any scale of  attack  that can be regarded     as reasonably probable in the event of a war with a European Power,  and on     broad grounds of  prestige,  as well as for political reasons,  the  garrisons of     Bermuda and Jamaica should be maintained at their present strength.&apos;5 Later on in the same discussion Mr. Harcourt (Secretary of State for the Colonies), in dealing with the Panama Canal      &quot; pointed out that the opening of the Canal would be of considerable importance     to the United States, in that it would enable that Power to transfer ships of war     from the Atlantic to the Pacific, or vice versa.  Since,  however, the contingency     of a war between Great Britain and the United States was not to be taken into     account, the opening of the Canal would only affect us in so far as a war with a     European Power was concerned.&quot;  (C.I.D.  126th Meeting, Minute 5, May  14,     1914.)     10.  During the Great War, in spite of the difficulties which arose with the United States of America, the  War Committee never gave  consideration to the possibility of a rupture of relations. As stated by Lord  Grey, our policy was      &quot; to secure the  maximum of blockade that could  be enforced without a rupture     with the United States.&quot;  (Lord Grey, &quot; Twenty-five Years,&quot; Vol. II, p.  103.)     11.  The next  reference  to  this  question occurs after the Great  War,  at a Meeting of the Commitee of Imperial Defence held in December 1920 to consider the question of  Naval  Shipbuilding  Policy.  On  this  occasion  the  Prime  Minister (Mr. Lloyd George) made a long statement regarding the risks of naval competition with the United States, in the course of which he said      &apos;&apos; that before the late war the Committee of Imperial Defence had considered     most carefully, with the expert advisers of the Admiralty and the War Office,     the possibility  of the rupture of  friendly relations with the United States of     America, and it had been unanimously decided, in calculating our defensive     preparations, not to take it into consideration.  The grounds for this conclusion     were equally applicable to-day as they were when the decision was taken, viz.,     that we could not fight the United States for economical as well as for military     reasons.....&quot;             .     &apos;.12.  At the  Imperial Conference in  1921, Mr. Hughes  (Prime  Minister  of Australia),  in speaking of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance,  said :.          &quot; It may be laid down as a sine qua nan that any future treat)?- with  Japan,     to be satisfactory  to Australia, must specifically exclude the possibility  of a     war with the United  States of America &quot;; And later on, at the same meeting          &apos;&apos; War with  America is unthinkable.   As the  contingency  is  quite  an     impossible one  it need not be seriously considered.&quot; At the same meeting  Mr. Lloyd  George said:          &quot;It is quite axiomatic here, not merely with Governments  but  with the     people, that we must never quarrel with the United  States.   It  is one of the     things which we regard as quite inconceivable.&quot;     13.  In January, 1928, the Committee of Imperial Defence, in considering the question of South African coast defences, invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to  give his  opinion on the probable  development of the political  situation during the  next few years.   In the Report of the Committee  of Imperial Defence
on this subject (Paper No.  309-C) Sir Austen Chamberlain is reported to have informed  the Committee  that      &apos;&apos; a direct quarrel with  the United States may be regarded as something that     neither side would contemplate though a  danger might possibly  arise  if,  in     a  war with a third Power  a naval blockade were instituted which caused     inconvenience, to United States trade.  Such a war with a third Power the     Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regards as very unlikely at any rate for     some  years.  He therefore suggested that the Committee of Imperial Defence     might safely assume that  no great war was  likely to occur during the next    ten years.&quot;    14.  In May of the same year, during a discussion at the Committee of ImperialDefence on Naval Policy,  Sir Austen Chamberlain repeated what he had said whenthe question of South African coast defences were under consideration, namely :         &quot; That a direct quarrel with the United States might be regarded as  some-    thing that neither side would contemplate, though a danger might possibly arise    if, in  a war with a third Power, our action as belligerents caused inconvenience    to  United States trade.   Obviously, however, our attitude as regards belligerent    rights would at any time be conditioned by what the United States  might be    expected  to  stand.   He suggested that if America made our  attitude  on    belligerent rights a casus belli we should not be able to afford to risk hostilities    Avith her and would  have to give way.  It would indeed not even be necessary    for the United States to take any  warlike action against us in protest.   They    could  close markets and financial sources  of vital importance  to  us.  Such  a    situation, he reiterated, Avas, in his opinion, the only one from which a war with    America might arise, but he  could not imagine that any British  Government    Avould be mad enough  to create such a position.&quot;    (C.I.D.  236th  Meeting,    Minute 6, July 5, 1928.)    15.  In  a Memorandum dated  the 5th April, 1928, prepared  by  the ForeignOffice for  the use of the Committee of  Chiefs of Staff, attention Avas drawn to the bad effect  on Anglo-American relations of the failure to achieve agreement on thequestion of naval disarmament.  The passage concludes on a comparatively hopefulnote  as follows :         &quot; The situation has certain analogies Avith that existing as betAveen  Great    Britain and Germany before the Avar, and for this reason needs careful watching.     But there are also certain fundamental differences, chief of Avhich is the fact     that the American people is,  as a Avhole, pacific in its- outlook.   In the  Avords    of Admiral. Rodgers, United States of America, &apos; the United States is peaceably     and benevolently, although somewhat  arrogantly, disposed towards the  rest of    the world.&apos;&quot; (C.I.D. 899-B.)     16.   In  their Third  Annual  Review  of Imperial Defence  Policy, which was approved  by  the  Committee of Imperial Defence at the 238th Meeting,  held on the8th November, 1928,  the Chiefs of Staff Report made the folloAving reference to thissubject:         &quot; 9. First, there is the principle stated by the Foreign Secretary as recently     as the 8th February, 1928, in  the House of  Commons, &apos; that  preparations  for a     war with the United States has never been  and never will be the basis of our     policy in anything.&apos;*        In order to remove all possible risk of misunderstanding on the subject, we     Avish  it to be clearly  understood that, although, in fixing the world standards     of naval power, the numerical strength of our capital ships and aircraft carriers     is, under the provisions of the  Washington Treaty, laid down on tire basis of     equality with the fleet of. the United States, nevertheless, at the present time     (as for many years past) AA?e entirely ignore that country in our defensive  plans     and preparations.  Should it ever be necessary to take the United States of     America into account in  our strategical preparations, considerable developments     and modifications would be necessary in our defensive arrangements,  which     Avould require years to bring  into effective operation.  It is essential that any     signs of a possible change in the political horizon vis-a-vis the United States of     America should therefore be brought to notice immediately, and we suggest that     the special  attention of the  Foreign  Office should  be directed  towards this.     possibility and its complications.&quot;        * This appears to be the first public reference to the decision governing the question..
    17. . The net results of the above is that since 1904 we have not included theUnited States among the nations against whom we make defensive.preparations.                        II. The One-Power Standard.    In  his  Note covering  the Foreign Office  Memorandum  on Anglo-american relations (Paper OP.  344  (28)) the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsmentions the Prime Ministers declaration that we do not intend to build ships in competition with the  United States.  This  raises the  question  of the One-PowerStandard, and it is thought that it would  be useful to recall previous discussions and decisions on this subject in order to show what was meant by the adoption ofthat basis for our naval shipbuilding policy.;                &apos;    2.  The policy of the One-Power Standard seems to have been first formulated in a Memorandum by the Admiralty dated the 13th February, 1920.  After severaldiscussions  at the Cabinet and  the  Finance Committee  the First  Lord of theAdmiralty announced  the policy on  the 17th March in the following terms :-         &apos;&apos; I  believe it is a fact that the naval policies of all past Governments,    whichever Party they represented, have at least included this common  principle,    that our Navy should not be inferior in strength to the Navy of other Powers,    and to this principle the present Government firmly adheres.  ...  That is the    foundation of the  naval policy of His Majesty&apos;s  Government.  This is not a    policy for the Admiralty;  this is a matter for the Government;  and this is the    policy which we have deliberately adopted, and I at least think it is a policy   . which will commend itself to the House of Commons and the  country.&quot;  (C.I.D.    Paper N. 1.)    3.  Between June and December 1920 three very  important discussions tookplace  at the Committee of Imperial Defence on the subject of our naval shipbuildingpolicy.  At the third, of these meetings the  policy of the One-Power Standard was confirmed, as shown by the following extract : -         &quot;LORD BEATTY, proceeding, enquired  whether the  Governments naval    policy remained the same that is to say, were the Admiralty to work on a one-    Power standard ?        THE PRIME MINISTER  replied that he was in agreement with the one-Power    standard, and no alteration had been made in the Governments policy.        MR. BONAR LAW expressed the opinion that this should be so, and said that    although it might be called a  one-Power standard it might be much more.        MR. CHURCHILL said that he had not at first been disposed to agree with the    First Sea Lord when the  latter had suggested as  a basis &apos; equality with the    United  States of  America in regard  to the number of big  units.&apos;   He had,    however, now come round to Lord Beatty&apos;s views.&quot;        (Minutes of the 135th Meeting held on December 23, 1920.)    4.  The policy of the One-Power Standard was formally adopted by the ImperialConference, 1921, in the following Resolution        &quot; That, while  recognising the necessity of co-operation among the various    portions of the Empire to provide such naval defence as may prove to be essential    to security,  and, while holding that equality. with  the naval strength of any    other Power is a  minimum standard for that purpose, this  Conference  is  of    opinion that the method and  expense of such co-operation are matters for the    final  determination  of the  several, Parliaments  concerned, and  that any    recommendations thereon should be deferred until after the coming Conference    on Disarmament.&quot;                                    .    5.  On the 1st November, 1921 (Cabinet 83 (28), Conclusion 2 (&amp;).), the Cabinet,in approving the instructions, that had been drawn up for the British delegation at the Washington Conference, laid down that they were to adhere to the one-Powerstandard.                 &apos;     .  .                &apos;    . ,    ,    6.  Early in 1922 a Cabinet Committee was appointed, under the chairmanship of Mr.  Churchill, to examine.  Part  I of the Report of  the  Geddes Committee on
  National Expenditure.  Their Report  (Paper  CP. 3692) contains the following;.  extract :-          &quot; 11. From the close of the Napoleonic wars to the beginning of the present      century, it might be said that the British Navy was not only the strongest Navy      in the world, but was stronger than all the other Navies put together.  Towards      the  end of  this period we were guided by the two-Power standard, i.e., the      British Navy able to fight, with reasonable  prospects of success, a combination      of the two  next strongest Naval  Powers.   In 1912, in face of the German      menace,  we adopted the 60 per cent, standard over Germany  alone to regulate      the new construction of Capital ships,  and the general scale of the Fleets in      being, and we also adhered to the 100 per cent, standard in cruisers.  In fact,      however, our strength more nearly approached  80 per cent, superiority  in the      line of battle.  This superiority against Germany far more than covered the      potential case of America,  and, having regard to the conditions of distance, we      considered that the British pre-war Navy was, in fact, at a standard equal to      that of  Germany  and  the United States combined,  i.e., that  it  would not      necessarily have been destroyed by naval means even by that combination. Far .  ;,  different is the position in  which we find ourselves after the great victories of   \, the late war.   We have abandoned all idea of  naval supremacy, hitherto the     foundation of our  greatness, and have  consented to a  position of bare equality     with the United States.  Such an equality in strength is no equality in situation,     for the United States  is entirely self-contained and  independent of a Navy,     while we are dependent for four-fifths of our food  supplies on  oversea markets.     To this melancholy result of the one-Power standard we have  been reduced by    , force of circumstances.  We must rely upon  preserving the good relations now     established with the United States and the continuance of a long peace, during     which their naval effort will perhaps wane.         12.  We  think it,  however, indispensable that the  one-Potver  standard     should be genuinely maintained.  By this we do not mean that the British and     United States Navies should be exactly matched in every particular,  or  that a     fair allowance Should not be made in estimating personnel for the great reserves     which these  Islands possess in their seafaring population.-   But we  consider     that, not only in our own judgment but in that  of foreign nations, the standard     at which the  British Navy is maintained should not  be definitely inferior to that     of  the United States.   Any such condition  of inferiority would undoubtedly     affect our whole position and influence in the world,  and  indicate to our   -&apos;  Dominions that a new centre had been created for the Anglo-Saxon- world.  We     have felt  that the Cabinet,  and indeed  Parliament, would expect us to regard     the maintenance of.the  one-Power standard as  an imperative condition.&quot;  1     7.  When this Report came before the Cabinet, Mr. Churchill,  as Chairman ofthe  Committee,  made  an  important statement,  which  included  the  following passage :          &quot; He  believed  that if  the  Admiralty  were  pressed to  make  further     reductions, the Naval Members of the Board would carry out the instructions of     the Government, but they would be compelled to say that they were inconsistent     with the maintenance of the one-Power standard.  If it became widely known     that we  had abandoned the  one-Power  standard our diplomatic   position     throughout the world would be weakened and it would indicate to the Dominions     that a new centre had been  created  for the Anglo-Saxon world.&quot;                        (Cabinet 9 (22), Conclusion 2.)     8.  The one-Power  standard was again reaffirmed by the Imperial Conferenceof 1923  in the following passage  :         &quot; Subject to this provision,, the Conference suggests the following as guiding    principles :                          &apos; &apos;          &apos;    :     *           *           *           *          *           *        (d.) The  desirability of  the maintenance  of a minimum standard  of naval              strength, namely, equality with the naval strength  of any foreign              Power, in accordance, with the provisions of  the Washington Treaty              on Limitation of Armament  as approved by Great  Britain, all the              Self-governing Dominions and India.&quot;    9.  The whole  of  the  Resolutions,  of which the above forms a part,  werereaffirmed at the Imperial Conference, 1926.
III. The Attitude of the British Empire Delegation at the Washington Conference             towards the Question of Parity in Cruiser Construction.    In  the  Memorandum on  Anglo-American Relations circulated by the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper CP. 344 (28)) it is mentioned that&apos;&apos; Americans believe that &apos; parity&apos; was  conceded in principle at Washington  in1922.&quot;  The same statement has been made from time to time in British newspapers.The facts are given below.    2.  The preparations for the Washington Conference were remitted by theCabinet to what was then known as the Standing Defence Sub-Committee of the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence,  working under the Chairmanship of Lord Baifour.  Tothis Committee the Admiralty, on the 5th October, 1921, submitted a memorandum which included the following remarks bearing on the question of Cruiser tonnage :          &quot;First and foremost, it is perhaps unnecessary  to state that no scheme    should be countenanced which would in any way jeopardise the naval security    of the British Empire or endanger the safety of our sea communications.....    No opportunity should be lost of maintaining the incontrovertible fact that the    naval needs  of  the  British Empire, extending to every ocean, are infinitely    greater than those of any  other nation, and that, although the Government has    accepted a position of equality in naval strength with the United States, this is    a concession to which their naval needs do  not really entitle them.&quot;    3.  The Standing Defence Sub-Committee in their Report, which was approvedby the Cabinet at its meeting on the 1st November, 1921, as the basis for the british delegation^ instructions, included the following statement:          &apos;&apos; As a result of a comprehensive examination of all the available methods    of naval disarmament,  the  Admiralty have come to the conclusion, - and have    satisfied the Committee, that the only method which is sufficiently simple to be    really practicable is  an international agreement as to the  limitation  of the    number of  capital ships.&quot;    4.  Beyond this general instruction  regarding the desirability of confining theinternational agreement to capital ships,  thus by implication excluding Cruisers, theBritish Delegation to the Washington  Conference received no specific instructions onthe subject of Cruisers.    5.  The printed proposals  presented  at  the first Plenary Meeting of theWashington Conference by Mr. Hughes, lumped together under the general heading of  &quot;Auxiliary  surface combatant craft,&quot; Cruisers (exclusive  of  Battle  Cruisers),Flotilla  Leaders and Destroyers, and  included a  proposal that the  total tonnageallowed to each Power should be as follows :-                                                            Tons.             For the United States   ...       ...      ...     450,000             For Great Britain       ...       ...      ...     450,000             For Japan     ...    -   ...       ...      ...     270,000This,  it will be  noticed, is an application to these classes of the 5-5-3 ratio adopted for Capital Ships.    6.  Before Lord Baifour made his reply, the American proposals were anxiouslydiscussed by  the British Empire Delegation at Washington. At the  first meeting,held on  the 13th November,  1921, the British Empire  Delegation had before them aMemorandum by the Admiralty  Section which contained  the following passagerelating to Cruisers :-         &quot;It is certain that the British  Delegation will have the sympathy  of the    conference  when they state that to no Nation is the safety of its sea communication-    tions to any extent comparable with the safety of its sea communications to the    British  Empire.        One portion alone, viz,, the United Kingdom, is so dependent on the free use    of the seas&apos; that starvation would follow  six weeks&apos;   deprivation  of the sea    routes to its ports.        It is difficult for a great self-contained country  like  the United States,    independent for any  of its vital necessities upon outside  resources,  to realise    the absolute  dependence  of  an  island empire  upon the safety  of its sea
    communications :  living as we do by the sea and on the sea, the safety of the    sea is an integral necessity of the common safety of all our scattered territories.    The foregoing consideration must be borne in mind in regard to the few remarks    I  propose to make upon  the less  important portions of  the  United  States    proposals which refer to auxiliary combatant craft.         The British Delegation are in general agreement with the proposals of the    United States  for  the limitation, in similar proportions  to those upon which    agreement may be reached for capital ship strength, of those classes of vessels    which  are complementary  to  the battle fleet and which are employed  with it    in an auxiliary capacity.         Remarks will be offered in committee upon the methods to be employed in    calculating the numbers of those vessels which are  required for work with the    fleet.         In order,  however, to  afford reasonable  safety to  the  extensive  sea    communications of the British Empire in all portions of the globe, a number of    cruisers  and auxiliary  merchant cruisers  are  essential,  over  and above  the    proportion agreed upon for use with the fleet.         The adequate protection of these sea routes necessitates a dispersion of force    out of all proportion to  the numbers which can be concentrated to attack these    routes, and it must be realised that the provision of these ships  is a purely    defensive requirement, involving no hint of offence such as  is conveyed by the    battle  fleet and its satellites,  but merely representing  a national insurance of    vital interests.         These numbers are not considered to be essential to any international scheme    for the reduction in armaments, which must be  based mainly on the relative    strength in capital ships, which by universal agreement form the basis of sea    power  at the present time, and  therefore  the measure  of a nation&apos;s power of    aggression.&quot;                                                    .    7.   The  British Empire Delegation approved the  draft of a telegram whichwas sent the same day  by Lord Balfour to the  Prime Minister,  which summarisedLord Beatty&apos;s views and included the following :          &apos;&apos;  As regards cruisers  and  other  auxiliary vessels, Lord  Beatty  accepts    proportion in paragraph 14, so far as concerns those classes of auxiliary vessels    which  are complementary to the  battle  fleet, but he  insists that, over and above    these,  British Empire requires other cruisers for protection of communications.          -ifr          -it?                                  Ap,          ,y.          &quot;7V*          TV           -7f-           -JV&quot;           ^          rfc         Views expressed by Lord Beatty were fully discussed and generally accepted    by British Empire  Delegation.  With their concurrence  I propose  to give a    warm  welcome  in principle to American proposals and  definitely to accept their    plan as regards numbers of capital ships.   At the same time I shall emphasize    widespread and special  responsibilities of British Navy, and, without dwelling    on points of detail, I shall indicate that certain aspects of  the scheme  require    further examination and that  the scheme should be referred to a commission.&quot;    8.   Lord Balfour made his  statement to  the  Second  Plenary Session on the15th November, 1921, at 11 A.M. HOW closely he adhered to the line proposed in his telegram of the I3th November is  shown by the  following extracts :          &quot; Now, I said I would explain, if I was allowed, why I venture to rise first    to-day, to deal with the subject which  is in all oui hearts.  As I have hinted,    it is because the British Empire and Great Britain, the two together, are more    profoundly concerned with all that touches matters naval  than it  is possible    for any other nation to be,  and this not, believe me, for any reasons of ambition,    not for any reasons drawn from history or  tradition, but from the hard brutal    necessities of plain and obvious facts.         There never has been in the history of the world a great Empire constituted    as the British Empire is.  It  is a fact  no doubt familiar to  everybody whom I    am addressing  at the present moment, but has everybody whom I  am addressing    imaginatively conceived precisely what the situation of the British Empire is    in this connection ?       [18521]                                                         c
         Most of my audience are citizens of the United States.  The United States     stands solid, impregnable, self-sufficient, all its lines of communication protected,     doubly  protected,  completely protected, from any conceivable hostile. attack.         It  is not merely that you are 110,000,000 population; it is not merely that     you are the wealthiest country in the world; it is that the whole configuration     of your country, the geographical position of your country, is such that you are     wholly  immune from the particular perils to which, from the nature of the case,     the British Empire is subject.         Supposing, for example, -that your western  States, for whose  safety you     are responsible, were suddenly removed 10,000 miles  across the sea.  Supposing     that you found that the very heart of your  Empire, the very heart of this great     State, was a smalland crowded island depending upon oversea trade not merely,     not chiefly, for its luxuries, but depending  upon oversea communication for the     raw material of those manufactures by which its  superabundant  population     lives; depending upon the same oversea communication for the food upon which     they subsist. Supposing it was a familiar thought in yourminds that there never     was at  any moment of the year within the limits of your State more  than seven     weeks&apos;  food for the population, and that food had to be replenished by oversea     communication.  Then, if you will draw that picture,  and if you will see all that     it implies and all that it carries with it, you will understand why it is that every     citizen  of  the British Empire, whether he be drawn from the  far  Dominions     of the Pacific or whether  he lives  in  the small island  in the North  Sea,  never     can forget that it is by sea communication that he lives, and that without sea     communication he and the Empire to which he belongs  would perish.         Now, ladies and gentlemen, do not suppose  that I am uttering laments over    the weakness of  my  country.   Far from  it.  We are strong, I hope, in the    vigorous life of its constituent parts. We are strong, I hope,  in the ardent     patriotism which binds us all together.  But this  strategic weakness is obvious    to everybody who reflects;  it is present in the minds of our enemies,  if we have    enemies.  Do not let it be forgotten by our friends.          M,           vii-           AJ.           -Af,           JC.           M.          &quot;Tl        j -  &quot;7Y*           &quot;TV&quot;     -.&apos;     &quot;TV&quot;        -  TV           &quot;7V        Taking those two as really belonging to one subject, namely, the battle fleet,    taking  these two, the battleships themselves  and the vessels  auxiliary and    necessary to a battle fleet, we think that  the proportion between the  various    countries is acceptable; we think the limitation of amounts is reasonable;  we    think it should be accepted.  (Applause.)   We firmly believe that  it  will be    accepted.                                                        -?          *        .   *           *           *           *           *        However, there may be other questions of detail, questions connected with    replacement, questions connected with cruisers which  are. not connected with    or required for fleet  action.  But  those are matters for  consideration by the    technical experts, and however they be decided, they do not: touch the main outline    of the structure which the United States Government desire erected,  and which    we  earnestly wish to help them in erecting.  (Applause.) &quot;     9.  At  a  meeting  of  the British  Empire  Delegation  on the  same afternoon(i.e., the 15th November, 1921) Senator Pearce, of Australia, raised in  particular the bearing on the position  of the Australian  fleet of the question of cruisers and auxiliary  vessels  over and above the ships required  as complementary to the battlefleet. Lord Beatty repeated his previous thesis  in the  following terms : -         &quot;Admiral of the Fleet  Lord  Beatty  explained&quot;that the  Naval Staff had     carefully considered the essentialneed of stationing cruisers and auxiliary vessels     abroad  for protection of Imperial communications, and that these must be over     and above the numbers required for the service of the main fleet.  It was most     important, therefore,  to insist on a &apos; ration &apos; of auxiliary vessels over and above     those required for the main fleets; otherwise, if  cruisers  were confined to the     numbers required  for a battle fleet, we should be  at a disadvantage with  other     navies.   The United States fleet, for example, would be  able to keep its fleet con-     centrated, all its auxiliaries being constantly with the battle fleet, which would     be continuously trained as a single unit, whereas a large  proportion .of our     auxiliaries would be scattered over the world.&quot;
     10.  Iri the meanwhile the American proposals at  the &quot;Washington conference were being  studied at home by  the Standing Defence Sub-Committee  under theChairmanship of Mr. Churchill.   At a meeting on the 14th November,  before the considered views of the Admiralty had been received, the Committee reached, inter alia, the following Conclusion in  regard to cruisers:      ;    &quot;(/.) The Admiralty are making an examination in detail of the position     as regards cruisers and auxiliary vessels; but the Committee consider that the    number of British cruisers must be based not upon the number of cruisers main-     tained by other Powers, but upon the length and variety of the  sea communica-    tions over which food and other  vital supplies for the United Kingdom must be    transported.&quot;     11.  The whole of  the Conclusions of the Committee, including  the above, weretelegraphed to Lord Balfour on the 16th November, and  therefore did not reach himunti] after he had made his statement at the Plenary Session quoted above.    12.  The  Admiralty Memorandum  on  the  American proposals,  dated  the21st November,  was in full accord  with the Conclusions  of the Committee, and developed at considerable length  the reasons which necessitated a large number of cruisers for the protection of our lines of communication.  (C.I.D. Paper No. 285-B.)    13.  At a meeting  of the  British Empire Delegation  at  Washington on  the28th November         &quot; Lord  Lee also pointed out that  the question of  cruisers could not  be    ignored, and proposed the limitation of size to 10,000 tons; also that the same    ratio, 5-5-3, should apply to cruisers as for the  Battle Fleet,  with a full    allowance over and above this for the British Empire trade routes.&quot;    14.  As the result of this meeting Lord Balfour sent  a telegram home whichrepeated his  intention to  accept the 5-5-3 ratio for the number of cruisers requiredfor fleet purposes     &quot; provided our claim is admitted to a substantial surplus for the defence of the    Empire trade routes.&quot;This attitude was endorsed by a telegram sent by the Prime Minister  after a meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 1st December, 1921.    15.  It will be noticed that  by  this time the British Empire  Delegation was definitely committed to a policy of demanding a ration  of  cruisers  over and abovethe proportions of 5-5-3  which Lord Balfour had already accepted  for those whichaccompany, and are part of, the battle fleet.   Lord Balfour had given a hint of this in his speech at the Second Plenary Conference, but had hot  yet had occasion todevelop the full  position.   He was saved from this by the  attitude  of the French;for, at a meeting of the  Sub-Committee of Fifteen on Naval Limitation  (of whichall the Heads of Delegations were members), a letter was  read from M. Briand which included the following :         &quot; But so far as  the defensive ships  are concerned (light cruisers, torpedo    boats and submarines), it would be  impossible for the French Government,    without putting itself in contradiction with the vote of the Chambers,  to accept    reductions corresponding to those which we accept for capital ships under this    formal reserve,  which you will certainly understand.        The idea which  dominates the Washington Conference is to restrict naval    armaments,  which are offensive and costly. But I do not believe that it is  the    programme to deny to a nation like France, which has  a large extent  of coasts    and a great number of distant colonies, the  essential means of defending its    communications and  its security.&quot;    16.  In  his commentary,  the Chairman, Mr.  Hughes,  after  welcoming  theFrench acceptance of the ratio for capital ships, continued as follows :         &quot; He explained that M. Briand went on to say that it would be impossible,    without running counter to the vote of his Parliament, to accept a corresponding    reduction in the purely defensive branches of the navy, that is  to say,  in light    cruisers,  destroyers, submarines, &amp;c,  and,  therefore,  M.  Briand  formally    entered a reservation on this point while  consenting  to the allowance of capital    ships.&quot;
    17.  After Admiral de Bon had further developed the French attitude, LordBaifour made a statement, which includes the following very important passage :          &quot;Next he came to the question on which he desired a clear understanding.    As he understood the letter of M. Briand which the Chairman was good enough    to read to them, it assented to  the American  scheme regarding capital ships,    while making specific reserves as to auxiliary craft, light cruisers, torpedo boats    and  submarines.   That  seemed to be  entirely  satisfactory.   That was  the    position occu/pied by the British Empire Delegation.  They  had come  to  a    provisioned agreement ivith the American Delegation and the Japanese Delega-    tion as to capital ships. They had done so with a reserve as to auxiliary craft.&quot;    18.  It should be noted,  however, that Lord Baifour then reasserted that theBritish  Empire   Delegation   &quot;held  very  strongly  that  there  should  be  nosubmarines  . .  .  .&quot;    19.  The Washington Treaty as eventually signed and  ratified  contains no reference to cruisers beyond disallowing the construction  of any warships greaterthan 10,000 tons or with heavier guns than 8-inch, except capital ships and aircraft carriers,  which were provided  for in  the earlier clauses.-    20.  From the above  it is clear-    (i.)  That at  Washington we did accept parity  for capital  ships, aircraft           carriers and cruisers and auxiliary vessels working with the fleet,  but          we could not accept it as regards other vessels of the cruiser and auxiliary           classes for the reason that, under the tonnage limitation of the American           proposals, we could not have provided the  numbers of ships required for           trade  protection.   Our difficulty (as  at later  Conferences) was  not so          much  in  regard to the principle of parity as in squaring it with  the          tonnage limitations of the American proposals.    (ii.)  That it  never became necessary  for Lord  Baifour  to develop the full           position or to face  a breakdown over this question owing to the fact that           M. Briand anticipated him by making  a very definite reserve on behalf           of France, but that on this occasion Lord Baifour definitely  stated the           British Empire Delegation^ reservation  in regard to auxiliary  craft,           light cruisers and torpedo craft, and said  in so many words that he had           accepted  the capital ship agreement &quot;with a reserve  as to  auxiliary           craft.&quot;    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,         November 27, 1928.o
