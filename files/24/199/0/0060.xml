Foreign Office, December 18, 1928.                                     (!.-)                 Telegram  to His Majesty&apos;&apos;s  Minister, Peking.(No. 363.)                                 Foreign Office, November 24, 1928.    YOUR telegram No. 1159 of 18th October :  Boxer indemnity.    1.   Question of unconditional remission of Indemnity is still unsettled and will come up before the Cabinet shortly.  It has, however, been approved by availablemembers of Advisory Committee, subject to indication to the Chinese Governmentthat committee&apos;s original  recommendation  had  been unanimously  in  favour ofdevoting bulk of the  funds to  educational and other cultural  purposes.   Theyconsider that accumulated  deposits  should &quot;also  eventually be  unconditionallyremitted.    2.   Unpaid balance can, as stated in my telegram No. 256,  be  dealt with by resolution in  the House of Commons.  Accumulated deposits may present greater difficulty, as they are controlled by an Act of Parliament.  We can either, as hitherto contemplated, pass an Amending Bill, but it is practically certain that this cannotbe done before the General Election.  Or we can proceed to deal with it under the1925 Act.  For this purpose a sub-committee would be necessary in China to advise the Advisory  Committee here, who Avould in turn advise the Secretary of State, bywhose  act  the  money would  then be allocated.   The members  composing  this sub-committee, a majority of whom, it is suggested,  should be Chinese,  might be selected after consultation with the Chinese Government.  As we are now dealingwith a  lump  sum and not with  a series of annual payments, allocation could beeffected once  and for  all, i.e., the total sum  could be split up among so  many      4695   [18634]
a                                      (2.)    Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Peking. (Received November 29.)(No. 1393.)                                         Peking, November 28, 1928.    YOUR telegram No. 363, last paragraph.    I anticipate that Nanking Government will be only too ready to agree to any terms within reason we might attach to unconditional surrender, though naturallyI cannot guarantee that they or their successors would adhere to them.    If that policy is formally approved I suggest the best thing to work for  wouldbe voluntary declaration by  Chinese of their  intention to apply recommendationof the Advisory Committee (Command Paper 2726)  in its entirety plus undertaking to place such orders as might arise thereunder, railway  construction, conservancywork, &amp;c, in Great Britain.    Until  I  have been  able personally to sound the ground at Nanking I cannotpredict possibilities, but I think we should be able to get the above or something likeit.  I agree that if this policy is adopted we should cease to have any form of controlof funds.   Such control would, in my opinion, be ineffectual in any case,  and in all probability merely lead to continuous friction.    Oddly enough  Dr.  Wang has just written from Nanking suggesting that we might take up indemnity question, and I had  replied prior to the receipt of yourtelegram expressing readiness to do so as soon as possible (see my despatch No.  1456),and to-day V.  K. Ting raised the  question verbally.   I always find it difficult onthese occasions to explain away now delay&apos;in passing amending Act.    May I know as soon as the Cabinet have decided, and  also how far I may safelygo in my conversations if I go South ?                                      (30              Telegram to His Mujesty&apos;s Consul-General, Nanking.(No. 3.)                                      Foreign Office, December 4, 1928.  .  FOLLOWING for Sir M. Lampson :-         &quot;Your telegram  No. 1393 of 28th November, Boxer indemnity, does not    answer question in last sentence of my telegram No. 363.         &quot; It appears impossible to deal with paid deposits except by an amending  ;  Bill.  As&apos;regards that portion of  the fund, therefore; delay is inevitable, and    pending legislation&apos; I cannot make an absolutely categorical statement of; our  .  intentions regarding funds now accumulated in the bank.   - ;   :  ;   .    -  :         &quot;Question of unpaid balance will be decided by the Cabinet on Wednesday.  t....... -.   &quot;Does above consideration modify your recommendation in paragraph 2 of    your telegram under reference? &quot;     ;   . -&quot;  &apos;        ;   -  ;  -   fr ;  -   -&apos;Auniversities or institutions.  The sub-committee&apos;s responsibility could either cease assoon as the lump sum had been allocated or it could continue to exercise administra-tive  responsibility,.  The latter alternative seems undesirable,, as it would, protractour statutory control over funds which we cannot  control effectively without givingoffence to the Chinese.                                                           yv     3.  We are faced by difficulty owing to the accidental separation  and differencewhich have grown up between the paid and unpaid balances.  Tt is  impossible to treat the two in  exactly  the  same  way.   This imposes  a certain amount ofawkwardness on our gesture such as might, if we are: not careful, spoil  the wholeeffect.  Please telegraph your observations on the above, together with any alternative suggestions.  If we were to declare willingness to  remit unpaid balance, will we be forced by circumstances simultaneously to declare our intentions regarding the paiddeposits ?
   Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Minister (at Nanking).-^-(Received December d,),(No. 48.)                                          Nanking, December 9, 1928.    YOUR telegram No. 3.    I regret omission.  The answer to the question in your telegram No. 363 is &quot; notnecessarily, provided I may explain the position fully.&quot;    Recommendation in  my telegram No. 1393 stands, though I realise it may bedifficult of application  in its entirety, seeing  that the  1925 Act, which governsaccumulated deposits, does not cover later recommendations of Advisory Committee.But I believe that this should be possible of solution with Chinese goodwill.       i    (Repeated to Peking.)

Lampson :-         &apos;&apos; My telegram No. 3 of 4th December :  China indemnity.         &quot; No conclusion having been arrived at, it is unlikely that an early decision    can be communicated to you,&quot;                                      (6.)  Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Minister (at Nanking). (Received December 10.)(No. 51.  Private.)                                Nanking, Decermfier, 10, 1928.    YOUR telegram No. 9.    I am sorry, for I had hoped to use this indirectly to get us out of some of our many difficulties, customs for instance,  as might have been possible.  Also, it  would haveshown in striking and practical  fashion that we are very much in earnest in our desire  to help  them  stabilise  their position.  It is a moment when some suchoutstanding act would go straight home; in addition, we should have been well quitof a further prospect  of entanglement.   We already have quite enough to carry.

Foreign Office, December 6,  1928.    YOUR telegram No. 1393 of  28th November : Boxer indemnity.    Following plea on behalf of Hong Kong University has been  received from secretary of State for the Colonies.   Please telegraph observations :           &quot; It  has been suggested  that accumulated deposits might be used for the    assistance of Hong Kong University.  These funds would enable the University    to become, as it was originally intended  that it  should, a great centre of both    Chinese studies and Western education for the  Chinese.  Its proper develop-    ment has so far been prevented by  lack of funds.   It is urged that there, can    be no question that this  is an object of mutual benefit to Great Britain and    China, especially  when, the help given by the Chinese, official and unofficial, in    the-foundation and maintenance of the university is remembered,  and that if    the unpaid balance is surrendered unconditionally, such  assistance to the  Hong    Kong University  is the only way of ensuring that some part qf the indemnity    shall be  devoted  to the improvement of  education  in China.   The  secure    establishment of the University would, it is argued, at  the same time enhance    our prestige and influence both how and permanently, far, more effectually than
a gesture of generosity which would only too soon be forgotten.  It is hopedthat it might also have the same effect in encouraging British trade as Americaninfluenced education has in encouraging American trade.  I should be glad if sir M. Lampson could be asked to telegraph his views, particularly as to theeffect  announcement of this allocation of accumulated deposits, coupled withannouncement of surrender of future payments would have on Chinese opinion.&quot;  &apos;;&apos;         .                          .......  Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Minister (at Nanking). (Received December 10.)(No. 50.)                                         Nanking 6 December 10, 1928.    YOUR telegram No. 373 to Peking.    To my regret I can only state my conviction that effect would be bad.  It wouldbe regarded as going back on our plighted word, delay in fulfilling which is alreadycausing criticism which is not easy to meet now that China is practically united.  Ishall certainly be  pressed on this,  and should welcome arguments with which to convince the Chinese tnat delay in passing amending Act is unavoidable.    (Repeated to Peking.)o
