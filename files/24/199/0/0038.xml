IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT) / ^     Any programme of Government assistance to the distressed areas which may be announced before Christmas should,  I think,Include a special provision for the feeding of school  children in those areas,   A good deal of feeding is now going  on underthe Board&apos;s ordinary Regulations, but in certain areas where such feeding is oertalnly needed, no steps have been taken bythe Local Authorities.   This is particularly the case in Durhamwhere, I think, there is grave cause for anxiety.   The time has, I think, come when we should make a special grant to certain                                                      -of the most distressed areas which will relieve the rates of practically the whole cost of feeding.   These grants  could be given on condition?7; which would ensure proper administration under medicalinspection,     I propose, therefore, that, as an alternative to  the existingpercentage grant, we should offer a capitation grant equivalent to3d. per day per child feda   This arrangement should be temporary.The best term!McManus ad quern would probably be next October whenthe rating position In the distressed areas will be relieved by thene w Ex che ru er gr ant s .     It is difficult to give an exact estimate of the  probable costof this proposal.    If 10 per cent of all the children, on the registerin the geographical  counties of Glamorganshire, Monmouthshire,Durham, and Northumberland received food, the cost would be about 300,000,   The cost of giving tSie same amount of feeding under the  .existing Regulations would be between  150,000 and  200,000.   Ishould regard this as an outside estimate,*d of Education, S.Vf.1.           (Intd. )  E,P.  11th December, 1928.
