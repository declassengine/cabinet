(C.I.D. Paper No. 162-A.)       (Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 231st Meeting, Minute 2.)     THE  COMMITTEE  had under consideration the Fourth Annual Report  of the  Sub-Committee on Air Raids Precautions (C.I.D. Paper No. 162-A), for the discussion of which the following had been invited to attend the meeting :-              The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,             The Secretary of State for Scotland,             The President of the Board of Trade,             The Minister of Health.             The Minister of Transport.     SIR JOHN ANDERSON stated that the Report was mainly concerned with the  organisation which should be  adopted  to deal  with anti-aircraft protection measures.  The enquiries of his Sub-Committee had progressed sufficiently to enable an estimate to be formed of the amount of detailed work which required to be done before it could  be  considered that we were in  a state of readiness to meet the contingency contemplated.  The  details of  the  various  schemes involved would necessitate a large  amount of work falling on the civil Departments, who, unlike the fighting Services, were not provided with any organisation to work out plans  to meet a possible future war.  In the circumstances it had occurred to his Committee that the kind of organisation which had been created to deal with industrial unrest might be adopted with such modifications as were necessary to deal with the situation which would arise in the event of air attack.   In brief, the Committee recommended that, while responsibility for drafting the necessary schemes should be decentralised to the Departments concerned, the detailed work in regard to these schemes should be centralised within the Department, either under the head of the Department or some special officer deputed for the purpose.   Otherwise there was danger  that the work of preparation would not receive the attention it deserved and progress would be unduly  slow.   It was further suggested that the activities of the various Departments  should be co-ordinated by an official  Committee  composed of  the representatives in each Department to whom responsibility  had been definitely allotted; while, in order to secure the necessary &quot;decisions in regard to questions of policy, a ministerial Committee was proposed consisting of the Ministers in charge of the Departments mainly concerned.   The Report also pointed out that  in some cases it might be necessary to engage additional staff to work out the necessary schemes, and emphasised that, in order to secure continuity, an adequate Secretariat was essential.     SIR MAURICE HANK.EY reported to the Prime Minister that the Ministerof Health had intimated that  he was in agreement with the Report.      [18606-5]

THE PRIME MINISTER, having ascertained that no objections were enter-tained by  the  Ministers  concerned to the proposals contained in the  Report,expressed the view that the Report was an admirable one and reflected great credit on the Air  Raids Precautions Committee.  He suggested that  the Report should besubmitted to the Cabinet.                                CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a.)  To approve the Fourth Annual Report  of the Air Raids Precautions           Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 162-A).    (b.)  To recommend  that the Report should be submitted for  consideration by           the Cabinet.

REPORT.     1.   OUR Third Annual Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 156-A) was approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence at its 231st Meeting* held on the 19th December, 1927.           -     2.   During the past year advantage has been taken  of the  approval of the Committee  of  Imperial  Defence and  Cabinet  to  consult in  confidence  various authorities outside Government circles.  The Departments and Sub-Committees con- cerned with the preparation of the schemes enumerated in  our first report  (C.I.D. Paper No. 135-A) have thus been enabled to carry their work a stage further and to secure some of the information and assistance which they require.  &quot;We are  keeping in touch with the progress of this  work in its  various  aspects.  Plaving  regard, however, to the wide field covered by our terms of reference, and to the facfthat all the personnel employed have  other duties and  engagements of more immediate importance to attend to, it will  be  appreciated  that some  considerable time must elapse before all  the requisite schemes  can be  drafted and co-ordinated with  one another and a comprehensive plan submitted for approval.     3.  In particular, during the past year we  have had under consideration the question of the &quot; decontamination &quot; of streets and houses after gas attack. It is not necessary at this stage to report in  any detail on this aspect of our work; it will suffice to state that our examination has led us to the conclusion that the work of &quot;decontamination&quot; should be undertaken by  the various Local Authorities.   We recommend, therefore, that the departmental responsibility  for this work should be vested in the Ministry of Health, and not in the Home Office,  as indicated in our first report.    4.  We intimated in our last report that we  proposed to consider the nature of the central organisation,  which should be set up to deal with all matters pertaining to the protection  of  the civil population and the maintenance of the nation&apos;s vital activities in the event of air attack.    5.  It will be remembered that  in our first report (C.I.D.  Paper No.  135-A) we included a schedule showing, in tabular form,  under a heading for each Depart- ment of State, the action for which we recommended that each Department should be held responsible.  We pointed  out at the time  that the list did not purport to be exhaustive, and would probably need to be enlarged and modified as a more detailed examination of the problem was  conducted.   The Committee of Imperial Defence will  remember that at their 204th Meeting, held on the 29th October, 1925, they approved this report and authorised &quot; the Departments to carry out  the investiga- tions and preparations recommended therein.....&quot;    6.  Enquiries based on this schedule, with certain modifications with which it is not necessary to trouble the Committee of Imperial Defence, have been proceeding since the above date, and our experience of these enquiries has confirmed the view on which we proceeded in recommending the allocation of responsibilities to existing Departments, rather than the establishment of a special ad hoc body to deal with the whole problem.    7.  We feel that this principle  of utilising existing machinery and  resources should be followed also in the event of actual hostilities.  It will be appreciated that many of  the measures which it will be necessary  to put into force in such circum-stances are intimately related to,  and closely bound up with, certain normal peace- time functions which will have to be continued whether there be a state of  war ornot.   To attempt  suddenly  to divorce the purely war-time responsibilities  of the half-dozen Departments concerned from these peace-time activities which must be continued during war would, we  feel sure, lead to much duplication of effort, and inevitably to considerable confusion.                           * C.I.D. 231st Meeting-, Minute 2.      [18455]                                                       B2
       8.  We strongly recommend, therefore, that responsibility should rest with the   appropriate Departments for all executive action in respect of measures which it may   be necessary to take in the event of air attack on this country.       9.  We do not, however, blind ourselves to the fact that,  in the stress of the   crisis, there may be a popular demand for a special Ministry to deal with every aspect   of the problem of protecting  the civil population and maintaining the nation&apos;s   activities, and  that it may be politically expedient to comply with this demand, in   spite of its practical disadvantages.  Should such a set of conditions arise and the   establishment of a special Ministry become inevitable, the necessary reorganisation   would be  facilitated, and could be effected with the minimum  of inconvenience,  if   arrangements  had  already been  made  within each Department concerned to con-   concentrate under one responsible head all the war-time functions, so far as anti-aircraft   services were concerned, of that Department.       10.  This brings us to the consideration of another aspect of the problem.  The   course which  we  have  advocated above  involves,  so far as  executive  action  is   concerned,  decentralisation  to  the  appropriate  Departments,  combined  with   centralisation  within those Departments.  But all the measures necessary to meet   the conditions resultant upon air attack must be in harmony with  one another, must   be,  in  fact, integral  parts of a  single scheme.   It will avail nothing to have  a   well-organised  and efficient  system to maintain  London&apos;s food supply,  if its   inhabitants are allowed to stream out in panic to starve in the  provinces; it would   serve no purpose to have an elaborate scheme for the treatment  of casualties, if the   means  of  conveying them to  hospital break down  or the roads  are   rendered   impassable through  lack of repair facilities or inadequate means of dealing with   concentrations  of poison gas.   Decentralisation, in so far  as  executive action is   concerned, must therefore be accompanied by machinery for co-ordination of policy   and for. consultation in regard to plans.       11.  So far as policy is concerned, the ultimate decision on major issues must   rest with whatever body is charged  with  the supreme control  of the war, which,   presumably, in the case under consideration, where this country is ex hypothesi, being   subjected to air attack on a large scale, will either be a Cabinet or will take  the form   of a special War Cabinet.  But, in the circumstances, there will be from day to day   many  matters of minor importance requiring decisions of policy,  which will affect   more than one Department  of State.   For this purpose we recommend the establish-   ment of a  Committee consisting of the Ministers in control of  the Departments   concerned,  under the chairmanship  of  one of the Ministers serving  on  the War   Cabinet or other body charged with the supreme direction of the War.  We suggest   that the composition of this Ministerial  Committee should  be  : The Secretary of   State for Home Affairs, the Secretary of State for  Scotland, the  President of the   Board of Trade, the Minister of  Health, the Minister of Transport, together with   an expert to be nominated by the Chief of the Air Staff.       12.   In regard to plans, it appears to us that a parallel case  is to be found in   the arrangements, which have been adopted between the three Fighting Services, for   a similar purpose, viz., the creation of the  Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.  We   understand that, while each Chief of  Staff  remains responsible to his own Board of   Council in respect of matters affecting his own Service, the three Chiefs of Staff are   jointly charged with the responsibility of examining into, and tendering advice on,   matters  which concern all three Services or Imperial Defence as a whole.  In like   manner we think that a  Sub-Committee should be set up to examine into, and tender   advice on, all matters concerning  what may  be described as air raids precautions7   services.       13.   It would  be the duty of this Sub-Committee to ensure  that the actions   proposed by any one Department were in harmony with  the  general scheme of   protection and did not run counter to or vitiate the actions of any other Department.   In matters of policy, beyond their competence, they would seek the decisions of the   Ministerial Committee referred to above, and they would leave all executive action   to be taken by the Departments concerned.   The Committee  would be composed of   the representatives of each  Department  under whose direction the  activities of that   Department in relation  to air raids precautions had been centralised, together with   appropriate representatives of the Service Departments, and should, we  consider,
sit under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State of the HomeOffice, as being the Department primarily concerned.    14.  To sum up, we recommend that in time of war the organisation shouldbe:-    (a.)  A Ministerial Committee,  composed of the  Ministers of the Departments          concerned, under the chairmanship of a member of the body charged with          the supreme control of  the War, to co-ordinate questions of  policy;          assisted by    (&amp;.)  An official  Committee,  composed of the representatives of the Departments          concerned, under whose directions air raids precautions services have been          centralised, together with  appropriate  representatives of the  Pighting          Services,  under  the  chairmanship of the  permanent head of the Home          Office, to co-ordinate plans,and that executive action should be  left in the hands  of the Departments concerned,which should be  so organised as to  centralise all work in connection with air raids precautions services under one individual.    15.  By this means the needs of the situation should be adequately met, over-lapping and waste of effort should  be  avoided, and,  should the establishment of aspecial Ministry  become expedient politically, the necessary reorganisation could beeffected with the  minimum of confusion and delay.    16.  It is now necessary to consider what organisation should be set up  in timeof peace.    17.  In this connection it  must be borne in mind that the attack which it  isrequired to guard against  is one which may in certain circumstances be  deliveredimmediately on  the outbreak  of hostilities.   No time need  elapse  between thedeclaration of war and the delivery of the first blow, and, what is more important,this blow may be directed against  national  interests and activities, which in thepast have lain comparatively immune from attack, behind the shelter of the country&apos;sarmed forces.    18.  The organisation which we have outlined above  must, therefore, be readyto be put into action immediately the necessity  for.it arises and should be in activeworking operation in time  of peace.    19.  Further, if national interests are to be given the greatest possible measureof protection, schemes  must be  worked out  in peace  time and a definite plan,embracing every aspect  of  the problem involved, must be  prepared and kept readyagainst the day  when it may be needed.   In fact, the  advent of air  warfare has created the necessity for having in each of the Departments of State concerned a&quot; planning &quot; section.  In other  words, a &quot; civil General Staff &quot; must be brought into being.    20.  By this we do not wish to  imply that there  is any need at the present timeto set up a separate  and  additional section in each Department for this purpose.  all we have  in mind is that the time has now arrived when the work in each department in connection with  air  raids precautions  should be organised  in  such a  manner as to bring it under the  immediate direction  of one  individual preferably thepermanent head of  the Department or one of his Deputies.   It may so happen  thatin some cases some additional staff may be required, possibly as a temporary-measure for the purpose  of some particular  enquiry.  But, as it  is a matter for the Depart-ments concerned, we do not wish to  make any specific recommendation on this point,beyond expressing the hope that, where a case for additional  assistance is made out,it will receive favourable consideration by the Treasury.    21.  In effect,  therefore, we recommend that  the organisation which we havesuggested  above as requisite in time of  war, i.e., a  Ministerial Committee, anofficial Committee and the centralisation under one  individual in each Departmentof all work in connection with air raids precautions, should be set up at once.
    22.  In this way we hope to ensure that, since the organisation necessary in warwill already have been in operation in time of peace, the transfer from peace to war conditions will be effected with the least dislocation and the minimum of delay; andthat, so far as is possible under our existing system of Government, those who have drawn up and approved the plans will be responsible for putting them into executionwhen the need arises.    23.  We  put forward these proposals fully realising that  the organisationoutlined is open to serious criticism  in two respects.  By its nature the personnelemployed must of  necessity be fluctuating, particularly in so far as the Ministerialelement is concerned, and, further, the personnel will only be able to devote a part and that a residual part- of  their time and energy to  the study of war plans.  Intime of war their  anti-aircraft duties will be their main preoccupation;  but in timeof peace, when individuals have responsibilities and duties to discharge in respect of current affairs, preparations against a contingency which may not arise for a numberof years will inevitably be put aside and  only accorded  such attention as the sparetime of the individual may permit.  Yet, unless there is steady and continual progressin the study and preparation  of schemes,  and in keeping them up to date once theyhave been prepared, serious deficiencies will be found to exist if and when the daycomes to put these schemes to  the test, and the organisation which  we have outlinedwill have failed.    24.  These defects can only be remedied by  the provision of an efficient and active secretariat, whose duty it will be  to ensure that progress  is not allowed tolanguish, that the  whole plan  is not jeopardised, because one particular element hasbeen neglected, and that the reactions of the several parts of the plan on one anotherare not overlooked. In fact, we must look  primarily to the Secretariat to provide the impetus and supply the continuity, wdiich must of necessity be lacking  in the rest ofthe organisation.   We venture to commend this consideration to the special attentionof the Committee  of Imperial Defence.
