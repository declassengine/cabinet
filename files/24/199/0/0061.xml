History and Results of Existing Preferences in                        the British Tariff.(Circulated with reference to Cabinet 53 (28), Conclusion 8, and CP. 391 (28).)       NOTE BY THE BOARD OF CUSTOMS  AND  EXCISE.                              (A.) HISTORICAL.    THE question of introducing the principle of preference into the tariff of theUnited Kingdom was raised at various &quot;Colonial Conferences,&quot; and, in particular,at the Conference of 1907.  For the present purpose, however, it may not be necessaryto go further back than the Imperial  War Conference of  1917, which passed thefollowing resolution :          &apos;&apos; The time has arrived when all possible encouragement should be given  to    the development  of Imperial resources, and especially  to making the Empire    independent of other  countries in respect of food supplies, raw material and    essential industries.    With these objects in  view,  this Conference expresses    itself in favour of          (1.) The principle that each part of the Empire, having due regard to the                 interests of our Allies, shall give specially favourable  treatment                 and facilities  to the  produce and manufactures of other parts  of                 the Empire.         (2.) Arrangements by which intending emigrants from the United Kingdom                 may be induced to settle in countries under the British flag.&quot;    2.  This resolution was intentionally passed in the widest possible terms, so  asto cover  other forms  of preference besides tariff preference.  It was reaffirmed  bythe Imperial Economic Conference of 1923,  as follows :          &quot;This Imperial Economic Conference,  holding  that, especially in present    circumstances, all possible means should be taken to develop the  resources of the    Empire and trade between  Empire countries,  desires to reaffirm the  resolution    on the subject of Imperial Preference  passed by the Imperial War Conference    of 1917.&quot;    3.  Preference was actually introduced into the tariff by Section 8 of theFinance Act, 1919, under which reduced rates of duty were applied to certain goods,already subject to duty, shown &quot; to have been consigned from and grown, produced  or manufactured in the  British Empire.&quot;    The reduction was one-sixth of  the full duty on most articles, one-third  on&quot; McKenna goods &quot; (motor cars,  clocks and watches, musical instruments and cinemafilms), and 30 per cent, to 50 per cent, on wine.  In the case  of spirits the preference       [18643]                                                        B
was granted by means of a small increase of the duty on foreign goods.  The rates of duty on certain articles produced in the United Kingdom (sugar, glucose, molasses,saccharin,  chicory  and  tobacco) were  correspondingly  reduced.   Except for  the exemption  of Empire goods from the scope of  the Key Industry and DepreciatedCurrency duties, the scheme  of preference thus established remained  unchangeduntil  1925.    4.  But the actual benefit arising from the Preference varied with  changes inthe main duties.  The wine duties were increased in 1920.  The duties on tea, cocoa,coffee and chicory were reduced in 1922 and again  in 1924.  The duties on  sugar and cognate articles and on dried or preserved fruits  were reduced and the McKeuna.duties abolished in 1924.    5.  The 1925 Finance Act made several important changes and extensions in thescheme, largely in pursuance  of promises  made by  the British Government  at theImperial Economic  Conference of 1923.   The preference on sugar and cognate goodswas altered from  a proportional to a  specific  basis, which was made  equivalentto the amount of preference in  force prior to 1924, namely, 4s. B^d. per cwt., and wasenacted for a period of ten years, or for so long during that period as the duty onforeign sugar did not fall below 4s. 3^d.  per cwt.  The duties on Empire dried fruitswere abolished.  The proportional basis was retained for tobacco and certain  wines,but the preference was increased.  The McKenna duties were restored, together withtheir previous preference of one-third of the full duty, and this rate of  preferencewas granted in the case of the new duties on hops and on lace and embroidery.In the case of the silk duties, the preference was made  one-sixth of the full duty,which had  been the general rate in the case of ordinary revenue duties. Preference,at the rate of one-third, was granted in respect of the new duties, on cutlery, glovesand gas mantles imposed by the Safeguarding of Industries  (Customs Duties)Act,  1925.    6.  In 1926 the policy of stabilisation applied to sugar in 1925 was extended,and all the preferences (including that on sugar) in force on the 1st July,  1926, werestabilised at their existing values for a period of ten years from that date, or for solong, within that period, as the full duties  do not fall below the value of  the severalpreferences.  In cases where  the full duty is reduced to, or below, the preference,the Empire product is to become free of duty during the remainder of the period.A preference of one-third of the full duty was  granted on the Safeguarding duties on packing and wrapping paper imposed in 1926, on pottery imposed in 1927, and onbuttons and enamelled hollow-ware imposed in 1928.    7.  The 1928 Budget  reduced the  full duties on sugar not exceeding 980  bythe equivalent of 2s. 4rf.  per cwt.  on refined sugar, while leaving unaltered the  fullduty on sugar exceeding 98D.  The preferential rebates on sugar not exceeding  980remain as  before, but a new step in the duty scale was  introduced for Empiresugar  980 /990, on which  the preferential rebate was made 6s.  10-8d.  per cwt.,wdiile  on Empire  sugar exceeding  990 the rebate  was made 5s. lOd. per  cwt:(This  arrangement was  made to  allow Empire raw sugar 98c&apos;/990 to  obtain  thebenefit of the lower duties, and to enable Empire producers of white sugar to  reduce their  prices in accordance with the reduction  of 2s. 4*2. per cwt.&apos;  in the prices ofBritish refined sugar which the British  refiners were able to make as a result of thelower duties on raw sugar.)    8.   The conditions qualifying for preference, as established at the outset of thesystem, provide that, unless at least 25 per cent, of the value of manufactured goods from the Empire is  the result of labour within the Empire, the goods are not entitledto preference.  But in the case of manufactured tobacco, refined  sugar and certain other sugar goods, while only  5 per cent, of the value need be due to Empire labour,the preference is allowed only in respect of the Empire proportion of their dutiableingredients.   From the 27th March,  1927,  the  conditions  as  regards OpticalInstruments  from  the   Empire,  which,  provided  that  they  fulfilled  preferenceconditions, had been exempted from Key Industry  Duty,  were tightened,  and aminimum of 75 per cent, of the value is now required to be the result of labour withinthe Empire in order to qualify these goods for exemption from duty.    9.   Preferential rates of  duty do not apply to beer, table waters, matches and mechanical lighters, playing cards or to the new tax on hydrocarbon oils.  Empiregoods are admitted free of the Key Industry Duties.  The main preferences now inoperation are shown in the following table :

(B.) THE RESULTS OF EXISTING PREFERENCES.    10.  Imperial preference came into force for tea on the 2nd June, 1919, and for most of the other articles to which it applies on the 1st  September,  1919.   It  has there fore been in operation for more than eight complete financial years, and  hasbeen extended to many new articles during the past three financial years under thevarious Safeguarding Duties.       [18643]      &quot;                                                    B 2
     11.  The economic results,  as  far as they can be ascertained, must be judgedin relation to the object  which the policy  of  preference seeks to attain.   This  isgenerally held to be the increase of production within the Empire, in order (a)  to benefit the producers;  (b)  to benefit the consumers in the United Kingdom and otherparts of the Empire, by widening the area  of supply, and in this way maintaining a healthy competition and  preventing  any foreign  country from  establishing  a monopoly;  (c) ultimately,  in some cases, to make the Empire actually self-sufficing.     12.  These  results depend primarily upon an increased consumption of  Empiregoods in this country.  But this does not always signify increased production, sincethe  preference  may  simply operate to divert trade to this country  from othercountries, e.g., Mauritius sugar from India to this country.-  Whether production is affected or not, preference may have the effect of consolidating Empire trade in  thiscountry against  foreign competition.Effect on Consumption.     13.  The statistics and also the detailed  reports which follow  show that theconsumption of Empire cocoa, coffee, sugar, currants, raisins and plums, Unmanufactured-factured tobacco,  rum, wine  and motor cars has increased relatively to the total supply of these articles.  The consumption of Empire tea has also increased,  but notthe relative proportion to  the whole supply.  As regards sugar, the reduction in thepreference in 1924 caused a diversion of Empire sugar to other markets,  but on therestoration of the old preference in 1925  the trade returned to this country.  The pro-portion of Empire rum consumed has increased, but the actual quantity consumedhas declined considerably, in sympathy with the general decline in the consumptionof spirits.  The  consumption of  Empire wine, until  1925, moved very little, out alarge increase has since taken place in  Empire heavy wines.   But the only  articleswhere the changes can be definitely attributed to preference are sugar, tobacco, motorcars, rum and wine.   The  increase in the consumption of the other articles mentionedabove is due to a variety of other causes, which are described in the Appendix.Effect on Production.     14.  The production  of most Preferential  articles in the Empire has increased since the institution of Imperial Preference, but only, in the case of tobacco can it  besaid  without  qualification that Preference has been the cause.   As regards  tea,cocoa and coffee, it may  definitely be said  that Preference has had  little,  if any,effect on production.   The position as  regards dried fruits (raisins, currants  andplums), wine, sugar and motor cars is more  complicated.  Preference has provided a market for the exportation of these  goods  from the Empire  producing areas,  andmay accordingly have increased  production.  This country has been the principalexport  market  for. Dominion dried fruits,  wine and sugar, but  production  inAustralia has been largely carried  on under bounties or other forms of state assistance, and,  both in that country and in the other producing Dominions, the needsof the home market  have, in general,  been of considerable importance;  with theresult that any influence that Preference may have had upon production has probably been  of minor importance.  The import of Canadian motor cars into this  countryincreased under the preference granted  in 1919, the, trade being diverted to  Canadafrom the United  States  of America, and  the  abolition of the  duty in 1924  was followed by  a reduction,  and its reimposition  in  1925 by  a restoration,  of theCanadian trade.  Canadian motor cars, however, have a world-wide market, and thiscountry, although individually important, takes only a  relatively small fraction  ofthe total export.  Hence, although it may be inferred  that production in Canada hasbeen increased by Preference,  the point cannot be strongly pressed.     15.  The case of sugar demands special consideration.  Production  within the ,Empire  (apart  from India, which ordinarily  has to import sugar,  and thereforeshould be excluded) has not increased greatly, except in Australia and  South  Africa.Practically the whole of the preferential rebate has gone to the producers, and in theWest Indies,  at any rate which has been  the most discussed, though it is  not themost important, source of Empire supplies the additional profits  thus secured have for the most  part been  invested  in the industry.   But for  this assistance, it  isprobable that the results  of the great fall in the price of sugar during 1921 wouldhave been much  more serious,  and that  West Indian  production would have decreased.   It can fairly be said, therefore, that preference has helped to maintain,
if, it has not  increased, the production of  sugar in the West  Indies  (also  seeparagraph 18).    16.  It may be added that the reduction in the excise duties on saccharin andglucose, which followed the grant of the preferential rebate on Empire goods, appearsto have led to an increased production of these  articles in this country.Effect  on Prices.    17.  Although it is not a primary object of preference to lower retail prices inthis country, it may be noted that the price of Empire tea was reduced by the whole amount of  the rebate;  that  most, if not all,  of the rebate on Empire wines and  onEmpire cigars has probably been passed on to the consumer;  and that there has been some benefit to the consumer as  regards the cheaper grades of tobacco.  The sugarpreference  does not affect retail prices at all.Widening the Area of Supply.    18.  The only articles subject to preference of which supplies have at any timefallen short are sugar and tea.  As regards sugar, world  supplies from 1919 to 1921and again in 1923 were below demand, and there occurred great fluctuations in prices and speculative movements.   The position was  made worse by the fact that a largeproportion of  the exportable supplies of cane sugar was controlled by  Americanfinanciers,  and it is certainly to the advantage of traders  and consumers in thiscountry, as in other countries, that the total supply has been  increased and the area from which it is drawn widened.  The great improvement in  the position since 1923is due partly to the restoration of the Continental beet industry roughly to its pre-war output, but  also  largely to  increased  crops  of cane  sugar,  mainly Cuban.Production within the Empire has increased  since the  war, but this is  only  veryslightly, if at all, due to preference.  In the  sugar season 1927-28 the total Empireoutput  was about 1 - 4 million tons (excluding India) in a world total  of about25 million tons.  The outstanding increases in sugar production in the Empire havebeen in Australia and South Africa, and preference has  probably been instrumentalmerely in attracting sugar here from these countries.    19.  The fluctuations which have occurred in the tea market since  1919 areoutlined in the section on  tea  below.   The general position  is  that the Empireproduces about  two-thirds  of  the  world&apos;s  requirements outside  the  producing countries themselves, and this country  takes about half of  the world&apos;s exportablesupply.  Empire  supplies, therefore, occupy a dominating  position in the world markets, and there is no evidence that it has been appreciably affected by imperial preference. It is understood that it takes  several years to bring new areas intobearing, and any expansion in production that may take place is likely to be deter-mined  much more by general market conditions than by this  country&apos;s present fiscalarrangements.Statistics.    20.  The following tables are annexed :            Table  I, showing the actual consumption of the Empire and foreign               goods  affected in the  years 1924-25 to 1927-28, as  compared with               the average  consumption for the three pre-war years,  1911,  1912,               1913.           Table  II, showing the proportion of Empire  goods to total consumption               for the same periods.           Table  III, showing the effect on the Revenue.    It  would  not be  safe, however,&apos; to  base conclusions solely  on these  statistics.Information is required as to prices and other factors which have affected the courseof consumption; and questions of quality, &amp;c, are involved  which are a  matter  of expert trade knowledge.  The statements made in the notes in  the Appendix as to the division of the benefit between the various interests concerned  are based mainly uponinformation from trade sources.Effect on the Revenue.    21.  The effect of preference on the  revenue cannot be calculated exactly, since it is impossible to  say what the course of consumption would have been in the absence
of preference.   Table III simply  shows the difference between the full and the preferential duty on all goods to which preference is accorded.  In 1927-28 the total loss to the revenue calculated on this basis is estimated at  6-9 million, as comparedwith  6-5 million in 1926-27,  4-7 million in 1925-26,  2-3 million in 1924-25 and 4-6  million in 1923-24.    The reduction in the cost of preference  to the Exchequer  in 1923-25 was due mainly to the lowering of the duty  on sugar, with a consequential reduction in theamount of the preference; the  increase  in cost in  192S-26 was mainly due to therestoration under the 1925 budget of the sugar preference to its pre-1924 value;  andthe still  higher costs in  1926-27 and 1927-28 were mainly due to increased  con-sumption of Empire sugar and tobacco. The cost of the wine preference has increased.substantially.Custom House, E.C. 3,   December 1928.

DETAILED REPORT ON EXISTING PREFERENCES.                                    SPIRITS.     i.  The preference on spirits was given by imposing an extra 2s. 6^. per proofgallon on foreign spirits, and not, as with other articles, by reducing the full duty,since the  corresponding reduction which would have been required in the duty on home-made spirits would have involved a serious loss of revenue.  The 2s. Qd. was not intended to represent a definite proportion of the spirit duty, which was then 50s. perproof gallon, but was fixed at an amount which might be large enough to make a difference where competition existed between Empire and non-Empire spirits, while not seriously increasing the total duty on spirits, which might have caused diplomaticdifficulties at the time, e.g.,  with France in respect  of brandy.  Hence, the 2s.6d.was not increased when the main spirit duty was raised to 72s. Qd. in  April, 1920.     2.  The kind of spirit chiefly affected is Rum, over 80 per cent,  of the amountconsumed in the United  Kingdom before  the war having been supplied by theEmpire.  This  comes principally from British Guiana and the  West Indies, butsmall quantities are received from South Africa and other Empire countries.   Theconsumption  of  foreign rum has fallen  continuously from 654,000 proof gallons(24 per cent, of  the total in 1920-21, the first full year of preference) to  30,000 proofgallons in 1927-28, about 3 per cent, of the total for the year.  Practically the wholeforeign supply  comes from Cuba.   Cuban  rum is of inferior quality  and is usedalmost  entirely  for compounding, i.e., the  manufacture of liqueurs, &amp;c.  (the rumused for this purpose is mostly of high strength), or for blending with other rum.The additional  tax did not, at  first, cause  any reduction in the amount of Cubanrum used, mainly because large stocks  were already here; but the decline  has since been rapid, and has been  assisted by a revolt of public taste against the flavour ofsuch rum.  The Empire quota of &quot; other sorts &quot; consists mainly of spirits for methy-lation (from South Africa),  the imports  of which have fluctuated greatly, and ofwhisky from the Irish Tree State.
                                      1 L                                     WINE.     3.   The preference on wine was originally fixed at higher rates than on most other articles the rate on  light Empire  wine (i.e., n.e. 30o of proof spirit) being40  per  cent, and on heavy Empire wine (i.e., exceeding 30o but n.e. 42Q) being33-^ per cent, of the full duty in view of the  fact that the duty then formed only asmall element in the price.  The duties were doubled in 1920, but the percentage ratesof preference remained unchanged and their value was thus doubled. The preferenceon light wine then became Is. per gallon, and on heavy wine 2s. per gallon.  In 1925the rate of preference on heavy wine  was raised to 66f per cent,  of the full rate,making the preference 4s.  per  gallon.   The preference on sparkling wine was also increased from 4s. 9^. per gallon to 7s. 3d.   These amounts were stabilised in 1926and were retained under the 1927  Budget,  but the dividing line between the light and the heavy Empire wines was lowered from 30o to 27D, while foreign wines were rendered liable to the higher full rate of duty  when exceeding 250 of proof spirit.    4.  The total consumption of Empire wine was about 700,000  gallons per yeardown to 1924-25, practically all of this being light wines, and had shown very littlemovement under preference. But,  consequent on  the doubled preference on heavywines in 1925, the total consumption rose to over a million gallons  in 1925-26, andexceeded 1 - 7 million gallons in 1926-27. This  increase was practically confined to the category of heavy wines.  The  further advantage conferred on Empire heavy winesby the 1927 Budget through the lowering of the dividing line led to  an increase  inthe figure to nearly 2-5 million gallons in 1927-28.  The clearances of heavy winesrose from 385,000 gallons in 1925-26 to 1,070,000  gallons in  1926-27 and 1,770,000gallons in 1927-28, as compared with 5,000 gallons in 1924-25, and similar small quantities in previous years under the lower preference.   The expansion  in this trade is also due partly to the existence of  an export  bounty  on heavy wines  inAustralia.  This was originally 4s. per gallon, but was reduced to Is.  Qd. per gallonin August 1927; a drawback of Is. 3d. per gallon was, however, granted in additionon the brandy used for the fortification of the wine exported, and as no such draw-back was previously granted, the reduction in  the bounty was in effect Is., i.e., from4s.  to 3s. per gallon.   The Australian Government has now reduced  the bounty onwine exported elsewhere than to Canada  by a further 9d.  per gallon, from  March1928, thus making the total payment 2s.  3d. per gallon.    5.  The increased preference on sparkling  wine  has, so  far,  produced noobservable effect, only a few hundred gallons having been cleared.    6.  Before  the war Australian wine formed about 7 per cent, of the total consumption.   During the war, exports to England were greatly reduced, with theresult that  the  trade had practically  to  be remade after  the war.   Consumptionremained for some years at about 600,000 gallons per year, practically all light wine,i.e., about four-fifths of its pre-war volume, although production in Australia greatlyincreased after  the war.   But in 1926-27 consumption amounted to 1-6 million gallons, including 1,060,000 gallons of heavy  wine, and  in 1927-28 it amounted  to2-3 million gallons, mostly heavy wine (nearly  1-9 million gallons), and representingabout 92 per cent, of the total Empire supply.    7.  The light Australian wine enters, to  some slight degree, into competition,on the one hand, with the cheaper continental clarets and burgundies, being preferredby  some consumers on account of its greater body (its strength is mostly from24 degrees to 26 degrees), and,  on the other  hand,  with the high-class bottled beers.This arises from the  nature of its market  here, which is  restricted  mainly to thelower-middle and better-off working classes.  The comparative stagnation in the con-sumption of this wine may, perhaps, be attributable to  the fact that these  classeshave been badly hit by the continued trade depression.   The policy  of the trade hasbeen not to push it as  against foreign wines, whether called by the same name or not,but rather to recommend it as possessing a uniform quality and distinctive characterof its own.  The heavier Australian wine is a sweet wine of &quot; port &quot; character, andmostly of  about 35 degrees strength.  It competed,  prior to the 1927 Budget, mainly with Tarragona and Lisbon wines, and the cheaper ports, all under 30 degrees andof much the same character, and selling at approximately the same price. The effectof the changes made by the 1927 Budget has been to weaken greatly the competitive       [18643]                                                          D
position of those foreign wines and correspondingly strengthen that of Australian.There is also some competition with British wines.    8.  The trade in South African wine, which has hitherto been of a different typefrom Australian, competing directly  with the ordinary European  light wines con-sumed in this country, is still small, but some big contracts have recently been placed for heavy wines.  Until lately, the wine  was not very carefully made,  the object ofthe growers being quantity rather than quality,  but the South African Governmentand trade agencies are now taking steps to improve the methods of production andto prevent the exportation of inferior wines. The clearances were  150,000 gallons,including 45,000 gallons of heavy wine,  in 1927-28,  as against 110,000 gallons in1926-27  (including 13,000 gallons of  heavy wine), 80,000 gallons  in  1925-26 and100,000 gallons in 1924-25. &quot;    9.  The trade in Empire heavy wines on its present scale is new, and no  basis,therefore, exists for any statement as to the effect of the increased preference granted in 1925.on the prices of this class of wine.   But there is no doubt that part, at anyrate, of  the  benefit goes to the consumer, since, without  the  preference, the  tradecould not exist.  The increase in duty under the 1927 Budget of 2s. per gallon hasbeen passed on to the public in extra  charges of 2d. to Qd. per bottle, but the maincompeting varieties of foreign wine have had to stand an increase of 2s. Qd. per gallonuntil the end of 1927, and subsequently  of 5s. Qd.  per gallon, and this has largelydestroyed their chance of a market.  As regards light wines, when preference was introduced prices of Empire wines to  the public  were reduced by the full amount ofthe rebate, and, so far as known, most of the benefit has continued to be passed on tothe consumer in reduced prices or improved quality or both.  The  increase  of dutyunder the 1927 Budget of 6d. per gallon  on Empire light wines has not been passed on to the public so far as the leading brands of these wines are concerned.                                     TEA.    10.   The  preference on tea was originally one-sixth of the full duty, equal to2d. per lb. from 1919 to 1922,  l^d. per lb. from  1922 to 1924, and since then  %d.per lb., at which figure it was stabilised in 1926.  Before the war Empire tea formedabout 87 per cent, of the total consumption of the country.  Of the remainder,  about per cent, was Java and Sumatra tea, and about 4 per cent. China.  During the sixmonths before the introduction of preference on the 2nd June, 1919, Empire tea rose to 97 per cent, of British consumption, but this was owing mainly to war restrictionson the import of foreign tea.    11.   The  trade  anticipated that  the effect of preference would be to  excludeJava and Sumatra tea  from the British market,  thus causing it to compete moreseverely with Indian and Ceylon tea in other markets, and also to exclude the cheaperclass of  China tea.  In point of fact, Java and Sumatra tea has more  than held itsown  in  the British market.   Throughout the period 1920 to  1926 the proportionranged from 8 per cent, to 13 per cent., and in 1927-28 it was 15-1 per cent, of thetotal, i,e., 60-7 million lbs., out of a  total consumption of  402 million lb.  At  thesame time, Empire tea has had to face increased competition in other markets fromJava tea, particularly in Australia, but also in North America.   This is not due,however, to preference,  but partly to the rapid  and continuous  growth  and  the improved methods of the industry in Java  and Sumatra, and partly to the check onthe Empire output arising from  the  policy of  restriction adopted by Indian and ceylon planters, as explained below.    12.  China tea is of two classes. One is a high quality tea,  consumed eitherpure or in high-class blends on account of its special flavour and other qualities.The consumption of this tea, which was estimated at from 3 to 6 million lb. out of atotal pre-war  consumption of  China tea of about  11  million lb., is probably  fairlystable, and not likely to be affected by the extra duty.  The other class is cheap andcharacterless tea, which serves the sole purpose of reducing the price of the blend inwhich it is used.&apos;  The consumption of this varied greatly from year to year before thewar, in accordance with the relation of its price to that of the cheapest Indian and ceylon tea.   The cheap China tea was probably almost excluded, in 1920, the total consumption  of China tea in that year being&apos;only 3-5 million lb. But that wastemporary, being due to the drop in the price of Empire tea mentioned below, which,together with the 2d. extra duty then in force,  prevented common China tea from having any chance of a sale.  From 1921 the rise in the price of cheap Empire and
Java teas brought cheap China tea into greater demand,  and the consumption ofChina  tea,  as a  whole, rose  steadily  until  1924-25,  when  it amounted  to14-2 million lb., i.e., 3-5 per cent, of the total consumption.  In the last three years it has varied between 2 per  cent, and 3 per cent, of the total consumption, and in1927-28 it was 10-7 million lbs., i.e., 2-7 per cent, of the total consumption.    13.  The tea market has fluctuated greatly since 1919.  In that and the following year there  was a  glut of common tea, and the consequential fall in prices wasdisastrous to planters.    They  therefore  adopted the policy of &quot;fine plucking,&quot;-which  at one and the  same time improves  in  the  quality  of the output andrestricts its volume.   This policy has been completely successful, and has been more or less maintained ever  since.  For example, the average price of NorthernIndian  tea, which fell from  Is. 2ld. to b^d. per lb.  during 1920, rose steadilythroughout  1921  and 1922,  and stood  at about Is.  5d.  per lb. from the end  ofthe latter year until  the middle of 1924.  Prices  then rose to Is. %d. per lb.  atthe end of 1924, fell to Is. Id. per lb. by September 1925, recovered to Is. 10^.per lb.  early in 1926,  but were down to  Is. Ad.  per lb. by the end of the year.  Thefall in  1925, and again in 1926, was due to an increased output of poor quality tea.The rise at  the end of 1925, which formed the occasion of an enquiry in 1926  bythe Food Council into wholesale prices, was due to the anticipation of short supplies from India  and  of increased consumption in this country.   In 1927 prices rose toIs. Id.  per lb. by May, and remained steady about this figure until September, whenreports of poor crop conditions in India led to an advance to  Is. lid. per lb.  Reducedconsumption and more  favourable  Indian reports then led to  reductions.  At  theend of  1927 the price  was down to about Is.  6d. per lb., and throughout 1928 it hasranged about Is. 3d. to Is. bd. per lb.    14.  During the whole of  this period the average price  of Java tea has generallybeen several pence per lb. lower than that  of  Indian.   In 1928, for instance,  themost usual weekly average prices for Java tea have been from lid. to Is. Id. per lb.It has been mainly the  relatively high level of  Empire prices that has given  an opening  for  the increased use of foreign teas.  The reduction  in  the  amount  ofpreference in 1922, and again in 1924, has probably had very little to do with  it.The net result of these movements is that the proportion of Empire tea relatively tothe whole supply of the country is, after various small fluctuations, now 5^ per cent.below that  prevailing before the war.  The  actual amount of Empire tea consumedhas, however, increased considerably from 261 million lb.  per annum for the wholeUnited Kingdom before the war, to 330 million  lb. in 1927-28 for Great Britain andNorthern Ireland only.    15.

The benefit of the preference on tea has throughout been passed on to theconsumer in reduced prices.                                    COCOA.    17.  Over three-fourths of the total receipts  of the cocoa duty are from rawcocoa.   The next  largest item is cocoa preparations,  but practically nothing  is received from the Empire under this heading.    18.  Before the war, a little less than half of the raw cocoa consumed in thiscountry was of Empire origin, about half of this coming from British  West Africa
and most of the remainder from the British West Indies.   But the British west african cocoa industry (first in the Gold Coast and later in Nigeria) was developingrapidly, and by 1916 the Empire proportion had risen to 66  per cent., the increasebeing entirely due to West Africa.   By 1918, before the introduction of preference,the Empire proportion had risen to about  85 per cent.  This  had been  accompaniedby a great increase in the  total  amount of  cocoa  consumed  in this  country from24,000 tons in 1913 to 56,000 tons in 1918.   By the time preference came into force the Empire proportion had  risen  to 92 per cent., and it has since remained at about that level.  It is clear, therefore, that neither the increased output of cocoa in british west Africa nor  the higher proportion  of Empire  cocoa consumed  here can be attributed to the operation of preference.   The cost of production in the Gold coast and Nigeria is very low,  and, although an export duty is levied in both colonies, thiscocoa has ousted the cheapest varieties of foreign cocoa (e.g., Bahia,  San  Thome,Cameroon), which were largely consumed before the war.   But the amount exported to this country  is only about 20 per cent, of the West African output.  The  Empireas a whole produces about 60 per  cent, of the world&apos;s output.     19.  The only other part of the  Empire which sends any considerable quantity ofcocoa is the British West Indies, which now supplies about 8 per cent, of our total consumption.  The chief market for their output is North America, and the quantitysent to  Great  Britain  has fallen considerably  since  1919.  Production is notincreasing.  The cocoa is of much higher quality than West African, but the latter is improving considerably in quality and is a severe competitor, both in the Britishand  foreign markets.     20.  The preferential rebate, when at  7s. per cwt., was about 6 per cent, of theprice of the cheapest  grade  (West African) at its maximum,- and about 20 per cent.in 1921 after the fall of prices. After the reduction of the rebate to 4s. 8d.  per cwt.in  1922,  it  was about  15 per  cent,  of  the  lowest  West  African prices ruling(1923).   The rebate of 2s. 4ol. in force-since 1924, at which  figure it is stabilised,now represents about 5 per cent, of West  African prices.  It is doubtful  whetherthe  producers have  derived any direct benefit from  the preference,  which, so far asknown, appears to  have been shared between the manufacturers and consumers inthis country. -, -                                   COFFEE.     21.  Before the war the proportion of Empire coffee consumed in this country isestimated to have been about 20 per cent.,  most of  which came from India.  Underpreference it has ranged between 40 per cent, and  50  per cent., except in 1922-23,when, owing to the short crops and poor quality of Empire coffee, it fell to 35 percent.  But this increase from 20 per cent, to nearly 50 per cent, is not attributable topreference.   It is  chiefly  due to the fact that,  during  and since the war,  theplantations  in East Africa, mainly Kenya, which had been  laid down some years before, have come into full yield, making the latter colony the largest Empire pro-ducing area.  This East African coffee has  replaced some of the medium quality andcheaper foreign coffees in the British market.  A certain amount of coffee is receivedfrom Uganda, and  the grant of preference to Tanganyika, from which some high-class coffee is received, has slightly increased the proportion of coffee admitted at theEmpire rate.     22.  The amount received from India, once considerable, has now  dwindled to only 9 per cent, of the total supply, owing, apparently, in the main to  a diversion to other markets.   The  Indian Fiscal Commission of  1921-22 stated  that  it waspossible that the Indian  coffee planters received something in  the nature of  a directbonus, but that it was not  clear  whether  there was any large scope for increased production.  This statement appears to have been made  when the preferenceamounted to 7s. per cwt.  It may be noted that, according to recent  reports, tea isnow being planted on old coffee estates in India.     23.  Trade opinion appears  to be  that preference has had little or no effect on production anywhere in the Empire.  The general position is  that, as coffee is not a popular  drink in this country;, the British market is  small, and is almost entirelyconfined to high quality coffee, the supply of which from the Empire is limited.     24.  The amount of the preference (7s.  per cwt. until 1922, then 4s. 8d. until1924, and  now 2s.  4d.,  at  which figure it is stabilised) was always top small, in
relation to the value of coffee, to affect the trade to any great extent, and, even ifpassed on in full to the consumer, could only have affected retail prices fractionally.At 2s. 4d. it is merely trivial.                                    SUGAR.    25.  Prior to  1924  the  duty  on sugar  exceeding 98  degrees polarisation:.was  25s.  8d. per  cwt.  and  the preferential&apos; rebate was  one-sixth  of  this,namely,  4s.   3%d.  per  cwt.,   the preference  on  sugars  polarising  at lower-degrees being proportionately lower.  The  reduction of duty to 11s.  ad. per cwt.by  the 1924  Budget  automatically  reduced  the  amount  of the  preference  toIs.  ll^d.  per cwt.   The  1925 Budget  restored the  preference to  the  specificsum of  4s.   S^d.  per  cwt., and  stabilised  it  at  that  figure  for ten  years,or  for  so  long,   within  that  period,   as  the  duty  on  foreign  sugar  does-not fall  below 4s. 3\d. per cwt. *  The 1926 Budget added a further year to this.period, by including sugar in the general  ten-year stabilisation of all  preferences..The 1928  Budget  maintained the  preferences on  sugars  below  98 degrees,  butincreased the preference on sugar above 98 degrees to 6s. 10-8^. per cwt. for 98 degreesto 99 degrees sugar and 5s.  lOd. per cwt. for sugar ex. 99 degrees, as explained onpage 2 (paragraph 7).    26.  The history of sugar throughout the  whole period of  preference has been:one of great  fluctuation of supplies and prices.  The price  of Cuban 96 degrees.sugar, for example, has oscillated  between  10 and  30 per ton,  the former leveloccurring in 1921 and 1925 and the latter in 1923 and again in 1924.  At the endof 1926 a rapid recovery from the  low level of 1925 brought prices to  16  per ton,but they are now (December 1928)  down to a little over  10 per ton.  The Cubanauthorities have, for some time, but so far without success,  been  endeavouring tobring about a stabilisation of world production, in order to avoid the  losses imposedupon their leading industry by these heavy fluctuations.  But, whatever the level ofprices,  Empire producers have always been able to obtain almost the whole of thepreference.    27.   The result until 1924-25  was a great increase in the quantities of Empiresugar consumed here, from about 110,000 tons per year (about 7 per cent, of the total supply) in the three years before the war (conditions during the  war were, of course,abnormal) to about 368,000 tons in 1923-24, representing over 25 per cent, of thetotal  supply.   The reduction in the preference from 4s. 3^d. to Is. ll^d. per cwt.under the 1924 Budget was  followed by  a diversion of Empire  sugar  from thiscountry to other Empire markets, and  the supply to this country fell to 161,000 tons,i.e.\ about 10 per cent, of the total in 1924-25.   Mauritius, then the principal Empiresource of supply, sent the bulk of its exports to India, its original  market beforepreference.   The West Indies, similarly, increased their exports to Canada, which,.for some years, had given a preference to West Indian sugar of approximately thesame amount as  that originally granted by this  country, and which  had taken thelarger  proportion  of  the West Indian output.   The  restoration of the Britishpreference to its pre-1924 figure by the 1925 Budget  restored the  trade in Empiresugar in 1925-26 to practically the same  actual figure as in  1923-24,  clearancesamounting to 367,000  tons, i.e., 22-6 per cent, of a somewhat increased  total.   In1926-27 the Empire clearances  increased to 482,000 tons, i.e., 30-4 per cent, of thetotal supply, but in 1927-28 fell to 412,000 tons, i.e., 27 per cent, of the total, largely on account of short crops in Australia.  .    .    28.

    29.  The total amount of sugar grown in the Empire (apart from India, whichordinarily has to import sugar) is now considerably larger than before.  The bulk ofthe increase has  occurred  in Australia and in South Africa.  Preference  has probably had very little, if anything, to do with it, although it serves to attract-exports  from  those  Dominions.

In the &quot;West Indies, where the sugar industry is of great importance, thelarge profits which preference and the general rise in sugar prices brought to the producers enabled them to pay off loans, buy new machinery and generally develop the industry.  But the position was greatly altered by the collapse of sugar prices in1921, and  the planters  in the  West  Indies and British Guiana fell  into serious difficulties and asked for increased preference.  This could not be granted because ofits cost to the Exchequer, but it is largely  owing to their representations that theamount of the preference was stabilised at 4s. 3^d. per cwt.    31.  It may be noted that the West Indies, together with British Guiana, do notappear  likely  to become  a very important source of supply to  this country.   their total output is comparatively small and the cost of production  is high.Attitude of the British Refiners.    32.  From the refiners&apos;&quot; point of view, Empire sugar falls into two classes, thatwThich they buy and refine, and that which goes as imported into consumption or toBritish  makers of sugar goods.   As regards the former, they  do not.object to thepreference.    33.  The second class of Empire  sugar may be fully refined or in the form of white or coloured sugars, which have been manufactured by simpler and cheapermethods than those of British  refineries and  are not so completely purified andcrystallised.   So far as the sugar exceeds 98 degrees polarisation, i.e., is practicallyfully refined,  the  refiners have complained that it competes unfairly with their ownproducts, since it obtains the full preferential rebate (except in so far as it may beproduced from non-Empire raw sugar), whereas the rebate which they obtain on their products, in accordance  with the proportion of Empire sugar which they use,  is ofno advantage  to them, the price paid for Empire sugar being correspondingly higher.They would prefer accordingly that the preference should be confined to  raw sugar.This would encourage the Empire producers to sell raw sugar to the British refinerrather than to turn  it into a completely  finished  article  ready for consumptionwithout passing through a British refinery.    34.  So far,  however, the refiners&apos; position has not been seriously damaged bythe competition of  Empire white sugar,  and  their position in 1927 showed some improvement  as compared with 1926.  The total clearances of direct-consumptionsugar, both white and coloured, from  the Empire fell from 140,000 tons in 1920 to59,000 tons in 1925, rose to 128,000 tons in 1926, and fell again to 98,000 tons in1927. As regards Empire sugar exceeding 98 degrees polarisation, which is the whitesugar complained of, 69,000 tons were cleared for direct consumption in 1927 against80,000 tons in 1926, 25,000 tons in 1925 and 74,000 tons in 1920.  During the same
 period the refiners&apos; own output varied from 785,000 tons in 1920 to 880,000 tons in 1927, after reaching 940,000 tons in 1923.     35.   As., regards  the future, Mauritius  is  definitely  pursuing a  policy of increasing the output of high-quality white sugar, and this sugar may become  a growing competitor with British refined sugar within the limits set by the capacity for production in Mauritius.  Competition in white sugar may. possibly develop from Queensland and Natal, although it is,.perhaps, less likely  since this yearns change in the sugar duties, whereby the preference on Empire white sugar has been slightly reduced  as against British refined sugar.     36.   It may be noted for purposes of comparison that, mainly  owing to the&apos; restoration of the European beet sugar industry, there was down to 1927 a very con- si der able growth in the consumption of foreign refined sugar.  This was about 25 per cent, of  the total consumption in 1923,  and about 33 per cent, in 1927,  the actual quantities being 370,000 tons in 1923, and 520,000  tons in 1927.  But under  this year&apos;s change in the sugar duties the proportion of foreign refined sugar has fallen substantially/  :     37.   The refiners have also objected in the past to the subsidy on home-grown sugar fully manufactured by British beet factories, and have urged that, the subsidy should be restricted to raw sugar not exceeding 98 degrees polarisation.  But since the changes made by the last Budget in favour of the refiners they have worked more in harmony with the beet-sugar interests. Sugar Composite goods.     38.  Apart from canned fruit, the imports of other sugar goods from the Empire are  trivial; A certain quantity of canned fruit (about 3 per cent, of the total in 1927-28  as compared with 7 per cent, in 1926-27 and 1925-26, 5  per cent, in 1924-25 and 10 per cent, in 1923-24) is imported from the Empire, mainly from Australia and the Cape.  The fall in consumption during the past year has been due to a short- fruit crop in Australia.  The industry in both Dominions  has groAvn rapidly, but is still in a comparatively undeveloped  condition,  and, up  to the  present, has not been able to compete on even terms, as regards grading and general preparation of the fruit, with the  American product, which forms the  bulk of the import into this country.   It is reported that the price of  canned peaches in London  is more than 2s. per dozen below the cost of production in Australia, and that the  Australian Government has recently given a bounty on canned  fruits exported to the United Kingdom during the 1927-28 season amounting, in the case of peaches,  to Is. 8d. per dozen 30-oz. cans.     39.  In this competition with  the American product, however, preference  can be of very little assistance. The average  duty paid on the sugar in a cwt. of foreign. canned fruit is now about Is. Qd., while that paid on Empire fruit is  about  10*2. per cwt., i.e., the preference is worth about 8d.  per cwt. on the average.  In point of fact, it was ascertained some time ago that the Australian canned  fruit paid a slightly higher duty on the average than the Californian, in spite of the  preference,. because it contained a larger proportion of sugar. Position of the Consumer.     40.  Preference has not  affected the  price  of British refined  sugar,  since practically the whole benefit has gone to  the producer, nor  is it likely that this position will be altered in the near future.  The benefit of the preference on Empire sugar which goes directly into consumption, or direct  to British  manufacturers, also. appears to be obtained mainly by the producers.  This also applies to Empire goods containing sugar.  Nor has the subsidy on home-grown sugar reached the consumer.. Effect on Revenue.  .    41.   As preference has not lowered the price of sugar in  the United Kingdom,. it cannot have increased consumption.   It follows that the revenue has lost the whole^ amount of the difference between the full and the preferential rates of duty on Empire sugar and goods containing sugar, consumed in this country.   For 1927-28  this represented  If million.  To this must be  added the loss on the. reduced duties of&quot; Excise on. home-grown sugar,  glucose, molasses, and  saccharin;  this amounted to-nearly  1 million, representing a total of nearly  2f million for  the year.      [18643]                                                        E 2
                                 DRIED FRUIT.     42.  From the institution of Imperial Preference until July 1925, Empire driedfruit received a rebate of one-sixth of the full duty.  The amount of the rebate wasAd. per cwt. throughout on currants, and on the other dutiable dried fruit (raisins,plums and figs) Is. 9d. per cwt., until  the reduction  of  the  duty  in  1924,  andsubsequently Is. 2d. per cwt.  Under the 1925 Budget all Empire dried fruit becamefree of duty from the 1st July, 1925, and the value,of the preference is therefore now2s. per cwt. on currants and 7s. per cwt.  on the other dried fruits, at which figuresit has been stabilised for ten years from 1926.     43.  Empire currants are practically all from Australia.  Consumption  grewrapidly until  1926, hut in 1927  it suffered a set-back owing to&apos;a decline in crops,which has reduced supplies to this country during  1928.   In 1927-28 Empirecurrants represented 7-J per cent,  of the total consumption,  as  against  13 percent, in  1926-27, lOJ per cent,  in  1925-26, and 15$ per cent, in 1924-25.    Thetrade was insignificant  before the war.  The old preference, being only id. per cwt.,was quite trivial, and the existing rebate,  which, it  is thought, goes to the producers,is also too small to have much effect.     44.  The consumption of  Empire raisins has  grown much more rapidly  thanthat of currants.  It amounted to nearly 42 per cent, of the total  consumption in1927-28, as against 23 per cent, in 1926-27, 36 per cent, in 1925-26, and 2\ per  cent.before the  war.   The  decrease in 1926-27 was mainly due to reduced Australiancrops, which was made good by an increased supply of competitive foreign varieties.The old preference  of Is. 9d. and then Is. 2d. per cwt. had probably  very little  to do with the growth of the trade,  but the present rebate of 7s.  per cwt.  may be ofconsiderable assistance.  When the increased preference became effective in July 1925sellers endeavoured to obtain the whole of the increase, viz., 5$. 10c?. per cwt.   Theywere unsuccessful and were compelled to pass on a  certain amount of it to the tradein this country.  No effect on retail prices has been  traced.     45.  The Australian Government has made dried fruit the leading industry inthe newly irrigated areas on the Murray  River, and the  production of currants andraisins, which  in 1922 was  19,000  tons, has increased to about 55,000 tons in thecurrent year.  The export quota has been about 80  per cent,  of the total production for some years, but the actual exports have, of course, varied with the crop.  Canadanow gives  a preference of  14 per ton on Australian dried  fruit, but hitherto thetrade  has  not shown much life  on account of Californian competition,  and  thiscountry takes the bulk of the  exports.   The quality, and also the  packing of theAustralian output,  has been severely criticised in trade circles in this country duringthe past year, but there is no doubt that the Australian authorities are endeavouringto improve the competitive position of the trade.     46.  The production of dried plums in the Empire is small.  The main source ofsupply is South Africa, but imports from Australia are also considerable.  Dried-figs are not produced on a commercial scale in the  Empire.                                    TOBACCO.     47.  The preference on tobacco  from 1919 until 1925 was one-sixth of the full rate, amounting to about  Is. 4d per lb. on the main rate of duty (i.e.,  on Unmanufactured-factured unstemmed tobacco containing 10 per cent, or more of moisture).  The 1925Budget increased the preference to one-fourth of the full duty, i.e., to 2s. O^d. per lb.,and the 1926 Budget stabilised it at this amount for ten years.  Empire tobacco, there-fore, bore the full amount of the increase of duty, viz., 8d. per lb., imposed by the1927 Budget, and the main preferential rate  is now 6s. 9\d. per lb.,  as comparedwith 8s. 10c?. per lb. on foreign tobacco. ,   .Unmanufactured Tobacco.                                              . .     48.  In the years 1911-13 Empire leaf tobacco formed only 1-4 per cent, of thetotal  consumption  in  this  country,  the bulk  of the  supply being American.
Preference increased the proportion of Empire tobacco, so that it exceeded 7 per cent.in 1923-24, and was 8^ per cent, in 1924-25.  Under the higher preference of 1925the proportion  of Empire  tobacco  has expanded  even more  rapidly,  reaching10-9 per cent, in 1925-26, 13-6 per cent,  in 1926-27, and 15-2 per cent, in 1927-28.    49.  Empire  leaf was  formerly  inferior in quality and badly manufactured,and therefore, although it was much cheaper than American, British manufacturershad little inducement to use it.  The preferential rebate has altered the positionconsiderably, and manufacturers have found it increasingly worth while both to useEmpire tobacco and to educate  the public to like it.  The use of Empire leaf  hasbeen mainly  restricted to  the manufacture of the cheaper pipe mixtures, eitherblends  or  whole-Empire  brands, and  excluded  from those  where flavour is ofimportance.  The result was, under the Is. 4d.  preference, the sale of whole-Empirebrands of pipe tobacco at \d. per ounce less than the usual price Xj\d. instead of8d. per ounce), and in the case of blends  the use of the Empire leaf probably enableda better tobacco to be sold at  a given price.  The  increase  of the preference to2s.  O^d. per lb.  in 1925 enabled the trade to issue whole-Empire brands at Id.  perounce, the  consumer in these cases benefiting practically to the whole extent of  theadditional  preference.  Under the higher  duty of 1927 the price of these tobaccoshas largely risen to 1\d. per ounce, but in other cases a change in composition by theuse of an increased proportion  of Empire tobacco has frequently enabled the saleof pipe tobacco to  be continued at the  old price.   Empire leaf has hitherto provided a very small proportion of the amount used for  cigarettes, but there is an increasing number of  Empire-blend and of  whole-Empire cigarettes on the market, as suppliesof suitable cigarette tobacco increase.    50.  The principal sources  of supply are Nyasaland, India,  Canada, rhodesia and British North Borneo,  and in all of these preference has stimulated production to a greater or less extent.   But  while in India and Canada  the industry is of longstanding and was originally built up  to supply the  home market, in  the othercountries it is on an exporting basis  only.   In most of these countries the Govern-ments  are taking an active part  in aiding the development of the industry, and  theImperial Tobacco Company has rehandling plants in Nyasaland, Southern rhodesia and Canada.  In  India production has always been large and quality poor,  andpreference  thus  may not have had much effect, but it has brought into existence alarge  export trade to  this country  in  cheap,  low-grade, but well-manufacturedtobacco, which is  used here to give bulk and represents  about 20 per cent, of  theEmpire tobacco consumed here.   The Canadian home industry appears in the pastto have been  overshadowed  by the American, but it is now engaged increasingly in competition with the  latter  on a quality basis, and a. considerable influx of farmersfrom Kentucky into Ontario is taking place.  Production was 17\ million lb. beforethe war (in 1910),  but has fluctuated greatly since; by  1921 it was only 13 million  lb.,but by 1927 it had risen to 47 million lb.  The recovery since  1921, in which yearexportation to this country on a  large scale began, must be largely attributed to  thedemand from this country  under preference for  a  high-quality tobacco.  british north Borneo produces cigar tobacco  of relatively high quality,  but, as the consump-tion of cigars in this country is stagnant, the industry has moved little of recent years.The movement  of  production under preference in the other  countries has been asfollows:                                        1919.            1926.          1927.                                                                 (estimated)                                     Million lb.        Million lb.      Million lb.

Nyasaland tobacco, which represents about one-third of the total Empireconsumption, has mostly had a somewhat pronounced flavour which has rendered its use unsuitable except in the cheaper pipe tobaccos, but great improvements in qualityare being made.  Rhodesian leaf is the main Empire cigarette tobacco.  The natural,but somewhat restricted,  market for the output is South Africa, which  grants a preference substantially higher than the United Kingdom, but the major proportionof the output now comes to this country.  The average import values of unmanufac-
tured tobacco from the main Empire countries as compared with the United States-over the last five years have been :                                    .    ,	1923.	1924.	1925.	1926.	1927.British North Borneo Rhodesian Canadian ..

The distribution of  the  preference has varied according to the class of tobacco concerned, but on the whole the position of Empire growers appears to havebeen strengthened of late.   Complaints were made under the Is. M. preference byproducers in Rhodesia and Nyasaland against the small proportion of the preferencegoing to them, and this attitude was supported by statements made in a book, entitled&quot;Rubber, Tea and Cacao,&quot; issued by the Federation of British Industries in 1924,which stated that little, if any, of the preference reached the growers.  But the con-tinued increase in  the demand for  preferential tobacco has  enabled producers tosecure an increased share of the preference in the prices they realise.  The upward trend of many of the average import prices shown above is perhaps of  significance inthis connection.  As regards the additional rebate of Sd. per lb., granted in 1925, ithas already been noted that the retail price of proprietary brands of pipe tobaccomade wholly of Empire leaf was reduced by. that amount.   ,                  ;    53.  The Indian Fiscal  Commission of 1921-22  stated that,   even with  thepreference, Indian tobacco was at a disadvantage in the English market as comparedwith  other tobaccos.   This, however, is due to the  fact that Indian tobacco is relatively very poor in quality (see import values given  above). But preference has,to some extent at least, improved the position,&apos; as, without it, Indian tobacco wouldhave no remunerative market at all in this country.  The Indian Trade commissioner in London (Mr.  A. F.  Lindsay),  in evidence  before the Royal Commission  on agriculture in India,  1927, apparently agreed that preference had increased theexport of leaf.                          1Manufactured Tobacco.    54.  Empire cigars are imported mainly from India&apos;. These are of comparativelyinferior quality,  and enter into competition rather with  British  cigars than with.other imported cigars.   The British, duty on Empire cigars  has been criticised onaccount of its weight, despite the preferential reduction.  The  cigar trade as a whole has.been  a stagnant one for years,  cigars  being  replaced  in public favour  bycigarettes, but preference by reducing the price  of Empire cigars has enabled them.to hold their position better than they otherwise would have  done.   The only other-manufactured tobacco  of Empire  origin consists of a  little  &quot;Boer tobacco&quot; from south Africa and very small quantities of cigarettes.                                 MOTOR CARS.    55.  A  rebate of one-third of the full duty  was granted in  respect  of  theMcKenna duties on the institution of Imperial Preference in 1919, and remained inforce until the abolition of the duties in 1924.  On their restoration in  July 1925,after a lapse of eleven months, the original preference was also restored.  The onlyMcKenna goods of importance from the point of view of preference are motor ears.The Empire cars  are  practically  all Canadian manufactured by American firms,..established on both sides of the border,  which use their Canadian, factories largely to cater for their trade within  the British Empire.  A certain proportion-of the totalimports in earlier years have also consisted of Ford parts from the Irish Free State,but the imports of these have now ceased, in consequence of the reorganisation of thework of the Ford Company in this country and in Europe during the past year.
    56.  Cars of Empire origin formed about 4 per cent, of the value of the totalclearances of imported dutiable vehicles in 1920-21, but the proportion rose rapidly,and during 1923-24 and the  few months of 1924-25, before the abolition of theduties, it amounted to about 36 per cent, of  the total.  The abolition of the duty  in1924 led to a reduction in the imports  of  Canadian  and an  increase in importsof American cars.  The reimposition of the duties restored the Empire proportion to 36 per cent, in 1925-26, in  1926-27 it amounted to only 18 per cent, of the totalclearances of imported cars, but in 1927-28 it amounted to 26 per cent, of a greatlyincreased total importation.   No  comparable figures  exist  for  the period beforepreference, as dutiable and exempt cars were not distinguished  before the duty was imposed in September 1915, and shortly afterwards (March 1916) the importation ofdutiable  cars was prohibited  except under  licence.  The exemptions in favour ofcommercial vehicles and tyres granted when  the duties were imposed have now been withdrawn, the former in 1926 and the latter in 1927.    57.  The foreign imports  consist mainly  of  French and Italian  cars.   Thesecars approximate to the ordinary English type, viz., they are  of the  low nominalhorse-power,  high-efficiency engine type,  and otherwise are economical in running costs.   They are in competition primarily with the home product rather than withthe better-class American car  to which the bulk of the Canadian imports into thiscountry belong.   The actual quantity of Empire imports during the last financialyear is the largest on record under  preference, and, in view of the different characterof the respective markets involved, the growth in the total foreign trade during thepast  two years  and the  lower  proportion of  the  total  imported  consumptionrepresented by Empire cars must  be attributed to the  general growth of motoringin this country, and does not represent a substitution of foreign for Empire products./
