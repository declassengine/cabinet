SECRET                                             Copy No.   28&apos;CP.  354 (28).                             CABINET.LIMITATION  OF NAVAL  ARMAMENTS.SYNOPSIS  OF  SUGGESTED REPLY TO  NOTE  FROM  THE GOVERNMENT OF  THE                           UNITED STATES.            (Circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)    IT gave His  Majesty&apos;s  Government great satisfaction to reach, atWashington in 1921,  an accord with the  United States-upon the  basis ofparity in  capital ships and certain other specified units.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment made  it clear at the time that the extension of the principle ofparity to  cruisers  would not be acceptable to them, for the reason that itwould not take  into  account the special  circumstances of Great Britainand of the British Empire.  His Majesty&apos;s Government were not awarefrom  anything that passed at  Washington, either in political  or navalcircles, that the United States took exception to the British position.   TheWashington Naval Agreement was  therefore concluded on a basis whichregulated  agreeably to all  concerned the  main  offensive power  of  therespective iNavies, and left  the smaller classes of vessels unregulated byagreements, but admittedly open to further hopeful  and friendly study.When, therefore, in 1927 the Government of the United States  proposed a fresh Naval Conference at Geneva, His  Majesty&apos;s Government suggested as their contribution that  an attempt should be  made to limit by agreement the construction of the next largest class of vessels, viz., the  cruisers carrying8-inch guns.  This type  of  cruiser is, by its  offensive  power,  speciallyassociated with the battle fleets, and a lack of parity in this offensive typeof cruiser might well  be held to derange the parity already established for capital ships.  As His Majesty&apos;s Government had at this time a consider-able preponderance in this class of vessels, they felt entitled to hope that this new further extension of the principle of  parity would be agreeable to the       [18481][This Document is the Property  of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1                Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1928.
united States, and it would certainly constitute a marked and importantadvance towards a comprehensive naval agreement.  There would, of course,remain the still smaller classes of vessels which all Powers would be free tobuild according to their needs, as they viewed them, or to their choice.  Butit seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government that later on other classes of cruisers,even in this quasi-defensive sphere, might gradually be the subject of agree-ment; and at any rate no door was closed upon the further progress of naval agreement and of economy.                               .     However, the Government of the United States, for reasons which HisMajesty&apos;s Government are bound to respect, preferred either to have a totallimitation of tonnage for all cruiser forces,  or that all countries  should remain free in the sphere of cruiser construction.  His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment bowed to this view while  adhering to their own.   They  felt that an equal tonnage limit, translated by the United  States into cruisers of  thehighest offensive power, while British needs Avould require to be translated into a larger number of smaller vessels, would undoubtedly not realise theprinciple  of parity in main  naval strength to which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment nave subscribed, and  would, in fact,  leave  the  British Navy in  aposition of definite and  final inferiority to the United States.  This wasnot  what the British Government believed the United States to  desire;nor  is it a situation to which they themselves would  wish to be committed by treaty.     In  the presence of the Note which they received  in September fromthe  United States, His Majesty&apos;s Government now feel  that probably thegeneral cause of disarmament,  and especially naval  disarmament, will bebetter  served by a period  of silence  and goodwill than by  a process of active and detailed negotiation.  The sustained and prolonged discussion bytechnical  experts of the problems of relative naval power would only at thepresent time tend to concentrate attention upon an aspect of  internationalrelationships which His Majesty&apos;s Government hope will steadily  recede in importance.  Such a discussion upon the details of ships and guns, upon thehypothesis that  such  instrumentalities will  be again  invoked, would be entirely out of harmony Avith the increasing  confidence and intimacy nowexisting between the Great Powers, and particularly between Great Britainand the United States.  More especially is this true upon the morrow of the  signature of the Pact of Peace, framed upon the initiative and by the wisdom of the United States,  and to  which almost every country in theworld has now adhered, by which the idea of war is solemnly banished from international affairs.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government have,  since  the  war, allowed their naval strength to fall continually, and  have watched,  with composure born of confidence, the rise  and expansion of the American Navy.  They believe that the increasing sense of world  security which must follow from the recent Pact, coupled with the constant financial  induce- ments to  a reduction of non-productive expenditure, may well be left for a while to play their part in  policy.  They will endeavour, as they have done

Their aim isidentical with that of the :TJnited^States, maniely,&apos; that the two nations whohave so much in common may be represented upon the waters of the worldby what is truly and actually an equal naval strength and status;  and theyconfine themselves with  hope and sincerity to a continuance of ireedominnaval matters  on which  agreement  has not yet been reached, and: toneighbourly goodwill in  all.                                        .November 19, 1928.
