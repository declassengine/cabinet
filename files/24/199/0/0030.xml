Memorandum by  the Lord  Privy Seal.              There is a League of Nations Committee sitting         at Geneva on the Private Manufacture of Arms and         Aimiunltion and  Implements of War.   The Committee must         decide this week upon a Draft Report dealing with the         supervision and publicity.of Private Manufacture,         including a veto where the weapons are unlawful by inter-         national law.   A Sub-Committee of the Committee of         Imperial defence has considered this Report in order to         frame the instructions to our representatives.   After         these had been settled under the bolief that no Private         Manufacture of instruments of nar were affeoted which         Is &quot;on the order and behalf cf tho Stats&quot;,  It was                                           clause         discovered that, though this saving/certainly covers         all instruments whioh are permitted  by international         law, there is considerable doubt whether it also covers         those the use of whioh is forbidden  by international         law.   And thereupon It was represented to  us by the         Admiralty and the War Offloe that they require a supply of
poison gas - an unlawful Instrument- o not only forexperimental purposes but also for stock with a.view., to possible retaliation, and that this cannot reasonably beprovided by the Government Arsenals and aust thereforebe obtained from Private Manufacture.     The question therefore has arisen;  VUsat course oughtour representatives at Geneva to adopt?   If the draft is allowed to stand, our fighting departments must eitherabandon their practice as to poison gas or we could notsign the Report In good faith.   If the draft is not to stand then what amendment should be attempted?     It appears that the only amendment which wouldbe practicable is one cutting all reference to instruments of war forbidden by International law out of the Reporton the ground that to prohibit the manufacture ofinstruments like&apos;gas for use in war which ex concessiscan be employed quite innocently for use in commerce can never be watertight, and Is therefore worse than futile.I have been of course unable to authorise amendedinstructions to this effect without the sanction of theForeign Secretary and the Cabinet, beoause of the implicationswhich such action by our representatives might involve.It would amount to an avowal that the British government intends to maintain a store of poison gas ^&quot;or possible use in war.   It is true that without this store we should beat a disadvantage if a potential enemy does not play fair.On the other hand the use of poison gas is in e^Tect fca^txLdL-d&amp;n.by the Treaty of Versailles, and it is obvious that the example of Great/
Britain would be e^n^rally followed and this provisionof     Treaty forbidding the use of gas would be gravely compromised.   It is also obvious that thispolicy might have serious reactions upon Britishpublio opinion.   It is thus exceedingly difficult todecide between the alternatives of either abandoning the precautionary provision of poison gas,  or rendering theprohibition&apos;of the Treaty abortive and  alarming, evonestranging, public opinion.   On the whole the majorityof those of ny colleagues directly interested whom Ihave been able to consult aro in favour of this second alternative,  and I append a draft telegram to our representatives prepared in the foreign Office whichwould carry It out.    Tho minority are  not convinced.          It has occurred to me sinoo to ask whether a middle course would not be possible, viz. to allow thedraft to go through tho Committee, so far as we aroconcerned, as it stands with all its sins upon its head,and between now and the tine when it comes before theAssembly to arrive at a decision on this difficult issuewith due deliberation not possible at this moment for action at that stags.                *                               . .

APPENDIX.PRIVATE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS, AMMUNITION AND-I^^^^^HMl 1------ DRAFT *F FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS TO MR. CADOGAN, BRITISH DELEGATE ON THE SPECIAL COMMISSION OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS W THE PRIVATE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS, AMMUNITION       AND IMPLEMENTS OF WAR.     Further consideration has been given to the question of theeffect of the present wording of the draft Convention relating tothe Private Manufacture of Arms upon the manufacture of arms and implements *vf which the U30 Is prohibited In timo of war.   the wording of the. present draft is such that It3 meaning Is obscure,and upon any matter which touches upon  our security we cannot accept a draft convention of which the interpretation i3 uncertain.You should therefore endeavour to secure the elimination of allreference to these prohibited arms.   Unless the drafting isrevised we cannot be oertain that other States will take the same view of the effect of the provisions as we do.   We prefer not  to propose a new draft or t^ discuss in detail the interpretatlcnof the existing draft because of. our desire not to draw attentionto the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound to securethemselves against the possible use of gas by their adversaries by being in a position to retaliate.     We leave the actual choice of arguments in favour of the elimination of all reference to prohibited arms to your discretion,but we should like you to make it plain that we consider the exist-ing draft an unsatisfactory because it is not water-tight, that no
one State can accept obligations not to manufactureproh.bited arras; etc. unless It knows that itspotential adversaries accept the same obligations andinterpret them in the same sense as it does) and unlessthereby it feels sure that the prevention of themanufacture of these prohibited arms will be universal.If auoh prohibition of manufacture is to be universalit should apply equally to state and private manufacture and should prevent all manufacture except for purposes other than use in war.     To achieve this purpose Is outside the scopeof the proposed conventlrn and would entail aseparate conference.
