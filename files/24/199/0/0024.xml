Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.   28CP. 374  (28).CABINET.Irish  Free State.CONTEMPLATED ISSUE OF TRUSTEE STOCK IN LONDON.     MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR  DOMINION AFFAIRS.    THE point raised in the Treasury memorandum (CP. 366 (28)) regarding theeffect of  the third condition laid down by the Treasury under the Colonial StockAct, 1900, raises  a constitutional  question  of. some difficulty.  As indicated inparagraphs 4 and 5 of that memorandum, this question is one of those which willhave to be considered at the Expert Committee which is to meet (according to present plans)  next autumn  in consequence  of  the  recommendations of the  ImperialConference of 1926.  It may be of interest to mention here that the proposal to setup this Expert Committee arose during the  course of discussions at the ImperialConference, in which this very question of the &quot; disallowance &quot; condition laid downby the Treasury under the Colonial Stock Acts was mentioned.  The point was raised in a memorandum submitted by the Irish Free State delegation, which, after drawing attention to the then existing practice of notifying Dominion Governments that HisMajesty would not be  advised to exercise his power of disallowance  in  respect ofDominion Acts, stated that &apos;&apos; those powers of veto are obsolete and should be formallyabandoned.&quot;&quot;  In discussing this memorandum at a meeting  of the Inter-imperial relations Committee  of the Imperial  Conference, I  mentioned the question  of trustee Stocks  and stated that &quot; if the practice of disallowance were  discontinued,it would be necessary  to consider what condition could be substituted for this asregards future loans,  in order  not to  deprive the securities in question  of  the privileges which they  enjoyed.   In the case  of existing loans, the condition was definitely attached and could not be modified.&quot;    In practice, it seems to me very  doubtful whether it would be possible to use thepower of disallowance  even in circumstances to which the third Treasury conditionis applicable.   On the other hand,  it is the  fact that  it is  not possible expresslyto waive that condition in respect of loans already issued which have been giventrustee status on the basis of acceptance of that condition.    On this point, however, it may not be out  of place to mention that, so  far as theDominions Office records show, there is no information that any formal compliance with the third condition has ever been made by the Commonwealth of Australia.    I agree that, as suggested in the Treasury memorandum, it is  not possible towithdraw the third condition until  the  whole question has been fully explored inconjunction with the other analogous issues  at the forthcoming Meeting of the expert committee and  at  the Meeting of the Imperial Conference, which will presumablypronounce on the Committee&apos;s conclusions.    I would, however, suggest that the Treasury memorandum goes too far insaying  that the existing third condition is  &quot; pivotal and, so far as  can be seen,.irreplaceable.&quot;  For the reason stated above, the practical value of the condition is-.very doubtful.   It could only be  invoked if and when legislation had been passed in a Dominion which clearly was a flagrant violation of the  contract between theDominion Government and their stockholders,  and if  the Dominion  Government-      [18548]
declined to take  steps to repeal or  modify that legislation.  In  such an event, a constitutional crisis of the first magnitude would unquestionably arise,  and anyattempted use of the power of disallowance would almost certainly not assist in itssolution.    On the other hand, it is  at least not impossible to conceive a state of affairs inwhich, as the result of agreement between the United Kingdom and the Dominions,confirmed by mutual  legislation, securities of any one part of the Empire wouldbecome trustee securities in  all;  and  in the  course of the negotiations leading tosuch an agreement  it  is not impossible to suppose that some more  satisfactory formof safeguard could  be devised than that imposed by the present third condition.    I would suggest that the best course to follow in this case would be to explain the present position to  Free  State Ministers when they come to London early thismonth for  the proposed conference  on questions arising out of Article  X of  theArticles of Agreement.   It would appear to be undesirable to convey our inability to waive condition (c), through the Governor of the Bank of Ireland.                                    1                               L. S. A.&apos;Dominions Office, Downing Street,      December 3, 1928.
