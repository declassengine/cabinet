 I    .                                                             it if (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY PIT  HIS BRITANNIC majesty*S GOVERNMENT).SECRET         .                                              0&quot;    :                                                 COPY HO.     3&apos;CP.  584 ( 8).                                      ^                            CABINET.                         NAVY ESTIMATES  1929.             Memorandum by the Eirst lord of the Admiralty.                I feel sure that the Cabinet will agree that  no good      purpose can be served by a decision that Navy Estimates for 1929      should  show suoh a  reduction as it is  absolutely out of my power,      and I am confident  out of the power of anyone responsible for      the Navy,  to effect  in them.                I am hopeful of reaching figures well  below those of      the last four  years quoted by the  Chancellor  in  C.P.376 (28).      But the reduction of  2,750,000 which  he suggests is beyond the      bounds  of possibility.                The  following is a brief statement  of  the  principal      causes  why Navy Estimates have  been higher in the last  four years      than in 1924,  and of the  financial effect of  each cause.           (1)  The  increased expenditure on New Construction.                     In 1924          7.27 millions                     In 1928          9.62 millions                The  major part  of  the cost of  the 5 Cruisers  and 2 De3-         troyers laid down by the  late Government in 1924  has been borne          by    the present Government end we  are  still carrying out our  own          New Construction Programme,  adopted  in 1925  with the  full,.know-          ledge  that it necessitated considerable expenditure.           (2)  The  transfer of the  cost  of  the Fleet  Air  Arm from                Air  Estimates to&quot;Navy Estimates.                     In 1924         . Nil                     In 1928          1  million           (3)  The  automatic rise  of the Non-Effeetive  Votes which                must still continue  for  some years  to  come.                     In 1924          8  millions                     In 1928          8.47 millions           (4)  The  re-adoption of the Singapore  Scheme  suspended                by the&apos; late  Government.                     In 1924         Nil                     In 1928          0.23,millions.
        The increase would have been much greater but forthe influence of Various counteracting factors  :-the modification of the New Construction Programme following the Geneva Conference; falls in prices and wages affectingsome parts but, by no means the whole of Naval expenditure;Dominion and Colonial contributions towards Singapore;and last but not least the application of num&amp;S?ousadministrative economies.         To illustrate this point I would call attention tothe difference between the Naval expenditure of the last fouryears and that whioh it was at one time contemplated would follow from the adoption of the New Construction Programme,and which is set forth in the Chancellor of the Exchequer1sMemorandum CP.260 (25) :-                     Mr. . Churchill&apos;s           Actual.                       forecast.                        million                 f million1925                 60.S                      601926                 61.23                     57.141927     &apos;            61.82                     58.121928     &quot;           64.6                      57.2                                            (Estimate)1929                 65.94          I do not by any means claim for the  Admiralty the sole credit for the whole of this great  reduction in the figures which were thought reasonable in 1925,  but I do claim that we have given the very fullest effect  to  the Prime Minister1s undertaking that &quot;the Admiralty  would make &quot;every endeavour by effecting substantial reductions upon&quot;the Navy to diminish the extra cost  of the New  Construction&quot; (statement in the House of Commons 23rd  July  1925).         As regards 192 9, I and my Board  are continuing thes6
its        endeavours,  and  I have  every  hope  of  reaching figures        showing  a reduction  of  something like   1,000,000.   In       -finding  way?  and mean a  of  effecting reduction?,  we  have  had        the  advantage  during the year of a very large number of        suggestion^  from the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the        Treasury, all  of which  have been very  carefully  examined,        and  many of which have  been of assistance.                 The  Chancellor of the Exchequer bases  hi* hope.*i        of a very much greater  reduction on             (&quot;a)  the  Cabinet1 s adoption for  the purposes of                 the  Estimates of the Fighting Services, of                 the  hypothesis that at any  given  date&quot;there                 will be no major war for 10  year:??,  and             (b)  the  Kellogg Pact.                 In  so far  as  we  can see  our  way to  economic a        from these two factors  we have made every endeavour to give        effect to them.   But I would point out that  only by        change:;  in the policy of His  Majesty1;? Government can they        lead to  any really large reduction in  Naval expenditure.        for  instanceshould the Cabinet decide to  abandon  the one-        power standard, with, say, a  consequent scrapping of our        building programme, no  doubt  large&apos;economies  would  be        possible.  Or, again, by the  abandonment of the  Singapore        Base something substantial could be saved.    But in the        sphere of administrative economies there remains now very        little scope  for scaling down, and without  some  precise        decision c-n Naval policy by the Government  such  as  I have        indicated, which could  not be  effected without consulting        the  Dominions  who at the last  Imperial Conference endorsed        our  Naval policy, the reduction of approximately  1,000,000        is the utmost  that I can hope  to realise next  year.                                        C *B.fimiralty, S.W. 1.,        December 6th,  1988.                                -?2-
