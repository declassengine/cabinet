Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    28CP,  372 (28).                                 CABINET.,COMPENSATION FOR IRISH LOYALISTS.       CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    IT will be remembered that at their meeting on the 15th February last theCabinet decided (Cabinet 7 (28), Conclusion&apos; 5)-         &quot;That the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be authorised to make an    announcement (the terms of which he would himself draw up)  in the House of    Commons to the general effect that,  on the basis of the awards already assessed    by the Wood Renton Commission, the Government have been led to believe that    a sum of one million pounds will cover in full the total claims, including those    remaining to be assessed; but that they are unwilling to be committed  to con-    tinued expenses in this connection,  or to  surrender their responsibility in the    matter; that, in the circumstances,  they propose to hold, one million pounds as    available for these payments, and for the present to pay a substantial percentage    (to be fixed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer) of all claims already dealt with,    the balance (if any) of the million pounds,  after payment of the said percentage    of all awards, being held available for payment of the whole,  or at any rate a    part, of what is still outstanding to complete each payment.&quot;    The  statement drafted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was approved by theCabinet (Cabinet 8 (28), Conclusion 7) on the 17th February, and was made in theHouse of Commons.on the 20th February.  The following is  an extract from that statement:-          ,,,                     &apos;         &quot;It now appears from all the  evidence we have been able to collect that    the total compensation which may be recommended by the Wood Renton Com-    mittee,  including  the  payments &quot; already  made,  may  be  approximately     1,000,000.  In these circumstances, the Government  have  examined  very    closely the principles which have guided the Committee in making their  recom-    mendations.  They have come to the conclusion that the Committee&apos;s work has    been done at every stage with a due regard  to the interests of the general  public,    and that the recommendations cannot be considered excessive.  They have also   : satisfied themselves that  the drastic scaling down of these recommendations    would inflict in numerous cases severe, unmerited hardship upon individuals,    which hardship might  reflect upon  the sincerity with which the Government    have given effect to the undertakings of their predecessors.       . It remains impossible for any  Government in a  matter of this kind  to  &quot; commit itself to a liability without limits.   I therefore take this opportunity, of-    stating that an increased, sum. not exceeding  1,000,000 will be held  available    as required in satisfaction of these claims.        All awards up to  1,000 will at once be paid in full.  Of  the excess over    this figure, 60 per cent., will be advanced immediately.   The residue  of  the     1,000,000 will be applied to the recommendations at  the close of the Inquiry    in so far as they have not already been implemented.....    1    I should add  that this decision  must be.  taken  as final so  far as  His    Majesty&apos;s  present advisers-are concerned.&quot; ..    No debate was permitted on this statement, but a Supplementary Estimate tomeet the&apos;additional expenditure involved  was introduced on the 23rd February,  and      [18539]  f                                                     B
in the debate on that Estimate I stated, inter alia, that the Government had decidedto allot a sum of  1,000,000      &quot;which we believe will be sufficient to enable us to carry out those recommenda-     tions in full, or at the very worst will involve only a slightly smaller allocation     in  respect of the larger recommendations.....  Certainly, the belief  that I     have been able to arrive at after scrutiny of  the facts is that we shall come Out     very close indeed to  1,000,000; but I should not be in the least surprised if     we came out at a figure definitely below that amount.  In these Circumstances,     while  I  entirely  sympathise  with  the  resolution  and  the  devotion  which     Honourable Members have shown in this House  .... I should be inclined to     advise them to hold their hand and await the outcome of the Committee&apos;s recom-     mendations.  I do not believe  that when those recommendations are complete     my Honourable Friends will have any reason for disappointment.&quot;     In reply to a question by Mr. Tinker, I repeated that          &quot; Our estimate is that  1,000,000 will cover all the claims if paid in full &quot; ;and in  closing the debate, I added,  with reference to some observations by ColonelGretton, that-         &apos;&apos; I know that some of my Honourable Friends feel some doubt as to what     the position may be in the final outcome of the Commission^ Eeport.  I agree     with my Right Honourable and Gallant Friend the member for Burton that he     has every right to reserve to himself the position that if he is not satisfied  ....     he will be entitled to raise  the matter again,  but I genuinely and  sincerely hope     and believe that that contingency will not arise.&quot;     It  will be seen from the above that the position,  as understood both in Parlia-ment and by the public generally, is      (a.) That the Government had allotted a sum for the payment of compensation           to Irish loyalists which they believed would be sufficient to meet in full the           recommendations of the Wood Renton Committee;     (b.) That the Government  would regard  any drastic scaling down of those           recommendations as likely to reflect upon the sincerity with which they           have given effect to the  undertakings of their predecessors;     (c.) That the Government have expressly declined to commit themselves  to the           payment in full  of the Committee&apos;s recommendations  whatever the           amount of those recommendations may be;     (d.) That,  should the money provided by  the Government not be sufficient to           meet the Committee&apos;s recommendations in full, Colonel Gretton and those           who  act with him will certainly not  acquiesce in any decision to pay less           than the full amount, but will reopen  the whole matter, notwithstanding           the  closing  paragraph  of the  Chancellor&apos;s  statement  on the  20th           February.                     &apos;     The information on which the  Cabinet based its decision in February, and onwhich the statements by the Chancellor and myself were made in Parliament, wasthe best available at the  time;  but I regret to find, from  the latest reports whichI have received from the Committee, that it is now clear that the sum of  1,000,000will not be  sufficient to meet in full the recommendations of the Committee, and,indeed, that it will probably require from  50,000  to  70,000, in  addition to the 1,000,000 already provided, to meet those recommendations even on  the scale laiddown in the statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer quoted above (i.e., up to 1,000  in full and 60 per cent,  of the excess over   1,000).   It is now estimated thatthe total recommendations of the Committee may amount to  about   1,400,000, andit is by no means impossible that they may exceed this sum.     I wish at this point to make it clear that I  do not feel able  in any way to  blamethe Irish Grants Committee or their staff for the fact that the estimates on whichthe Cabinet have based successive decisions in  this matter have proved inaccurate.Those estimates  have necessarily been based on the only possible assumption, namely,that the results of the work completed by the Committee from time to time will  affordsome indication of the probable results of the  work remaining to be completed.Unfortunately, such is the variety in the nature of the hardship  suffered by theloyalists and in the circumstances of the sufferers, that this  assumption has  at nostage proved  to be correct.  Furthermore, it was necessary,  in  answer, to strong pressure in the House  of Commons, to extend the final  date  for  the submission of
claims, originally fixed,  by  the  Committee as the 31st January, 1927, to the 28th;February last, and this  extension of date produced no fewer than 1,100  additionalclaims, a considerable proportion of which, I understand, appear on preliminary examination to be good.    Finally, it is to be  borne in mind that the  total number of claims  before theCommittee is  comparatively small, SO&apos; that,  in addition, to the  considerationsmentioned above, any estimate  of future awards based on past decisions is liableto be seriously thrown out by even a single large case.  Among the claims waiting to be dealt with are two  for  250,000 and  180,000 respectively.  There are grounds for anticipating that no award will be made in either case, and the estimate of 1,400,000 mentioned above is based on this assumption, among others :  it will be appreciated that if, contrary to expectation, a substantial recommendation is madein either or both  of these cases, that  estimate will be falsified.  As an example of thedifficulty of estimating what the result of any large claim.may be, I may mentiona recent case in which the claim was for  151,000; the recommendation of a valueremployed by the  Committee was  4,000;  the estimate of the Committee&apos;s secretary was from  12,000 to  16,000; and  the recommendation which I have now  receivedfrom the Committee is   29,500.  I have carefully  examined  this case,  and I am bound to say that on the evidence submitted at the actual hearing, the Committee&apos;recommendation  did not seem to me  to be at all excessive. Payment has accordingly been made on the authorized scale.    I should also like again to make it clear that it is not,  and never  has been, anypart of the Committee&apos;s duty in  any way  to attempt to equate the  total  of  their recommendations with the amount of money which they knew  from time  to  time tobe available for  the purpose  of meeting those  recommendations.  Their  duty, as I pointed out very clearly in  the  House of Commons, has been solely 1&apos;  to advise HisMajesty&apos;s  Government in each case, taking into account  the degree of hardshipsuffered by the claimant, whether in addition to any grants or compensation alreadyawarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government or by the Government of the Irish  Free Stateunder any statutory enactments or otherwise, any further ex gratia grant should inreason and fairness be made to the claimant by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and if so what should be the amount of such grant.&quot;  I am fully satisfied that the Committeehave performed and are performing their task in strict compliance with the letter and spirit of their terms of reference, and  that,  as stated by the Chancellor of thethe Exchequer, they have had at every stage due regard to the interests of the general public, and that their recommendations have not been excessive.   That is the onlymeasure of-economy that we are entitled to ask of them.    The Government is, of  course, fully pledged  to payment on the present scale inrespect of  alFthe Committee&apos;s recommendations.   As stated above,  payment  on this scale is now estimated to require some  50,000  to  70,000 in addition  to the sum of 1,000,000 already provided. In  view of the statements made to  Parliament bothby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself, there can be no question of a furtherscaling down of the future recommendations (all the recommendations  already madehave already been met on the approved scale), and I have therefore no option but to propose to the Treasury that an additional sum should be included in next year&apos;estimates.  The  exact figure  to be included must, I think,  be left over till the lastpossible moment.  Provisionally, it may be put at  60,000.    It remains to consider whether  we are prepared to stop at this point. It is, ofcourse, true.that,  when the  Chancellor of the Exchequer made his  statement inFebruary last, he made it clear that the decision then announced was final.  But when that statement was made the Government believed, and so informed Parliament, thatthe money to be provided would be sufficient to meet all the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions in full or,  at the very worst,  that it would only be necessary to make a verysmall  deduction  from the biggest awards.  If we announce, as we should have to announce not later than the end of the financial year (by which date it  is hoped thatthe Committee will finish their work), that we can only pay 60 per cent, of the excess over  1,000 in all recommendations exceeding  1,000, there is  certain to be anoutcry in  Parliament and in the Press.  I would therefore  ask  my  colleagues toconsider whether they are prepared to face that outcry or whether, in the alternative,they are prepared to sanction  the inclusion in next year&apos;s estimates of the additional sum  (over and above the sum  referred to above as being necessary to completepayments  on  the  present  scale)  for  the  purpose  of  paying  the  Committee&apos;srecommendations in full.  What this sum would be I hesitate to say at .the moment,but it may be tentatively  estimated at  350,000.   There is, of  course, a thirdpossibility, namely, to adhere to the principle of a fixed sum, but to  increase that      [18539] ;  &quot;                                                    B 2
fixed sum, and, after payment of all recommendations on the present scale, to&apos; apply the balance to the payment of a further dividend on all recommendations over  1,000.The objection to this course is; that if the figure is seriously below payment in full,we shall be again faced with the same problem; if it is only slightly below, we shallbe urged not to spoil the moral effect of our action for a trifle.    It may assist my colleagues to appreciate the  position if I summarise the resultsof the cases already examined by the Committee,  with the warning that it does not follow that  results at  all similar will emerge from their  recommendations in thecases which they have not yet examined.    Of the 2,623 cases already examined, the Committee have made recommendations in  1,300,  or 50 per cent.;  the applications  in  the  remaining cases having been rejected.                                                               .....-    Of these 1,300 recommendations, 1,066, or 82 per cent., were for amounts lessthan  1,000;  all these recommendations have  been paid in  full.    Of the remainder, 60  were for sums  between  1,000 and  1,500,  and the applicants in these cases have  received on an  average 91 per cent, of  the. sumsrecommended; 86 were for sums between  1,500 and  3,000, and the applicants havereceived on an average 80 per cent.; 42 were for  sums between  3,000 and  5,000,and the applicants have received on an average 70  per cent.; 32 were for  sumsbetween  5,000 and  7,500, and the applicants have received on an average 67 percent.; and 14 were for sums in excess of  7,500, and the applicants have received onan average 63 per cent.    It will thus be seen that of the recommendations already made by the Committee,82 per cent,  have  already been paid in full.  In an appendix to this memorandum Ihave given a summary of a few typical cases from among the 18 per cent, who havereceived less than  the  full amount recommended  by the  committee, so that mycolleagues may be in a position to form some judgment as to the amount of hardshipwhich would be involved in adhering to the present scale.    It seems to me that the arguments in  favour  of payment in  full on the onehand, and of adhering to  the  present  scale on the other,  may be summarised asfollows:     (A.) In favour of payment in full it may be said that:    (i.)  It would finally dispose of the question of compensation for Irish loyalists.          While it would  still, of course, be the case that the  disturbances in          Ireland  from 1916 onwards had  caused  grievous suffering  for which no          adequate compensation,  and  in many  cases no compensation at all, had          been or  could be  given, yet  it could  never again be alleged  that His          Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain  had not done all that  could          reasonably be required of them to assuage that suffering.    (ii.) In  so far as we fall short of paying the Committee&apos;s recommendations in          full,  it  can and  will  always be  alleged against us,  and  with  much          justification, that we have failed to carry out  solemn pledges made by          successive British Governments to those who suffered by reason of their          loyalty to the Crown.    (iii.) It will  be pointed out that the persons chiefly affected, namely, those in          whose favour recommendations exceeding,  say,  3,000 have been made,          are  to a considerable extent  precisely those persons who  have suffered          most from the operation of the Irish  Free State Land Act.  It will be          remembered  that it  was in  connection with that Act that a Select          Committee of the House of Lords reported (on what I consider to be very          insufficient grounds see my memorandum to the Cabinet CP. 19 (27) of          the  21st January, 1927) that we had failed to fulfil  pledges given by          Ministers.    (iv.) Having spent approximately  8,000,000 in  all on Irish compensation, it          is not worth while, for the sake  of saving, say,  350,000  (large though          that sum may be), to incur the inevitable odium (especially on the eve of          a General Election) which would result from failure to pay in full.    (B.) In favour of adhering to the present scale, it may.be said that     (i ) It was made abundantly clear in the House of Commons in February last          that the allocation of  1,000,000 was  final, and that this sum wouldbe          spread out, on a carefully thought out scale, over the recommendations          of the Committee, whatever those recommendations might be.
        By paying the smaller recommendations (up to  1,000) in full, we have, in          fact, relieved the  great bulk of distress remaining after the operation          of  the various statutes  and  administrative measures  for  affording.          compensation.        Those persons in whose  favour the Committee have made recommendations          exceeding  1,000 and who are receiving the sums recommended subject          to  a  scale  reduction varying from 10  per cent,  to something  over          30  per cent., are  only  being called upon to share the burden of  loss          necessarily and inevitably arising  out of civil war,  which is being borne          by many thousands who have received and will receive no compensation          at all.        We have  made every effort consistent with the state of  our finances to meet          the hardship and loss arising out of a great constitutional change, and it          would  be unfair to place on  the taxpayer of this country the burden of          finding yet a further considerable sum, having regard to the amount          already expended in assisting the Irish loyalists.    It is, I think, unnecessary for me to say how greatly I should welcome a decisionof my colleagues to find the additional sum required and to pay these recommenda-tions in full.   The third course indicated above, namely, that of adhering to a fixedsum, but increasing  that sum by  a substantial amount, would, indeed, have  theadvantage  of  maintaining  a principle  which was enunciated  very  clearly inParliament, but would otherwise  be  open to objection for reasons which I havealready  explained.  If,  therefore, we leave out of consideration the financial aspect,I am bound to say that the balance of argument turns very definitely,  in my opinion,in favour of payment in full.  I recognise, however,  the urgent need for economy,and the question  is essentially one for determination by the Cabinet on grounds ofgeneral  policy. I would only say that I feel that whatever decision Ave  now reachmust be a final decision; the worst course of all would be to announce a decision,  andsubsequently, under pressure,  to retreat from that position.

APPENDIX.SUMMARY OF SOME TYPICAL CASES IN WHICH THE COMMITTEE&apos;S RECOMMENDATION                               EXCEEDS   1,000.        (A.) Recommendations for Amounts between  1,000 and  3,000.    (1.)  Case No. 2613.-Applicant is a  widow aged 35.  Her father was game-keeper to a well-known Unionist landowner, and her husband,  whom she marriedin June 1922, was a strong loyalist, and owned a farm of 50 Irish acres.    Between June 1922 and May 1923 the  farm was raided on several occasions,damage to the amount of  60 or  70 being done.  In addition,  in March  1923applicant and her husband were both knocked off their bicycles by a mob and injured.    In May 1923 applicants husband, owing  to  continuous boycott and threats,decided to sell his farm, which he and his father  had owned for many years andwhich they bad greatly improved.   He sold farm and stock at a heavy loss andbought a smaller farm elsewhere.  On the day he left his old farm he was deliberatelyrun over by a motor car and was badly injured.    In the same month raiders entered the house of applicants  father and stole orbroke property (wedding presents,  &amp;c.) belonging to her and  temporarily storedthere, of  the value of  60.    In March 1924 applicants husband left  home to attend a cattle show in Dublinand was  never seen again.   In  1926 applicant received an  anonymous letter,purporting to come from her husband&apos;s murderer, saying that her husband had been shot in 1924 and his body burned.  Applicants  child was born six months after herliusband&apos;s disappearance.  It was a delicate child and lived only  fourteen months.    Applicant is now living with her mother on the farm bought by her late husband.She is in very poor circumstances and has  received   50 from the Southern IrishLoyalists Association.    The  applicant claimed   2,400,  and the Committee recommended  a grant  of 1,500.   This recommendation excluded any consideration of the loss occasioned bythe death of her husband;  but  this loss will form the subject of a later recommenda-tion if necessary.    In accordance with the  scale,  the recommendation of the Committee has  been met by a payment of  1,300.    (2.) Case No. 1262. Applicant is the proprietor of a garage  in Dublin, aged 57.He built his garage out of accumulated profits in 1913, and in 1920 his assets exceededhis liabilities by  5,000, and in that year he made a profit of   3,000, his annualprofits prior to the war having been from  800 to  1,200.  Applicant joined theArmy in 1916, and had always been an outspoken loyalist.    Immediately  after the withdrawal of the  British troops from the Irish  FreeState  applicant found  that  his old customers  were nervous of  dealing with him,and, while he cannot prove a boycott,&apos; he lost nearly all his business.  In 1921 he hada loss of  800, in 1923 of  400 and in 1924 of  400.   Since then he has made a profit of about  250 per annum.  He owes  his bank  4,000 and has no means of paying this amount.    The applicant made no specific claim,  and the Committee recommended a grantof  2,000, and in submitting this recommendation expressed the view that, inasmuch as such a grant would be made entirely in respect of capital loss, it should, if possible,be paid in full.    In accordance with the  scale, the recommendation has been met by a paymentof  1,600.    (3.)  Case No. 2441. Applicant is an unmarried woman,  aged 65,  owner  of aproperty consisting of a house and  175 acres which she  inherited from her father.She was accustomed to let the greater part  of her land, and the rents constituted hersole income.  From 1921 onwards she was rigidly boycotted and derived no income-from the land except  350 in 1923.  During this time she had to pay head rent,  rentcharge, rates, &amp;c, and for this purpose sold her jewellery, &amp;c,  and mortgaged theproperty.  She is now endeavouring to sell the property,  on which she has placed areserve of  3,500, having refused  8,000 for  it before the boycott.  Her presentincome amounts to  11, derived from the letting of a small portion of the property,and she is in debt to the extent of  300.
    The applicant claimed  4,700, and the Committee made a recommendation oi 2,030.  In accordance with the scale,1 this has been met by a payment of  1,618:     (4.) Case No. 2259.-The applicant is  aged 52; a Protestant and&apos;loyalist, andwas employed as caretaker of evicted farms. He bought one of the farms (65 acres)in 1914 for  150 subject to an annuity payable to the Land Commission of  22, andstocked and improved it.    From 1918 until the date of the Truce his cattle were driven or stolen on various occasions, and he was kidnapped to prevent him from giving evidence in his claim for compensation.  In  respect of these injuries, he received compensation from theShaw Commission.    On the 10th March, 1922, he was kidnapped, but was released by Police after two days.    On the 16th March, 1922,  he was again kidnapped and was ordered to  leaveIreland forthwith under penalty of death.   He remained in hiding in Limerick, butin April 1922 his wife and children were turned out of the farm and ordered not toreturn.   They joined him in Limerick, and the family finally came to England inOctober 1922.  Since then he has been- casually employed in  England; he receivesno income from his farm, which he cannot  sell.  The farm will probably shortly be sold by the Land Commission for arrears of  annuity.    The applicant claimed  9,000, and the Committee in  December  1927 recom-mended a.grant of  2,200.  On the scale then  authorised (i.e-., the Sumner scale)he was entitled on this to a payment of  985,  less  300 already advanced to him.He declined to accept the cheque for  685.  When the existing scale came into forcehe was paid  1,420 (i.e.,  1,720, less  300 already, advanced).    (5.) Case iVc&apos;1893. Applicant is a specialist in electro-therapy, aged 56.  Hehad practised in Kingstown since 1905, his average annual net income being from 400 to  500.  In April 1921 he opened a nursing home there at a cost of  .1,500,and until 1922 (when  the British troops left the Irish Free State) it was highly successful.  He was well known locally as a loyalist: From September 1922 the house was boycotted; patients entering and leaving were warned not,to attend again, andapplicants correspondence  was opened so that intending patients could be orderednot to employ him.  From September 1922 applicant saw no  patients at all, and inApril 1923 he sold the house in Kingstown for  500 and set up practice in England.His present living is very precarious, and he  has had to borrow  600 to cover removaland living expenses and to set up his new house.                  .        . .    The applicant claimed  4,600, and the Committee recommended  a grant of 2,500.  In accordance with the scale, the applicant has received  1,900. ,    (6.) Case No. 2135.-Applicants are  mother  (a widow) and daughter, whoowned a corn mill and 50 acres of land.  The husband was Chairman of the  localmagistrates until his1 death in 1922, and the daughter in 1922 became engaged to aBritish officer stationed in the Irish Free State  who had formerly been engaged inintelligence work.                   i-,                         ,       ,, -.  .,.    In September 1922 (i.e\, very, shortly after the British troops left) the house wasraided at night by seven or eight armed and masked, men.  In October 1922 the house was again raided.  On both occasions, both applicants, who were in their night dress,were threatened with revolvers and kept under guard in separate rooms.    As a result of the raids both applicants suffered in health, and the daughter.has had a serious breakdown and has been unable to marry.   They had to leave thecountry, and from 1923 onwards have derived no income from the mill or the land.The property is now heavily mortgaged, and most of the applicants&apos; investments have,been realised to enable them to live.                       .    The applicants claim  4,800.  The  Committee recommended a grant of  2,750,and in accordance with the scale the applicants have been paid  2,050.    (7.) Case No. 163. Applicant is a farmer-aged 61; owner  of a farm of 161 acres(subject to an annuity of  31), well stocked and with a good residence.  ;He.was wellknown locally as a loyalist.    In July 1922 armed men came to his house and under penalty of death orderedhim to sell  them the farm, with all stock, equipment and furniture, for  100, andhe had&apos;no alternative but to sign a paper agreeing to do so. , He was  then turned out with his wife and three children and arrived in England destitute. .    The old Irish Grants Committee made him a grant of  200 for living expenses,and subsequently advanced him   1,500-which, with a further loan of  1,500 fromthe Bank, enabled him to buy a farm in Kent.   The Irish Grants Committee also madea grant of  500 to stock the farm, and he is  now well established.
    The Dominions Office has had some correspondence with the Irish Free StateGovernment in this case.  In 1923 that Government stated that, as things then were,they could not advise the applicant to return and resume his farm.  They subsequentlycleared out the persons who occupied the farm  (the ringleader was later killed), andadvised the Dominions Office that there was now nO reason why the applicant shouldnot put the farm up for sale. He has done so, but owing to the past history of the farm,the highest offer yet received is  800.    Applicant owed  1,500 to the  Irish  Grants Committee and  1,500 to the Bank,and claimed  7,000.  . The Committee recommended  a grant of  3,000,  and, inaccordance with the scale, the applicant has been paid  2,200, from which theprevious advance has been deducted, leaving him a net  700.         (B.) Recommendations for Amounts between  3,000 and  8^000.    (8.)  Case No. 1477. Applicant is a general merchant and farmer, aged 78.  Hisshop was raided and looted seven  times,  and in  October 1921 boycott notices wereposted up in the town, with the result that he had eventually to close down his business in December 1922.    In  October  1921,  when the boycott notices were posted up, applicant waskidnapped, and, having been imprisoned  for four hours in total darkness, was fined 1,000 for having brought proceedings for debt in a British Court, for declining to resign his Commission of the Peace, and  for having spoken against Home Rule tenyears before. He refused to pay, and, as a result of being kept for eight days in asmall and verminous room, without any sanitary conveniences, and with three armedguards  constantly present, became seriously ill.  He was  eventually released  on payment of a ransom of  200.    Applicant has sold one of his three farms at a heavy loss.  He derives a smallincome from the other two,  but has totally lost  his business, the cash turnover ofwhich (certified by the Bank) was  8,600&quot;in 1919  and  8,300 in 1920, showing anet profit of approximately  500.  He has  an overdraft at  the Bank  of  800i    The applicant  claimed   6,800, and the Committee recommended a grant of 3,600.   In  accordance with the scale, applicant has received . 2,560.    (9.)  Case No. 97. Applicant  is a landowner, aged  59.  He frequently enter-tained British officers and declined to pay levies to the Republicans.   In 1921 and1922 his cattle were driven on a number of occasions and he suffered heavy loss.   InAutumn 1922 seventeen of  eighteen Republicans billeted themselves on him, doingmuch damage.  In November 1922 he decided to leave Ireland with his family and did so.  In January and February 1923 the house was raided and looted and, on thelast occasion, it was burnt down.  He was awarded  7,280 by the Free State courts in respect  of the burning,  of which  5,400 was subject  to  reinstatement;  the unconditional portion of the award has been paid.  By far the larger part of the applicants income was derived  from the profits of carrying on farming, and he hasbeen totally  deprived of this source of income  since 1922, with the result that he hasbeen living  on capital, and  his capital has now almost disappeared.  He intends,now that the country has settled down, to return to Ireland and work his lands asformerly.    The applicant claimed  12,700,  and the Committee recommended a grant of 4,000.   In  accordance with the scale, the applicant has been paid   2,800.    (10.) Case No.  87. Applicant, aged 71,  is the owner of a mansion and about,000 acres, of which he normally retained about 850  acres in his own hands andfarmed  himself.   From 1922 he was boycotted and could get no one to work for him,and, as  a result, lost all his crops for that year, and in the following years the landwent  out of  cultivation.  In July 1922 the mansion and contents were destroyed by fire.  Subsequently, he was warned to strip his land of cattle, or they would be taken.He therefore disposed of 180 head of stock (including  a  small  herd of pedigreeAberdeen Angus cattle) at a heavy loss.    In  respect of the destruction  of his house and  contents, applicant receivedawards  from the Free State Courts amounting  to  10,250,  of which  5,100 was subject  to reinstatement.  Applicant estimates the  cost of complete  reinstatement(i.e., of rebuilding a mansion similar to the one destroyed) at  22,500 ;  but as he doesnot intend to rebuild, he has sold the conditional award of  5,100 for  3,825;  the unconditional portion has been paid.
    The applicant appears to have received the rents for the tenanted portion ofhis land fairly regularly; for the untenanted portion  (850 acres) he has been offered 6,000 by the Land Commission, which he has accepted.    Applicant claimed in all  37,297, including  12,000 for the difference betweenthe  value of the mansion and the amount paid in compensation by the Free StateGovernment, and  5,500 for the difference between the value of the untenanted landsand the sum received therefor from the Land Commission.  The Committee recom-mended a grant of   7,945, and, in accordance with the scale,  5,167 has been paidto the applicant.             (C.)-Recommerudations for Amounts exceeding  8,000.    (11.) Case No.   164.-Applicants  are  a  Belfast  firm of  seedsmen  andnurserymen, holders of the Royal Warrant, who maintained a branch in Dublin.    In April 1922 a number of armed men, who styled themselves members of theI.R.A. Northern Boycott Committee, occupied the premises of the Dublin branch,announced that the business had been confiscated by the Republican Government,and proceeded to collect the book debts and sell the stock-in-trade.    The branch was re-established, with entirely new capital, amounting to  14,000,in January 1924.    A claim for compensation was  made to the Irish Free State Courts, and  an award of  8,800 was issued and paid.    The applicants claimed  24,400. This was based on the loss of estimated profitsfrom July 1921 to the date of hearing  (February 1928).   The average annual net profit of the Dublin branch for the  three financial years 1919, 1920  and 1921 wascertified by the auditors to be  4,740.    The Committee recommended a grant of  9,000, and, in accordance with thescale, the applicants have been paid   5,800.    (12.) Applicant,  aged 73, was the  owner of a castle, with a demesne of about340 acres, including a valuable salmon fishery.   A large sum of money (approxi-niately  30,000) had been expended by  the applicant on improving the Castle andgrounds.  The  premises were  raided about  100  times,  with  the result  that  theapplicant and his wife  suffered severely in health, and finally left Ireland and boughta small house in England.  In September 1922 the Castle and contents,  with all out-buildings, electric light plant, &amp;c, were destroyed by fire.    In the course  of the applicants claim for  compensation before the Free StateCourts, it was agreed  that the cost of reinstating the buildings destroyed would be 62,000. As the applicant had decided finally to leave Ireland, he did not apply fora &quot;full reinstatement&quot; award, and the Court awarded  25,000, which was dulypaid.    The applicant claimed  69,000, including   44,000 in respect of the differencebetween the cost of completely reinstating the Castle, &amp;c, and  the compensationreceived,  12,000 for the loss of the use  of the Castle,  and  9,000 for the loss of thecapital value  of the  sporting rights.   The  Committee  recommended a  grant of 25,575, and, in accordance with the scale, the applicant has received  15,745.
