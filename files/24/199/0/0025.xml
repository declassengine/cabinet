SECRET.                                                    Copy No.  28CP. 375  (28).PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF  A  TRADE  COMMISSIONER  POST                               AT  DUBLIN.     MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OE STATE  FOR DOMINION  AFFAIRS.    THE President of the Board of Trade has communicated to me a copy of thememorandum which he is circulating to the Cabinet on the subject of the proposed appointment of a Trade Commissioner at Dublin.  The arguments adduced by thePresident of the Board of Trade in his memorandum appear to me to be conclusiveas to the value of such an appointment from the commercial point of view.    Apart from this,  however, I should like to add that, from the political stand-point, it seems to me that there would be great advantage in such an appointmentbeing made.  I would emphasise the considerations mentioned in paragraph  3 offehe memorandum by the President of the  Board  of  Trade, that at present thiscountry has no representative of  any kind in the Irish  Free State, whereas, theUnited States of America have, for over a year, had a Minister at Dublin and, as aresult of the proposed appointment of an Irish Free State Minister at Berlin, theGerman Government are contemplating raising the status of their Consul-general at Dublin to  that  of  a Minister;  it seems most  probable also that the proposed appointment of an Irish  Free State Minister at Paris will  lead to  similar actionon the part of the French Government.    In the circumstances, I feel, not only that such an appointment  is most desirable in itself, but also that it is essential that  the holder of the post should be the most highly qualified officer  who can be secured,  and that the remuneration should be fixed on a scale which will render this possible.  It seems to me a  sine qua non that theofficer selected should be possessed of tact and social abilities, and that he should beprepared to entertain.  Given these qualifications I am convinced that such anofficer would be of the greatest value from the commercial point of view,  and could do most useful work in improving our relations with the Free State generally.                                                                  L. S.  A.Dominions Office, downing Street, S.W. 1,          December 3, 1928.[18551]               Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1928.
