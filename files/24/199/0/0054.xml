(This Document is the Property of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Pointed for the  Committee of Imperial Defence.  December 1928.SECRET.Copy No.   48COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 239th Meeting, held on December 13, 1928.    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chief ofthe Imperial  General  Staff  dealing  with the Military Situation  in  Germany(C.ID. Paper  No. 926-B).    LORD  SALISBURY  stated  that,  in his  capacity as  Chairman  of theSub-Committee dealing with  the Reduction and  Limitation  of  Armaments, his attention had  been arrested  by a letter by Professor Morgan in the &quot;Times.&quot;  Piedid not personally  know Professor Morgan, nOr  was  he aware  of  the extent ofreliance which, should  be placed  on Professor Morgan&apos;s words.   He understood,however, that  the: Professor had been a member  of the Military Commission inBerlin, and that, though he had severed his connection with that Mission in 1923, hehad still kept  in  touch with the situation and was at times consulted by the WarOffice on the subject. He therefore suggested that Professor Morgan&apos;s letter shouldbe brought to  the attention of the  War Office, and that they should be asked tosubmit  their observations.   The  present  Memorandum, was  the  outcome of  this request.  He did not propose to go through the paper, but merely to draw attentionto one or two salient points.    (i.) The Memorandum showed that the number of  fully trained men availablefor the German army  was  230,000,  but to  these must be added those  that  werepartially  trained,  which  brought  the total&apos; up to  approximately  4,000.000.Admittedly the numbers shown under the  heading &quot; partially trained &apos;&apos; includedmany different categories, but, having regard to the experience of the War: which went to prove  that, provided trained officers were  available,  partially trained menvery soon became effective, the estimate&apos; placing the  strength of the German army at,000,000 was  a matter which, in his opinion, called for serious consideration.  Ofcourse, it must be realised that among the partially trained were included men withcombatant war service,  and that, therefore, this potential  reserve was in the natureof a wasting asset.  But even if this  category was excluded,  the strength of theGerman army  remained at a figure  of  approximately 2,000,000 men.  This was a formidable figure in comparison with the 100,000 permitted by Treaty.    (ii.) The position in regard to armaments also was alarming.  It was obviousfrom the Memorandum that the Germans were evading their Treaty obligations, andwere including sums in their Estimates far in excess of those  permitted by theTreaty.  For example,  in Section 5  of the  Memorandum, it  was  shown that theexpenditure on small arms, machine guns and optical instruments  was 14-7 million marks in 1928-29, in comparison with 9-9 million marks in 1913-14.  This showed,approximately, an increase in expenditure amounting to 50 per cent.   Admittedly,some allowance must be  made for the  difference  in value of money, but it was significant that,  whereas in  1914 approximately 10,000,000 marks sufficed for anarmy 800,000 strong, the figure of 14-7 million marks in 1928 was for an army which by Treaty should not exceed  100,000 men.   The  difference in expenditure  thusdisclosed at once became significant, and was emphasised in the case of expenditureon artillery material.(1.)-THE  MILITARY SITUATION IN GERMANY.(C.I.D. Paper No. 926-B.)[18606-3]
    (iii.) Further, it would be noted from the Memorandum that under the TreatyGermany was allowed an annual expenditure of 25,000,000 rounds of  small  armammunition.   The amount allowed  in this year&apos;s Budget for this item was half amillion  pounds.   For a similar item  in our own Estimates we should only allot 150,000.   In effect, therefore, Germany, whose methods of provisioning her forces were normally no more extravagant  than our own, was allotting for  expenditure ona comparable item approximately  350,000 more than we should authorise.    (iv.) It was also to be observed that in  Germany sums unexpended  during thecurrent financial  year were allowed to  accumulate, and did not pass back to theExchequer, as was the system in this country.  It appeared, therefore, that germany was amassing,  for some sinister purpose, large  accumulations of  treasure or ofwarlike stores.  The points to which, he had drawn attention were only some of thosewhich were included in the Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.There were others also which  required attention,  particularly the centralisation ofthe chemical  industry, which would enable their products to be turned to military purposes in the shortest possible time.   He suggested with some diffidence that thefigures which had been put forward  in the Memorandum were in the nature of  con-servative estimates.  The figures given by Professor Morgan were much higher andassessed the strength of the German army at  approximately 9,000,000 men.   but no matter which of the figures was correct, it appeared evident that Germany wascreating a first reserve of considerable strength which could be employed, with hardlyany delay, on active operations.  At the end of his Memorandum the Chief of theImperial General Staff expressed an opinion that Germany was  not in a  position towage an aggressive war, the deciding factor  in this connection being the lack of thenecessary  armaments and equipment  rather than deficiencies in man-power.   Inthis connection Professor Morgan, while agreeing broadly in regard  to the numberof guns which were destroyed at the  end of the war, stated that he knew on thehighest authority that the Germans had got no less than 10,000 guns  concealed.  Hethought that it was of importance that the  Committee of Imperial Defence shouldtake all these matters into consideration.  The strength of the German army had adirect bearing on the work of the Preparatory Commission at Geneva  and the policy we should adopt in relation to that Commission.  It also had reactions in regard tothe attitude we should adopt towards  the United  States of America. He spoke onthis subject as one who earnestly desired  that no effort should be spared which mightprevent the occurrence of another war.  If,  in fact,  Germany was  rearming we shouldseriously consider what steps should  be taken before that  process  of rearmamentgathered too  great a momentum.    SIR RONALD LINDSAY said that he agreed with much  that was containedin the  Memorandum under consideration.  The German Budget was redolent withfraud,  and the figures contained therein were mere figures of speech.  It should beborne in mind, however, that the old  military system of Germany  was based upon themilitary ^caste.  That caste had been broken by the revolution which had taken place after the &quot;War.  The present Government of Germany was based  on the &quot; bourgeois &quot;class, of which Herr Stresemann was typical. The interest of this Government wasto re-establish the economic position of Germany;  it had no militaristic tendencies,and it  did not desire to see the military caste return to power.  Herr Stresemannhad said  passionately that  what Germany  wanted was not a levelling-up but alevelling-down of armaments.   It was  very difficult to foresee  what developmentswould take place,  but he thought it was safe to assume that Germany  would not wishto return to conscription, because such a return would mean  the resurrection of themilitary class.   He  suggested  that  the Foreign  Office should put forward  aMemorandum dealing with the political  aspects of this question.    SIR GEORGE MILNE  stated that  the estimates in  his  Memorandum were undoubtedly on the conservative side.   The French estimate of  the strength  of theGerman army was 7,000,000, while the Belgian estimate for actually trained men inthe Nationalist Associations exceeded  that of the French General Staff.   The WarOffice did not place any great reliance  on Professor Morgan&apos;s estimates, and did notbelieve  that Germany was possessed of hidden reserves of material  saved from thewar,  as Professor Morgan suggested.   But,  undoubtedly,   she was building upreserves for future use. At the same time, it must be realised that  the training ofthe bulk of her forces was beneath contempt.    SIR SAMUEL HO ARE said  that he  had recently had an opportunity of atalk with Marshal Lyautey, and had  gathered from this  conversation  that what
 France particularly feared was the air menace from Germany.  There were two views in regard to this menace.  The one, represented by public opinion in France, was that the menace was considerable, that Germany was the most air-minded of all European nations, that she possessed a vast network of aerodromes, that she propped up civil aviation concerns by means of generous subsidies,  and that, though in fact she had no military air service,  she had at  her disposal 2,000 civil pilots and  a flourishing aircraft industry.  The other view  was that civil aviation was  of little value for military purposes,  and that, though a large number of civilian  pilots  might  be in existence, these pilots were only trained to ferry  machines from point to point, and were unable to carry out the majority of duties required  of a military service.  In regard to aircraft,  the view was held that, as years went on,  the characteristics of civil and military aircraft would diverge more and more, and that, in course of time the former would be of little use for military purposes.  The  view held by the Air Staff lay midway between these two schools of thought.  The Air Staff did not accept the French view that the German civil air services constituted a considerable menace, nor did they hold  that  civil aviation was entirely devoid of  miltary  value.   The existence of a network of aerodromes was, in their view, of military value, while the existence of a considerable aircraft industry would enable the construction of military aircraft to be developed more rapidly than would otherwise be the case.  Similarly, although the average German civilian air pilot would be  no match for the British Service pilot, yet the existence of civil air transport companies would facilitate  the rapid procurement of personnel for a military air service.  While, therefore, the Air Staff  did not take  any  alarmist  view of the situation,  they  considered that  the development of  a German air service would not  present any very great difficulties in the event of  war, and, in his view, the Committee of  Imperial Defence should note that the organisation at present existing in Germany would enable an air service to be more rapidly  developed than if no  such civil  air organisation was in being. In the last paragraph of the Chief  of the Imperial General  Staffs Memorandum it was implied that, if the Preparatory Commission at Geneva  failed to promote a general limitation of  armaments, Germany&apos;-s  case  for rearming  herself would thereby be the stronger.   In  his view any claims by Germany to rearm, based on a failure to achieve general disarmament by means of the  Preparatory Commission, could not be justified by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. This country had gone a long way in reducing its armaments, and, in his opinion, it would be a mistake to adopt the view that a failure to reach agreement at Geneva on disarmament was a justification for Germany to rearm.    SIR RONALD LINDSAY said that he did not hold that Germany would be entitled to rearm, but the pressure of public opinion in  Germany would be such that efforts to evade the restrictions imposed upon her  by the Treaty would be increased, and thus, although the  situation de jure would remain  unchanged,  it would be altered de facto.    SIR LAMING WO&apos;RTHINGTON-E&apos;VANS  stated that both  Count Bernstorff and Herr Stresemann (as late as November last) had affirmed that a continuance of . the disarmed condition of Germany was  dependent  upon a  measure of general disarmament being adopted by other  Powers,  and quoted passages from speeches in support of this statement.    MR. AMERY held the view that  the extent to  which Germany had been disarmedwas surprising, and it was only natural that she should try and evade her obligations in this respect.  He  did not think that the facts disclosed in the Memorandum under discussion constituted any danger to ourselves, and  considered that we should notbe in  any way alarmed by them.    MR. CHURCHILL considered that there  was no cause for us to be alarmed atthe state of affairs in Germany, provided always that  France  maintained a strong army.  The peace of Europe was guaranteed by that army.  If the strength of  that army fell below a certain  point the peace of Europe would be jeopardised, and under the Locarno Treaty we should become  involved.    We should bear  in mind  thatoriginally a guarantee had been given to France in regard to her security, but, owingto the default  of the United States of America,  that guarantee was no longer operative.   Further, the males reaching military age each year in Germany would by 1932 be double those in France, and the French also had an unfriendly Italy on their flank.  Their position was, therefore, difficult, and they realised that  they had to rely largely upon their own strength  and be conciliatory to us.   For that reason we
^should not endeavour to reduce the strength of the French army.  That their fear wasa genuine one was evinced by the fact that they had recently allocated no less than 50,000,000 for expenditure on fortifications.  This was a purely pacific defensivemeasure.  It could not be directed aggressively against any Power.  It was a shieldfor their own protection.  It was adopted as an alternative to the guarantee whichhad disappeared owing to America&apos;s default. Admittedly the expenses of the Frencharmed forces had increased, but this was due largely to the increases of pay attendantupon the adoption of the system of one year rather than of three years&apos; service.   he urged that it should be our aim to do nothing which would reduce the strength of theFrench  army.    LORD SALISBURY said  that the most reassuring point was the view of theGeneral Staff that there was a great lack of training in&apos;the German army. He also accepted the view of the General Staff that there were no hidden arms in Germany.He suggested, however, that Professor Morgan might be approached with a view to ascertaining  who  was  the  &quot;highest  authority&quot;  on  whom  he  had  based&apos;  his information.    THE PRIME MINISTER  suggested that the  Memorandum under discussion,the Minutes of the meeting and the paper to be prepared by the Foreign Office onthe political  aspects of  the question  should be  submitted to  the Cabinet  for for consideration.                                 CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed-     (a.) To take note of the Memorandum by the  Chief  of the Imperial General          Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 926-B).    (&amp;.)

I circulate for the information of the Committee of Imperial Defence a memorandum   0154on the above subject which has been prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.   7031                                                                       L. W.-E,  THE WAR OFFICE,         6th December, 1928.                 1. RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY  THE PEACE TREATY.    I will first consider the military restrictions imposed upon Germany by the peace treaty.   These are briefly as follows :                                   (a) Effectives.    By the Treaty of Versailles the German Army is limited to a force of 4,000 officersand 96,000 other ranks  organized in  7  infantry and 3 cavalry divisions.   These aregrouped into 2 commands, dealing directly with the War Office (Reichswehrministerium).    Recruiting is by voluntary enlistment only, officers serving  for 25 consecutive years,other ranks for 12.  Reserve formations and all measures for mobilization are forbidden.                                  (b) Armament.    Definite tables are laid down limiting  the  numbers and  types  of  weapons, togetherwith their  stocks of reserves and ammunition ;  medium  and heavy  artillery,  with theexception of certain guns for coast defence and the fortress of Konigsberg, are forbidden,as also are tanks and  armoured cars.   The  manufacture or import of  materials forchemical warfare is forbidden and Germany&apos;s armed forces must  not include any military or naval air forces.                              (c)  Disarmament control.    To  enforce these restrictions  an  Inter-Allied  Military Commission  of  Controlremained in Berlin until 31st January, 1927, when military control  passed to the Leagueof Nations.  By this  date the numbers,  organization and  equipment  of the  german army had,  broadly  speaking, been brought into conformity with the  provisions of theTreaty of Versailles.   I  do not intend to imply by this statement that Germany hadplacidly accepted the military  restrictions  ; this was far from being the case. *  Therestrictions had  to  be forced  on Germany against  her  will and the  Commission  ofControl  had been faced continuously with every possible form of  obstruction and evasion.                                    2.  POLICY.    This obstruction of the work of the Commission of Control  was not confined  tominor officials acting under a sense of  patriotism, but was based  on  the considered polkyof Germany&apos;s leading statesmen and military chiefs.   There is ample evidence from  theirpublic speeches to show that all along they  have  regarded such restrictions as  being of a    (B2S/1S)  40 12/28  W.O.P.  4030
purely temporary nature and. that Germany&apos;s ambitionis again  to  take her place as -a first-class military power.  ;J(?or instance, General Groner, the Minister  of  Defence, in a speech delivered at the conclusion of the manoeuvres in Silesia, on 25th September, 1928,stated that it was  the  duty  of everybody  to fight obstinately  and  incessantly for germany&apos;s equal rights in !the  domain  of armaments, and it was their duty to study, atall events  theoretically^ technical  advances  and  innovations  in regard to  modernarmaments.  In  this connection it is  of interest to note the  following&quot; extract  fromthe Introduction to  the German Field Service Regulations which appeared  over the signature of General von Seeckt:  &quot; These regulations are based on the army of a moderngreat military power and not on the 100,000 army allowed us by the Treaty of Peace.&quot;The draft &quot; Infantry Training Manual &quot;  amplified  this  with the statement that &quot; thepresent army must in all, hcirpumstances consider  itself a,s an army of cadres  which iswaiting the moment when a(,new grouping of Powers will permit the people in arms, atpresent on leave, to return to the Colours.&quot;     A further insight into Geimmny&apos;s military intentions has  been given  by the lecturesdelivered this year by General von  Seeckr... A  lecture  delivered  by  him on 3rd  Aprilhas already been sent, to^he&apos; OLD. inV the. War, Office Blue Intelligence Summary forAugust,  1928.   This was amplified by  a second deeture delivered on 26th June, 1928, inwhich the following passage occurred :-          * *&quot;  ..         &quot; The day  of armed masses seems to.be,over.  The common  objective of  both    soldiers  and statesmen must  be to  bring a war to a successful end  as rapidly as    possible.   We must therefore replace the mass, by superior efficiency, and oppose    mind tp matter.  This high standard of efficiency can only be reached by professional    armies : at the same time the requirements., of national defence demand that  every    able-bodied  man must be trained to arms.  Therefore we must have a professional    army plus a national army.         The national defence must therefore comprise a small professional  army of long    service,  preferably  enlisted  on  a voluntary basis, with a very high standard&apos;of    training and armament.   Behind this must be a system of universal  servibe with  a    short period,of  training for every young man.  The national industries must at the    same time be organized so as to be capable of mass-production on the outbreak of    war.  The future of Germany depends on the solution of this problem.&quot;    General von Seeckt was the creator of the modern German Army, and though he nolonger holds an  official position, the military doctrine, as preached  by him now,&apos; can betaken as  that which he inculcated into the army between the years 1920 and 1926,  whenhe was &quot; Chef der Heeresleitung&quot;.   It  is obvious therefore, that the  military leaders ofrepublican Germany  are determined that their country shall have an army commensurate with her size and world position, and  that, as I will show in subsequent paragraphs, theyare deliberately organizing  in  such a way that, while observing  as  far as  necessary theletter  of  the  law, they will  be in a position to expand the  existing Reichsheer into a modern  first-class army, the moment Germany is liberated  from the restrictions of thePeace Treaty.                                  3.  EFFECTIVES.                              Estimates of Man-power.    The German Army is limited to the Treaty figure of  100,000 and reserve formationsare forbidden.   This number naturally does not represent the total trained or partiallytrained  man-power of Germany, and the military leaders can rely  on  the services ofcertain groups which are discussed in detail below.   They are faced, however, with thedifficulty of organizing them as reserves in secret :     (i)  Men with war service. -It is  calculated that  there are some 1,700,000 men, still under-the age  of 35, who served with  the German armies during the war.  After thisage they can no longer be considered  fit for active  service and accordingly will disappearat the rate of 300,000 a year.  By 1935  this reserve will have  disappeared entirely, and,in the meantime, their efficiency can not be considered as  being high since they havealready been 10 years away from the colours.   These men  all belong to the Old Comrades&apos;Associations, which are grouped  into an  organization known as  the  Kyffhauser Bund,and a proportion are also  members  or instructors  of one  or  other of  the &quot;patrioticassociations.&quot;    (ii)  &quot; Zeitfreiwillige&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; (temporary volunteers&apos;).-In the years  immediately succeedingthe war,  the German military authorities, in order to create a reserve, encouraged recruit?&apos;
33to enter the array secretly and to undergo training for periods varying from six weeks to six months.   These volunteers were mainly of the patriotic student type and the training&apos;given was mainly with the object  of  fitting them for the roles of technical specialists inthe event  of mobilization.   Definite  figures of the  numbers trained are naturally notavailable, but it is estimated  that  they had amounted to about 500,000 men by 1925,when the protests of the Allies put an end to these activities.     (hi) Patriotic Associations. Most German males of military age are members of oneor other  of the so-called patriotic associations, in which  they  are  taught the  elements of discipline,  marching, tactics, shooting and physical culture.  The first associations, suchas the Stahlhelm, Wehrwolf and  Jung Deutschen Orden, sprang up during the yearsfollowing the war with the  object  of  protecting Germany from  internal dangers and of safeguarding the eastern frontiers from Polish invasion.   As their politics tended towardsextreme  nationalism,  and their  membership ran into  millions,  the Republican  partiesbecame alarmed for the safety of  the Republic and started the association known as the&quot; Reichsbanner  Schwartz  Rot Gold,&quot;  which  soon  attained, a  membership  of  about three millions.     The standard of military training  attainable in these association^ is obviously nothigh, and a large proportion of the  members are physically unsuitable for incorporation inthe Army.   The important point, however, is that  the  organization of these associationsenables detailed nominal rolls,  to be maintained, which will  admit of individuals being called up as and when required,  and will obviate the  dislocation of national life whichwould otherwise be entailed by a system of indiscriminate recruiting, such as*we  had toadopt ourselves in 1914.    The &quot; Reichswehrministeriuni&quot; is known to be in touch with the more important ofthese  associations, whose members may,  at a conservative estimate, be taken as  2,000,000men who would be physically fit  for active service ;  these would  be additional  to the1,700,000 men previously referred  to as having had  war experience,  but wrould includethe 500,000 &quot; ZeitfreiwiHige.&quot;    There is also in existence  in Eastern  Germany an organization  known  as the&quot; Grenzschutz,&quot;  whose raison a&quot;8tre is to protect the frontiers of  East and West  Prussiaand Silesia against Polish invasion, until such time as the regular forces can mobilize and take the field.  This organization is not primarily a  political association and  comprisesmost of the able-bodied men in  the frontier districts irrespective of the associations towhich they may belong.   The  Commission of Control made  repeated efforts to secure itsdisbandment but without success.   The  estimated effective strength is about 115,000.    (iv)  Police. The &quot; Kyffhauser  Bund,&quot;  the  &quot;  Zeitfreiwillige &quot;  and the patrioticassociations can  provide  only partially-trained  men, but there is , one source from whichhighly-trained reserves are available, namely, the German Police.   The present strengthof,the German Police force  is  140,000, of which 105,000 are State, and the remainderCommunal, Police.   The State Police have 150 armoured cars, each armed  with two heavymachine guns, the men being armed with pistols, rifles (1 to every 3 men) and bayonets.Individual  training  is carried out on  military  lines  and   includes tactical schemes.35,000 are. located in barracks and organized into definite units.   Their potential military value is therefore high.    In 1914, only 80,000 police  were  required for the maintenance of internal order andit is  considered  that  at least  the  balance of  the  present total, i.e.,  60,000,  would beavailable  for military service.    The estimated  strength of trained or partially-trained  man  power  is therefore asfollows :     Fully  trained           The existing Regular Army      ...     ...     ...    ...     100,000         Men discharged normally from Regular Army   ...    ...      70,000         Polke     ...     .&quot;.................      60,000                                       Total      ......    230,000Partially,trained-     Zeitfreiwillige (temporary volunteers)  1                   2 ,000 ,000     Members of patriotic associations       j &quot;&apos;     &quot;&apos;     &quot;&apos;   5   &apos;     Men with combatant war service ...     ...     ...     ...  1,700,000Total      ......  3,700,000(4030)
J                                   4. ARMAMENTS.     It will be seen from  the foregoing that, as  regards  effectives, Germany&apos;s potential strength is great.   The real safeguard against the expansion of German military power is provided by the restrictions imposed  upon armaments by the Treaty; the most important being those forbidding the  use&apos;or possession of medium and heavy artillery and tanks.   It is possible that a few heavy and medium artillery units could  be formed  by stripping the coast defences and the Navy of a proportion of their weapons, but efficient tanks, let alone tank units, cannot be hurriedly created.     I  will  now consider the possibility of Germany having any considerable reserve stocks of war material.   The  work done  by the Commission  of Control  in  effecting  the destruction of large quantities of guns, machine guns, rifles and war stores of all kinds  is too well known to need repetition here,  and I do not consider that the Germans were successful in  concealing  any large  number of  guns, although it is certain that machine guns and rifles are to-day hidden in Germany or are in the hands of the Various associations.It is true that the German Government refused to produce the figures of their armamentproduction  for the  years 1914-1919, but it  has been estimated that in March, 1918,  the German gun strength of all-calibres, including those in the field, in reserve, undergoingrepair or under construction was about 38,000.   By November, 1918, this figure had, as aresult  of the  Allies&apos; victories,  been  reduced to  31,000.   The  total number  of guns,&apos;including those under construction,  destroyed by the Commission of Control was 39,597,a figure which included  two  or three thousand guns captured  from the Allies and anumber, of obsolete and damaged  guns.   It is  unlikely, therefore, that  the  Germans succeeded in  evading, to any&quot; large  extent, the  investigations  of the  Commission  ofControl.     The factor of  depreciation must  also  be taken into account, particularly as regardsammunition.   In European climates assembled small arms&quot; ammunition  can not be relied upon to last more than 12  to  14 years, although  if their  component  parts are storedindependently, their life is almost unlimited.   With artillery ammunition the position is slightly different.   Propellants carefully stored will last over 20 years, and high explosive shell and uncharged shrapnel  (i.e., without the  small  black: powder  filling)  will lastindefinitely.   This postulates, however, a high degree of  excellence in manufacture which would  not  have been  attainable in war manufacture and for these reasons I do notconsider that any appreciable reserve of artillery material which has been saved from war stocks  exists in Germany to-day.     I  will next  deal with Germany&apos;s  potentiality for manufacture since the war.  In 1919 she had  7,000 war  material factories.   By 1925 these had  been reduced to 33, the&apos; special machinery  of the remainder having been dispersed or destroyed.   I would like to emphasize here the importance of the German War Material Law, which was approved by  the Allies.  This  law  prohibits  the manufacture in German, and the import or&apos; export by  Germany, of war material of  all kinds.   The only exception is that the 33 factories mentioned above are allowed to manufacture the war material authorized by the Treaty  for the  requirements of the Army.  The possibility that this  law is not being strictly enforced necessitates the maintenance  of  a close watch  on its  operation, and- supposed infractions are occasionally  brought to notice.  That there  has been a  certain amount of  illegal  manufacture of war  material is evidenced by the German traffic in arms to Russia and China, but I do not consider that this has been on a scale sufficient to justify the belief that Germany  has been able  to build  up important reserve stocks. In this connection it is of  the highest importance that we should be kept adequately informed as to German  relations with  armament  firms in  foreign countries, particularly in Russia, as it is through this means that  Germany will be able to keep herself up to&quot; date at any rate in such matters as-experiment and design.-     It may be argued that, in the absence of precise information, the figure of 2,000,000partially-trained  men  from  the  patriotic  associations  is  so  high as to be improbable.During the war all  Germans  were called up for military service at the age of  18,  It willbe of interest, therefore, to consider  the number of men who have reached this age sincethe war.   The annual class  is over  500*000, but a conservative estimate of the total forthe 10 years can  be taken as 5,000,000.   My  figure of 2,000,000 accordingly representsonly 40 per cent,  of this total and is  not, therefore, in my opinion, an exaggeration.
   &quot;SR.                       5. THE  MILITARY  BUDGET.    The whole question of military organization  is  of course  dependent on the  amountof money available, and, in this connection  it is interesting to note the steady increase inthe German annual military budgets as shown by the following table                                                                 1924-25...1925-26...1926-27...1927-28...1928-29...18,900,00020,300,00023,400,00023,500,000-24,700,000::    I do not propose to discuss the 1928-29 Budget in detail, but a few comparisons with the  corresponding vote of the German 1913-14  Budget,  when the Army was&quot;800,000 strong, and with certain corresponding British figures may be of interest.    (a) Replacement  and  repair  of  small  arms  and  machine  guns  and  opticalinstruments :                                                                      ;                                                                 Millions of marks.         1913-14 (Army 800,000 strong)     .............    9*9         1928-29 (Army 100,000 strong).........     ...   14-7    Replacement and repair of  artillery material            1913-14 (including heavy artillery)   ...     ...     ...     ...    3&apos;1         1928-29 (heavy artillery not allowed)...&apos;-   ...&quot;    ...     ...    5&apos;7    (b) Under the Treaty, Germany is  allowed an annual expenditure of 25,000,000rounds of small arm ammunition, and the relevant  sum allotted in this year&apos;s Budget is 500,000.   According to British prices, the cost of this amount of ammunition wouldbe  150,000.  It is of interest to note that the difference between these figures,  350,000,is precisely the sum which would be required to establish the reserves of raw material for small arm ammunition considered desirable as a factory reserve for this country.    (c) The training grant for the British  Regular  Army for  1928-29 amounted to 138,000.   The  corresponding German vote was  380,000, but a further  460,000 wasallotted for field^firing and practice camps, exclusive of ammunition expended.    These items are selected at random, but  they are sufficient  to show that german military expenditure is on a distinctly lavish scale, even taking into account the increased cost of production.  It is noteworthy that  votes are reversible that is to say, that any sums not expended are credited to the Minister of Defence, who has  not to account forthem further.    I  am  of opinion that the German military authorities are endeavouring to obtainmoney by ajl means in their power, including overestimating for legitimate services, inorder to enable them to provide the necessary finance for certain activities not allowed bythe Treaty.  Such activities, which  are  naturally  kept  secret, might well include  thecollection of reserve stocks of material, the,cost of experiments in forbidden weapons, and subsidies to certain firms who are potential manufacturers  of war material.                            6. INDUSTRIAL MOBILIZATION.    It is unnecessary for me to expatiate on the importance of the mobilization of industry for war purposes, and this is a subject to  which Germany  has been paying particular.attention.   For instance, General Groner,  the Minister of Defence,  is himself an expert inthis subject, having been responsible, during the war, for.carrying  out  &quot;the Hindenburgprogramme&quot; for  the  supply of war  material.  Moreover, there exists  in  germany central organization, known as the &quot; Reichsverband der deutschen Industrie,&quot; which hasbeen created to control and  direct the peace-time  industry and commerce of Germany.Its value as a controlling authority, with full  powers and with a staff and technical dataavailable from the first moment that war is  even a possibility, would be  inestimable.   Itis known that the &quot; Reichswehrministerium  &quot; works in  direct touch  with this body, andthe existence of the Reichsverband, coupled  with the  peculiar centralised organization ofthe main German industries,  would automatically ensure a rapid turn-over from peace towar production.   The most striking example of centralization is provided by the chemical industry, which could  undoubtedly mobilize for war ,in a very short space of time.   It
r                                    7. AVIATION.     ...              .     I will not&apos;offer an opinion as to the military value of Germany&apos;s civil aviation, but itis obvious that any country with such  a highly centralised and well developed  civil airorganization,  backed by  a nourishing aircraft  industry,&apos; is well placed for the rapid development of a military air force, once the treaty restrictions in this respect are removedor modified.                                   8. CONCLUSION.     To  summarize what I have said, I  am of opinion that in existing circumstancesGermany is not.in  a position  to  wage an aggressive war, nor possibly, even to defendherself against the attack of a first class Power for a sufficient length of-time to mobilizethe nation for defence.   The deciding factor is the lack, of the necessary armaments andequipment, and not of man power.     The declared policy  of her  leaders,  both statesmen and soldiers, is, however, to procure a revision of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and  again to set upGermany as a  first  class  military  Power.   With&apos;this end in view, preparations for expansion are already being made  both financially and practically.  Touch is maintainedwdth the patriotic associations with a view  to providing reserves of partially trained man-pbwer.   Experiments are&apos;being carried out,&apos; not only  tactically but technically, withweapons now forbidden by the Peace Treaty.  Certain firms, whose factories are  capableof being converted  to  the manufacture of war material, are being subsidised,  and thenecessary plans for the industrial mobilization of the nation  in  the event of  war are atleast being considered, even if they are not already in hand.     The attitude of Germany  towards the  failure so far of the League of Nations  to achieve any measure of disarmament among the ex-allied nations is well known.   I cannothelp feeling that if the efforts of the  Preparatory  Commission on Disarmament to reach agreement  prove to  be unsuccessful,  Germany  will claim to  be absolved from thedisarmament clauses of the Treaty  of  Versailles.   I have  no doubt, therefore, that in such .circumstances little time would elapse  before Germany would again become a first classmilitary  Power.must be remembered, too, that the more completely general disarmament is carried out thegreater will be the-relative importance of chemical warfare.   It would, therefore, appearthat Germany has a distinct lead so far  as industrial mobilization for war  purposes isconcerned.                                 &apos; ,
