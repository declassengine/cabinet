Copy No,CP.  366 (28).                                 CABINET.28IRISH FREE  STATE.              CONTEMPLATED ISSUE OF  TRUSTEE STOCK IN LONDON.                    Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    I ASK for the decision of my colleagues on the subject dealt with in the appendedTreasury Memorandum.                                                                   w.  s. c.    Treasury Chambers,          November 26,  1928.     1.   THE Free  State Government desire before  Christmas a loan for a very substantial  amount, which  is understood to be about  8,000,000,  on the london market and mainly  from British rather than Irish subscribers.  The cost of suchan operation; and even its feasibility, depend on the Loan being declared a security in which British Trustees may invest.  To obtain Trustee status for their stock theFree State Government must arrange for a register in London and, in particular,they must comply with  the three  conditions laid down by the Treasury,  understatutory powers given by the Colonial Stock Acts in 1900, viz. :          &quot; (a.) The Colony shall provide by legislation for the  payment out of the    revenues of the Colony of any sum which may become payable to Stock holders    under any Judgment, Decree, Rule, or Order of a Court in the United Kingdom;         (b.) The Colony shall satisfy the Treasury  that adequate  funds (as and    when required) will be made available in the United Kingdom to meet any such    Judgment, Decree, Rule or Order;         (c.) The Colonial &quot;Government shall place on  record a formal expression of    their opinion that any  Colonial legislation which  appears to the  Imperial    Government  to  alter any of the provisions affecting the Stock to the injury of    the Stockholder, or to involve a departure from the original contract in regard    to the Stock, would properly be disallowed.&quot;    2.   Some difficult questions arose from the desire of the Free State to make a simultaneous issue of the loan in London and Dublin.  These matters were underthe consideration of the Treasury, when a far more  difficult question arose. A fewdays ago the Governor of the Bank of Ireland, who  is acting  for  the Free  StateGovernment in  this matter,  called and indicated that the Finance  Minister of theFree State could not see his  way to  subscribe in  any circumstances to condition  (c).    3.   This condition dates from  1900  when  the  power of disallowing  Coloniallegislation was  a matter  of  course.   The  importance attached to this safeguard is indicated therefore by the fact that it was thought necessary to set it out specificallyin the Treasury conditions.  It is indeed difficult to see how the British Governmentcould authorise British Trustees to invest funds in a security, if the British Govern-ment were powerless to intervene  to protect the interests of those Trustees.  It ison the faith of this condition that British Trust funds to an amount approaching 600 millions have been invested in Dominion and Colonial Securities.  The present       [18502]
is the first occasion on which the Free State have sought Trustee status for any stock,but clearly any concession to the Free State would  have to be extended to otherDominions.    4.  It is necessary to consider how the question is affected by the proceedings ofthe Imperial Conference of 1926.  The Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of that conference  recommended  that  steps should  be taken by  Great Britain and  theDominions to  set up  a Committee to examine the existing statutory  provisionsrequiring reservation  of Dominion legislation for  the  assent  of His Majesty orauthorising the disallowance of such legislation.  This Committee has not yet been set up, but the ground has been explored thoroughly by a (purely British) DominionsLegislation Committee.    5.  This latter Committee has not yet reported.  It is, however,  understood thatit will propose  that the power to disallow Dominion legislation should cease to existexcept that a saving will be needed to meet the case of Dominion  Loans which haveattained Trustee Status under the Colonial Stock Acts &quot; or may attain such  statusunder such arrangements as may  be made in future.&quot;  After pointing out that toremove the power of disallowance would be breach  of the  terms on which Britishcitizens invested their money, the Committee will, it is  understood, deal with  thequestion of future loans  on the following lines:   &quot; As regards the future,  theDominions will undoubtedly desire their Stocks to be Trustee Stocks  in this country,and it is for the British Treasury and the Lord Chancellor  to consider what control is necessary  in order  to safeguard the interests of  British Trustees.  The most satisfactory course would undoubtedly be to maintain the existing system for  future as well as for existing funds, and we have  no reason to suppose that in the specialcircumstances of this particular case this would be unacceptable to the Dominions.&quot;    6.  The issue seems to be more a practical than a constitutional one.  On  theone hand, a Dominion wishes to raise money in the London market  with the benefitof trustee status under  a  British Act of Parliament;, on  the other hand, Britishinvestors  are entitled  tq ,the safeguards  which Parliament and  Government haveframed and nothing short of them.   There is no obligation on a Dominion to cometo the London market, or, if it does so, to borrow  on  a trustee basis.   There is.equally no obligation on the British public to  subscribe, nor will it subscribe,  unlesssatisfied with the terms and conditions of a loan.  The existing  safeguards  are atleast  as valuable to the Dominions, as enabling them to tap British resources, as theyare to the public here,. and it is impossible  to see what effective safeguard could besubstituted for condition (c)  of the existing regulations.    7.  In all probability the Free State would find itself unable to launch  a loanin London successfully without trustee status, and it is no doubt  unfortunate  forthe Free State to be unable to borrow here, with the possible result that it may be forced back sooner or later  to America.   But the difficulty is not  of  our making.We cannot treat the Irish Free State differently from other Dominions.  And  thesafeguard which we are asked to  waive  is  pivotal and, so far  as  can be seen,irreplaceable.  In these circumstances,  it would appear that the  condition must bemaintained, although  this may involve the  Irish Free State going without its loan.The  condition  would only be modified,  if at  all, after the  whole question has beenfully explored  in conjunction  with the other analogous  issues  which  the  Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of  the Imperial Conference raised.
