Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy  No.   28CP.  377  (28).CABINET.CHINESE BOXER  INDEMNITY.            MEMORANDUM BY THE  CHANCELLOR OF  THE EXCHEQUER.    IN the spring of this year the  Foreign Office  offered strong opposition to theproposal that the balance then standing to the credit of the Chinese Indemnity fund of approximately  2 millions should be paid to the Exchequer as  a partial set-off to the additional  expenditure of  4 millions incurred upon  the Shanghai defence force.  The Foreign Office objected that we were pledged to use the Boxer Indemnityfor educational purposes and other  objects of mutual benefit to Great Britain and china, and,  in particular, emphasised the points that (1) the Advisory  committee under Lord Buxton would resign in protest if the fund were diverted; (2) we shouldalienate the sympathy of the intelligentsia in China if the idea of using the money for education were abandoned; and  (3) that we should be prejudiced if we retainedthe British portion of the Indemnity while our rivals for the affections of China (the americans and Japanese)  used their  portions of the indemnity  for educationalpurposes.  In view of these  arguments I  agreed  not to press the claims  of theExchequer at that time.    2.   But the Foreign Office now  admit  that it is not possible to  carry into effect the Act of  1925, and  they propose  to  pay  over  to   the Chinese  Governmentunconditionally the whole of the existing balance and all future instalments of theBoxer Indemnity.  It has, indeed, become apparent that  the China of to-day withits intensely Nationalist point of view would not tolerate any scheme for using themoney for educational and other purposes of &quot;mutual benefit to Great Britain and china,&quot; but would rather  regard  any such plan as  a  means of  inculcating Westernideas in Chinese minds, and therefore as an insidious form  of Imperialism.  this modification of view destroys at a stroke  the whole  case which the Foreign Officemade against the Treasury proposal in January  last.   There  is  no longer  anyquestion of using the money  for  educational purposes of mutual benefit to GreatBritain and China, and the sympathies of the Chinese intelligentsia, and the feelings of Lord Buxton&apos;s Committee could not longer be invoked as  turning the scale; thequestion is simply whether the Fund shall be utilised by the British or by the ChineseGovernment.    3.  Sir Miles Lampson said in January : &quot;It  is, on  the face of it, absurd andeven wrong voluntarily to return to the Chinese a huge sum, in itself a reimbursement of former actual British expenditure, more or less in the nature of a free gift to theChinese at the expense of the British taxpayer.&quot;  The words &quot; more or  less &quot; becomeno longer applicable, and  the  absurdity  and wrongness  of  the proposal  arecorrespondingly accentuated.  There  has  been  no improvement in our financialposition since the question was discussed in the spring;  and the surrender of ourrights to this Fund could only be justified if equivalent or  greater advantage for thiscountry could be  obtained by utilising it otherwise.  It  would be  wanton folly  to surrender the money unconditionally to the Chinese Government.  Such a decisions would clearly not be welcomed by the Chinese intelligentsia or their  sympathisershere, and  it would be deeply resented by the British commercial  community in Chinaso long as His Majesty&apos;s Government do not secure the satisfaction of their pecuniaryclaims.  To the Chinese Government such a decision would  inevitably be regarded       [18555]
as a sign of weakness rather than of generosity;  and  they are much more likelyto appreciate an arrangement by which we undertake to waive future instalmentsof the Boxer Indemnity on condition that the existing balance  (which now amountsto  2,604.781) is retained by the Exchequer.    4.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  are  being frequently attacked on the groundthat they are too readily disposed to abandon the claims of this country on foreign nations,  and I  must urge the Cabinet to reject  the proposal made by&apos;the&apos;ForeignOffice.  Instead, I suggest that Sir M. Lampson should be instructed to negotiate an agreement with the Chinese Government by which  His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould surrender all future instalments &quot;of the Indemnity on condition that,  firstly,the existing  Fund is paid to the  British Exchequer on  account of the expenditure incurred over Shanghai;  and secondly, satisfactory arrangements are reached aboutthe Commercial Treaty and the settlement of private British claims.  As regardsprocedure, the existing Fund could be taken into the  Exchequer by a single, clause in the next Finance Bill, and  future instalments could be renounced by executive action, a Treasury Minute being laid before Parliament at the time of,-or shortly after, the announcement of the decision.                                                                  w. s.  c.t   Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,\                .  December 3, 1928.    .
