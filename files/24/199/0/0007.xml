COMPENSATION 1*03 civil gBRYANTS UNDER ARTICLE X.             &quot;OF THE ARTICLES 0? AGREEMENT.&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State^for, Dominion Affairs.         My oolleagues will be aware that in their Report    delivered on November 13th (a copy of which is annexed as    Appendix I)  the judicial Committee of the Privy Council    upheld on every point,  although on different grounds, the    decision of the previous Board in Wigg and CochraneTs case.    The effeot of this Report,  and of the previous decision, is    that the civil servants concerned,  some 2,000 in number,    have been declared to be entitled to arrears of pension    and lump sum payments estimated by the Treasury to amount    to some  50,000 and to a future increase in pension estimated    to amount to some  3,000 to  4,000 per annum.         According to Press Reports, Mr. Blythe (the Froe State    Minister of Finance) has announced that the Free State    Government docline to pay these amounts.    I have asked the    Minister for External Affairs how soon we may expeot to    receive a communication as to the action contemplated in    the matter, but have not yet received a reply.   Meanwhile    it is neoessary to consider the position which has arisen.         For this purpose It is desirable to summarise very    briefly the previous history of this matter.         The Government of Ireland Act, 1920. contained certain    provisions as to the compensation of oivil servants    transferred from the service of the Government of theSB C R S TCP. 357 (28).CABINET
                                       ofUnited Kingdom to  that of the Government/Southern  Irelandor Northern  Ireland, as the case might he, who as  a resultof such transfer might lose their employment, either bydismissal or voluntary resignation.   Briefly stated thecompensation was to be calculated in the same manner as thepensions of British civil servants are calculated underthe Superannuation Acts, but for the purpose of calculatingtheir compensation, the oivil servants conoerned were tobe allowed to count more than their actual years ofservice,  and to include certain hypothetical incrementsof pay.   Apart from these additions, it was clearly the Intention of Parliament that transferred Irish oivilservants should bo placed in as favourable, but not in amore favourable position as regards pensions than british civil servants.     So far as the Irish Free State was concerned, theGovernment of Ireland Act never came into operation:but the provisions referred to above were imported intothe Articles of Agreement between Great Britain andIreland of 1921, Article X of which states that                   &quot;The Government of the Irish Free State               agreos to pay fair compensation on terms               not less favourable than those accorded               by the Act of 1920 (i.e. tho Government               of  Ireland Act, 1920, referred to above)               to........ public servants, who are               discharged by It or who retire in oonse-               quence of the change of.government effected               in pursuance hereof&quot;The Articles of Agreement were given the force of lawby the Irish Free  State&quot;(Agreement) Act 1922, and
Article X was subsequently imported into the IrishFree State Constitution, Article 78 of which providesthat -              &quot;Every suoh existing officer who was          transferred from the British Government........          shall bo entitled to the benefit of Article X          of the Scheduled Treaty&quot;.     The Constitution further includes a provision.fArticle 66) that -              &quot;Nothing in this Constitution shall          impair the right of any person to petition          His Majesty for special leave to appeal from          tho Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council          or the right of His Majesty to grant suoh          leave&quot;.     The Constitution we*s made statutorily binding upon the Free State by Act 1 of Dail Eireann and uponGreat Britain by tho Irish Free State ConstitutionAct, 1922 (Session 2).     In the course of the passage through Parliamenthere of the various Acts by which tho Irish Free state was constituted amendments were moved to insert clausesproviding for the payment to transferred civil servants,who might be dismissed or resign, of the compensationlaid down in Article X of the Articles of Agreement,These amendments were successfully resisted by theGovernment (although one of them was carried in theHouso of Lords) on the ground that tho provisions ofthat Article wero already mado statutory by their inclusionfirst in tho Irish Free State (Agreement) Act and then in the Constitution Act:  but at the same time theGovernment stated explicitly and on several occasionsthat, in the event of the Free State Government failing to pay the compensation provided for in Article X they
themselves and their Buooessors stood as guarantors for thepayment of suoh compensation to the persons entitled thereto.As the exact terms of these guarantees are of importance,it will be well to set them-out at length.     : On December 19th 1921,  Mr. (now Sir) Austen Chamberlainstated         &quot;The......offloials concerned are assured     of treatment not less favourable than that     provided in the Government of Ireland Act, and     His Majesty1s Government will be tho guarantor     of their pensions&quot;.  (Debates, December 19th 1921     Col. 413).     On Maroh Oth, 1922, the then Colonial Secretary(Mr. Churchill), in the course of the Debate on the Eeportstage of tho Irish Free State (Agreement) Bill, quoted theabove statement and added          &quot;In the ultimate issuo we are the guarantor     of their pensions&quot;.   (Debates, March 8th 1922,     Col. 1342-3).     On Maroh  22nd, 1922, Lord Peel stated In the Houseof Lords          &quot;The position is that, in the first place,      the obligation of paying theso pensions......     ,. falls on the Government of the Free State.......      Behind them, of course there stands the British      Government, who have given their guarantee that if      those men suffer the British taxpayer will come      to the rescue...........These men are perfectly      safe.   In the first instance they have to rely      upon the Government of the South of Ireland, and      if that Government fails the pledge has been most      distinctly given that behind them is the guarantee      of the British&apos;.Government&apos;&quot;&apos;   (Debates, March 22nd, 1922,      Cols. 780-781).     On March 31st, 1922, Mr.Churchill said          &quot;I take this opportunity of renewing what      we have repeatedly said on behalf of His Majesty1 s      Government, namely that in the event of default      on the part of the Irish Government, the British      Government accepts full responsibility for the      liability which is prescribed in the present
              legislation.  What is that liability?              It is the liability laid down in the Act of              1920&quot;.  (Debates, March 21st 1922, Col.1753),        On the same date,  the Chief Secretary?- for Ireland, Sir Hamar Greenwood,  said                   &quot;I come now to what Is, I think the              only outstanding, point, the question of              guarantee.   As has been said again and              again, the  pledge of Ministers is considered              &quot;by the Government to be sufficient guarantee              that the pensions and all payments to these              public servants in Ireland will be paid, if              not by the  Free State Government, then by the              Government  that sits upon this Treasury Bench.              Let me say  that I know of no question that has              been before  the House in the present              generation which has been suj)ported so              unanimously by the heads of all the parties in              the House and by the House generally.    The              suggestion  that the undertaking given today              would be cancelled by some succeeding              Government was unreasonable.&quot; (Debates, Mr,rch              21st 1922,  Col.1772).        On November 28th  1922, the Lord Chancellor(Lord Birkeiihead) said,                   &quot;I have not and never have had the              slightest doubt that the ultimate position              of this  country, by whatever quasi legal terms              you may attempt to describe it,  must be that              of a guarantor to a liability which was              incurred in  pursuance of Imperial interests&quot;              (Debates, november 28th 1922,  Col.66).        On December 1st, 1922,  the then Lord Chancellor(Lord Cave)  stated that          &quot;The Constitution provides that all     of theja (i.e, transferred civil servants!) shall     &quot;be entitled, in the event of their giving up     office, to the benefits of Article Z of the     Treaty - I.e. to be compensated by the^ree     State Government for loss of office.  Article  X     provides the form and the extent of the     compensation.  It is to be regulated by the     provisions of the Act of 1920 - provisions     which were fully considered at the time with     representatives of the Civil Service,  and     accepted by them as satisfactory&quot;.  (Debases,     December 1st, 1921 Col.195).It will be seen from the above quotations that theform of the guarantee varied somewhat.   Sometimes the
3.1Act- of 1920  is mentioned,  sometimes  the Articles  of Agreement.It can hardly he doubted,  hcwever, that the guarantee was understood at the time, and  Is  still understood,  to be  aguarantee of the Compensation payable under the Articles ofAgreement whatever that might be.   Until recently, iie.until judicial proceedings were  instituted, it was assumed that the compensation  payable under the Articles  of agreement would not differ from  that payable under the Act  of 1920.Indeed we have ourselves admitted to the Free State Government(see the despatch of 20th  January 1928 of which a. copy  is annexed as Appendix II) that we  agree that it would not beequitable that the transferred  civil servants should receive more favourable treatment  in the matters in question than ifthey had remained in the Civil  Service of this country.   -  The possible courses  of action open to us may besummarised as follows  :     (a)  We may attempt to  persuade the Free State Governmentto accept the decision of  the Judicial Committee  that is tosay themselves to pay  in full the amounts Involved In thatdecision.    It could be pointed out to them that  the rightto apply for leave to  appeal to the King In Council, and ofHis Majesty  to grant leave,  Is  clearly stated in  the Con-stitution, and&apos; equally clearly  implies that the decision onany such appeal will be regarded as binding on the Government.and Courts of the Free State;   and that the Constitution wasthe result of a  solemn bargain  entered Into as recently as1921.    I  feel certain that  anv such attempt  would beforedoomed to failure.  The Irish Free State Government is so  deeply  committed to a refusal to  find the  money that forthem  to yield now would  probably mean  their fall;  Indeed even  if they had not  committed themselves,  I  doubt  whether they could safely agree.    Their position  is  by no  means                           -6-
secure;  and it is certain that the only alternativeGovernment, namely a Government under Mr. De Valera, would.be even less likely to pay regard to the Judicial Committee1sdecision.     (b)  7.e can inform Messrs. Wigg and Cochrane,. and anyother of the persons concerned who apply to us for paymentof the sums withheld by the Free State Government, that weare not prepared to pay until they have taken such steps as are open to them to secure payment from the Free StateGovernment by an application to the Free State Courts.   Itseems to me to be likely that the Free State Courts would regard themselves as bound by the decision of the JudicialCommittee In Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case and would give  judgmentaccordingly.   But it seems to be equally likely that, in theevent of such an application being made to the Free StateCourts, the Free State Government would at once introduce and rapidly pass into la?; legislation to the effect that  Article Xof the Articles of Agreement was to be deemed to mean, and always to have meant, that the compensation therein providedfor was to be assessed In  the manner hitherto adopted by  theFree State Government.   It will be remembered that It was inthis manner that they evaded the effect of a previousadverse decision by the Judicial Committee, but on  that occasion  the  legislation so Introduced  only purported to interpret  one  of their own Acts and not  an Article  of theTreaty.    Unilateral  legislation purporting to interpret  oneof  the Articles  of  the Treaty  would be  an unquestionablebreach of the  Treaty;  and whether  or not the Free  StateCourts were  to regard such legislation  as valid  (in view  ofthe provision in the  Free  State Act  giving  the force  rf the law to the Constitution,  that  &quot;if  any  provision  ... of  any law ...  is in any respect repugnant  to any of  the  provisions of the Scheduled Treaty  it shall  ...  be absolutely  void  and
inoperative&quot;), it is clear that the passage of such, legislation would create a constitutional crisis far more serious than thatcreated by the refusal of the Irish Free State Government toaccept the decision of the Judicial Committee.     (c)  &quot;Je may say to the Free State, in effect, &quot;V7e agreethat it was not the intention of either party to the Treatythat the transferred civil servants should rerceive more favour-able treatment in the calculation of their pensions than ifthey had remained in the Civil Service of this country.   TheJudicial Committee has now decided that, if that is what theTreaty was intended to mean, it did not in fact carry out thatintention.   Both parties are equally responsible for the baddrafting of the Treaty and both parties should therefore share the extra cost involved.   If you will pay half, (or any otherproportion) we will pay the remainder&quot;.   To this the FreeState Government would probably reply &quot;This particular provisionof the Treaty was inserted at your request and in your interests.It was for you to see that it was properly drafted and we arenot prepared to accept any. responsibility for your mistake&quot;.It could hardly be denied that there would be considerableforce in this contention:  and in any case, for the reasongiven at  (a)  above, namely that they are too deeply committed,I  see no  likelihood that the Free State Government would agreeto pay  even half  of the extra sums now  payable.      (d)   In  agreement with  the Irish Free State, legislation might be  introduced both here and in the Irish Free Stateinterpreting  Article  X in accordance with what was undoubtedly the  intention of  both parties  to it.    There  Is of  course noquestion  that  the Articles  of Agreement can properly be amended by bilateral  legislation  of  this kind-indeed  two  such  amend-ments have already  been made  -  and  it  will be  remembered that it had  already been agreed  between  the  two Governments and
announced, in Parliament (both here and in the FreeState) that such legislation would be introduced,before, at the suggestion of Lord Reading in thecourse of the Debate in the House of Lords onApril 25th last, It was decided to refer the matterback to the Judicial Committee.   There seem to  meto be serious objections to this coursd.   In the firstplace the justification for the previous decisionto legislate was that the decision of the JudicialCommittee was vitiated or tainted by a mistake of fact.   No such justification can be now alleged;and It would in my opinion be a very dangerous precedent to acquiesce and co-operate in legislation to reverse a decision of the Judicial Committee Inthe circumstances now existing, whatever may be theabstract merits of the point at issue.   Secondly,it is to be observed that the recent Report of theJudicial Committee raises a point which has not hitherto been under consideration.   The terms ofArticle X of the Treaty are that the persons affectedthereby shall be entitled to &quot;fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by theAct of 1920&quot; ;  but the Report appears to be to theeffect, not that the compensation actually awardedwas less than that which would have been awarded  underthe Act of 1920, but that &quot;fair&quot; compensation mightand Indeed should be something more.   We may agree ordisagree with the view taken by the Judicial Committee(if that is in fact their view), but we should find it very difficult to justify to Parliament the introductionof legislation to enforce /
a level of compensation which the&apos; Judicial Committeehas pronounced, rightly or wrongly, to be less than fair,Finally, apart from either of the considerations mentionedabove,, it seems to me to be very unlikely that, even ifsuch legislation could be passed through the House ofCommons, it could be passed through the House of Lords.        (e) The last possible course is that we should decide, and announce forthwith to Parliament, that inpursuance of our predecessors1  guarantee, we will ourselvesput the Irish Free State Government, into a position to paythe extra sums involved in the Judicial Committee1s decision.That decision must presumably be held to be binding not onlyin the cases of Wigg and Cochrane, but; also in the case ofall those who have been or may in the future be dismissed4,and of all those who have retired or may retire before March31st next (that date being the end of the period within whichvoluntary retirement on the terms of Article 2 is allowed)in circumstances entitling them to compensation.   It is notpossible to estimate with very close accuracy the amount involved,  but as indicated above it may be assumed that sucha decision would necessitate an Immediate payment of some 50,000 and  an annual payment, diminishing until it disappearson the death of the last pensioner,  of some  3,000 to  4,000.        On the whole I feel that this course is open to less objection than any of the others.   It will no doubt be pointed out in Parliament that we are acquiescing In a deliberate flouting of -Qae authority of the Judicial Committee
by the director State Government, and we shallpx-obably be urged to take drastic action to compel thorn to recognise that authority.   Forthe reasons given at (a) above, I do not thinlcthat any useful purpose would be served byprotesting to the Free State Government.  Furthermore,while the form and tone of the recent statements made on behalf of the Free State Government isto be deplored, and while L would not suggestthat we should in any way appear to countenance adefiance of the Judicial Committee, I am bound to saythat on the strict merits of the case there seems tome to be ouch to be said for their point of view, as indeed we have ourselves admitted in the despatch ofEGth January inferred to above.  They acceptedArticle X of the Treaty and have,  until now, faithfullycarried it out, but they have always regarded theliability for the pensions of Judges, civil servants and police as an unduly heavy burden upon a small andimpoverished country.   Those pensions are based uponsalaries substantially in excess of what would normallyhave been paid, or are now being paid,  in &amp; country ofthe size of the Free State; and the number of public servants who have seized the opportunity to retire onsubstantial pensions and engage in other pursuits at a                                       salary in/
many oases in excess of their previous salary has beenvery considerable.   When on top of this a totallyunexpected decision calls upon them to increase thesepensions in a manner which was certainly not intendedby either party to the Treaty and so as to place, thepersons concerned in a position substantially morefavourable than their colleagues in this country, it isnot altogether to be wondered at that they protest, muchas we may regret the form of their protestation.     If course fe) is accepted by the Cabinet as themost probable ultimate solution, it is in my opinionof considerable importance that we should proceed insuch a way as to forestall as far as possible any opendefiance of the Articles of Agreement by the Irish FreeState Government.   From this point of view the most.affective procedure would appear to be that we shouldnot ourselves, either now or in future, make theadditional payments necessary to implement the judgment,but, as I have indicated above, that we should providethe Irish Free State Government with funds to enablethem to do so.   This procedure would not only be administratively more convenient, but would also create a situation in which the Free State Government wouldappear to be formally complying with the judgment.From the Parliamentary point of view we could defend theaction taken on the ground that, whilst the Report ofthe Judicial Committee has created a situation in whichwe no longer feel justified in following the procedure which had been previously agreed upon with the FreeState Government as equitable, we nevertheless have aspecial responsibility towards the civil servantsaffected, and have acted in accordance with that responsibility.
            The immediate action which I propose is that the       Chancellor of the Exchequer and I should initiate       discussion with Free State Ministers at the earliest       possible date, and that we should put to them proposal       fc) above, on the understanding that if as seems lihely,       that proves to be unacceptable, we have authority to       proceed as at fe).                                  flKTD).

Confidential.X4TH PROOFSpecial reference En the matter of certain questions relating to the payment of        compensation ^to Civil Servants  under Article X of the Articles of        Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland.REPORT  OE THE LORDS OF  THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OP the privy COUNCIL,  DELIVERED THE 13TH NOVEMBER, 1928. Present at the Hearing ;MARQUESS OF READING.LORD PHILLIMORE.LORD HANWORTH.LORD ALNESS.CHIEF JUSTICE ANGLIN.[Delivered by THE MARQUESS OF READING.]r(B 306-778)TA
    This matter was referred to  the Judicial Committee  by anorder of His Majesty in Council made under Section 4 of theJudicial Committee Act, 1833.    The questions in issue relate to the principles applicable tothe determination of the compensation payable to those CivilServants in the service of the Crown&apos; who were transferred to theIrish Free State after the 20th March, 1922, and were dischargedor have  retired in consequence of the change  of Government,effected by  the establishment  of the  Government of  the IrishFree State in pursuance of the Articles of Agreement for a Treatymade between  Great Britain and Ireland.  The amount  of thecompensation payable was determined by the Government of theIrish Free State in accordance with the principles laid down incertain  minutes of the British Treasury, and in particular the minute of the 20th March,  1922.   The question  referred to their lordships is whether the payment of compensation so determined in respect of Civil Servants or other officials or public servantstransferred to the service of the Provisional Government or ofthe Government of the Irish Free State after the 20th  March,1922 is a payment of compensation within the meaning and trueintent of Article X of the Articles of Agreement.    Article X is as follows :              &quot;  The Government  of the Irish  Free State  agrees         to pay fair compensation onJ terms not less favourable         than those accorded  by the Act of  1920 to Judges,         Officials, Members of the Police Forces and other Public         Servants who are discharged or who retire in consequence         of  the change  of Government effected in pursuance         hereof.&quot;    This Act of 1920 is the Government of  Ireland Act, 1920.    The arguments before their Lordships covered a wide range,and raised some problems  difficult of solution, which lay  on thefringe, of-the question referred but which fortunately it is not necessary for their Lordships to solve.     Before proceeding to deal with the arguments at the  hearingbefore the Board it is desirable to pass in.brief review the facts and circumstances which have led to the present dispute.     In the  year 1920 it was contemplated that changes  shouldbe made in the government  and administration of Ireland, and accordingly the Government of  Ireland Act,  1920,  was  passed.Power  was  given to establish  Parliaments in  Southern andNorthern Ireland  and executive  authority  within the limitsreserved by the Act.  It was further provided by Section 55 that existing Irish  officers in the service of the Crown should continueto serve in Ireland and in the new Governments to be formed, and should  hold their offices upon the same tenure and the same conditions as hitherto.  In order to protect  those  officers who might .be removed from office or might  wish to retire  in con- sequence of the  change  to  be  effected in the  government  of Ireland, provision was made for payment to them of compensation\
 to be calculated in like manner as the superannuation allowances or gratuities had been applicable to them, with certain additional concessions on the terms and conditions contained in the Eighth Schedule of the Act and the Rules thereunder.     Under these provisions an officer in  an established capacity in the service of  the  Crown who wished to retire under the statutory conditions would receive as  compensation under this Act an annual allowance or pension calculated in like manner as the superannuation allowance he would  be qualified to  receive under the Superannuation Acts, 1834  to 1914, if he retired on the ground of ill-health, supplemented for the purpose  of that calculation by certain additional  years  of service and  certain notional increments of salary.     The annual allowance or pension payable under the Super- annuation Acts, 1834-1914 to a Civil Servant who retires on the ground of ill-health after not less than ten  years&apos; service is one- sixtieth of the salary and emoluments of his office at the date of his retirement for each year of service.  A new system was introduced under the Superannuation Act of 1909 for the benefit of those officers who  elected to avail themselves of it.  They became entitled to an  annual  allowance calculated upon one- eightieth instead of one-sixtieth  per  year of  service,  and in addition to a lump sum payment  of one-thirtieth of the salary and emoluments for each year of service, such payment not to exceed one and a &apos;half times the amount of the salary and emolu- ments.  During the War  the remuneration  was increased by what was termed a bonus.  At first no part of  the bonus  was included for the purpose of the calculation of these  allowances, but gradually it was recognised by  the Treasury and particularly by the minute of 20th March, 1922, that the  bonus had become a regular part of  the  Civil Servants&apos; remuneration, and  that it should be taken into account in computing the retiring allowances. The bonus is not a fixed sum like the salary, but is variable and is calculated on a sliding scale by reference to the official index figure of the cost of living.     The  scheme of Government under  the  Act  of 1920  was superseded in December, 1921 by the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, which by Article 17 provided for a provisional arrangement  for.the administration of Southern Ireland  during  the transitional  period, pending  the constitution of a Government of the Irish Free State.   By Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922,  passed on  31st March, 1922, force of law was  given to these  Articles, and provisions were made for carrying the  Treaty into  effect.   In pursuance of this Act an order in Council of 1st April, 1922 was issued transferring the  functions  in  connection with the administration of  public services in Southern Ireland to the Provisional Government, and in December,  1922, the Irish Free State was established,  andthe Constitution was enacted by Act No.  1  of the Dail Eireann.Article 77 of the Constitution  (1st Schedule to the Act) provides    (B 306-778)T                                   A 2
that  every existing officer (subject  to the  exception  therein mentioned) of the Provisional  Government at the date of thecoming into operation of this Constitution &quot; shall on that datebe transferred to and become an officer of the Irish Free State .  .  .and shall hold office by a tenure corresponding to  his previoustenure.&quot;  By  Article 78  &quot; every  such existing officer  who was transferred from the British Government by virtue of any transferof services  to the Provisional  Government shall be entitled tothe benefit of  Article X of the Scheduled Treaty/&apos;   This  statutemade the Articles of the Treaty part of the municipal law of theIrish  Free State.  In consequence of  these enactments existingIrish officers transferred to the Provisional Government, and later to the Irish Free State, became entitled by Irish Free State law tothe benefit of  Article X of the Treaty.    The compensation payable  by the Irish Free State Govern-ment to those officers who  were discharged by the  government or who  retired because of  the change of Government effected inpursuance of the Articles for the Treaty,  and who  came withinthe provisions of  Article  X,  was  assessed by  the  Ministerof- Finance of the Irish  Free  State assisted by a  Committeecarefully selected  for this  purpose.   It is  not  disputed  thatthe Minister of Finance assessed the  compensation in accord-ance with the principles set forth in the minutes of the  british treasury, including the minute of 20th March, 1922, but the  CivilServants were dissatisfied with a part  of the award and claimed that the compensation so determined was not fair compensationwithin the meaning  of Article X.  They raised objections to theaward in respect of,  inter  alia, the following two matters :     (1)  In regard to the portion of the annual allowance whichis computed on the bonus as distinguished from the fixed salaryit was made a condition of the award that this portion should be adjusted quarterly hy reference to the official  figure of  cost ofliving, and should be reduced according to  the sliding scale whenthe cost of living figure fell, but that it should not be increasedbe)^ond the amount  ascertained at the date of retirement if thecost of  living  figure  rose.  This principle is known as the over-riding maximum.    (2)  In.  regard to that  portion  of  the lump  sum  payment which is computed on the bonus,  the award was based upon 75per cent., and not upon the whole of the bonus payable for the quarter preceding the date of retirement.    The  meaning and  intent of  Article X and  the principlesupon which the compensation payable under it should be assessed,including the  principles relating  to the over-riding maximumand the 75 per cent, above-mentioned,  were  considered by theJudicial Committee  on the hearing of  the Appeal in the case  ofWigg and Cochrane  v. The Attorney-General of the Irish  FreeState  [1927] A.C.,  p. 674.  The  plaintiffs in the  action were two  Civil Servants  who sought to  enforce their claims underArticle  X in the Courts of  the Irish Free  State.  In expressing
their  opinion allowing the appeal in favour of  the two CivilServants, the Board, when referring to the effect of  the minute of the 20th March, 1922, upon the claims, assumed that these officers  had at the date of the minute been  transferred to  the;Government  of the Free State, and held that the minute couldnot affect their rights. &apos; These officers were, in fact, not trans-ferred to the Government of the Irish Free State until after  thedate of this minute, and it was contended that the advice tendered to His Majesty was tainted, if not vitiated, by this error of fact.It is because of this misapprehension by the previous Board -(its effect upon the decision will be considered later) that  the presentreference was ordered.    At  the  outset of the hearing in this reference, Mr. Dickie,who attended their Lordships on behalf of the Council of  the transferred Officers&apos;  Protection Association, argued  that  theBoard is bound in law, and without examination, to follow  thedecision in  the appeal in  Wigg  and Gochrane&apos;s case, whetherthey  considered it to  be right or wrong.   He  maintained thatif it was wrong, nothing short of an Act of Parliament couldrectify it.  Their Lordships are unable to hold that this proposi-tion stated in such an  extreme form is established.  It may wellbe that  the Board would hesitate long before disturbing a solemndecision by  a previous Board,  which raised an identical or evena similar issue  for determination ; but for the  proposition thatthe Board  is, in all circumstances,  bound to follow a previous decision, as it were, blindfold, they are unable to discover  anyadequate authority.   In other words, no  inflexible rule, whichfalls in all circumstances to be  applied, has been laid  down.    Mr. Dickie based his argument mainly upon cases  in which one of the parties to a suit which  had been decided against him,or a  person who was not a  party to the suit,  applied for arehearing of it.  Their  Lordships must however point out, in considering  these cases, that they  have  no direct  applicationto the  matter  before  the  Board,  as this Reference  is not  arehearing of the claims in  Wigg and  Cochrane&apos;s case.  Nowthere can be no doubt that, in the early cases,  a rigid standardwas   applied to the  competency  of  a  rehearing.  Thus,  inRajundernarain  Rae   v.  Bijai Govind Sing,  1 Moore&apos;s P.C.Cases,  p.  117  (1836)  (also  reported  in 2  Moore&apos;s  IndianAppeals, p. 181) Lord Brougham, in delivering the opinion ofthe Board, permitted himself to make some general observations,which seem, at first  sight, to favour Mr. Dickie&apos;s  contention.In that case an application  was made for a  rehearing.  Thedecision in the earlier  case had been given ex parte,  and waspronounced by default.  The earlier  order was  in these circum-stances  rescinded, and a re-hearing was allowed.  Lord Brougham,in giving the opinion of the Board, however, said (p. 126) : &quot; Itis unquestionably the  strict  rule, and  ought to be distinctlyunderstood as such, that no cause in this Court can be reheard,and that, an order once made that is, a report submitted to    (B306-778)T                                    A3
 Her Majesty, and adopted, by being made an order in Council  is final, and cannot be altered.  The  same is the case of the judgments of  the  House  of  Lords.  .  .  .  Whatever therefore has  been really determined in  these Courts, must stand, there being  no power  of  rehearing for the purpose of  changing the judgment pronounced.&quot;  Lord Brougham then pointed out that trivial errors in drawing up the judgment of the  Board might competently be corrected.   He then proceeded to add :  &quot; With the  exception  of one case in  1669, of  doubtful authority here, and another in Parliament of still less weight in 1642  (which was an appeal from the Privy Council  to Parliament, and at a time when the Government was in an unsettled state), no instance, it is believed,  can  be  produced of a rehearing upon the whole cause,  and an entire alteration  of the judgment once pronounced.&quot;     The case referred  to by  Lord Brougham as &quot;of doubtful authority&quot; was  Dumaresq v. Le Hardy, 11th March, 1667-68, (p. 127 of the report supra).  There it was alleged that a matter of fact had been misrepresented to the earlier Court, that con- sequently the point in question was mistaken, and that the cause had been determined against the petitioner^ clear and undoubted right and contrary to law.  An order  for rehearing was there made and the case was reheard though, in the result, the Board adhered to the former  decision.     The case of Fenton v. Hampton (1858), 11  Moore&apos;s P.G. Cases,  p. 347, cited during  the argument,  related to another proposition which dealt with the binding character of an earlier decision upon the Board in a  later case.  The Board there said (page 396) :  &quot; We think that  we are bound by the decision inthe case of Kielley v. Carson (1841), 4 Moore&apos;s P.C. Cases, p. 63,the  greater authority  of which,  as compared with Beaumont v. Barrett (1836) 1 Moore&apos;s P.C. Cases, p. 59, it is quite unnecessary to enlarge upon.&quot;  In Kielley v.  Carson the Board had refused to follow  the earlier decision  of  Beaumont  v. Barrett for reasons which  do not touch the argument in the present  case.   these decisions do  not contribute to the solution  of  the problem in issue.     Reference  may  also be made to  the case of the Singapore (1866)  L.R. 1 P.C., p. 378, which again related to rehearing.  in refusing a petition for rehearing, the Board at p. 388 said :  &quot; We do not affirm that there is no  competency in this Court to grant a rehearing in any case.  . .  . Although it is within the com- petency of the Court  to  grant a  rehearing, according  to  the authorities cited above, still  it must  be a  very  strong  case indeed, and coming within the class of cases there collected, that would  induce this Court so to  interfere.&quot;     The case which in comparatively recent times comes nearest to. formulating a  general proposition with reference to the com- petency of a rehearing is Hebhert v. PurcJias L.R. 3 P.C., p. 664. The decision of the Board is  thus set.out at p. 671 :  &quot;Their Lordships are of opinion, m respect of the two petitions addressed
to the Crown, that no further proceedings should be taken therein.Having carefully  weighed the arguments,  and considering thegreat public mischief which would  arise on  any doubt beingthrown on the finality of the decisions of the Judicial Committee,.their Lordships are of opinion that expediency requires that theprayer of the petitions should not be acceded to, and that theyshould  be refused with costs.&quot;   It  Avill be observed that thedecision turned on expediency, not on competency, and that theBoard abstained from laying down  any general rule which  is applicable to all cases.     The case of Hebbert v. Purchas  was  considered in Ridsdalev. Clifton, L.R. 2 P.D.. p. 276. That was a case which raised theqxiestion of the finality of a previous decision, not inter partes butas against strangers.   Having regard to  the fact that the case was  not concerned with questions of  law  affecting civil rights ofproperty,  but related to the  public worship of the EstablishedChurch, and that in Hebbert v. Purchas the decision was pronouncedex parte, the Board  stated that &quot; these considerations have ledtheir Lordships to  the conclusion  that, although very great weight ought to he given to the  decision in Hebbert v. Purclias,.yet they ought in the present case to hold themselves at liberty to examine  the reasons upon which the decision was arrived at,and, if they should find themselves forced to dissent from these reasons, to  decide upon their own view  of  the law &quot; (p. 307).The  Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, in giving the decision of theBoard, added with reference to decisions  relating to civil rightsof property  : &quot; Even, as to such decisions it would perhaps bedifficult to  say that they were,  as to third parties,  under  all circumstances and in all cases, absolutely final, but they certainlyought not to be reopened without the very  greatest hesitation &quot;(p. 306).  The  door is  thus not  closed against a request for arehearing at the instance of a stranger to an earlier decision, evenin a case  concerned  with civil rights  of property, although it isplainly  indicated that the  Board would be slow to  accede tosuch a request.     The case of  Hebbart v.  Purchas was followed in  VenJmtaNarasimha Appa Roiv v. The Court of Wards  and Others, 11 A.C.,p. 660 (1886), in which again a petition for rehearing was refused.In delivering the judgment of the Board,  however, Lord Watsonsaid (p. 663) :  &quot; It is quite true  that there  may be exceptional circumstances which will warrant this Board,  even after their advice has been acted upon by Her Majesty in Council, in allowing a case to he reheard at the instance of one of the parties.&quot;  But,he added ...  &quot;  Even before report, whilst the decision of theBoard is not yet res judicata, great caution has been observed inthe rehearing of appeals &quot; (p. 663).     Again,  in the case of Tooth  v. Power [1891]  A.C. (p. 284),in which a previous decision was urged upon the Board as binding upon it, the Judicial Committee said :  &quot; Their Lordships thinkit right to add that, although, for obvious reasons, the  case of     (B  306-778)T                                    A 4&apos;
sBarton v. Muir was relied on as an authority absolutely binding upon them by both parties at the Bar, yet it would have beentheir duty, had. the necessity arisen, to consider for themselveswhether  the decision is one  which they ought to follow.  It wasgiven ex parte;  and, that being the case, although great weightis clue to the decision of this Board, their Lordships are  at liberty to examine the reasons upon which that decision was arrived at.,and  if they should find themselves forced to dissent from these reasons,  to decide upon their own view of the law.  These arethe words used by Lord Cairns when delivering the judgment ofthe Board in Ridsdale v. Clifton, which contains a full expositionof the law upon  this point &quot; (p. 292).     In Read v.  Bishop  of  Lincoln [1892],  A.C.,  p.  644,  their lordships referred to Hebbert v. Purchas and Ridsdale v.&apos;Clifton,and  quoted the  relevant passages from these decisions to  which reference has already been made.   The Board proceeded to say :&quot; In the  present case their Lordships cannot but adopt the view expressed in  Ridsdcde  v. Clifton as  to  the effect of previousdecisions.  Whilst fully sensible of the weight to be attached tosuch decisions, their Lordships are at the same time  bound toexamine the  reasons upon which the  decisions rest, and to  giveeffect to  their own view of the law &quot; (p. 655).     The result of these  decisions is (1) that there i. no inherentincompetency in ordering a rehearing of a case already decided by the Board,  even when  a question  of a  right of property is involved, but (2) that such an  indulgence will be granted in very exceptional circumstances only.   It is of the nature of anextraordinarium  remedium.     The matter  now before their Lordships, however, presentsfeatures  which are Avidely different from those presented in thecases cited.     In the first place, as has already been pointed out, this isnot  a petition for a rehearing.   It is a reference to the board under section 4  of  the Judicial  Committee Act  of 1833.   If,however, Mr. Dickie is right, the reference may be a  futile andsterile proceeding, for, on his argument, one of the parties to itis foredoomed from the  outset to failure because of the previous decision.  If by that decision the matter of the present reference is res judicata, then the Board has  been invited to take part ina solemn farce, involving the waste of judicial time.     In the second place, the reference was granted because of analleged mistake of fact into which the previous Board was alleged to have  fallen, and which is said to  have been material  to theissue determined by it.   To suggest that, if that proposition bemade out, this  Board is constrained, blindfold, to adhere  to  adecision based on a material error in fact, appears to be repugnantto good  sense, and to attribute to the Board, as a Court of finalresort, an impotence which would be deplorable.   None  of thecases cited, unless it be the case of Dumaresq which, quantumvaleat, is inimical to Mr. Dickie&apos;&amp; argument deals with such  a
 situation ;  and none of them appears to present an insuperable obstacle to  a  different decision being reached by the Board hi this case from that pronounced in the case of Wigg and Cochrane.     In  these  circumstances their  Lordships  considered, after careful  attention had been given to the argument on behalf of the Civil  Servants,  that  it  was ill-founded  in  law,  and they accordingly informed the learned Attorney-General that they did not think it  necessary to require him to reply on this topic.     The Transferred Officers Protection Association only challenge in this reference the award, of the Government of the Irish Free State  upon the two matters above  mentioned, the one relating to the over-riding maximum, and the  other to the calculation of 75 per cent, in assessing the lump, sum payment.     Mr. Dickie, on  behalf of the Transferred Officers,  argued1 that the claim to fair compensation under  the Article was not limited or restricted  by limitations  or restrictions in the Act ofi 1920,  or in any British Treasury Minute, and that the  award in respect of these  two matters was not fair compensation within1 the meaning of Article X.     The Attorney-General,  who attended  their Lordships on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and Mr. Overend, on behalf of the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State, contended that the compensation awarded was fair compensation not less favour- able than  that accorded by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, that it had been calculated on the principles laid down in the Treasury Minutes, including the Minute of the  20th March, 1.922, and that the compensation so assessed was fair compensation within the meaning of the Article.     The solution of  the problem depends in the first instance upon the meaning to be attributed to the language of the Article. The Articles  are part of the statute law of the Irish Free State, and must be construed according to the principles of interpretation-applicable to the language of a statute.  Under the Article the Transferred Officers who come  within the statutory conditions are entitled to  compensation which is  fair and on terms not less favourable than  those accorded by the Act of 1920.   In their Lordships&apos; opinion, the language  of the Article imports that the terms  of the Act of 1920 are  the  minimum  which should be receivable by the officers,  but these terms  are clearly not the maximum  that may be awarded.   The words are not on the terms  accorded by the Act of 1920 but are  &quot; on terms not less favourable than those accorded,&quot; and imply by &quot; not less than &quot; that more may be awarded.  The words &quot; not less than &quot; cannot be construed as if they were synonymous with &quot; equivalent to &quot; or &quot; the same as.&quot;  Their Lordships therefore cannot doubt that the compensation to be awarded is not limited by the terms under the  Act of 1920,  although these should be considered for the purpose  of arriving at the proper award under the Article.  It is indeed essential  that regard should be had to them, for the
 compensation would not in any  event be fair which was less favourable than would be awarded under these terms.      Their  Lordships have next to . consider whether  an award which imposes two conditions : (1)  the over-riding maximum, and (2) the limitation of 75 per cent,  of the bonus in regard to the lump sum, is fair compensation under the Article  as interpreted by the Board.  It  follows from the observations&quot; already made by their Lordships that  the  mere fact  that the assessment was calculated  in  accordance with the  principles contained in the Treasury minute of the 20th March,  1922, does not establish that the compensation awarded is the true measure of the compensa- tion to which the transferred officers  have a legal right under the Article and the constitution of the Free State.  Theirs is a legal right, as was decided by the previous Board in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case, and the right is not questioned in this reference.  The position of the transferred servants under the Article thus differs materially from that of servants of the Crown who have no such legal right.  Section 30 of the Superannuation Act, 1834, expressly negatives it :  &quot; Nothing in this Act contained shall extend or be construed to  extend to give any  person an  absolute right to compensation  for past services, or  to  any  superannuation  or retiring allowance under  this Act.&quot;  Further, it is provided by Section 2 of the Superannuation Act,  1859, that &quot; if any question should arise in any department  of the  public service as to the claim of any person or class of persons for superannuation under this  clause, it shall be referred/ to  the Commissioners  of  the Treasury, whose decision shall be final.&quot;     Their Lordships are not unmindful of Mr. Dickie&apos;s argument that the Treasury minute could be challenged in the Courts by a servant of the Crown, but their Lordships find no justification for this contention.  Section  30  of the Superannuation  Act of 1834 is unrepealed,  and is still the enactment that governs the position.  The law  was clearly stated in  Cooper  v. The Queen (1880) (L.R., 14 CD. 311) and Yorke v. The King  (L.R.  [1915], &apos; 1 K.B. 852), and was recognised by the  House of Lords in Considine v. Mclnerney (L.R. [1916], 2 A.C. 162).  In Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case the previous Board approved these decisions, and affirmed the proposition that no  action could be brought to set aside or vary a decision of the Commissioners of the  Treasury.  At the hearing in this reference  their Lordships  were in complete accord with this opinion of the previous Board, and intimated to  the Attorney General that they would not require argument from  him in reply. Although their  Lordships hold that the  Treasury  minute of 20th March, 1922, is not binding upon  the  transferred officers who come within the statutory conditions, the minute  requires most careful consideration in arriving  at the amount that should be  awarded under Article X.  The minute was issued by the Commissioners  of the  Treasury in  pursuance of the discretionentrusted to them.   It was  submitted to Parliament and is binding upon  the servants of the Crown.  It announces  the
decisions of the Treasury on certain disputed matters regardingthe calculation of the bonus for the purpose of computing theretiring allowances.  After stating that  the  bonus  had now become a regular part of the Civil Servant&apos;s remuneration, itrecites that hitherto  75 per cent, of the bonus  payable  at thetime of retirement had been included in the emoluments uponwhich, together with the salary, the retiring allowances had beencomputed.  It directs that henceforward all awards of pension should be  calculated on the salary and emoluments, togetherwith an addition of the bonus calculated on a sliding scale, by reference to the average cost  of living for the three  precedingmonths, and subject to reassessment quarterly.  It further  directsthat, as under the Superannuation Acts the retiring allowancescould not exceed a prescribed proportion, appropriate  to theretiring Civil Servants length of service, of his salary and  emolu-ments on the  date of his retirement, the additional allowance or pension payable at any time will be subject to  the over-ridingmaximum.  This condition is imposed in relation to those CivilServants whose rights are limited by the Superannuation Acts,but their Lordships cannot think that it should be applied to theannual allowance or pension payable to transferred Civil Servants,whose rights are governed by Article X and are not limited bythe Superannuation Acts.   It is difficult  to understand why insuch circumstances the annual allowance, which will be reducedaccording to the sliding scale when the cost of living figure falls,should not be increased if the cost of living figure rises.  Theamount of the bonus ascertained at the date of retirement is notconclusive, it  may be made to vary and the annual  allowance will vary accordingly, but, if it be capable  of reduction, it  shouldequally be capable of increase.  If, notwithstanding the  rise inthe cost  of  living, the  annual allowance was not  increased,  itwould obviously be to the disadvantage of the officer  who mustsubmit to reduction should the cost of living fall,  and there  isno sufficient reason why such a condition should be imposed inregard, to  officers who are entitled to the compensation granted by the Article. Their  Lordships  are therefore  of  opinion thatthe condition  known as the over-riding maximum attached tothe award cannot be maintained.    In regard  to the lump sum payment the Lords of the Treasurycame to the conclusion, having regard to all the circumstances,that it was not possible to devise a more satisfactory  plan than to base the award as  hitherto upon 75 per cent, of the  bonus,to be calculated by reference to the cost of living figure as in thecase of annual allowances or pensions.  It is to be noted thatthe proportion of 75 per cent, is retained in regard to the lump sum payment, although it is abandoned for the  purpose  of the calculation of  the  annual allowance.  It does not purport to bebased upon exact calculation ; it is retained at 75 per cent, as apractical method  of  allowing  for the  variability  factor. the lump sum is calculated  (as provided in the Superannuation Act,
1909, Section I, Subsection 2) at a sum equal to one-thirtiethof the annual salary and emoluments multiplied by the numberof completed years of service.   It is stated in the minute that the adjustment of the  lump sum  according  to  this formula coiddonly be based upon broad  assumptions and could not be exact.Their Lordships find themselves in agreement with the reasoningin this respect of Meredith, J., who  tried the case in the  firstinstance.   The calculation  on 75 per cent, is an arbitrary rule,it is a rough and ready way of dealing with the  difficulty.  Itwas adopted by the Treasury  in their  discretion  as a way outof a perplexing situation.  It seems difficult to justify its applica-tion under Article X.   The lump sum is  intended to  provide asum for  capital expenditure, it may be  for the purchase of a house, or to make provision for dependants, or otherwise.  It isa  commutation, payable immediately,  of part of  the pension,which under the Act of 1909  is  reduced from the one-sixtiethproportion to one-eightieth.   In  assessing compensation underthe Article their Lordships think  it fair and reasonable to arriveat the sum by calculating it on the pension payable at the  first year  of retirement.  Their Lordships therefore agree with theopinion of the previous Board and of Meredith, J., in this respect,and hold that the calculation should  be made upon the full amount of the bonus, and that  the  limitation to 75 per cent.cannot be sustained.    After careful consideration their Lordships have thus arrivedat the same conclusions as  the  previous Board.  In view of this result it becomes unnecessary to deal with the ingenious argumentof Mr. Dickie, whereby he sought to establish that, although thetwo officers in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case had not at the  date ofthe minute of 20th March, 1922, been transferred to the IrishFree  State, they had on the 2nd  March, 1922, that is before thedate  of  the  minute,  been  transferred from  the service, of theBritish Government and, according to his contention,  to that ofthe Government of Southern Ireland, and consequently the minutecould not be held to  apply to  them.  No order in Council hadbeen  issued which effected this transfer,  but Mr. Dickie argued that it must be taken as matter of law that the officers had beentransferred on the 2nd March, 1922, because by virtue of section73 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, this was  the latestdate  at  which an &quot;appointed day&quot; under the  Act could.hefixed. Further, he  sought to prove by reference to variousorders in Council that  a Government of  Southern Ireland hadbeen set up before 2nd March, 1922, and that existing Irish officers had been transferred  to it.  He contended also that  the  board in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s  case would have  been fully justified in assuming that the officers  had at the date  of the  minute beentransferred to  the Government of Southern Ireland  instead of&quot;to the Government of the Irish Free  State,&quot; and  the same-decision  would have been reached.  The  arguments were com-plicated  and  raised difficult  questions.  At  the  hearing  their
f Lordships were not convinced of the soundness  of the proposi- tions advanced, but, in view of the conclusions of the Board, it has become unnecessary to examine them more closely  or  to pronounce a final opinion upon them.     Their Lordships  have given  careful consideration to the decision of the previous Board in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case, and they are satisfied that the statement regarding the date of transfer of  the two officers had  no effect upon the advice tendered by that Board to His Majesty.  The Lord Chancellor, when expressing the opinion of  the Board upon the appeal said :  &quot; The question to  be determined is  whether and to what extent the  disputed conditions are in accordance with the statutes,&quot; and his Lordship then proceeded to give the reasons of the Board for arriving  at their conclusions.   These are independent of the particular date&quot;&apos; of transfer, for they are based upon the view that when an existing Irish officer had been transferred to the Provisional Government or the Government of the Irish Free State he became entitled to the benefit of Article X.    Their Lordships are  of opinion that the claims made in this reference on behalf of the Transferred Officers in relation to the award have  been  established and their  Lordships will humblyadvise His Majesty accordingly.

(No.24)Sir,          I have the honour to state that yourdespatches No.291 of the 9th November and No.339  of the23rd December on the subject of the payment of compensa-tion to Civil Servants under Article 10 of the Articlesof Agreement of the 6th December, 1921, have been underthe consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in GreatBritain.    2.    The questions involved have required careful examination but I am now able to state  that HisMajestyTs Government in Great Britain accept the viewthat it would not be equitable that the transferred CivilServants should reoeive more favourable treatment in thematters in question thai), if they had remained in  theCivil Service of this country, and aft&apos;er fully reviewingall the circumstances they will accordingly be prepared,subject to information in greater detail as to thelines of the legislation which His MajestyTs Governmentin the Irish Free StaDe have in contemplation, to give their concurrence and co-operation in the general policy outlined in your despatch of 9th November.    3.    One important point which will need decisionrelates to the question of the reimbursement of theexpenditure incurred by or on behalf of the persons concerned as Plaintiffs in the case of Wigg and Cochraneversus the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State.
His Majesty1s Government in Great Britain would wishto commend this Question to the sympathetic consideration of His Majesty fs Government in the IrishFree State.    4.    A further point which requires consideration is that of the most appropriate time for a public announcement.
