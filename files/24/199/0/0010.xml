November 1928.                                                                           secret.                                                    Copy No.     fCP. 360 (28).                                CABINET.PROPOSED EXPERT - COMMITTEE  ON THE  OPERATIONOP   DOMINION  LEGISLATION  AND   SUB-CONFERENCE        ON  MERCHANT  SHIPPING  LEGISLATION.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    MY colleagues may be interested in  reading the enclosed despatch  fromSir William Clark reporting  a conversation with Mr. R. B. Bennett,  K.C., the leader of  the Opposition in  Canada.  Paragraphs  2 and  3 of this  despatchhave a bearing on the  suggestion made in the memorandum which I recentlycirculated (OP. 329 (28)  ) that it might be worth while ascertaining whether theCanadian Government would  be  willing to  propose  that the meetings of theproposed Expert Committee on the  Operation of Dominion Legislation and theSub-Conference on Merchant Shipping should be held at Ottawa.                                                                  L. S. A.    Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,              November 20, 1928.(No. 7.)                        Office of the High Co mmissioner for Great Britain,Sir,                                 &apos;      Ottawa, October 31, 1928.    I HAVE the  honour to report that I met Mr. Bennett, the Leader of theOpposition,  for the  first time  on  Saturday,  the 27th  October.  He has  beenabsent from Ottawa most of the time since my arrival on a series of campaigningtours.  I had been playing  golf with His Excellency and Mr. Bennett joined usafterwards at tea at the Golf Club.  The talk  turned on industrial progress andhe  delivered eloquent discourses  on  hydro-electric  development  and  modernmanufacturing plants, discourses so eloquent, indeed, that they sounded to mypractised ear suspiciously   like extracts  from  speeches theme number  one,&quot; Power&quot;;  theme  number  two,  &quot; Industry.&quot;  In  the  intervals between  theorations he was very  genial  and amusing.    2.   Subsequently he drove me home and, as we went round by  the  newbridge and drove slowly, we had about twenty minutes of very  friendly, but  as it seemed to me, on his side, rather purposive talk.   He began by saying that he feltthat he  ought to  be entirely frank and make  it clear  to me  that he  heartilydisliked &quot; the whole business.&quot; His volubility, as you are aware, makes him a littledifficult to follow, but his  main theme  was clear enough, viz., that equality ofstatus as defined in  1926 was a sham in  view  of the limitations on Canada&apos;s.powers and jurisdiction imposed by the British North America Act.  He admitted that he looked at the question from  the lawyer&apos;s standpoint, but professed alarmat the reaction which would take place as and when the sham had been more  fullydetected.  The process of detection seemed to him to be  growing in volume, andthe inevitable reaction, he  feared, might seriously affect loyalty to  the Britishconnexion.   I said that I was rather surprised  to hear  the matter so stronglystated, since I should have thought it was abundantly evident that there  was no      [18484]
pretence or arriere-pensee about Great Britain&apos;s action in joining in the declarationof 1926.  It was surely clear that  the  existence of over-riding powers, which wasfreely admitted and discussed in the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee&apos;s report,did not mean their exercise ; and if Canada wished for modification of  the british north America  Act  it  seemed very unlikely,  as things are,  that- the british parliament would refuse.    3.  Mr. Bennett agreed to this, but said that that raised a still graver issue,since Canada, if  she set  about devising a new constitution for herself, would  berent with internal dissensions which no doubt is all. too true.  The talk rangedrather confusedly round these two headings.  I ventured to  suggest  that, whileit might well have been easier in many respects if these issues had never come up,it seemed, on  looking  back over the history  of the  last  few  years, as if canada would have had a good deal to say about it if her national status  had not  beenfully recognised.  Mr.  Bennett did not specify in any clear terms what  alternative policy he would have preferred to have seen followed.    4.  He threw out  some sinister hints as to the ultimate aims of the  present prime Minister which  I, of course, ignored.    5.  I have had too little experience to form an opinion as to  how much  ofMr. Bennetts  talk represented his genuine convictions and how much is  anattempt to construct  an opposition platform out of what would  appear to  be rather unpromising material.  In  his  speeches he appears to  concentrate on acautious protectionism,  and,  on the political  side,  mainly on criticisms of theTokio Legation as unnecessary and as indicating an  impulse towards  disruption.(He puts the Canadian Missions to Washington and Paris in a different category.)Alike in his economic and constitutional themes he seems to be in the difficulty of having  no positive proposals to put forward or none, at any rate, which  can  beclothed in specific language.    6.  Mr. Bennett  was entertained last week  at a  big political banquet  at montreal.  He told us in  the course of  the  earlier talk at tea that over fifteenhundred people had been present; that he had had to deliver two speeches insteadof one; and that over  sixty per cent, of his audience were French.                                                    I have,. &amp;c.                                               (Signed)       W. H. CLARK.The Right Hon.  L. S. Amery, M.P.,      His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary             of State  for Dominion Affairs.
