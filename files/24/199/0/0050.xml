December 1928.SECRET,COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Draft Minutes of the 2&apos;.l$th Meeting, held on December 13, 1928.          ******   (10.)-SINGAPORE  BASE.   THE DEFENCES AND  DEVELOPMENT                         OF  THE  NAVAL  BASE.                          (C.I.D. Paper No. 329-C-.)            (Previous Reference :  C.I.D. 238th Meeting, Minute (4).)     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by  the Secretary (C.I.D.Paper No. 329-C), covering a revised estimate of the cost of the Singapore naval base.     SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS said that he had  asked that thepaper should be included in the Agenda as a subject for discussion rather than onemerely to be taken note of, as there had recently been important gunnery trials at portsmouth and Malta which had provided further experience with regard to thecapabilities of 9-2-inch guns in coast defence.   The trials had not been conclusive,but a certain amount of reasonable doubt had been aroused  as to the capabilitiesof these guns, and it seemed to him that before any large expenditure was undertaken at Singapore in connection with the installation of guns, whether 9-2-inch or 15-inch,further trials should take place.   If  the expenditure on these guns was deferred for one year to allow time for the results of the  trials to be carefully considered, a saving of  139,000 would be effected during the next financial year, and he thoughtthat this would meet with the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     SIR CHARLES MADDEN said that, so far as the Navy were concerned, theresult of the gunnery trials appeared to show that single guns or guns controlledsingly were not as efficient as guns in pairs or groups, and that, in effect, the problemof shooting with shore guns against ships was  the  same as that for ships againstshore targets.   It seemed to the Admiralty that efficient control of the coast defenceguns must be arranged, but this did not mean that the Admiralty had accepted theview that the trials had  shown gun defences to  be  less efficient to-day than in thepast.  On the other hand, they thought that coast defences could be rendered evenmore efficient.     SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS  said that his  heart was rejoiced bythe remarks just made by the First Sea Lord regarding the potential capabilities ofcoast defence guns, as the hits made by the shore guns in the trials were few and farbetween. He certainly thought, however, that a good deal more study was required before further expenditure Wa,s  incurred on coast defences.     SIR HUGH  THEN-CHARD  warmly  welcomed the  views expressed by theSecretary of State for War, and said he had been waiting five years for the present-situation to arise.  He asked if  it would not be possible for the Air Ministry to beprovided with the report  on the recent trials.     SIR GEORGE MILNE said that the report was not yet fit for circulation. TheWar Office did not yet know  what was wrong  with the  coast defences, whether itwas a question of  men, of the guns, of the  observation, or what.   A Committee,presided over by the Master-General of the Ordnance, had just been appointed to      [18606-1]                               &apos;           .Copy No.
investigate the whole question, and he suggested it would be hardly fair to circulate the report until proper deductions could be drawn from the results of the trials.     SIT? SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the Chief of the Air Staff should&apos;&apos;surel&apos;yisee the results of the trials, especially as aeroplanes had taken part in them.&quot;  ---------     SIR GEORGE MILNE, in reply to the  Eirst Sea Lord,  said that  it wouldprobably take a year to complete the. investigations now in, hand.  Referring to theFirst Sea Lord&apos;s suggestion that guns might have to be employed in pairs, he saidthat probably it would be necessary to reconsider the whole question of the Singaporedefences. .;.  MR. CHURCHILL observed that he did not agree that the three Chiefs of Staff,who were  jointly  responsible for offering  military advice to the&quot; Committee&apos;&apos;&apos;6rImperial Defence, should have technical secrets from one another.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he did not  want to  press for circulation of thereport on the gunnery trials to the whole Committee at the present stage, but, in  viewof the fact that aeroplanes  took part  in the experiments, and that air armament wasa possible alternative to gun defences, ,he was strongly of opinion,that the Chief ofthe Air Staff should be  allowed to see the report.     SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS remarked that the  War  Office didnot see all Air reports.       &apos;                   !&apos;,     SIR HUGH TRENCHARD replied that the only Air reports, made during thetrials in question were those by the Air observers, and these reports had, of course,gone to the authorities conducting the trials.   &apos;                   &apos;   -&apos;    &quot;   r     THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that  the question was,  at the present stage, one for the Chiefs of Staff themselves, and for no one else.     SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS said that, as he understood, it, theChiefs of Staff would first consider the report on the recent trials, and that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff would inform them  of the action- now being taken,namely, the setting-up of a Committee  under the Master-General of the  Ordnanceto study closely the results  of the trials.  The Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee wouldthen presumably wait for the Master-General of the Ordnance&apos;s report.  meanwhile the Cabinet had laid down  that the defences of  Singapore should be installed in two stages.  The  first, of these  stages included the  installation of certain 9-2-inch and15-inch guns, and was to  be completed by 1932.  What he  wished to propose  wasthat the Committee of Imperial  Defence should recommend to the. Cabinet that theexpenditure next year on the 9-2-inch and 15-inch armament at Singapore shouldbe postponed.  This would not necessarily mean  that all the guns at present includedin the first stage of the programme would not be  installed by 1932.:&apos; I - (,      .&apos;     THE PRIME  MINISTER concurred in this suggestion, and observed that itwould be foolish: to proceed with heavy expenditure on coast  defences before  theresults.of the recent bombardment trials had been carefully considered.          :.  ,V ,        :   &apos;^&apos;&apos;,0,                CONCLUSIONS.                     - .   - .i   - t  .

December 1928.SECEET.Copy No.   98329-C.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.SINGAPORE  BASE.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 322-0.)The Defences and the  Development of the Naval Base.NOTE BY  THE  SECBETABY.    IN 1927 two  important  papers  (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 304-C and  306-0) dealingwith the Singapore Naval Base were circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence.In the former the Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested that the scale of defences  should  he reconsidered,  and in the latter the Admiralty stated they had decided that the year 1937 should be accepted as  the date of  completion of the naval base, on the understanding that the floating dock would be ready for use in 1929, as previously arranged, and that no  change would be made in the programme  for theprovision of defences.    2.   In consequence, the Prime Minister directed that the three Fighting Depart-ments  should at once  consult  together  and  produce revised plans on the most economical scale  compatible  with the objects  to be  attained,  and  that with their proposals they should present an estimate  of the expenditure in each year up to 1937on the same basis as the  estimate presented in 1926 in C.I.D. Paper  No.  281-C(see Appendix to C.I.D. Paper No. 312-C).    3.   The  Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee considered this reference  in the firstinstance and submitted two reports (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 312-0  and 315-C), in whichthey recommended a revision  of the first stage  of the programme for the installation of the defences at Singapore and that the time (three years) originally allowed  for thecompletion of this stage should be prolonged by two  years,  i.e., to the  end  of  thefinancial year 1932-33.    These recommendations were subsequently approved by the Committee of ImperialDefence and the Cabinet (C.I.D. 234th Meeting and Cabinet 20 (28), Conclusion  12).    4.   The  attached revised estimate of expenditure  in each  year up to 1937* has there fore been prepared by the three Service Departments  on the same  basis  as  theestimate presented in C.I.D.  Paper No. 28L-C, and is circulated, by direction of  thePrime Minister, for the information of  the Committee.    * War Office expenditure after 1932 is not included, as the later stages of the scheme of defence havenot yet been settled.M. f.

This statement revises  and brings up  to date,  in accordance with  the  PrimeMinisters instructions in 0.0.S. 114, the estimate of the cost of the  Singapore Basecirculated to the Committee of Imperial Defence in October 1926 (Paper 281-C).     2.   The statement deals only with  capital&apos; costs;  the  annual charges for themaintenance of the Base are  not included, as sufficient  material for estimating these is not yet available.Oil Fuel.  j   3.   The cost  of  providing  tankage for oil fuel at Singapore is also omitted fromthis statement,  but in fact the total already approved for  this service is                                     .....

The cost  of  the land for the Naval  and Air Base was  146,000.  The land was acquired by the Straits Settlements Government and handed over to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as a free gift.   Provision for the  purchase of  land required by the war department is included in the statement of cost of military  defences.Naval Repair Base.                                       .     5.   The cost of the Naval Repair and Storage Base  development scheme  remainsas  before  7,750,000, but  the date  of completion is  deferred till 1937.   A  briefdescription of this &quot;truncated scheme&quot; is given in Appendix (A) (identical with theprevious Appendix (A) ), and the incidence of cost now expected is shown in a newAppendix (B).  At present expenditure is on (a) berth for floating dock ;  (b) auxiliaryworks;  (c) preliminary works over the site of the base.  The approved total  estimate for this part of the  scheme (Vote TO)  is  712,000.  The  expenditure up to and including the 31st March, 1928,  is  493,241, and  the remaining cost-- 218,750-fallson 1928  and later years.   To  complete  the truncated scheme  by 1937 the totalexpenditure from 1928 onwards  is expected to be  6,423,759 on  works and  824,500on machinery.  A contract has  been let to Sir John Jackson (Limited), amounting to 3,721,474, for. a, considerable part of the truncated scheme.     It will be  recalled that the truncated scheme provides only for that part of the completed  scheme which requires more than eight years to develop, together with afew items which are necessary to enable the Floating Dock  and the facilities connectedwith it to be used.  A statement of the deferred requirements which woirid have to be&quot;taken in hand should  the Far Eastern  outlook develop unfavourably is  reproduced inAppendix (J).                                               &apos;&apos;Floating Dock.     6.

The cost of  the  Naval Defences is estimated at  107,500;  in addition storesto the value of  103,000 are expected  to be  used from  available stocks.   The first stage consists of an Anti-Submarine  boom  protecting  the entrance  to  the FleetAnchorage ;  the  second  stage chiefly of defences of Johore River and Keppel harbour and  local  patrol vessels.  The  anticipated expenditure  year  by year  is  shown inAppendix (C).                                                                   V:Wireless.     9.

The  scheme for the military  defences is  divided into two stages, and theestimate previously given provided for both of these.   The Cabinet have since decidedthat  only the first stage  of the plan of  defence shall be proceeded with for the timebeing, and further that the period of three years originally allowed for the completionof the first  stage shall be prolonged  by two  years, i.e.,  to  the end of the financialyear 1932.

It should foe noted that the figures embrace only the capital  cost of the construc-tional works at present anticipated.  They do not include provision for aircraft or themaintenance of air squadrons.     The scheme is designed to meet the following requirements :      (i.) The provision of  an aerodrome,  water  and  electric  supply and nucleus     5;  ;  storage and technical accommodation to  enable  aircraft to foe landed and           flown at Singapore.  Estimated  cost  260,000.   This stage of  the scheme           was  approved by the Cabinet on the 11th November, 1925 (C.I.D. Paper           No. 255-0).     (ii.) Provision  of accommodation for Fleet  Air Arm Units.   H.M.S. &quot;Hermes&quot;           will be employed on the China  Station and five aircraft will be  required           for embarkation in cruisers.   Shore accommodation is  required for storage           of reserve aircraft, for repairs and also to provide for Fleet aircraft being           disembarked up to two flights at any one time for flying practice  from the           shore aerodrome.  Estimated cost  236,000.     (iii.) It is proposed that the flight of Flying  Boats at present carrying out an           extended  cruise in Eastern waters shall on completion  of the cruise be         -  stationed  at  Singapore  in order to provide for coastal reconnaissance and           for naval co-operation with  the  naval forces in the Far East.   Estimated           cost   80,000.     (iv.) A flight of aircraft for spotting  duties with the heavy guns of the fixed            defences may be required, but the necessity for this provision remains for           discussion between the War Office and Air Ministiy.   No  expenditure  is           anticipated until 1934.  Estimated cost  25,000.     It must be understood that the scale of  technical and other accommodation whichwill be provided does not cover the full facilities which will be required  if the far eastern situation necessitates additional units of the Fleet Air Arm or further shore-based aircraft being based on Singapore.     If the political situation became threatening, it would be necessary  to provide additional  shore accommodation and possibly a  second aerodrome.  The initial costof these services might amount to  400,000- 500,000.Contributions toioards the Cost of the Scheme.     12.
