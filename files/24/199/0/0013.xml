[This Document is the Property of His  Britannic MajestyV Government. ]                 Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1928.SECRET.                                                &apos;     Copy No.                                                                         28CP. 363 (28).(Also Papers Nos.  C.I.D. 922-B,     R.L.A. (26) 91 and P.R.A. (27) 91.)CABINET.   INCLUSION OF AIRCRAFT AND AIRCRAFT ENGINES  IN  DRAFT      CONVENTION RELATING TO  THE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS,               AMMUNITION AND IMPLEMENTS OF WAR.               MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  AIR.      1.  I THINK it desirable, for purposes of formal record,  to circulate a short note explaining the  circumstances  in  which,  in  consultation with the  Acting Secretary of  State for Foreign Affairs, I  agreed  that our  representatives  at the recent  meeting.of  the  League of Nations  should depart in one respect from the recommendations of the Committee in regard to the Draft Convention relating to the Manufacture of Arms, Ammunition and  Implements of  War, contained in CP.  253  (28),  and  subsequently endorsed by the Cabinet  on  the 25th July (Cabinet 41 (28), Conclusion 7).     2.   The  question at issue  is the inclusion of aircraft.   My colleagues will recollect that  in their Report on this  subject it was recommended that aircraft and aircraft engines (Category IV) should  be  excluded  from the scope  of  the Draft Convention on the grounds that      (a.) It is not practicable to draw a satisfactory line between war-like and non-           war-like aircraft and engines.     (b.) If thej return should include both civil and military aircraft, it  would be           easy to deduce the numbers of aircraft maintained in  reserve for the Air           Force.     3.   When, however, the special  Committee appointed  by the Council of the League for the preparation of the Draft Convention assembled at Geneva, it became clear in the course of the discussion that the large majority of the  Governments represented were in favour of the inclusion of aircraft.  The French representative, in particular,  expressed the view (I quote from a despatch from Lord Cushendun of the 31st August) &quot; that  a  Convention designed  to control the manufacture of weapons of war would be of little value, if it left out of its scope the weapon which is likely to play the most important part in future warfare.&quot; Indeed, such hesitation did even those whom we might  have  expected to support our view of the matter (such as the Italians) display, that at one  time it  looked as if  we might be in a minority of one on the question.    4.  In these circumstances,  Lord Cushendun enquired as a  matter of urgencywhether some modification of the  attitude hitherto taken up  by the Air Ministry (and fully endorsed  by the Committee and the Cabinet) was not possible.    Whilst of  the opinion that, on the strict merits  of the  question, the arguments for the exclusion of aircraft from the Convention  had lost none of their force,  I feltthat they were not at this juncture of sufficient weight to justify our bringing about.an impasse in  the matter, more  particularly if ifcduld be ensured that returns ofmanufacture should be in terms of value only, and not of numbers or  weight.   Forsuch an impasse was likely to produce disproportionately dangerous and undesirable      [18511]
political repercussions, with Great Britain once again held up to the world (howeverunfairly) as the prime obstructor of disarmament.   Accordingly,,  as my colleagues were all absent from London and it was impossible to assemble the Committee at short notice to  discuss  the question, I informed  the Foreign Office  that  I  was prepared, to concur in our representatives at Geneva being authorised to  agree to theinclusion of aircraft and aircraft engines in the Draft Convention (subject only tothe stipulation above mentioned as to returns of manufacture being in terms of value),if they were satisfied, as the discussions proceeded, that the circumstances were such,from the political aspect, as to leave no other course open to them.    5.  This contingency did, in fact, arise, and at a meeting of the Third Committeeon  the  15th September our representative  (Mr. Cadogan) took advantage  of the discretion accorded to him rightly, in my opinion and, in reply to an attack bythe French  delegate which was obviously aimed at us, announced that, though our views on the merits of the question were unchanged,  we were prepared to with drawour objection to the inclusion of Category IV, stressing this further evidence of ourearnest desire in every way to assist the success of the Convention.                                                                       S. H.    Air Ministry, November 21, 1928.
