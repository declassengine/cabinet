CABINET.avaw;to.isr:.COMPENSATION FOR IRISH LOYALISTS.           MEMORANDUM BY  THE CHANCELLOR  OF THE  EXCHEQUER.     &apos; ,.-    1. . THE Dominions Office now estimate that it will probably require, from 50,000 to  70,000 in addition to the  1 million already provided to pay the awards of the Irish Grants  Committee on the scale announced,  in  February last  (up: to 1,000 in full, and 60 per cent, over  1,000).  I am bound reluctantly  to acquiesce in the additional amount required to pay claims on this scale, but I cannot recommend the Cabinet to agree  that all awards should be paid in full.  The Dominions Officeestimate that payment in full  may cost   1,400,000, but that it  is by no meansimpossible that this  sum may  be  exceeded.  In  fact, it  appears  that no reliableestimate can even yet be made,  and that the Cabinet,  in agreeing to pay awards infull, would be committing the Exchequer to expenditure of an  unknown  and possiblymuch larger amount.    2.  The question whether  the Committee&apos;s recommendations should be paid infull was exhaustively considered by the  Cabinet in  February, and the view  thenprevailed that a definite limit must be  fixed to the liabilities  of the Exchequer.  Inother words, it was decided to  provide against the contingency of the total awardsexceeding  1 million  by deciding that in that event a reduced payment must be madeon the larger claims.  This is exactly the contingency  which has now arisen.  Therecan be no justification in these circumstances for departing from that decision whichwas reached after full consideration,  and  announced to Parliament  as  the  finaldecision of the Government.    3.  I feel bound  to point out that the  Exchequer has been treated very badly inregard to this whole matter.  In July 1926 the Cabinet decided that the maximumwhich could be provided  to meet  the  Irish Grants Committee&apos;s recommendationswas  400,000,  and while  I agreed that this limit should  not be formally inserted in the Terms of Reference, it was  communicated  privately to the Committee.  TheSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs  at that time himself suggested that, ifthe total  awards  seriously exceeded that sum, it would  be  necessary to make a percentage reduction  so as to bring them within the amount.  In May 1927 he told the House of Commons that, while not prepared to pledge themselves,  the Govern-ment hoped to be able to pay the Committee&apos;s recommendations in full. After theCommittee had proceeded  further with its work, it became apparent that a far largersum would be required to pay the recommendations in full, and when the matter was before the  Cabinet in December 1927, it was estimated that the total awards would amount to about  1,160,000. The Dominions Office, however, subsequently expressedthe view that the amount would  be under  1 million, and on the basis of this estimate the House of Commons was informed  on the 20th February, 1928, that the totalcompensation  recommended by  the Committee might be approximately  1 million,and on the 23rd February, that it was believed that the total provision of  1 million would enable the  awards to be paid in full.  It now appears, however, that in reaching this estimate in February the Dominions Office  had made no allowance,or a very insufficient  allowance, for the additional claims  which resulted from  thedecision which had already been reached to extend the time limit for making claims from the  31st  January, 1927, to the 28th February,  1928.   This  has  resulted in1,096 fresh claims on which the Committee are  expected to make 540 additional      [18557]
awards, which will account for something like  250,000 of the total awards as now estimated.    Thus  the  Cabinet  have  had  before  them successive  estimates of  400,000,  1,000,000 and  1,400,000, and it is understood that no reliance canbe placed even on this last figure.  On the basis  of these utterly unreliable estimates,Parliament has twice been informed that it was hoped  that the awards would bepaid in full, and difficulty has thus been unnecessarily created in carrying out the considered policy of the Government to fix  a maximum limit for this expenditure.Nothing, however, has occurred to justify any departure from this essential principle,and indeed it has become more than ever clear  that it is necessary to adhere to thedecision that a fixed limit shall not be exceeded.    4.  It may be pointed out that on the basis of the estimates made  by theDominions Office the decision  to limit payments in  excess of  1,000 to 60 per cent.of the award will not in  any way affect some  85 per cent,  of the total number of awards which will  in any case be paid in full.  Of the remainder it is estimatedthat roughly two-thirds, or about 200 cases, would  get from 75 per cent, to 99 percent, of their award.  This leaves about 110 cases,  or only some 5 per cent, of thetotal number of the awards expected to be made, in which the effect of the limit is substantial.  If the limit is abolished, this small number of claimants would receivebetween them  the  bulk  of  the   400,000  or  more  of  new money  required  to implement all  the  awards in full.  Moreover, from  an  examination of typicalexamples,  it appears that the comparatively  few awards which would be reduced byadherence to the existing limits are chiefly cases of boycott or dispossession in whichthe losses  were indirect, and  the measure of compensation in  such cases must be largely a matter of opinion.                                                                   w. s.  c.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,                 December 3, 1928.
