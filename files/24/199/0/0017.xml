[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]  &quot;7 ^.    -  ^ .   . -  :&apos; Printed for the Cabinet,  November 192S. ;        ^i;;-&apos;:^r:q  -  .SECRET.CP. 367 (28).                             CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN  RELATIONS.   Memorandum  by the Secretary op  State for Dominion Affairs. 1;.    LORD CUSHENDUN has done well to circulate to his colleagues;Mr. Craigie&apos;s powerful and, indeed, convincing appeal  for a  searchingexamination of the present state of Anglo-American relations.   Thatthese relations constitute by far the most important and  critical element-in the whole of our foreign policy,: and  that there is no external menace to  our  existence  comparable  to that&apos; which  might  arise  from  the deterioration of those relations, may well be accepted.  At the same time; *I cannot help feeling that Mr.&apos;Craigie&apos;s&apos; statement, profound  as  is theinsight  it shows into American  psychology  and impressive  as  is  its-&apos;&apos;insistence upon American power, requires some correction in perspective.&apos;&apos;    Mr. Craigie in no degree exaggerates the  present  economic power of&quot;the United States as compared with the outside world.   Two-thirds of:the banking  resources of the world, two-thirds of its production  of oil,;cotton and wheat, half its production of  copper, iron and  steel, two-fifths of its production of lead and coal, a third of  all its railways  and electric power, not to speak of four-fifths  of its  motor vehicles, are concentrated&quot;in the  United  States.   The  purchasing  power of the  120 million&apos;Americans,  according to  Dr. Alberto-   Pirelli, the  president- of  the -International  Chamber  of Commerce,   is  greater  than that of  the-&apos;500 millions of Europe  and much  greater than that of 1,000 millionAsiatics.   Beside  this  giant of modern  large-scale: production  theindividual European  nations of  the   19th  century type;  are&apos;, merepygmies.  But we are not, or  at least need  not be, one  of  these  lessernations.   If the United  States are twenty-five times as  large  as  GreatBritain,  the  British  Empire  is more than  four  times  as large  as  the    (18517)Copy  No.- ES
 United -States, &quot;and has at least four times its  potential resources.-  As against, 105 million whites and 15. million coloured we can set&apos; 65 million whites, apd  nearly 400  million  coloured.  There  is  no inherent-reason why the British Empire should&apos; not be developed  into something as  far ahead of  the United States in economic power fifty years hence as they are ahead of Great Britain to-day.  That the British Empire  has stood still, relatively speaking,  during the past fifty years  while the United States have, advanced so amazingly is due  mainly to the fact that  we have had no economic policy for the Empire, and that the&apos;stimulating energies of  British finance, British migration  and of  the British market have mainly been devoted to helping  the development of foreign  countries and above all of the United States.    , The  only  real answer  to  the  American  menace  is the  economic lipbuilding  and consequent  closer and more effective  political unity of the  British  Empire.   Paced with  so terrible  a  danger and  so urgent a  need, the  timidity,  the half-heartedness, the &quot;indifference with which we have  hitherto treated the problem of Imperial  economic  policy is almost inconceivable.   Surely the time has  come when, even  if we are still paralysed by our fears  in  the matter of fiscal preference, we might&quot; at least use  our revenues and our credit with a little  more boldness to promote Empire trade and development;     Meanwhile, we have got to realise our present weakness, and  shape our  policy  so  as to  avoid  affording&quot; an  opportunity  to that  ruthless, aggressive ambition,  which  is no less real an element in the American character than the moral and pacific,  to be concentrated against ourselves; We need  not forget, in playing for time,  that  there  are other  objectives for that ambition which may well divert American thoughts and energies. Mexico, Central America, the whole sphere of the Monroe doctrine, may yet keep the United States well occupied for  the next generation-  -If, in. addition,  they also  get drawn  more  closely into the  Chinese chaos and thus increasingly embroiled with Japan, the American eagle may have all its work cut out to look after its own tail feathers.  These considerations, however,  Only  strengthen the case  for a general foreign policy which, without truckling to the United  States-^--such an attitude would be  fatal &quot; will naturally appeal to American sentiment and enlist American good- will and sympathy.     The  American conception  of the outside  world has, T think,  been profoundly, modified since the Great War.   The old idea of Great Britain as the ancient  oppressor, as the arch-Imperialist, land-grabbing, militarist Power has  largely  given way  to a more understanding interest in the British,Commonwealth  of to-day.  The part  played  by the Dominions in the  war,  the constitutional evolution&apos; in the  Empire since  then,  the creation of  the Irish Free State, have alb exercised their influence, while&apos;. Americans own experience in the Philippines  and in the West Indies, and writings such as those of Miss Mayo, have largely transformed  prejudice
against our.rule of subject peoples into sympathy and admiration.  Any-thing that we do in the direction of building up bur Commonwealth, evenif it involves - interference  with American trade,  appeals to  Americansas natural and reasonable.  So, too, any&quot;assertion of our power to main-tain our authority in regions remote from the Americas where civilisationdepends upon its exercise is not likely to arouse American  resentment orsuspicion.  I do  not believe,  whatever other  Powers  might  Say, that america would see anything unreasonable in our  giving the very widestand most emphatic, interpretation to  our Monroe doctrine  in the middle east, i A policy of Empire development, and even  of Empire ;expansion,on  lines  intelligible to American mentality, will  appeal to  Americansympathy as long as it does not directly cross America&apos;s own path.:  And,happily, there is no reason why it should.    On the  other  hand, the American is deeply  suspicious of policies which he does not understand, and, above all, suspicious of Europe.  Anysentimental  feeling  for France as  the  ally  of  long  ago  has  beenobliterated by the belief that Europe is the centre of old-world wickedness,of dishonest,, scheming diplomacy, of ferocious warfare,  of essentiallystupid,  uneconomic racial and  national rivalries.   America is convincedthat Europe is the disturber  of. the world&apos;s peace and full of rancouragainst everybody and against America in  particular.   The one unforgiv-able offence  we  can commit in her  eyes is to identify  ourselves with europe and, worse  still, to side wdth Europe against her.   The League ofNations  is,  by. the  majority  of Americans, regarded  as  the focus  ofEuropean intrigue, and  its Disarmament Commission  as a mere devicefor consolidating the dominant militarism of the day.  The Anglo-Frenchcompact was condemned because  it  was Anglo-French.   The Genevadiscussions might have ended very differently if they had  taken place in washington, London or  Ottawa.    There lies the real diplomatic issue that has got to  be faced franklyand upon which our decision  as to  policy must  be made.  I  have  nodoubt  as to. what is the  right  answer.   It  is, to adapt the famousBismarckian phrase, &quot; Los von Europa.&quot;   Our main business should be,as far as we can, to disentangle ourselves from Europe  and its rivalries.We are  too close and too  deeply committed to do so  altogether or toosuddenly, but that  should  be  the consistent aim of  our policy.  the locarno Treaties, following upon the rejection  of  the  Protocol, were astep in the right  direction, for they, in effect, whittled down our generalcommitments under the Peace Treaty and the Covenant  of the League,and by committing us equally, in theory, to both  France and Germany,committed  us,  in  fact, to  neither.  Getting involved  in  the  futilediscussions of  the  Geneva  Preparatory Commission was a step in  the wrong  direction,  and led almost inevitably to the unfortunate Anglo-French compromise.  After all, what  does, it really matter to us whatbasis  for naval  disarmament  is  acceptable to  France, or upon what
principles European military armaments.are, to be regulated?  The onlynaval armaments  that seriously concern  us  are those of America and,Japan.   The TiSnitSSy&apos; pSbTSIem ^^^&quot;^Seal^of^T^^^Qpe&apos;&apos;are  so&apos; utterlydifferent from ours that it is only a source of complication and confusion%$ns and to Europe to try and mix the two  together.  The breakdown of the Anglo-French compromise has offered us a way out.  We itremowin a position to tell Geneva that, as far as we are concerned, we are notprepared to discuss naval disarmament any further till we  have arrivedat a satisfactory basis of  agreement with  America, and that: as-regardsland and air armaments, while we no longer maintain our old objection on  the score of reserves,  we consider that  agreement could  be  moresatisfactorily reached without us.   1 believe  public opinion both  here,and still more throughout  the Empire, would be behind us  in such acommon-sense  conclusion, which  would  also  at  once : clear the  air inAmerica.    What  then should be  our next step over disarmament  with theUnited States ?  On general principle there&apos;is, no doubt, great  force in mr.  Craigie&apos;s  contention   that  any parity   agreement  acceptable to america in the near future, and calculated to  prevent the American Big&apos;Navy movement gaining fresh impetus; is worth making a great effort tosecure.   Even  if  such  a  parity involved an element  of strategicalinferiority, it might be worth facing in view of the fact that, in a war withthe United States, we should very probably not stand alone, and could also liberate a considerable part of our cruiser  strength by  gettingsupplies through  Europe, while  in  any  other war we should  have areasonable  margin of  superiority.  But  I have  no  doubt  that  theChancellor  of  the  Exchequer is right in deprecating  an immediatereopening of negotiations, at least until after Mr. Hoover&apos;s installationand our own General Election.  Mr. Coolidge is far too committed to hisdeliberate&quot; refusal to understand our last  proposals to be able to get backon to reasonable lines, and  the forces that misrepresented  our attitude,both  at  Geneva and more  recently,  are for the moment too much in theascendant,  Mr. Hoover may well wish to succeed where his predecessorfailed, and  time, and  a little effort on our part, may help the american public to. understand the  real nature of our  Geneva  proposals and theextent  to  which  our  subsequent  suggestion,  though  unfortunatelyintroduced,  in the  guise of, an Anglo-French  agreement, represented a genuine  attempt-,to  meet the American point of view as disclosed atGeneva.. .   ,      ,  -        &apos;    - ..-              -  -    , V      .        y   .    .     .     &apos;   ,  &apos;      &apos;         -   hi S.
