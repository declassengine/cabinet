Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.                                             Copy  No.    28CP.  371 (28).LIMITATION  OF NAVAL  ARMAMENTS.    I  CIRCULATE   for   consideration  by  the  Cabinet  draft  replies  to  theGovernments of the United States of America, Japan and Italy.                                                                       A. C.    Foreign Office, November 29. 1928.                   Draft Reply to United States Government.    HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain have  given  their most  carefulconsideration to the note from the Government of the United States, dated the28th September, 1928,  on the subject of the compromise proposals  put  forward byHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the French Republic relating tothe limitation of naval  armaments.    His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate the frank and friendly terms of that note.;,and are glad  to find that, although the Government of the United States are unableto accept the  proposals as a basis of discussion by the Preparatory  Commission forthe Disarmament  Conference, there is  nevertheless a large measure of agreementbetween them.   In  particular  they  agree in  holding  that limitation  of navalarmament, to  be really effective, should apply to all classes of combatant vessels.  It is hardly necessary to recall that the original proposals put forward by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at the meeting of the Preparatory Commission in March 1927, no lessthan those which they  advocated at the three-Power conference, were based on the division of warships into a number of categories embracing every kind of armedvessel.  Similarly,  the proposals which they submitted to the French Government inMarch 1928, while reducing the number of categories, still provided for the inclusionof all types of vessel.                                                         &apos;    The two Governments are further at one in their desire to abolish the submarinealtogether, or, if that  is unattainable, to  subject it to drastic limitation, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government  gladly reiterate their willingness to co-operate in any  steps which  the Government of the United States may he prepared to take  in order tosecure the largest measure of limitation of submarines acceptable to all the interestedPowers.    His Majesty&apos;s Government do  not, on the other hand, wholly share the viewthat, in the absence of  agreement on a complete scheme of limitation applicable toall types of combatant  vessels, a scheme of partial limitation would serve no useful purpose.  The  Washington Conference,  which  left several classes of  warshipsunlimited, is  a  signal example of the value of the method of proceeding by stages in this difficult matter.    It was with this consideration in mind  that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were prepared to make important concessions and to accept proposalswhich fell short of what they had themselves consistently advocated,  and  would have preferred.  In  considering these or other proposals for partial  limitation, it  mustbe borne in mind that,  inadequate as they may seem in  relation to  a hithertounattained ideal of comprehensive limitation, they may yet represent a  substantialadvance from the existing position, and it was from that point of  view that a partialextension of  the principle established at  Washington appeared to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be worth discussing at Geneva.    While, as they have been pleased to  note, there exists  between them and theGovernment of the United States an identity of views on many matters of principle,His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that on one point of substance,  namely, the classi-fication of cruisers, there remains a difference between the  views of the two Govern-       4672   [18537]                                                  B
merits which arises from diversity in the respective needs of the two countries.  Thepresent would not be  an appropriate occasion for  reopening  discussion  of thetechnical  points  involved  in  this  question, but His  Majesty&apos;s  Government arereluctant to believe that no way can be found for adjusting this difference in a mannersatisfactory to both Governments.   i His Majesty&apos;s  Government are no less anxious than the Government  of theUnited States that the special circumstances of individual Powers should receive due consideration,  and they share  the view that each  nation  is the  best  and onlyauthoritative judge of its particular needs.  His Majesty&apos;s Government,  who couldnot divest themselves  of any part of their own responsibility in this respect,  wouldbe the last to expect or desire others to do so. While, therefore, they can only regret that the Anglo-French proposals were considered  to be such as would  place theUnited  States  at a disadvantage,  they warmly welcome the assurance that theGovernment of the United States remain willing to use their best efforts towards an agreed basis of naval limitation.    For their part, His Majesty^s Government, deeply concerned at the failure toreach agreement hitherto on a general scheme for the limitation of armaments, will always  remain ready to consider fresh proposals.   They have taken note  of thesuggestion  made by the Government of the United States, and, although it  is onewhich they  are known  previously to have  rejected, they are willing  to examine  it again,  as they are willing to examine any other  suggestions which may be putforward with the view of promoting the cause of disarmament a cause which they regard as being of  supreme importance from both the national  and internationalstandpoints.                     Draft Reply to Japanese Government.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in  Great Britain desire to thank  the , JapaneseGovernment for their friendly and sympathetic reply to the note submitting for their consideration certain compromise proposals put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Government of the French Republic as a basis for the resumption of discussions in the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference.    His MajestyV Government  were much gratified  to learn that those proposals were  regarded  by  the Japanese  Government  as  successfully   reconciling thediscrepancies between theory and  practice existing in various proposals previouslyput forward, and were  accordingly considered by them to offer an  acceptable basisof discussion.   This fresh evidence of the keen desire consistently  displayed by theJapanese Government to assist in promoting agreement on a scheme for the limitationof armaments is a welcome encouragement for the future.    As the  Japanese Government are aware, the Anglo-French proposals  were a compromise  between two extreme theories that of limitation in separate categories of every type of combatant vessel, and  that  of limitation by  global  tonnage.  if his Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to  make the concession involved in their acceptance of a plan which fell short of what they had always advocated, it wassolely with the view of terminating the  deadlock  in  the Preparatory Commission.While  these proposals, in possessing the  advantage to which the Japanese Govern-ment  referred,  seemed  to offer  the prospect of a  considerable advance from theexisting position,  it was clear, as emphasised by  their authors in  putting  themforward, that it was only in the event of their proving acceptable to all the principalnavalPowers that they could lead to useful results.    Unfortunately, that condition has not been fulfilled, and the proposals  mustconsequently be regarded as having fallen to the ground.    Disappointed as they are, His Majesty&apos;s  Government do not abandon hope thata solution of this  all-important problem will be  found.  They remain willing toexamine, in a spirit of  the widest conciliation, any suggestion which may  be putforward, and they are happy to know that the sincere and helpful  collaboration ofthe Government of Japan will be steadfastly devoted to the same end.
                     . Draft Reply to Italian Government.         \ .\,.,.,    His Majesty&apos;s  Government in Great Britain desire to thank  the Governmentof Italy for their full and friendly reply to the note submitting for their considerationcertain compromise proposals  regarding the limitation of  naval  armaments putforward by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the French Republicas a basis for the resumption of discussions in the PreparatoryCommission, for theDisarmament Conference.    In courteously responding to the request for an expression of their opinion, theItalian Government prefaced their remarks by observing  that  they could neitherconcur in a separate  discussion of the  naval  question, nor regard the problem of disarmament as  limited to certain States only.  They went on to state their belief that they could detect a reflexion of these views in the proposals submitted to their consideration.    Their interpretation was correct:  the Anglo-French proposals were expresslyintended to provide a basis of discussion by the Preparatory Commission, and  thusfacilitate agreement on a scheme of comprehensive limitation of armaments acceptable to all  States.    The Italian Government further restated their preference  for the  method of limitation by global tonnage over that of limitation by categories.  The views whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government  have consistently  held on this point  are  well known.They  have in no way modified them;  and if in coming to the compromise with theFrench Government, they were prepared to accept limitation of a more  restrictednumber of classes than they had always advocated, it was solely in the hope that theirconcession might serve to terminate the deadlock in the Preparatory Commission andsmooth the path of general agreement.    While His Majesty.&apos;s Government regret that the Anglo-French proposals werenot considered by the Italian Government to offer a useful basis of further discussion,they share their opinion that any scheme of limitation, to be successful in attaining the ultimate aim in view, must be such as will enable each nation to give its voluntary and loyal adherence.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government much  appreciate the friendlyexpressions  of the  desire of the  Italian  Government  to co-operate  in  furtherendeavours to find a solution of the problem, and in particular they desire to thankthem for the concrete suggestion which they put forward to the effect that the Powerssignatories of  the Washington Treaty might agree to postpone until after the  year1936 the construction of  the capital ships  which they are  permitted by the treaty to lay dowmduring the period 1931-36.   This suggestion is one of particular  interestto His Majesty&apos;s Government in that it somewhat resembles  proposals which  theylaid before the three-Power  conference last year, and to which they still attach thegreatest importance.    Disappointed  as they are at the  failure of the compromise proposals,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government do not abandon  hope that a solution  of this all-importantproblem will be found.  They remain willing to examine,  in a spirit of  the widestconciliation, any suggestions which  may be put forward,  and  they are  happy toknow  that the sincere and helpful  collaboration of the Government  of Italy will besteadfastly devoted to the same end.
