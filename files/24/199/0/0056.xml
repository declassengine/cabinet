THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the following papers in  connec-tion with the Garrison of the Sudan :     A despatch from Lord Lloyd covering a despatch from the Governor-General of         the Sudan in regard to the question of the incidence of cost of the  British         Garrison.             (C.I.D. Paper  No. 838-B.)    A despatch from His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Egypt covering a Report         by the Governor-General of the  Sudan on the operations carried out in the         Sudan between the  8th December, 1927,  and the 7th February, 1928.             (C.I.D. Paper  No. 903-B.)    A despatch from His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Egypt covering a Report         by the Governor-General of the Sudan on the use  of the Air arm in the         Sudan.             (C.I.D. Paper  No. 904-B.)    A Memorandum by  the Secretary of State  for Air covering a Memorandum by         the Air Staff on the use of the Air Arm in the Sudan.             (C.I.D. Paper  No. 911-B.)    A letter  from the Foreign Office  to the Treasury in regard  to the incidence of         cost  of the British Garrison in  the Sudan.             (C.I.D. Paper  No. 914-B.)    A Note by the Secretary of State for  War covering a Memorandum by the Chief         of the Imperial General  Staff on the  composition of the Garrison in the         Sudan.             (C.I.D. Paper No. 915-B.)    A summary of the previous conclusions in regard to the Garrison of the Sudan,        and of the above papers, by the Secretary.            (C.I.D.  Paper No. 917-B.)    SIR GEORGE MILNE said  that the infantry Garrison in the Sudan had a two-fold  responsibility, first, to, ensure the security of Khartoum  against a risingof malcontents in Omdurman,  and a possible recurrence of trouble in the  SudanDefence Force, both of which were not unlikely  consequences  of any Mahdist risingon a  large scale;  and,  secondly,  to  protect the line  of  communication betweenKhartoum and the sea, and notably the Atbara  Bridge  and workshops   Neither of      [18606-6]
these responsibilities could be undertaken by the Sudan Defence Force. : GeneralHuddleston, the responsible Military Officer on the spot, held the view that one battalion of British Infantry was insufficient for these duties, and regarded one anda half battalions as an irreducible minimum.  He  (Sir George Milne)  had gonecarefully  into this matter  with General  Huddleston, and  endorsed  his  views.Sir John Maffey, on the other hand, now thought that one battalion was adequate.     SIR RONALD LINDSAY observed that Lord Lloyd had expressed agreementwith Sir John Maffey on this point.   . MR. CHURCHILL suggested that the Infantry Garrison might be allowed toremain as at present constituted for the time being, and that  the whole question should be again reviewed in six months&apos; time,  after  Air power had been further developed in that country.                                CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a.) To recommend to the Cabinet that the British garrison of the Sudan should          remain  at  its present strength,  viz.,  two  battalions Infantry,  and          one squadron Royal Air Force, for a further period of six months;  and          that, at the end of this period, the question should be  re-examined by the          Committee of Imperial Defence.    (b.) That the papers  in regard to the incidence of cost of the British  Garrison,          namely, C.I.D. Papers Nos. 838-B and 914-B, should be referred  to the          Cabinet.         *          *           *           *           *           *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,     December 13, 1928.

No.  J 2894/763/16]            :        &apos;        Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain.-(Received  October 18.)Sir,                              5, Portland Place, London, October 17, 1927.    I HAVE the honour to forward herewith the copy of a despatch received fromthe Governor-General of the Sudan, relative to the Cabinet decision of the 13th Julyof this year, in respect of the cost of the squadron of Royal Air Force to be located in the Sudan.    At  a meeting  of the Committee of Imperial Defence which I attended on  the7th July, I requested that any question of  financial obligation on the part of  theSudan in respect of the air force squadron to be located there should be reserved for future consideration, and I understood that the request made was agreed to.    It will be seen from the accompanying despatch what were the reasons whichprompted my reservation in respect of cost, and I trust that these may now be takeninto consideration.                                                             I have, &amp;c.                                                                  LLOYD.                                 ENCLOSURE.                         Sir J. Maffey to Lord Lloyd.                                     Sudan Government London, Office,My Lord,                                           London, October 17, 1927.    I HAVE the honour to acknowledge your secret despatch No. 209 of the 30thJuly/1927, enclosing a copy of Foreign Office despatch No. 678 of the 21st July, 1927,in which the Cabinet decision of the 13th July, 1927, is recorded.    2.  My views on the question at issue have been fully explained to your Lordshipin my despatch No. 66 of the 12th April,  1927.  Nevertheless, as the Cabinet hasdecided that for the purpose  of providing  a full and thorough trial of the efficacyof air forces in relation to the defence requirements  of  the  Sudan, a  completesquadron of the Royal Air Force shall be located in the Sudan for one year, I will do all that  is in my  power to enable such trial to be  carried out effectively, and reserve my further observations until it is completed.    3.  I note that the Cabinet has decided that the difference between the cost ofmaintenance in the Sudan and at home of  the British military garrison and of theproposed squadron Royal Air Force should be defrayed by a non-interest-bearingloan to the  Sudan Government from His  Majesty&apos;s Government, such loan  to be repaid when the Sudan Government is in a position to do so.  I have already fully informed your  Lordship  (in  my despatch  referred  to  above) of  my views on thefinancial competence of the Sudan and  the danger of accumulating a heavy load of debt for non-productive services.    4;  Your Lordship will, moreover, appreciate the difficulties which would arise in connection with the prior claims of the Egyptian Government if the Sudan were       [18621]
ato consider repayment of any such loan to His Majesty&apos;s Government.  The case onthis point might be stated somewhat as follows :     The demand for a contribution to the  cost of the British garrison is of recentorigin and was never thought of before the crisis of 1924.   It cannot be  said thatreasonable British expectations will be disappointed if no contribution is made;    On the other hand, it may well be claimed by the Egyptian Government that ithas had reasonable expectations of getting interest  on  the  advances which it hasmade in the past to the Sudan, at least as soon as the Sudan could afford to pay.While it would be justifiable in present conditions to argue that the time  when theSudan can afford to pay had not yet arrived, nevertheless, if before this time doesarrive His Majesty&apos;s  Government  were to  step in and postpone it to  a still more distant  future by superimposing new demands which had never before been thought of, this  would give the Egyptian Government a ground of complaint which could notbe ignored and might prove most embarrassing.  Moreover, the establishment of  a claim of the  special nature now put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government,  viz.,a claim for the extra cost of maintenance of troops in the Sudan, would ipso factoput the Egyptian Government into the position of increasing its own claims to  avery high figure.  At present there are three possible headings under which a claimcould be made by Egypt      (a.) Advances to the Sudan Government to finance capital undertakings,  such          as the railways, Port Sudan, &amp;c.     (&amp;.) Contributions to budget deficits in early years.     (c.) The extra cost of maintaining the Egyptian army in the Sudan.    As regards (a), it has generally  been recognised that the Sudan  ought to acknowledge this as a debt-the understanding being that it should start to  payinterest when it  could  afford  to  do so;  The  amount  involved is   E. 5,414,525,without taking into account accrued, interest.    As regards (&amp;), it might be possible to argue that this was a legitimate burden on egypt.  The amount involved  is  E. 2,871,811.    As regards &quot;(c), the Egyptian Government always made a record in its printedaccounts of an amount reckoned as the extra cost involved in maintaining part of itsarmy in the Sudan, and must,  therefore, regard this as a potential claim against theSudan  Government.   The  full cost of  the  local army was borne by the  egyptian government up to the end  of February 1925, after which the annual subvention of E. 750,000  started.   The  actual  amount  of the  claim recorded in the  Egyptianaccounts up to the end  of March 1923 under this heading was  E. 5,870,690 and up to the end of February 1925 would be about  E. 6,900,000.     It is certain that if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to establish  a claim for the extra cost of maintaining  the British garrison,  Egypt would press its claims inrespect of items (5) and (c)  above, and these it would be difficult to resist.  The net result is that a claim by the British Government would force the  Sudan to recognisea debt for  E. 5,414,525 in respect of item (a), and would precipitate possible claims for nearly  E. 10,000,000  in respect of items (b)  and (c).  Apart from this, it is hardly  to be supposed that Egypt would continue to pay  E. 750,000 per annumtowards the military expenditure of the Sudan, if  E. 80,000 of this was being usedto relieve the British Government.    :5.   This question of the  financial responsibility of the Sudan Government is,of course, a  separate issue from that of the maintenance  of a squadron Royal AirForce,  and must be considered whatever the decision as  to  the squadron may be.Nevertheless, as the whole question of the military garrison of  the  Sudan is,according to the decision of the Cabinet, to be reconsidered at the end of a year&apos;strial, with the squadron, it appears to me best, if your Lordship  agrees, to deferany argument on the financial issue until then.  I trust that I may then receive your lordship&apos;s support in pressing for a financial settlement less open to objection thanthat proposed by the Cabinet.  At  present I feel it necessary  at least to reservemy position on the matter,  and not to allow any assumption  of tacit acquiescence on my part to be made.   i.                              I have, &amp;c.                                      J. L.  MAFFEY,                                              Governor-General of the Sudan.

Copy of a Letter from the Foreign Office to the Treasury.[No. J 2942/16/16.]Sir,                                             Foreign Office, October 22, 1928.     I  AM directed  by Lord  Cushendun  to  acknowledge the receipt, of your letterNo. S 26902/3 of  the 22nd August last regarding the action to be taken to give effectto the Cabinet decision* of the 13th July, 1927 (Cabinet 40  (27) ), that the differencebetween the cost of maintenance in the Sudan  and at home of the military garrison andof the Air Force  squadron should be defrayed by a non-interest bearing loan to  theSudan Government from  the  Home Government, such  loan to  be  repaid  when  theSudan Government is in a position to do so.     2.  As the Lords Commissioners of  His Majesty&apos;s  Treasury will recall, it wasdecided at a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 19th December, 1927,that a despatch from Sir John Maffey of the 17th October, 1927, in which he indicatedsome of the difficulties to which the application  of  the Cabinet decision referred toabove would give rise, should betaken into account  when the whole question of  thegarrisoning of the Sudau was re-examined during the current autumn.     3.  It has, however,  proved impracticable in the  short time available beforeSir John  Maffey  returns to the Sudan  to arrange for a meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence  at which the question of the British garrison in the Sudan and  thecognate one of financial responsibility for its cost could be re-examined.     4.  Lord Cushendun, however, has had an opportunity of going into the matterpersonally with Sir John  Maffey and he is impressed by the serious nature of  thepolitical complications which  an  early application of the Cabinet decision referred toin the first paragraph of this letter might easily produce.  As Sir John Maffey pointedout in his  despatchf of  the 17th October, 1927, to  which  reference is made above, theEgyptian  Government have always debited against the Sudan Government an annualamount supposed  to  represent the additional  cost of  maintaining the Egyptian Armyin the Sudan over that which would have been  incurred had it remained in Egypt.The total amount thus debited up  to the time  of  the  withdrawal of the  egyptian army  at  the end of February 1925 is about  E. 7,000,000  (seven million  Egyptianpounds),   exclusive  of  accrued  interest.  Since  that  date  the annual  subsidy of E. 750,000 (seven hundred and fifty thousand Egyptian pounds) paid  by Egypt to theSudan has in the  Egyptian view  been on.  account of the military expenditure of theSudan.  Although the Sudan Government are  not prepared to admit their liability to repay it, the Egyptian Government have never renounced their claim to regard it as adebt due,  and this view has been vigorously expressed not merely in successive sessions               * Cabinet 40 (27), Conclusion 1, and C.I.D./230th Meeting, Minute 8.               t Enclosure to C.I.D. Paper No. 838-B.       [18365]  [18622].
of the Egyptian Parliament, hut also in those of the Legislative Assembly which used totake place before the War.  It is evident that the position taken up by the Sudan Govern-ment in refusing to admit, liability towards Egypt under this heading will be materiallyweakened if a precisely similar obligation to refund the additional cost of maintaining the British garrison in the Sudan is admitted.  As things are, His Majesty ?s Governmentare  on  strong ground in  supporting the Sudan  Government  in repudiating  theEgyptian claim, since up to the withdrawal of the Egyptian Army no  claim  whatever,whether  in respect  of maintenance or of work  services, was  made  b3r His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  on the Sudan Government  during the twenty-five years that a british garrison  was maintained  in the Sudan.     5.   The funded debt of the Sudan Government, on which interest is already paid and sinking fund payments will commence next year, already amounts in round figures to  E. 16,000,000  sixteen million Egyptian  pounds).    In addition to this there is  theobligation  to repay to Egypt the amount of the so-called development loan amountingin round figures  to   E. 5,500,000 (five and a  half million Egyptian pounds).   At  thetime this was contracted,  the Sudan undertook to commence  interest and sinking fundpayments as soon as this  could  be done without prejudicing the financial stability ofthe country, and their liability in this  respect is not disputed by the Sudan Govern-ment.   These obligations  are in themselves  sufficiently   onerous  when regard  ishad to  the  fact that only  seven  years have elapsed since  the  financial positionof the Sudan was  so  serious that  for a time it appeared  probable that  the Gezirascheme  would  have to be  abandoned, in which  event a default on the  7,000,000(seven millions sterling) already borrowed under Treasury guarantee  would have beeninevitable   The fact that careful nursing and a  succession  of  abundant cotton  cropstogether  with the payment over  a  period of  four years of a cash subvention at therate of  E. no,OO0 (three-quarters of  a million  Egyptian  pounds) annually by  theEgyptian Government has enabled  the  present relatively favourable  financial positionto be attained, is indeed  a matter  for congratulation.  But the polilical stability  ofthe Sudan, which is a pre-requisite of financial stability, depends  on the progressive reduction of the present high rate of taxation.  The accompanying copy of  a despatchof the 6th instant. from  the Acting High  Commissioner for Egypt and  the Sudanindicates that considerations of financial realism may not improbably come to outweighthose of  political  sentiment so far as the Egyptian  Government is concerned.   Itwould, therefore, be unwise to reckon  on the  indefinite continuance of  the Egyptiansubvention, as  a  threat on the part of His  Majesty&apos;s Governments to  denounce theAnglo-Egyptian Agreement  of 1899 in the event of  default  might well fail in  its immediate  object and would be difficult to justify before world opinion;     6.   Sir John  Maffey&apos;s view, in which Lord Cushendun concurs, is  that the firstconsideration of the Sudan Government should be  not only tp avoid increasing the already heavy burden of  Sudan indebtedness  but  also to ensure that ample provision is available for the service of the funded debt1  and that an early opportunity should betaken of  effecting a settlement with  Egypt in regard to the Sudan indebtedness to thatcountry   Such a settlement, which  may ultimately have to  be  sought by arbitration,will, as has been shown above, be rendered  more  difficult if immediate effect is givento the Cabinet decision of  last year; and Lord  Cusheudun, therefore, considers that action  under it should be suspended for another year when the matter can be further considered.   In  the  meantime, however,  and  without  prejudice  to  any  futurecontribution  towards the  cost of  the British  garrison, Sir John Maffey is prepared tomeet the reasonable requirements both of the Army and the Royal Air Force in respectof work services in the Sudan.  He  is also satisfied  that the political situation in thatcountry will now admit of the reduction of the British garrison by one battalion, whichwill materially reduce its cost.     7.   Copies of this letter have been sent to the War Office, Air Ministry and theCommittee of Imperial Defence.                                                         I am, &amp;c.                                               (Signed)        JOHN  MURRAY.
* Not priuted.t O.I.D. Paper No. 802-B.t G.I.D. Paper No. H38-B.(No. 742.)My Lord,                                 The Residency, Ramleh, October 6, 1928.     I  HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship&apos;s secret despatch no. 875* (J 2472/16/16) of the 20th August, forwarding the proposals of His Majesty&apos;sTreasury for giving effect to last year&apos;s decision of the Cabinet relative to the incidence of the  cost of the British garrison in the Sudan.     2.    I observe from your Lordship&apos;s despatch No. 885* of the 30th August that theseproposals have been communicated to Lord Lloyd and to Sir John Maffey, who will nodoubt continue to urge the considerations developed in His Lordship&apos;s despatch  No. 2551of the  27th April, 1927, and in his letter (J 2894/763/16$) of the 17th October of  thesame year and its enclosure.   The Acting Governor-General of the Sudan, whom I have consulted as  requested, considers that, in  view of this  fact,  he cannot appropriatelycomment on the Treasury&apos;s proposals at the present juncture.     3.   Nor  can I myself add much to the weighty arguments in favour of a reversal of the  Cabinefs decision contained in the despatches to which 1 have referred.  Iwould  suggest, however, that Egypt&apos;s present tendency to reaffirm, at every opportunity and in  every  available way, including the payment of her contribution  to the defenceof the  Sudan, her  sovereign  rights there  may not necessarily be permanent   the inconvenience which her aspirations in this direction cause us  are  outweighed  by  thefinancial advantages which they  bring, and some  day she might by  a disconcerting-lapse into realism decide that  it was better worth her while to stop the contribution and endeavour to recover interest on the  Sudan loans, giving us  as a quid pro quo  theabandonment of her political  claims.  I  feel that insistence on  the  present  proposal will tend to turn the thoughts of Egyptians in this direction.   Egyptian loans (as  theGovernor-General has pointed out) constitute a prior  claim,  the  assertion of whichwould  defer almost  indefinitely the settlement of that of His Majesty&apos;s  Government.                                          I have,  &amp;c.                                 (Signed)      R. H. HOARE,                                                      Acting High Commissioner.
