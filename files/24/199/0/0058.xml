0&apos;1  ( THIS DOOmiEIM IS  3BE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ABET C MA JE 3 JETS  GOVEBUMENT) .                   CABINET.        OIL  FUEL  RESERVE  FOR  BIE  NAVY.     Note of Agreement between the Chancellor of the     Exchequer and the First Lord of the Admiralty                as to expenditure in 1929.          I ask the Cabinet to take note of the fact thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have discussed the.question of the progress to be made in 1929 towards thecompletion of the approved Reserve of Oil Fuel for the Navy,and that it has been agreed that the quantity of Oil Fuelto be added shall be the same as in the present year, viac,100,000 tons.   As regards storage, it has been agreed thata sum of  15,000 shall be included in the Estimates to begin the construction of the tankage that would be requiredin the event of approval being given next year to theaddition of the normal instalment of 320;,000 tons of Oil in1920, but that the orders for this tankage will not beactually placed without further consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer.          So far as I am concerned, this agreement has beenreached on the understanding that the Cabinet, as last year,realise and take responsibility for the fact that the progressthat is being made in the completion of this vital Reserve is.for financial reasons, being retarded much beyond the limit which the Board, of Admiralty think safe or which the strictestinterpretation of the Cabinet ruling on the subject of theImprobability of a major war can justify.SEC RES.QaP,410, (28).(INTD.)   w;0,B.Adum ralty.18th December 192 8.
