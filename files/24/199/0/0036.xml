(Received 20th November, 1928.)                        ,     (No. 9).           Office of the High Commissioner for Great Britain,Sir,                                              Ottawa, 5th  November,  1928.  ;       Mr. Mackenzie King arrived at Quebec on  the evening of the  27th October onhis return from Europe and on the following day addressed a large audience in that cityin a  speech which  dealt mainly with the events in which he has  participated during his absence from Canada.   After  describing the purpose of his visit to Europe as being tocarry a message  of peace  and goodwill,  he referred in terms of praise to the Pact  of paris, noting the significance of M. Streseman&apos;s presence.   Turning to the activities  ofthe League of Nations,  he  congratulated himself on having been able to point out as an example to the Old World the unfortified frontier between Canada and the United Statesof America and the methods of conciliation and arbitration which have been successful in settling disputes between them.   He called  upon the Churches to co-operate in thecause of international peace and denounced the damage done to this Cause by irrespon-sible  and unintelligent criticism of  their neighbours  both by  countries and indi-viduals.  Speaking of his  audience with His Majesty The King, he referred with greatappreciation to the interest shown by His Majesty in all matters concerning Canada andto the proof he received of His  Majesty having followed them  in minute detail.  Theoccasion, he said, was of particular importance because  &quot; it is &quot;the first &quot;occasion onwhich a Prime Minister of Canada has discussed with, the  Sovereign those matters  of concern to the Dominion, just as the British Prime Minister discusses with him those matters affecting  Great Britain.&quot;  His concluding remarks dealt with the opening  ofthe CanadawLegation at Paris and were devoted principally &quot;to eulogies of Mr. Roy.     2.  There was, perhaps,  little in his speech to provoke&quot;newspaper comment, butit may be of interest to note  that the passage  referring to  the shining example &quot;to&quot; theOld  World provided by the harmonious relations; of Canada and  the United; States&quot; ofAmerica a theme sufficiently familiar in the  speechesofthe- Canadian&apos;&quot;delegates &quot;atGeneva has not escaped severe  treatment from the Toronto Globe \TL &amp; leading-articleunder the title &quot;New World  Nonsense.&quot;   Canada  and the United States of America,argues the writer,  have not as  such and alone worked out any magic formula for peace between themselves.  The peace between them, creditable as it is, has been and stillis peace between the British Empire  and the United States  of America.   No good can come of misrepresenting the realities- -of -the situation-,-- especially when the inference  tobe drawn is  that  Great  Britain, in common with the rest of the Old World, belongs to a lower and.more  sinful  order of mankind.  The writer concludes &quot;by&quot;drawing attentionto the favoured position, which Canada enjoys under-the  Monroe-doctrine  and from theexistence of the British Fleet  &quot;  which the  doctrine of intra Empire autonomy forcesothers to pay for,&quot; and  deplores&apos;the symptoms of Canada&quot;&apos;being led--by the  UnitedStates of America into  adopting a pharisaical. attitude- towards Europe.     3.  The Prime Minister reached Ottawa by train at noon,on the 29th October andwas  accorded a  civic reception.   Members of the&apos; Dominion-Cabinet,-&apos;Diplomatic and consular  representatives  of   foreign countries-, -and-the  civic authorities of Ottawagathered to  welcome him  at the  railway station, and&apos; I was present with the membersof my staff.  There were further ceremonies which  I attended at the City Hall, whereMr.  Mackenzie King delivered a short  speech devoted chiefly .to  civic  topics, moreparticularly  the beautification  of Ottawa.   The Federal Improvement Commission haslarge schemes in  hand, in which the Prime Minister takes an active personal interest.-These will involve the  demolition of a  number of existing buildings in the vicinity of Parliament Square, and among them, I understand, the hall in which he was speaking a  substantial building but an unfortunate example of mid-Victorian municipal architectural-tecture.  Reference to this particular feature  of  the schemes  was not unnaturallyavoided, and the Prime Minister gave no hint  of an ultimate intention to bow himselfupon the pillars of the  house.     4.  I feel that  the return of the Prime Minister marks a definite  commencementto my activities here.  When I saw him at Plymouth in August he suggested that thebest results would be obtained if I moved slowly in the interval between my arrival andConst. Rel.ns.-Gp. 6.  75/1999.   3.  125. 12/28.  (1197) M. &amp;.S.
his return to Canada.  He undoubtedly intends to take a personal interest in promoting the effectiveness of the High Commissioner in the work of co-operation and consultation,and was anxious that this work, so far as his Government are concerned should starton the right lines under his own eye.  The absence of most of the Dominion ministers from Ottawa during the last six weeks, the necessity of acquiring some familiarity with local conditions and current questions, and, not least, the inconveniences arising fromthe necessary re-decoration of these offices, have made it comparatively easy not to be tempted into premature  activity in official relations  with the  Dominion Government.During this period of initiation there has, of course, been plenty to do. especially in theorganisation of the work and the  office; and I feel that the  interval has been useful in that it has enabled the  Mission to gain a good foothold,  both in the official and socialspheres, before launching into the full tide of its future work.                     -  ;.-    5.  My official launching may  be  said to have taken  place  at a  dinner whichthe  Prime Minister, on behalf of  the Canadian Government,  gave in  my honour onthe  night of Saturday the 3rd November.  Mr. Lapointe, the Acting Prime Minister,had approached me through  Dr. Skelton some weeks previously to ascertain whether had any preference as to the date for such  an official dinner and they were goodenough to put  the matter in such a way that, on various grounds, I was able at once toavoid any implication of disrespect  to the Acting Prime Minister and to agree with themupon  a date subsequent  to the Prime Minister&apos;s return.   I thought then; and I am sure now that  the result has justified my view- that such disadvantages as there mightbe in not following up the publicity given to my appointment on my  arrival wouldprobably be more than compensated by the greater weight and authority attaching to anything which the Prime Minister might say by way of welcome and definition of myfunctions.   The dinner  took place at  the Country Club,  which,  as you  may haveobserved,  Sir, during your visits to  this Capital, enjoys a certain popularity  for such functions not unconnected with the fact that, lying just within the borders of Quebec,it provides an  escape from the rigours of the Ontario liquor laws.   No one, I venture to think, could have wished for a  more cordial welcome than was  given in the PrimeMinister&apos;s speech on this occasion, or for better evidence of  the atmosphere  of good-will in which this  Mission  will begin  its work.  Mr. Bennett, the Leader of theOpposition, endorsed, on, behalf of his party, the words of the Prime Minister, which,he said represented on &quot;this  occasion the voice of all Canadians  without  distinctionof race or party.  Telegrams were also read from Mr.  Larkin,  Mr. Massey, andMr. Boy.   It  may be of interest if I enclose the accompanying  extracts from thePress giving an account of the proceedings and reports&apos; of the speeches delivered on this occasion, including the speech which I made in reply.   N                                                    I  have,  &amp;c,                                                                W. H. CLARK.                              Enclosure 1 in No.          EXTRACT FROM The Montreal Gazette OF 5TH NOVEMBER, 1928.               SIR WILLIAM  CLARK &quot;GIVEN WELCOME BY DOMINION.             Official Greetings Made on Behalf of People of Canada.                              Function at Ottawa.    Premier and Opposition Leader Speak at Dinner Cabinet Members Present.                             (Special  to the Gazette.)       OTTAWA, 4th November. A warm welcome, on behalf of the Canadian people,Avas given to Sir William Clark, first British High Commissioner to Canada, and LadyClark,  by the Canadian  Government at a  dinner  last evening,  over which presidedPremier Mackenzie King.  Most of the Cabinet Ministers and all the members  of theSupreme Court of  Canada were  present,  also Hon.  R. B. Bennett,  Leader of theOpposition; Sir Robert Borden, Members of  the Senate,  Hon. William Phillips, UnitedStates Minister, and consular representatives of foreign countries.    Displaying the fruits of his training at Eton and Cambridge and  the breadth ofhis experience in the British permanent civil service, both at home and in many partsof the Empire, Sir  William Clark, in a speech marked by civil Wisdom,  subtle humour,and the command of clear and  persuasive language, passed in quick but comprehensive review the developments in inter-Imperial relations culminating in the  appointment to canada of a.High  Commissioner from Great Britain.
  .  &quot;The  British peoples,&quot; said Sir  William,  &quot;  may fairly, claim, that, they have evolved a philosophy of Empire which places our commonwealth in.a wholly different category from other great political aggregations of the past.   Liberty is its fundamental principle,, its essential aim.   Each government pursues it within its own.borders;. it is the ideal of  His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in the exercise of their respbnsi- bility for that part of the Empire which is still held in  trust.   And in the  autonomous group the principle has been carried to its logical conclusion,  each member being, and  intending to remain,  a free unit, self-contained and self-controlled, but  through mutual co-operation, through common allegiance to the Crown,   a unit in a greater unity.&quot;                          .     In  addition to the development  along  constitutional and  political  lines there was  a recognition by Great Britain, said Sir William, that there was a. wide and fruitful field of co-operation in the economic sphere in matters of trade,  finance,  migration and  the rest, &quot; all rich in possibilities, all interlocking one with the other.&quot;   Beferring particularly  to the  question of immigration Sir William said, &quot;  I am sure  of this, especially after the Prime Minister&apos;s emphatic assurance in that eloquent speech of his two  or three weeks ago in London, that  it  is as much the  desire  of Canada to see a larger proportion  of her immigrants come  from Great Britain as it  is  our desire to send them to her. With that spirit  on either side, co-operation should indeed  be easy to attain.       There is  a famous  line of  a Roman poet which comes naturally to the mind when one speaks of migration : &apos; They change their skies but not their  mind who hurry across the  seas.&apos;  That is wholly true, though in a sense very different  from the poefs, of. those who leaving their homes and their native land and traversing the waste  of seas, come to  dwell, perhaps thousands  of miles away, but  in a country which still forms part of the same Empire as their own.  They  change their skies indeed,  but they need- not change  their mind,  for  they find there people speaking the same  language, living under similar laws, maintaining similar  standards, holding to  similar traditions as themselves.&quot;                                         -                            Welcome by Premier King.   .  Premier King,  in welcoming  Sir William and Lady Clark to  Canada,  alluded to the fact that almost the first person to greet him (the Prime Minister)  when he landed at Plymouth over two months ago was Sir William,  and said he had hoped to  be able to reciprocate to that, extent in person when Sir William landed  at Quebec,  but  his absence at Geneva made this impossible., The Prime Minister gave considerable time to a recital  of the facts of Sir William&apos;s career  and concluded it by reading, from the letter of Bt.  Hon. Mr. Amery, Secretary of State, for the Dominions, who highly recom- mended Sir  William to the post he now  holds..     Stress was laid by Premier  King  on the historical significance  of Sir William Clark&apos;s position  and appointment  as the  first British High Commissioner to Canada. &quot; I believe  it is,&quot; said the Prime Minister,  &quot;by far the most  important step that has been taken  to further effective consultation and co-operation between  the Government of His Majesty in the Dominion of Canada- and the Government  of His Majesty in Great Britain, with resultant  benefits to  both,  and, what is even more  important, to the unity of the  Empire as a whole, the most effective means thus  far devised of securing the Crown against involvement, in&apos; any possible controversy which  may arise between different  Governments of which His  Majesty  is the head.   If closer  relations of the Governments of  the Empire and the maintenance of its unity through the security of the Crown are what we all desire,  may we not truly say  that here they  find their surest as well as their, latest. development ?&quot;     Hon. R. B. Bennett, leader of the Opposition in  the  House  of  Commons, in a brief but eloquent address,  echoed the expression of welcome  of the  Prime Minister, and  paid a  high tribute, incidentally, to the efficiency, integrity  and loyalty of thepermanent civil service of Great Britain, a service which had made possible the present high state of proficiency in the trade commissionerships and  even in the diplomatic&apos; service.  Preservation of the solidarity of the  Empire was one of the highest aims and purposes of  public men, as that solidarity was the world&apos;s surest guarantee of peace.     Before introducing Sir William, the Prime Minister read brief messages of welcome sent  to the  dinner by Hon. P. 0. Larkin,. Canadian High  Commissioner in London;Hon. Vincent Massey, Canadian Minister  at Washington,  and Hon.  Philippe Roy,Canadian Minister.at. Paris.   -                                                   \                           Sir William Clark&apos;s Address.     Sir William Clark spoke as follows :      &quot; You who  have been born,  most of You&apos;, I suppose,  and lived the greater partof your lives in Canada, perhaps hardly realise how impressive a country  she is to one
 who comes to her,, as I do, for the first time from overseas.  I am not.thinking so much, for the moment, of her political achievements, of the lead which she has taken through-. out in  the, development  of the conception of Empire, as we now know it, or even of. her natural loveliness, of the splendour of the approach.to her by that wonderful river which forms, I imagine, as noble a gateway to  a great continent as  is to be found anywhere in the world.   &apos;  -     &quot;I was thinking of her rather from the standpoint from which for the  last ten years  at the  Department of  Overseas trade in London,  I have had  to look at  the world the standpoint of economic prosperity  or its  reverse, of purchasing capacity and its promise of growth or decline. From that standpoint how impressive is Canada&apos;S: record! In  area  one of the  greatest countries in the world,  she is now the.world&apos;s greatest exporter of the world&apos;s most essential foodstuff.  .- Not, content with agriculture, she  has become  a notable   producer  of  manufactured goods;  she is now second only to the United  States in the volume of electrical power she generates, no mean index  of industrial activity.   In the figures  of  her total  trade she comes fifth, among the nations.                                                                 &apos;      ,     &apos;&apos;  With  all this, and with her  immense mineral resources,  she is  already one of; the wealthy and will soon be one of the wealthiest nations in a world where wealth is. an essential constituent of power.   She is fortunate in her people who have done all this her people who&apos; are derived  from  two races, which have each left their mark on history; for  she alone among all the countries in the world has at  her disposal, side by side,  the traditional qualities of the British people and the culture, quick intelli- gence,  and versatility of  France-     &quot; One may venture  the criticism that her  people-might with advantage be more in number, but at least they can point in answer  to the immensity of their achievements -the  cities they have built,  the railways they have  constructed, the vast tracts of land they have brought under cultivation--until this year, aided by nature  in -one of her more bountiful moods, they have produced  a  crop of close on one billion  bushels of grain.  These are facts, no doubt, which are  there in the reference libraries for all to read whether they have visited Canada- or not; are they not written, most of them, in the pages of  her Year Book?  But a  first  glimpse of her confirms them:   Canada looks.her&apos;job young,^vigorous, with the future in her hands.   It is indeed something to look forward to that one&apos;s work for the,next  five years will be in a country of such superabundant and diversified promise.                           Growth of Self-Government. .     &quot; This is a new post which I  am taking up,  but  it has a long history behind, it,. the history of the gradual, inevitable development of the  doctrine of self-government. Slow at. first,  that development has  attained a-certain liveliness  in the last 20 years.  I select that  date  because,  perhaps alone of  those  assembled in this room, I attended just over 20  years ago the debates of a conference  which marked, in  its  way,  the end of an epoch, the last of the Colonial Conferences,- that of  1907.   I  was there, I. hasten to add, in a very humble capacity, as  private secretary,  sitting behind the chair of Mr. Lloyd  George, while, with an artistry all his own  he managed, at one and the :; same  time, to oppose a resolution  on  Imperial preference and to create almost as amiable an atmosphere as if  he had accepted  it.  And  I  listened  there not only to those familiar accents, but also for the first time to the mellow eloquence of the states- man who has left behind him so great a name in Canadian history, Sir Wilfrid Laurier. That Conference marked  something of an epoch,  for in.the course of its discussion itmodified its constitution and assumed for the future the larger Imperial  title.   After that,  events,  as  we know, moved quickly.     &quot; Four years later the Dominion Prime Ministers were, for the first time, admitted to arcana imperil, the inner mysteries of foreign  policy. Then came the war, and after it, the recognition that equality of sacrifice and  equality of service to the Allied cause gave to the Dominions the right to equality of status in the negotiations for  the terms. of peace and in the constitution of the League of Nations.  Canada took the  lead in those matters, and again two or three years later when she signed that  treaty which has  made   hippoglossUs  vulgaris the  common  halibut an  important  landmark in Imperial history.  And so we come to the Imperial Conference of 1926, and, one of its incidental  consequences, my presence here  to-night, if I may modestly associate myself  with the halibut  as one of  the minor milestones on that long highway which has led from  the colonial status of a century ago  to the full autonomy of to-day.                             Bri.tain&apos;s Outlook Wider.     &quot; The progress may have seemed to you sometimes unduly slow,  but at  least it may be said  of our  people in Great Britain  that they have accepted the quickly cul-
urinating; developments since the war with unquestioning approval-and that;, perhaps,is not without significance when coming from a race so conservative,, so tenacious oftradition, so adverse to change.  But Britain&apos;s outlook, her conception of her responsi-bilities and needs, have greatly widened.  She has travelled a long way it is hardlynecessary to say it-from the days of. placid indifference to the ultimate destiny of herpossessions overseas; and if our people  approve, as they do approve, these changes,it is not only because they recognise that full equality of status belongs now by  rightto the Dominions in virtue of the  nationhood which  they  have achieved, but  also because  they see in it the  surest guarantee for the future  maintenance of Imperialunity.  In particular, it commends itself to those who have pondered over what is notthe least  difficult of our problems-the  problem of how to conduct  the international affairs of an  Empire which  covers one-fourth of the world&apos;s surface and whose  com-ponent countries, scattered over the  four quarters of the globe, have  necessarily,  eachof them, diverse interests and responsibilities of their own.   Situated as  she  is, within twenty miles of the&apos; Continent, but  separated from it by the sea, Great  Britain  is atone and the same time in Europe but not of it.   Her foreign policy, traditionally andof necessity, is closely concerned with  Europe, just as yours is with the great  and friendly nation across your  border.     &quot; Great Britain must have constant regard to the vital lines Of communication,which link her to India and her other possessions in  Asia, and to her territories in Eastand West Africa; you, on the  other hand, in. the western hemisphere are not directly concerned with the international problems which centre around the eastward communica-tions  of the Empire; your chief preoccupations are  necessarily your relations with thegreat republic to the south,  and with the Empire  across the Pacific.  Australia  andNew Zealand and the Union of South Africa each have  their  own special interests and problems.  No solution could be adequate in such circumstances which did not give to each member of the autonomous group liberty of action where their own individualinterests are concerned, subject only to the obligation,  equally incumbent upon all, of having constant regard to how such action may affect the interests of the other partners.     &quot; But the  changes we have seen since the war have clone much more that that they have brought it-about that each Dominion now takes an equal part with the mother country in the issues of&quot; major importance affecting the Empire as a whole-such issues as disarmament, the work  of the League  of Nations,  and the progress of the continuousstream of effort towards securing the peace&apos; of the wOrld. They&apos; are&apos;not merely as &quot;inthe past, informed or consulted, they are actual and active partners.   So the solutionhas been found by bringing  apparent extremes together securing the fullest  solidarityfor the whole by giving the  fullest liberty and equality  to each part.  If one required a new motto for the Empire it would be  1 liberty, equality, and co-operation.&apos;     &quot; There may, of course, be differences  of opinion,  from time to time, and  adjust-ments which will have to be made to meet them, but when this has been done there  willbe not only a common policy which has beyond  all question the support  of  each  and,every member  of the Commonwealth,  but what is  scarcely less important, it will be&apos;manifest beyond all question to the  world that  the policy represents  indeed the  aimsnot of one government or people of the  Empire but of each  and all of its autonomousnations.  That will surely  mean for the Empire an even greater prestige and  influence in world affairs than has been hers in the  past.  In the days before the war, there were those who, not knowing, doubted how the Dominions would act in that supreme  resort,and indeed had begun to  believe  that when the  test came, they would be tempted to stand aside. They were grievously mistaken, as none know better than you in Canada,but such misunderstandings, with all that they may involve, could not have arisen if therehad been  then, as there will be now, closer  contacts between the governments of the.Dominions and the governments of foreign states, or if it had been known then, as it will-be now, that the Dominions have a full voice in the  framing of imperial policy.                              Empire&apos;s Unanimity.     &apos;&apos; I thought of these things a few weeks ago as I stood on the tender in PlymouthSound waiting for the great ship to round the western promontory which was bringing the Prime Minister of Canada on a journey of three  thousand  miles to  sign the Pact ofPeace.  What clearer gesture could there be of where Canada  stood on that momentous-issue? Or for those who watched the signature of- the  Pact in the Salle de THorloge,&quot;  how:indicative of the whole Empire&apos;s unanimity in the cause that now matters most of allthe causes in the world, that six representatives, each holding  plenary powers  from theKing should one after the other have affixed their signatures on behalf of their respectivepeoples.   It is no longer one note that is struck  but the full&apos;chord.
-     &quot; No reasonable man will contend that the declaration of 1926 has solved all theproblems of Empire.  It has solved some, it has doubtless left others untouched; it may even have created difficulties of its own legal complexities, practical difficulties in theconduct of  business  between - Governments,   difficulties  of - consultation  and inter-communication,  which, for that matter,  have always  existed,  but which  have nowassumed a greaterlmportance.  In the debates at  that Imperial Conference of twenty years ago to which I have already  referred, the Prime  Minister  of  New Zealandreproached  the British Government in that Great  Britain,  a great commercial nation,had no representative in his Dominion to deal with questions of trade other than theGovernor-General who, in.the nature of things, could hardly come down into the marketplace.   He  pointed out  that  in commercial  questions  foreign  countries and foreignexporters were represented by  their consuls, whereas there was no British official to help the British merchant  and  manufacturer or  to bring his  needs to  the  notice of theDominion Ministers.  The British Government accepted the suggestion on the spot, and before the  end of the Conference were able to announce the beginning of that trade commissioner Service which, as no one knows better than myself, has done such admir-able work in the furthering of Inter-Imperial trade.  The Trade Commissioners havebeen in a  position  to render such service because they have been  on the  spot; ableto get into touch where governments have been concerned with the appropriate ministers and  officials; able  to  tell us  at home from their fuller knowledge how things andconditions really are.  The  analogy  applies also in the political sphere.     &apos;&apos; You have for 50 years had a Canadian High Commissioner in London, and I hopeyou feel as I do that the time has  fully come when there  should  be  a  British HighCommissioner in Ottawa.   I am not going to be so foolish or arrogant as  to suggestthat my appointment will eliminate the barriers of space and time and alt the difficultiesthey involve; but at least it will introduce into the relations between the two govern-ments, on this side of the sea now, as well as on the other, that personal element whichexperience has shown is so important in the handling  of affairs.  I can only  say that itwill be my earnest  endeavour to win from you that confidence which my Governmentwere good enough  to place in me when they chose me for so  high  a mission.   IfI should succeed in  that,  my task will indeed  be more than half  done.   For within theCommonwealth the  root, of the matter surely lies,  not in technicalities of internationallaw or constitutional precedent, but rather, to borrow that vivid phrase which the PrimeMinister of Great Britain used in your city last year, &apos;  in the living relationship.&apos;which  exists between us.  And it is through mutual confidence and co-operation whichwill flow from it that that living&quot; relationship will be justified by its fruits.                              Philosophy of Empire. .     &quot; In  the meantime  the British  peoples may fairly  claim that they have evolveda philosophy of  Empire which places our commonwealth in a wholly different  categoryfrom other great political aggregations of the past.  Liberty  is its fundamental principle,its essential aim.  Each Government pursues it within its  own borders; it is.the idealof His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in the exercise of their responsibility forthat part of the Empire which is still held in trust.  And in the autonomous  groupthe principle has been carried to its logical conclusion, each member being, and intending to remain,  a  free  unit,  self-contained and  self-controlled, but through mutual co-operation, through  common allegiance  to the Crown, a unit in a greater unity. .       I have spoken of  political relations, but there remains also a wide and fruitfulfield of co-operation in the  economic  sphere in matters of trade,  finance, migrationand the rest, all rich in possibilities,  all interlocking one with another.   It is a field ofimmense importance to two  countries such as Canada and Great Britain, each, in theirdifferent degrees, so dependent for their  prosperity on the successful marketing oftheir produce and manufactures; each with their own problems, veiy divergent problemsindeed, of population and employment.  To me it is not wholly unfamiliar ground, andone of the things I look forward to is this, that I shall  now be able to study it from this side as well as  from the  other, through the eyes of those who,  in the last few years,have brought Canada to so high a crest of  prosperity.     &quot; I must not embark to-night on  so large a  theme, but perhaps I may say thismuch  about one corner of  it.  Ever since, some  four or  five years ago, I was firstassociated in England with the work  of our  Oversea Settlement Department, whosefunction it is to promote emigration  within the Empire, it  has always seemed to  me a real defect  in our organisation that, in dealing  with  a subject  where governments oheither  side are so closely concerned,  the British  Government had  no representative in Canada  who  could  advise those responsible  in England  and could discuss  with the
appropriate authorities here openings for settlement, or difficulties&apos;and-obstacles imped-ing it, and could help to remove misunderstandings.   I even on occasions-advocatedsuch an appointment with a zeal which I might have moderated had  I known that themantle of this responsible and sometimes perhaps delicate function was destined to fall upon my own shoulders.   But after-all, I do not  regret it, for there are few subjectsjust now of greater interest in the problems and possibilities which it presents.    &quot; And I am sure of this, especially after the Prime Ministers emphatic assurance inthat eloquent speech of his two or three weeks ago in London, that-  it is as much thedesire of Canada to see a  larger proportion of her  immigrants come from Great britain as it is our desire to send them to her.   With that spirit on either side, co-operation should indeed be easy to attain.    &quot; There is  a  famous line  of  a Roman  poet  which comes naturally to the mindwhen  one speaks of migration :  &apos; Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt.&apos;(&apos; They change their  skies but  not their mind  who hurry across the seas/)   That is wholly true, though in a  sense  very different from the poefs, of  those who,  leavingtheir homes and their native land and traversing the waste of  seas, come to dwell,perhaps thousands of  miles away, but in a country which still forms  part of the sameEmpire as their own.  They change their skies indeed, but they need not change theirmind,  for they find their people speaking in the same language, living under similar laws,maintaining similar  standards, holding to  similar traditions as themselves.    &quot; I find much encouragement in this thought now that I am embarking on mynew work among you in Canada.  Differences of opinion may well arise between our twogovernments; indeed, were.it  not so, the British people on either side of the oceanmight well be thought to have lost something of that independence of spirit in which they take a legitimate and traditional pride.  But above and beyond such divergencies therewill always be,  I believe and I am sure you will share in  the belief an identity ofoutlook,  a community of aim,  which can only ai:ise between two peoples  who oweallegiance to  the same King, who hold in common so many memories of the past,  so many  aspirations for the  future.&quot;                           Premier King&apos;s Address.    Following formal words of  welcome to Sir William and Lady Clark,  Premier Kingsaid, in part:                                                         ,          - .    &quot;It  is  unnecessary  that I should remind  you of the historic significance, whichattaches to the  appointment by  His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of a High-Commissioner in Canada.  It is equally unnecessary that I should refer  at any lengthto Sir William Clark&apos;s eminent fitness  adequately to discharge the great responsibilities of his  high position, and the correspondingly great  opportunities of far-reaching service which it affords.  It is pleasant, however, at  this  moment, to recall some of the mile-stones of a career which  had its beginning, in both training  and achievement, at Etonand Cambridge,  and which has been  conspicuous for its variety and usefulness bothin Great Britain and in the outposts of the  Empire.  I do not know that I could do this in a manner which  would  be  more gratifying to  all present and to Sir WilliamClark himself than by reading a  portion of a letter which I received in March last fromMr. Amery,  the Secretary of State for the Dominions, at which time  I was advised by-Mr. Amery of the contemplated appointment of Sir  William Clark to the position of PlighCommissioner,  and of Sir  William3s exceptional qualifications  for  that  position.    &quot; After  remarking that it had been  by  no means easy  to find a man who wouldpossess all the qualifications which had been discussed so fully at the time of Mr. Amery&apos;visit to Ottawa^ Mr. Amen? went on to say that someone had  been found who, not onlyin his opinion,  but also  in that of the Prime Minister and  Sir Austen  Chamberlain,combined a general knowledge of the  various departments  of the British Government,.which had been urged as important from the  point of view  of business,  with wide experience in other directions, and a personality which more  than qualified  him for the-post.  In his letter Colonel Amery goes on to say :                          Man of Unique  Experience.    &quot; The man we have found is Sir William  Clark, at present Comptroller-Generalof the Department of Overseas  Trade.  His all-round experience is  almost unique  inthe service.  He began in the  Board of Trade, but served for some time under theForeign Office in China,  and in  his present department is also partially responsible  tothe Foreign  Office.  On his return from China  to the Board  of Trade he was  private secretary, in succession,  to Lloyd George and Churchill in  that office  and to Lloyd
George  when he was  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  a position which brought himnaturally  into contact  with every department of government and with a very  widecircle outside.  From 1910-1916 he was member for commerce and industry on theCouncil of the Viceroy of India.   In his present office he has not only had to dealregularly  with the Foreign Office and. Board of Trade, but he has been closely kept in touch with Dominion affairs, partly through the trade commissioners who have beenunder him,  partly also owing  to  the fact  that he was  closely concerned  with theWembley  Exhibition, and has also  sat regularly as  a member of the Overseas Settle-ment Committee  and of  the Empire Marketing Board.  Add to this wide  range  of experience an attractive personality, a real gift of speech and a very charming wife,and I think you will agree that we have got something at any rate not far short of thesuperman whom  such  an office  requires.&quot;     Having  paid his compliments  to Lady  Clark,  Colonel Amery then goes . on  topay a little compliment to  myself, and concludes:      &quot; &apos; I am sure you yourself will like him as a man of culture and wide sympathies,and find him  in every way  of real assistance in the despatch of business.&apos;        &apos;   &apos;     &quot; Being thus reminded of Sir William 01ark&apos;s achievements, and having come toknow him as we already have,  even in the few weeks of his presence  in the capital,I am sure we  are all prepared to say that we have  reason to be deeply gratifiedin the selection which has  been  made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in  Great britain of its first High Commissioner to Canada.     &quot;I referred a moment ago to the historic significance attaching to the appoint-ment of a representative of the Government of Great  Britain, as distinguished fromthe appointment by  the Crown  of  a representative of His Majesty the King in theperson of  His Excellency the Governor-General.  May I,  in  concluding what I haveto say,  speak for a few  moments  of this aspect of our inter-imperial  relations.                            Permanent Representative.      In  1879 the Government of Sir John A. Macdonald felt that the time had arrivedwhen the interests of Canada demanded the permanent presence in London of a repre-sentative of the Government of Canada to safeguard and further Canadian interests in-the British Isles.  The, Government had had in London, prior to that time,,a  FinancialAgent, but Sir John was of the view that what was required was the presence of some-one with the  status of a Minister who would act on  instructions from his Governmentand would be able to speak with authority, on his Governments behalf. . Two matters in particular were referred to by Sir John as necessitating, in  the interests of Canada,more effective representation of the Government in London: the  question  of trade,involving negotiation of commercial treaties, and immigration.  These, however, &quot;werebut two, of the many interests of Canada which it was felt demanded more effectiverepresentation in the Old  Land.   Accordingly, a  representative  was  appointed  torepresent in London the interests of the Government, but was not, however, for reasons which I need not go into for the moment, styled a Minister.  He  was designated HighCommissioner.     &quot; The first person to  be appointed  to  the office  of  High Commissioner was sir alexander Gait, whose appointment was  made in the year 1880.   He was succeeded in 1884 by Sir Charles Tupper, who, in turn, was succeeded in 1896 by Lord Strath-cona. . Lord  Strathcona&apos;s. successor was  Sir George Perley,.who is with us  to-night,and who held that highly responsible  position during the very difficult  and strenuousperiod of  the war.   Sir  George was  succeeded, in  1922 by  the present High  Com-missioner, the Honourable Peter Larkin.  All of these gentlemen, each of whom bearsa distinguished name, represented the Government of Canada.  They did not, however,represent  the Crown or the Crown plus the Government, and this  for the very obviousreason that the Crown, in respect of His  Majesty&apos;s Dominion of Canada, while repre-sented&apos;:&apos;in  Canada by the  Governor-General required  no representative in  London,being&apos;there represented by  the Sovereign himself, or as in the days of Queen  Victoria,by Her  Majesty the  Queen.                            Method in Colonial Days.     &quot;Coming now to the representation in Canada of the Crown and of the Governmentof Great Britain, it will be recalled that in colonial days both functions were combinedin the person of the governors  or  governors-general who came  to the  Provinces-ofCanada, just  as they  are combined to-day in. the existing colonies  in other parts of theEmpire  in the person of their governors.   When, however, the several&apos;colonies which-went to make up British North  America  were federated  in a single Dominion,  therecame into being a more complete development  of self-government  and an emergence
 of nationhood, which wrought-a vital change in the position of the governor-general. More and more the governor-general came, to be. exclusively the  representative of His Majesty the King, and less and  less the representative or agent of the Government of Great;Britain,  as distinguished.from the Crown or the  Crown,plus the Government.     &quot; One result of- this evolution has  been that more and more,  in our  Dominion,. the position of the Governor-General in relation to the administration of public affairs,. in other words in relation to the people and the Government, has  come, in all essential respects, to be identical with that held  in Great  Britain by His Majesty the King in. relation to the administration of public  affairs in the British Isles.   In other words, the Governor-General has become in Canada in  the truest, and largest sense of the word,  the  personal representative of the Sovereign.   Another consequence,, but one of an opposite character, which has resulted from this evolution, has. been that while the position of Governor-General has gained in dignity and authority  as that of the personal representative of His  Majesty  the  King, the  representation of  the  British Government  as distinguished  from  that of.the Crown  has suffered a corresponding diminution, and this at a time when its interests in Canada are  greater than they have ever hitherto been.  It was to &quot;meet this situation, the more important the more it is considered, that the British Government decided  at the  Imperial Conference of  1920 to have its interests in Canada safeguarded and  furthered by the  appointment of a High  Commissioner.                          .    .                             Not Sole Responsibility.     &quot; But the representation in Canada of the; interests of the Government of Great Britain  is  not  the only responsibility of Great Britain&apos;s High Commissioner  in our Dominion.  He will have another and perhaps even greater responsibility, that, namely, of promoting consultation and co-operation between the Governments of Great Britain and Canada in  all matters which are of mutual interest or concern.   That consultation and co-operation will relate not  alone to questions of trade, immigration and finance, but also to these all-important  matters  which arise  out of  inter-imperial  and  inter- national relations.  Here let me  say that especially in large matters. of this kind, where consultation is  all-essential and where decisions frequently have to be reached without delay,  too much importance cannot be attached to the value  of personal contact.  To&apos; my mind despatches between  Governments should be the last  and  not  the  first word in important negotiations.  An understanding of the exact meaning  and intent of the other party, and of the atmosphere in which he lives and moves  and has his being is all-essential to an appreciation  of what may or  may not be  possible in  any  given situation at any given  time.   This can be  made  known  to a Government by its own representative,  resident at the seat of Government elsewhere as it can never be made known by correspondence between principals.     &quot; Nowhere more than in inter-imperial  and international relations  is it true that &apos; the letter killeth but the spirit maketh whole.&apos;   To see  from my.office window on an adjoining side of Parliament Square a building which I know to be  that of the represen- tative of the Government of Great Britain, with whom,  at a moment&apos;s notice, I can confer,  or  who,  at a moment&apos;s notice,-  can  confer with me;  to know that we  are known to each other, and that he, resident here, can learn for himself at  first hand some of the considerations and problems of which the Government of Canada  has totake account, and interpret them to his own  Government in words which  it would be impossible  to place in despatches,  and that  all this can be effected without directly or indirectly involving the Crown or its representative in any possible difference of opinion or  controversy, cannot,  as I expressed it in a conversation  with  Sir William Clark  yesterday, be other than deeply comforting to one charged with my responsi-biliti.es,  and riot less an advantage to  the  Government whose interests it is his highprivilege to represent.&quot;                             Enclosure 2 in No.           EXTRACT FROM The Montreal Gazette OF 6TH NOVEMBER, 1928.                              SIR WILLIAM CLARK.                               R       The address delivered by the new British High Commissioner at  the welcometendered by the Canadian Government on Saturday was in every, respect worthy of theoccasion and of the.man.   Sir William Clark&apos;s peculiar fitness for the office to whichhe has been appointed has been emphasised, notably in the letter quoted by the PrimeMinister from the Secretary of State for the Dominions; he has had a long and compre-hensive training in the atmosphere of diplomacy and in the practical business of govern-
merit.  He knows, from personal contact and participation, extending back over twenty-years or more he attended the &quot; last of the Colonial Conferences &quot;in 1907 what is meant by the development and evolution of Imperial relations.  He understands perhaps;better than the volunteer dogmatists in this country and  elsewhere what exactly has.been the character and trend of that evolution and development, the extent of it, and itslimitations.    He  recalls, with a graceful tribute to &quot;the mellow eloquence &quot;of SirWilfrid Laurier,  the modification  of the  constitution of the Conference  in 1907, theassumption  of the larger Imperial title, and the  admission, four years afterwards, ofthe Dominion Prime Ministers to the inner  mysteries of foreign  policy.   The right toequality of status came,  he  says, after the war, as a recognition  of equality of serviceand of sacrifice.   This is a  point that seems of some importance and  worthy of somereflection, because there has been a disposition recently to date  equality  of status, orwhatever  is implied by that term,  back to  a  later period, and to.-find&apos;for it anotherorigin.  If the Conference of  1926 did anything  it reduced to some sort of formula a development which had already occurred, and applied the term  &quot; equality of status,&quot;which is more or less misleading.  . Into that phase of  the question, however, Sir WilliamClark does not go; it is a matter of controversy.-  It  is worth while noting, at the sametime,  that in suggesting a  new Empire motto he  includes  &quot;  co-operation &quot;  with&quot; liberty &quot;  and &quot; equality.&quot;  There may be, he says, differences of  opinion from timeto time, necessitating adjustments, but when these  have  been  made  &quot; there  will benot only a common policy which has beyond all question the support  of each and  every member of the Commonwealth, but, what is  scarcely less important, it will be manifestbeyond all question to the world that the policy represents indeed the aims not of one government or people of the Empire, but of  each and all of its autonomous nations.&quot;    Equality within the Empire is regarded by Sir William Clark as a  means of securingthe fullest solidarity.  Whether that idea has been dominant always in the minds  of all who have  preached and  proclaimed equality of status is  a question which  has arisenupon  one  or two occasions  within  the last  two or three  years,  and may arise  again.It  does not  call for discussion now, but those who are concerned in it will find fromSir William Clark&apos;s very able address that  he stresses, and properly, the intent thatautonomy shall enhance  rather than  weaken the unity of the Empire.  He does notpretend that all  Empire  problems have been solved, or that the Conference  of 1926did not leave some problems untouched, did  not, indeed, create some legal complexitiesand practical difficulties  in the transaction  of business between  governments,  but hewould subordinate the technicalities of international  law or of constitutional precedentto the &quot; living relationship &quot; described by Premier Baldwin, a living relationship whosefruits will be mutual confidence and co-operation.  It is a  fine ideal, but no finer thanthat which the vast majority of Canadians have always cherished in their attitude towardthe Motherland and the sister Dominions.   It is  expressed in what  Sir William  Clarkdescribes as the British  people&apos;s philosophy of Empire,  with  liberty as its essentialprinciple,  with each autonomous part of the Empire a free unit &quot; self-contained and self-controlled,  but through mutual co-operation, through common allegiance to theCrown, a unit in a greater unity.&quot;   Again he says that differences of opinion may arise between governments, but above these he sees  an identity  of outlook, a community ofaim and he  leaves his subject there.   He strikes a high note, one that is in. harmony with the aspirations of the Canadian people, and his  address leaves the conviction that sir William Clark &apos;s presence and work in Canada will do  much to promote that com-munity of thought and interest, and that unity of action which equality of status, despite the notions of some of its exponents, may be made to serve.                          Enclosure 3 in No.        EXTRACT FROM La Presse (Montreal) OF THE 6TH NOVEMBER, 1928.                             POUR  Nous  ENTR&apos;AIDER.    Le discours prononce  a Ottawa  par  sir William Clark, en reponse a la bienvenueofficielle que le premier ministre,  l&apos;hon. Mackenzie King, lui a souhaitee au nom dupeuple canadien,  n&apos;aura pas manque de creer une excellente impression a travers leDominion.   Le premier haut  commissaire d&apos;Angleterre  au Canada nous apparait deplus en plus comme un homme aux vues larges, au sens pratique, bien au courant dece qu&apos;on exige de lui et tout a fait dispose  a raccornplir dans rinteret de la metropoleet de  notre pays.    Ce qui  a manque jusqu&apos;ici,  et  il ne faut en accuser personne, c&apos;est  le contactdirect, le  tete-a-tete,  si Ton peut dire,  entre  la Grande-Bretagne et nous.  Pareillesituation,  prejudiciable assurement aux deux  parties, n&apos;existera  plus desormais.-  Sir
William  Clark, si  then qualifie pour remplir  ce  role  important,  devient un agentsuperieur de liaison, 1&apos;interprete ofnciel du peuple anglais aupres du peuple canadien,de meme que l&apos;hon. P. C. Larkin, notre haut commissaire la-bas, se charge d&apos;exposerles vues et les besoins des citoyens du Canada aux autorites et aux populations de notremere patrie.  L&apos;element personnel qui faisait defaut se trouve constitue et on a droit de s&apos;attendre, comme on l&apos;a dit, qu&apos;il servira heureusement a rendre les relations entre les  deux pays plus vivantes, plus fdcondes que dans le passe.     Les particuliers trouvent avantage a  se recontrer et a discuter les questions  quiles  interessant : pourquoi les nations  n&apos;en  feraient-elles pas  autant?   Surtout entredeux contrees  eloignees  1&apos;une  de 1&apos;autre, comme  le  sont  la  Grande-Bretagne et- leCanada,  il est bon, il est necessaire de choisir des representants officiels dont la  missionconsistera a dissiper les  malentendus, s&apos;il en surgit,  et, d&apos;une maniere  generale, aindiquer aux deux peuples  comment ils  peuvent s&apos;entr&apos;aider mutuellement.   sir william   Clark  a mentionne  le commerce  et  1&apos;immigration.   II  est maints  autresproblemes dont 1&apos;etude directe et immediate par les hauts  commissaires et les gouverne-ments britannique et canadien rendra certes la solution plus  facile et plus satisfaisante.     Notons cette partie du discours de sir William Clark  ou  il parle de 1&apos; avantage dontjouit le  Canada de posseder une population composee des representants de  deux racesqui ont  laisse leur marque dans 1&apos;histoire  de la  civilisation.  &quot; Seule dans le monde,explique-t-il, la  nation  canadienne   peut  disposer,  jointes  ensemble,  des qualitestraditionnelles du peuple anglais et de la culture,  de  1&apos;esprit vif et d&apos;adaptation promptedu peuple francais.5&apos;  En effet,  notre pays devrait tirer de cette situation des elementsde succes, de prosperite  et d&apos;influence.     Nous avons confiamce que la venue parmi nous de sir William Clark marquera uneere nouvelle dans les  relations  de la Grande-Bretagne et du Canada.  Le haut com-missaire  anglais trouvera dans la province de Quebec, pour le  moins autant que dansles  autres provinces, un  gouvernement et une  population prets a  cooperer avec luidans 1&apos;interet commun.
