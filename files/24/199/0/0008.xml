&quot;This  Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]     &apos;&apos;         Printedt for the Cabinet.  November 1928.SECRET.                                             Copy  No.   28CP.  358  (28).                             CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN  RELATIONS.         MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF  THE EXCHEQUER.   - &apos;                                  ^    IF the essay by Mr. Craigie on Anglo-American relations, which lord cushendun has  circulated (CP. 344  (28)), has no other  object than  toinculcate meekness  and caution,  it  need  not  be  dealt  with  indetail.   But  if  it  is  intended  as  a  prelude  to renewed  Navalnegotiations - with  the  United States  during  Mr.  Coolidge&apos;s  tenure,I am  decidedly of opinion  that  this  would be a great mistake.  Weshall  never agree among ourselves  either to abandon our belligerent rights at sea or to cut the British Navy  down by treaty to the limits which theUnited States considers suitable for herself.  Any attempt to enforce suchan agreement would divide the Conservative Party from end to end on the eve of the Election.   There would  be  a  stand-up  fight  in  all the constituencies  on the question of whether  British interests had  beenbetrayed to the United   States;  and there  would certainly  be  enoughConservatives who would sustain that view to destroy us as a political force.    But  apart from these  domestic aspects, surely it would  be most unwise to renew negotiations with Mr. Coolidge.   He  has just explained to theworld the view-point of a  New England backwoodsman.   The crudity andamateurish character  of this  utterance is likely to offer his  successor anopportunity for doing something  different.   It is very noticeable  thatMr. Hoover has let it be  known that he did not see the Coolidge speechbeforehand.  Mr. Coolidge will soon sink back into the  obscurity  fromwhich only accident extracted him.  His successor has the advantage of starting  with the American attitude to Europe at its very worst, and it  is hardly in human nature that he should not try to  strike a different note andachieve solutions beyond his predecessor^ scope.  We ought  not to make up our minds precipitately that no fair or decent  treatment can be got from       [18479]                                                   B
M^Hbovery &apos;cn ft&amp;at&apos; dtewould ihotpayj ihimsjajS rfen?American Bresidenti some-1wh&apos;at to improve the Coolidge Armistice Day position.     &quot;       -  - -  I-    -Therefore there  is  every  reason,  before plunging again  into  the dangerous waters of Disarmament, to wait for (a) our own General election and:^(^;, Mr. Hoover&apos;s installation.  Whatever British Government is in power in the summer of 1929 cannot have a worse, and may conceivably haveaYfeetter-, chance of reopening the Naval controversy.                     . Sii w Above all things  I deprecate  a panic mood in our relations with theUnited- States.  A very  sensible  article  in the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; of allp&amp;pers-i is reprinted herewith as a corrective to undue pessimism.  Afterallj-the only bad thing that has happened in Anglo-American relations is ournot being able to  agree about cutting our Navy down.  We are told that thishas wiped out all, or most  of, the effects of  such great events as the abrogationof the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the settlement of the Irish question, theWashington Treaty and  the-Anglo-American&apos;debt settlement.   If so, it only:shows how little  advantage is to be  gained by making such efforts to conciliate American opinion.  Whatever may have been  done at enormouscost- and sacrifice to keep up friendship  is apparently swept away by the.smallest little  tiff or misunderstanding,  and you have to start  again andplacate, the Americans  by  another batch of  substantial  or  even vitalconcessions.     All our present troubles are admittedly due to Geneva. Our well-meantendeavours to further the work of the Disarmament Commission have led us into an unfortunate and humiliating position both at home and abroad.  Butthis is all passing away;   The great mass  of the British public do not desireto see England  obsequious  to  the United States, and would be  deeplyanxious if it were thought the  Government were  ready to palter with our naval  security.   T  do  not  think that  the  Geneva  discussions  have cut very deep  in England, or that they will play  an important part in the^forthcoming Election.  Anyhow,  the least said,  the soonest mended.io 0 So far as America is  concerned, she is going to build her fifteen cruisers.jn.three years. Why shouldnT she ?  We  have built or are building nineteen;jat::the: present time,  and in the next three.years I suppose we  shall buildsi&apos;X or seven more.  I  cannot see how anyone could complain  of,the  United, States equipping her costly battle fleet with an adequate modern cruiser force. Theyjhave done  nothing  so  far; and nothing they have even talked about^seriously up to the present.goes beyonol the normal balance of a well equippedi tAhieracan fleet equal, in  aggressive units to our  own.  And three  or four:),yeaj?sj must pass before  they even reach, parity  in  10,000-ton. 8-inch gunS.iy.ess.els:. . ...     ..  .                         .     ..i!r.).,j-.ioObviously our policy is to sit quite  quiet,  to be independent and cool.;iahdjpolite, to let them build their fifteen ships and to build ourselves  as little-vasiwe possibly can in the interval. Deeds count much more  than words injidisarmament, The. mere slowing,down  of our programme last, year easedlithewhole rupture, of,the Geneva Conference.;If the Americans feel, they are
building a great many mote shipsdn.the:next-three yearsthan: anybody;else,and we remain quite content and do nothing hurriedly or excitedly, the 1931Conference at Washington may open under conditions far more favourable than any hitherto experienced.    I cannot see that we shall lose anything or run any great risk by jogging-along quietly on our path-which is an honourable and peaceful path-and holding firmly to our rightful Naval position  so admirably explained  bySir Austen Chamberlain at Ottawa.   In this way the  Naval question willdrop into the  background  for the time being.   America will  be buildingmuch more than anybody else, so presumably she will be&apos;happy.  We shallhave kept controversial references to the United States out of our. GeneralElection, and  the  present  ill-temper  will gradually&apos;subside.  It is . mostimportant, however, to realise  that Great Britain and her Empire are a strongforce in the world, that her day is not yet over,  that we have a right to liveas well as other countries, and that we have come, through a series of perilsand seen the end of many giants  in the past- - I.do not believe that such apolicy of wise and  deliberate  inactivity, and.even lethargy, at this juncturewill get us into any trouble,,or that the United  States will either set aboutus in berserk fury or markedly reduce the volume of her tourist traffic as mr. Craigie so variously suggests. -  -    .   &apos;         -             . -  -  -     .: -   ....,,         w.&apos; s: c.

President Coolidge, however, has seen fit to breaki this rule  in a rather astonishing fashion.  After years of sonorous silence, only punctuated now and then by the utterance of  some discreet  inanity, he has suddenly delivered a sort of dying.kick with a viciousness, of&apos;-which few people, on this side of the Atlantic, at any rate, would have supposed him capable.  His Armistice Day speech was, in effect, a denunciation of Europe and all its works&apos; from the standpoint of a 100. per cent.  New England backwoodsman. It was not a very effective speech, and to judge from certain inaccuracies and incoherences in it one might suspect that he prepared it himself without assistance from any of his  secretaries or officials-for no competent private secretary could possibly have allowed&apos;him to deliver-it without serious revision.&apos; Still, it was a hefty kick,  and to make sure that it        [18479]                                                 B 2
 should, not miss its mark the .&apos; President had copies; of 1 it distributed &apos; in advance to the European press through the American Embassies.   .  It. has been  suggested  by some  Americans  how  in  Europe that in considering this speecn allowance should be made for the fact that President Cool id go is extremely annbyed by the choice of Mr. Hoover as his successor, and.isrinclined toi do  as much damage as he can during the short period which remains,before  his retirement into private life.  But  that after all is a question of American domestic politics, with which we are hot concerned and upon which we can  form no judgment of our own.  It has also been suggested that President Coolidge, realising, after years of self-suppression :in  the interests Of his&apos;party,, that he  is how in effect a free man. decided for once  to speak  his own mind. .  That again may he  so,  but from&apos;the European point of view  what is said by the President of the UnitedStates&apos;must be taken as the voice of the people of the United States -unless it be in some, way authoritatiyely repudiated..  No doubt there are a great many Americans, who would  wish, if they could,  to repudiate both the&apos;.manner and the matter of  their Presidents speech last Sunday, but how can they do so? They must.be content to believe that sensible people over here do not seriously suppose this  raucous  bombastic harangue to be the  authentic voice of America.                                                     &apos;     To most European readers a great many of the  Presidents statements must have seemed quite unintelligible.   He  suggests, for example, that America made greater&apos;financial sacrifices in the war than any other country, that she spent &quot;half of her entire wealth  &quot; upon it and created &quot;a mighty engine for the prosecution of the war&quot; which &quot;was the greatest power that any nation on earth had ever assembled.&quot;  In face of  such wildly inaccurate statements as  these,the European reader can only take refuse in bewildered silence.  The President goes on to&apos;quote figures, and here, too. the European reader can only gasp in amazement.  America, according to her President, is now spending  100.000,000 a year on war pensions ahd&apos;&apos;allbwahces to the bereaved and  the &quot;disabled.  Our own expenditure &quot;under thesame heads  which is not calculated upon a particularly ungenerous scale-amounts to , 62,000,000 a  vear,and our casualties  were about twelve times as.numerous as /those  of  the American  army.  The total  cost to America, of  her participation  in the war is estimated bv the President at twenty thousand million pounds sterling.   One can only think that, if the President has not somehow got hold of some wrong figures, there  must have been an  almostincredible amount of extravagance or-graft in the spending departments atAyTashinpton.  The truth is, of course, that having regard to the enormous profits made by America  in supplying Europe with munitions and food and raw rnaterials at fancy prices, the war cost her a good deal less than nothing at.all!  She emerged from it richer and more prosperous than at any previousmoment in her history.... ..,&apos; , These patent absurdities, however, are not very important and we shall not, on this side of the Atlantic, take very seriously the Presidents picture
ofsthe, woefully, overburdened American taxpayer^ nor shall we, on the ptherhand,&apos; resent his having drawn it.  We ptcsuine  that &apos;he kndws hIsrioWrT;business, and if  it suits  him to talk this  kind of  nonsense it is no veryparticular concern of ours.  We may question his  taste,  but&apos;we Certainlyshall not question his right to say what he pleases.    But.what may,  perhaps, be serious and important or would be if he were not just about to retire for ever are the Presidents references -to&quot;&apos;peace and disarmament.  He suggests that in the  matter of disarmamentthe American is the  only righteous nation in the world. She has taken the&apos;lead; but, alas! other countries will&apos;not follow her.  They seek to restrict:the construction of the types of armament  which America requires, and&apos;to-leave unrestricted the typfes which they  conceive themselves  to require-.This, says the President, is &quot; significant/&apos;  Which,  of course, it is on bothsides  of the Atlantic.   He  proceeds,  however, to state the  position-ofAmerica in quite unequivocal terms. After referring to the remarkable factthat the American troops who were engaged in&apos; the War emerged from it&quot; undefeated,&quot; he.says that   &apos;    &apos;       &apos;                      I///-  Uv/i    while placing our faith in more complete understandings  which, shall    harmonise with the universal conscience, we ought,not  to forget that,    all the rights we now possess, the peace we now  enjoy, have, heen&quot;    procured for us by a long series of sacrifices and conflicts.     .During the  War,  he  continued,  the  American.  people &quot; awoke  tq;  th; drum beats of a new.destiny.&quot;  America,  he said,  did not want any mqrewar, but &quot; the first law of progress required the world to face  facts,&apos; , and every precaution should be taken.                              .    ,    ,         All human experience seems to  demonstrate that a country which    makes reasonable preparation  for defence is less likely to be subject to   \a  hostile attack and less likely to suffer a violation of its rights which    might lead to war.   This is the prevailing attitude of the United States     and one which I believe should constantly determine  its actions.--vi^rmilHere is the  doctrine  of si. vis  pacem  para beUumr-^pure, nude&apos; .andundefiled stated in a more emphatic form than any European statesinaix,even of the tremulous Succession States, has ventured to enunciate?/&apos;It Isthe specific doctrine of unmitigated competition in armaments.  Therefissomething in.it irresistibly  reminiscent of the speeches of the unluckyKaiser Wilhelm the Second.   Of course, with all its egregious jingoism,&quot;itis only nonsense, and we have nothing to be anxious about, any more thanAmerica has reason in  any conceivable circumstances to  be anxious abohtthe &quot; hostile attack &quot; which the President adumbrates.  Still, why sa&apos;y such things %  Why should the Apostle of. Peace (President  Calvin Cdolidge)offer such ammunition to the devil?  Since he is just  about to depart&apos;intothe obscurity from  which he  ought probably never to have emerged/1 aridfrom which he never would have emerged but, for an accident,  we heed  not
   say all vve might...say about this .Pecksniffian g.jafj. of \h.is.  His successor,   Mr. Hoover, even if his sentiments are as anti-British, as they are reputed   to  be, is  not  at all  likely to adopt  any similar tone.   It  is  commonly   assumed  in this country that one ought not to speak  frankly to or aboutJ-^QOUT American cousins.&quot;  But for  our part we see no object in mam-   Gaining any such insulting reticence for insulting, of  course, it is,  as the   Americans very well understand.  And,  after all, speeches like that of the   American President last Sunday (or  that of Lord Birkenhead in reply on   Wednesday last) can do no very serious harm,  because the  real relations   between  America  and  the British Commonwealth  do not  depend upon   mutual civilities.  They depend rather  upon common interests, common   institutions and common instincts, which cannot be affected by the orations   of temporary office-holders on either side of the ocean.  There is no need for   any  &quot;better   understanding.&quot;   We understand each  other quite well   enough.  Relations often get on much better together  when the form of their   mutual intercourse is not too  intimate.   Still, harking back  to the speech   of  the obsolescent President, it would probably be better if  statesmen on   both sides of the Atlantic would avoid these nationalistic imbecilities, or,   if that is asking too much, that their speeches should not be given extra-   territorial publicity.
