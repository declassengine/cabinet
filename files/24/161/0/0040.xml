Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Parliamentary          Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.  1.     As the Cabinet is aware the question of the increasing  congestion  of London traffic has assumed  an urgent aspect  and.  the Government is being pressed by all parties in the House  of Commons  and by the Press to find some  solution to the  problem.  2.      The subject has received consideration from  a number  of Commissions and Committees during the  past IS years.  The Royal Commission on London Traffic, 19(55, the Select  Committee on Motor Traffic, 1913, and the Select. Committee  on Transport  (Metropolitan Area), 1919, in their reports  all advocated the setting up of a London  Traffic Authority.  Finally in  1920 the Departmental Committee on London Traffic  under the Chairmanship of the late Mr. Kennedy-Jones, appointed  by the then Minister of Transport, recommended, the creation  of an executive authority as a permanent  statutory body  under the Minister of Transport with power to deal &quot;&quot;ith all  matters connected with London Traffic.  The objections to  this proposal were that it would, place a  considerable charge  on the Exchequer for what may be regarded as a local service,  and. would remove from the control of the  local authorities  an important section, of the work which, is included in the term  &quot;local government services&quot;.  For these reasons and  also in  view of the general financial situation,  it was decided, not &apos;to. proceed,  with this scheme at the time,  and- efforts were  made instead to obtain an unopposed Bill  of a temporary.  character.  The difficulties in obtaining an agreed, measure  proved insurmountable in 1920, and in 1921 the matter was shelved  pending the report of the Royal Commission on London Government  presided over by Lord Ullswater as it was clear that if the
Commission reported in favour of a Greater London Authority,that body would become the  required Traffic Authority.3,      Lord Ullswater&apos;s Commission has now reported and inview of their recommendations with! regard to transport,  Ihave decided not to pursue  the suggestion of a Traffic  Auth-ority with executive powers, but bo recommend instead thatcertain additional powers should be conferred upon the  Ministerof Transport over an area covering a radius of about 25 milesfrom the metropolis, and that the Minister should exercisethose powers on the advice  of a London &amp; Home Counties  TrafficAdvisory Committee composed as follows :  A Chairman appointed by the Minister of Transport,  1 Representative of the Home Office0  1       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  London County Council,,  1       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  Corporation of the City of                             London,,  1       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  Metropolitan Borough Councils0.  1       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  County Councils of Kent                            Essex, Herts, Surrey,                            Middlesex, Bucks, and                            Berks,  1       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  County Borough Councils                            within the traffic area,  1       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  Metropolitan Police,  1       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  Labour engaged in the                            transport industry in                            the traffic areas  3 members appointed by the Minister after consultation       with the interests concerned,  including          (i)  the associated Underground Railway  and                     Omnibus Undertakingso         (ii)  other railways in the traffic area,        (iii)  users of horse and mechanical road vehicles                     within the traffic area^
          The Committee would  be  unpaid  and  tho  Secretary  and   any neoessary minor  staff  would be  officials of  the  Ministry  of   Transport.   Aa. the  Committee would only consider  regulations or   other  matters referred  to  them  by the  Minister,  the  technical   and administrative work in connection  with those matters would   bo done by the  ordinary staff of the Ministry.  All this work is   either an extension  of  or  very  closely connected with work already   being  done.   4.  Po^H of  the JWjuj at or.            The powers  proposed to be  conferred upon  the Minister   are:       (1)   To oall  for half  yearly returns from  tho  Highway Author-   ities  of  their proposed programmes for tho forthcoming  six months   of street improvement a  on certain specified streets  whioh would   be the main through  routes,  and to  make Orders specifying the   times  at  whioh  each  of  these works  shall be commenced in order   to avoid  simultaneous blocking  of alternative  routes.          The major part  of the  programmes cf the  Highway  Authorities   already  some  to the  Ministry in connection with  the  classification   grant  and the engineers of the  Ministry already  make suggestions   to avoid  the  simultaneous blocking of  alternative  routes but they   have m power to  enforce their suggestions.       (2)   To  extend to all road authorities ir.  tho  area the power   already possessed by those in Middlesex of fixing  a  building line   on arterial  roads *    This power is urgently needed to prevent the   encroachment  of buildings on land which will undoubtedly be requir-I   ed for Road  enlargement in the future.  The  assistance  of the   Ministry  will be necessary in defining this line but this is   already part  of the  ordinary work of planning  arterial roads.
                                                  319                                                  C -J w   (5)  To make regulations  with regard to       (i) general control of traffic,  e.g.  prescribing             the routes  to be followed  by particular             classes  of  traffic,  the  speed  of  different             classes  of  veh.Lcles; rules as  to  precedence,             conditions  of loading and  unloading,.             delivery of goods,  collection  of  refuse,             etc.      (ii) vehicles of special descriptions, waiting,             unattended or broken-down  vehicles,  cab             ranks, hackney  carriages not hired and             not on a cab rank.     (iii) obstructions  to traffic, e.g, lighting            and guarding of  street works, erection of            works likely to  hinder the  free  circulation            of traffic,  queues,  etc.Each regulation would be laid before  Parliament assoon as it is made, and may be annulled by  His majesty in Council if an address is  presented against  it  within twenty-one days.     Other- duties, of the tAdvisory t Committee.       In addition to advising the Minister in theexercice of these new powers, It will be the duty ofthe Committee to report to him on any matter referred tothem in connection with any of his powers in relationto traffic on streets in the traffic area,  and,  inter  alia,on Private Bills affecting traffic, including  railwaysbills; schemes for new systems of transport snd  theImprovement or extension ol existing systems,  includingthe power  to surest, the allocation of expenditure falling on the highway authorities among all the authorities  inthe area.  Such a suggested allocation would have no bindingforce but  would form a basis for negotiation in the  caseof larger  schemes requiring special legislation.
It is not anticipated that in the case of minor schemes which could be done without special statutory powers,contributions will be required from the whole area.6.   Conditions on Ljconcss for.Stage.Carriages.      It may be that- in or-dsr to cope with London Trafficwith full effect there should be a power to limit thenumber of omnibuses on the streets.  To take such a power atthe moment would be to confirm definitely the monopoly ofthe London General Omnibus Company and would entail obviouspolitical difficulties.   After discussion with the police authorities it is considered that the necessary alleviationcan be obtained by.conferring on the licensing authoritiesin the area, i0e* the Metropolitan Police, the county boroughs and other authorities having licensing powers inthat part of the area not covered by the MetropolitanPolice, a power to &quot;define routes&quot; both as regards their course and terminal points.  A condition would thenbe attached to licences that omnibuses must run only onthese defined routes  (or such of them as are suitable forthe type of vehicle) and if necessary further conditionsmay be the maintenance of a regular service and the observance of  a time-table *   By those means it isanticipated that undue crowding of particularly profitablecentral  streets would  in fact be avoided, and there wouldbe free  competition  on equal terms.       It  ii  proposed that  the existing licensing authorities  should carry  oat this  work subject to appealto the Minister who  would  refer the matter to the AdvisoryCommitteeo
         At  present  licensing authorities,  other than theMetropolitan Police, may refuse licences and an appeal lies tothe Minister under Section 14 (3)  of the Roads Act against anysuch refusal.   There is no legal  power to  attach conditions,apart from the fitness of vehicles, to licences, though inpractice the power of refusal enables conditions to be imposed.The new proposal is to confer on authorities in the trafficarea a definite power to impose conditions  and to give to theMetropolitan Police a similar power though  not a power ofrefusal.   It will be seen that the administrative work inconnection with this pr-uposal would, fall on the licensing authorities as at present, and the duty of  the Minister andthe Committee would he confined to the hearing of appeals.7.   Expenses.        As previously explained many of the duties in connectionwith the new powers are complementary to tho ordinary dutiesof the Roads Department.   Speoial powers for making regulations for the London streets are required in the interests of road, andparticularly mechanically-propelled, traffic, and tho specialcircumstances  in London, being the Capital and having manyhighway authorities who are not either the police authorities or the licensing authorities, justifies a differentiation between London and the rest of the country.  ; The conditionsare  so  special that I  do not think the establishment of thiscommittee could result in  valid demands for similar treatmentby other  areas.   I  suggest that the expenses  of the Committeeincluding the  additional staff required by the Ministry ofTranoport should be made a charge  en the Road Fund    I do notthink that  this expenditure should exceed in the first instance 10,000 a year, but  it must be recognised that  the satisfactory solution of  the problem  of London traffic Must  involve technical

A soheme  on theae  lines  has been discussed with mostof the important  interests  concerned, and. a certain measureof agreement  has  been reached.    With the permission of thePrime Minister I  announced in the House that I-hoped to beable to make  a statement before the recess.   I should be gladtherefore of  the  approval of  the  Home Affairs Committee to theintroduction  of a Bill on these lines, and of their authorityto state in the House that  it will be introduced in the autumn session.              n                    (Initialled)    W.A.
