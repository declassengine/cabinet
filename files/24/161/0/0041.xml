       Mempranduiri by the minister^ of Health.           In Paragraph 12(1) of my Memorandum CP.266(23)on the question of an Exchequer Grant for Necessitous AreasI stated my view that &quot;no block grant from the Exchequer shouldbe given in respect of the exceptional bur-dens caused byunemployment although assistance to Boards of Guardians shouldbe continued en the lines hitherto followed, talcing the risk that in certain cases it may not be possible to obtain repay-ment of loans to them&quot;.           Since this Memorandum was written, at the instanceof the Chairman of Ways and Means and Sir Samuel Roberts, Ihave seen a representative  deputation from Sheffield whodeveloped with considerable cogency the arguments for exceptional treatment of their area, on the ground that whilethe rate burden in the district  was maintained at its present level it would be next to impossible for the local industries to recover their foreign markets.   It was, for instance,pointed out that according to an analysis made by Messrs,Vickers, the cost per ton of steel, after allowing forincreased rateable value and reduced production,  included 1.14.5. attributable to rates in the two half-years ended30th September 1922 against 4s. in the two half-years ended31st March, 1913.   Similar evidence from other firms hadbeen put. before an Inspector of my Department last winter,when he was conducting an Inquiry into Poor Law administration
at Sheffield.   Incidentally I may remark here that this inquiry indicated that the high expenditure on relief wasnot due to maladminlstration or unjustifiable laxity onthe part of the Sheffield Board of Guardians in administeringrelief.   I quote the Sheffield case because it is a goodinstance of the case of the necessitous areas which theGovernment have to meet from all parts of the House and not least from ouC own supporters from the industrial areas.           The demand for special assistance has been growing in intensity and I do not think it will be possiblefor the House to adjourn without the Government making some further positive statement of policy to deal with this difficult situation.   Accordingly, I -have&quot;&apos; put forward thefollowing proposal for assistance &quot;along the line of policyalready suggested namely of loans administered by theGos^chen Committee:- - it will be remembered that at presentthe main title to a Gos^chenloan is that the Guardianscannot themselves raise money except on prohibitive terms -  (a)  Individual cases to be considered on their merits      and save in very exceptional circumstances loan      assistance not to be given in the case of any Union      in which the rate in the   for all purposes in any      part of the Union is equivalent to a rate for a year      of not more than 17s.6d. and the expenditure on the      relief of the poor, Including loan charges properly      payable on loans already raised for current expenses,      Is equivalent to not more than a rate of  4s.6d. for      a year,  (b)  In my case in which there is prima facie ground for      assistance under (a) the Guardians would be required      to consider with the municipal authorities on whom      they precept for the poor rate, what maximum rate
                                                 BIG     can reasonably be  levied, for the relief of the  poor,     having regard to the total rate burden in the area     and other local circumstances.(c)   If the Ministry of Health is satisfied that the     proposed rate Is reasonable, as close a budget  as      possible would be required to  be drawn for the     ensuing half-year on the basis  of the proceeds  of  the     rate suggested and the estimated expenditure, after     allowing for all possible economies.(d)   If this budget shows an estimated deficit the Ministry     of Health would then sanction a loan for 5, 7 or 10     years, as the circumstances required, for a round  sum     approximately equivalent to the estimated deficit  and     the Goslchan Committee would make advances as required     during the half-year.  (It is,  of course, Important     that the loan should be fixed in amount before  the     expenditure is Incurred).(e)  .The question of terms as to payment of Interest and     repayment of loan would be considered in each case, the     most favourable normally being  postponement of  payment     of Interest and repayment of instalments of principal     for three years from the date of the  advance, though In     some very special cases total remission may have to be     allowed.   The Guardians and local authority in an area     where a loan is conceded would  be informed that at the     end of the period of postponement, the Ministry will      review the then existing situation In consultation     with them and decide what is fair and reasonable;               The above proposal is a rough and ready  way of     relieving the immediate rate burden in the hardest hit     localities,   I do not think that a strictly scientific
     basis is at present attainable.   The time for this will     come when the question arises hew far the loans are to     be remitted.   By that time I hope that the new Valuation     and Rating proposals will be in operation since without     them it is impossible to judge what the real financial     burdens of the localities may be.          The above proposals are, it will be seen, simplyan extension of the arrangements which have sufficed duringthe last two difficult years.   Since the local authority will have to bear in mind the contingency of repayment,they will have an inoentlve to economy, the absence of whichis so cogent an argument against any system of free grants in aid of poor law relief expenditure,  It is probable alsothat no free grant which could be contemplated in present financial circumstances would afford as much assistance as can be given under these proposals or go so far in Immediatelyrelieving the rate burden on industries.          I estimate that the total cost of the scheme inthe current half-year on the basis I have outlined shouldnot exceed  i.,000,000 for England and Wales,   In succeedinghalf-years this amount will vary as conditions get betteror worse, and I cannot, of course, judge when tho arrangementcan be brought to an end.          I ask for Cabinet sanction(1) to the principle of the above scheme(3) to /my making a general statement on the subject    including the proposals for the temporary remission of    loan charges but without specifying the maximum period    of three years which I have in mind in this connection.    I should not, of course;. at present refer to any                          - 4 -
