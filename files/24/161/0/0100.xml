The unemployed are comparatively quiescent at present,but rumours of activity during the winter are increasing.     Tha Moscow &quot;International Propaganda Committee,of office and Clerical Workers, which is holding a conferencein December, has asked for full information regardingGovernment employees in Great Britain.

activities of the British Communist Party in thisconnection has  come into my possession,  the  text ofwhichis as follows:          &quot;The  presidium of the  communist International     is proposing some time early next year  to oonvene     en International negro conference.          &quot;In connection with suoh a conference and as     a preliminary  to securing negro representatives   ,  from Great Britain it will  be neoessary for the     Central Committee of the British party  to prepare     and Issue  leaflets for distribution in  such     cosmopolitan centres as London, Glasgow, Liverpool,     Manchester and Cardiff and  our Intention is to     follow up  the distribution  of leaflets  with  .     meetings amongst negroes ?/ho are seamen.          &quot;We shall be glad to have the assistance of     the District Party Committee in the centres mentioned     above in the task of preparing suitable and     effeotive  leaflets.   To this &quot;end we shall be glad     if your District Party Committee will immediately     appoint someone to make the neoessary enquiries     and send us a report with all possible  data, on     the numbers of the negro population in  your district,     the nature anfl conditions of their employment, wages,     hours, etc.          &quot;Any  useful recommendations or suggestions     you.are able to offer on this question  will also     be appreciated.&quot;     Distriot Party Committees and Unattached Looalshave been infonned by headquarters that:          &quot;The  November Municipal and Local  Elections     will soon  be on and it is expected that all CP.     Locals will do their utmost to push forward the     general policy of the Party and place before the ,     largest possible sections of the workers the case     for communism.          &quot;We have to remind you of our decision that     all Looals when promoting Municipal or  Local&quot; .     Government Candidates, are urged to submit for the     approval of the Political Bureau,  draft election     addresses  Incorporating the important questions     of locfl/ interest,  or alternatively to  submit for     approval the points that call for special attention.&quot;     Although the communists,  as such,  made praotioallyno impression upon the recent meeting of the TradesUnion Congress at Plymouth they were in some measureresponsible for the many disoordant episodes whioh wereauoh a marked feature of the proceedings.Plymouth;/
    Plymouth:  the Chief Constable//Ifanas me that the    attendance at the various outdoor meetings ranged from    70 to 500.   Among the visiting speakers were Harry    Pollitt, Ellen Wilkinson, Tom  Clark, Helen Crawfurd and    J.J. Jagger:  the last named who is president of the    Distributive and Allied Workers1 Union stated in a    speech made at the back of the Market Place on September    3rd that he had received a complaint from the Plymouth    branoh-of the Union, objecting to his name being used    by the Plymouth Communist Party:  he would like to inform    them&apos;that,  as long as he did his duty to the union it    r,?as no business of theirs what politics he chose to    adopt.   Ho was.a communist and was always to be found    et the extreme left of the extreme left.   It had been    stated at the Congress that if labour got into power,    they would  only  be able slightly to modify the present    capitalist system:  he was out for its total abolition:    he  was out to root it up root and branch and by force    of arms if necessary.THE RED nJTBRNATIOMI OF LABOUR UEIONS         An  informal  meeting of the British Bureau was held    in  London on  August  27th at which Gallacher,  Homer,    Watkins,  J.R.  Campbell,  Adams,  F.  Smith ana  T.  and F..    Queloh were present.    It was  decided  to ask  EHas of    Cardiff  to  act as  seoretary supervising  the  general worts    of  the Red  International of Labour Unions in  South    Wales  as  Thomas had  enough to  do  with  work  emong  the    miners.   A proposal  that J.  Ouinton should undertake    propaganda work emong  the dockers  was  referred  to    Gallacher to make  the necessary arrangements.   This                                            meeting/
meeting was followed by another on August 31st in whichGallacher, Mann, Adsms, - F, Smith and T. and. F. Quelchtook part.   It was decided in connection with theSnglish^Irish edition of the Red International of LabourUnions&apos; bulletin, which Tom Quelch is editing, thatSmith should do the engineering section, Noah Ablottthe mining section and Jack Carney the Irish Trade union movement.   It was agreed that, as the publication of&quot;The law Charter&quot; had been suspended a list of the agents should be procured and sent to the editor of&quot;The Worker&quot; in order that news of the unemployed shouldbe given publicity in that paper until tha NationalUnemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement was in a betterfinancial position *   Tom Quelch was appointed Bureaudelegate to the Central Executive Committee of theCommunist Party and to the annual meeting of the labour-Research Department.     The British Bureau has decided to pay particular attention to the textile unions and the LancashireDivisional Organiser of the Communist Party is assistingin the attempt to set up a series of &quot;good committees in the reactionary cotton trade unions.&quot;     The Moscow International Propaganda Committee ofTransport Workers complains,that it has not yet establishedcontact with transport workers in Great Britain and has instructed the British Bureau of the Red Internationalof labour Unions to take  steps to remedy this defect.     The Central European Bureau of the Red Internationalof Labour Unions has instructed &quot;revolutionary minorities                                               of/
 of  leather  Workers&quot;  In  Great  Britain  ana  other  countries to  conduct  &quot;an  intensive  and  energetic  campaign in favqur  of the admission of  the  All-Russlan  Leather Workers&apos; Federation  to  the  Leather Workers&apos;  International&quot; whioh is to  hold  a congress in  Dresden  on September 16th when formal application for admission will  again be made by the  Russian  Federation.     &quot;The International Propaganda Committee  of Revolutionary Miners&quot;,  in announcing  to the  British Bureau  the  issue  of  Mo. 8 of  &quot;The Red Miner&quot; admonishes that body for its failure to  supply articles  end information  concerning  British  miners.     The above-mentioned  issue  of &quot;The  Red Miner&quot; contains a mass  of propaganda material and information concerningminers1 trade unions in various parts of  the  world: only a  few paragraphs refer specifically  to  this oountry: they deal with  the annual conference  of the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain and the movement  in SouthWales for affiliation to  the Red International  of LabourUnions.   A. Horner who attended the  recent Moscow conference is the author  of a short article on  the latter  question.     There is little surface activity among  the organisedunemployed at present:  this state of affairs is due, in part, as  far as London is concerned  to the formation of a rival organisation to  the national UnemployedWorkers1 Committee Movement.     A meeting held in Trafalgar Square on September^9thwas attended only by about  100 people:  the speeches                                           were/
     were dull end no resolutions were put before the     meeting.          Hannington is addressing London meetings on the     subject of his visit to Russia and is attracting fair     sized audiences.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY -AOS Iff IF IBS IN GRMT BRITAIN          As far as tho open Republican Movement is concerned     matters here  are practically at a standstill, awaiting     the  result of a Convention to be held shortly in Lublin.          The  new  Irish Republican League is  still functioning,     but  its leaders are men of very little importance,  and     some of them  are of very doubtful character.   They have     extended  their meetings to.the suburban  areas - Eeekfcam     Rye,  Brockwe11 Park and Clapham Common - where their &apos;     speakers,  who are a poor lot,  encounter  a good deal of     opposition and  ara  subjected to severe hackling.          The  secret,  or Irish Republican Army si5s of the     movement  is showing signs of renewed activity,   A new     &quot;0/C Britain&quot; hes been appointed in the  person of William     Ahem,  formerly  &quot;O/G London&quot;;   his  name  was  included in     the  list  for  Deporsticn in March last, but he escaped     the  net-.   - The  numerous disagreements among  the Irish     Republican Army  leaders in Scotland have resumed,  it is     said,  in  the  appointment, of  an entirely  new Brigade Staff.          Jim  Larkin  appears to have cut himself  off definitely     from the  Irish  arc  Transport and General Workers&apos; Union,     of which he was  the founder  and general  secretary,  and     has  established  en  Irish Workers1 League in  which-he     hopes  to  include  every  Irish worker,  not only in  Ireland,                                                  but/
but throughout the world:  organising centres  are  to beestablished in Ireland, England.  Scotland  and  Wales, theUnited States, South Africa and Australia.
