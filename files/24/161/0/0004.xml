304 (2S)     The Relations of the Army and the Royal Air Force.        Memorandum by Sir Laming Worthington-Evans. .        I call the attention of the Cabinet to a paper 159 -0    which I circulated on 4th February 1922 wlicn I was Secretary    of^State .f or: War.   For the reasons there stated I agree, with    Lord Derby&apos;s memorandum CP. 296 (25)  in which he expresses    Jqis dissent from the findings of the National and Imperial &apos;;    Defence Sub Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence    (CP. 899 (23))...   X only received ny copy of the decision,.on    the 2nd of July...  No reasons are given for the decision and I    have-not had time to ascertain them.   I beg that the following    observations may be considered.        -The rapid developments vrtiich have taken place in the air    have transformed the air arm from a reoonnaisance corps into a    general fighting force approximating more and more to the    functions of an Army,   Air Transport, air projectiles botlv    by bombs and guns small and large and air observation, are    factors which are probably destined to transform the    composition of. the fighting forces in the near future.   It may    be that the Army as - we now know it will be largely superseded    and replaced.by a Force conducting its operations for,the main    part in the air.   But it is going too far.to argue that the    decisive plans will be the air alone.    However oomplete a    mastery may be attained in the air it is on the surface of    the earth that the fruits will be reaped,                                                          &apos;  Victory                                               /j/Ji frlAODOCDMEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF ESS BRITANNIC MAJESTY; S GOWJIMRffT.                        0 A B I- H E T.R E T.
 Victory will fall to the side which moat completely unifies control and uae of all the instruxoents &quot;by which it imposes its will upon the enamy,     The object should not be to develop the Air Force so that at some time it may be possible to do  Without an army,  but so to graft aerial progress upon the existing land forces  that all the new factors which the new arm bring3 into play  can be tactically used in the most effective  and economical manner,     Duplication i3 inevitable if separate organisations are maintained to  perform what are becoming more and more closely allied  services,   The Air Force to secure an independent existence  will be  compelled involuntarily and increasingly to overlap tlie( other  forces  in Intelligence, Recruiting, Disciplinej  Medical  services,  Transport and Supply,  Contract, Chaplainsf Guard duties, Anti-aircraft  defence,  Signals  etc. Already l  million pounds  a year  is wasted  on duplication  of administrative  services.     The wastefulness  of the duplioate system is  also  evident in the  question of personnel,   Instead  of training and using the young men who will continue to be attracted  by the tradition and prestige of the Army for  whatever  cay prcve to be the most  efficient form  of fighting, another  set of young men not necessarily nor even probably of as good material willhave to be enrolled for the Air while those joining the Arraywill suffer by having their careers out short by the constant cramping3 Imposed on. the land forces by the growth of the AirForce,    Moreover, the flying life of Airmen  is limited.  At onetime it was said to average five years.  And though it is now claimed to be longer it is admitted to be considerably shorterthan the-active lifa of a soldier,                                                          The
c                                                                45             The consequence of a comparatively short Flying life  will         be  either that no career can he offered to  an Airman in his         service or that appointments are created for Airmen on the         ground  with a tendency to incraasa unnecessarily  the  ground         appointments.  Either  oonsequenoe leads to  extravagant expense *             The appointments other than the relatively few  general  staff         and  command appointments  are administrative  appointments for         whioh an Airman lias no greater  capacity than a Soldier.             The Soldiers and the  Airmen will always  have  to oo-operate         and  it  must he  a great advantage  to eaoh that  each should know         the  capabilities and limitations  of the  other.            All these considerations point to there  being one  service,        not two, one  service in&apos;which.the junior officers,-or  such        number  as may be  necessary-.,&quot; after a short time with their        regiments or Corps join or are attached to &amp;n Air Unit with the        intention some of remaining  as flying officers all their flying        lives and others  remaining for shorter terms, and afterwards        returning to their-Corps or  regiments.            It  is useless to attempt to forecast in detail how many        officers would serve: in or within the Air Units-beoav.se the full        use of  combined work of Artillery, Infanory and Airmen has not        yet been worked, out, - To may possibly be &apos;that some Infantry        units will have air. transport &quot;and air fighters - and -chat these        again will be associated with Tanks  capable of quick movement  on        the road and slower movement across  country.  It seems to  me        oertaln however that the best tactical use of all these foross        will be worked out &quot;by one general staff with experimental  units        at its sole control.            Against these considerations it  will no doubt  be argued thati       the allocation of the Air arm between the Army and the Havy will        inevitably be productive of iapexfeot  oo-ordination between        military and naval air&quot;forces.  No theoretioal arrangement  can                                                            completely
 completely overcome  this  difficulty.   But the reply is that it is easier to co-ordinate  two  services than three.  The ohief point at. which  oo^crdinativh-,.would be needed in such a case would be&apos;-in;the- supply of  material  in a large-scale war.  And,the solution;bfi this through  the  medium of a Department of civil Aviation closely in  touch,wi-ch.the iaanufaotui-ets1 does not seem impossible- of attainment.^.. Operations on land and. on,sea must always&quot; remain largely, different  in, character.  The realms are contiguous: butnot- coincident, .  It. seems, a false analog;&apos;  that seeks- to- perpetuate,...a third realm of  quasi -independent action where the ^spheres- of., action ,d.o,in fact  coincide, and only  differ in dimension,              -       . ,   ,  .... ........
