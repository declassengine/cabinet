There are indications that the oommuniets intend to  , aevote even more attention than hitherto to propaganda inside the trade unions:  they are also working energetically to  &apos; secure individual membership of the labour Party.

     !Che  issue  of the &quot;International Prees Correspondence&quot;for July  12th is devoted entirely to reports of thesessions  of the Enlarged Executive of the Comintern heldin Moscow from June  18th to June  End inclusive:  themore  important  discussions, in so far as this country isconoerned, dealt with the work of communists in tradeunions:   this subject has been covered in some detail in recent reports, but certain extracts from the latest reports are not without interest:               &quot;Heport of Comrade lozovsky on the                      frirdiT ^^Qi&amp;gtIon*-&quot;&quot;          &quot;,.* Our Parties and Trade unions have done too     little for the  Trade unions Movement in the Colonies.     While the  British Trade  Unions and the Labour party     are  cleverly instituting themselves into India in     order to govern, our British Comnrunist party is     doing nothing of the kind.   It is however certain     that we shall not be victorious before having to     appeal to  the activity and the initiative of the     British workers.. 4          &quot;The  speaker went on to point out how great     was  the mistake of those who wished to wind up the     Red  International of Labour Unions.  The successes     achieTed by the R.I.L.U. are incontestable.  He     criticised the  attitude  of the British Communist     Party on the Trade Union question.  1% is paying too     little attention to the  question and is not assisting     the  work of the British  Bureau of tha K.I.L.U....               &quot;Discussion on the^jprade Union Question                      S&amp;il^Q.fe   (QreaFhritc/iri j -          &quot;Said that judging  by Comrade LoMOvsky&apos;!? speech,     great changes would he taking place sin the     International Trade Union movement in the near future.          &quot;The  day of the Amsterdam International is over.     It depended upon a contented working class and it     was  more conoerned with  what it should not do than with     what it should  do*  3uu  evsn in Britain, where the     trade unions have a tradition of compromise and. where     the  leaders endeavoured  -eo suppress even references     to the class war, there  was elowJy growing amongst     the  masses a de sire for  international action..  What     was  wanted was  that concrete demands should be put     before the-working class to attract their attention     to the international working class movement0
          &quot;Losovaky&apos;E review of the situation in Britain     was incorrect.  The Party did not claim that it     should he entrusted with all the work in the trade     unions, hut that it should control all the work that     was being cone in the trade unions either hy the     E.I.L.U. Bureau, or similar bodies.  An understanding     on this matter had been reached between the R. I.L.U&quot;.     Bureau and the Party.  A Conmunist nucleus in a     trade union branch would be required to secure     members for the Party, but as part of a larger trade     union formation, it would carry on the work of the     Bureau and attempt to bring over masses of the workers     to the Profintern.  The opinion that the Party was to     confine itself to political work only was an     absurdity.          &quot;He also denied that the change of the name of     the Party orgsn from  &quot;The Communist&apos; to the &quot;Workers&apos;     Weekly&apos; was an attempt to cut across the work of the     Bureau.  The change corresponded with, a change in the     organisation of the party.  They wanted the Party to     be a Party of the masses and the paper to be a paper .     of the masses.&quot;                   &quot;Cpncluding speeoh of Comrade                              Xosovslcy&apos;          &quot;...In Great Britain the work in the Trade Unions     must be energetically furthered,  end this will     strengthen the Party.  It would be foolish to wait     for the Party to become strong before making a     beginning with this urgent task...&quot;     According to the issue of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; forAugust Uth Labour Party of fioials are attempting to exclude individual communists from membership:,   thepaper quotes a letter written by the national secretaryof the labour Party to the South West Bethnal Green(Divisional) labour Party whioh was some time ago refusedaffiliation to the national body because it  numberedcommunists among Its members:  in the pour.ee of this letter the National Secretary wrote:          &quot;Your reference to the proceedings of the     last annual conference does not affect  the  question     at issue.  The deletion of clause &quot;B1 from the     new rule, only refers to the delegates  from affiliated&apos;     branches.  The National Executive- have  re-affirmed     their decision that in view of the conference     decision for three years in succession that the     Communist Party and its branches are not eligible     for affiliation to the labour Party either nationally     or locally, therefore members of the Communist     Party are not entitled to become  individual members     of the Labour Party...&quot;In/
                        . a -     In West London also there appears to be frictionon th9 same question and the communists threaten to contest&apos;every Borough and Guardians&apos; election unless they are granted affiliation.     On August  5th and 26th a special Party council ofthe Communist Party of Great Britain is to he held inLondon to consider the proceedings at the recent EnlargedExecutive meeting of the Comintern:  provincial membersof the Council have been instructed to make a special efforitto attend.     Arrangements have been made to hold a Scottish DistrictConference on September 1st:  a new Distriot Party Committeeis to be elected and the agenda proposed by the organiserhas been enlarged by Inkpin to cover discussion of the united front ana the Labour Party.     The first of a series of &quot;Handbooks for Party Members&quot;has been issued by the Communist party of Great Britain:  itdeals with organisation and is an abridgement of the PartyCommission&apos;s Report adopted at the Battersea Conference inOctober 1922:  the object of the Handbook is to &quot;quicken the pace&quot; at which the Party is being reconstructed.     The Southward Press printed 45,000 copies of &quot;TheWorkers&apos; Weekly&quot; for July 21st:   the bill for these and  forincidental charges amounted to  101.3.0.   In view of thisprinters account it is not without interest to note that theNational Organising  Secretary informed DistributionCommittees on July 31st that the circulation of the paper had dropped from 50,000 copies weekly at the end of May to47,000:   the officials still aim at a circulation of100,000 as a stepping stone to a daily issue.

     Owing to the embargo imposed upon the entry into thisoountry of the &quot;International press Correspondence&quot;1 theExecutive of the Communist Party has decided to cancel theproposals made for developing a circulation (vide Report Ho.216.)

The &quot;international propaganda Committee of TransportWorkers&quot; has issued a manifesto to all port Bureaux,  whiohseems sufficiently important to bear quotation:          &quot;The. Third Session of the central Council  of  the     Bed International of labour Unions devoted special     attention to  the Port Bureaux, and adopted a resolution     on this question.  The  resolution puts before  the     Port Bureaux  not only agitational and propagandist     tasks,  but also tasks of &amp;n organisational character.     The Port Bureaux should actively participate in all     the conflicts arising on foreign vessels and give     striking seamen all possible moral and material aid.          &quot;Part of the organisational work consists  of  the     collection and study of data on the situation of the.     seamen in the various countries;  sufficient attention     should be given to this olause of the resolution on     the Port Bureaux.          &quot;Heretofore the compilation of suoh data and  the     exchange of information by our port Bureaux has been     entirely unsatisfactory.          &quot;The organisational work of the Port Bureaux     should, bo handled chiefly by representatives from     seamen&apos;a Unions of the  different countries who  are in     the particular port for the purpose of talcing care     of the needs  and interests of the seamen of their     oountries and unions.          &quot;The Port Bureaux should rally these     representatives about itself as a centre, give  them     all possible  support and assistance, oo-ordinate their     work, and, with their co-operation,  extend their     activities in the interests of the seamen employed     on foreign vessels.          &quot;In this way the Port Bureaux will penetrate  the     very heart of the organisational work, and will     gradually supplant this extensive institution of trade     union representatives from various coxyftries and     unions of seamen active in the particular ports.          &quot;The port Bureaux should formulate a concrete plan     of agitation  and propaganda for a definite period.     luring this period,  a certain number of addresses     should  be made on topics of the. international trade     union movement and  of the International federation     of Seamen* The great mass of seamen should be  drawn     into these lectures and disousslons.  It  is also     necessary to  give sufficient attention to the various     questions of  the national seamen&apos;s organisations     of the various countries.          &quot;The periodical press of the local seamen&apos;s     unions should establish,  under the direction of  the     Port Bureaux  an international section portraying the                                                 life/
     life  and union  activities  of  the  seamen  of  various     countries*  Where no  looal organs arc  published,  the     Port  Bureau should publish its own periodical     Informational bulletin.          &quot;It is also necessary to arouse  the interest of     the great masses of workers by popularising the work     and tasks of  the Port Bureaux in  the  labour press.&quot;     George  Hardy  has sent to  &quot;Tho Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; fromHamburg a  resolution demanding  a United Front ofTransport  Workers  against  War  and  Fascism  passed by anInternational Mass meeting of  seamen held  in  Hamburg  onJuly 87th.   Hardy states  that:          &quot;This  Mass Meeting was held  for  the purpose     of considering  the creation of the United Front  of     all Transport Workers and  especially  seamen against     war arid fascism.  The meeting was addressed by     speakers from England, America, Russia and  officials     of the  German Seamsn&apos;s Unionc  It was pointed  out thqt     the increasing  aotivity  of the fascist organisations     taking  to themselves  various  names in different     countries were  becoming a  constant menace to the  Trade     Union movement. Also the  struggle of the various  1&apos;$&apos;:     economic groups of the capitalists for control over     the exploitation of the world&apos;e resources and  its     working class brings  war  closer every month that     passes..  The occupation  of, the Ruhr  was dealt with and     the meeting expressed its dissatisfaction with the     imperial istons  policy and  the military attacks of     France  against  the workers in the Ruhr and  Rheinland.          &quot;The British policy  shows increasing animosity     between France  and England and the French determination     in reference  to the occupation of the Ruhr is  not only     harmful to  the  workers of the Ruhr and Germany as a     whole but is  a  world  menace.   It  was  also pointed     out that war  will  surely  come if  the  present     circumstances continue.   Therefore we  should prepare     for an  international  strike of seamen against  war by     preparing for the United  Front and send  the&apos;resolution     to the  various  international  organisations  which, we     hope, will  bring international solidarity and  the end     of the  war  and  the capitalist system.&quot;   &apos;  The Moscow lixecutive of the Rod International of LabourUnions has informed all national sections that aninternational conference of Land and Forest workers will  beheld  in Mosoow on September 25th to deal with &quot;the struggle against Fascism,  the question of wages in the economicstruggle,  social  insurance against  unemployment,  question of organisation/
organisations&quot;,   Invitations to attend this conferencehave been sent.to &quot;the Trade Union of Agricultural workerBof Ireland, to the Revolutionary minority of the same lfaion,*to the Trade Union of Agricultural workers of Scotland end to the Revolutionary minority of the National Union ofAgricultural workers (London)&quot;.     $he Third Session of the Central Council of the RedInternational of Labour Unions passed a resolutionregarding          &quot;Speoial attention to the question of     organising the land and forest workers.  All these     elements must be drawn into the class organisations.&quot;     In consequence of the above resolution nationalsections have been informed that;          &quot;The Essoutive Bureau of the R.I.L.U. calls     upon all its affiliated organisations to give support     and assistance to the existing organisations of the     agricultural workers, for which purpose,  considering     the laok of organisers among the agricultural workers     of many countries, the R.I.L.U. organisations are     urged to assign competent men for the organisation     of the agricultural workers, for the recruiting of     membership and winning over of the independent unionB.     The prejudices prevailing in many countries, that the     worker of one induetry cannot organise other     industries, especially the agricultural Industry,     must be discarded.   Industrial workers,  being the     best organised, should assign active workers for the     organisation of their backward class,comrades.          &quot;Special attention should be given to the     soattered masses of agricultural workers and  wide     agitation in favour of Joining the trade.unions should     be carried on among them.&quot;     The Mid-European Bureau has decided to publishspecial issues of the &quot;Red Labour Union Bulletin&quot; for eachoountry and has instructed the British Bureau to undertake the editorship of a special number dealing with Krigland andIreland;   the manuscript must reach Berlin on September 1st),will be translated there into German and the type retained for*epublloation, with numbers, dealing with other countries,In book form.
     Bea Griffiths has informed  the British Bureau of  theRod International of labour Unions that the AmalgamatedUnion of Mining Staffs and  Officials wishes to  get into touch with the Russian and  Bulgarian Clerloal and TechnicalEmployees&apos; Unions with a view to the formation  of aninternational organisation &quot;either within or alongside theRed International of Labour Unions&quot;.     W. Gallaoher has sent the following Interestingcomments on propaganda by literature among the  BritishWorking classes to the Mid  European Bureau of the RedInternational of Labour Unions:          &quot;The British Workers,  as you no doubt know,  are     very insular in&apos;their outlooko  what happens on the     Continent of Europe, or even in the British Colonies,     or even in Ireland, interests them but little.  They     have few interests outside their jobs and  wages,  they     do not consciously concern themselves with     International questions or even important  national     questions.  They are badly educated, receiving but     meagre bourgeois education in State elementary schools,     and are mentally poisoned, throughout their lives  by     cheap capitalist literature and the capitalist press.     Any literature which consists of articles  concerning     International problems of a heavy or studious type can     make no broad appeal to the masses.  Even  if suoh     Bulletins were given away the British workers,  in the     vast majority of cases, would not read them.  It  is only     a very small number, which, by dint of hard propaganda,     we have been able to interest in our work  and our     movement tlrnt would interest themselves in the  Bulletinso          &quot;If large quantities were printed they would     simply be so much waste paper, and time, end money and     material would have been wasted which oould have  been     put to much better use.          &quot;The best and most popular method of  propaganda     by literature in this oountry is the wide  circulation     of small, very simply written and profusely     illustrated pamphlets, dealing with intimate problems     of British working life.  The only way to  got     international questions thought or talked  about at all     by the broad masses here is to begin on this basis.          &quot;We well realise the decisive importance Of  ihe     English movement, and  we well realise how  important     it is to develop an international consciousness in the     British workers-but we are only too well aware  of our difficulties/

If only comrades from the Continentcould come to this country and absorb the melieu inwhich the British workers live we feel sure they wouldhe of our opinion.I&apos;.     &quot;This matter was submitted before the Party and both the Party and the Bureau are of this opinion.&quot; to be: T73EMPLOIBX)         The following memorandum has been drawn up by the     British Bureau of the iced International of labour Unions     and the Hational Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement:         &quot;(1)   The fullest co-operation to exist between                the two organisations.

An. appeal for clothing     for the &quot;boys on the Hill&quot;, of vhom there appear to be     Btill quite a considerable  number, has also  been received.          A new Irish Republican group has been started in     London under the title of the &quot;London Irish  League.&quot;    Its     founder is a young man named  John Douglas Wilkinson     (isfoich he has transformed into &quot;Eoin Dubhglas MaoUilliam);     his connection with Ireland appears to be rather remote     but he has a small following  of enthusiastic  young men and     women of the junior olork and servant girl type:  so far     they have no Houdquarters but meet two or three  times a                                                           Week/

This new league appears to bo of little or no importance but its movements will be watched.     5fco new Irish Democratic league (T*P. 0*Connor&apos;cmovement) is progressing slowly but surely:  it hasspread to the Glasgow area where its most ardentsupporter is Mr. Rooslya Mitchell, the solicitor acting for the Deportees:  he addressed a meeting of the TownheadBranch on August 5th.     On the Tynsside the annual Irish Bally slumped verybadly owing, it is said, to a feeling of disgust created by the mad folly of the extremists.  It is practically impossible just now to get together a representative Irishgathering in that area.

No gates are picketed.          Tho following incident is worth recording  as showing     the interest taken in the strike by the soviet  Government.     At 1.30 p.m0 10th inst., a  telephone message was     received by  the warehousekeeper, South wast  India Look,     from  arcos Co., (All Russian co-operative society)  soviet     House,  Moorgate Street,  that they objected to their cargo,     whioh had been sent to  YrfeBt Incia Look for  conveyance to     Batoum. being shipped on the S.S. &quot;Maid of Hydra&quot; by other     than  ordinary dook labour.   It had been on the  9th  and     10th  instant shipped by the Officers,  crew and  olerks     from  the City Office of the shipping Co., but at  about     2el5  p*m. a  wall  dressed Russian, who  represented himself     as from the  Arcos Company went on board and  said  the whole     of the  Arcos oargo,  about 100 tons, already  shipped  would     have  to be taken out again;  this the  Marine  Superintend or     deolined to  do  without instructions from his  firm and he     left  dock with the man for  the City offioe about  3 p.m.     Subsequently instructions were received by the  Captain     from  the City Offioe that no more oargo was  to  be  shipped     at present.      On August 15th the loading of the arcos     oargo into the BoS.  &quot;Maid of Hydra&quot; was resumed by the     crew  and offioe staff.     Tiie Communist Party  has  continued to take an  activeinterest in  the strike and  on august 4th issued a  manifestocovering its programme, which was fully quoted in  the Press:                                                    on/
   August 12th another manifesto&apos;was issued over the signature of Thomas Bell, in the oourse of which the strikerswere urged to:         &quot;Remember that while you have been concentrating    on London, the officials of the fransport.and&apos; General    Workers&apos; Union&apos;have been conducting their, propaganda .    in all other ports end telling the workers there all    about the efforts to form a new union. &apos;:&apos;  THE PRESENT    POLICY OP YOUR STRIKE COMMITTEE IS PLAYING RIGHT INTO    BE YIN&apos;S HANDS.         &quot;You didn&apos;t strike to form a new union, you struck    for bread.  That can be won.  But only when there iB    complete unity in the ranka.  are the, employers forming,    new unions?  YOU ENOW, THAT THEY ARE NOT.  Whore do YOU i,    stand.  Ic this a fight against a wage reduction or to V    form a new union?  Ask these questions and see that    you get an answer.         &quot;The Communist Party repeat - YOU CAN&apos;T WIN THIS    EIGHT ON YOUR OWN.   You must extend it.  If your strike    committee declare this to be Impossible,  then demand to    know \fcat the next steps are to be.  The,  Communist    Sarty insists that until you have sent your delegates    to other ports in an endeavour to win their support you    don&apos;1i know what oah be done.  If h:lf the time that has    been spent in forming the new union had been spent in  f    bold and vigorous propaganda to extend the strike, it  &apos;    would have been won by now.&quot;.  &quot;&apos;
