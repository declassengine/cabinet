           I refer to  the Memorandum CP.4249  ef my predecessor&apos; dated the 30th  September, 1922, en the  aubjeot of the  Scottish  National War Memori%I.  .-. In it he stated  that he  had been  informed by the D&amp;ce  ef Atholl that sufficient aubacriptiahs&apos;  for- the purpose of the  essential, part&apos; of  the  Memorial  had been .  received;  and.the submiBBion;ef a further Memorandum/te the  Cabinet, before definite action was taken, was premised.           At the end  of last year and&apos;the beginning -of this  there was a considerable newspaper controversy .en the  subject::  fears were expressed  that the execution of the. designs then  under consideration would injuriously affect  the  familiar.     &apos;i:y  sutlineo &quot;of the Castle  and that buildings out of  harmony with  ::  the  existing buildings  would be erected.           An alternative&apos; scheme has now been  submitted, under  which the old North Barracks  (Billing&apos;s Building) will not be  pulled down, but&apos;.-will be adapted inside for the purpose of  a Memorial Gallery;   it is also proposed  that an  apsidal Bhrine,  of  a height which will  make no material alteration in  the  &apos;  Skyline, shquld.be abutted on to the  north elevation of the  building.   The new propt-sals have been approved  by the  Ancient Monuments Beard for Scotland.         .  I have also consulted the Seoretary of  State for War.  who  hae assured me that the carrying  out  of this  scheme will  in  no way interfere with military requirements at the Castle.           The Memorial  Committee hold sufficient  funda for the  carrying out- of the Scheme:   they have&apos;also offered an endow-  ment ef at least  4,000 for the maintenance of the Memorial  whioh will consequently involve&apos;&apos;little  charge if  any upon  the  State.                ;.-&apos;-.. .&apos;: -           I am  of opinion that Hhe Scheme should  be approved:,,  :-.y  I save discusBed the.matter with the  first Commiesioner of  Works whs concurs in  my view  and has  obtained the sanction of..  the Treasury to the cost of maintenance being borne by his  department, in  the event-of the Cabinet sanctioning the Scheme.           I recommend that I  should be  empowered  to authorise  the carrying out of the Scheme hiw put  forward by the  .  Committee and  thatthe.  First -Commissioner should  be arapewered  to  make any&apos; arrangements for  its execution that say be  R**e4ea?y*        *&apos;&quot;                     - i  .        &apos; NOVAR&apos; .   ,    _______Scottish Office,..    &apos; Whitehall ,&apos; S.W.T..24th  July! -1923.-
