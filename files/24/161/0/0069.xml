Estimate if ore cast for 1924/5Memorandum by the Financial Secretary of the Treasury          In my memorandum  of  the 11  June  last  (C.P0269(  ))I laid before my Colleagues a  statement  of the  probablefinancial position for 1924/25*          I feel it my duty now to  lay before them theposition, as it appears at  the present time,  particular-ly as various sohemes for the  expenditure  of public money in the coming winter are coming before the Cabinet onWednesday.          In the memorandum referred  to  I  stated that&quot;so far as estimates can at present be framed the ap-proximate probabilities for 1924/5 are Revenue  760millions;   expenditure (-without allowing  for savings) 800 millions.    The Treasury hope to get  10 millions from a betting tax................  and have justissued a circular asking for reductions in OrdinarySupply Expenditure of  30 millions&quot;.........1 Qi .3
          The Total Supply Services Expenditure  in the  budget for the current year 1983/4 was (excluding supplementary estimates)  436,146,000,          Of this the Special Expenditure (i,e.e  War remanets)represented  15,.603,000 and Ordinary Expenditure represented 420,543,000,          It is this figure of 480. millions which the Treasuryhoped to see reduced hy 30 millions.          The Treasury circular of the 1st June  was addressedto the 12 principal spending departments. The  votes for whichthey are responsible covering about  340 million,approximately80$ of the total of Supply expenditure.          The returns have now been received and show thefoil owing re sul ts,       A.

          Thus the net decrease on the above  Civil  VotesOrdinary; Expenditure     ,     *      11.364.000  ,        It should he noted that the provisionalestimates for the Board of Education and Education  (Scotland)are based upon the assumption that the 5$ SuperannuationDeduction from teachers1 salaries is continued.   should this deduction be allowed to lapse the ProvisionalEstimates would have to be increased by the following sums  -                 Board of Education      1,925,000                 Education (Scotland)      289,000                                         2,214,000and the net reduction on Civil Ordinary Expenditure wouldthereupon amount to only -                     9,150.000          On the most favourable assumption therefore viz.,that the above superannuation deduction is made and thatthe extra half million pounds is not required for AirExpenditure the reduction as estimated would  be on ordinary expenditure  3,590,000:  on the least favourableassumption, the reduction would be  876,000 only.          The reduction in special expenditure will bemore than counterbalanced by the falling off,  if not the disappearance, of special revenue, and should be disregarded.          The above figures speak for themselves.   Theoutlook for next year&apos;s Einanee is certainly not less
 anxious  than it was when the .Budget speech was delivered,, The  Revenue  is bound to feel the  effect of this years tax  redactions and of  the prolonged depression of trade. On the other hand  the  Government  is pledged to a policy of balancing its Budget, of debt  reduction, and of reduction  of expenaltare.  It  has already incurred heavy commitments  e,g. for Agricultural Rates Grant  3-g- millions which must in any  case he an addition to this years original estimates.    Under the present conditions and at existing rates of  taxation a deficit of 40 millions is well within sight.  This represents the equivalent of Od* on the  Income Tax4          I  feel that  the situation is so serious that some immediate decision should be taken by the Cabinet, I suggest that as  regards the flighting Services recourse should he had to the expedient of &quot;rationing,1   I propose that an inclusive  sum  say  112,500,000 (as against the present proposal for  127 millions) should he allotted to these services and. that the Admiralty, War Office and  Air Ministry should he directed to prepare Estimates for 1924/5 not to exceed 52 millions,  4S millions and 14-J- millions respectively.    The 3 Departments  should at the same time be directed  to prepare statements showing in what respect services essential to the  Defence  of the Empire would have to be curtailed or postponed if  their estimates were kept down to the above name! figures.  Such reports might he  considered  by the Committee of   Imperial Defence before the end  of  October, and  the Committee might also be asked  then to report whether in their opinion the allocation  be tureen  the three
services should he modified.    So as to  enable  an essentialservice to be restored without increase  of the  allottedtotal.          The sums named ebove are of course arbitrarybut it may be pointed out that they compare as  followswith the Exchequer Issues for the year 1922/3               Army    I        45,400,000               Navy            56,200,000               Air Force        9,400 ,000 111,000 , 000          As regards Civil Departments,  the provisionalestimates are being examined in t he Treasury and every endeavour will be made to effect further reductions.    Atthe present moment it does not appear necessary to suggestthat a special Cabinet Committee should  be appointed  toexami ne t hem.          It does not appear likely that large reductionswill be possible in the estimates  of the remainingdepartments not included in those  to which the Treasurycircular was despatched.
       It will  be seen from the above that If^no Cabinet   agrees with  ay. propo-sals^fpr-jrationin&amp; the fighting services,   the saving on this years ordinary supply estimates will   be                      Civil Bepts,         11,364,000                           lighting Services. .   4,390,000                                                15,754,000   leaving a sum of  14-jr- millions to be made up oat of increased   taxation next year if farther savings  cannot be made on.   Civil Services.  Otherwise the savings in sight are about   3&amp; millions  only, leaving 26-1 millions to be made up by   taxation, both these figures being on  the assumption that   in addition  10 million can be raised by a Betting fax.        In this connection I would refer  to my memorandum of   to-day&apos;s date relative to this year&apos;s  Budget, and would   point oat that to the extent that additional expenditure is   approved whether for Unemployment, Empire Development,  . or the. numerous miscellaneous requests that reach me   almost&quot; daily, the Badget figures for 1924/5 will be still   more unfavourable,,July, 19230
