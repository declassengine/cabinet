              employees who joined the Special Sections of the Royal              Engineers were-entitled, exceptionally, to receive both              their civil and, military pay in full, without deductions,                        On 7th September, 1915, the first War Bonus              was announced to Post Office employees, and payment of              bonus was made to men on military service except in the              case, of&apos;&quot;single men and of men attached to the Special              Sections of. the Hoyal Engineers,,                        On 9th September, 1916, the first War Bonus              was granted generally to Civil Servants and was included              for the purpose of calculating balance of civil pay, if              any, in the case of married men serving&quot;with His Majesty1              Forces, but not in the case-of single men.or widowers                                  of -        .              without dependants or/&apos;men in the Special Sections of the              Royal Engineers.  The original War Bonus was increased              from time to time during the war as the cost of living              rose;  the increases being given to men on Service other              than single men and men attached to the Special Sections              of the Royal Engineers.SUTSrOE OASE.   3,     ,   In the Sutton Case it was- in, effect decided              by the House of Lords that the Petitioner who had enlists              in a Special Section of the Royal Engineers on the 7th*              September., 1915 (the date on which the first Post Office              War Bonus was announced) was entitled to receive ao part              of his &quot;full civil pay&quot; the arrears of War Bonus which              had been-withheld from him throughout his military sorvic              It may bo noted that this decision was reached by a              -majority (3 to 2) of the Lords after the Court of First              Instance had found for the Petitioner and the,Court of              Appeal had reversed th2s decision in favour of the Crown,

CiyilServants who are, or may be, affected by the SuttonJudgment,   It is estimated,: however,,-that the costof  paying claims,admittedly covered by the Judgmentwould amount to  1,250,000. in the Post Office alone..In. addition,.however, there are other very-largecategories of Civil Servants to whom the Sutton Judg-ment  may be applicable.   JFor example, in-.the Post office the total number of men who served in the SpecialSections of the Uoyal .Engineers was about 24,500, ofwhom roughly half enlisted,on or before the 7thSeptember, 1915, and so are clearly covered by theSutton Judgment,.  If tho remaining 12,250 who enlistedafter the 7th September, 1915, are oovered by the judgment, the additional cost in their case alone wouldbe  about  1,250,000-,   On the assumption that theGovernment is liable in all doubtful -cases the total amount involved might reach a figure of between  5,000,000and  6,000,000,..two-thirds of which would roughly beattributable to the Post Office, -SES CLEARLY     5,...

After careful consideration of the  , -                Opinion of the Law Officers on the Cases submitted tp...&apos;                them,- the Committee examined the three following                alternative methods of procedure i-                       (i)  The immediate introduction-of          .                            legislation for the purpose  of    -                         . -&apos;removing doubts and preventing                            the prosecution of claims, by                            Civil Servants (including Post         ;  -                            Officeemployees) who-enlisted&apos;                          &apos;.- after the 7th -September, 1915. :&apos; .

On the other hand the Committee  consider that
the obscurity of the legal position, the fact that theclaims are largely based on technicalities rather thanon merit, and the magnitude of the financial considerations involved, make the policy of payment without further enquiry in the doubtful cases unreasonable and inequitablefrom the tax payer&apos;s point of view.          The&apos;Committee are accordingly in favour of theadoption of the third alternative,&apos; namely, the submission to the Courts of test cases with a view to obtaining withthe least, possible delay decisions of the House of lords on the various outstanding legal questions.  .The Committeeare informed that given good-will it should be possibleto. obtain the decisions of.the House of Lords before theend of the current calendar year, and they feel that thecourse suggested could readily be defended on the groundthat the Law Officers having advised that the effect ofthe Sutton Judgment on cases not in terms covered by itwas doubtful and that even if applied the judgment wouldnot give every claimant full benefits,  the Government had decided to facilitate the obtaining of the highest legaldecisions with a view to removing doubts in the outstandingcases.   The Government would in any case bear the expenseof the contemplated litigation, but would make no further payments (over and above payments in cases clearly coveredby the Sutton Judgment) until the decisions of the Houseof Lords had been obtained.        The Committee agreed to recoomend the Cabinet -         (1) To authorise an immediate announcement             being made,to the effect that having  .             regard to tho doubtful legal position             it &quot;had been decided to facilitate the         .             submission to the Courts of test cases             with a view to decisions being reached             as soon as possible by the House of Lords                          5.                     ;  . .
