July 1923.SECRET.C.P.-354  (23).(Also N D. (R) 4.)                                 CABINET.SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL AND  IMPERIAL  DEFENCECOMMITTEE ON  RELATIONS  BETWEEN  THE  NAVY  AND  THE                            AIR  FORCE.THE CONTROL OF NAVAL AIR  WORK.                 Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.    THE essential factor of  all naval work is that it is based on the unit of the ship.The  ship,  as itself the  real instrument of war, dominates everything, and by  thenecessity of  economising space, absorbs every other element into  it  and allows ofno other basis of  organisation.  Its guns are part of it there is no  room in navalorganization for batteries or  brigades.  Its  marines may, when landed, be organizedin battalions  and companies;  on  board they are each  individually  allotted to their peace duties  or  battle stations.  Marines,  gunners, wireless and torpedo specialists,paymasters, writers, cooks, all have to perform not only  their specialist  duties, but,for the sake of economy of men and space, any other  duties that the Captain mayprescribe.  There is no  room  for  specialist  passengers.  The Navy  knows  of noallegiance at sea except to the ship,  and  through the ship to the Service.                   &quot; The strength of the Ship is the  Service,                   &quot; And the strength of  the Service the Ship.&quot;    This elementary condition of  naval efficiency applies to naval air work as to allother forms of naval work. The work is done in and from ships, which  are part of theFleet whose movements are directed by the  Commander of the Fleet, and which mustbe controlled by the Captain of the ship and for efficiency must be controlled by him in every respect, tactical as  well as  administrative.   The conception of the aircraft carrier  as  a  floating aerodrome from  which air forces, organised  in flights andsquadrons, co-operate with the  Fleet at the  nominal orders of  the Admiral, but reallyupon those of the  Senior Air Officer attached to his Staff,  is no doubt based upon the analogy of Air Force co-operation with the Army on land   But it is wholly inapplicableat sea.   In land warfare, co-operation  on the basis of separate forces is possible.   TheAir  Commander chooses  his  own sites for  his aerodromes  at any convenient distance from the front,. retains  his  own organisation intact,  directs  the tactical operationswithout  interference  and, iu the last  resort, is himself the real judge of the risks hewill run or the casualties he will  allow his force to suffer.  In a naval action  the admiral must handle his aircraft carriers as  he would any other part of  the Fleet, andmust be the only judge of. when, where and  to what extent his aircraft are to be throwninto the scale.  All this  postulates a  unified control, a complete identification  of  thenaval airmen with  their ships and with the Service, and  a corresponding  permeationof the whole Navy with  an understanding  of air work, as of submarine or destroyerwork, which.are impossible under the  present system.    The present system  tends to friction, to waste of personnel and  consequently, inview, of the ever-present problem of stowage, to loss of fighting strength.   It presentsthe  anomaly that, while  the  Air officers  aud men have  to come temporarily under a naval discipline which they do not understand, and are subject to punishment by the      [9741] [10404]
 Captain, their prospects  of  promotion are entirely  independent-of the judgment of those who  will have to  depend  on them in action.  It is  this which has,  in  fact, wrecked  all schemes for seconding Naval- officers to the  Air Force for naval work, because no Naval officer can afford to drop out of  the competition for promotion.  But the situation is hardly less difficult for  Air officers.  They are detached from  the main body of the Air Force  and from the best opportunities of attracting attention and gaining promotion  by good  work.  In peace, and with the present distribution of the Navy, they are  still  to some extent  under the eye of the Coastal Area Commander- i.e., of  headquarters in London.  But  when  the  Navy is mostly in the Mediterranean or east of Singapore, when it can afford more fuel and is therefore more at sea, and above all when it is actually at war, the Air Force officers with the Fleet will be almost entirely cut off from any  contact with the rest of the  Air Force.  The system will then inevitably break down and the Air officers themselves  will demand that their promotion should depend  on those  who know their work and for whom and by  whose orders it is done.     These  are  very serious  objections to the  present system.  What  is even more serious is that there is nothing to imbue  the higher ranks of  the Navy progressively with the understanding of what  the Air arm is capable of, as they are imbued with the understanding of what  destroyers, submarines,  torpedoes, &amp;c, can do.   This is fatal to true  fighting efficiency.  On the  other  hand, as long as there  is no real air sense in the higher ranks of  the Navy, and no feeling that the Air arm is an integral and irremovable part of the  Navy, there will  always  be the tendency in the Admiralty Staff to be slow  in extending  the use of the Air arm,  at any rate in replacement of any of the older arms.  The only effective way  to  avoid the extravagance of duplication of functions is to make the air work  an integral part of the naval work,  and to give the Navy a direct inducement to lift itself out of the water to the utmost extent that the progress of aviation may warrant.     One argument  advanced in defence of  the  existing system is that it is essential to keep the naval airmen part of  the main Air Force in order  to keep them up to the highest  standard of  efficiency in the latest development of  air  tactics.  But  this argument does not apply  to the bulk of the personnel who are engaged in looking after and handling the machines. The work of doing this in  a ship is so  different from work in an aerodrome that  all  the advantage, apart from the economy of personnel already referred to, is on  .the side of its being done by naval men.  It  does not apply to  flying on and ..off  ships,  which is a very specialised form of work.  It does not apply to reconnaissance, where the essential thing is not only to recognise ships, but to divine their probable movements and intentions and to report about  them that which a Naval Commander wants  to know.  It does not apply to spotting for naval gunnery or, to any extent, to bombing or  air torpedo attack, which is essentially an operation of the same character  as destroyer attack.  It really applies only  to the pilots of  lighter machines, a small fraction of the total, and could- be met by  sending  naval officers who wished to specialise in fighter work to occasional courses for higher training under the Air Ministry or  by seconding a percentage of  Air  Force lighter specialists to naval air work,     A  variant of this argument  is the argument that uniformity of  training and tradition is  essential to co-operation  between  naval aircraft and aircraft under the Air Ministry working from the shore.  The Chief of the Air Staff has even gone so far as to suggest that this will always be the case, and that no naval action  can take- place in future outside the range  of  shoregoing aircraft.   As a matter of fact, except for the one war, which is now over and not likely to recur, viz., a war with Germany, it would be safer to say that our naval actions will  never be  fought within range of our own aerodromes.   In a  war with France  the  main  theatre  of naval  operations  would probably he the  Mediterranean.   Our  Fleet  would be all  the  time within range of some shore, no  doubt.  But  it would be on enemy shore or a neutral shore, and only within a comparatively small radius of Gibraltar, Malta, or in the eastern corner of  the Mediterranean, would the  Fleet  be able to  rely on the effective support of shore-based Squadrons.  In  the  case  of  an oceanic war with America and Japan, shore-based air support, would be even more lacking.   In such a war the Fleets might  be moving all over the Pacific  or South Atlantic, as Von Spee and his opponents did in the late war, and the decisive actions might take place at points just as remote from our aerodromes as Coronel or the Falklands.                     ^     This  brings me to what  I cannot help thinking  to be the really strongest  under-lying motive in  the attitude of  the Air Ministry on  this question, namely, the belief that in an emergency all aircraft will have to be concentrated to eke out the inadequate
total strength of the Air Force,- and- ought, therefore meanwhile to be kept intact as one Force for that emergency.  The answer is that there is no conceivable emergency in which the Admiralty could possibly surrender what is a vital arm  of the Fleet.Take the extreme case for  this purpose  of  a  war with  France.   The  Navy in  theMediterranean would certainly require every  man  and every aeroplane of its air armto  hold  its  own  in an area  where it would  have to reckon with French  aircraft operating from Morocco, Algeria  and  Corsica, as well as from  EYance, in addition to;any Air Force with the French  Fleet.  The  Admiralty would  at once have to  insist that all machines and  personnel at the naval  air shore  bases remained ear-markedfor the  Navy,  and,  as those  bases  will no  doubt  in  future  be mainly  in  theMediterranean  or further  East,  they  would,  in any  case, not  be  available  for  homedefence.  The shore-based aircraft  at  Gibraltar, Malta and  in  the Middle East wouldalso have  to be retained to support the Mediterranean  operations operations essentialnot only for the defence of our trade routes and possessions, but as  the most effective means of  offence by separating France from her North African possessions.    If the Air  Force without  the Naval Air  Wing is  insufficient to protect  Londonagainst a possible French air attack, it should be strengthened.  But it is essential atj/ie outset to face the fact that the naval machines and personnel will never, in any seriouswar, be available for any other purpose  than  the work with and from the  Fleet.   Andif  so, it is futile to base the organization of  naval air loorh on a  system unsound forthe only purpose for which it will be  required in order to prepare for a hypotheticalsituation which  cannot in fact arise.    There is, lastly, the objection to the proposed full control by the Navy of  its ownair work,  which is based on the idea that each Service ought to have  the completemonopoly of  its own element.   No  such rigid  monopoly really exists as  between the older Services.   The Army has never  objected, on principle, to the Navy conductingoperations on shore with its own personnel.  Nor has the Navy ever objected to theArmy  manning  its own pontoons,  boats,  or even steamers, when  the  occasion  hasdemanded, or owning its own transports.  At the same time, the operations of the twoolder Services, in fact, overlap so little that each very naturally tends to  confine itselfto its own element.  But the Air is an element common to all three Services, and while there is a very strong case for an independent Air Service, that does not constitute, initself, a case  for denying to the other Services the use of tactical weapons or of methodsof locomotion which are destined to become increasingly important to each of them.The development of the future may  very well  bring a type of flying  boat  that will be mainly a surface craft, though  capable  of flying short distances  for jumping  overbooms or  for torpedo attack,   ft would  surely be absurd to  insist, in the name of the&quot;unity of the air,&quot; on double crews  for this one of seamen, while it  touches the surface, and  one of airmen, who  take over as  it rises off the waves !   The flying  tankor torpedo thrower for  land  operations may also come some  day instruments capableof  flying  only  a  few miles and obviously by their character and tactical purposeintended to be part of the Army.  In  time to  come, too, troops  in  the front line  mayregularly  receive their rations and ammunition  by small short-range  aeroplanes orhelicopters.  To insist that these should be  not under  the  Army but under  anotherService, with large and entirely separate strategical duties of its own, would  clearly be unreasonable.   The practical  conclusion  surely is  that, while  it may be desirable tohave a separate Air Service for independent  air operations, and for  such co-operationwith the Army and  Navy as can  most conveniently be given by it, there should be noprohibition,  on  grounds  of  abstract  principle, against either of  the other Servicesdoing for itself such air work  as is  more efficiently done as an integral part of its ownfighting organization                                                      (Initialled)      L.
