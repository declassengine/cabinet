PURCHASE.

1. It was agreed:-

(i) That the Speech of Lord Birkenhead on 13th July, 1921 (see I.A.C. 39,p.3) could not be regarded as pledging the Government to pay to the landlords the difference (estimated at Â£?,000,000) between the price which they would have received under the Land Bill, of 1920, and the price which they would receive under the Bill now before the Free State Parliament; nor to secure the passage of a Bill identical with the Bill of 1920, but only to secure the passage of an equitable Bill.



(ii) That in reply to Lord Midleton&apos;s motion of 23rd July, the Duke of Devonshire should take the line that Lord Birkenhead&apos;s pledge was sufficiently fulfilled by the Land Bill now before the Free State Parliament.



(iii) That before the 23rd instant, the Duke of Devonshire should see Lord Midleton and inform him confidentially that the British Government intended to guarantee the Land Stock to be issued for the purposes of the Bill; and should also consider a form of words by which, without disclosing the fact of the guarantee, he could satisfy the House of Lords that there was no serious apprehension of the Stock falling substantially below par.



HORMSBY ? REPORT.

2. SIR W. JOYNSON-HICKS stated that the Treasury were prepared to concur in both the concrete financial proposals contained in the Report, namely, that outstanding claims by the British Government against the Free State Government should be deferred until the autumn, and that the British Government should agree to make advances to the Free State Government if asked by them to do so, from the Criminal Injuries Vote. He thought, however, that any such advances should be limited to the amount actually expended by the Free State Government in the payment of compensation.
