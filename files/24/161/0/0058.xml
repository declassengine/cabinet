THE PXtTAETCXAL POLICY OP GREAT BRITAIN IN REGARD                                                 (\ Q 1    10 SEPARATIONS AND INTER-ALLIED DEBTS.       &quot; ^ J     1,   It seems desirable at the present Juncture toset out some main facts of reparation finance -          Shere are three quite distinct issues -     [A)  how much Germany must pay!     (B)  hew such payments are to he distributed          among the Allies:     (0)  the settlement of inter-allied indebtedness.     2.   A,   to^ffl^JSU^yMffl^^WTt          This is the first and in some ways, simplestissue.   So fax as it is an economic problem assistance maybe expected from the advice of economic experts but it mustnot be forgotten thaijit is also a psychological problem and theabTTity* to pay may alter with the will to do so.   To begin by considering hew particular allies should fare and to workbaok to the question of What Germany must pay, leads nowhere,I will assume that there is economically a maximum limit toGermany1 s capacity to pay.   It is useless to ask more andthere is no question of asking less, for everyone is agreedthat the maximum is below what the Allies have the right to demand.          Very many attempts have been made at differentdates to assess Germany&apos;s capacity, ranging from under 1,000 millions to  24,000 millions.   The only figures whiohneed fer present purposes be considered are those of (a) theLondon Schedule of Payments (May 1921), (b) the BritishParis plan (Jamary 1923), and (o) recent Germar offers(June 1923),     3*   The Schedule of Payments (May 1921) represents themain attempt to assess German liabilities under the treaty and to provide for their payment.
          The Reparation Commission adopted a figure of  492 6,660,000,000 for German liabilities, te whioh sum must beadded the war debt transferred from Belgium to Germany&apos;by &quot;theTreaty itself, (about  300,000,000), the cost cf the armies of Occupation which at December 1922 had reached  120millions, and some smaller items.   The Capital debt was thusdetermined not on an estimate of Germany&apos;s capacity to paybut on an estimate of the Allies&apos; title to damages,          The machinery by which this liability was to be discharged took the form of A and B bonds to the total of50 milliard gold marks ( 2,500,OOOiOOO) and C bonds to.thetctal of 82 milliard gold marks  .^,100,000,000),   The costs of Occupation were to be paid in oashi   The Belgian debtwhich under the Treaty itself was to be liquidated in 5,years,has subsequently been replaced by A, B and C bonds.          All these bonds bear 5f* interest and 1% sinkingfund, giving them a 27 year period.   The difference betweenthem is that all the A and B bonds were to bear interest asfrom different dates in 1921;   the 0 bonds were only tobecome operative as Germany&apos;s financial circumstancespermitted.          To meet the service of the A arid B bonds  150,000,000per annum would be necessary (about four times our payment  to america),   If the C bonds also  had been issued in fullGermany would have had to pay nearly  360 millions  a year,in addition to costs of occupation etc.    The actual demandunder the Schedule on Germany was however for a fixed annuityof  100,000,000 together with a  further annuity equal to 26^cf the value of German exports,    Before the value of theseannual payments can be estimated, some assumption must bemade as to the value of German Exports in normal circumstancesAssuming that they reached  250,000,000 a year,  Germany wouldare were  to be  2,500 million A and B bonds,  4,100 million C bondsIthe Belgian debt of say  300 million.  But Germany could set offlain oeded property against the grand total.&apos;  Her actual liabilityOliver  bonds may be put at  2,500 million A and B bonds and  3,500lion C bonds.  At 6% the A and B bnnds require  150 million a yearPhe C bonds  210 million.
pay for reparations under this plan  165,000,000 a year;if exports  reached  500,000,000, Germany would pay 230,000,000 a year.   The coat of occupation was apparently to he paid in addition to these sums,          The framere of the plan assumed that the annual payments would suffice to cover the service of A and Bbonds ( 150,000,000),   later as Germany&apos;B prosperityincreased and German exports increased in value, theReparation Commission might issue C bonds, the service ofwhich would absorb Germany&apos;s Excess capacity to pay,     4,   Brbfl&amp;down of the. Schedule of Payments.          The sum demanded under the Schedule cf PaymentJwao thus based sn an assessment of the. damages to which theAllies were entitled.   The Reparation Commisoion with thespeolfic authority of the several Governments hare power toreduce the German debt, but have not approached the Govern-ments in that sense.   By the devioe, however, of C bondsthe actual payments demanded from Germany in the earlier years were mush below those required for the service of a capital debt of  6,600,000,000 and from time to time a moratorium has been granted by Germany,          But these devices have for the present at all events failed and the Allies have not succeeded in obtainingfrom Germany even the fixed annuity of  100 millions a year.In considering the actual present value of the bonds the nominal total must be written down very severely.  A yearfcgo the Rapporteur-&quot;&quot;of the French Budget Committee, withrather disconoerting frankness, valued the A and B bondsas actually worth  1,950,000.000 and the 0 bonds as worth 500,000,000,   If these estimates were correct in July 1922the value of the bonds to-day must be very eubstantiallylower having regard to the deterioration in the german financial position.   But these may be what financiers calla lock up and^taice in 20 years&apos; time even to the C bonds  if germany with her increasing population really puts her house in orderjbut this is purely speculative and in my view the                           - 3 -
                                                   A A 4C Bonds are clearly worth nothing to-day,             $     5,   This is the reason^taken to the writing down ofthe capital debt of Germany to some such figure ao 2,500,000,000?   The objection is also to be found inconnection with Inter-Allied debts.   The C bonds may be worth Very little, as most Frenchmen would admit, or nothingat alii which is the view of many British experts, but theFrench Government hope eventually to persuade Great Britainand the United States to take these bonds at their face  value in settlement of Pranoe&apos;s sterling debt of  600 millions toGreat Britain and gold debt of  ?50 million to the U.S.A.Neither Government has ever entertained this notion, which means giving up relatively good money for paper Which formany  years  must be worthless,     *     (b)  British      at Paris January 1923.     6,   It is unnecessary to consider the technical detailsof this plan.   Its essential features wore insistence as a preliminary on the reform of German finance, the grant of a moratorium for not less than 2 or more than 4 years and the fixing of German liabilitios of every kind, i.e, for Belgiandebt and cost of occupation as well as for reparations,  ata definite figure of  2,500,000,000, present value.          Provision was made for a small reduction in totalliabilities if recommended by an impartial body consideringthe position in 10 years&apos; time, and generous terms wereoffored Germany for speedy payment.          The minimum sum for whioh Germany could liquidateall liabilities was  1,775,000,000 and that only on the  veryimprobable assumption that she would be in a positionimmediately to raise very large international loans,     (c)  German offer of 2nd May, ^.923.     7,   -This offer was at certain point obscurelyworded and it is not clear whether at the maximum germany was offering  1,500,000,000 or a somewhat lower figure suchas  1,300,000,000,    In the event, which is practically                          m 4 -
  a certainty,  of her failing  to  raise  largo  international  loans her liability would havo  been limited to  about  ,^800,000,000,       B,   How German -payments ^re to  be distributed amon/;  the Allies,       8,   The Spa. Conference,            It  has already been explained that the   6,600,000,000  of the Schedule of Payments  represents results  from a  valuation of  the damage suffered by the Allies  from German  aggression by land, by sea and  from the air:  and not from  an estimate of Germany&apos;s capacity to  pay.            Such damages fall  into two  main  groups  (a)  war  pensions and  allowances (b)  material  damages,            Tho division  of tho  total  of  6,600,000:000 between  the Allies was not fixed by the Reparation Commission but at  a subsequent  conference at Spa  where  after various negotiations  the following percentages were  agreed among the Allies                 France         52                 British Empire 22*                 Italy         10                 Belgium         8                 Others        _8                      Total    JLOO       9.   Ever since it became  evidont that the optimistio  estimates of  Germany1s capacity to pay reparations held  in 1920-21 were not likely to be realised,  public opinion  in Prance and Belgium has been  ventilating variou:; schemes  for a settlement baaed on the grant of a priority for the  restoration of the devastated regions, accompanied by the  writing down  or cancellation of Inter-Allied debts0            Officially, this idea has been on several ocoaaions  expressed in  speeches by 1:1,  Polnoare&apos;, who  has stated that the  only basis on which tho French  Government  is prepared to  discuss a reduction of the German debt is  that  France and.....  2el-.;i&apos;-rum-Tj-ho^^13.15^ of tho British Bmpire share is assigned to  thedominions etc.
                                     *    and Belgium shoUld be assured of 26 ( 1,300,000,000)  and    5 milliards ( 250,000,000) respectively,  free of all    inter-allied debts, i.e. of the debts to  the United States    as well as to Great Britain,,              Unofficially, the same idea had been elaborated    in a more ingenious form, which has been suggested with some    variations by M, Loucheur and by M. Barnich, the Belgian    expert, and which has recently been given considerable    publicity in the &quot;Matin&quot;,              This scheme is that in the immediate future the    maximum possible amount of reparations should be capitalised    by means of loans.   Out of these loans should be met the    current annual payments made by Great Britian to the United    States:   the rest should be used to cover the capital    cost of reconstruction of the devastated areas,  which is    estimated at 26 to 30 milliards of gold marks ( 1,300,000,000    to  1,500,000,000) for Prance, 4 to 5 milliards ( 200,000,000    to  250,000,000) of gold marks for Belgium, and smaller sums    for Serbia, Italy  and Boumanla,   Thus, during the next 10 or    15 years, it is suggested that 35-40 milliards of gold marks    might be realised, of which Great Britain would receive the    amounts actually paid  during that period to America and the    rest would be used to extinguish the claims of the other    allies for the capital cost of the reconstruction of their    devastated areas.   At the end of that period the question    Bhould be examined whether Germany could contribute anything    more to the reimbursement of the different allied debts to    Great Britain and  to America,              Any of these proposals would entail most serious    sacrifices, and no little risk for the financial position    of this country.   It  is therefore desirable that the British    -            ......     &apos;. i&apos; &apos; &quot;.........-.........      ...........*26 milliards would be  the full Prench 52$ of 50 milliards,
British Government should examine them betimes and considerthe policy which it is to adopt.    10.  The proposal that some priority should be grantedto the devastated regions is based largely on the argumentsused (in another connection) by Mr.Keynes,   It is not,indeed, suggested by the French as liir.Keynea did, that theinclusion of pensions in the damages chargeable againstGermany was a breach of the fourteen points or of theconditions of the Armistice, but it is argued that pensionswere only included under pressure from Great Britain,who would otherwise have not been able to claim anysubstantial Bhare in reparations.    It is assumed that Great Britain suffered no material damages of any importance during the war.    11,  The two questions of pension charges and priority for French devastated regions are often confused by publicopinion in Great Britain, but there iB no real connection between them.    Even if pensions are not charged toGermany there would be nothing  illogical  in taking them into account as a factor for determining the distributionof German payments among the Allies,    The point of thepensions controversy was that more was being asked ofGermany than, as it was alleged, was proper under theArmistice terms, but to-day no  one seriously contends thatGermany can in full pay even so much as the mere materialdamages,    12.   s/hether or not it was expedient to include a claim  for pensions in the bill against Germany, that claimnow forms an integral part of the treaty settlement  and isbinding upon all the allies. It was on the basis of this
settlement that all subsequent discussions took place  and special concessions were granted to other Allies - e.g.the Belgian priority of  100 millions and the transfer toGermany of the Belgian war debts - because of their relatively small claim on account of pensions.   One feature of thesettlement between the Allies cannot now be reopened withoutreopening others,   The final result of these discussionswas embodied in the inter-allied percentages fixed at Spa,and even if the claims against Germany were written down bythe omission of pensions claims, there is no reason why  the reparations actually received,should not be apportionedbetween the allies on the basis of these percentages,    13, 1  Even assuming, however, that the treaty settlement where to be revised and the respective claims of all theallies limited to material damages, Great Britain would still be entitled to a very substantial percentage inrespeot of such losses.     The Reparation Commission has  neverpublished the detailed calculations on whioh it arrived  at its total estimate of damages of 132 milliard gold marks( 6,600,000,000), but the British Government were informedconfidentially of the valuations used by the Britishdelegate,  which were as follows:-                     Pensicns and    millisn                     allowances.

capacity to pay via in excess  of tho sum proposed by GreatBritain at Paris,    14,   So far as the Allied claim on Germany isconcerned, the question of including or excluding warpensions and allowances has lost itB meaning.    It tanproduce an effeot only on the proportions in which Germanpayments are divisible between the Allies,     Thefollowing table shove what this effect would be -                                 Spa pro-     Proportions                                 portions.    based on                                              Material                                              Damages only.

The bulk of the British claim,  of course,  consists of shipping 108899,*             Sunk ships and cargoesrotting  at the  bottom of the eea may not shook the eye likethe ruined villages of Prance, but they were equallyserious  losses  to the national wealth.* Note - these percentages have been calculated as explained above from the figures used by the British Delegate.  If weuse the crude figures of the claims as submitted to theReparation Commission by the Allies, the percentage figuresdo not differ much viz, Franoe 57, Great Britain 17.Belgium 12Italy 7,*  It will Tie contended that these losses were for the mostpart covered by insurance premiums whioh were laffely paidby the Allies.    There might be something in this if theAllied debts were fully met; but in aotual fact, there isno Bubstance in this contention.It should be noted that the sterling value of the hulls wasconverted by the Raparation Conmisaion into gold marks atthe rate of exchange&quot;of April 1921,  viz, 16.456 gold marksto the pound.    Had the rate of 20 g.m. to the   (whichcorresponds with the value of sterling during the war period and aleo approximately with itspresent value) been taken foxtMhulls as it was for the cargoes,  the British claim formaterial losses would be increased by about l/6th and ourpercentage in the above table would be cloae on 20.
          From the economic and finanaial points  of view it is still more difficult to justify the grant of  anypriority to the devastated regions.    The charges  for  thereconstruction of these regions are represented almostentirely by the cost of indigenous labour and raw materials,and by contractors&apos; profits,  and their effect on  the economic position of the countries in question is precisely  similarto that of the payments which the British Government hashad to make for the support of the unemployed ontImposition of this country,  with this difference,  thatthe reconstruction expenses have resulted in the  additionof real assets to the national wealth, whereas theunemployment dole adds nothing to our wealth.          From the finanpial point of view the sacrificesof our foreign investments, and particularly of our dollar securities, which Great Britain made freely  in thecommon cause, are much more serious than the destructionOf buildings and properties which can be repaired ( andhave  in fact already been largely repaired) by means of native labour and materials.          If, in addition to these losses, the British tax payer haB to pay the debt to America while not recoveringthe debts owed to her by her allies, and her alliessecure 26 or 30 milliards of gold marks from Germany itcan be affirmed that the financial position in which GreatBritain will emerge will be far less favourable thanthat  of her allies, and particularly of Franoe.         16.   The scheme proposed by the &quot;hat in&quot; isparticularly audacious as under it France would actuallybe better off than if the Schedule of Payments of 1921had been met in full and France had paid her inter-allied debts.    Under the Schedule of Payments, France could not
nave recovered  as  her Bhare  more  than abott  34 milliardsof gold  marks gross present  value ( 1700 millions)against  which she  would have been obliged  to pay the equivalent  of 12 milliards ( 600  million)  to Great Britainand 15 milliards ( 750 million) to the United States.      Ithas never been  suggested that France Bhould  not pay herInter-allied debtB if she recovered her full claim againstGermany.    17.   The real objeot, however, of all ti, se schemes,and particularly of the proposals put forward in the&quot;Matin&quot;  is,  not to :p.***in a priority jtfo^the  devastatedregions, eut fco app*Oi ^iate  to this purpose  all thereparation  payments which Germany will be  oapable of making.Although the fact may not be refleoted in officialutterances,  the French and Belgian experts have for semetime come to realise perfectly clearly that  30 or 40milliards of gold marks is the utmest that Germany isever likely to  pay.      Their proposal, therefore, would mean that Great  Britain might possibly receive out of germany the annuities she actually pays to America during a fewyears,say ten;   in the meantime the other allies wouldrecover the full amount of their capita^ claims in respectof the devastated regions.    At  the end of the period,there would be  nothing more  to be got from Germany whosecapacity would  be entirely absorbed in meeting the charges on the loans already raised, and  Great Britain would haveto pay the  subsequent annuities for another  fifty years to america out a,f her own resources.   It is  therefore essentialto maintain integrally the British olaim to  22% of whatever isreoeived from Germany, whether capital or  interest.                              wilt.
    18.   The prospect of Germany raising any loans is,at the present moment extremely remote,  but^  if a settlement could he arrived at whioh would enable Germany to have a&quot;breathing space in order to reestablish her financialposition, it is not inconceivable that in a comparatively short time some such operation would again become possible.          The success of any operations of this kind would naturally depend on the-&apos; reception itahich might be given tothem by the London market,     As the charge for reconstructionia not represented by external debts but by internal debt,any loans raised would have, sooner or later, to be convertedfrom sterling into the national currencies of our allies,If loanB were raised on any considerable scale, the transferof wealth abroad in thiB way, concurrently with the payments made by us to the United States, and in the absence of anysubstantial new receipts from abroad, would constitute avery serious danger to our financial position, and. itwould  appear essential to provide some safeguard or controlover the amounts whioh would be issued in the London market.For this reason the British proposals of last Januaryincluded a provision that while we were prepared tofacilitate the raising of loans on the London market aspart of any general settlement the proceeds could not be diverted without British consent to the redemption of bondsheld by other Powers, though exceptionally we agreed that 50%of loans raised before 1927 should be applied to the  :redemption of bonds held by France.        The proper course is for the bulk of the loans to be raised by Germany in thecountries which are to receive the money.         19,   The british debt to the United States ofAmerica has been funded at $4;600,000,OOO which is  945,000,000at par of exchange or  1/000.000,000 at today&apos;s rate ofapproximately $4.60 to the  .

The  main declarations hy Great Britain on thesubject of Inter-Allied  deuts nave been -      (i)   the Balfour  Note of 1st August 1922 -           &quot;In no circumstances do we  propose to askmore from  our debtors  than is necessary to pay to ourcreditors.    And,  while we do not  ask for more, all willadmit that we can hardly be content with less.&quot;           In  other words,  Great Britain will demand  from her debtors the amount she owes America less whatever  sherecovers  from Germany.     The position of the  rest  of theEmpire must not be overlooked.    They have been promised13.15$ of  the Empire  reparation receipts.    To enable usto pay this sum we must  obtain more than the amount  ofthe Anerican  debt,  which latter  is  a  charge on GreatBritain only,     (ii)   the British plan at Paris  (January, 1923)  -           Great Britain was prepared  to accept, apart from the  gold deposited by Franoe and Italy, German bonds in replacement of the direct  obligations of her Allies.- She would  have received,  it was estimated, the  equivalent of a present  payment  of  900 million,  i.e. a little  lessthan her  American debt.     21.    Ha solution of  either  inter allied debts  or reparations would seem practicable  on the basis of France
being guaranteed 51,300 million and Belgium  250 millioniGermany&apos;s capacity to pay may not even equal  1,500 millions-  in which case Great Britain is-left to pay  the United             fStates:nearlyll,000 millions and Italy gets nothing atall;  4.w the butside Germany&apos;s capacity can now scarcelyequal  2,500 millions- i- in which case if Great Britaincollects a sum equal to her debt to United States ofAmerica,  Italy can get nothing,    In either case theUnited States bf America it is supposed, would be content to collect nothing fromthe European Allies though theyowe her over  1,000 millions. - The United States hasrepeatedly declared that she recognises no necessaryconnection between the debts of Germany to the Alliesand the debts of the Allies to her.     This position isfounded on common sense.          As explained above the G.  bonds are, for practical purposes,  valueless.    To offer to pay debts in C. bondsis in effect repudiation,     22.    As regards Inter-Allied debts a slight departure from the  standpoint taken in the BalfOu.&apos; Note seems oalledfor.  To  insist,  ab initio, that Great Britain shall receivesufficient to cover hex: debt to America - though theclaim itself is abundantly justified on merits -  may tend&apos;to hamper the settlement of the first and most urgentproblem viz.  the determination of  Germany&apos;s present capacity.          The correct attitude would seem to be insistence on Germany&apos;s capacity and the British share of Germanpayments  being first  determined.    Then thiposition willbe reached that further sums are required by Great britain to make up the German payments to  what she owe3 America,,These sums will ba claimed from the  Allies whose  dabts  to
us.substantially exceed  the amount  involved.    But GreatBritain must extend to the Allies,  Individually, the sameconsideration as regards their own  capacity to pay, which isgiven to Germany.          To discuss Inter Allied Debts before a figure for germany has been reached and accepted by all the Allies isto invite spoliation and to deprive.this country of its mainweapon for securing a real settlement.     23.   It may be added that if  and when the time comes todiscuss inter-allied debts, it will be most undesirable toadopt the procedure of general conference for this purpose.Such a procedure would inevitably force all the continentaldebtors into one camp;   the British Government would inevitaby j                                                               I                                                               Ibe pressed to grant the same concessions to all the debtorstates, without regard to the differences which exist intheir -respective financial and economic situations, and inthe end we should probably be forced, willingly or un-wlllingly, to cancel our claims.    From.the financial pointof view the only procedure which oan be admitted In regard to  jthe settlement of inter-allied debts ia the discussion ofthis question between the individual debtor and creditordirectly.          The situation &amp;ight of course be altered (though not necessarily) if the United States were willing to join in a general inter-allied discussion;   but the American -Government would in all probability be quite unwilling to doso, for the reasons given above,  and any initiative taken bythe British Government  to call together such a conference would be very badly received by theme    It appears most undesirable therefore to cause friction with the UnitedStates when we have nothing to gain and everything to loseby it.                                                               1                                                               1
     24,   The inspired Prench Press has frequently repeated that Prance and Belgium have stated their minimum terms, andthat if there is any question of the reduction of the Germandebt, it is for Great Britain to state what her minimumterms are..   In view of the difficulty which there alwaysis in establishing our position at inter-allied discussions on questions whioh have been left open in the preliminarynegotiations it would appear desirable that at the first opportunity a definite statement should be made that themiriimura requirements of Great Britain are i   (a)   22% of all German payments;   (b)   should such payments (after deducting the Dominions&apos;         share of reparations) not be sufficient to cover         the amounts paid by us to the United States., the         balance would have to be made good out. of the debts         due to us by our Allies, in accwsedaiice with the         principle laid down in the Balfour Note.          It might also be indicated that if the situationin Germany is allowed to deteriorate further, and theprospect of drawing regular reparations payments made moreand more problematic, it will be much more diffioult toreduce our claims against the Allies.          These thoughts are submitted not as finalpronouncements upon a most difficult problem but for theconsideration of such of my Colleagues as may wish toconsider the position before we may be^ called upon to makea decision.26th July,  1923.
