[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1923.SECRET.CP.  377  (23).13CABINET.SPECIAL   REPORT   ON    UNEMPLOYMENT.        No.  97.     Period ended July 27,  1923.    The number  of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as whollyunemployed at the 23rd July was 1,184,900,  an increase of 4,239 over the previousweek.                 POSITION  IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.    Generally, there has been some slackening of activity due to various causes.In the Bristol and Forest of  Dean coal-fields the reduced demand for  house coalhas checked the steadiness of employment at some pits, but others  remain busy.The same cause accounts for diminished activity in the Midlands, where the positionis also affected by lack of demand on account of the  prolonged depression in thepottery industry and by delays in shipment caused by the dockers&apos;  dispute.   Inthe Yorkshire and Durham fields work is steady, apart from a local set-back dueto an explosion at the Maltby Main Colliery.  The Lancashire coal-field  shows afalling-off in activity.  Employment in Scotland has  remained good.   Trade isquiet in Wales, the output having been diminished owing to the incidence of theannual holidays.IRON AND STEEL.    There have been fluctuations in employment in the Midlands, but no material improvement can  be recorded.   Unemployment on  the North-East  Coast hascontinued acute, and prospects of future activity  are  still very poor.  Trade  inScotland is depressed, most firms having closed down  for an extended period overthe annual holidays.  Employment has been good in  North Wales,  and,  on  thewhole, satisfactory in South Wales.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.    Apart from a certain amount of repairing work, there is little activity at the yards on the South-West Coast.  On the North-East Coast the continuance of theindustrial dispute among the boilermakers has resulted in acute depression in theindustry, and allied industries are also adversely affected.  There is a fair amountof repair work being done on the Merseyside, but little constructional work.   no improvement is expected in Scotland until  the dispute is settled.  Although thesituation in Wales is unsatisfactory, a slight improvement has been noticed at theChannel ports.ENGINEERING.    The situation in London and the Home Counties is uncertain.  The improve-ment  in the South-West Counties has continued.   In the  Midlands seasonalSUMMARY  OF  UNEMPLOYMENT  SITUATION.
depression is adversely affecting employment in the motor and cycle section;  but ingeneral  engineering the  gradual  improvement  continues.    A  further  slightimprovement has occurred in Yorkshire and the North of England, and the outlookat some centres is hopeful.  Ma,rine engineering, however, is depressed as the resultof the boilermakers&apos; dispute.   In Lancashire unemployment and short-time workingcontinue.   The  annual holidays in  Scotland  have  been  extended in  many  casesowing chiefly to lack of  orders, but  some signs of improvement are evident.  in wales, the slow  and steady improvement has been maintained.TEXTILES. &quot;    Cotton. Employment in the fine spinning section in Lancashire has continuedsatisfactory, and mills spinning Egyptian cotton are generally  working full time.In the weaving  section no improvement can be reported and  production is stillconsiderably curtailed.   The depression in Yorkshire continues.    Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. The hosiery trade in the Midlands has shown a  slight  improvement.   In the  woollen  and worsted industry  the  position  is unsatisfactory  in Yorkshire with  much short-time  working, while a  decline  isnoticeable in Scotland.    Lace. In the Midlands some improvement is perceptible in  the lace curtainand plain net sections,  but there has  been a further decline in the Lever&apos;s section.    Silk. Unemployment remains considerable, and the immediate  outlook in theMidlands  is not  promising, as trade  usually becomes quieter  at this period of theyear.    Jute. Trade  has been quiet owing to the holiday  season.  The  outlookappears good.BUILDING.    There has been very little change in the position.   Employment generallycontinues  good, and the demand for  skilled operatives has not diminished.BOOT AND SHOE.    There has been little improvement in the South-Western Counties.   The recentimprovement in the Midlands has not been maintained.CLOTHING.    The dressmaking and millinery trades have improved in the London area, butthe wholesale  clothing - section  has been slack.  In  the  South-Western Counties,employment at some centres is good.   The position in the  Midlands is unchanged.POTTERY AND GLASS.   , Unemployment and short-time working in the pottery trade have  increased inthe Midlands.TRANSPORT.     The dispute at the London Docks continued and has affected other industries.Workers in the Bristol area have returned to work and are very  busy.  The disputehas  resulted in  decreased activity on the  North-East Coast, especially at Hull.Increased activity at other centres occurred owing to the diversion  of vessels fromports affected  by the dispute.  On the North-West Coast employment has generallybeen  resumed, and additional men are  being engaged to cope with the arrears ofwork.  A slight improvement  has been recorded in  South  Wales, but the generalsituation  is still unsatisfactory.                                             C. A.

In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transportissued circular letters to  Local Authorities inviting  them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which. Avith assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their  respective areas.  Approved schemes areassisted by grants  made on the same bases as heretofore.  In the case of schemesassisted by the  Unemployment  Grants Committee, particulars  of grants already sanctioned are set out below.    In  September .1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circularletters to County  Councils (except the  London  County Council) and DrainageAuthorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved,might be assisted on.fundamentally the same  conditions as those aoplicable in the      [10457]              .

Operations on these schemesceased after the 16th June, 1923.  Particulars of  grants sanctioned are shown below(see III, item 6).

The additional sums  promised in extension of existingfunds are set out below :     Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of        60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ...       ...       ...      ...      600,000    Land Drainage        ...       ...       ...       .......      170,000    Afforestation  ...       ...       ...   .    ...       ...      ...      100,000    Acceleration of Government contracts         Office of Works   ...       ...       ...           375,000        General Post Office        ...       ...           946,000                                                       -    1,321,000    It was also  then announced that guarantees under  the Trade  Facilities  ActScheme would be made available up  to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000  extra); that theExport Credits  Scheme  would be  extended if  necessary;   and that  the LocalAuthorities concerned would be  asked  to  co-operate  in  putting  in  hand  the manchester-Liverpool &quot; Road,  which would involve  an  expenditure of  about 3,000,000, half of it  from the Road Fund.    In December 1922,  the Unemployment Grants  Committee issued a  furthercircular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes... suitable forassistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of whichis normally defrayed  out of revenue and not by loan.  The conditions  under which grants may be  sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force,except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow,where clearly necessary,, a modification of the conditions  regarding the giving ofpreference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the  engagement of labour through theEmployment Exchanges.

On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a  press notice tothe effect that  forestry  grants; were available for the relief of unemployment onthe same general conditions as those  applicable to grants made during the previouswinter.  The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used  partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes in  Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ Forests.  &apos; Operations  on these  schemes ceased after the30th June, 1923.     By the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted onthe 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregatecapital amount of loans  the principal or interest  of which mav be guaranteed underthe Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from   25,000,000 to  50,000,000.
