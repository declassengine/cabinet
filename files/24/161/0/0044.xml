Note by the Chairman of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee                            of Imperial Defence.    IN preparation for the forthcoming Imperial Conference, Memoranda  on  EmpireNaval  Policy and Co-operation, prepared  by the Naval  Staff  and approved  by theStanding Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, have beenforwarded to the Governments of the Dominions and India.    The attached Memorandum  (C.I.D.  Paper No.  204-C),  dealing with  naval co-operation by the Irish Free State, which has been prepared  with a similar object,has  been under  consideration  by the Standing  Defence Sub-Committee  of  theCommittee of Imperial Defence at their  meeting on the 23rd July, 1923.    As questions of the highest political importance are raised, which the committee did not think were within their competence to deal with, I  bring the question of the wording and despatch of this paper before the Cabinet for decision.(Initialled)      S.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.

SECRET.204-C.                                               NOT FOR  PUBLICATION.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.EMPIRE  NAVAL  POLICY  AND  CO-OPERATION.                            IRISH  FREE  STATE.1.  The Naval Situation.    AS a result of the Washington  Conference  and the  abrogation of  the  Anglo-Japanese Alliance the  strategic  situation  has changed.  The status  quo agreementprecludes America from taking effective  action in the Western Pacific, and  thereforeshould Japan unfortunately become aggressive in the future, the British Empire will hethe only Power in a position to restrain  her, and the  four-Power pact between theUnited States of America, France, Japan and the  British  Empire may not save us from becoming involved in war.   The main Fleet  must therefore  be  ready to  move  to anythreatened area.  This necessitates preparations being made  for a  rapid concentration of our main Fleet in  the Far East, and  the keystone  of these preparations is thedevelopment of Singapore as a fuelling and repair  base.    In any war the lines of communication to Great Britain, the heart of the Empire,are of great importance, and it is in  this  connection that the efficient defence of thecoast  of the  Irish  Free  State,  geographically  situated  on  the  flank  of  these communications, is of such vital importance.2.  Present Position between Great Britain and the Irish Free State.    The terms of the recent Treaty provide that the Naval  defence of the Irish  FreeState  should be undertaken by  the British Government, subject to a review  of thisarrangement in 1927.  Apart from the Treaty, considerations of finance would,  in anycase, probably  preclude the immediate  development of Irish  Naval strength  to thestandard which the geographical position  and the  status of the Irish Free State in theEmpire would warrant.  But the Admiralty would  be glad to discuss future arrauge-ments with the  representatives of the Irish Free State, and hope that in the meantime the attached memorandum (C.I.D. Paper  194-C) will be of interest not only to theGovernment, but also  to  the  people  of  the Irish Free State, and that it may  help toeducate public opinion in the Irish Free  State as  to the needs of the Empire  for naval defence and the heavy burden  which this country has to bear.3.  Proposals for Go-operation.    During the period in which  the  Imperial Naval Forces are  undertaking the seadefence of the Irish Free State, their (ask will be much simplified and enhanced if theIrish  Free  State will assist as far  as possible within the limits of  the Treaty.   TheAdmiralty would be very grateful if the  Irish  Free State  would allow a representative to discuss with them details of  the various ways in which this assistance can be given.    Admiralty, July 21, 1923.P.D. 01837/iJ3.Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1923.
