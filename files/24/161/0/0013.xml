No.   13  313 (23),               REORGANISATION OB&apos; OFFICES (SCOTLAND) BILL,                Memorandum by the. Secretary for Scotland,    1,   I circulate for consideration of  the  Home Affairs   .Committee a draft of the Reorganisation of  Offices  (Scotland)Bill with a view to its early  introduction,,,    2,&apos;   This Bill is a part  of the Minor  Legal  Officials(Scotland) &amp;c Bill which formed item  11 in ListB, attachedto txie Home Affairs Committee&apos;s recommendations dated the22nd January, 1923,   The.Cabinet  subsequently  gave preliminaryapproval to List B. (CP. 61  (23))  including this item.  &apos;    3.   Difficult lies have arisen with regard  to certain ofthe proposals oi finally  intended  to be included  in the  Bill.In particular, it. ha3 become necessary to postpone for the resent the proposals-regarding the tenure&apos;  and&quot; appointment gf heriff Clerks and Procurators-Fiscal.   These  are omitted fromthe draft Bill which is appended.    4.   The following is a brief explanation  of the mainClauses of the draft Bill:-    Clause 1,&quot; The object..is  to substitute a parliamentary under-Secretaryship for Scotland for the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryship for Health  which at  present exists.   Thestatutory duties of the new tinder-Secretary will  therefore boGeneral -fe and not limited to  Board of Health questions.    Clause 2.  This is to.dispense with the requirement thatcertain&apos;members of the Board  or Health shall have specified.professional  qualifications-   so as to enable a reduction to beoade in the numbers of the Board as vacancies occur.    Clause 7).  The object  is to modify the existing statutoryarrangement under which the Chairman  of the Fishery Board forScotland holds  office  only  for a period of  five years at a(time,   The present Chairman  is a  Civil Servant and the  existinglimitation  on the tenure  creates a somewhat difficult andanomalous position.    Clauses  4-6.   The office of  Deputy Clerk  Register  has  beentacant for  several years.  The Deputy Clerk Register performedtee duties  of Rei-..is*rar-General for Scotland as well as  otherduLies.    In 1920 an  Act  was  paaaed constituting the Reg-istrar-fej.eralsb.ip as a separate office.    The late Government  thenundertook  that u.3  office of  Deputy Clerk Register would not be Ulied and that the  remaining duties  would  be assigned to existing officials.    Clause 4 provides for abolition of the office of Deputy Clerk Register and Clauses  5-3 and 12 make consequentialarrangements/
