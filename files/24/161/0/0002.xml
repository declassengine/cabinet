CABINET.                         COMMITTEE ON UNEMPLOYMENT.                              Interim Report.       I. Introductory;.                On consideration of the available information and       particularly of papers circulated by the Chairman (C.P.       276 (23)) and the Minister of Labour (CP; 268 (23)) it is clear       to the Committee that it must be contemplated that the coming       winter will be marked by a serious degree of unemployment, and       that the Government must be prepared to provide assistance &quot;towards       the initiation or acceleration of works on a scale at least as       great as was undertaken in the past financial year.       (2)      The Committee is proceeding to review and will shortly       report upon the whole position including the extent to which       assistance is still available under existing schemes, the extent       to which Government contracts can be accelerated, and the extent       to which local authorities are able and willing to submit new       schemes for assisted work under the terms of the offer approved by       the Cabinet in April last (Cabinet 21 (23)).       II. Acceleration of \?orks of Local Authorities.       (3)      Many of the industries of the Country are and have been       seriously depressed for a long time, but it is in the heavy       Engineering and Shipbuilding and allied trades that the depression       has been most marked, and the- prospects of recovery throughx       ordinary trade improvement are most obscure.                                - 1 -i 0
(4)      The relief work ordinarily provided by localauthorities&apos; can be of but little assistance to the skilledemployees of these, industries, and it Is of vital importanceto the country that the industrial asset of their skillshould he available, as little Impaired as practicable, tomeet the improvement .in trade.-vfeen.it comes.   Moreover the .local authorities in the most&apos; distressed areas have alreadyincurred heavy expenditure In the provision of relief works,and it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to take further action&apos;of this kind.(5)      In these Circumstances It appears to the Committeethat the problem of unemployment in such industries- cannotbe adequately met by local relief works.. &quot; Its solution mustlargely depend upon the stimulation of orders for material.(6)      The Gommittee. accordingly recommend that a furtheroffer of assistance by w.ay of grant should&apos;be. made to localauthorities who are -willing.to undertake works which will notbe. entirely directed to-the b-enefit of the unemployed intheir own areasbut will assist In producing employment ofa normal character in the depressed industries,1 already mentioned.     &quot;     &apos;(7)      The terns of . grant already off erred (see CP. (21) (23))through the Unemployment Grants Committee for&apos;works In thecoming winter&apos;s programme are as followsj-&apos;    &quot;1* Capital works financed by,loan.        (a) Revenue Producing Schemes.         Grants equal to 50 per cent, of the interest on loans raised by Local Authorities for a period ofnot leao t-hah ten years, in respect of expenditure on&apos;approved.

Grants equal to 65 per cent., of  the  interest    and -sinking fund charges, on loans raised  to meet    expenditure on approved schemes will be paid.by the   - State for  a period-. of one-half the&apos; term of the. loan,    subject to a maximum.of fifteen years.-&apos;   -     Works  financed otherwise than by Loan.-..            Grants will, be. paid by the State  on,, the basis   .. of 60 per  cent, of the wages bill for unemployed men    taken on for1the work&quot;. (8), .     -The recommendation of the Committee  is that theabove terms should be. Improved by the offer of grants onthe.scale applied tc the class of works described under 1(b)in. paragraph 7. for works on revenue producing schemes  whichwill assist unemployment generally by the placing of substantial orders in ..the depressed industries in additionto the development -of...capital  works In the particularlocality concerned.---. (9)      A draft circular to be issued if approved, by  theUnemployment Grants Committee  Is appended.    If the policynow recommended Is adopted, it is necessary that  its  adoptio
should be made public at the earliest possible moment, sothat the&apos;results of the circular, in securing the submission, of schemes may be approximately ascertainedbefore the end of July, and included in the  general reviewof the position which it Will be necessary to submit to theCabinet.(10)     The Committee further recommend that theUnemployment Grants Committee be authorised to use theunexhausted margin of the authority already given to them toassist works submitted to them on the new basis approved, bythe Cabinet in April last, or on that now submitted forapproval.   This marginal authority would it is understood:enable the Committee to assist,works to the total value ofsome  750,000.III. Acceleration of Works of other Undertakers.(11)     The Committee have considered whether and if sohow far assistance similar to that recommended in thepreceding section of this Report.can be extended to bodiesother than local authorities who can be stimulated to place&apos;additional orders in the very near future and. they recommendthat grants, on the same basis and the same conditions asthose recommended should be made available to       &apos;    (a) public bodies, that is, any Board, Commission,            Rating Authority, or Trustees or other body of            persons who manage or undertake work in pursuance            of statutory power,  not being a body trading for            profit j           (b) undertakings of the same nature as those&apos;            carried on by public bodies but trading for profit                Provided that in the case of undertakings            conducted by companies for private profit, the            dividends of which are not limited by Statute, the
         Unemployment Grants Committee&apos; shall he required to         impose  as- a term of the grant&apos; &apos;           (a) That the devision of the profits of the            Company by&apos; way of dividends or bonus shall be            limited in such manner and for such period            normally as the Committee may prescribe,&apos; or           (b) That the grant or such part thereof as            the  Committee may prescribe shall be repaid            on.  such conditions&quot; as may be determined by the            Committee, and that failing fulfilment of the            conditions so imposed the whole grant shall be            repayable on demand.         It would be necessary&apos; to exclude railway companies&apos;&apos;from the application of the grant,&quot; &quot;    &quot;&apos; IV.&apos; Export  Credits Scheme.(12)    &apos; The Committee&quot; concur in the recommendation of the&apos;Home&apos; Affairs Committee&apos;&quot;that the Overseas Trade  (Credit and&apos;Insurance)&apos;&apos; Act,  1920, be included ih&quot; the Schedule to&apos;the expiring Laws Continuance Bill. &quot;&quot;&apos; &apos;  -(13)     The effect of this will be to extend the period within which credits may be granted under the Act up to 8thSeptember, 1924, but it does not .affect the date by whichcredits are repayable by the 8th September, 1927.Representations  have been received urging that  this latterperiod should also be  extended so as to facilitate, the&apos; grantof  credits up to five years or so for engineering contractsThe negotiation of contracts is&apos;  a lengthy business, and it istated that it often would not be worth while for firms toenter into such negotiations unless they have more than asingle year ahead  of them.   It  Is therefore desirable thatthe period within  which credits may be granted  should beextended for not less  than two years.
           i;          .(14)      The.Committee recommend that legislation should he introduced at the earliest opportunity for (a) extending to 8th September; 1925, the period within which&apos; credits maybe granted tinder the1 Act, and (bj extending to 8th September,1930, trie period wilhin which credits so granted should be liquidated.V.

 Sir,           I  am directed by the..Unemployment Grants Committee to refer to  their circular letter.of the 18th May last regarding; schemes of work to be undertaken by local-authorities, with- State assistance, for the relief of unemployment during the coming winter.   Since the issue of that letter, His Majesty&apos;s Government have given further consideration to the prospects of employment in the coming winter.   In affording assistance to local authorities the Government desire particularly to stimulate employment of a normal character in industrial districts where the unemployment is most serious-and where the ordinary type of relief work hitherto assisted is, not appropriate for the. needs of the workpeople concerned.   The Government have, therefore, decided to offer  the following terms to assist revenue prodxicing schemes, in which a aubstantial part of the expenditure will take  the  form of orders for material which will give employment in an  industry which is  seriously affected, though  not necessarily in the area in which the work,  is to be. carried out.        ,.           For  the purpose of securing  the  acceleration of revenue producing works of  this kind,  It is proposed  that  the State  should pay for a period  of  15 years,  or  for  the period of the  loan, whichever is the  less, grants  on  the  basis of 50 per  cent, of  the  Interest on such  loans with a  currency not  less than  ten years.    It will of  course be  a condition of assistance  that  all contracts  should be  placed  in  this country.           With a view  to  the early settlement  of  the  programme of works for  the coming  winter,  I am desired by  the Committee  to request  the Authority at once  to  examine  the  possibility  of  putting  in hand  this  winter, works  of  the  kind  described
which, in other circumstances&apos;-/ the local  authority might be disposed to defer to  a later date.   Proposals  should besubmitted in rough outline as soon as.possible, and  in  any event hot later than  the end of  the  current month.   Inmaking preliminary proposals the. Authority  should  include anestimate of the expenditure&apos; to&apos;-:be incurred  and  of  the valueof:the orders to be placed.                       I am,. Sir,                          Your -obedient -Servant,  ,.
