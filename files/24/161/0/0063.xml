I N.E T. 365(25)..            &quot;  &quot;-------                       J -0          ^L-mj^lppa BETTOEN TEE NAVY AND&quot; THE AIR SiffVIOE              AND THE KSITIPI[pg reg FLEET AIS AM.            Note jjy tho Lord,  resident of tho Council,,        The Sub-Comroittoc on National and Imperial Defence referred the question of the relations between the Navy and the Air Service to a Special Sub-Committoo consisting of Lord Balfour, a former First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Weir a former Air Minister - both of them being specially conversant with the difficulties of intern-departmental relations * and Lord Peel.,  a member of the present Cabinet.  16  witnesses wore heard before the Sub-Committee and 19 memoranda were sub- mitted to it..  The consideration by the Sub-Commit toe of tho evidence like the consideration by other authorities on previous occasions have led them to a conclusion - a unanimous conclus&apos;- ion - in favour of the principle of a single Air Service,  Thoywore able to como to this conclusion because they saw their way to mooting; by suitable provisions all the valid objections which were urged -against it.    The Main Committee have  endorsed the recommendations of the Sub-Committee except that in oneparticulsr they have suggested yet one further provision tomeet the contentions submitted on behalf of the Admiralty.         The Air Service., though it must have intimates-relations-&apos;with the Armed forces at Sea and. on land,  differs in its conditions essentially from both.   On the other hand aircraftwhether they are flying above the sea or above the land are broadly speaking governed according to the same main principles,jioroovor the wholo science of air power is in a condition of rapid development.- The application therefore of experience both as to personnel and as to materiel, wherever that                                             experience....
 er?crierco  can  bo- obtained, whether at  soa  or on lend,  is  vital to success  in either  case.  We  cannot afford  to  brock up the lessons of  this&apos; experience.   Lastly it  is  clear that in certain contingencies tho  oboro-basod air  forces  and  the air  forces of tho meet may be celled upon to act together.   Such  common  action might bo very difficult without a  unity of  method in  both  Services, In this connection it may further  bo asked, if the Air  Arm is to bo divided on land onion sea, whore is the  lino  to bo drawn? Arc the shore-based aircraft which patrol tho coast and oo-oporcto  with tho fleet to belong to the flhvy or to the general Air Service?   It is clear they have the closest relations with both the soa end tho  shore  and-illustrate- tho necessity for a single Service,    Efficiency  oheroforo  prescribes common knowledge, common training, common materiel provision and a common Servioo*Economy points  in  tho  same  direction,   from this last point ofview the conclusion against  tho, duplication  of training schools and aerodromes  and building  plant  is evidenti    Yet supposing thoAir Service  to bo  split  up,  this duplication must follow becauseif training and  provision of  materiel for a  separate Eaval  air arm is to  be left&apos; in the  hands of  the Air Service, then  it  is admitted that the  friction between the Service which trainspersonnel  and produces machines  and the  Service which  uses,  thornraiaht bo&apos; serious,       y.;        for those  reasons the  conclusion of  the 3ubrCoEimittee  andof the Main Committee  that there should  bo a single Air Seryiceoust bo accepted,  unless the difficulties of detail put  forward on behalf  of the Admiralty  are  insurmountable,   Those difficultties arc important and it would  bo absurd to ignore thenu.    TheSub-Committee however  consider that by suitable previsions  they -;were able  to moot  thorn adequately,,  Thoir recommendations forthis purpose arc contained  under thirteen heads dealing withLiaison betwoen the two Services,  provision of matoriel,responsibility&apos; to Parliament, integrity of tho strength of  the                                                       fleet,,.
                                                               c5 hi 3   fleet Air Arm,  discipline  pad status of Air Officers and men   when afloat,  number and position of attached Haval officers; and   special reservation of air reconnaissance and spotting to the fiavy.   To these-the  liain Committee have added a&apos; further &apos; re commendation   permitting to attached Navel officers the retention of their   uniform which was, strongly urged on behalf of the  Admiralty,          3y those  provisions the  permeation of each  Service with   a knowledge of  tho  conditions of the other would be achieved,  and   the.administrative  difficulties dealt with without destroying the   unity of the.  Air Service.   The  Admiralty have been anxious and   proporly anxious:to maintain the efficiency of the navy and that   absolute control over  all  the, fighting eq.uipment in the fleet   which is essential  to  its  efficiency,   Tho problem is as part   of the equipment to associate with  the Soa Service another Service   different]^ armed and  differently trained.   In many respects  the   case is not unlike  the oase of  the  Marines.  T-he solution of tho   problem then  is  to  bo  found in  preserving the integrity of the   Air Service wMlefl assimilating  the  position, and status of the   fleet Air Arm when  afloat  as far as possible to the position and   status afloat of the Uoyal Marines.          Tho single Air  Service limited by the conditions described   is the recommendation  submitted to  the Cabinet, but.it is necessary - J   to add that no  solution will work whether as contended for by the   Admiralty or  by the Air Service except by tho good will and public   spirit of tho Services concerned.    Whatever this&apos;  may be, tho  do-   cision oi tho Government or of  Parliament, they have a right to   eryoct a full measure  of that good  will and public spirit from   all ranks in  the armed forces of tho Crown.
