In  pursuance  of  the  decision of the Cabinet  on the    9th  July   [Cabinet  35(23)Conclusion 6] we have again had under    consideration the question of  a  duty on  imported malting    barley.    It  will be remembered  that the Government&apos;s proposal    for  an Excise duty  on  imported malting barley, as  announced    by the Minister  of  Agriculture in the House of Commons on the    20th April, 1923, will cause a breach of commercial treaties    wife several  foreign countries.    2.     The following alternative  ways out of the difficulty    have been considered by the Committee:-         (a) modification of the commercial treaties.         (b) A fixed  Customs duty on  all imported barley,         (c) An ad valorem  Cuetorrs  duty on all imported barley,         (d) A Customs duty on  imported ma It tup; barley.ion 3.     The difficulties  of  modifying, the  treaties so as    to permit of  an  Excise duty being Imposed on Imported malting    barley are sot out  in  the  annexed memorandum (A.E.R.4I by the    Boa^d  of  Trade.   Briefly  they are that  modification would    take a long time -  probably not  less than three years  that    the  alteration would have  to be  made in  all the five treaties,    otherwise it  would  be  ineffective owing  to the operation of    the  most  favoured nation clause.   Moreover, ratification by    the  Parliaments  of  the foreign countries concerned would be    necessary in  each case.   In the circumstances we  think it le    impracticable to proceed on these lines and we have been    exploring the.possibility  of imposing a  Customs duty.
                                                           5 (J!all     4.   A Customs duty on all imported barley would be the    simplest to work administratively, especially if no rebate    were allowed in the case of barley used  for non-dutiable    purposes.  The National Partners1 Union are, however, strongly    opposed to a duty on all imported barley on the ground that    such a duty would increase the prioe of  feeding barley.  The    farmers1 Onion are also opposed to a Customs duty on all    imported barley even with a rebate in respect of barley used    for a non-dutiable purpose.  As the proposed duty ia for the    benefit of agriculturists we think it would be useless to make    a proposal to which farmers are opposed,  fle therefore oonsicier    that a duty on all imported barley would be no solution of the    difficulty.       5.   The National Farmers&apos; Onion are also opposed to an    nd valorem duty on the ground that it would-increase the price    of feeding barley, even if the duty on feeding barley were    less than that of malting barley.  It ia impossible to fix    the scale in such a way that feeding barley would be imported    duty free, as it is impossible to say definitely in some cases    when the barley is imported whether it will be used for    malting or feeding.       6,   There remains, therefore, the fourth alternative -    a Customs duty on imported malting barley.  A scheme to carry    this into effect has been put forward by the National Farmers&apos;    Union, a modified and extended form of which is set out in the    annexed memorandum [A.S.R.5] by the Board of Customs and Excise,    This scheme presents considerable administrative difficulties,    and unless the co-operation of the grain trade is secured    it will p* impossible to prevent evasion of the duty.    It has been arranged, therefore, that the Minister of    Agriculture and the Financial Seoretory to tha Treasury should    receive a deputation from the gred. n trade as early as possible*                              2.
If tho Customs scheme la unpalatable to the  grain trade,it may be necessary to setup the departmental  committee8u  gas ted in paragraph 10 of toe Cue torn a memorandum.  Inthe meantime we oonsider It imperative that  an  announco-ment on the subject should be made in the  Bouse of commons before the recess, and we recommend that the cabinet should authorise the Minister of Agriculture to give thefollowing reply on tfedneaday, the 1st August, to a question in the House of Coiaraotts;-                 Parliamentary Question.       To aak the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries when it  io the  Governments intention to impose a Atty on imported malting barley.       Since I made the ermounemont of the Qotemmonfs intention to impose an Excise duty on imported malting barley I have been advised that this course would not be possible without modification of the provisions of certaincommercial treaties with foreign countries.  TheGovernment are therefore, considering the altama-tlve method of dealing with the matter by meaneof a customs duty,    I regret that in consequenceit has not been possible to introduce legislationbefore the harvest.  The various interests concerned are being consulted, end ponding the result ofthese discussions I oan make no announcement asto the date when the Government&apos;s proposal willbe laid before Parliament.(Sl$fixed on behalf of  the Committee)   R.A,  SANDERS.
