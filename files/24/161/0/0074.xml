The dockers&apos;  strike is new confined to London:  thssituation in this area is easier and it is thought that thestrike is nearing its end:  strikers admit that,, but for reliefreceived from the Guardians, the strike would  not have lastedmore  than a fortnight.     The Communist Party of Great Britain, the Red International!of Labour Unions and the Young Communist league arereorganising their work in accordance with MOBCOW&apos;S instructions.     Secret documents quoted in this report are proof of theinterest taken.by Moscow in the industrial situation in GreatBritain.     Losovsky,  general  secretary  of  the  Red  International  ofLabour  Unions  in  Moscow has  ordered  the  British  Bureau tocompile  information &quot;for  agitation and propaganda&quot; regarding&quot;employers  organisationss  industrial and financial establishments&quot;in which Members  of Parliament  are interested:   tho Executi%reBureau  in Moscow  offers to defray all expenses  connected withthis  work.
   It is expected that the Communist Party of Great BritainBi in the near future attempt to carry out the followingIltructions laid down at the eleventh session-of the larged Sxeautive of the Communist International recentlyM in Moscow:     &quot;The  Enlarged  Executive of the CommunistInternational  calls upon the entire Party press togive  greater  attention  to the life and struggles of thetrade  unions,  to  give  the; utmost.publicity to theactivitity of  the revolutionary unions and ofoppcsi bional minorities end  factions, end to givesystematic reviews  of all organisational and politicalexperiences,-   particular attention should be givento  the  creation of  special  literature devoted to TradeUhicns  agitation  and propaganda.-   All the Communistparties must  send to the Executive Committee, regularreports -of the activities of their respective factionsin  the  Trade  Unions, so that the  experiences of one country be made the common possession of the entireInternational  Movement.     &quot;It is the duty of evory member of the CommunistInternational  to  join his union and work actively withthe Communist  fraction,  i.e., in the revolutionary  1opposition, movement.  The activity of - the communists in  the., trade unions must conform to the theses andresolutions of the  Bed  International of labour Unions.The sections, of the Communist International mustexert all  efforts to unite  all the organized workers ofthe world  under the banner  of the Hed International.&quot;   The  following letter was sent at the end of last week the members  of the Executive  Committee of the CommunistIrty:   &quot;Dear Comrade,       &quot;In view of the return of  the  delegation from  1   the  Enlarged Executive meeting  in Moscow and the&apos;                                            important/
     important decisions taken on the  position of the     British Party,  we have decided-to hare special     Executive sittings on Friday evening,  3rd August  and     all day Saturday 4th August, the  meeting to begin     on Friday, 7 o&apos;clock prompt.          &quot;A copy of the decisions token will be placed     in your hands in time for this meeting.  Meanwhile     we hope you will arrange.to keep  these dates clear     and attend.                       Yours fraternally,                              Thomas Bell,                                   Political Secretary.&quot;     Moscow has re-organised the work  of the Party and a prominent oomcvunist in Berlin &quot;trusts  that  it will resultin more aggressive and concerted policy for Great Britain.&quot;     Bob Stewart, writing from Moscow  on July 1st, sent thefollowing information to his wife:          &quot;I am still here and em not  yet able to say     when I will be home, as our business is not settled     yet...   To-narrow will determine whether I will  remain     a member of Central Comcittee or  not.   I rather     think not and honestly it has been a most unsatisfactory     conference although matters are adjusting themselves     now.  There is nothing certain yet, however, and  I am     not building up hopes as our people have all been     quarrelling...Inkpin is here now  and it is thought     may.be asked to stay-here but that also is uncertain...     Last night we were invited to a dinner given by     students of the Eastern University in honour of an.     old Nationalist Leader Mahmed. Abdullah who was present.     He has been  exiled from his native country by the     British government.  He is not a  communist but is a     very good Indian nationalist...She food was prepared     by the students and was all Indian.1.yl keep wondering     about you all at home and trust th-.t all is well.  You     at any rate will be a little better of the few weeks     pay and I hope that I will find work on return..  I     trust you get your allowance,  six weeks was the  time     allowed but I expect that you will be  paid at any     rate until my return at least.&quot;     During Stewart&quot;s absence his wife has received eweekly allowance of  2.10.0. from the  Communist Party.     Some of the British communists when abroad wouldappear to combine business with what they consider pleasure^at the expense of the Communist Party.  On July 26th WillieGallacher&apos;s/
Gallaoher&apos;s wife desoribed an evening spent by some  of theBritish delegates in Berlin on their return from Moscow.(H.B.  &quot;Freda&quot; is Freda Warr-Xangton, a British communistwho attended the Moscow conference).          &quot;I suppose hy the time you receive my letter     you&apos;11 have had a.visit from Freda, at least she said     she would call on you.  She had &quot;some  time&apos;. All     the &quot;gang1 went out for a night for the last and     earns home about 1 a.m, nice and jolly  and wakened     up the whole household.  They health.d with them a     bottle of brandy and after singing all the songs     and finishing the contents of the bottle the real.     fun started.  Freda couldn&apos;t&apos;t bite her  thumb and lay     on the floor until 5 a.m.   Then she managed to     crawl into my room.. ..I wee real glad to see the last     of the bunch.  This.was tho second night:  I was     with them the first night, bxit no never again.   I     don&apos;t know vhere all the money came from that was     spent but I&apos;m afraid the C.P. will have to pay  the     piper...&quot;     An officer at the Fort of Harwich reports that  a thorough search was made of the luggage of  the Britishrevolutionaries returning from Moscow but that nothing ofa revolutionary nature was found:  he states that the communists make uo secret of the fact that  they can getrevolutionary literature into this country  by other  meansthan by bringing it in their baggage.     The communist S.T. ?/hitehead has made  the followinginteresting admission with regard to the work of theWorkers&apos; International Russian Belief Committee inconnection with the Workers&apos; loant          &quot;The whole, notion of the loan is  for party     members to make out of it a splendid opportunity     to get in propaganda for international solidarity     to the Russian workers and it ought to be made     use of in this-sense.&quot;     Helen Crawfurd, secretary of the workers&apos;International  Russian Relief British Joint  Labour AidCommittee, has applied to Berlin for the film ofVoroveky&apos;s funeral and the film &quot;dealing with Hew Russia&quot;as the Committee &quot;is anxious to have them as soon as                                            possible /
                               a. 4 &quot;*possible with a view to arranging for their use throughoutBritain in our winter session.&apos;1    . At a meeting of the West London Local party committee held on July 26th the organising secretary reported that he intended to try to arrange 32 meetings weekly in the  area between aouthall end Kensington:   specimen copies  of communist literature are to be obtained  from headquarters and the leaders of the south Hammersmith. Horth Hammersmith,Kensington, Ohiswlok, Fulham, Baling and Souths!3 groiipshave been instructed to concentrate on a hoxise to housecanvass to increase tho sales of &quot;The porkers&apos; Weekly&quot;:addresses of factories in these districts are to be collected and unemployed members of the  Party have  been instructed to sell the paper and hold meetings in theneighbourhood of factories during the luncheon hour.    It is.not without interest to note how Moscow&apos;s instructions regarding the Labour Party, Trades Councils and Co-operative Societies are carried out by the west London Local  party Committee:  of the 31 members 14 are members of the Labour Party,  6 are on Trades Councils and 9 are members  of Co-operative. Societies.      There would at present  appear to be a decrease In communist activity in certain areas:  the Chief  Constable  of Liverpool  informs me th^t group meetings are held  very irregularly and that some of the Area committees have been abandonsd.  The Scottish  organiser  of&apos; the Communist Party  sports that:           &quot;Tilings  are  very  very quiet here,  due  of course      to the holidays and  summer weather. The  slackness      however is periodic  and will begin to disappear in      August.   There  is nothing  doing  at present  and we&apos;11      simply have to  get  ready making  preparations  for the      no:ct  big  Push this  Winter.&quot;
                           of 5 oWSSSRJ..      The resumption  of work hy Hull dockers on July 30th seems to have had some effect on London dockers.  The situation in Lonflon  is  e a s i e r  ao.fi  there is a general feeling that the strike is Bearing its end.   At present the position at Tilbury is practically normal,      A very reliable correspondent has furnished the following report:-          &quot;The strike -has developed purely into a      strike against-the recognised leaders of the      Transport Workers and other unions and is      undoubtedly run by those who think they have a      chance of taking their places if they are outed.      The greater proportion of those who attend the      meetings are the unemployed and the communists      themselves very freely, state that funds are      forthcoming from Russia but I have not been able      to confirm this report beyond the fact that some      of the extremist labourers in the Surrey Docks      are undoubtedly spending a gooc; deal more money      than they obtain either from their work or from the      Relieving Officer.        .  &quot;A sign of the weakness of&apos; the strike is the      fact that the strike leaders are now resorting to      very obvious misstatements to encourage their      followers.  These statements are to the effect      that the employers are recognising the strike      leaders and that negotiations have been commenced      again.  A notice has been posted at poplar Town      Hall to the effect that 1,700 Permanent men have      come out in the London and St, Katharine Docks, the      actual fact being that about 80 have come out.  As      the strike leaders are sufficiently intelligent      to know that statements of this nature can only      be effective for a very short time before they are      found out, it is obvious that they ere beginning to      doubt their powers of keeping the men out much      longer.          &quot;The most popular form of intimidation      resorted to by the strikers is the playing of Dead      Marches by bands outside the houses of non strikers...      This is certainly a form of intimidation that seems      to strike a great terror in the hearts of the      families of the non strikers.&quot;      The strikers frankly admit,  that but for grants from the Guardians the strike would not have lasted more than a fortnight:  a married striker with 6 children told one
his pay averaged about  2^10.0. per week,  but at present he was receiving from the Guardians&apos; Relieving Officerrelief in money and kind to She value of  3.10.0. perweek.     On July 25th about 300 unemployed communists and afew dockers marched from lotherhithe Tunnel to theSouthwark and Camberwell Boards of Guarditns in order to demand the same scale of relief for the dock strikers,as is paid to the unemployed.   The marchers met with nosuccess at souths?ark but the Guardians at  Csrfoerwellpromised to receive a deputation of 5 Cemberwell dockers attheir next meeting on August 9th.     The extremists are using every effort to keep the strikers solid and ere advising the men not to return towork until the employers agree to the old  rates of pay andpromise that no reductions will be made in the nearfuture.  It is reported, however, that many dockers aredesirous of returning to work and are only waiting for a lead.  At a meeting held on July 27th in the vicinity ofthe King George 7 Dock, Goldsmith and Tamer admitted, whenquestioned by a port of London Authorifcy1a clerk, that, ifthe  strikers gave Bevin a hearing, he would no doubt talkthem round and they would go back to work.     On July 23th Garner of the Unofficial Strike Committeestated to an audience of about 330, that he wanted to get20 strikers to go to the Head Offices of the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union for the purpose of taking possessionin order to prevent Bevin,and Gosling communieating withthe employers and to prevent &quot;dope&quot; massages being sent tothe provincial dockers:   Garner added that if 20 men couldbe got he would see that they were provided with plenty of food whilst in possession of the offices.

     At a meeting held In the Devonshire Road, CustomHouse, on July 31st, Jimmy Valentine stated that:          &quot;I have come here to appeal to you lor men     to picket Dundee Wharf as man are going to work     there with impunity.  I am on strike from there     hut before I left I diso canoetad the elentric     fuses and messed the power plant up so that thsy     cannot get electric power for the cranes When they     want to make a start and this also affects the     power at the River Plata Wharf as.their power     comes through the. same plant.&quot;     The necessary steps have ha en taken in connectionwith the statement made by Valentine as to his tamperingwith the electric plant, which tap pears to be true.     At a meeting held in Backton Road on the same fiisyDavid Hunter advocated a system of picketing furtheraway from th* docks as he considered it advisable tomeet the men going to work and see that they did not getthere.     On July 89th a mass demonstration of between 1,500 -2,000 dockers and supporters was held in Hyde Park:  the speeches made were fairly moderate in tone: - Bevln,Gosling, Tillett and Williams, however, were vigorouslydenounced as &quot;traitors&quot; and sarcastic comments were madsregarding their salaries.  A body of German seamen present at the meeting received an enthusiastic welcome.     In Ho, 4. of the &quot;dockers&apos; strike edition&quot; of &quot;TheWorkers&apos; Weekly&quot; dated July 28th (published, previous tothe resumption of work in Hull) the Communist Partydeclares that:            &quot;gmig ,  STRIKE   MUST   KB   WON              CAPITALISTS PRAISJJ &apos;I AD)JRS&apos;             BUT RAffll AMD FILT&apos;.

    Workers&apos; Union have  this  morning issued a    manifesto begging  the Dockers to return to work,    ana declaring that this will be the last reduction    tha union will tolerate.   It1a the same old tale,    it1s been going on for tha last two years, and the    offioials are always willing to be brave and fight    to-morrow, but nevor ready to fight to-day.          &quot;By subterfuge  and intrigue, by ounning tactios    and back-handed methods,  the official loaders of    the Transport and  General workers&apos; Union split the    ranks  and got the  Dockers back to work at all ports    except London and  Hull.    !?or this action they have    been applauded by  all the capitalists.  It ia a    strange sight.  The  leaders being applauded by men,    who never in their lives  had less than 10s. to spend    on any single meal,  and the same leaders being    repudiated by 60,000 workers, who are fighting    against having to  try and  keep themselves and their    families on 10s. a day.          &quot;The Dockers  in London and Hull are making a    magnificent stand, but have they any contact with    each  other?  Have  they a  common policy and a common    programme?        &quot;In both ports,  the employers have definitely    refused to open up negotiations with tha unofficial    strike committees.          &quot;The Communist  Party has all through the strike    warned the Bookers and their unofficial leaders of    tho danger of isolating themselves.  The employers    oan be smashed when  the workers are united,&apos;  The    reply  to the employers&apos; united front must be the    workers&apos; united front.  We again urge the Doctors   - and their Strike Committee to pursue a bolder and    more  aggressive policy.   Strikes are only won when    there  is an effective programme around which you oan    rally  all sections of the workers and get them to     join  the ranks of  the strikers.          &quot;Below we print a programme, whioh can unite     all sections of dock workers, and give every man    something definite and practical to work on.          &quot;Send your delegates to Hull, Liverpool, Cardiff,    Southampton, and all other ports.. submit this    programme to the Lockers  there.  Hold meetings outside    every  garage, tramway depot and railway goods yard in    London.&apos;          &quot;Organise your  pickets to stop ail blacklegging.    Organise processions and  demonstrations.  Let the    people see you are in earnest and mean to fight till    victory is yours.          &quot;This strike  must be won.  It can be won, if you    adopt  our Programme.&quot;Their  programme is that quoted In Report No. 214.Their/
     Their &quot;Stop Press&quot; now, howevor, contains thofo31owing paragraph:-          &quot;We regret tht,t owing to printing and financial     difficulties, we are not able to continue printing     this Edition every day.  In the case of any     developments in the Strike, we shall by one way or     another contrive to come out with another Special     Edition.   We thank all those who have helped in     getting the Paper distributed.&quot;     &quot;The New Charter&quot;, the organ of tha nationalUnemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement, has devoted most ofthe space in its last two ieeuea to the dockers&apos; strike on lines &quot;similar to those adopted by the Communist party:  Itmay here be recalled that Hannington, the organiser of thiemovement, was present at  meetings of the EnlargedExecutive of the Comintern held in Mosoow in June.     On July 18th the Manhetton branch of the MarineTransport Workers! Industrial Union  510, New York, sent the following letter to Sturrook, who was at th.,t timaseoretary of the Unofficial strike Committee:     &quot;ffe How-workers,          &quot;In acting on your oablegrcm sent to Chicago     which was circulated in all American seaports;&apos; we     decided at the New York Branch of the M.T.W.I.U.,     S10 of the I.W.W. to have&apos;a sufficient number of     leaflets printed to distribute among the marine     transport workers, urging them to boycott all     English merchant vessels until such time as we may     hear from you.          &quot;As your strike is a so-oalled &quot;outlaw&apos; strike,     we are afraid that you will receive very little     support from the International Longshoremen         ;     Association, which, being a part of tha American     Federation of Labour, is very conservative.          &quot;The I.W.W. will do all in its power to further     the cause of the striking fellow workers in England.     At the same time we take this opportunity to advise     them to organise industrially so as more effectively     to oorAbat the shipowners.          &quot;Wishing you a victorious outcome of your     strike, we remain              Yours for One Big International Industrial                      Union of all Wage workers.&quot;
RED INTERN ATI ONAL Of LABOUR UNIONS &amp;. MEMBERS &apos; 0? PARLiqiMT      On July 18 th, A. Losovsky,  general secretary of tha Red International of labour Unions sent to the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions a oopy  of the following circular issued to &quot;all^ organisations affiliated to the Red International of Labour Unions&quot;?      &quot;Lear Comrades,           &quot;In our struggle against the bourgeoisie.,  we      have net sufficiently utilised the connections      existing between the legislative institutions and the      employers&apos; organisations,,  industrial and financial      establishments*  Yet the knowledge of the exact      character cf each legislative body,  of the property      standing of the members of parliament and their      personal dependence upon the corporations, presents a      wealth of material  for agitation and propaganda  It      is necsssary to make such investigations.  It would      suffice to look through the parliamentary and      Industrial year books to establish who of tho M*.?B.      are connected with any psrtidxiar branch of industry.      There are, in some  countries, statistical data on the      social status of the members of parliament,  but these      are too general.  The fact that an MoP.  is a merchant (?)      or industrialist tells the worker very little.   If  we      were ab&apos;ie to make up special tables for  the&apos; lower      and upper bouses,  showing that so many M.PSs are      connected with the  various railway coi^anies,  that  so      many Benatove represent the ooal nagoates? that so      many cf the democratic prattlers are hirelings of the      gas,  shipping,  metal, chemical and other trusts;  and      if we were able to  show the capital of each one of      these trusts,  end widely publish this data throughout      the country, we would expose all the democratic,      constitutional  illusions,  which,  unfortunately,  still      have a hold upon the workers.   The Executive Bureau      rsquests your serious attention to this  question.      Capable and reliable persons should  be assigned to      collect the necessary material.   In case of lack  of      funds for this work, tha Executive Bureau is ready  to      defray all expenses connected with the work of      compiling and  filing this  information.   The Importance      of such an investigation need  hardly be  emphasised.      When we collect all this information (though the      gentlemen in parliament thoroughly disguise their      organic connections with the vested  interests),  and      analyse,  from this  point of view,  the British      parliament, the moat liberal parliament  in tha  world,     ,tha Prenoh Chamber  of Deputies and  Senate,  the      American Congress, the democratic parliament of  Germany,      etc.,  we shall see  the sooial  composition of the      present democracies.   We shall request the All-      Russian Central Council of Trade  Unions  to present      similar data on the legislative  bodies of soviet  Russia.      Such a comparison would be instructive,  not  only to  the
         backward workers, but even  to the anarchist demagogues.         We hope you will take up  this matter without delay,         fully  rekognising the tremedous agitational importance         of such a  study.                             fraternally yours,                               General seoretary  of the R.I.I.U.                                     A. losovsky.&quot;THE HBP, INTERNATIONAL OP LABOUR UHIOHS         Moscow&apos;s orders regarding the re-organisation of the     British Bureau  of  the Red International  of Labour Unions     are now being enforced.  Willie  Gallacher has taken over     his work on the Bureau tmd has instructed the Executive     members to  be present at &quot;the  first meeting of the new     body&quot;  on August 1st where the  following  agenda will be     discussed:         &quot;(1)   Report from  Profirfcern Delegates.

     unstttlei, * regular reports and information on     the British labour Movement to the Executive Bureau.     We consider suoh regular reports of exoeptional     importance and we would like to have, in addition to     the general reports on your activity, most     comprehensive reports on work in the three basic     industries, the transport, metal and raining     industries.  We are particularly interested in the :     aetails of your activities in preparation to the     Trade Union CongresB at Plymouth.  It is also     desirable that you engage most vigorously in the     work of creating a financial basis for the entire     Left Wing movement.  The Executive Bureau hopes     that the new Bureau will be successful in     achieving tangible results in the organisation of     the Left wing,  I wish to point out that the recent    &quot; debate on socialism in the House of Commons, offers     e wealth of material for the exposition of the     reformist leaders of the Labour P;:rty ana trade     unions^  I am also under the impression that you     ha\&apos;e not sufficiently utilised the pamphlet &quot;Capital     ana Parliament&quot;, published by the Research Department     which gives most valuable data on the wealth, of the     members of Parliament and House of lords.  By the way     will you kindly request Comrade Page jsrnot to     provide us with additional information on the     connections between the British politicians and the     Industrial ana Banking houses.&quot;     It is obvious that the coffers of the British Bureauhave recently been replenished:  this week a subsidy of 10 was sent by the Bureau to &quot;The Worker&quot; in place of theusual  6 whioh was scrapea -together ?/ith muoh difficultybefore the recent visit of the Red International ofLabour Unions delegates to Moeoow.     The following is un extract from one of many similarletters recently sent to the offices of &quot;The Worker&quot;:in connection with payment for copies of that paper:          &quot;Re yours of 18th inst. asking me for remit     on account enclosed.  I should  like to inform you     that on June 28th I sent two pe0. for 15/- each     making 30/- in all to J*H. Campbell, 36,  Montrose     Street,  Glasgow.  This would clear my account,  but     in not having a reoeipt for seme I again wrote  to     Campbell on July 16th asking for a reoeipt,  but I     have not yet had a reply.&quot;     A mass of correspondence is passing between the berlin 3ureau of the Red International of Labour Unionsend the British.Bureau, as will be seen from someextracts taken from this correspondence.

     &quot;But in spite of the great importance of formingthat front, we have done well-nigh nothing towardsrealizing it.  The miners are as before fightingseparately and isolated from the workers of otherindustries, devoured and utterly ruined by national and oiganlsatory boundaries.  The reformist leaders ofthe Amsterdam MinerB&apos; Federations are as beforeweakening the mining rank and file&apos;s determination tofight.  Our direct communications with the miners inother countries are still incomplete, and consequently,the struggle against the splitting activity of one partof the reformists is poor.     &quot;All that occasions a greet weakness for theminers further struggles.  The movements of the miners in the separate countries, as in Alsaoo-Lorraine,Upper bilesla, and in England, hava boon crushed or have had but petty successes, as in Prance and onthe Ruhr, and our situation will probably grow far more serious in the next future.  All the defeatsnamed have carried the spirit of disruption into the mine workers&apos; ranks, and have, at the same time,reinforced the organised mine-capitalism throughoutthe world.  The renewed attacks of the latter will, wefear, be of far sadder consequences for the mining-class.     &quot;It&apos;s high time to be preparing for the mortalcombat inevitable with the world&apos;e capitalism.Therefore raise the rank and file&apos;s classconsciousness and moke th.;m amalgamate,     &quot;We must draw all miners organised or unorganisedto our side, as well as gain the support of all trade-organisations.  Make use of all means for forming theunited front in spite of all foes and splitters.     On July 5th tho Berlin Bureau of the Bed  Internationalof labour $lions forwarder on behalf of the &quot;InternationalsCommittee of Propaganda of Revolutionary Miners&quot; a copy of a circular addressed to &quot;All Minorities and independentunions of miners tiffilleted to the Had International of labourUnions&quot;:  its text is as follows:          &quot;Our chief task at present in the $information of a     United fighting front of the miners of the woria.     The international amalgamation of mine o&amp;pitalists must     be everywhere opposed by a closely jointed front.     y-     That&apos;3 our taeX  that1a the revolutionary miners&apos;     chief demand, that was decided by the Prancfort     conference,  by the May full session of our International     Committee of propaganda end by the  late  full session     of the lM.lV.U&apos;s. executive.
K Q QDOB (a)    Instalment  of  regular  lively communications       between  the revolutionary  organisations and the       rank and  file. (b)    Foundation  of  a big militant funds  for supporting       fighting miners in all the world. (o)    Campaign against all  antagonists  and  splitters       of the united  front.     &quot;Comrades,  with  the end  of realizing  the above mentioned tasks,  -please to  pay all your attention to the  following  pr cot leal measures: . 1. -  To onoe again demand  of tho  reformist leaders in eaoh country to support  the united front, to  oppose all  obstruction and  agitation against the communists and  partisans  of  the  R.I.L.U., and,  together with our comrades,  to form a  uniform federation  of miners in-their country.  We believe  the said  union possible and  highly desirable  for balancing the  rights of all workers in fighting  for bettor conditions of life. So    To impose upon  the separate works  as well  as local and district organisations of  miners  to form brotherhoods;.  i.e.f  to unite the miners of  the  work, town or district  in  question with workers of other industries, thus  forming committees  of  action for jointly struggling, for an amelioration  of their material  end legal position. Such brotherhoods are especially necessary in the border territories,  where the  problem of emigration,  national  differences, religions a^d  other  prepossessions are  acute, as e.g. in Alsace-Lorraine,  Silesia, France,  Cheoo-Slovakia, Germany,  Poland,  etc. 3*    To request the  national organisations  to impose upon the International of Miners to  form  a  committee of action together with  tha Russian and  other  miners&apos; unions not belonging to the Amsterdam International. The  said committee is to act for a successful fight for  ameliorating  the miners&apos; material and legal position, against fascism,  against war, for ths rekognition, and  admission  of the Russian labour unions, and  for solidarity during the miners&apos; strikes in the separate countries. 4.    Independent  of  tho possible union  in one federation throughout all countries,  to immediately display an&quot;extensive  campaign for forming a militant funds according to the decision  of the  rt, 1.1.U.&apos;s exeoutive. The said  funds  will  be formed of deductions, collections,  and sale of propaganda- stamps in the  separate^ organisations, and will  be concentrated in the  national oentres of the revolutionary  organisations.  Tho letter will  give an account to the I.CP., tlu-t will also concentrate the battle-funds for  the exclusive purpose  of aiding militant rainars. 5.    To instel a  regular service of  information for the I.C.P. by submitting accounts,&quot;reports&apos;on &quot;activity.sessions/
- 15 -On/ sessions&apos;  reoorda,  and  by  sending material  on  the revolutionary organisatory activity.   The 1,0.3?* is to  bo duly informed,  of all problems  growing  aoute. That is tho basic condition for guaranteeing  a strict unity of action in fighting for the united  front of the world miners.      &quot;All  measures mentioned  above are of the  most imminent urgency and  importance,   ifo  time may be lost in  carrying them out.  We  must be prepared  to  realise the demands,  if necessary,  against the reformist leaders&apos; wills,  but with the&quot;help and active participation of the miners&apos;  rank and file.   These latter must be drawn to the task,  and mutt exercise  a pressure upon their former leaders  opposed to  that move.  A moat extensive  propaganda is necessary, combined with conferences,  councils,  public meetings with the miners&apos; active participation.      &quot;Pay  much attention to holding and  organising different  conferences and  discussions with  tho reformist  organisation  for dealing with separate questions  of cur struggle^  That must be well  prepared so  that the reformist organisations will be foriped to act together with us.  The.Berlin conference  of transport workers in May is an instance of such a conference, and the reformists have there  been forced to support the  . rank and file&apos;s revolutionary demands,      &quot;The  resolutions of the  said conference  are of a special importance for  our whole further activity, that is why they must be made widely  popular,   We must insist upon a similar conference of miners  being called. As  the right wing of the International Federation of   - Transport-Workers is retreating, and  is attempting to  make nought the Berlin  decisions carried by the rank and file, it is our business to  publioly brand the Amsterdam schemes everywhere and  at all times - The materials for that purpose (resolutions) are  enclosed. We  especially point out the 2nd resolution  of the Amsterdamers containing attacks upon  the Profintern, Soviet-Russia and the Berlin  conference,      &quot;The  local presses are to be widely utilized for the campaign^  Bon&apos;t forget to send us a copy each of  - all your matter propagandists and otherwises  eo that  - we  are enabled not only to pursue the oampaign&apos;;s development in all countries, but also to help you on the fields of propaganda and  organisation by publications in the world&apos;s press.               With brotherly  greetings,          International  Committee of propaganda of                     Revolutionary Miners,&quot;H.3.   A word toward popularising the Berlin conference:      &quot;Do all to flood tho  Miners&quot; International and the national centres of the .jnsterdam trade unions with protests against the non-fulfilment of the  obligations undertaken&apos;by the Amsterdamers in the Berlin conference.   Bombard and  bewilder them with  resolutions and decisions of big mass-meet lags, conferences, etc, according to propositions  1,  2, 3 of  the present circular.  &quot; Begin that work right now, and make it take effect in 2 or 3 weeks.&quot;
