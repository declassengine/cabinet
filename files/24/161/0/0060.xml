CABINET.mIMPERIAL  ECONOMIC CONFERENCE (DOCUMENTS)  COMMITTEE.REPORT.               (As approved by Cabinet 44 (23), Conclusion 9.*)Composition of Committee and  Terms of Reference.    1. IN pursuance of Cabinet  25 (23) Conclusion 3, the following Committee was constituted for the purpose of sanctioning the transmission to the  Dominions andIndia of documents prepared  for the Economic Conference:        The Secretary of State for the Colonies (in the Chair),       The Secretary of State  for India,       The President of the Board of Trade,       The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,               with       Mr. R. B. Howorth and       Mr.. E. R. Eddison as Joint Secretaries.    2  By  Cabinet 32 (23)  Conclusion 5, the  Cabinet  agreed  to  extend theCommittee&apos;s Terms of Reference so as  to authorise  the  Committee to  make recommendations to the Cabinet in regard to the documents under consideration.    3. The First Lord of the Admiralty, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade, and Departmentalrepresentatives have attended meetings of the Committee when questions of special interest have been under consideration.    4. The Committee  have  held three Meetings  and have carefully consideredMemoranda, submitted  to them by an Inter-Departmental  Committee  and  also by various  Departments.   A list  of the Memoranda in  question is contained inAppendix I of this Report.   The Committee do not consider that at the  present stage it is necessary to circulate the documents in question to the Cabinet, but steps are being taken to  print those  documents  which  will be required  for the use ofMinisters  at the Economic Conference, and copies of the  prints will  be availablelater, if required.    5. In the  following paragraphs  the Committee make recommendations to theCabinet on various questions which have arisen in the course of their deliberations,indicating briefly their  reason for a particular recommendation.Imperial Preference.    6. In considering this subject the Committee have had before them, in additionto the large Memorandum  by the Inter-Departmental Committee (I.E.C. &quot;B&quot;Series I)  a letter  from the  First Lord of the Admiralty  commenting on that memorandum and making certain further suggestions (I.E.C. &quot; B&quot; Series XIII);detailed memoranda prepared by  the Board of Trade and the Customs dealing withparticular topics, viz.,  Currants (I.E.C. &quot;B&quot; Series XI),  Preserved Fruit andCanned Fish (I.E.C. &quot; B &quot;  Series X), and Tobacco (I.E.C. &quot;B *&apos;  Series XII andXIIA); and a memorandum on Stamp Duties and Income Tax (I.E.C. &quot; B &quot; SeriesXVIIl) prepared by the Inter-Departmental Committee in consultation with theBoard of Inland Revenue.          * For the modifications made by the Cabinet, see notes on pp. 2, 3, 8 and 10.

                                        2                                     -iMinisterial  Pledges.     7. At the outset, the attention of the Committee was  specially drawn to the pledge given by the late Prime Minister not to make any fundamental change in theBritish  fiscal&quot; system  during  the present  Parliament,  and  to  the  suggestedinterpretation of this pledge that no new protective duty should be imposed unless aspecial case could be made out for exceptional treatment, and that preference should therefore continue to be incidental to the duties primarily imposed either for revenueor for protection so limited.  It was suggested that the Ministerial pledge did hotpreclude  the  grant of an increased preference,  or the  institution of a new dutyincluding preference on goods  in  the same category as goods  already subject topreference; that in any case the pledge must be interpreted liberally, having regardto the very valuable rebates allowed by the Dominion Governments, and particularly by Australia, and to the slight financial benefits accruing to the Dominions from theexisting preferences.  It was also suggested  that whatever further concessions weremade should be granted to the whole Empire, and should not be the subject of separateDominion agreements.     8. The Committee recommend      (1.)  That the line to be  taken  should be  that in order  to  encourage the           development of Empire settlement  and  the  granting  of  Dominion           preference to British goods, as well as  with a view to the alleviation of           unemployment at home, the British Government  should endeavour to,           give as  extensive further preferences as may be possible without violation           of the Ministerial pledges.     (2.)  That any  concession made  should be granted generally to the whole Empire,           and should not be  the subject of separate Dominion agreements.!     (3.)  That a total  remission of the duty on  certain Empire products is not           inconsistent with  the Ministerial pledges.     (4.)  That the  imposition of any  new  or  increased  duty on  food  should be           conditional on an adjustment being made in  respect of other duties on           food, so as to secure that food taxation should not be increased in the           aggregate.     9. The following paragraphs deal with  the particular extensions of preferenceor imposition of new duties which the Committee have had  under consideration.For convenience, a brief summary of the Committee&apos;s recommendations in favour ofnew or increased preferences is  given in Appendix II.                                                                \\Dried Fruits.     10.  Australia  is  the Dominion  most  concerned in  this  matter,  and it  isunderstood that she will probably ask that total remission of duty should be accordedin respect of  dried fruits of Empire production, and,  further,  that the present rateof duty  (10s. Gd. per cwt.) on raisins and prunes should be  extended to currants.She will  also probably suggest that the duty of 10s. M. per cwt. should be appliedto certain classes of dried-fruits which are at present duty free, e.g., dried peachesand apples.     11.  As regards currants, a difficulty arises.   To raise the duty on currants above2s. per cwt.  would require a modification in the present Anglo-Greek Convention,which, however, has already  been denounced by  the Greek Government and is onlycontinued by an arrangement  terminable by three months&apos; notice.   The  ForeignOffice are apprehensive of the political effect of proposing such  a modification in viewof the great dependence of Greece on  the export of currants, and there may also be some anxiety in Lancashire  as to the possible loss of  trade advantages enjoyed byBritish cotton and other goods in the  Greek market.   On the  other hand, our tradewith Greece is trifling compared with our trade  with  Australia, and the Committeedo not feel it possible politically to return a purely negative answer, to the Australiandemand simply on  the ground of our interest in Greek trade.   At the same time,  theevidence  before  them leads them to  doubt if  the grant  of that  demand would inpractice be of much advantage to Australia or disadvantage to Greece, which has apractical monopoly of the best class of currants.    * The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that the question of improving and tuningup the organisation of the Dominions in London and overseas in connection with overseas settlement mbeen dealt with in a separate memorandum which had been forwarded to the Dominions, and that he proposed.shortly after the opening of the Imperial Economic Conference, to refer ihe  question to a special Sub&quot;Committee of the Conference.    t -A-n exception to this general rule will  be found in the case of tobacco, see paragraph 21 below.
                                                                            5 Id    12. The Committee recommend         That  in the event of the question of an increased preference on Currants        being raised at  the  imperial Economic Conference,  the  representatives  of        His Majesty&apos;s  Government should have a  free  hand  to  deal with the        Australian demand  on its merits, within the limits  of the proposal which        has been under consideration by the Committee^ namely,  an increase of the        duty on foreign  Currants from 2s. to a  rate not exceeding 10s. 6^. per cwt.,        with complete exemption for Empire Currants.  They should, at the same        time,  be requested  to bear in mind  the  importance  of so  timing  and        presenting any consequential proposals to Greece as to minimise the political        and economic disadvantages apprehended by the Foreign  Office.*    13. As regards other dried fruits, the Committee recommend     (a.) That an extension of the existing tariff rate to certain classes of dried fruits          which are at present duty free would not  be inconsistent with Ministerial          pledges, and should be conceded if pressed for by the Dominions.    (b.) That dried fruits of Empire production should be admitted free of duty to          Great Britain.Preserved  Fruits and Jams.   114. Briefly, the present  situation is that  dried or preserved  fruits imported(other than raisins, currants and figs, and all kinds of plums) are duty free in the -United Kingdom, but when preserved in sugar  (e.g., fruits in syrup:, jam, &amp;c.) are changed with duty on the sugar  content.  The  proposal  is  to  impose a duty  onpreserved fruits as such  (in addition to the existing duty on  sugar, if any, used  inpreserving), and to exempt Empire fruits altogether  from the new duty so imposed.!    15. The Committee considered whether the new duty should be imposed on  all foreign fruit, or whether it should not rather be confined to those  sorts in which theDominions are interested.  The former alternative would, it was  urged, have theadvantage of giving an immediate preference to all Dominion fruit  products, andthus would  encourage Dominion growers to compete with  the foreigner in fruitswhich at present they do not produce.    16. On the other hand, it was represented that  it would be easier-to defend theimposition of a duty and the grant of a preference in respect of items specially askedfor by  the Dominions, and that there would  be  no difficulty in adding  items to the.preference list hereafter should any Dominion wish for such an addition. Moreover,the Committee felt that fruits (such as dates) which form  a cheap, staple article  offood  should be exempt from the duty.  Fruit pulp should also be exempt, as it is araw material for the British jam manufacturer.    17. The Committee recommend, after careful consideration     (1.) That  authority  should be given to the representatives  of His Majesty&apos;s          Government at the Imperial Economic Conference  to propose           (a.) That a duty of 5s.  per cwt., in addition to the  existing duty on sugar                 (if any) used in preserving, should be imposed on foreign preserved                apples, pears, pineapples, peaches, apricots and nectarines.  Other                 preserved fruits could be added to the  list hereafter should the                Dominions so wish.          (b.) That Empire-preserved fruits should be exempt from this new duty.    (2.) That no proposal should be entertained for extending  the duty to fruit pulp.    Note. It is estimated that the duty on the fruits specified would  produce about           250,000  a year.Sugar.    18. The position is, briefly, that the existing preference on sugar is one-sixth,  or about \d. a lb., and there is  a strong demand for an increase of  this preference  toone-third, and for its consolidation for a period of years.  It is understood that  bothAustralia and  South Africa  are likely  to raise  the  question at the Conference, butthe main benefit of an increase in the preference on  sugar would  doubtless accrue  to   *  The President of the Board of Trade has undertaken  to consider and do his best to arrange that inthe event of an increased duty  on currants being agreed to at llie Imperial Conference, some provision should be made to soften the effect of this measure in Greece, either by postponing the operation of  theincrease for a year or two  (which need not deter the growers in  Australia from planting fresh vines) orotherwise,   t The position with regard  to these articles is fully discussed in I.E.C. (&quot; B&quot; series) I (pp. 15-17) andI.E.O. (&quot;B&quot; series) X.       [10423]                                                         B  2
Crown Colonies-Mauritius and the West Indies.  The doubling of the prefererJwould involve a loss to the Exchequer of about  2,200,000 per annum (a large pro.portion of which would  in  effect represent  a. free  gift  to  the sugar-growers ofMauritius), and the adoption of such a proposal would meet  with great opposition from the British refiners.     19. The  Committee have had under consideration the practicability of giving anundertaking  that the existing preference should be maintained  for,  say, ten yearsand also the  practicability of a  further undertaking that,  for a period of tenyearjas from January 1926, the preference should be increased to Id. per lb.  It was repre-sented  to  them  that  an  undertaking to  give  a preference  of Id.  per lb. onEmpire-grown sugar for a period of ten years would undoubtedly encourage extensivedevelopment  in the West Indies and elsewhere, and that the resulting demand formachinery, &amp;c,  would help  unemployment at home.  The Committee understand,however, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is quite unable to assent to any increasein the existing rate of preference on sugar.  The Treasury  point out that the cost of the  proposal would be very heavy, and that if adopted the scheme would make it moredifficult than ever to reduce the present high sugar duty.     20. After weighing the matter carefully, the Committee recommend          That the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the  Imperial         Economic Conference should be authorised to propose that a preference of         an amount  not less than the present amount, viz., approximately \d. alb.,         should be given for a period of ten years on all Empire sugar imported into         Great Britain.Tobacco.     21. The  existing preference on  tobacco amounts to about one-sixth of the duty,and if  this  were increased  to one-third the cost  to the  Exchequer would be 600,000 per annum in the first year, with a tendency to increase as cultivation withinthe Empire developed.     22. The results of the inquiries recorded in I.E.C. &quot;B &quot; Series XII, indicate thatwhile the Imperial Tobacco Company and the other firms consulted are not actuallyhostile to an increase of the existing preference, they are agreed that such an increase would tend to stimulate the production of inferior tobacco, and  that what is reallyneeded is a considerable improvement in the quality and in the  curing and grading of the  raw material.  On the other hand, it must be remembered that the Unionof South Africa  will certainly  press for increased preference,  and  the Committeethink it most desirable, if possible, to meet South African views in the matter.     23. The  existing preference on Empire-grown, tobacco  is  already large (a,probably 70 per cent, ad valorem), and it may be argued that  if,  with their existingadvantages, the Dominions cannot compete, it is improbable  that  they ever will beable to  compete.    The loss  of  revenue would be  very  substantial if the  existingpreference  were increased for the Empire as a whole  (even if the increase were only to  one-quarter  instead of to one-third);  and in this  connection attention maybe drawn to  the very large tobacco  production of India, a country which gives nopreference  to Empire goods,   in view of these considerations, the Committee have thought it  necessary to consider  whether ft would not be desirable to exclude india from any general increase of the  tobacco preference.     24. The  Secretary of State  for  India accordingly consulted confidentially withthe Government of India on this point, and the result of his inquiries was to indicatethat, if it were decided to limit the proposed increase of preference to Empire-growntobacco other than tobacco grown in India, there seemed no  reason to suppose that, inthe circumstances, any great exception would be taken to such a  proposal by indian opinion.     25. There is no doubt great  weight to be attached to the argument that, notwithstanding the result of the Secretary of State&apos;s inquiries, it is preferable, on broagrounds of policy,  that His  Majesty&apos;.s  Government  should adhere  to the  general principle of  most-favoured-nation treatment within the Empire, rather than entflupon a new system of special agreements by which preference should be given onl)&apos;to those parts of the Empire which are prepared to reciprocate.  The  Committee,however, feel it difficult  in view of the result of the  inquiries  b) the Secretary o&apos;State for India, and in view of the considerable loss of revenue which.is involved, l&apos;
 recommend the extension of the increased preference to tobacco grown in India.  It is true that Nyasaland, the other  important source of Empire tobacco,  also gives no preference to British goods, but the. Committee felt that the case of Nyasaland could, perhaps,  be distinguished from that of India on the ground that an increased preference  to Nyasaland tobacco  would  certainly increase the growth  of Empire tobacco.  They have accordingly decided to recommend         That the existing preference on Empire-grown tobacco (other than tobacco        grown in India) should be increased from  one-sixth to one-quarter of the        duty. Spirits and Wines.    26. The position as regards Spirits and Wines  is briefly discussed in  the main Memorandum,  I.E.C.  (&quot; B &quot; Series) I.  The Committee recommend-        That no alteration in the existing preference on spirits or on wines imported        from the Dominions should be  entertained. New Duties on  Goods at present  Duty-free.    27. The above proposals have  been confined, broadly speaking, to increases of existing preferences.  It remains to deal with certain suggestions tor the imposition of new duties on goods, at present duty free, for the purpose of  granting preference on such goods when of Empire production. Apples.    28. The imposition of a duty on raw apples seems to the Committee to be  open to many objections, and  would, no doubt, give rise to considerable opposition on the ground that a tax was being levied on a widely  popular article of food.  After full consideration, the Committee recommend         That any proposal to impose a duty on foreign raw apples should be rejected. Canned Fish.    29. Information on the subject of Canned Fish is contained in  I.E.C. (&quot; B &quot; Series) X.   A duty of 10s. per cwt. on foreign imported fish of the descriptions of which  there is  a substantial  importation  both from the Empire and  from foreign countries (i.e.,  salmon,  lobsters, crabs,  and crayfish) might yield   250,000 per annum.    The Committee recommend         That  the  representatives of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  at the Imperial        Economic Conference  be  authorised to propose the imposition  of  a  duty        of  10s.  per cwt.  on foreign-imported  canned  salmon,  lobsters, crabs        and crayfish,  should any Dominion ask for the imposition of such  a duty at        the Conference. Hops.    30. The Inter-Departmental  Committee suggested in  I.E.C. (&quot; B &quot;  Series) I, that a  duty of  5, a cwt. might  be imposed on foreign hops,  with  duty-free admission of hops grown within the Empire.   The  Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries,  however, has expressed the view that there is considerable  danger in permitting Empire hops to be imported entirely free of duty.   He informs the Committee that there is at present a greater  quantity of hops  available than is! required, and that hop growers in this country are being told that only three-quarters of their product can be utilised.  In the circumstances, the Minister of AgricultureI and Fisheries suggests that it is really undesirable to  encourage the importation ofj hops at all.!    31. The Committee recommend I        That  the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  at the ImperialI        Economic Conference should be authorised to entertain a. proposal to imposej        a duty of  5 a cwt. on  all foreign grown hops after the  expiry of the period        of.control, a preference of 50 per cent, or  33^ per cent,  being accorded to        Empire-grown hops.
Tinplates and Containers.    32. The Committee have had under consideration a suggestion by the First Lordof the Admiralty (I.E.C. (B Series) XIII) in favour of an import duty on tinplate,this duty being remitted in the case of containers imported from the Empire whichare made of British tinplate.  The object was to stimulate both the export of Britishtinplate to the Dominions and the export here from  the Dominions of all fruits, fish,meat and other foodstuffs put up in tin containers.    33. In view of the great practical  difficulties to which such a duty would giverise, the proposal was not pressed by the First Lord  of the Admiralty.    34. The Committee recommend          That in view  of  the practical difficulties involved, the imposition of an         import duty on foreign tinplates or containers should not be entertained.                                                                    :.j iLuxury Fruits.    35. The Committee have had under consideration suggestions contained in theletter from, the First Lord of the Admiralty (I.E.C. (B Series) XIII) in  favour of theimposition of a  duty on luxury fruits, such as pineapples, grape fruits, &amp;c, withpreference for Empire fruits.    The Committee recommend          That, should any Oversea Government press  for it, the representatives of         His Majesty&apos;s  Government at the Imperial Economic Conference should be         authorised to give favourable consideration to the proposal to impose a duty         on foreign grape  fruits, or pineapples, or  other  specified &apos;&apos; luxury&quot; fruits         (not including  oranges) up to a maximum limit of 10s. 6d. a cwt.Stamp Duty and  Income  Tax.    36. Finally, under the heading of Imperial Preference, mention must be made ofthe suggestions by the First Lord of the Admiralty (I.E.C.  (B Series) XIII) in favourof a preferential remission of Stamp Duty on Empire investments and a preferentialdifferentiation of Income Tax as between dividends earned by Empire and by foreigninvestments.  The Committee are impressed by the grave practical difficulties which(as pointed out in the Memorandum I.E.C. (B Series) XVIII, prepared  by the Inter-Departmental Committee  with  the  assistance of  the Board of Inland Revenue)appear to be inseparable from these proposals.    37. It was suggested to the Committee that it  might be practicable to go someway towards meeting the proposals if the existing  preference enjoyed  in respect ofstamp duty by  the securities of Colonial  Governments and Municipalities could beextended to railways, harbours  and other  public utility works with  regard to whichthe physical locus of the undertaking could not stand in doubt.   It is clear, however,that this would involve  the extension of the  preference to home undertakings of this character, a result which would be open to strong objections, and, among other things,might be described  IS  1 discouragement of industry.    38. As regards income tax, the Committee understand that the recent alterations in  the law  have in effect  removed the grievance of  duplication of income tax asbetween this country and other parts  of the British Dominions.    39.  After discussion, the First Lord intimated  to the Committee that he did not desire to press his proposals. The Committee recommend.          That in view of the practical difficulties involved, any extension of Imperial         preference in connection with  stamp duty or  income tax should not be         entertained.Petroleum Policy.    40.  The Committee have carefully considered the question of the inclusion in theAgenda of the Imperial  Economic Conference of  the question of  Imperial Policyrespecting Petroleum.  The Committee understand that the interested  departments are not wholly in agreement as to the rspective merits  of the &quot; Open Door &quot;  and the restrictive policy in the matter of Oil concessions.  There is, at present,  no indication that any of the Oversea Governments desire toNraise the question, while no  Depart-ment represented on the Inter-Departmental Committee has expressed any wish thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should take the initiative in the matter.
                                     %   In a  Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental  Committee  (I.E.C. (B  Series)VI), that Committee recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to refrain from takingthe initiative in regard to the inclusion of Petroleum questions in the Agenda of theConference.   In these circumstances the Committee recommend the Cabinet        To  refrain  from taking the initiative  in proposing the inclusion in the       Agenda for the Imperial Economic Conference of  any question relating to       Petroleum&apos;.Status of  Dominion  Trade Commissioners.   41.  The  question of the  Status  of Dominion  Trade Commissioners in foreigncountries has been raised by  the Canadian  Government.  At present the Commis-sioners have neither  diplomatic nor consular status, and the  Canadian government feel that they should be given such recognition as the dignity of their Office demands.It has been suggested that  the more important Dominion Commissioners : hould betreated  in this respect  in  the same way as British Commercial  Counsellors  and commercial  Secretaries in foreign countries, e.g., that the Dominion Trade Commis-sioners should form part of the Embassy or Legation Staffs and thus enjoy diplomaticprivileges and immunities.   This  solution, however, involves  that His Majesty&apos;ambassador or Minister will be responsible for the actions of the Dominion TradeCommissioners vis-a-vis the Foreign Government concerned,  and consequently thatthe Dominion Trade Commissioner will look to the Ambassador or  Minister for support in his relations with the Foreign Government concerned,  and will be subjectto his general guidance in the  conduct of these relations.    The Committee recommend to the  Cabinet     (1.) That the more important Dominion Trade Commissioners should, in future,         be included in the diplomatic staffs and should be given  precisely the         same standing as British Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries, on the         understanding that each Dominion Trade Commissioner will  be  subject         to the general supervision and guidance  of  Flis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador         or Minister in the country to which he  is  assigned.    (2.) That as  regards  the  less important  Dominion  Trade  Commissioners,         endeavours should be made to  obtain  for  them  the same recognition,         exemptions and privileges as may be accorded by the Foreign Government         concerned to His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers in that country.    (3.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to notify         the Canadian Government that if that Government desire to bring the         question of  the Status  of  Dominion Trade Commissioners before the         Imperial Economic Conference, the question will be placed on the Agenda.Co-operation in Financial  Assistance to Imperial Development.    42. The Committee have carefully  considered the  important  question  ofco-operation  with the Dominions and the  Australian  State Governments  in thedevelopment  of the resources of the British Empire to the best possible advantage.The Committee have examined a scheme submitted by the President  of  the Boardof Trade (see Appendix III), the underlying principle of which is that Great britain should use her credit in order that the Empire might co-operate  in development schemes.  It is proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make advances ofinterest or guarantee interest within a maximum of  2,000,000 a year to PublicUtility undertakings in the Dominions which are approved  by  their  own  Govern-ments and approved also  by the British  Government.  It is  intended that the undertakings assisted should be of  such a  kind that, if put  in hand  rapidly, theywould confer direct benefit both on the Dominions and on employment by the placing of  orders in  the United Kingdom.  While  the advances of interest would be for aiperiod  of years,  the intention  is  that the advances  should,  wherever possible,ultimately be repayable out of the profits of the undertakings.    Representatives of the Banking and Trading interests have expressed themselvesin favour of  the policy, and the necessity for drastic measures on the lines indicatedhas been emphasised by the disquieting situation as regards trade prospects indicatedm a Memorandum CP. 312 (23), recently circulated to the Cabinet.    After consultation with the Prime Minister, telegrams  have  been despatched to  the Dominions and India, explaining the general lines on which His Majesty&apos;sgovernment will be prepared to consider detailed schemes of co-operation in financial
assistance  to Imperial development.    For  text of  telegram  in question  seeAppendix IV.    The Committee recommend the Cabinet          To approve in principle the scheme for co-operation in financial assistance         to Imperial development set out in the Memorandum dated the 12th May,         1923, by the President of the Board of Trade (Appendix III).Imperial Preference in Public  Contracts.    43. The Committee are much impressed with the desirability of securing somecommon measure of agreement among the Departments concerned as to the adoptionof a uniform policy in regard  to Imperial Preference  in Public Contracts.  It isunderstood  that the Treasury have taken up the question with the Departmentsconcerned, and in these circumstances the Committee recommend to the Cabinet-         That if possible uniform rules respecting Imperial  Preference in Public         Contracts should  be  adopted, and that the Inter-Departmental Committee         should proceed with the preparation of agreed rules  to be applied by all         Government Departments.Import and  Export of Live-Stock.    44. The Committee have examined the question whether it would be best for theBritish Government to initiate  a discussion on the import and export of live-stock,or whether the matter should be left for the Dominions to raise at  the Conference.On the one  hand,  the political. arguments  strongly favour the plan of leaving thequestion to be raised by the Dominion Governments; on the other hand, it would be easier for His Majesty&apos;s Government to  defend definite proposals submitted by them than   to  criticise  more  far-reaching  proposals  put   forward  by   DominionGovernments.    The&apos; Committee recommend to the Cabinet      (i.) That the  Minister of  Agriculture and  Fisheries should be authorised to           draft a Bill on the lines of the original Clause 4 of the Importation of           Animals Bill, 1922.     (ii.) That, the Draft  Bill should be submitted  to  the  Imperial Economic           Conference, and that the representatives  of the  British Government           should  undertake  at the Conference to give  the same terms to other           Dominions as have been  given to Canada, and that as regards breeding-           stock, such provisions as are made should be on a strictly reciprocal basis.1Consultation between the  British and Dominion  Agriculturalists.     45.  A suggestion has been made that a  meeting  should be arranged betweenDominion  Agriculture  representatives  and  the  British  Agricultural  AdvisoryCommittees previous to or during the course of the meeting of the Imperial EconomicConference,  for  the purpose  of  discussing  questions  of  common  interest  toagriculturalists at home and overseas.   If any useful purpose is to be  served theConference must be strictly unofficial and the Government should take no part in it.     In  these  circumstances  the  Committee  have requested  the  Minister  ofAgriculture and  Fisheries to  move  the  Secretary of State  for the Colonies tocommunicate the above suggestion to  the  Dominion Governments as one  emanating from unofficial sources.Imperial Co-operation for Economic Defence.     46. The Cabinet will remember that the  original telegram of invitation inconnection with the Imperial Economic Conference mentioned as one of  the matters for consideration by the Conference the  possibility of mutual co-operation amongthe various Governments to safeguard their economic interests in relation to foreigncountries,  or for  promoting  international arrangements  for  the more equitabletreatment of commerce.    . The Committee recommend to the Cabinet          That the following draft Resolution with regard to flag discrimination         should be approved :     * The Cabinet decided to omit recommendations (i) and (ii), and insert the following :         &quot; That the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries be authorised to draft a Bill for the admission of    &quot; pedigree cattle from the Dominious on a strictly reciprocal basis.&quot;    In order  to reassure agriculturalists that nothing would&apos; be done at tho Imperial Conference to tlie detriment of British agriculture, the Prime Minister decided that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisher^ should be one of the representatives  of the British Government at the Imperial Conference.
                           &quot; FLAG DISCRIMINATION.                            &quot; (Draft  Resolution).            &apos;1 In view of the vital  importance to the British Empire of safe-        &apos;&apos; guarding its overseas carrying trade against all  forms of discrimination        &quot;by foreign countries,  whether open or disguised, the representatives of        &quot; the Governments of the Empire declare         &quot;(1.)  That it is their  established  practice to make  no discrimination              &apos;&apos; between the flags of shipping using their ports, and  that they              &apos;&apos; have no intention of  departing from this practice as  regards              &apos;&apos; countries which treat ocean-going shipping under the British flag              &quot;on a footing of equality with their own national shipping.        &quot; (2.)  That in the event of danger arising in  future to the overseas shipping              &quot;of the  Empire through  an  attempt  by  a foreign country  to              &apos;&apos; discriminate against the British flag, the Governments of  the              &quot; Empire will consult  together as to  the best means of meeting  the              &quot;situation.&quot;Imperial Economic Committee.   47. Various proposals, emanating from different quarters, have been made forthe establishment of  some continuing body, the function  of which  . would be tocomplete or carry on  the work of the  Imperial Economic  Conference,  and thusfurnish a connecting link between that Conference and the next similar Conference.In this connection it  has been  suggested  that it.might be preferable to.entrustAgricultural questions to a separate body,  which might be  a Sub-Committee of theproposed continuing Economic Committee.  This Sub-Committee might, or mightnot,  in the course of  time develop into  an independent body, dealing purely with agricultural questions.   The Committee recommend to the  Cabinet    (1.) That  the question of an Imperial Economic  Committee should be discussed          at the  Imperial Economic Conference;  that the Dominions  should be          encouraged to initiate.the discussion, but, that if they are  not prepared          to do so, it should be initiated on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   (2.) That  the arrangement which  seems most likely to prove satisfactory is for          a general Economic Committee to be constituted,  with powers to.appoint          Sub-Committees.   (3.) That  the Terms of Reference to the Committee should be &quot; to consider  any          &quot; matters of an economic and  commercial character, not being  matters          &quot; within the  scope of the Imperial Shipping  Committee,  or  of  any          &quot;officially  constituted  Inter-Imperial  Organisation,  which, may  be          &quot; referred to them by or through any of the Constituent Governments for          &quot;the purpose of facilitating  Inter-Imperial trade.&quot;    (4.)  That if  any of the Dominions should suggest the addition to  the Terms of          Reference  of such words as &quot; while fully respecting the autonomy of the          &quot; various Governments of the Empire in matters of commercial and fiscal          &quot; policy,&quot;  the amendment should be accepted.    (5.) That the Inter-Departmental Committee should be instructed to work out in          greater detail a scheme for the representation of the various Governments          or interests on the Committee in accordance with the principles indicated.Workmen&apos;s Compensation.    48. The Committee have considered the desirability of a common Empire policy as regards certain aspects of Workmen&apos;s Compensation,  and also the questionwhether this subject should be placed on the Agenda for the Economic  Conference.    The Committee have authorised         The  Secretary of State for  the  Colonies and the Secretary of State  for        India to send&apos; a communication to the Dominions and India suggesting the        addition to  the Agenda for the Conference  of  an item respecting  the        desirability  of  a common Empire  policy  as  regards  certain aspects of        Workmen&apos;s  Compensation,  and  describing  briefly  the  nature  of   the        proposals m contemplation.       [10423]            &apos;                                           c
Co-operation for Technical  Research.    49. The Committee  did not feel in a position  to deal with  this Item  in theAgenda of  the  Imperial Conference pending  the  receipt of the  Report of theCommittee which is now considering the reorganisation in the future of the imperial institute.   The Committee understood that the Report in question is now practicallysettled, but that it would not be available for Ministers for at least another fortnight,The Committee  have accordingly requested the Parliamentary Under-Secretary tothe Colonial Office and the Parliamentary Secretary,  Department of Overseas Trade,to act as a small  Sub-Committee to consider the above Report as soon as received, andto recommend whether it should be transmitted to the Overseas Governments as ascheme which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to support.Report by Imperial  Shipping Committee on  Economic  Size and Speed of  Ships.    50. The Committee have considered the Report  (I.E.C. (23) 11)  of the  imperial shipping Committee on the  Economic Size  and Speed of vessels trading between theUnited Kingdom and Australia, and on the  subsidies necessary to maintain  speedsin excess of  the economic speed.    The Committee understand that  the subject-matter of this Report has recentlybeen considered by the Cabinet  (Cabinet 39  (23),  Conclusion  2) in connection with proposals for the development of a commercial Airship Service, and that the cabinet had adopted the Report  (C.I.D. 436-B) of  the Sub-Committee of the  Committeeof Imperial Defence, subject to the financial and other  arrangements being  settledto the satisfaction  of the Treasury  and the other  Departments  concerned.    TheCabinet has also directed that when  the announcement of this decision is made itshould be stated that the  decision had been taken after full consideration,  not only of the Report of the Committee of  Imperial  Defence, but also of the Report of theImperial Shipping Committee, and  that the Government have been greatly influenced by the importance, in the  interests of Imperial trade and communications, of  giving effect as far as possible to the recommendations of the latter Committee.    The Committee  have  taken note of the Cabinet decision summarised aboveiDefence Aspect  of Food  Supplies.    51. The Committee have considered a Memorandum (I.E.C.  (B Series) XXI)on  the Defence  Aspect of Food  Supplies,  prepared  by the ,Inter-DepartmentalCommittee.   The Inter-Departmental Committee state that, after careful considera-tion, they have come to the conclusion that  it  is quite impossible for them to prepareany useful  statement on  the subject for the purpose of the  Economic  Conferencewithout a knowledge of Military and Naval data,  which is  not  at their  disposal.They therefore submit that the question is one with which the Committee of  ImperialDefence are alone competent to deal.  . The Committee  recommend  to the Cabinet          That the question  of the Defence Aspect of Food  Supplies is not one for         consideration by the Economic Conference, hut that the question  should        be  discussed, if at all, at the Imperial Conference or, in the alternative, by         the Committee of Imperial Defence, reinforced on this occasion by repre-        sentative members of the Imperial Conference^The Hague Rules.    52. The Committee have had under consideration a Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental Committee (I.E.C. (B Series) XXII) relative  to the question whether legislation  embodying the revised  Hague  Rules respecting  the carriage of goodsby  sea should be discussed at  the Imperial Economic Conference.    The  Inter-Departmental Committee recommended that this question  should  remain on theAgenda for the Imperial Economic Conference,  and that, if so, the MemorandumAnnex &quot; A &quot; to  I.E.C. (B Series) XXII should be transmitted to the Dominions andIndia, together with copies  of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill and of the report thereon by the Joint Select Committee.    The Committee recommend to the Cabinet     (i.) That the recommendation  of the  Inter-Departmental Committee  that the           question of legislation embodying  the revised Hague Rules respecting the    * The Lord President of the Council, as Chairman of  the Committee of Imperial .Defence, reported thatthe  Committee of Imperial Defence was about  to consider the  defence aspect of food supplies. In thesecircumstances it was agreed that the defence  aspect of food supplies should not  be considered by theImperial Economic Conference..
          carriage of goods by sea, should remain on the Agenda for the Imperial          Economic Conference should be adopted;  and    (ii.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for          India respectively should be authorised to transmit to the Dominions and          India the Memorandum Annex &quot; A &quot; to I.E.C. (B Series) XXII, together          with copies of  the Carriage  of Goods by Sea  Bill, and of the Report          thereon by  the  Joint  Select  Committee, as  proposed by  the  Inter-          Departmental Committee.Extra-Territorial Powers.    53.  The Committee have taken note of the following expression of opinion bythe Inter-Departmental Committee on the subject of Extra-Territorial Powers on merchant Shipping Law and Administration :         &quot; If the ideal solution of the problem an Imperial Code is impracticable,    &quot; it seems  desirable to maintain1 the present position as laid  down  in  the    &quot; Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and&apos;in the resolutions of the Conference of 1907.    &quot; Recognition of extra-territorial jurisdiction on the part of Self-governing    11 Dominions,  beyond what is already implied  in Imperial Acts, as indicated    &quot; above, would raise difficult questions of conflict of  jurisdiction, and is very    &quot; undesirable unless and until it is clear that such conflicts&apos; will not arise, i.e., by    &quot; uniformity of legislation where  a vessel comes under two jurisdictions &quot; ;and recommend  to the Cabinet         That, if the question were raised by any of the Dominions at the Conference,        and if  in the last  resort it should be found impossible  to obtain an  agreed        solution of the shipping difficulty at the  Economic Conference,  the British        Representatives should be authorised to suggest that this question should be        referred to the Imperial Shipping Committee.  -Meat Supplies.    54.  The Committee have  examined a Memorandum (I.E.C. (C Series) IX) bythe   Inter-Departmental   Committee  on  the  recommendations   of   the  Inter-Departmental Committee on Meat Supplies (Cd. Paper 456).    The Committee recommend to the Cabinet         That proposals for the establishment of a system of control and  supervision        of  the meat trade such, as those contemplated in the Report of the Inter-        Departmental Committee on Meat Supplies should not be entertained.Education.    55.  The Committee have  had before  them a Memorandum (I.E.C. (B Series)IX, Annex B, page 4, paragraph 8) respecting the proposals of Sir A. Balfour withregard to the teaching of British Empire History.    The Committee recommend to the Cabinet         That all practicable  steps should be taken to encourage  the teaching of        British Empire History in the schools throughout the Empire.Imperial Penny Postage.    56.  The  Committee have had  before them  a Memorandum by  the  Inter-Departmental  Committee  (I.E.C.  (C  Series)  VI),  relative to  the suggested.reintroduction of Imperial  Penny Postage.      .        \    The Committee recommend to the Cabinet     (1.) That, while the question of the reintroduction of Imperial Penny Postage          should not be placed on the Agenda of the Imperial Economic Conference,          some reference should be made to the question in the general statement to          be made at the opening of the Conference.    (2.) That, subject to the views of the Postmaster-General,  the above reference          should take the form of stating that, as sooa as  it is found  possible to          reintroduce  Penny Postage in Great Britain, the concession will be          extended to the Empire as a whole.    The Committee have also requested         The Board of Trade  to prepare a memorandum setting out the objections        to the institution of uniform rates of parcel postage throughout the Empire.      [10423]                                                      c  2
Deferred Rates on  Telegraphic  Communications.     57. With regard to the question of the rates for deferred telegraph messages,the Postmaster-General has informed the Committee that the Eastern and associated companies propose, at an early date, to introduce a service of &quot; Cable Letters &quot; atone-fourth of the ordinary rates, with a  minimum of twenty words per message.which will, in effect, put the whole of the Empire (except the West Indies) on the same footing as Canada in this respect.  The question of applying a similar arrangement!to the West Indies will be  considered in  connection with  the, new Telegraphic!Communications Scheme referred to in I.E.C.  (23)  7, Section IV.     The Committee recommend the Cabinet to take note of the above communication.Trade Catalogues.                                                            i     58. With  reference to  the question of the  Customs  treatment   of  Trade jCatalogues, the Committee agreed          That the question of the Customs treatment of Trade Catalogues should beI         brought before the Economic  Conference under the heading of Commercial!         Intelligence rather than of Customs  Tariffs, and that an effort should be I         made to induce the Dominions to  follow the example of India by according I         free admission to Trade Catalogues arriving through the post  from other I         parts of the Empire.Preparation  of Detailed Draft Agenda.     59. The Committee recommend to the  Cabinet          That the President of the Board  of Trade should be authorised to prepare I         a detailed draft Agenda for the Economic Conference.Arrangements for  the  Conference.     60. With  regard   to  the arrangements  for  the Economic  Conference, the]Committee recommend to the Cabinet      (1.)  That the proceedings of the Economic Conference should open  with al           general statement of the Imperial economic situation on lines similar to 1           the statement on Imperial policy to be made at the opening of the Imperial]           Conference.     (2.)  That all documents required by Ministers  for the  purpose of the Economicl           Conference should be printed, even if, as seems improbable, such printing           necessitates a Supplementary Estimate.     (3.)  That the President of the Board  of Trade should  be authorised  to arrangeI           for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce of Northern!           Ireland to be present at the Imperial Economic  Conference as an adviser           to the President of the Board of Trade, but not to take part in thej           deliberations of the Conference.Empire Currency.    61. The Committee have  taken  note of Memoranda  (I.E.C.  (C Series) 11and IA) which have been prepared by the Treasury in connection with the proposalsIsubmitted by Mr. J. F. Darling for unifying the currencies of the British Empire.Documents transmitted to  the  Dominions.    62.

                 IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.Summary of the Committee&apos;s Recommendations in favour of  New  or                      Increased Preferences.                        I. General Recommendations.    1. That the general line to the taken should be that in order to encourage thedevelopment of  Empire settlement and the granting of  Dominion preference toBritish goods, as well as with a view to the alleviation of unemployment at home, theBritish Government should endeavour to give as extensive further preferences asmay be possible without violation of the Ministerial pledges.  &quot;  2. That any concession made should be  granted generally to the whob Empire,and should not be the subject of separate Dominion agreements.*    3. That  a  total  remission of  the duty  on certain  Empire  products  is  not inconsistent with the Ministerial pledges.    L That  the  imposition of  any  new or increased  duty on food  should be conditional on an adjustment being.made in respect of other duties on food, so as tosecure that food taxation should not be increased in the aggregate.                         [See Report, paragraph 8.]                     II. Increases of Existing Preferences. 1. Dried Fruits.    (i.) Currants. That in the event of the question of an increased preference on currants being raised at the Imperial Economic Conference, the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government  should  have a free hand to deal with the Australian demand on its merits, within the  limits of  the  proposal which  has  been under consideration by the Committee, namely, an increase of the duty on foreign currants from 2s. to a rate not exceeding 10s. Qd. per cwt. with complete exemption for Empire currants.  They should, at the same time, be requested to bear in mind the importance of so timing and presenting any consequential proposals to Greece as to minimise the political and economic disadvantages apprehended by the Foreign Office.    (ii.)  Other Dried Fruits. (a.)  That an extension of the existing tariff rate to certain classes of dried fruits which are at present duty free would not be inconsistent with Ministerial pledges, and should be conceded if pressed for by the Dominions.    (6.)  That dried fruits of Empire production should be admitted free of  duty to Great Britain.                       [See Report, paragraphs  10-13.] 2. Preserved Fruits and Jams.    (i.) That authority should be given to  the  representatives of His  Majesty&apos;s[Government at the Imperial Economic Conference  to propose:     (a.)  That a duty of 5s.  per cwt., in addition  to the existing duty on sugar (if           any), used in preserving should be imposed on foreign-preserved apples,           pears, pineapples,  peaches, apricots  and  nectarines.   Other  preserved           fruits could be added to  the list hereafter should the Dominions so wish.    (b.)  That Empire preserved fruits should be exempt from this new duty.    (ii.)  That no proposal should be entertained  for extending the  duty to fruit[pulp.                                                               i                       [See Report, paragraphs  14-17.]p. Sugar.    That the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the Imperial Economic ponference should be authorised to propose that a  preference of  an  amount not less pan the present amount, viz.,  approximately \d. a lb., should be given for a period Y ten years on all Empire  sugar imported into Great Britain. i                      [See Report, paragraphs  18-20.]

Co-operation in Financial Assistance  to Imperial  Development.                     Memorandum by the Board of Trade.    1. The encouragement of  Imperial development by various means is the  maiijpurpose of the Economic Conference.  In the original telegram of invitation it wasjstated that the general reference  to the Conference would  be &quot; to study the]&quot; possibilities of co-operation  in  the  development of the  resources of the Britislil&quot; Empire, and  the strengthening of economic  relations  between its constituent&quot;parts.&quot;              &quot;          .    2. On the question of policy involved, the President of the Board of Trade, onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, stated, in the  House of  Commons on the10th  April, that  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  would take  up  at  the  ImperialConference the whole question of co-operation  with the Dominions  and with theState Governments of the Dominions as to the development of their resources.  he observed tha,t all those who entered into that Conference would go into it, so far as)the circumstances of the  individual State permitted, with the common object, whetherby preference or by financial co-operation, to develop their mutual resources to1 thabest advantage.  We should consider how best we could use our credit in order thatwe and the Dominions may co-operate in schemes to  our common advantage.    Speaking of the Crown Colonies, the President referred to the desirability of using British credit to enable Colonial  development of a revenue-producing character to be anticipated so that orders may  be placed in this country during the presentperiod of rnemployment. He added that the Government would ask the authority ofthe House to make the necessary advances so soon as the schemes were ready for whichthese advances are needed.    3. The subject of Imperial development is,  of course, to some  extent covered bythe memoranda on Oversea Settlement, and Imperial Preference. It is, however
essential to explore the further question, how far any scheme  of  direct financialco-operation is practicable for the encouragement of forms of development which areof special value from an Imperial point of view.  The schemes in question are thosewhich serve not only to promote local development or the settlement of population inone particular part of the Empire, but also to give direct encouragement to the trade of another part of the Empire, so that two or more different Governments are directly interested  in  their  practical realisation and may reasonably  co-operate for  the.purpose.   The present memorandum  is  an attempt  to give  some answer  to thisquestion on the basis of the policy announced on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s government by the President of the Board of Trade.    4. It is presumed  that the  word  &apos;&apos; co-operation&apos;&apos;  was used, advisedly in  the telegram of invitation with a view to limiting  the purview of the Conference to schemes involving  direct co-operation between two or more Governments.  To  includeforms of assistance which do not involve such co-operation would unnecessarily widen the scope  of  the  discussion, and there  seems no  ground for bringing before  theImperial Economic Conference  matters such as  the Export Credits Scheme or  theTrade Facilities Act, which only involve action by, and in the interest of, the  UnitedKingdom, although such action sometimes takes the form of assistance to projects inthe Oversea parts of the Empire.    5. We may also, for practical purposes,  rule out schemes which are of a natureonly to benefit a particular locality, and which only interest other parts of the Empirefrom the point of view of the general Imperial  sentiment.  It seems very unlikelythat any Government  of the Empire will put up  money in the  form of grants orguarantees for purposes which offer no prospect of  direct benefit  to the developmenttrade or population of that part  of  the Empire.   We may, therefore,  postulatemutuality of direct advantage as the second essential condition .    6. Following  from the last stated condition, we may further limit the problem by excluding co-operation in financial assistance to oversea industries of a kind whichwould compete injuriously with home industries.  It would be difficult to defend tothe taxpayer the use of his money or credit to foster direct competition with his owntrade.  It  may in practice be found that insistence on this condition will, in effect,limit the scope of development schemes to be assisted to what are  generally known as public  Utility Undertakings,  including  communications, power   lighting, waterirrigation, drainage, land settlement and kindred purposes.  Assistance to some ofthese classes of undertakings might possibly be represented as a subsidy to overseaagriculture and competition with the British farmer, but it is thought that in thesecases the subsidy is too  indirect to justify the exclusion  of such schemes from consideration  on their  merits.    -7.  The next question which arises is whether the schemes to  be assisted must be publicly managed, or whether privately managed undertakings mav be included.   Itappears highly desirable not to exclude private enterprises provided that they fall within  the category of Public  Utility Undertakings.   (It is understood that  theColonial Office have some doubt whether schemes in the  Crown Colonies should notbe limited  to publicly managed concerns, and should they press for this limitation itwill be for Ministers to decide the question of  policy raised.)    8.  Though in the above  observations  the  general expression &quot;co-operation&quot; between two or more Governments &quot; has been used, it will in practice be found thatone party to the co-operation will almost  invariably be the United Kingdom, whosecredit will be used  to promote the development of the resources  of some overseadominion or colony.  We have, therefore, to contemplate not a general multi-lateralscheme of mutual guarantee to be subscribed by all the Governments of the Empire a proposition which would pTobably not be looked upon with favour but rather a series of bi-lateral  agreements  between  the  United Kingdom  and particularDominions  and Colonies with  a view  to co-operation in  particular schemes  ofdevelopment.    9. According  to the conditions laid down above, each of these bi-lateral schemesmust be of a  mutual character both  in respect of contributions  and of benefit.Broadly speaking, the contribution of the United  Kingdom will be the  use of itsfunds and  credit, and the immediate advantage to be repaid by the United kingdom will be the additional employment afforded to our population from the orders placedm the United Kingdom in connection  with the scheme,  together with the openingsafforded for overseas settlement. . It, therefore,  seems essential  to  stipulate that  acertain proportion of the capital raised with Imperial assistance should be expendedin the United Kingdom on products of British manufacture, or (alternatively) that      [104.23&apos;]           .                                              D
that portion of the capital which is not expended locally should be wholly or mainlyexpended in the United Kingdom.  The precise conditions as regards the placing of orders would probably be embodied in each of the special agreements and would doubtless be varied so as to adapt them to different conditions.   It is only necessaryhere to lay down the general principle.     10. The condition that any financial assistance should be mutual involves twoconsequences:      (1.)  No private scheme for oversea development can receive the assistance of           the Imperial  Government unless it is endorsed by the  Government of the          . Dominion or  (if private schemes are admitted in the case of Colonies) by           the Colony concerned.     (2.)  In each case the Dominion or Colonial Government must take responsibility           for some share of the assistance.     11.  The proportions in which the United Kingdom and the local government shall share the burden will, of course, be laid down specifically in each scheme andthere is no need for any hard or fast rule of proportion.   &apos;But, as a safeguard tothe British Treasury, it may be wise  to lay down the principle  that the dominion government shall  co-operate effectively.   Whether such  a rule should also apply toColonial schemes is a matter of policy for decision by Ministers.     12.  It seems necessary to contemplate some form of machinery for the examina-tion of development schemes in each  part of the Empire which takes part in theproposed) co-operation.    Schemes,  whether  privately  or publicly  managed,  for development in a Dominion would naturally, in  the first place,  come before theDominion authorities, which would transmit them, if approved, to the  competent authority in the United Kingdom, with a statement of the extent to which theywould receive Dominion support, subject to a contribution by the United Kingdom,The) competent authority in  the  United  Kingdom  would  examine the  scheme,consulting, so far as necessary, the Dominion representatives and interests concerned,and would advise  His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the support, if any, to be given,Whether any  modification of  this procedure would be necessary  in the case of colonial schemes is a matter for consideration.   But all these details of procedurecan be settled without difficulty if once the general principles of the proposal are determined.         ,     13.  There remains the highly important question of the form  which financialassistance should take.   There are three main methods for consideration : &apos;      (i.) Direct advance of capital on easy terms.     (ii.) Guarantee of the interest on capital privately raised for a limited period           of years.     (iii.) The payment or advance of the whole or part of the  interest on capital           privately raised for a limited period of years.     Without  excluding  any of these three methods it  is thought that method (i)(direct advance) should be very sparingly adopted, and probably only in cases in whichthe amount involved is  small.    The  Colonial Office have called attention to casesof this kind, especially in small Colonies where the amounts required are so limitedthat the method of a public issue with Government guarantees seems unnecessarilyelaborate.  This method is solely intended to meet exceptional  cases of this kind.Method  (ii) (guarantees of interest)  may prove a very useful method of assistancein many cases, but it will by no means always meet the case of undertakings which,though of an  ultimately revenue-producing kind, may  remain unremunerative fora considerable time during the period of construction.  Moreover, there is a dangerof  depressing  Dominion  credit by the adoption of a method which may suggest to investors  that an Imperial guarantee  is necessary.   Method (iii) (payment oradvance of interest)  is  designed specially to meet this class of cases, and it  willprobably be the most usual method of assistance employed.     14.  It is  suggested that,  as a general rule,  payments of interest made undermethod  (iii) should take the form of advances rather than free grants.  By this, it is not suggested that the prospects of reimbursement should be the main criterion in  determining whether or not to support a scheme, but only that in the event of an undertaking  so assisted ultimately proving remunerative, there should be a valid claim for repayment of the advances made.  The precise conditions of such repay- ment  would naturally be settled in the schemes  themselves, but it is essential that
195181 the authority which deals with these proposals and settles) the terms of the schemes  should not impose conditions as to repayment which are sufficiently drastic to make  the scheme inoperative for the main purposes for which it  is intended.      This  observation seems necessary  because experience shows that  a Committee  of expert business men set up to advise His Majesty&apos;s  Government on  a  matter I involving  the expenditure of public money has a natural tendency, unless expressly  instructed to the contrary, to apply  ordinary  business standards to  the schemes  submitted to them.   In the present case it is presumed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-  ment would not wish to regard  the advances made for  the  assistance of oversea  development  as a  strictly commercial investment,  but  will rather  look  to  the  advantages to be obtained by the  reduction of unemployment,  the encouragement of  trade and the oversea settlement of population.      15. Lastly, there is the important question of the limit of financial commitments  under any schemes  of this kind,  and also of the limit of the period during which  guarantees or advances should be given.  These are matters for Ministers, but the  limits of   2,000,000 in any one year and a period of  15  years are tentatively  suggested for consideration.      An outline  scheme, embodying the above points is annexed so as to facilitate  discussion.        ANNEX.Tentative Draft Scheme.    1. The  Undertakings which may benefit from the scheme  are  Undertakingswithin the British Empire, but outside the United Kingdom for purposes of PublicUtility  (viz., communications,  power, lighting, water, drainage, irrigation, landsettlement, and other kindred purposes).    These  Undertakings may be  either  under  public or  private  control  ormanagement.    2. The  assistance to be given will (generally speaking) take the form of annualadvances to  the Undertaking of the whole or part of the interest on capital requiredfor new construction or development, payable for a period of not more  than [ten]years. Any advance so made shall be a  debt from the Undertaking, and shall &quot;berepayable out of profits or net revenue in accordance with terms to  be settled ineach case  by the agreement under which the advance is made.    Alternatively, the assistance may take the form of a guarantee of interest for,a period of  not more than [ten] years, or (in the exceptional  cases referred to inparagraph 8) of a direct advance of capital.    3. The  proportions in which any two co-operating Governments shall share thecost of assistance in any particular  case  shall (subject to paragraph 6) be decided by agreement between them, having regard to the circumstances.    4. Each Dominion or Colonial  Government  participating in the scheme shall make arrangements to receive and examine propositions with regard to existing orproposed  Undertakings within its territories, and transmit them  if approved to theUnited Kingdom Government, with  an  accompanying report  stating how far theDominion or Colonial Government is prepared to share in any financial assistance that may  be accorded.    5. The  appropriate United Kingdom Authority  shall consider the  applicationso transmitted,  and may enter into direct communication so far as necessary withrepresentatives of the Dominion or Colonial Government or of the Undertaking, andif it decides to proceed with the proposal, shall frame a draft agreement for approval by the two Governments.    6. His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  will be  prepared  to  consider propositionssubmitted in accordance with the above scheme provided that the total expenditurefalling on the United Kingdom in any one year shall not exceed  2,000,000.    7. It will be a condition of any assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government thata stipulated proportion of the capital raised with their, assistance or of that partof this capital which is not expended locally shall be expended  on machinery, plant,materials, &amp;c, manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.    8. His  Majesty&apos;s  Government shall have the option in any  particular case ofa Colonial  Undertaking in which  the  sum  involved is comparatively  small to substitute for the assistance contemplated under  the  above provisions a direct loan
of capital on which the whole or part of the interest during the period of assistanceshall be deferred.    9. The scheme shall remain in force for a period of fifteen years.    10. References in this memorandum to &quot;Dominions.&quot; apply equally to India.    Board of Trade, May 12, 1923.APPENDIX  IV.       CO-OPERATION IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO IMPERIAL DEVELOPMENT.                      Telegram to the Dominions and India.     Please  see  passage  in my telegram of 17th May, referring to questions ofco-operation for the fuller utilisation of natural resources.  Following is  general indication of lines on which His Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to results of discussion at Economic Conference, will be prepared to consider schemes of financial co-operation which may  be proposed with view to assisting early development of Public utility undertakings in Dominions,* which without such assistance would  be delayed ornot proceeded with. &apos; Undertakings assisted should be of  nature which,  if put inhand rapidly, would confer direct benefit both on Dominions* and on employment by  placing  of orders  in United Kingdom.   Conditions  and  limits of financialassistance and  shares of co-operating Governments in such assistance  would besettled in each case by special agreement.  Without excluding from considerationany form of assistance, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider guarantee of  interest or advance of part of interest for limited period is likely to prove the most generallyuseful method.  Specific Proposals under an agreed general scheme would naturally be examined carefully by competent authorities both  in  Dominions* and  UnitedKingdom before approval.* In cpfe of India substitute &quot; India&quot; for &quot; Dominions.&apos;
