The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as whollyunemployed  at the 9th July was 1,189,133, a decrease of 2,217 on the  previousweek.                il                         .   -  &apos;                 POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.    The position in Lancashire and the Midlands has continued to be satisfactory,but in the latter district, as well as  in Yorkshire  and Durham,  there have beenindications of depression.   The situation in Scotland and Wales has continuedsatisfactory.   The Bristol fields have continued active, and the Forest of Dean, after IRON AND STEEL.    No improvement has occurred in the position in the Midlands, unemployment having&quot; remained heavy, with a discouraging outlook.  The depression in Scotland has continued,  and prospects are uncertain.  Unemployment on the North-East Coast has become more acute.  In North Wales employment has continued good, but in South Wales there has been a diminution in output. SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.    Employment at most of the yards on the South-West  Coast  continues to  be indifferent,  The industrial dispute among the boilermakers has adversely affected this industry, particularly in Scotland and the North of England.  Conditions are unsettled on the Merseyside, where upwards of 6,000 operatives are unemployed.  On the other hand, a perceptible improvement has been reported from Welsh centres. ENGINEERING.    Trade  is quiet in London  and  the Home Counties. The improvement  in the South-Western Counties continues, but is unevenly spread.  In the Midlands, the motor and cycle section has, on the whole, been fair, business at some centres being very brisk.  In general engineering there has been a tendency towards improvement.In Yorkshire and the North  of England the slight improvement has been maintained.The textile section in Lancashire has been slack generally, and in general engineeringthe position is not satisfactory, but there is promise of increased activity.  Thedepression in Scotland has continued. In Wales the  general situation shows some improvement.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.a slight relapse, is again busy.
TEXTILES.    Cotton. In Lancashire the curtailment of production on an extended scale byspinners of American yarns continues.  Employment in the fine yarn section has,however, continued good.  The depression among weavers is still acute.  There is no sign of relief in the depression existing in Yorkshire.    Hosiery,  Woollen and Worsted. The position  of the hosiery trade  in theMidlands has altered but little; but the  change in the weather conditions is expectedto lead to seasonal improvement.   In Yorkshire unemployment has again increasedamong operatives in the woollen  and worsted industry.  In Scotland no material change has occurred,  and  prospects are no brighter.    Lace.-Unemployment has increased in the Midlands.  In the South-western counties unemployment has increased at both  Exeter and Chard.    Silk.-Although fluctuations in employment have taken place at certain  centres in the Midlands, activity is mainly restricted to artificial silk manufacture.    Jute. Trade is quiet, but the outlook is  a little more  hopeful.BUILDING.    Employment has been good generally, with a  persistent demand for  skilledoperatives.BOOT AND SHOE.    The slackness at Norwich has continued.  The depression in the South-western counties has  continued except  at  Bath,  where  trade is  improving.   A slightimprovement has occurred at some centres in the Midlands.CLOTHING.    The slackness in the tailoring, dressmaking and millinery trades has continued at most of the centres in London, the Home Counties, the South-Western counties and the Midlands.  In the wholesale clothing section trade has been very good in theMidlands,  and the  outlook in  the South-Western Counties is more hopeful, but in yorkshire  a tendency towards decline  is noticeable.POTTERY AND  GLASS.    Unemployment at the principal pottery centres  in the  Midlands has tended toincrease, and the prospects are not encouraging.TRANSPORT.     The industrial dispute among dock workers has hindered activity at  some ofthe principal ports in the country.  Certain ports on the North-East Coast whichhave  not been affected by the  dispute have, however, been  very busy in connectionwith the importation of timber.  Activity at Swansea has declined owing to quietnessin the tinplate trade.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW,      Ministry of Labour.

SUMMARY  OF  ACTION  TAKEN.                       [From Autumn 1920 onwards.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee.    The  prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident  in the early autumn of 1920.  On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a CabinetUnemployment Committee to consider the whole question  and devise means for relieving  unemployment.  This Committee continued to function till October 1922.The  present Government  appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the1st November, 1922.                       (A.) Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the8th November, 1920.  The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously.   Subsequent amendingActs modified the conditions as regards  rates  of  benefit,  extended the periods ofbenefit and increased the contributions.  As from November 1921 the unemployed workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision)for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed aspecial levy to provide for these grants.   The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922,amalgamated the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the speciallevy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extended until June 1923the special periods during which benefit might be drawn.   The authority to borrow
money from the Treasury was increased  to   30,000,000.   By the UnemploymentInsurance Act, 1923, which came into operation on the 12th April, 1923, the specialperiods for the.payment of  benefit have been extended  to  October  1923.   special provision has also been made by this Act for the following year to October 1924.TABLE  showing amount paid  out  in Unemployment Benefit  (including Benefit in    respect of  Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th    November,  1920, to the 7th July, 1923, -    1.

(B.)  Emergency Works and other Measures.    A full statement  of the  measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of  the latermeasures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous  issues of thisReport.  At  least 300,000 men  have had  employment on these schemes at various times, and  at the present time over 134,000 men are employed, exclusive of  the workprovided for  men in  ancillary  occupations and the effect&quot;of  the Export credits scheme.                      &apos;                       &apos;           .  ...       (C.)  Extensions of Remedial Measures during the  Winter 1922-23.    Some of  the  measures comprised in (B)  above are still in operation, e.g., pastsanctions of grants by the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry ofTransport.  The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under theTrade Facilities Act are in progress.    In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transportissued circular letters to  Local  Authorities  inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State  funds, might be undertaken for^ the relief  of  unemployment  in their  respective areas.   Approved schemes areassisted by grants made on  the  same bases as heretofore.  In the case of schemesassisted by the Unemployment  Grants Committee,&apos; particulars  of  grants  already sanctioned  are set out below.      [10378]                                                        E  3
G .    In &quot;September, 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular f letters  to  County  Councils (except  the London County Council) and Drainage I Authorities, inviting them to submit  schemes of land drainage which, if approved j might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the case^ of schemes assisted during  the previous year. All applications were  to be received in the case of. Drainage Authorities  on or  before  December  1,  1922 and  in the  case  of County Councils (Agricultural  Committees) on  or  before December  16, 1922.   County  Councils were also  circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms,  the conditions of assistance from the Ministry oi Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as the previous winter, with  the exception that the Ministry, instead of&apos; advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a  proportion  from the owners concerned,  will  make grants to  cover part only  of the total cost of each  scheme.  Further  circulars, issued to 1 County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, f notified the extension of the date up  to which applications might be received to the 1 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes.  The time for f receiving applications was further extended provisionally to  the 10th February, 1 1923.  Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date 1 are shown  below (see  III,  item 6).    On the 30th November,  1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House  of Common outlined the manner in  which measures taken by the late Government would continued and extended.     The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :     Unemployment Grants  Committee (for grants on the basis  of         60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ...       ...      ...       .....    600,000    Land Drainage                ...       ...      ...       :..     170,000    Afforestation ...        ...      .............     100,000    Acceleration of Government contracts          Office of Works   ..........          375,000         General Post Office       ...       ...          946,000                                                       -   1,321,000    It was also then announced that guarantees under  the Trade Facilities AclScheme would be made available up  to   50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme  would be extended if  necessary;  and  that  the  Local Authorities&apos; concerned would be  asked  to  co:operate  in  putting in  hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road,  which would  involve  an  expenditure of  about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.    In December 1922,  the Unemployment  Grants Committee  issued a furthei circular letter to Local Authorities inviting  them to submit schemes suitable foi assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill,  i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not  by loan.  The  conditions  under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those  previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification  of the conditions regarding the giving ol preference to 75 per cent,  ex-service men and the  engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.    &apos; On the 12th December,  1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House  of Commons, further announced  that, in addition  to the  acceleration  of contracts  by the Post Office and  Office of  Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would pui in  hand certain accelerated  building  work, together  with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.     On. the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission  issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were  available for  the  relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those  applicable to grants made during the previous winter.  The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for  the purpose of relief  schemes in  Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ Forests.     By the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act,  1922. (Session 2), enacted on the loth December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount  of loans the principal or interest of which mav  be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act,  1921, from   25,000,000 to  50,000,000.     On the 15th February,  1923, the  Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced an extension of  5,600,000 in the amount available  for grants in respect of approved road works by the Ministry of Transport.
