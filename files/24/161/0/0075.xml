PI 375(23). ii II i - .---faCAB,I HE Tt            THE RELATIONS OF THE ADMIRALTY AMD THE AIRFQROS.   -                    LEAKAGE OF INFORMATION.                    I in IIIIII i in i   n         J&apos;ri ... i            REPORT OF THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;S COMMITTEE.       We were asked to enquire into the leakages which had occurred in connection with the controversy between the Admiralty and the AirMinistry as to the Control of  the Fleet Air Arm.  We found that therehad been two separate leakages:-       (1)   As to the proceedings and. report &apos;of Lord Balfourrs             Sub-Commit tee..       (2)   As to a document appearing in the Press on the morning             of Saturday July 28th.       As tdf the first of these two leakages it appears that LordBalfourrs Sub-Committee reported on Saturday July 21st,  and thereport reached the Departments concerned on Monday July 23rd.  OnThursday 26th the  report was approved by the Main Committee withsome qualifications.  So far nothing had appeared in the Press onthe subject.  That afternoon at the Royal Garden Party the fact thatthe Sub-Committee  had reported against  the views of the  admiralty was well known and a subject of conversation.  It was also a gooddeal talked about  in the  Lobby of the House of Commons that evening,and on Friday morning there appeared a  sensational statement in the-Press.   We have been unable to trace how this leakage took place.The report was known to so many people  by the afternoon  of Thursdaythat the reference to it in the papers  was perhaps inevitable.       With regard to the second leakage the facts are as  follows       On the evening of  Thursday 26th,  the Lords of the Admiraltydecided to send in a further document supporting the Admiralty case,to what has been called the Main Committee, and that was in fact                              .  -1-
presented to  the  Main Committee  on Friday morning.   When the House  met on Friday there  was -considerable  agitation  about  the news  that had appeared that morning  alleging  that  the Sea Lords threatened resignation ever the controversy.    Admiral Gaunt the Member for Buckrosa,  finding the agitation, rang  up the Admiralty and spoke to Admiral  Pitzmaurice  the  D.N.I. saying that  there was considerable excitement and  asking  for information. Admiral Fitzmaurice replied that he  did not know anything about it but that  he would enquire, and he did in fact enquire of Admiral Puller.     Admiral Fuller gave him  the  annexed document with  a duplicate,  vrtiich he said was  part of whet he called  the &quot;ammunition&quot;  connected with the controversy with the  Air Ministry. -  It will be noticed  that  it is called the  &quot;Admiralty case&quot;. .  In  fact it had been used as a basis  for the  first  part of the document  drawn up by the Sea  Lords on  Thursday evening, though of this Admiral Puller says he was not aware at the  timer. Later in the morning Admiral Gaunt after again  telephoning the Admiraltys called at  the Admiralty and  saw  Admiral Fitzmaurice,  who handed him the document given  to  him by Admiral Fuller warning him on Admiral Fuller&apos;s instructions that it wps not to be used by the  Press, though both  Admirals Fuller and Pitzmaurice  seem to have been .aware  that Admiral Gaunt meant to use it  in order to inform other Members of Parliament. Admiral Gaunt had  no recollection of this warning, and in fact he returned  to the House of Commons  that afternoon and handed the document to  Kir. Hannon who  in turn gave it  to  the Pressr, Mr. Hannon was quite clear that he had never  been  informed that  the document  was in any way secret,         and
seenone of the parties concerned appear.to have considered itin that light.   Accordingly the document appeared on Saturday&apos;morning in the Press, described in some cases as an officialdefence of the Admiralty,  . Admiral Gaunt was aware that Mr.Hannon was&quot; - giving the document to the Press though he did not actually witness its being done.  The document as publishedembodied the first part of the memorandum communicated b&quot; theBoard of Admiralty to the Main Committee on Thursday morning.       We are of opinion that the document bended to AdmiralGaunt by Admiral Pitzmaurice on the instructions of AdmiralPuller, was  so given by these officials, knowing and intendingthat it was  to be given to others for the purpose of politicalaction and without adequate precaution against its communication to the Press.       In the course of our enquiries we gathered that Membersof Parliament who have acquaintances in the Admiralty are in the habit of communicating with them on any question of naval interest.   Admiral Gaunt told us that in fact he was therealmost every day, and one of the Admiralty witnesses spoke of itas quite a common thing for Members to call at the Admiralty forthis purpose.   Mr. Hannon informed us that though he has often been there when he was Secretary of the Navy league, theAdmiralty officials have always been very discreet.  That,  howeverwas not the  impression left upon us by other witnesses.    IndeedAdmiral Gaunt1s evidence was that it was perfectly legitimate forthe Admiralty to give information to Members of Parliament with  aview to their telling some particular line in naval discussion.       We are of opinion that this practice lends itself to greatabuse and should be discontinued.                         (Sinned) EC-BEET CECIL.                           &quot;     W.C. BFJ3GEHAH.                           &quot;     DOUGLAS McGAKEIi HOGG.
THE ADMIRALTY CASE.     &quot;The  Admiralty case is  based on the wording of the letters patent for appointing the Lords Commissioners  of theAdmiralty,    These letters patent give  full authority  to the lords Commissioners in all things which concern His Majesty&apos;sNavy and impose on them the  responsibility of seeing thatthe Navy is in all respects  efficient.     So long as these letters patent are in existence  theboard are  unable to divest themselves of any shred of  respon-sibility for tha efficiency  of the Navy, nor is it permissiblefor them to share that responsibility with another Departmentof State.     The Admiralty&apos;s principal reason for demanding an enquiry was their  responsibility for the fighting efficiency of theFleet. -     Apart from their sole responsibility for the fightingefficiency of the Fleet, the Admiralty are emphatic that dualcontrol in this matter would be nothing short of disastrous toour naval  power and the Empire.   Divided naval responsibility would lead to defeat in war, and no board could possibly submit to sueh principles of organisation, including training.     The Air Ministry contend that the  efficiency of the national home Defence Air Force will  be undermined If the naval air armwhich is to-day less than 5  per cent of the total air  strength,becomes an Admiralty responsibility.   This percentage will be considerably less when compared with the air force contemplated,,     Ia there any comparison between the principles on whichthe Admiralty and Air Ministry respectively base their case?
     To sum up, the Admiralty claim,  that  the  FleetAll1 Ar&quot;m Is an integral part  of  the fleet,  and as suchit should he solely an Admiralty responsibility, being administered and trained by  them in  a  similar mannerto every other arm of the Fleet.    What the Board of Admiralty are  fighting  againstis a system whereby a vital  arm of the Fleet  is administered and trained by  the Air  Ministry  and underAir Ministry responsibility&quot;,as es as aa as ss s: cs as: as ss sfc as
