DOOUMSHT IS mi PROpgRTY OF HIS BRITA.TOIO MAJESTY\S GOVERHMBIT).               BITBRKAIIOHAL PROTOOOL FOR THE RECOGNITIONIS (S3).               &quot; Qp THE VALIDITY OF COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS.                Memorandum by the President of the Eoard                               of Trade.A         I have read the memorandum of the Lord Chancellor!  with     the amended note by the Attorney-General on the subject  of     this Protoool and I do not understand that he considers that     any alteration is required, in Clauses 2 or 3.          Clause 1 provides in the second paragraph that&apos;each     contracting party reserves the right to limit the application     of the Protocol to contracts whioh are recognised as commercial     by its own legislation.   The Attorney-General regards this     provision as dangerous and would, I understand, prefer that it     should be omitted.   There is little doubt that the omission     of this provision from the Convention would prevent signature     by France, for the Frenoh expert on the Drafting Committee     whish prepared the Draft Convention stated definitely that  it     would be impossible for France to apply the Convention to  con-     tracts whioh were not recognised as commercial by her     legislation.          Clause 4 .obliges tribunals of any country, adopting the     Protocol to refer the parties to the decision of the     arbitrators, when they reoognise the existenoe of an arbitration     agreement whioh is valid and capable of being put into foroej     the Attorney-General fears that the construction of the words     &quot;valid and capable of being put into force&quot; may be doubtful.     He also draws attention to the fact that no provision is     included giving the tribunal any control over the arbitration     proceedings where a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement     is found to exist.   The- addition of the words &quot;capable of
being put into force&quot; was&apos;insisted upon by the French experton the Drafting Committee* who stated that the objeot of the insertion of these words was to avoid a position arising underwhioh a tribunal would refuse to act on the ground that thereexists a valid arbitration clause, even when in fact the arbitration cannot take placej  for example, owing to one ofthe parties being unwilling to nominate his arbitrator and thelaw of the oountry not providing in such a case for nomination of the arbitrator by the Court, but only for damages.   I have asked-our representatives at Geneva to make every effort toobtain the insertion of amendments to meet these points aefar as possible.     While I appreciate the points whioh have been raised bythe Lord Chancellor I fear that insistence on our obtainingsatisfaction on them is likely to involve a serious risk ofthe Convention, which goe3 a long way to moet the desire ofthe commercial community, being lost altogothor.                                  (Intld.)  P.L1.G.5th September, 1923.
