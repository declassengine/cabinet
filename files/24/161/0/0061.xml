NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.   AS the First Lord of the Admiralty has circulated N.D, (R) 4 of the 26th March,I circulate the attached N.D. (R) 12 of the 1st June.   I desire to make to it the three following addenda:    1. Lest my point is  obscure in  paragraph 5, I desire to make it clear that full         operational control does and should remain with the  Naval authorities.   2. In paragraph 9 I  am prepared to accept the word &quot; attachment&quot; for the word         &quot; secondment.&quot;   3, Whilst the report of the Sub-Committee makes several recommendations that         the Air  Council  strongly dislike,  they and I  are  prepared  to accept a         judgment that has  been arrived at alter months  of  the most  detailed         investigation.                                                           S. H.,                                                  Secretary of State for Air.   Air Ministry,. July 30, 1923.[10414]
j  Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]           Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.5SECRET.N.D. (R) 12.               COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.NATIONAL  AND  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE  COMMITTEE.SOB-COMMITTEE ON  THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE NAVY AND THE ROYAL                            AIR FORCE.    Notes by the Secretary of State for Air on the Evidence given before the  Sub-Committee on the Relations between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry.   1. I HAVE no wish to add another to the long list of the Admiralty and AirMinistry memoranda upon what has come to  be known as the Naval controversy between the  two Departments.  The broad issue  as to whether air-power isa primary Service or an auxiliary arm has been  stated and restated many timesduring the progress  of  the fight.  These  notes deal  neither with first  principlesnor past history; they are concerned rather with the  actual evidence that hasbeen given to the Sub-Committee.   Whilst not unnaturally I have listened to the witnesses with  a strong feeling in favour of the case of my own Department, I think  that I can claim that theconclusions that I now suggest are directly based upon the  evidence that we havebeard.   2. The Admiralty witnesses have, so it seems to me, attempted to substantiatetwo cases.  In the first place, they have wished to prove that the present  system is working badly, and in the  second  place they have made the bigger claim thatthe present system  could  never in any circumstances work well.  It will be seenthat the two cases, although there are several points of  contact between them, are really distinct.   3. As to the first charge, i.e., that the present system is working badly, I suggestthat it has been rebutted by the evidence.  It has not been contradicted that our naval air  work  is  better than the  Naval air work of any other  Great  Power.Admiral Phillimore&apos;s contention, based upon newspaper reports, that the american naval Air  Service is  better than ours is refuted by the  admitted fact that incarrier work  we are  far ahead of them.  It  has  not  been contradicted, paceGeneral Ironside, that the  Navy is  receiving the pick of aircraft material andthat  the  aircraft equipment has  been  ready before  the carriers are actuallycompleted.   It  has not been  contradicted  that the  Air Ministry are anxiousto study the wishes of the Admiralty both in the provision of material and theallocation of  personnel. Admiral de  Robecks correspondence with the Air OfficerCommanding in the  Mediterranean   as  to the  relation  of  the R.A.F. to  theNaval Commander-in-Chief may seem to  controvert this  statement.-  In pointof fact, the Air Ministry as soon as  it  received the report  of  the Air  Officerexpressed  its agreement with practically every claim  that Admiral  de Robeckput  forward, and forwarded the  correspondence to  the Admiralty.  It will,therefore, be seen that the matter was amicably settled without any suggestion fromthe Admiralty as soon as it was brought to the notice of the Air Ministry   As to whether  there is overlapping  between Naval and Air Force personnel on board carriers, the evidence inclines me to think that, whilst generally speakingno great economies can be  effected without  loss of  efficiency, there is room forcertain reductions by mutual arrangement.                     ,,    Mutual arrangement  also  could easily  remove  any  deficiencies  that  haveemerged during the  enquiry in the matter of liaison between the two Services.      [10003]  [10414]
    Even Captain Calvert,  the  Admiralty  witness  from  the Aircraft Carrier&quot; Pegasus,&quot; appeared to admit that the present system was working as satisfactorilyas a dual system * could work.  I do not go as far as to make this claim.  I wouldrather content myself with saying that,  judged by results, the present system is working satisfactorily, and that, given the removal of  any small deficiencies  that have  been  disclosed in the evidence, and the  existence of goodwill  upon  bothsides, the system could be made to work better.    I suggest, therefore, that the Admiralty have established  no case against thepresent system upon the ground of administrative deficiencies.    4. I gather, however, from  the evidence that even  if  they have  not establishedthis first case, they still press the  second  case, namely, that a system, whether itworks well or whether it works badly, that leaves the Air personnel  in the naval units under the Air  Ministry, is intolerable.   Upon  this  broad  question themembers of  the  Sub-Committee must  weigh  the various  arguments.  Whichsystem  will produce  the best  Navy ?  Whioh  system  will produce the best AirForce ?   What kind of war, Air  or  Naval,  is  most  likely ?   If the Navy cannot have its way without injuring the Air Force,  or the Air Force without injuring theNavy, is there any practical compromise ?    5. Into  these and  other cognate questions I  do not wish to go.  I  desire only toemphasise the one- cardinal fact  that seems to me to have  emerged  from theenquiry  in  this  connection.   There must,  as  Lord Weir  has already suggested,either be a  point of contact between the  Na,vy and the Air  Force, or  each must  be completely, separate from  the  other.   If there is  a point  of contact, there must inevitably be some friction between  the two  Services. At present the point  of contact  is placed on  the  Admiral&apos;s  operational control of the Air Units in his command.   If it is lowered against the Air Ministry and  the circle of  Naval controldrawn  to include flying personnel, it will  come to  be fixed upon  the province of  material.   I suggest  that  the removal of the  point of contact  from thecircle of personnel to the circle  of  material will not  eradicate friction for thepresent  or make  friction  less  likely in  the  future.   The aeroplane, as a greatfighting unit, is the sole reason for the existence of the Air Force.   Is it conceiv-able  that, whatever may be the paper  arrangements as to the supply of  material,one great Service&apos;will allow the design  and the production of  this fighting unit toremain  in the control of  another ?   It  is  significant  to  note that this  actualcontingency  has arisen in France, where the  Military Aviation  authorities aremaking  every effort to extract  research, production and  supply from  the  Ministryof Aviation.   Indeed,  it is scarcely necessary to argue the  point.   For  Admiralsde Robeck, Phillimore and Fisher insisted  categorically upon a separation of theNaval arm, as complete in the matter of material as in the matter  of personnel,and the First Lord  of the Admiralty, having stated  that the Admiralty could produce their own material, admitted that a  common supply service would only  beaccepted  by the  Navy, as a pis aller.  Moreover,  as  Lord Weir   has pointedout,T the Admiralty  have themselves frequently stated with  reference to the amalgamation of the common services  that  any form of  technical supply  by another service  is quite  impossible,  and  the Naval  Staff,  Director of  naval construction  and Engineer-in-Chief  have  put. the  naval  position beyond anyshadow of doubt in their paper (N.D. (R) 9) in which they elaborate the principlesthat      (1.J The user of material must have  absolute control over design  and quality           of that material.     (2.) The responsibility of the user of material for its design and quality must           be  clearly  established and maintained throughout  the  process  of           production.     Is  it conceivable with the  Naval representatives  holding  these views thatwhen the point of contact has been moved  from  personnel to material there willnot be  the most acute friction  upon the first occasion  that a Naval  airman is killed in an accident in  an Air-Ministry-biiilt machine ?   I ask the attention of membersof the Sub-Committee to the evidence thats Sir Geoffrey  Salmond, the Air Member    * See N.D. (K) 7t!h Meeting, 58 and 221.    t See NT.D. (K) 5th Meeting,  335.  The Admiralty expressed the same view very definitely when  theproposal for a Ministry of Supply was under consideration (0. P. 616, January 1920).
for Supply and Research, gave in this connection, and to the &quot; Admiralty proposalsfor the organisation of its supply of air material&quot; N.D. (R) 9.   6. If this is the case, and if the object of a change is to remove friction, the only course is to eliminate altogether the point of  contact, and to set up a Naval Air:organisation, with its own personnel, its own reserve, its own training and its&apos;ownmaterial, completely independent of the Air Ministry.  Whether the experience ofthe war would justify such  a change, and whether the  finances  of the  country would stand it, are  questions for the members of the Sub-Committee to decide.It should, however,  be noted that if the Navy went back to the  organisation of theR.N.A.S. it would be difficult to  resist the claim of  the Army to return to theorganisation  of the R.F.C., and that when once the auxiliary arm idea of the AirForce has been re-admitted, it will be almost impossible  to maintain side by sidethe idea of the Air Force as a primary Service and a distinct profession.  Be this,however, as it may,  the conclusion seems  to me to emerge from the evidence thatthere is  no half-way house.  Either the  Navy must  be  completely independent and self-supporting  in the matter of  its Air units, or there must  remain a pointof contact between  the Admiralty and the Air Ministry.   The point of contact,wherever it may  be placed,  may excite friction.  To remove it  from personnel to mat&amp;iel is only to change its  place  and incidentally  to break up the unity ofair training and strategy.   The Chief of, the Air Staff and I agree that if a change is to be made, mereshifting of the point of contact will  do no good, and  we state definitely that if achange is to be made, the only real alternative to the  present system is a clean cut.   7. I hope, therefore, that the members of the Sub-Committee will direct their attention to the clear issue between a clean cut and the possibility  of improvementwithin the present position.  My own view is that a clean cut would be very expen siveand would, in spite of Admiral de Robeck&apos;s arguments  in favour of it, mutilate airstrategy and air development, and that upon the whole the  existing point of contactis better placed than anywhere else.  Let the point of contact, therefore, remainwhere it is.   If it is once moved, it will not eliminate friction, and it will  tend to vary like the needle of a  thermometer according as  to whether Admiralty or AirMinistry stock is rising or falling.  But if  it is  left  where it is, it is still possiblegreatly to improve the atmosphere upon both sides of it.   8. Assuming, therefore, that the point of contact remains where it is, I am prepared to make the following proposals with the purpose of reducing friction toa minimum:    (1.) The Admiralty will demand what they require from the Air Ministry, and         the Air Ministry will provide it.   (2.) The Admiralty will include the money to  cover the demand in Naval          estimates as a grant-in-aid to Air Votes.  The Air Ministry regards         this arrangement  as clumsy  and difficult  from the point  of view of         finance and  administration, and  it  only makes  the offer because it         understands that the Admiralty attaches importance to it.   (3.) After initial training in airmanship by the  Air  Ministry, units will  be          allocated to the Navy and trained  by the  Coastal Area  in Naval work          and employed under the  Commanders-in-Chiefs, the units being at all         times and in all respects under their absolute orders.   (4.) The  personnel  of air units allocated to the Navy shall, be left with the          Navy for definite periods  of years; this personnel shall include a large          number  of  seconded  Naval   Officers.   The   Air  Force  will  accept          seconded Naval Officers to the number of  30 per cent, of the officers in          Naval units.  The short service officers will be definitely appointed to          the Naval Air side for  the whole of their service and the seconded          Naval Officers will serve  all their  time in Naval Air units unless, with         Admiralty concurrence, they are needed  for research or instructional          work. . The Admiralty will be  consulted  in the selection of all senior          R.A.F. Officers for service on board carriers.          The Air  Ministry will be prepared to consider favourably applications          from the Admiralty to transfer from time to,time Naval Officers  of          sufficient air experience to the R.A.F.   (5.) All obscurities  and anomalies  that may  still   remain in the field  of          discipline will be removed.
    (6.) All confidential reports of R.A.F. Officers serving with the Navy will %           signed by the  Captain of the  ship  and  passed through the Naval           Commander-in-chief to the A.O.C. Coastal area.    (7.) The liaison between the two Departments and Services will be strengthened           in every possible way.    9. Finally, let me say that it is to secondment, given that it is carried out upona sufficiently extensive scale, that I particularly look for a solution of  many of thedifficulties that now seem to loom so large.  If a third of the officers  in the naval units were seconded Naval officers, the sea  sense, to which  the Admiralty attachesso great importance, would have a  full and generous  scope for its  activities,Moreover,  if the remaining  officers  were Air officers, the air sense also wouldhave free  play.  By secondment, I do not. mean the grudging intrusion of a fewofficers, whose careers in their own Service will be uncertain, but a constant influx of officers of all ranks into every branch of the Air  Service  for which  they have adequate qualifications, and an influx stimulated by the Admiralty and welcomed by the Air Ministry.  Such  an influx would impregnate  the Air Ministry  with first-hand Naval knowledge and experience,  just as it would suffuse the Navy fromtop to  bottom with  the knowledge  of air and  its special  problems.   nothing would be more regrettable than that the two Services  should be ignorant of  eachother&apos;s problems, difficulties and capabilities.  Indeed, no part of the Admiralty&apos;!case impressed me so much as the suggestion that the system led to ignorance ofthe air  and indifference to its potentialities  on the part of senior Naval officers.This ignorance can be removed, and should  be removed, not by the isolation of theNaval units from the  broad field of air development, but by the regular secondmentof Naval Officers, junior and senior,  to the Air  Force for training and work withwith  the fleet, for administrative co-operation  with the Air Ministry, and for, infact, any air work for  which they have the requisite aptitudes.    10.  I  trust that, whatever may  be the decision of the Committee and of theCabinet, it will be loyally accepted by both  services, and that an early opportunitjwill  be taken  to circulate to  R.N.  and  R.A.F. officers  an agreed &quot;Weekly Orderexplaining fully what the arrangements  for the future are to be.  I consider thiscourse to be essential if  the many misconceptions which at present exist are to be finally removed.                                                             S. EL,                                                  Secretary of State for Air.    Air Ministry, June 1, 1923.
