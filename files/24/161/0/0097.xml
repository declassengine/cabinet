[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, &quot;jg   9               Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1923.SECRET.O.P. 397 (23).CABINET.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.PUBLICITY  ARRANGEMENTS.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IN the course of the preliminary correspondence as to the Imperial conference the Prime Ministers both of Canada and Australia have indicated the view that asmuch publicity should be given to the proceedings of the Conference as is compatible with the necessity for secrecy on questions such as foreign policy or the details ofnaval, military and  air  co-operation.   An  important  aspect of the question ispublicity  while the Conference is in session, and I think that it is advisable to con-sider in advance what measures for securing such publicity of this kind as is possible should be recommended to the Conference by the representatives  of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  I understand that in previous years the practice has been to issue dailycommuniques, sometimes stating only that a meeting has been held, sometimes giving a brief outline of  the  subjects discussed.  These  were supplemented in 1921  by(a) verbatim reports of certain discussions given to the press, in  the course of theproceedings, at the wish of the Conference; (b) a summarised report of the discussions as a whole, drawn up for, and approved by, the Conference before it separated, andsubsequently published.    I do  not suggest that the procedure set out above should be  abandoned, but Ithink that it might usefully be expanded.  There seem to me great  advantages in arranging that press correspondents should be able to go to some specified person or persons to  get what I may call  the  &quot; atmosphere &quot; of the  Conference  and anyparticulars which could safely be  communicated and are likely to prove of interestto the newspapers here and overseas.   I also think that such an arrangement would do much to obviate the unauthorised &quot; leakage &quot; of information which I gather hascharacterised some of the  previous Conferences.    I suggest that  a British Minister, preferably  one ^without  departmental responsibilities, might be  made generally responsible for the publicity arrangements and, in particular, deputed to attend the meetings (or, at any rate, all the importantmeetings)  of the Imperial Conference,  not as a representative of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, but with a &quot; watching brief.&apos;&apos;  At the end of each meeting this minister should have discretion, subject to  any  specific ruling  from the Conference, and any necessary discussion with the Prime Minister as President,  to settle the line to betaken as regards the press.    If this is agreed to, the further  question arises as to the actual channel ofcommunication with the press.    On this, my view would be that  the Minister holding the &quot; watching brief &quot;should not himself, unless some special reason arose, interview press correspondents.    It would be better, I think, to use the existing machinery, viz., the services ofthe  publicity officer of the Colonial Office, Mr. Caird, and,  where foreign affairs areconcerned, of the publicity officer of the Foreign Office, Sir A. Willert, in association with Mr.  Caird.   These officers have long experience  in dealing  with  press correspondents, and are in a position to know who can be trusted,  and how far it iswise to go.  It would then only be necessary for the Minister concerned to  have a      [10547]
talk to Mr. Caird (andt if necessary, Sir A. Willert), say, twice a day, once in the morning to indicate the &quot; programme,&quot; and again later in the day to let them knowany results of the meetings which could properly be  communicated to the press.     These officers would then be able to make their own arrangements for meetingthe pi ess correspondents; probably it would be well to lay down      (a.)  That, if any information were being given to the press by Sir A.  Willert on         .  foreign affairs questions arising out of the Conference, Mr. Caird should           be present at the interviews  so that he would know what line was being           taken.     (&amp;.)  That the interviews  with Mr.  Caird should take place lat specified times           and at a specified office, preferably,  I  think,  at the Colonial Office or           whatever other Department was entrusted with  the task of  actually           issuing the official communiques.     I understand that the President of the Board of Trade has now under considera-tion the  publicity  arrangements for the Imperial Economic Conference;  possibly itmight be well to deal with the work of both  Conferences by means of the machinery Ihave outlined above if it would not involve too great a strain on the Minister holdingthe &quot; watching brief &quot; to be called upon to attend  the important meetings of bothConferences.    I should add that, if the arrangements outlined  above  are approved by theCabinet, it would be advisable, at the outset of the Conference, to explain what issuggested to the  representatives  of the Dominions and India,  and, if the plan isgenerally approved, to use every endeavour to arrange that they themselves  utilisethe organisation suggested.   This would  involve  (a) instructions to  their ownPublicity Officers  (if any) to refer all press enquiries on Conference subjects toMr. Caird, or (&amp;) the presence  of  these officers at the daily  interviews with theMinister in charge, or possibly a combination of both these methods.                                                             DEVONSHIRE.    September 3, 1923.
