The Committee on Unemployment are of opinion     that serious unemployment must he:anticipated throughout the     coining winter and that it is essential that arrangements he     made for the provision of assisted works on a scale at least     as great as was the case last winter.A,              The following paragraphs give an estimate     of the amount of such works which will he in progress under     authority already obtained.     (1) Ministry cf Transport.               Work on the road3 on Unemployment Schemes will     be provided in the course of the current financial year for     an average number of noarly 27,000 men.   An average number     of 4,800 of these men will be employed in or near the black     spot areas.   Indirectly a sum of over  2,000,000 will it is    - estimated also be spent in wages but as this cannot be     apportioned between skilled and unskilled labour the number     of men employed cannot be stated.               The total cost of these works for the year will be     approximately  7,500,000 of which  4,300,000 will be found     by the Ministry of Transport,
I(2) Unemployment  Grants  Committees          It is estimated that  of the  schemes  for which grants have already been promised works  of a total value  of 850,000 will be carried out.in the  coming winter and will afford 33,000 man months of direct employment  apart from employment Indirectly involved  in the  provision of materials *Approximately 12,000 of  these man months will  be provided inor near the black spot areas.          The cost to the State of completing  these schemes will be under  400,000 spread over a period cf 16 years.(3) Aoeeloration . of programmes  of;Government Departments *          Nil.

This numberit is estimated will increase generally  (in the absence ofspecial reasons such as  trade disputes to the  contrary) throughthe winter, the maximum  number  to be employed  being possibly     *    Tho total cost  to  tho State  of all the  30,000,000worth of schemes  hitherto approved  is  as followsLoanssanctioned.Annual Charges on Exchequer in respect  of192219231924 to19271928 to19321933 to193830,000,000400,000j  950,000 __i_1,250,0001,070,000.I  380,000 _i____
as high as 50,000.          In fact, and allowing for indirect employment,it is estimated that the number of men actually employed through-the scheme is double the number returned.(?)

The total value of the schemes guaranteed under  theTrade Facilities Act is  26,000^000 leaving a marginalauthority to guarantee further.schemes amounting to  24,000,000.          The scheme expires in November, but the intentionof the Government to extend it has already been    announced.(7) Export Credit3,,Scheme .          The total value of advances, guarantees and cfceditssanctioned under this scheme is approximately  14,000,000leaving a marginal authority to gaarantee further schemesamounting to  12.,000,000.          It is estimated that further credit a to the value of 750,000 will be sanctioned to operate in the coming winteraffording 28,000 man months of&apos;employment apart fromtransport, clerical workers, etc.          The question of a widening of the powers under thisscheme Is receiving consideration.                          w 3 **
          The following proposals for new or extended schemesfor relief work have been under consideration.(1&apos; Mintstry of Transport.          Tho only scheme under active consideration forwhich no provision is made in the existing Road Fund, pro-gramme is the Has go ^-Edinburgh road.   Of this the portionnearest Glasgow might be put in hand, this winter at a totalcost of somewhere in the neighbourhood of a million for one half  of &quot;sihich Government assistance would be required.   if local authorities are, as Is now proposed, stimulated to forward new schemes for black spot areas to provide employ-ment in the winter months a considerable number may bosubmitted, especially if unemployment Increases.   It was estimated that Road Fund resources were fully pledgedunder the last programme and It is uncertain what margin willbs available.   Before therefore new commitments can be entered into it vrf.ll be necessary to consider from whatsources assistance will be available and for this purpose to review the extent to vvhich the Road Fund can be furthercommitted.2. Unem.ployment,Grants Committee.    (a)   vJlth the sanction of the Government circular lettershave been issued inviting local authorities to submit proposalsfor undertaking grant-aided relief works to be undertaken inthe coining winter.          Full information la not at present available, but Itis estimated that proposals for suitable works to a total valueof at least  10,000,000 vri.ll be submitted.   Works  to thisvalue would give some 365,000 man months of employment from october 1923 to April 1924.   The cost  to the State may beestimated at  4,375,000 payable by way of annual charges as under
Loans sanctioned 5,000,000 N.K. 5,000,000 Re?.

The Committee are, however, definitelyof opinion that the latter class of scheme  should bo encouragedand assisted to the utmost.   Tills course will have theincidental advantage of reducing the charge falling on the State,     (b)  It is difficult to estimate the results of thedecision that grants shall be made available to private companies undertaking the same duties as local authorities.The applications may be numerous or on tha other hand mayconceivably come to very little.   For the present purpose itis assumed  that the applications will cover schemes equal in amount to those anticipated from local authorities and a sumof  5,000,000 is therefore taken to be the amount of schemes the assistance of which the State should at the present stagecontemplate;.        The cost to the State is estimated at  2,020,000 made up as followsAmount of SchemeAnnual charge on Exchequer..5,000,0001924-505,0001925-6135,000
    (c)    Besides the sum of  194,000 already available itis estimated that a further  100,000 will be required to paygrants on the 60% of&quot; wages basis for works constructed out ofrevenue and not by loan.,   A total of nearly  1,000,000 worth of work should be attained by aid of these grants.   No furthermoney will be required: before next year and indeed some of theexisting  194,000 may be surrendered and require to be revotod.(3) Acceleration of, Gioyernmont wo^ks..    (a)   Office of Works          A very large amount of acceleration of maintenance work was undertaken last winter, and the work that could nowbe accelerated would mainly involve the employment of buildingtrades operatives.   In these circumstances no proposals are submitted.    (b)   Post Offioe.          (i) Trunk telephone, cable laying.    Employmentcould be found for 25,000 man months,, 80$ of the work to be&apos;completed by&apos;S1st March, 1924.   Estimated cost  588,000,which can be provided under the borrowing powers possessed bythe Post Office under the Telegraph Money Acts.          (ii) Post Office (London) Railway Employment for900 unskilled men for 12 months could be found by the completionof this railway, which would tend, to reduce the congestion of street traffic.   A large amount of skilled work andexpenditure on materials&apos;would also be involved.          Estimated cost - say  500,000.    (c)   War Office.          A Committee is considering possibilities.    (d)   Admiralty.          The Admiralty if authorised could place orders in anticipation of requirements for 1924-25 to the extent of
approximately  500*000 nearly all of which would be spent inBarrow and other black spot areas;    (e)  Air Ministry          Are&apos;vprocQedIng as rapidly as possible with worksalready provided for but cannot give any particulars bearing on the reduction of unemployment.    (f)  Colonial Office          The Colonial Office have submitted to us schemesfor the development of Nyasaland and&apos;Tanganyika,   these colonies are grant-aided and are at present at any rate unableto contribute to the cost of the works.  &apos; All of them arein a position in which orders can be placed immediately.        j  A further memorandum is being prepared as to certainrailway extensions,&apos; which it is hoped to circulate as anaddendum to this report.   Meanwhile the. Conni11ee&quot;^otto^ffao2,proposals,          (a) to construct two steamers for use on Lakes      - Nyasa and Tanganyika at a oost of  35,000 a piece.          (b) to undertake the extension of the Lindi       tramway at a cost of  50,000.   The latter proposal       is strongly supported by the Empire Cotton Growing       Association.          The Committee understand that financial assistanceto these Colonies-should take:the form&quot;of loans free ofinterest, or free, of Interest-for a time, &quot;and that the detailsof the .loans .can-be-settled between the Treasury and theColonial Office.    (g)   Scottish Office          Scottish Departments can, if authorised, anticipateworks as follows:-
          Prison Commission.   Central heating at the newEdinburgh Prison Including 2 boilers and iron piping .... 4,000          This heating would normally come on nestyear&apos;s estimate,          Central heating at Barlimiie prison to. replaceworn out apparatus.   Additional boiler, and piping ...... 3,000.(4)  Agricultural Works,.    (a)   The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries recommendsthe allocation to his department of a sum of . 350,000 to be expended as follows;-   300,000 in. assisting land, drainageand water supply works (similar to those assisted last winter)in England and Wales, and  50,000 in promoting the chalkingand liming of land (land improvement).   Of this sum  240,000would be required in the current financial year.   The estimatedamount of employment to be provided, based on last year&apos;s figures, is estimated at 52,000 man months.   It is estimatedthat  36,000&apos; will be recovered from the drainage Boards.          The sum expended last winter on land drainage wasabout  300,000.     (b)   The Secretary for Scotland recommends theallocation to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland of asum of  63,000 to be expended in assisting works ofland drainage and improvement on the same lines as last winter.   It is estimated that employment.for 5,000 men would.be provided for an average period of 3 months.   Theamount is the same as was allocated for this purpose last winter.(5)  Forestry.          The Forestry Commissioners propose- &amp; -
    (a)   an increase of their normal programme of plantingand preparation to the extent of 24,000 man weeks.   Cost 38,500.    (b)   A scheme for the clearance of scrub areas, 2,000man weeks.   These works should be self-supporting andarrangements could be made for the cutting and sale atdepots in large towns of the lirewood so cleared;    (c)   additional work in Crown woods, 7,000 man weeks.Cost  11,000.    (d)   Grant aided afforestation works of corporations and private individuals on the lines adopted last winter.50,000 man weeks.   Cost  65,000.          Tho cost to the State of the special unemploymentwork undertaken by the Commissioners last winter was 100,000,          The preceding paragraphs may be summarised intabular form as follows -

          S?-S. PSF^iSS-Ef^PH^SPSjL  ^-at subject to moneybeing available the whole of these new proposals headopted by the Cabinet.          In the event of the cost so entailed being greaterthan can be admitted the^ Committee^ recommend that theproposals should be considered xn tho following order of priority..     Unemployment Grants Committee.     Admiralty.     Colon!al Office.     Post Office.     Agricultural Works.     Forestry.     Scottish Office (Advancement of works).          The Committee^ further recommend that in view ofthe: possibility-of an extension of unemployment in thecoming winter, even more serious than has up to. the presentbeen contemplated, the Departments should be instructedto prepare schemes for the provision of further assistedemployment.   If further action should become necessaryit will ba essential that tho time occupied in theconsideration and actual initiation of such schemes shouldbe minimized.  &apos;(1)       The Committee have considered certain other proposals for the acceleration of works in this country inconnoction especially with a  letter received by the PrimeMinister from the Industrial Group of members of the Houseof Commons.
          They observe that in spite of the pressure broughtto bear during the past two years but little is being done by.the Railway Companies in the electrification and  re-conditioning of the Railways,   The necessary statutory powers for extension works of electrification are already inthe possession of the Companies.          In view of the financial position of the Companies, .and of the fact that electrification works should - as stated bythe Industrial Group -be &quot;extremely remunerative&quot; the Committeeare not at the present stage prepared to recommend that any financial inducement to proceed should be offered by the state to the Companies but they recommend that the Prime minister should confer with the Companies&apos; representatives and endeavour to induce them to proceed.(2)       The Committee are impressed with tho importance from every point of view of rapid and substantial extensionof the Indian railway system.  They recommend that theSecretary of State should, be requested to supplement thotelegram addressed to India,as to the Dominions on theq\i.estion of Colonial Development by a private telegram to theVac eroy pointing out the urgency of the placing as early aspossible of Large orders in this country.(3)       The Committee understand that the placing of contracts for the Port of London Extension is being delayed \.by a difficulty as to labour conditions.   Although theAuthority has already pledged itself to accept the conditionsusually attached to works assisted by the Unemployment GrantsCommittee (employment of ox-service men, employment oflabour locally etc.) some questions are apparently being      mraised by possible contractors and tho Committee have reason
to suppose that in somo quarters the importation of gangs of irish labour for thie work is in contemplation,          Tho Committee attach great importance to the engagement of local  (London) labour for  this work.  they recommend that conditions securing the employment of a proper proportion of this labour be insisted upon, andthat if the need should ariso, it should be dejf&amp;aifcolystated to the Authority that the prorniso of assistance madeby&apos; the Government must be withdrawn if there is anyimportation to London of Irish labour.Philip Lloyd Greama.*   Chairman:.H.VY.S i Francis  )  JointQ.W.G.
