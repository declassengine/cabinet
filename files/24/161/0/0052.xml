IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITJjttNIO- MAJESTY&apos; S .WVSIRHMBMT.SEOETL.                                                    COPY HO.g,P. 352C A B I I I I.                    SMOKE ABATEMENT (SCOTLAND)BILL.               mmmmm BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAKD.                  I circulate with this note,  for the information off0       my colleagues,  a draft Smoke Abatement (Scotland)  Bill  whichllow).   has been  prepared after consultation with Scottish local        authorities.   I had hoped to take advantage of the English        Bill to effect the necessary legislation,  but the  form  of the        Bill did not  lend itself to an application to Scotland.    The        introduction  of the English Bill makes it important that the        Scottish Bill should be introduced if possible before  the        Recess and unless I hear by 11 a.m.,  Tuesday next, that  any        of my colleagues dissents,  I propose  to introduce  it in  the        House of Lords.                  Clause 1 of the Bill aims  at superseding by a  single        enactment the law presertiyscattered  through various Acts.        The provisions as respect smoke nuisance in the Public  Health        (Scotland)  Act, 1897,. are defective  in that the cnus is  upon        the person alleging that the best practicable means of        preventing the issue of siroke have not been used;   and        prosecutions  under the Smoke. Abatement Acts are rare.    The        Clause, generally speaking, applies  to the whole oountry the        provisions  which have been in force  in Burghs, under which        the onus is upon the person charged.   A more drastic penalty        clause and, an extended definition of &quot;smoke&quot; have  been        added,- along  with a qualification of &quot;the best practicable        means of preventing smoke&quot; by the words &quot;(having regard  to the        cost)&quot; both of these provisions being contained in the        English Bill,                  The list of exemptions contained in the  relative        provision of  the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892, is        incorporated  in Clause 6 and extended by the addition  of the        processes referred to in Clause 1 (l)  (e)  cf the English        Bill, with corresponding power to the Scottish Board of        Health to extend the list by Order subject to approval  by        Resolution of both Houses of Parliament.   Steam boilers        at Mines have been excepted from exemption on advice that        there is no excuse for smoke in that case.                  Clauses 3, 4, and 5 give powers, similar to those        conferred by  the English Bill, to the central authority in        regard to the application of Section  7 of the Alkali, etc.,        Works Regulation Act, 1906, and to local authorities in        regard to new buildings (other than  dwelling houses) and        in regard to  combination for the purposes  of the Bill.&quot;JTOVAR&apos;Scottish Office,   Whitehall,  s.W.1.28th July,  1923.
