(Memorandum hy the financial Seoretary to the Treasury).              In February 1919, three months after the Armistice    the Admiralty obtained a decision from the V/ar Cabinet that    a War Reserve of Fuel Oil should be accumulated at Home up    to 4-1- million tons,  stated to&quot;be IE months consumption of    the Post War Fleet as then contemplated by the naval staff,              This accumulation has been proceeding ever since    at very great expense for Oil Fuel and Storage Tanks and    the completed storage in March last was 2j457,560 tons*              Subsequently the Admiralty developed plans for    Oil Fuel Storage in the Far East and on the route to the    Far last:  and as the Cabinet are aware this scheme is    being pressed on with a view to completion in 1931 in view    of the Admiralty^ anxiety as to the naval situation in    the Pacific,                                   \              This programme does not complete the Admiralty:s    oil storage schemes,  as there, are further schemes (at  :    present in abeyance)  for Oil Fuel Storage on the  Western    route and for commercial use,.              I venture to think that the time has  come when    the Home Oil Fuel Storage scheme should be reconsidered,,.    There is now at  Home  storage and Oil for over 6 months1    Consumption of the Post  War Fleet,  even if the  figure  of    consumption be taken  at  the same amount as before  the    Washington reductions  of  the  Fleet,    There  is  no  reason    to  suppose that  except  in the  event  of a War with  the    United States  of  America  there could be any  serious    difficulty in  obtaining Oil Fuel:   and immediate hostilities    with  the  United  Star.es of America are  surely not a    believable supposition.;    In the event  of hostilities with    any European Power or with Turkey,  it  seems doubtful .                              1 r*
T4AUG.1923whether the Home reserve would be expended;   while theevent of war with Japan is being provided for in a separate and very expensive schemae          It may be objected that in the event of war, the oil producers would ask a very high price for Oil Fuel.But even so. if the cost of storage and of Reserve Oil Fuelbe reckoned at; copioqu-nd An^e r Q &amp;t over a long term of years,as would be required in order to make a correct comparison,the true cost might probably prove very much higher on themethod of accumulation during peace than if purchases weremade under wax conditions.   When the scheme is completeth&amp;^oost in interest on tho value of oil in stock will amount tou about   ljOOOtOO0 per annum*          Nobody - least cf all myself - wishes toimmobilise the British Fleet by inadequate supplies of oil fuel, but in this matter it seems to me that, havingaccumulated 6 months&apos; stock, we are taking unneoeasaryprecautions at extravagant cost in acquiring a aOeoad6 months&apos; supply,          1 suggest therefore that the Home Reserve of oil fuel be fixed at 6 months Fleet requirements and no furtherstorage or oil fuel purchased on that account,   Thiswould enable certain savings to be made on Oil Fuel Storage,schemes in Groat Britain at present on the JStavy JJstiiaatea^.&apos;                                   WCJ-H*
