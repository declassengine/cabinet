t) w 0[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.!                      Printed for the Cabinet.    July 1923.SECRET.CP. 364(23).                                  CABINET.Army in India. Retention of a British Cavalry Regiment.               MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY AF STATE FOR INDIA.    I am sorry that this question has to be brought  before  the Cabinet again.  but when the discussion which  the Cabinet directed regarding the incidence of cost tookplace between the Secretary of State for War, the Financial Secretary to the treasury and myself, it appeared that  the Financial Secretary objected to bearing, any part  ofthe cost, not-or only incidentally on financial,, but  on constitutional, grounds ;. and only the Cabinet can deal with the constitutional question.    The Financial Secretary has stated his case in  the memorandum which he^ hascirculated, but he has stated its constitutional aspect only in part.  I fully recognisethat  it is open to the  Cabinet  to impose  any garrison it pleases on India.  Butthis  cannot   be  done without expenditure  of Indian  revenues,  and the control  ofIndian revenues is by statute vested not in the Cabinet but in the  Secretary of state in Council..   The  Cabinet have  therefore  to find  a  Secretary  of State who will undertake to persuade his Council, and the Secretary of  State has to find a  Councilsufficiently amenable to  obey.  I will not labour  this point, but it has an  obviousbearing on the Financial Secretary&apos;s argument.    I turn  now from high constitutional theory to its practical application.   My col-leagues are aware that since the war there has been no more burning question in Indiathan this question of the control of the Army in India  by the Home Government.   free expression has been given in  the Legislative Assembly and  elsewhere to the suspicion that the Home Government insist  on maintaining in India at Indian expense an armylarger than India requires for her  own purposes, and  that the Commander-in-Chief inIndia and the Government of India are constantly overruled by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment for  imperial purposes  on the advice  of the  Imperial General Staff.  It was largely for the purpose of  dispelling this suspicion  that my predecessor asked thelate Government to refer  the whole question  of Indian military requirements  to theCommittee of Imperial Defence, and my colleagues will remember  that  they recently approved  the report of that  Committee.   The report  clearly  recognises both theimperial and  the local aspects of Indian defence.  It  lays down, in  a passage quoted by the Financial Secretary,  that on questions of imperial  strategy the  constitutionaladviser of the  Secretary of  State is the Chief of the Imperial  General Staff.  Asregards local  strategy, it lays  down that it is the duty of India to provide for her own defence against external and internal dangers in all  but the gravest emergencies, butit indicates that in these  local questions  the constitutional advisers  of  the Secretaryof State are  the Indian military authorities  and the Government of India.   I thinkit is essential that these two aspects of Indian defence should be clearly distinguished,and that  the  decision of  the Cabinet on any Indian military question should be basedon this distinction.  I take my stand on the principle that if  the Commander-in-chief in India and  the Government of India can convince the Secretary of State for india on any question of local Indian defence, he is entitled to claim that his  advice to theCabinet shall not be over-ruled by that of any other military authority.  And  that isthe Cabinet&apos;s safe-guard  against the danger which the  Financial Secretary fears, thatit you give way to India over  one  cavalry  regiment she may come  up next year and demand to be relieved of  the cost of five.    She  may;  but she  will  have  first  to convince  the Secretary of State, one of your  own colleagues and equally responsiblewith yourselves to Parliament.    Now as regards the,immediate cause of the present discussion, the applicationof this principle is made less easy  because  there appears  to  be  some doubt as to thepurpose for which the retention of  this third cavalry regiment is demanded.  I havealready explained at an earlier stage that it does not form part of the troops allotted to the internal defence  of India.  It belongs to  one of two  fragmentary reservebrigades  of the  field army, and the proposal  of the Commander-in-Chief is to form     6575    100  7.23
one complete  and serviceable  brigade in their  place.  By so doing he renders thiscavalry regiment surplus to the requirements of the field army.  I have accepted his advice and that of the Government of India on this point as  sound, and so far  as thelocal defence of India is concerned my own advice to the Cabinet is that the regimentis not required.   But  the  question  has its  imperial  aspect as  well.  Among themilitary commitments of Great  Britain is admittedly that of supplying India withreinforcements in certain emergencies, and in  order to supply them it is necessary tomaintain certain reserves.  The Chief of  the  Imperial  General  Staff has convincedme that for  the  maintenance  of  these reserves  the  retention  of  the  cavalry regiment is necessary, and I have accordingly informed the Government of India thatthis, and this alone, is the ground on which I have felt obliged to resist their repeateddemand for the withdrawal of the regiment.    I must point out to my colleagues that there is nothing contrary to this in the memorandum of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff which has been circulated to them.   In this memorandum the GeneralStaff stated that they did not like any of the reductions; but they acquiesced in the mall-which  they could  hardly have done if they had thought that  the safety of india was involved.  At the same time they made the proviso  that half of the cost of thethird  cavalry  regiment  (75,0001.)  should be borne  by  India.  They thus admitted,what  I am Mailing  to  concede, that there is an element of doubt in determining whether the maintenance of the regiment in India is required for  wholly Imperial orwholly Indian purposes.  I have, therefore, accepted  the proviso because it seems tome fairly to offer  a monetary adjustment of the doubt, which I have indicated.  It has never been  admitted to  be  an Indian responsibility  to contribute to the cost of the reserves which Great Britain maintains as the price of  the benefit which she obtainsfrom  the  possession of  an  Empire, and it, should be clearly understood that I do not admit any such responsibility now.  But since there is a doubt as to  whether it is forImperial  or Indian purposes that  the  maintenance in  India of this regiment  isnecessary, I am content that the parties  should share the cost.                                                                         PEEL.    30th July  1923.
