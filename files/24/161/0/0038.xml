IT  is now seven weeks since the  German  Government,  in  their note  of  the 7th June, submitted to the Powers fresh proposals  for settling  the problem of repara- tions.   The  main  points in the  note  were three : (1) A proposal to  submit to an impartial international  tribunal the question  of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay, coupled with an  undertaking to  accept  any decision so reached as regards  both the amount- Mid the  mode  of payment; (2)  the assignment  of certain  specified  guarantees as securities for payment; and (3)  the summoning of a conference  in  order to work  out , detailed scheme.    His Majesty&apos;s Government were  from the start of opinion that, whether these proposals were  adequate  or not, they marked a sufficient advance  to justify careful consideration with a view to the return of a collective  reply.   This view  was concurred in by the Italian Government; but the French and the Belgian Governments expressed the view that, only after passive resistance had been definitely abandoned by Germany, would it be possible  to enter into communication  with  her.   In their  anxiety to ascertain the precise meaning to  be attached to this condition  a  number of questions were addressed to the French and  Belgian Governments by His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard both to the action which the German Government was invited to take, and to the future position in  the Ruhr, if and  when  it  should  have  been taken.  The eplies that have been returned to these questions  have not completely lifted the veil of uncertainty in which the situation is still in parts involved.   In  the meantime, the  question of reparations remains in  suspense,  and,  while reasons for inaction or for refusal to take any action but that which  commends itself to this or that  Power abound, the international situation becomes weekly, and  indeed daily,  more  acute; the  occupation  of the  Ruhr,  whether justified or  not  in  its conception, fails to produce the desired effect; Allied  unity is  strained ; payments by Germany on any adequate scale are not forthcoming.  Moreover, the steady deterioration- tion of German currency renders it impracticable for her to meet her liabilities under the Schedule of Payments  fixed  in May 1921.  It  may be that  German  policy has contributed largely to create this situation.  But it  is with  the  results, even more than with the  causes, that we are now concerned, and it is  to these that His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to direct the attention of their allies.  .   The view was put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government at  the  Paris  Conferencein January last, and is still  held  by them, that, in  order to obtain from Germany  the payments which the Allies are entitled to receive, German credit must be  re-established, German currency must be stabilised, the German budget must be balanced, and Germanproductivity  must  be encouraged.  As  long as  the most highly  developed area of German  industrial life remains under military rule,  and is  made  the scene  of politicalagitation, it is  difficult to see how the  economic problem  can  be solved.   It may bepossible to break Germany&apos;s  power of resistance by such means;  but it will be  at  theprice  of  that very recovery  upon  which  the  Allied  policy depends for its  ultimatesuccess.   If it be the case that the so-called passive  resistance of Germany is the main obstacle  that stands in the  way  of that consummation, and if its  abandonment will be the first step towards a positive  advance, His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite prepared to join  their allies  in pressing  such a  policy, as indeed  they  have already pressed it, upon the German Government, and in the proposed draft of a joint Allied reply to  the German note of the 7th June, which they have  the honour herewith to submit, the proposal  has been definitely  put forward.  But if this  plan is to be  pursued with realhope  of  success,  it  would  appear that  two other  conditions will require to  be[10363]Also to Italian, Belgian and Japanese Ambassadors.
simultaneously satisfied.   The first is that a  renewed  and serious attempt should K3made to deal with  the  question  of  reparations  by determining, not the liability ofGermany-for that has already been laid down- but ber capacity to pay.  The second is that proposals  should be made for the restoration  of the Ruhr to  that condition which will  enable  it to become an  area  of  fruitful production,  rather than one ofinternational strife.     As regards  the first of these steps, it will be  acknowledged that  the reparationfigure laid down in 1921 no longer  corresponds to the realities of the situation.calculations must sooner or later  be made.  It  is. in the best interest of the Alliesthat, . whatever  figure  be  finally  decided  upon  by them, it should  be accepted bythe  German Government as just  and realisable.  Furthermore, the  situation  is likelynot  to grow better, but  to  become worse; with delay.  A recurrence to procedure byultimatums may indeed produce tardy and reluctant capitulation ; but. little satisfactionwill  accrue if it fails to produce substantial deliveries either in  cash or in  kind.     The German Government have proposed in  their recent  note to allow Germanyscapacity to pay-, as well as the mode of payment, to be investigated  by an impartialbody.   Under article 234 of the Treaty  of Versailles, a reduction of the total amountdeclared by the Reparation Commission to be  payable by Germany can be  made, ifexplicitly  authorised by the  several Governments represented  on the  commission.There is  nothing to prevent those Governments, or the  Reparation  Commission&apos; onwhich they  are represented, from calling into council  such impartial and  expert  assist-ance as they may desire.   Fortified by such authority, the  Commission and the Govern.intents would be  in a strong  position to invite from the German Government, who underthe  terms  of the  treaty would  have a right,  to  be heard,  the  fulfilment of theundertaking contained in the German note.     As to  the  composition of  such an enquiry,  this  is  a matter  which  should bedetermined  by the Allied Governments  in consultation;   There should be no difficultyin agreeing  upon a selection of competent persons enjoying their  confidence as well asthat of the  public.  Further, the  advantage of American co-operation in this enquiry,whether in an official or in. an unofficial  capacity, scarcely requires emphasis,  and isconfidently  recommended by His Majesty&apos;s Government to their allies.   &apos; Should His Majesty&apos;s  Government be  so fortunate  as  to carry with them the assent of their allies thus  far, they will be  ready without delay to enter into a more detailed discussion of the precise  steps  to be successively taken in  order to carry out this  plan of action.  They  only shrink  from  submitting more definite proposals nowbecause experience  has shown that hard  and fast schemes are apt to impede rather than to promote  a general agreement.     There  remains  the  question,  should the  German  Government accept the  advicewith regard to cessation  from passive resistance, which it is proposed to tender to them,of the future position in  the Ruhr.   His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the Frenchand  Belgian Governments will be the first to aejree that the character of the occupationshould in those circumstances undergo a swift and material change;  that the  numbersof the military forces stationed in the Ruhr and at other places occupied  since  Januarylast  should  be reduced as rapidly  as  possible; and that assurances of ultimate and complete evacuation, when the guarantees have been put into effective operation,  shouldnot be withheld.   Simultaneously, the various measures  that  have  been promulgatedin the name of the Rhineland Commission for coercing the civil  population and impedingthe free movement  of persons and  goods would doubtless be either cancelled or  relaxed;as generous an amnesty as possible would be accorded ;  and the return  of the  expelledpopulation and functionaries would be facilitated under suitable guarantees.     It has not been thought either necessary  or desirable to include in the draft replyto the German Government the  more  precise indications  which are  contained in this despatch.   Attaching, as they do,  the highest importance to the maintenance of Alliedunity, and convinced that only by such unity will  an  early solution of the problem  befound, His Majesty&apos;s Government have drawn up the  draft reply in a spirit and in terms which they  trust may be acceptable to their allies.     They will, of course, be glad to  consider auy suggestions  or emendations which any  of the latter may think fit  to  propose consistently with the main lines  of policywhich it has been the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos; to  expound and to defend.     Should the note  meet with  general favour^ there would appear to be  manifestadvantages  in its early despatch,  and His Majesty&apos;s Government  express the earnesthops that there may be ho delay in arriving at a decision on the subject.     Tbe?.presBnt communication, addressed to the  Allies alone,  has been added in orderto acquaint them in greater detail with the  plans which  His Majesty&apos;s Government

V.                          phope to be permitted to pursue  in  conjunction  with  them, and which may be thusresumed:     1. The German  Government to  undertake to  abandon  the  policy  of  passive          resistance.    2. Steps to be taken upon the cessation of passive resistance for the resumption  of          the civil administration  of the  Ruhr, and  to  provide for the progressive          evacuation of those areas.    3. A  body of impartial experts to be set up, charged with the duty of advising the ;          Allied  Governments  and the&apos; Reparation  Commission respectively as  to          Gerraany&apos;s capacity to pay, and as  to the mode of payment to be prescribed.          The co-operation of an American expert to be sought, and arrangements  to          be mnde for German experts to be  consulted and heard.    4. The same body,  or  a  body  similarly  constituted, to be asked to  advise the          Reparation Commission as  to the  economic sureties and  guarantees to  be          pledged by Germany to the Allies.    5. Inter-Allied discussions to be opened  with as little delay as possible, whether by          conference or otherwise, for the purpose of elaborating a comprehensive plan          of a general and final  financial settlement.    6. So  soon as  the  economic sureties and guarantees which  Germany will have          pledged  to the Allies have been put into effective operation, the occupation          of  all German territory outside  the limits laid down in the Treaty  of          Versailles to come to an end.    His Majesty&apos;s Government  venture to submit the foregoing  proposals to  their allies with the conviction that  in  the common  interest positive action can no longersafely be delayed, and in the hope that they  may help to facilitate a definite advance.    His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  have  not  dealt in this note with the  question  of security, but they have  already  indicated their  readiness to enter  into sympathetic consideration of the  subject whenever it may be thought desirable.                                           I have, &amp;c.                                                 CURZON OF  KEDLESTON.                               Enclosure in No. 1.                  Draft Identic Reply to the German Government.    ON the  2nd May the  German Government  addressed an identic  note to  the,Governments of the United States of America,  Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy,and Japan, containing certain proposals for a settlement of the question of reparations.    To this note separate replies were returned by the French and Belgian Governments,acting  in  unison, and  by  the Italian, British and  Japanese  Governments  actingseparately.  These replies concurred, however, in regarding the German  proposals asmacceptable,  the main  criticism directed  against them being  that neither the totalamounts suggested as payable for  reparation, nor the mode  of  payment,  nor   the guarantees offered,  were at all adequate,  &quot;while settlement of any kind  was madecontingent on the evacuation of the  Ruhr, pending which passive  resistance by  theGermans was not to be renounced.    The unfavourable reception accorded to these proposals having led  the GermanGovernment to reconsider its attitude, that Government on the  7th June addressed asecond communication to the same Powers.    In this memorandum, the German Government, affirming once again its  deterrnina-    to discharge  its reparation debt, repeated a proposal which  it had before made, to efer to an impartial international tribunal  the  question both  of the amount and  the  etnods of payment, undertook to furnish such a body with all possible information   . assistance in conducting the investigation, and  promised to accept the  decision at  Inch it might arrive.  Further, the German Government  jn-oposed  certain  guarantees 1 Slu&apos;eties for the regular payment of the liabilities thus fixed,  involving,  however, the rant of a moratorium of four years from the  present date.    finally, the German  Government suggested a conference at which Germany might e assisted by oral discussion in arriving at  a solution of all these questions.    fhe German note did not,  on this  occasion, contain any reference to the subject of a.ssive resistance, not,  it is  presumed, from  any failure  to  appreciate its peculiar      [10363]                                 &apos;              &quot;             B  2
importance, but  because that topic  had not been mentioned in all of the replies of theAllied Governments to which the note was intended as an answer.     The  Allied  Governments, anxious  to terminate  the  phase  equally of  papetcontroversy and  of international complication, will .now give  their views upon each ofthese matters.     In  the  Treaty of Versailles  it  was recognised by the Allied and associated governments that, while  affirming the fuli  responsibility of  Germany for all  the loss and damage which they had suffered  at  her hands during the war, they could not, inview of her diminished resources, expect to receive from  her complete reparation for all such loss and damage.  In other words, the necessity was admitted, even at that dateof adjusting the liability of Germany to her capacity  to pay.     In  May 1921 the  amount  of reparation was fixed by the Reparation commission at 132 milliards  of gold marks.  No power was given  by the  treaty to cancel any partof that  obligation, except with the specific authority  of the  several governments represented on the commission.  If, therefore, the contention  is now put forward that,owing to the altered circumstances of to-day, the figure of 1921 is too high and calls for reduction, it  can only be by action within the framework of the treaty that  such reduction can properly be made ; and it is only from  this point of view that  the AlliedPowers  are free  to consider the first  request of the German Government in the notenow under reply, namely, the request  for an examination by an impartial international tribunal of Germany&apos;s  present capacity for payment.     The  Allied  Governments, while  unable to accede to  this request in  the  form inwhich it was proposed, are far  from thinking that they might not  be assisted in tintask devolved upon them by the  treaty  by the  labours  of  competent  and imparts!experts ;  and provided that nothing is done in this respect that is inconsistent with thetreaty stipulations, they  are disposed  to  think  that positive advantage might  result from such  an examination.  It  would bring the allegations of diminished capacity tothe test  of fact; it would reveal the actual position at  the  present  moment; and itwould remove all excuse for evasion.     The Allied Governments take  note of the  statement by the German Governmentthat it would welcome such an enquiry, and of its  pledge to abide by the result.     If  a binding arrangement  were entered into, concerning the discharge of the entireliability, as thus determined; and as  to the guarantees or sureties to be taken for theregular  and complete pay ment of the total debt, the  whole problem  would assumesdifferent aspect.     As  to the  guarantees  or sureties  themselves,   the  Allied  Governments,  whileappreciating  the effort of the German  Government to  advance  beyond the vagueindications of the earlier note of the 2nd  May, must  guard themselves from accept^these new proposals as  adequately,  or in  the  best possible  way, meeting the actin!requirements of the situation.   Their  economic value  must largely depend  upon iactwof which no mention is made in the German  note,  such as the stabilisation  of the mailand  the  balancing of the German budget.  A  careful examination of these, or other,supplementary guarantees will be  an inseparable feature of the euquiry which ifeAllied Governments are.prepared within the limits of the treaty to initiate.     It  must  be clear,  however,  that  no guarantees for the punctual  discharge Iaccepted liabilities will suffice, unless provision is at the same time made  for some fortof international control of German financial administration.  This is one  of the subjectto which it will be necessary to invite the serious attention of  the German Governmeitiand without a settlement  of which no final solution can be obtained.     When the German Government asks for oral discussion of all these matters, it i*ibe remembered  that, under the treaty, the  rieparation  Commission, while authorisefrom time to time to consider the resources and  capacity of Germany, is also under sobligation &quot;to give to the German  Government an  opportunity to be  heard.&quot;   11*will  allow for free consultation with the  latter, and will enable  it to  make a 1&quot;&apos;presentation of the German case.     Such  is  the reply of the Allied Governments  to  the main propositions of 9German note.   There  remains, however,  one  important  consideration  which is wantecedent condition to a willingness on the part of the Allies to reopen the question to which reference has been made.  The  occupation of the  Ruhr valley  by the anr*forces of  certain of the Allies has been followed by measures  deliberately taken by wGerman Government to  impede this  policy and to  delay the payment  of reparationsThese measures may be summed up in the familiar phrase &quot; passive resistance.&quot;  If ^,German Government now desires  a  resumption of enquiry, it will, in  the opinion *&apos;the  Allied Governments, be  well advised  to  withdraw without  further  delay
 ordinances and decrees  which have organised and fomented this form of resistance, and openly and unequivocally to  disavow the acts of violence and sabotage which have in some cases accompanied it.    Were this action to be  taken without delay,  not only would it be regarded as an evidence of that good faith which the German Government has once again avowed, but it would involve a reconsideration by the occupying  Powers of the conditions of their occupation and a gradual  return  to  the normal  features of industrial life in the ruhr. Such a reversion would possess the additional advantage that, by re-establishing the productive activity  of that region,  it  would enable  the German Government more speedily and more effectively to discharge its reparation debt.    In making this reply to the German note, the Allied Governments have  clearly demonstrated  their earnest desire for the cessation of conflict and the  pacification ofEurope.  In return they feel that they have the right to invite the co-operation of theGerman Government in the  execution of this  policy;  and  they have indicated  withas much precision as is possible at  the present stage the reciprocal steps by which  each party can effectively contribute to the desired result.o
