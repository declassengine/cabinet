(This document is the property of His Britanhio Majesty&apos;s Government.                         C A B I H E T.                    HOMS  , AFFAIRS  COMMITTEE.                   CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL,                Memorandum by the Home Secretary.      Major Paget has introduced a Bill to enable a Court toimpose a penalty of whipping on persona found guilty of sexualoffences against girls under 13 and against imbecile women orgirls.  It is understood that the Bill is widely supported in all quarters of the House, and Major Paget believes tba&apos;, &apos;he would havea chance of getting the Second Reading unopposed at 11 o&apos;clocksome night if tho Government would not object.  At present theBill is: being blocked by tho Whips at my request but the PrimeMinister has asked me to have the Bill considered by tho HomeAffairs Committee,      In introducing the Bill Major Paget stated as a result ofhis own experience as a Magistrate that this offence is on theincrease, but this contention is not borne.out by the statistics -see table attached - and the Home Office has no evidence to showthat a strengthening of the penalties is required.      The imposition of whipping is a policy which always arousesa oonsidorable controversy., and it may be argued that theextension proposed in the Bill is unlikely to havo any greatdeterrent effect.  Section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,1885, already provide a for tho whipping of offenders under 16,and adults who are guilty of violent attacks for the purpose, ofrape can be flogged under the Garottars Act, 1863 (.26 &amp; 27 Viet.,c.44).      The Dill as drawn is limited to (a) offences against girlsR E T.307(23).
under 15, and (b) offences against &quot;any female idiot orimbecile woman or girl&quot;.  Apparently the promoters do not intend to apply it to offe:vieyB against girls between the ages of 13 and 16, but probably some motion would be made in committee to extend it to these cases, and if so? thocontroversy which took up so.much time last Session wouldbo revived.      It should be notod that the title of the Bill, which relates only to &quot;the better protection of young children&quot;,is inconsistent with tho provision rendering persons guilty of an offence under Section 5 (8) of the Criminal law amendment Act, 18857 liable to whipping.  Section 5  (2)relates to assaults on female idiots or imbeciles of any age.      To enable the Bill to be properly understood I appendcopies of the material portions of Sections 4 and 5  of the criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885.                                 wi; c. 3.3rd July, 1983.
