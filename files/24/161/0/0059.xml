[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]-.----                                        .ge8                  Printed for the  Cabinet.   July 1923.SECRET.1 6CP. 359 (23).                                  CABINET.THE  RELATIONS OF THE  NAVY AND  AIR FORCE. NOTE BY THE FIRST  LORD.  QJ? THE ADMIRALTY ON  THE SUB-COMMITTEE&apos;.? REPORT.    IT is essential that the Cabinet should realise  clearly the precise contention putforward by the Admiralty.  The Admiralty do not claim to limit in any respect, overland or over sea, the sphere of the Air Force as an  independent  and equal combatantService.  Nor do they everi^ claim the right to  create  a separate  Naval Air Force, assuch, on however small a scale.   All they claim is that the work of flying and attendingto the aeroplanes on the ships of the Navy, work as  essentially and intimately a part ofthe future fighting  work of the  Navy as gunnery or torpedo work, should  be done bythe Navy itself.   They claim that if this work is done  by the Navy it can be done moreefficiently and far more economically, but more  important still that the full effective co-ordination, in action, of the Fleet ah work with the rest of the  fighting work, canonly  be secured  if the  flying work is absolutely dovetailed in with the rest of the work,and if the whole personnel of  the Navy  is permeated  by  the knowledge of what the .flying arm can,,or cannot, do.    The Admiralty are convinced  that  they cannot answer  for the efficiency of theFleet, or for the security of the Empire,  if they are denied responsibility for the adminis-tration and development of what is an integral and increasingly important  part of thefighting work of the. Fleet, work upon  whose success  or failure, both in the hands ofthose who actually fly off the ships, and even more in the hands of the Commander whohas to decide when to launch  them, everything may depend.    But the case is not  based on mere theoretical  principle.   The Admiralty  were originally, prepared  to try  the experiment  of divided  control,  and it  is only inconsequence of the serious and continued representations of all the Senior commanding officers  that  the system  did not work  efficiently, and of  their  own difficulties in securing the progress  they desire  to achieve, that  they were compelled to reopen thequestion.    The  only conceivable  justification  for divided control  is  divided user.   It theFleet Air Arm could be regarded  as a section of the Air Force co-operating with theNavy, but detachable from it and available for use  with the main Air Force elsewhere,there might be a case for its administration and control by what would then in realitybe  its parent  service.   But there is no question of such divided or joint user.   TheFleet Air Arm can no more  be regarded as  detachable than any other  part of theNavy,  ft must go where the Battle Fleet goes, and in no  serious war  that  can beimagined-except the  one case of  war with Germany will the main Battle Fleet everbe anywhere  near the main Air  Force.   This  is  admitted  in  the. Sub-Committee&apos;sReport (Paper No. N.D. (6,0).),* which in paragraph 3b definitely lays it down that theFleet Air Arm cannot be touched in war or emergency by the Air Ministry except withAdmiralty consent  or by an express Cabinet decision; in other words, that it is,  whenit comes to business, a  part of the Navy  and not of the Air Force.     In view of this I am bound to put two questions :      1. Of what  conceivable  advantage is it to the Air Ministry to interfere  in peace           time in the administration of a part of the work of  the Navy, which they           will never control  in time of war,  and with which their own Air Force will           rarely, if ever, come in contact in the course of operations 1                      * Circulated to the Cabinet with CP. 349 (23).

     2.  Of what conceivable disadvantage is it to the Air Ministry, which  has already            greater  difficulties in the  way of the  recruitment and. organisation of a            vastly expanded Air  Force  than it can well cope with, to be free of a small            but highly specialised piece of work which it has to endeavour to organise            inside on other Service to meet the wishes of that Service ?     No answer is given  to  either of these  questions  in  the  Report, unless it be the reference iu paragraph 3 to the view of the Air Ministry that &quot; dismemberment&quot; would be the same  in principle, however much &quot; relatively  diminished.&quot;  The  Fleet Air personnel  is about  5 per cent,  of  the present  Air  Force,  and its growth  is pretty definitely circumscribed by the  provisions of the Washington Treaty with  regard to aircraft carriers, while the Air Force is to  be increased at least  threefold.  And what is meant by &quot; dismemberment&quot; 1  No  one suggests that the existence of the Marines con. stitutes a &quot; dismemberment &quot;  of the Army.     It is worth noting, however, that this &quot; dismemberment&quot; was  not  regarded as a serious objection by the Chief of the Air Staff in his memorandum of the 25th November, 1919 (see Command Paper 467),  in  which he spoke of &quot;a small part of the  Air  Force. &quot; specially trained for work with the Navy, and a small part specially trained for work &quot; with the Army, these two small portions probably becoming  in the future an arm of &quot; the older Services.&quot;     Under the  system recommended in the  Eeport,  as amplified in the covering&quot;memorandum by the main Committee, the Fleet Air Arm will be organised as follows, The personnel which flies and attends to the  aeroplanes is, when afloat and it is only when afloat that it is used in  action-to be as completely under the executive authority of the naval captain of the  ship in which and from which it  works and fights, as the Marines.    It remains,  however,  for purposes of administration,  pay and promotion, under the Air Ministry, and when ashore  comes  entirely under Air  Ministry authority and Air Force  discipline.   To  secure closer touch and in order  to permeate the higher ranks of the Navy with officers  of  flying  experience, it is  proposed  that this personnel should  be composed, up to a  maximum of 70  per  cent, in the case of officers and an unspecified proportion in  the case  of  other ranks, of naval officers and men who will be temporarily detached  from their own Service  in  respect  of  administration, pay, appointment and promotion,  and  &quot;attached&quot;  to  another Service  in order to serve exclusively with their own Service.  It is impossible to believe that  such an  in and out arrangement can  really work smoothly or efficiently,  or  attract  the best  men, even with the concession  that  these  naval  officers serving  under the  Air Ministry in the Navy should  be  allowed to retain  their naval uniform.;   The  cost  of the whole organisation is to be borne on Navy Votes.     The  questions that inevitably  occur  are &quot;who is responsible for  the  efficiency of &quot;  the work that is done by this personnel ? &quot; and &quot; to what master  do any of  them look &quot;  for reward in their career&apos;? &quot;  To  neither of these questions is it possible to give any kind of an answer, either  now or after failure in the test of war.     I would urge  most seriously that if responsibility is to be divided, it should at least not be inextricably muddled up.  If  the Cabinet should  decide that  it is in the public interest that the Air Ministry should supply the  material and the shore training of the  Fleet Air Arm, let the personnel itself at any  rate look to one  master only, the  Service in which it  serves in peace and  which depends upon it for its  success in war.  If it is  further thought desirable, as the  Report suggests, that a proportion of Air  Force personnel should serve with the Navy, in  order to  keep  the naval air wort in touch with the work  done in  the Air Force and  reciprocally to  profit  by naval experience, the Admiralty would welcome  such a suggestion, and these officers or men could be attached in the ordinary way.  This would be a compromise falling very mm short of what the Admiralty believe to be the most  efficient solution, but it would at any rate afford some sort of demarcation of responsibility.                                                        (Initialled)      L. S. A     Admiralty, 28th July, 1923.
