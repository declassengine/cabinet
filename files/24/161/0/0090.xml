              CIRCULATED  TO  THE  CABINET.    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Goveniment]-              ^^Si^^v                                       6 8GERMANY.          ----^l^V                    [August 11.]SECTION 1,The Marquess Gurzon of Kedleston to Count de Saint-Aulaire. Your Excellency,                              Foreign Office, August 11, 1923.  1. THE most sincere disappointment has been caused to His Majesty&apos;s government by the replies which they have received under date of the 30th July from the Frenchand Belgian Governments to their identic notes of the 20th ultimo.  With those noteswas submitted the draft of a joint Allied answer which His Majesty&apos;s government proposed should be sent to the German memorandum of the 7th June.  The proposalrepresented an earnest effort on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, whilst showingthe utmost  regard for the known views of the French and Belgian Governments,to indicate a practical way of arriving as promptly as possible at a final settlementof the question of German reparations.  2. His Majesty&apos;s Government had understood that there  were in  the opinion ofthe French  and Belgian Governments  two main obstacles standing  in the way ofany  fresh move in  seeking such settlement:  (1)  the  necessity of scrupulouslyrespecting the rights of the Reparation Commission under the Treaty of Versaillesas regards the fixing of the German debt and determining  the modes of  payment;and. (2)  the attitude of the  German  Government in encouraging passive resistance to the Franco-Belgian occupation and exploitation of the Ruhr.  3.  With both these questions, accordingly, His Majesty&apos;s Government  proposed,in their suggested reply to  the German memorandum, to deal  in a  manner whichthey confidently expected would commend  itself to their Allies.   How completelythey have been disappointed in this expectation is made manifest by the contents of the notes in which, the French and Belgian Governments have replied to their proposals.  i.  His Majesty&apos;s Government acknowledge with  much appreciation the  courteoustone of those notes.  If they now proceed to comment  upon them,  they trust that their remarks will be received in the friendly spirit in which they are offered.  5.  A .reply seems to be all the  more necessary, since,  in the desire  to  avoidcontroversy  at a critical phase, His Majesty&apos;s Government refrained from sendingany  rejoinder to  the observations which  the French  and Belgian Governmentscommunicated to them over a month ago in reply to  the so-called questionnaire whichI had addressed to the two Governments.  Sooner than embark upon any controversywith their Allies, His Majesty&apos;s Government preferred at  that time to  submit adefinite  plan of action, under which  they proposed  that the  suggested enquiry into germany&apos;s capacity to pay should be conducted within the framework of the Treatyof Versailles,  and that the German Government should be called upon to withdraw the  orders  and measures   by which they  have enjoined  passive  resistance.Furthermore,  in order to  comply with the declared objection of their French andBelg ian Allies to any specific bargain  being made on this point with the GermanGovernment, the British  proposals were  restricted  to  an  intimation  that  if  theGerman Government were to abandon passive resistance without delay,  not only would this  be regarded as an evidence  of good  faith,  but it would  involve areconsideration by the occupying Powers of the conditions of their occupation anda gradual return to the normal features of industrial life in  tne Ruhr.  6.  It is difficult to think in what way greater consideration could have been shown to the Franco-Belgian point of view.  7.  The reception, however, that has been accorded to these proposals by the Frenchand Belgian Governments in  their respective notes of  the  30th July,  leaves HisMajesty&apos;s Government, notwithstanding the terms  of courtesy employed, under thepainful impression that neither are their suggestions welcomed by their Allies, nor is their offered co-operation  held to merit consideration except on condition that nodeparture be made in any one particular from whatever France and Belgium declareto be their overriding views and decisions.  8. It is true that the Belgian reply appears at first sight to be less uncompromisingthan the French note.  But on closer examination it is seen that  the attitude of thetwo Governments is for all practical purposes identical, and that, though the BelgianGovernment appear to be especially anxious for the continuance of friendly conversa-tions, it is only upon condition that the substance of the Belgian claims is  conceded                            * A Iso to Baron. Moncheur.      [10461]                                                        B
in advance.  Accordingly, His Majesty&apos;s Government ask leave to deal with, the tworeplies in a single answer.  9. The first point that has struck His Majesty&apos;s Government is that in neither is there any allusion whatsoever to the terms of the draft reply to the German memo-randum which His Majesty&apos;s Government had proposed.  The Belgian Governmentindeed,  still  remain  in   favour  of  the  principle  of  a  joint  reply,  butthe  French  Government  pass  the  proposal  over  in  complete silence. &apos; and yet  this  was  the main  object  to  which,  in  their  desire  for the  continuedmaintenance of Allied unity, His Majesty&apos;s Government had devoted their efforts.The omission is hardly compensated by a series of argumentative passages, enquiries on points of detail, and offers of further discussions and conversations, holding out a prospect of an indefinitely spun-out controversy, whilst  fundamental principles  areonly mentioned in order to declare that they do not admit of discussion.  10. It may perhaps be said  that the Belgian reply does not reject, as categorically asdoes the French, the proposal for a fresh investigation of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay,But the consent of the Belgian Government to such an enquiry is made conditional upon obtaining for Belgium  and for France pecuniary advantages of a far-reachingkind, at the expense of their Allies, and notably of Great Britain.   Such a suggestionappears to His Majesty&apos;s Government to reveal  a palpable misconception of  thesituation.  11. It will not be contested that there can be no use  in demanding from Germanymore than she is capable of paying.  What is the maximum she can pay, is a questionof supreme importance to all her creditors.  It is a question of establishing a fact, onthe ascertainment of which any practical arrangements or combinations for obtainingpayment to the fullest extent possible must be based.   The British government accordinly proposed to take steps to ascertain this important fact.  Belgium repliesthat she will not consent unless a corresponding advantage is obtained by herself andby  France.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government could  not willingly enter into any suchtransaction.  12. While  the Belgian note does not indicate any precise claim, official  and semi-official pronouncements by and on behalf of French and Belgian Ministers have made it clear that  the French Government wish to insist on a minimum payment to them of 26 milliard gold marks over and above the amount required to meet their debtsowing to this country  and to the United States, and the Belgian Government on aminimum payment of 5 milliard gold marks, for which, or for part of which, they nowask for further priority.  13. If the estimate-made on a 5 per cent, basis by M. Bokanowski, the Rapporteurof the French Budget,  which  put the  present value of the annuities under  theSchedule  of  Payments  at  65 milliard gold  marks,   may be  accepted  as  anapproximately correct basis of calculation, the share of France and Belgium as fixed by  the  percentages  established under the  Spa Agreement (52  and 8  per cent.respectively) would not exceed 34 milliards for France and 5-2 milliards for Belgium,even if Germany were in  a position to pay  the total figures of the Schedule.   ButBelgium has already, under  the agreement  which entitles her to priority payments of 2\ milliard gold francs ( 100 million),  received  approximately \\ milliard goldmarks ( 73 million sterling), a sum far exceeding the receipts of any other Power.Though this priority was given when the total  sums expected from Germany wereimmensely larger than  anything  that  is now likely to be received, it  has  notbeen  reduced proportionately, and it has therefore operated to give Belgium an increasingly  disproportionate share of actual receipts up to date.   In addition,  she has been entirely relieved of her war debts to the  Allies, amounting to nearly  300million sterling.  14. France, on the other hand, when counting on receiving 34 milliard gold marksfrom Germany,  would have to balance this amount against  her debt to this country,representing about 12  milliard gold  marks, and  her debt to  the United  States,amounting  at least to the  equivalent  of  15 milliard  gold marks,  or,  together,27  milliards, which, being  set off against the 34  milliards to be obtained fromGermany, would leave France with a balance  of 7 milliards.  When, therefore it isnow suggested that she ought to receive 26 milliards  net, her total debts to GreatBritain and the United  States being cancelled,  it will be seen  that the  demand is for an  amount between three and four times  larger than would, on balance, tallto her share under the existing agreements.   It is difficult to see on what  grounds a failure of Germany to meet her obligations, by which Great Britain is proportionatelydamnified equally with her  Allies, can be  held  to justify a claim by France to beplaced, at the expense of her  Allies, in a far more favourable position than she wouldhave occupied under the Schedule of Payments itself.
    15. The Belgian proposal to grant a special priority for the restoration of devastated  areas seems to rest on a somewhat artificial distinction as regards damages inflicted  by the enemy in the late war.  It is a suggestion not merely that priority should be  conceded to material damages over the cost of war pensions, but that one particular  type of material damage, namely, damage by land,  should be selected for priority, to  the exclusion of other forms of material damage. No justification for such a proposal  can be found in the armistice terms or in the Peace Treaty;  nor is it easy to conceive  what argument can be adduced to support it.  Sunk ships and cargoes rotting at the  bottom of the sea  may  not  shock the eye  like the ruined villages of France and  Belgium.  But they are equally material damage caused by  German aggression, and  represent equally heavy losses of national  wealth.  Great  Britain&apos;s  proportion of  reparations would not in fact be  seriously altered as a result of priority conceded to  material damages.  Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be in favour  of priority even on that basis, if  only for the reason that  certain other Allies would  be gravely and adversely affected.   16. In practice the suggested priority would be equivalent to an alteration in favour  of France and Belgium of the percentages of division fixed by the  Spa     agreement.  For it is clear that if Belgian and  French claims in respect of their devastated  regions are to be met in full before the claims of the other Allies are considered, and if, at the same time, the total sums recoverable from Germany are diminished, the loss  represented by such  diminution must inevitably  fall on  those not  enjoying  the privilege of priority.   17. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot admit that there is any ground whatever for revising the Spa percentages.  The principle of a percentage division is not affected by a change in the total to which  the percentages apply.  His Majesty&apos;s Government, cannot leave out of account the position of their own country. Apart from the heavy material damages suffered by Great  Britain, His  Majesty&apos;s Government are now involved in heavy payments to meet unemployment, in respect of which they have been compelled to spend  over 400,000,000/.  since the armistice.  They  alone, among the Allies are paying interest on debts incurred abroad during the war, representing a  capital  sum due  to  the  United States  Government  of  1,000,000,0002.  at the present rate  of exchange.   They alone  have been deprived, in the Allied interest,  of foreign securities estimated at from  700,000,0002. to  800,000,000/., which would  otherwise  substantially  assist  in  the  payment of  the  British debt  in  America.    Notwithstanding  these  gigantic   burdens,  Great   Britain made an  offer  at the  Paris  Conference of  January  last to forego  her rights to reimbursement of her damages, and expressed her readiness, by reducing the debts of the Allies, to treat her share of German reparations as  if it were a repayment by her Allies of their debts due to her.  It would be inequitable, and it is impossible, to ask the British taxpayer, already much more heavily burdened than his French and Belgian allies, to make further sacrifices by modifying the Spa percentages for the benefit of France and Belgium.   18. Whilst the Belgian Government  attach to their consent to an investigation by impartial experts of Germany&apos;s  capacity to pay,  a condition  which  renders such consent of little value, the French  Government reject the plan altogether, and appear to justify their refusal by putting  a series of questions  which  might lead to  au indefinitely protracted discussion at a time when  prompt decision is of essential importance.  As, however, M. Poincare has asked for answers on the several points which he has raised, they may be  briefly given.  19.  Astonishment is expressed that anyone should  question the justice of the Reparation Commission^ decision in  fixing the total amount payable  by Germany at 132 milliards of  gold  marks ( 6,600,00t),000), and  M. Poincare sees no reason why &quot; an estimate made  to-day by experts,  whoever they may be, should be more &quot;exact  than  that  made  in  1921.&quot;    It  is  not  clear  to what  estimate made  in  1921 reference is  made.    The   Reparation  Commission^  finding  of 132 milliards  of gold marks was  a simple  estimate  of the amount   of  the damages, for  which  compensation  was claimable  under  the treaty,   without any  regard  to  the  question  of  Germany&apos;? &apos; capacity  to  pay  them.    It  is true that  the  Schedule of Payments  subsequently adopted, while purporting  to provide  for the payment of  the  full  amount of  the  damages,  in  fact, granted substantial concessions by extending the period  of  payment beyond that laid down in the treaty, and, by waiving the payment of interest for a long period in respect of a large part of the.debt..  These concessions represented, even in the opinion of the Rapporteur of the French budget, a virtual reduction by approximately one-half of the sum of 132 milliards, and the fact that  they were approved by  the Allied PrimeMinisters in drafting the Schedule of Payments (subsequently accepted by theEepara-
 tion Commission) effectively answers the contention that the sum, as originally fixed was not considered too high by anybody.  At the same time, it cannot be said that the concessions were the outcome  of  anything that  could be described as an  expert enquiry into Germany&apos;s capacity to pay.   20. The Trench  Government  are&apos; quite right in  declaring  that  the  duty of adjusting the Schedule, of Payments to that capacity in accordance with article 234 of the treaty is one which still remains to be discharged.   21. They say that during  the Peace Conference the American expert estimated Germany&apos;s capacity to pay at 120 milliard gold marks.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have not been able  to trace in  their records any American expert estimate  of 120 milliards,  though they have found one of 60 milliards  and another of 240 milliards. There was also a French estimate of 800 milliards, and  a British estimate  of 480 milliards.    The truth,  of course, is that at that time there was no experience of attempts to establish and enforce inter-State obligations of such magnitude,  to which experts could look for guidance.   It is precisely because such experience has become available during the last five years that a fresh enquiry is urgently called for.   22.  The duty of  making the ultimate decision rests in part on the Reparation Commission, and in part on the Allied Governments,  seeing that, if circumstances necessitate a cancellation of any part of the capital debt, the specific authority of the several Government represented on the Commission is required.   It is a duty which must, in terms) of the treaty, be performed with sole reference to the resources and capacity of Germany.  The  Governments represented on the  Commission, in deciding whether or not to authorise the cancellation of a part of the German debt, are in the  position of trustees, since the interests affected are not only their own, but also those  of the Governments not represented on the  Commission a consideration which His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to think the French  Government must have overlooked when stating that  &quot; France will never consent to such cancellation  except &quot; in the proportion  in which  her own war debts may be  cancelled.&quot;   23.  An  enquiry,  therefore, by impartial experts into  German capacity, held to assist the  preparation Commission, and (should a cancellation of a part of  the debt be regarded as necessary)  the Allied Governments, to  carry out their duties  under that article, clearly  cannot be held to violate any principle expressed or implied in the treaty.   24.  Both the French and the Belgian notes dwell on the special qualifications of the Reparation Commission to carry out itself any necessary enquiries.  This is a claim which cannot be sustained without  serious qualification.    In: the absence  of an American  representative (as originally contemplated), France and Belgium  are in a position, with  the aid of the  casting vote of the French Chairman, to carry  any resolution  over the heads of the British and Italian representatives, and it is notorious that in these circumstances the Commission has become in  practice an instrument of Franco-Belgian policy alone.   25.  The French  Government ask how it  is proposed that  the impartial expert commission should be constituted.  His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the more comprehensive its constitution, the greater will be the value  of its  findings.  They would willingly see  upon it nominees, not only  of the Powers  entitled to reparation, but of the  United States of America, of Powers which  took no part in the late war, and, it would seem desirable, of Germany herself.  If,  however, the French  Govern- ment would prefer any other form of constitution, His Majesty&apos;s Government  would be happy to consider it.   26. As regards its relation to the Reparation  Commission and to the Allied  Govern- ments: while for their own part His Majesty&apos;s Government would be entirely willing to enter into an agreement by which the&apos; several Governments  would bind themselves in advance to recommend to the Reparation Commission the acceptance of the  findings of the body of experts, they would, if the French  and Belgian Governments are  not prepared to go so far, be content that the functions of the experts should  be advisory only.                                                                    ,  . .   27. Both the French and Belgian notes challenge the British  contention that it is m the best interest of the Allies  that whatever figure be finally decided upon as repre- senting Germany&apos;s total liabilities, it should be accepted by the German Government as just and reasonable.   They point to the, fact that the German Government  have, in the past, repeatedly failed  to act up to their undertakings.  28. His  Majesty&apos;s Government remain of opinion  that an undertaking freelyentered into, because acknowledged  to be just  and reasonable,  stands,  in practice,on a different footing, and offers better  prospects of  faithful execution, than  an engagement subscribed under the  compulsion of an ultimatum,  and protested
against at the very moment of signature as beyond the signatory&apos;s capacity to make good.  The Reparation Commission itself, as well as the principal Allied Govern-ments, has had, on occasion, to recognise that the German Government was not in aposition to carry out particular obligations which it had been compelled to undertake.  29.  It will be remembered that the suggestion of an enquiry by experts, of whichfirst idea originated with the American Secretary of State, included a voluntaryengagement  by  the German Government to accept  and give effect to  whateverconclusions the experts  might arrive  at.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  are  not convinced that such an engagement deserves to be treated as of no value.   30.  The subject of the occupation of the Ruhr gives rise to a number of propositions in the French note to which it is necessary to reply.  Whilst His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment have indicated their readiness to join in advising the  German Government to withdraw without  delay  the ordinances and  decrees  which have organised and promoted passive resistance,  they cannot subscribe to the  thesis  that passive resistance must cease unconditionally because it is contrary  to  the Treaty  of Versailles.   31.  France and Belgium hold that the occupation has been effected in virtue of the authority conferred by paragraph 18 of annex II to Part VIII of the Treaty.  The German Government have consistently contended that such an operation does not, on a  proper interpretation of that paragraph, fall within the category of &quot;economic &quot;and financial prohibitions and reprisals and in general such other measures as the &quot;respective Governments may determine to be necessary in the circumstances.&quot;   32.  The highest legal  authorities in Great Britain have advised His Majesty&apos;s Government that the contention of the German Government is well founded, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have  never  concealed their view  that the Franco-Belgian action in occupying the  Ruhr, quite apart from  the question of expediency, was not a sanction authorised by the Treaty itself.  But they would be quite willing that this or any other difference respecting the legal interpretation of vital provisions of the Treaty in so far  as they cannot be resolved by unanimous decision of the Reparation Commission under paragraph 12 of annex II whether arising  between the Allied Governments and  the German Government, or between different Allied Governments, should automatically be referred to the International Court of Justice at The Hague or other suitable arbitration.   33. The French Government have endeavoured to convict His Majesty&apos;s Government of inconsistency in now refusing to acknowledge the legality of the occupation of the Ruhr under paragraph 18 of  annex  II, when on two former occasions they joined in the presentation of  ultimata threatening such occupation,  and when in&apos; 1920  they actually participated in the occupation of dusseldorf, Duisburg and Ruhrort.  There is  no  inconsistency.   The action then taken or  threatened was never claimed to be in pursuance of the Reparation Clauses of the Treaty.  The Allies jointly decided to threaten Germany with the occupation of further territory  just as they might have threatened her with a renewal of war, for her failure to perform her Treaty obliga- tions. some of which had no connection whatever with Reparations.   34. In the  view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it cannot legitimately be claimed that the measures which the Allies are, under paragraph 18 of annex It, authorised to  take in certain  emergencies, include the  military occupation of territory.  Such occupation forms the subject  of the special provisions of Part XIV of  the Treaty, dealing with Guarantees.   It is the right to occupy the left bank of the Rhine  and the bridge-heads,  which has  been  given  to the Allies  &quot;as a guarantee  for  the  execution of the Treaty.&quot;  Moreover, article  430 particularly stipulates that if the Reparation  commission finds that Germany refuses to observe the whole or partof  her obligations  under the Treaty with regard to reparations,  the whole or  partof  the occupied territories, which  may  already have  been evacuated, &quot;will be  immediately reoccupied.&quot;   It would have been idle to stipulate expressly for such inoccupation in case of default on reparations, if the Allies had already an unlimitedright to occupy any German territory under another clause of the  Treaty.  35.  If His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto abstained from formally contesting the legality of the Franco-Belgian occupation as an act authorised by the Treaty, they have done so  solely in  conformity with  the spirit of the declaration, made bv Mr. Bonar  Law at  the Paris  Conference  in January last,  that His  Majesty&apos;s government desired  to avoid  causing any needless embarrassment to their Allies. tins should not be made a reproach to them.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would  not do^ I:CV  taVe taken UP thiS  ^uestion of leSality&apos; na(i tneJ not been challenged to      .&apos; 10461                                               ,il
G  36. The French  and Belgian Governments argue that if only Great  britain had  joined in the occupation there would have been no  passive resistance and anabundant flow of reparation payments would have been assured.  Holding the views which they did, both as to the legality  and the practical value of  the operation, itwas  not possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take part in it.   But even if theyhad  done so, and even if passive resistance had never been started or were now coming to an end, it is not clear now this would bring the problem  of reparations appreciablynearer to  a solution.  37. The French  Government have now declared that  the object  with whichthey entered the Ruhr was not the prompt or complete  payment of reparations, butthe breaking of Germany&apos;s resistance and the creation of the will on her part to pay.But  the will to pay is useless without the power, and Germany&apos;s power to pay is, in theopinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  likely to  be rapidly diminished, and in  theend extinguished altogether, by a continuation of the occupation with its strangleholdon the  most important centre  of the  most productive  and  the  most highly  anddelicately organised of German industries.  38. The parallel  which the French  Government seek to &quot;draw with German actionin 1871 can hardly be sustained.  It is true that Germany refused to quit the Frenchdepartments which she occupied with her forces  until the indemnity of 5 milliardshad  been paid.  But this occupation was expressly provided for by the Preliminariesof Peace of 1871.  No similar authority can be cited in the case of the Ruhr, and thereal  analogy in the present case is the occupation of the  left  bank of the Rhine, as provided for by the treaty, and from this no one has proposed to depart.  39. Further, it may be pointed out that the  recovery after the short campaign of1870-71 of  an indemnity equivalent to 4 milliards of gold marks (a considerablepercentage of  which could be immediately covered in gold, and against which, creditwas   given  for  the value of  property  in  ceded territories,  involving no actual expenditure by France beyond internal payments in  compensation for the interestsof French nationals dispossessed) is not really comparable to the enforcement  of athirty-three fold claim against a country  financially exhausted  by four  years ofstrenuous   warfare  and  blockade.    The   ease   with  which   the  indemnityimposed  in 1871  was   paid  was   largely  the result  of  the  credit  facilities which  France   was  able  to  obtain.    Germany  has,   on  the  other hand,suffered  from  a  complete  inability   to  obtain . foreign   loans, arising to  alarge extent from  the long period which elapsed before her reparation liabilitieswere defined,  and the world-wide uncertainty as to her  ability to discharge them.Yet, in spite  of  this,  it  is fair  to  state,  though His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentare  by no means satisfied with the performance,  that Germany has in fact paid inrespect of reparations and the cost of the armies  of occupation, more than twice theamount exacted  from France in 1871,  as well as considerable sums in connectionwith the clearing offices and miscellaneous treaty obligations.  40. The  French  Government are  in error  in  attributing  to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the suggestion that simultaneously with the advice  to be  given toGermany to- abandon passive resistance, the Ruhr must be made to  return to normalconditions of production.  The suggestion made in the British note of the 20th Julywas  that  proposals should be made for the restoration of  the Ruhr  to that condition which will enable it  to become an area of  fruitful production, rather than one ofinternational  strife.  His Majesty&apos;s Government confess  to a sense of surprise anddisappointment  at  the  difficulties  apparently  felt  - by  the  French  and  belgian governments in agreeing to so reasonable and so advantageous a proceeding.  41. Although, in  words  of  some  vagueness, it  is intimated  that Franceand  Belgium may, when  satisfied that passive resistance has ceased, consult  together as to how far they may  find it possible to lighten the burden which the  military occupation  of  the  Ruhr  lays on the region, nothing tangible is  suggested whichwould hold out any hope  of the occupation  being  brought to an end, even when theavowed object of breaking Germany&apos;s will to resist has been attained.  42. His Majesty&apos;s  Government believed that they  were  showing the&apos; fullestconsideration  for the position of France and Belgium, as well as ensuring the more effective guarantee  of continued and steady payments, when they suggested  that theoccupation would naturally terminate from the moment that guarantees or  pledges,less  economically harmful,  and more effectively productive, than the occupation o-the  Ruhr,  should  have  been not merely  devised  and  obtained, but seen to be satisfactorily  operating.   43. Even this suggestion is met by a definite refusal.   Both the French and theBelgian Governments emphatically declare that there can be no question of evacua-
                &apos;  j&apos;!                &apos;  7.&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;.tion  except in  proportion as payments are  made  by the German Government.Complete  evacuation  is  apparently not  contemplated until  the  total german reporation liability is  integrally discharged.    The  reiterated announcements tothis effect, coupled with  the  insistence  on leaving undiminished the total  of  132milliards of German  indebtedness  under the head  of reparations, can only be interpreted as an intention to remain in occupation of the Ruhr for a number of years,which, at best, cannot be less than 36 (this being the minimum period over which thedischarge of the debt is spread under the Schedule of  Payments) and which, in viewof the generally admitted improbability of the complete execution of the Schedulebeing found practicable under any circumstances, may be extended indefinitely, ifnot in perpetuity.  44. Such a situation,  of which the  political,  quite  apart  from  the economic,consequences could only be described as disastrous,  cannot but be viewed by  HisMajesty&apos;s Government with the  greatest concern.  It would vividly conjure  up thedanger of international relations being affected in a manner threatening to  use the words of the 11th article of  the Covenant of  the League of Nations to disturbinternational peace and the good understanding  between nations upon which peacedepends.   His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot believe that the  French and belgian governments will be able to  reconcile  the opinion of the world to the indefinitemaintenance of so perilous a situation.  45. As it is, the occupation of the Ruhr is already having directly and indirectly a grave effect on the economic and industrial outlook,  not  only in Germany, whosecapacity to pay reparations is rendered more and more precarious, but in the rest ofEurope) if not the world, and not least in this country.  46. In their note of the  20th July His Majesty&apos;s Government further proposed thatin order to arrive at a comprehensive plan for a general and final financial settlement,.inter-Allied discussions should  be opened  with as little  delay as possible.   The-Belgian Government reply that they will be glad to discuss such a plan if it be of thecharacter that they have predicated in their note.  The French Government, whilstquestioning the  propriety and apparently the legality of the suggestion,  asks whatexactly  it means  and  whether  it  will   include  the question  of  inter-allied debts.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government gladly avail themselves  of this opportunity to-explain their attitude on this subject.  I have accordingly the honour to enclose aseparate  memorandum upon it.   The  main principle  of  the  British schemeis  that Great Britain  is  ready,  subject to the just  claims  of  other parts  of  theEmpire, to limit her demands for payment by  the Allies and by Germany together to  a net sum approximating 14-2 milliards of gold marks, this sum  representing thepresent value of the recently funded British debt to the United States Government.The concessions  which  His Majesty&apos;s Government may  be able to offer in respectof inter-Allied debts must accordingly depend largely on the  percentage of this sumof 14-2 milliards  which  they can  recover  from Germany.   They can only begranted in a substantive  form when the general reparation settlement for  whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government are  pressing has been agreed  upon, and is  such thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government  can regard their share of the  German  payments as anasset of real financial value.  47. To this end the first step must be to fix the maximum sum which the Allies  can reasonably hope to recover from Germany, to be followed, or accompanied, by arrange-raents which will  ensure  the effective re-establishment of  Germany&apos;s finances  and credit on a sound basis, and will guarantee the punctual payment of the German debtby a system of control free from the economically&quot;unsound  impediments inherent inthe military occupation  of the Ruhr.  48. In  the last paragraph of  their letter, His Majesty&apos;s  Government  offered todiscuss sympathetically the question of future  security with their Allies.   TheBelgian Government warmly welcome this offer.   They will not, however, have failedto  notice  the remark of the French Government  that the object has  nothing to do with the  Ruhr,  and the consequent further  postponement of the discussion to anunnamed  date in the future.  The Belgian Government will recollect from the dis-cussions of 1922 that Flis  Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to enter into any arrangement respecting the territorial security of Belgium  apart from  a similar arrangement in regard to France.   Having regard to the&apos;now declared indifference ofthe French Government, no useful purpose can be served by pursuing the matter.
  49. The argument which has been put forward in this note may be summarised asfollows:   50. His Majesty&apos;s  Government have at no  time  contemplated and  do not  nowcontemplate that Germany shall  be relieved  from all reparation payments.  Theyare determined that Germany shall pay,  up to the  maximum of her capacity, thereparation to which Great Britain, equally with the other Allied Powers, is entitled,and  which is needed  to make good the losses sustained by this country in common with her  Allies.  51. What Germany&apos;s maximum capacity for payment may be is a matter whichshould be determined by impartial enquiry into the facts,  ft cannot be ascertainedby  casting  up  the  amounts  which  Grermany&apos;s creditors  would  like  to  receive.To  ask  for more  than  Germany&apos;s  maximum  capacity cannot  assist  in  theactual recovery of reparations.  It can only  destroy the assets which Germany can offer to the  Allies.   To force  liquidation  is not the  most profitable way of makingrecovery  from a debtor with resources.  52. It  is admitted that Germany can only make substantial payments if, by therestoration of her public finance and  a stabilisation of her currency,  a  surplus  ismade available for reparation on her budget.  Moreover, this surplus must be in a form in  which it can be made available for  external payments over  the foreignexchanges.   External debts, cannot be  paid by the collection of depreciating papermarks.   In  the  view of  His Majesty&apos;s Government forcible interference with theeconomic life of Germany,  even if it be consistent with the terms of  the  Treaty ofVersailles, cannot assist  in the necessary restoration.  Not only will it  prevent the realisation of any  surplus for reparation,  but, by intensifying the  disorder ofGerman finance and currency,  it will have the gravest reactions on trade.  53. His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, regard as doomed to failure the methodpursued by the French and Belgian Governments to secure reparations.   In spiteof wholesale seizures, the occupation of the Ruhr by France and Belgium has produced, at great cost, less receipts for the Allies,  notably of coal and coke, thanwere forthcoming in the previous year.  Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government feelthat the  resulting situation  involves  great  and growing danger to the peacefultrade of  the world and, not  least, of this country.   His Majesty&apos;s  government regard a  continuance of the present position as fraught with the gravest risks, botheconomic and political.  They consider the impartial fixation of  Germany&apos;s liabilityat a figure not inconsistent  with her practical power of making payment a matter ofgreat urgency;  and they have suggested what appears to them to be an  appropriate means to this end.  54. When  steps  have  thus  been  taken   to  ascertain  the  real  value  ofthe  asset  represented  by  German  reparations,  and to secure its  realisationwithout  further  depreciation,  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  will  be  ready todeal  as   generously as   circumstances  permit,  and,  in  the light  of theirrespective  capacity  to   pay,   with  the  debts  due   to   Great    Britain   by her  allies.  - They  cannot,   having   regard  to  the  heavy  material  losses  ofthis country,  both during and  since  the  war, and  to  the  future tax burdens on its trade, admit  that other countries  are justified in claiming  that the  agreedpercentages of reparation payments should now be further modified  or changedin order  of  priority.  But they remain prepared to ask for no more in respect ofthe very large sums due by their allies  than will, together with reparation payments by Germany, meet the British war debt to the United  States Government.   Theirpolicy in this matter is stated in the British proposal laid by Mr. Bonar Law beforethe Paris Conference in January last, and has not changed.  It means that GreatBritain would be prepared  to waive, in the interest of a complete general settlement,a very large part of the  amount  for which  the British taxpayer holds the  dueobligations of Allied Governments.  55. It  is the hope of Plis Majesty&apos;s  Government that the above explanations  willconvince the French and Belgian Governments of the reasonableness of the british position,  and will win  their assent  to  its  acceptance.   They are reluctant to contemplate the possibility that separate action may be required in order to hasten asettlement which cannot be much longer delayed without the gravest consequences tothe recovery of trade and the peace of the world.                                           I have, &amp;c.                                               CURZON OF KEDLBSTON.
Enclosure in No. 1.                     Memorandum on Inter-Allied Debts.  1. IT is in  the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government hopeless to deal  satis-factorily with  the question of inter-Allied debts until  a &apos; better estimate is madeof the amounts which Great Britain, on  the  one hand, and  her Allies, on  theother, are likely in fact to be able to recover from Germany for reparations.  2. His Majesty&apos;s  Government adhere to  the policy,  which  their predecessorshave formally  announced, of limiting  Great  Britain&apos;s total  claim  against  herAllied debtors and Germany together to  the amount necessary to cover the Britishdebt to the United  States  Government, which, as recently funded, may be  takento be represented, on a 5-per-cent. basis, by a sum of 14&quot;2 milliards of gold marks,present value.  This basis  is already exceedingly favourable to the Allies as  theBritish  debt  to the United  States  Government  cannot be  redeemed on suchfavourable terms.  3. This offer, in effect, means that Great  Britain (whose material war damageswere not  less than one-third of those suffered  by France) is content  to forgo  herrights to  reparation under all  heads, and to  treat her own share of  the Germanpayments as if it were a reimbursement  by her Allies of  their debts to her.  4. Nay,  the  total  amount  for which  she asks from  the Allies  and  Germanytogether is, in fact, less than the amount of  the Allied debts, being  limited to  thetotal of the British debt  to the United  States Government, without regard  eitherto loans raised by Great  Britain in the  open American market or to  the value ofthe American securities (estimated at 700,000,000/. to 800,000,000/.) used to finance the Allied  cause in America  before the entry of the  United States into the war,the  loss of which, from the economic  point of view,   is the equivalent of  the contracting of an equal amount of foreign debt.  5. Of the sum of 14&apos;2 milliards gold marks, Great Britain is anxious to recover as large a percentage as possible from Germany, in order to be able  to offer  themaximum concessions feasible in  regard to  inter-Allied  debts.   But  it  is  notpossible for her to grant such concessions in a substantive form unless and until such a reparation settlement  has been arrived  at as will enable her to regard hershare of the German payments as an asset of real financial value.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  greatly fear that a persistence in the policy indicated  in the French note will make the prospects  of such a settlement remote.  6. The only practical manner in which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, the  question of inter-Allied debts can now be approached, is for the  allies to agree in the first instance  upon the maximum sum which they can reasonablyhope to recover from Germany.  &quot;When such an agreement has been arrived at,  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government will be prepared  (provided that the settlement  is such as tomake the German obligation a reasonably good asset) to write down, with due regardto the different circumstances of the respective debtors, the Allied debts owing tothem, to an amount representing the difference between the British  share of  thevevised German obligation and the British debt of 14&apos;2 milliards to the United StatesGovernment, and  even to consider  accepting  payment of  the Allied debts soreduced in the form of the new German obligations  on the principles laid clownin the plan presented by Mr.  Bonar Law at the Paris  Conference in January last.  7. They cannot, however, conceal from  the French Government the  fact thatthis latter suggestion is  less  attractive  to them than it was then, since  the deterioration in the financial prospects of Gerniarjiy, resulting, as they hold, fromthe unwise policy pursued by the  French and Belgian Governments, has madethe security represented by German reparation  bonds much more precarious (evenif the total obligations should be reduced below the  figure contemplated, by  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government seven  months ago).*  .n\ His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound to observe in this  connection that  the willingness which they and  their predecessors  have shown  to discuss with  theFrench Government arrangements under which the burden of  the French debt toGreat Britain  might be mitigated must  not  be interpreted as a waiver on their part of their rights as creditors, which are governed solely by  the contracts  underwhich the money was advanced and the securities which they hold.  J- That a  French Government Treasury bill given to the British  Government or value received is a less binding obligation than a similar bill given to a private
investor is a doctrine  inadmissible both in itself and more especially in view 0fthe circumstances in which these particular loans were contracted.  10.  The normal course would have been for  the French Government to appealdirectly to the British investor for the accommodation  it required, and  that procedure was in fact  adopted for a short  period at the commencement of thewar.  It  soon became  apparent, however, that the French Government would be unable to raise on its own credit amounts sufficient  to meet its sterling require-ments, and the British Government  stepped in and gave its own securities to the lender for  the amounts raised  to cover French  requirements  as well as British.By  this means  the French  Government were able to  borrow  indirectly  fromBritish lenders both on less  onerous terms and  to a larger amount than wouldhave been possible  if the normal  procedure had  been followed.  The payments due on the French Treasury bills  thus represent  amounts which  the british treasury is in fact paying to  the holders of securities issued on  behalf of theFrench Treasury of which the French Treasury received the proceeds.  . ,.  11.  There was  no suggestion when the loans were made that the repaymentshould be dependent on recoveries from Germany.  Indeed, during  the greaterpart of the  period  covered by the advances, the prospects of any such recoverieswere highly problematical.  The bills were made subject to renewal  for a limited period only after the  end  of  the war, with  the clear intention that as  soon asFrench credit was  sufficiently  re-established they  should  be redeemed  out ofFrench Government loans to be raised  on  the London  market,  the redemptionmoney being applied to the cancellation of the  British securities issued on Frenchaccount.  12.  While  His Majesty&apos;s Government have, by continuing to  renew the billsbeyond the period of the  contract, tacitly recognised that the time has not yet arrived for giving effect  to this intention, it  must be clearly understood that, inthe absence of a new agreement, the  carrying out  of it remains an obligation ofthe French Government which cannot honourably be repudiated, and that, in themeantime, the present  practice of adding interest to capital cannot be indefinitelycontinued, and that a  commencement of payment of at  any rate  a  part of theinterest should be made as soon as the sterling-franc  exchange becomes reasonablystable.
