COMMUNISTS     has CommuniBli Party intends to hold a special autumn propaganda campaign ana has sent the following preliminary notices to the  committees  concerned:          &quot;The  Executive committee are  organising a great     campaign on  October 7th,  the object heing to focus     the attention of  the  workers on the pressing problems     that faoe  them, and how the Party proposes to meet them.          &quot;A programme and policy is now fceing worked out and     you will be  supplied  with all details latter.          &quot;The  campaign will follow on  a visit by the     National Organiser to all the more important Districts     and Locale where ho will  carry out the following plan.      (1)  Address an aggregate meeting  of all members, at          whioh the new tasks  ana: policy of the party will          he outlined.  Explain  the urgency for the new          method  of organisation to be  completed  and our.          nuclei  particularly  in the  trade unions to he          established  as soon  as possible.      fa)  Meet  the District party Committee or local Party          Committee  aa the case  may bet follov/ing on the          aggregate meeting, and discuss the practical          measures necessary for carrying out the new tasks.      (3)  Settle  any  difficulties that  may have arisen between          the Districts and the  Centre  or differences that may          ezist in the Distriets or Locals.          &quot;This job  is espected  to he completed, by  October      14th and a platform campaign will  commence by  holding      four demonstrations  in various parts of London on      Ootober 7th,, This will then free  all our national      speakers for the  demonstrations which we shall hold  in      our provincial  centres on Sunday,,  October 14th.           &quot;When these  demonstrations are over, the publicity      achieved will be  taken advantage  of by all our Districts      end Locals carrying  out an  organised campaign  through      the  trade  union branches.  Details of this will he      supplied later..          ,;It is  important that,  your  Committee  should get      busy immediately.   Below you will find the  dates when      the  Organiser will he in  your District, please see to it      that the meetings asked for are well organised and      arranged..

The expenses attached      to  the tour  of  the Organiser will  be borne by  the  Centre,
     only each District or local is expected to provide his     hospitality while he is in the District.         &quot;The oost of the demonstrations will have to he     &quot;borne by a national appeal.   The first job is to get the     women members busy on the social side,  and definitely     fix Saturday, October 13th, as the day  on which every     local and District is running some sort of social     function, the proceeds of which are to be sent to     Headquarters to form a common fund out  of which the     expanses incurred in the Demonstrations can be met.  Of     course, most of them should pay for themselves hut we     must take precautions.         &quot;The Executive look with confidence for the whole-     hearted co-operation of yourself, and your committee.     This cemi&amp;campaign is only the commencement  of real big things.

Webb     The  issue  of &quot;The Workers1  Weekly&quot; dated August  18thdevoted  a good  deal of space  to  the  situation in Germany:some passages from the leader are  not without interest:          &quot;The  only improvement  in the situation of the     workers and the  lower middle  class can come from the     destruction of the finanoial  tyranny,  the seizure of  real     values by the State  and  the fixing of the workers&apos; pay     in terms of real values.  Such drastic measures can only     be oarried through by a  workers&apos; Government.          &quot;The  situation of the  German workers is only a     foretaste  of the situation of the workers in every     country in Europe,  por  all alike, soon or late, must     come the same realisation of the hopelessness of any  -     recovery under world capitalism, and the necessity     of open struggle with the bourgeoisie.  Just as the     madness of the old Tsarist regime, aided and pushed on     by the British and French bourgeoisie, led to the first     breach of the bourgeois  world system.in Russia,  so the     same madness to-day is leading to the second break in     Germany.          &quot;We communists welcome the breakdown of the     barbarous and criminal system imposed on Europe by the     Treaty of Versailles.  We are one with the German workers     in their struggle through all its dark and difficult     future fortunes, and we  see in that struggle the brightest     light of hope for the future  of the world...          &quot;Let the British and  French workers be ready.  It     is not for us to waste our time denouncing Poincare as     the enemy and cheering on Baldwin and Curson.  Ourbusiness/

At the Party Council  nfoioh is to  be held on August25th  and  26th,  W.

(2)   How it  is to be carried out.     (3)   The specific tasks as allocated.&quot;     The London District Party Committee has recentlyconducted  an  enquiry  into  the present  position of theLondon  movement in  order to form an estimate of theresults obtained  under  the first few months&apos; working of thenew organisation:  the  conclusions reaohed by the committeeare not uninteresting:                              &quot;The/

This means that about  twenty-five par cent  of the Party  members sirs doing this...      &quot;Only about thirty  per cent of  the  Party members are fully paid up. Of course a good many may not  be paid tip simply because their  area  groups have not  met and the group  leaders haw  not requested payment.., Mambershlp has deolined      &quot;This is  not * disheartening  feature.  It was to he expected when the  new form of organisation was introduce a, and in fact  has been far less than was anticipated. Some locals are not working      &quot;Tliie cannot he  taken as a condemnation of  the  new form of organisation. Many if not most  of the old branches did not really  work. Our working membership is larger      &quot;It is a  fact that  although the percentage  of workers is siill small we have a larger  number actually working than at any previous time. The results are organised results      &quot;It is a fact that  the results  that have been obtained from the house  to house work,  upon whioh  the area groups generally were  expected  to conoentrate,  are more tangible  than previous results.   The circulation of the Workers&apos; Weekly increased  over 100 per cent, and this increase is  a stable increase.   In most oases the customers  are known and are  a  definite oontact with our supporters. That we laok experience  in leadership      &quot;By this  we do not  refor to political leadership in the general sense of  the word, we believe that  eo far as political lead is conoerned the party Bxeoutive has consistently supplied it.  What we refer to is organising leadership in the  looels;  that generally speaking our local party committees  and  group leaders are not comrades capable of holding  their groups and members together.  This fault is  the main centre of difficulty.  We have  for so long been in the habit of leaving things to branch oomraittees, and sometimes only to a secretary and  treasurer, that  when a large number of other comrades are  oailed  upon to fill what are comparatively minor offioes,  they have not the technical nor  the natural qualifications.

Further, members BO expelled           by a District Committee should be reminded that,           they have  the right of appeal  to the  party           Exeoutive.

NOimprovements have been made in the machinery, nochange of leadership of the International organisations which submitted the Miners to the most ignominiousfiofeat recorded in the annals of working class history.(3)  REMEMBER THAT 1,250,000 TONS OF BELGIAN, FRENCH

Branches     of the Irish SeIf-Determination League in England and     Wales are practically dead although the Executive still     functions at 182,  Shaftesbury Avenue, the offioe rent     being paid by the Gaelic League of which it ia also  the     headquarters.          Most of the English Deportees Bigned the guarantee     to hand over  50 of their compensation money  to Art     0&apos;Brien&apos;s defence fund, but the Scottish Deportees have     flatly refused to do so.  It is possible  that in the end     very  little of the compensation money will go to Art     0&apos;Brien.                                                       fhe /
     2he new London Irish League is attracting a fairamount of attention by it a meetings in Hyde Park:  itsspeakers are irresponsible young men, who makeastonishing statements as to the position in Ireland,and are sub jeoted to a good deal of interruption andridicule, but who have a certain following ofexcitable young Irish men and women.     Do Valora&apos;s arrest has attracted very littleattention here:  it waa expected and, although manydoubt its wisdom, most people agree that it could notbe avoided.      The Glasgow area is still the most active centre of Irish Republicanism:  most of the clubs meetregularly and occasional Irish Republican Army drills(without arms) still take place.  Delegates from all theoluba are to meet at 171, Renfield Street on August 25thto discuss  the question of propaganda by means of openair meetings.  A resolution, passed by the Liem MellowsClub, condemning &quot;the governing body in Scotland ofthe Republican Movement&quot; for not carrying out its duties  efficiently,  and asserting that &quot;it no longeroommands the  confidence of  its followers,&quot; is also to bediscussed.      A  few  of the leading  lights, including MaryKelson  an ex-deportee, left  on  Sunday last for Dublin totake  part  In  the election  struggle but most of those selected have  not been sent  owing to lack of funds.
