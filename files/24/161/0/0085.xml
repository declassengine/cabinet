llHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITABHIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)I *CR E T. ).P. 365 jg.3)OA B I NE T. AMENDMEHTS-TO AHTICI&amp;E 10 OF TH3QQYMIIFOF.....THE&quot; LEAGUE OF&quot;&quot;SATIQIS.(Memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil).     I did not see these proposed instructions before they were printed and circulated ana regret this the moreas I do not altogether agree with them.     In the(first place I oannot quite aooept the reading of Article 10 that it &quot;imposes a heavy burden on the stronger States in the League for the benefit of theweaker.&quot;  The objeot of Article 10 seems to be very wellstated in the second baragraph of the interpretativeresolution of the Balfour Committeej viz: &quot;to enunciatethe principle that hereafter the civilised world oannottolerate aots of aggression as a means of modifying theterritorial status quo and the political independence ofthe States&quot;.     That is  a principle of great importance ovoti to the strongest states.   It is the foundation on whioh any permanent peaoe must be built.   To a commercial  State likethe British Empire it is at least as vital as to any other country.     Next, I  do not know on what grounds it is suggestedthat an interpretative resolution can be passed  by amajority of the Assembly.   Article 5 of the Covenant seems
                                                 i   645 quite precise in requiring unanimity  for any decision of either Council or Assembly except where otherwise provided., It is true  that in praotioe resolutions passed by a majority are,treated  as recommendations; that,  is, expressions of opinion which bind nobody.  But for an interpretative resolution this would  seem of little  value.      Apart from these  minor criticisms I doubt the- wisdom of the  pdlicy recommended.  I have always understood that the main object  of the Canadian Delegation&apos;in seeking to amend Artialo  10 was to soften the hostility of tho U.S.A. to the  League.   Possibly the Balfour interpretative reaplu- tion passed unanimously without amendment might have that effect.  But  if  it woro amended as proposed in Annex 4 it would do more  harm than good,   hn assertion - unwarranted I think by anything in the  Covenant - that the League stood in the  lest resort for aggressive conquest would finally blast its prospeots in America.   Yet such an amendment might easily be carried.  Again if a considerable minority or possibly a majority voted against the Resolution the effect in the L.S. might be very bad.  Finally,  even if the most acceptable interpretation or amendment of  Article-10 couldbe passed unanimously I doubt whether it  is desirable at  thepresent moment.  Nothing has dona the League more harm in the States  than the despairing language unad  by some of itsadherents about its prospects without the  entry of America,And to  offer all sorts of inducements to  her to accept  iths3 something of the seme effect.   In my  judgment tho league should make no more offers to tho  United  Stated but  await  herproposals.  If and when the United  Stutes  suggests entry  on certain terms  the League would doubtless, give the most
     favourable consideration to those  suggestions. Till  then     the League&apos;would  So woll to go on  with its work without &apos;     bothering too much about the attitude  of America.          I should therefore  recommend  a repetition of our action     last year,  viz; the adjournment of the whole question.  There     are good  grounds  for this oourso apart from anything to do     with the  United Statos.   Article 10 never has been used and     as fsr as one can  see  it is  never  likely to be used.  In     any case  it  commits no one  to  anything beyond authorising     the Council  to &quot;advise&quot;  and  that can only be done by a-.&apos;.     unanimous vote in  which  the  representative of the British     Empire would  have  to  concur.   There is therefore no urgency     about  dealing with the matter  at present.  Moreover as     several of the Governments have  pointed out Article 10 is     closely related to the proposed  Treaty of Mutual Assistance     and it is premature  to discuss  it  till we know what will be     tho fate  of  the Treaty.   If  it  is  passed by the Assembly and     accepted  by  the bulk of  the  Members of tho League&apos;the rescision     of Article 10 might become very  desirable.          I suggest therefore  that  it is hazardous and  even     undesirable  to press for  tha amendment of Article  10 or for     its interpretation, and  it would be better to postpone all     action on the subject for the  present.                                   (Intd.)  H.O.13th  August, 19:43.
