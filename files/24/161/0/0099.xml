Details are given of the recent meeting of ihe partyCouncil of the Communist Party of  Great Britain at whioh thefuture policy and the reorganisation at headquarters werefleoiaed.                                  ,     Information regarding the extent to whioh Moscow controls the activities of the Red International  of Labour Unions inGreat Britain is given in this report.     The activity of the Communist Party and of the BedInternational of Labour Unions inside the trade unions isBteadlly increasing.     Although it is  not yet possible to estimate the national,^fect of the reorganisation of the Young Communist League of west Britain, Uie movement in London is supported by a particularly sotive  type of propagandist.
TEE COMMUNISTS          A full nee ting of the ptorty Council of the Communist&apos;     Party was held in London on August 25th-27th:  provincial     delegates received sums varying from 30/- to  5 for their     expenses.          The official report of the proceedings contains a     good deal of information regarding the future policy of the     British Party and the reorganisation at Headqiiarters by     which it is hoped to give effect to the decisions reached.               &quot;The Party Council received the decisions          reached by the International at the special Enlarged          Executive meeting in Jims,  (in Moscow,)&apos; and in          particular the special decisions on the British Party.        \\       &quot;The reports from the Enlarged Executive meeting          were presented by Gallacher and Butt.               &quot;The International Executive, it was reported,          had to face  a situation in which the whole position  on          the Continent was presenting decisive issues, and to          that extent  the British situation v/as an isolated and          peculiar problem.  Nevertheless, the weakness of tho          movement in  Britain and the backwardness of the British          working class was recognised by ginoyiev as 5the          Achilles&apos; heel of the International,&quot; which would have          to receive speoial and concentrated attention.               &quot;On the Continent, revolutionary mass parties of          the workers  were already  in existence.  In prance,          Germany and  the leading countries, the  sections of the          Communist International dominated working class.          politics and action.  The problem was no longer the          problem of achieving a mass party:  it wag the problem          of the conquest of power.   This meant en extension of          the tactics  cf the United -pront.  Hot merely  was it -a          question of  winning the workers, but cf kLnitiag all          the lower and middle groups below the big bourgeoisie          into a combination to overthrow the*big bourgeoisie-.          The slogan of-the Workers&quot;  Government was developed          to the slogan of the workers * and Peasants&quot;          Government.  The workers; the peasants  and the petty          Bourgeoisie, or clerks and  small officials, would have          to be rallied to a single struggle:  only so  oould  ,          theywin...               n...The Communist policy was to make a          combination  of the lower  elements against Big Capital          (Stinnes, etc.)...               &quot;In Bpite of the differenoes of the situation in          Britain, the same tactical principle arose in another
form.   In Britain the problem in front was still theconquest ef the working class, the arousing of theworking class to united action.   There was no doubtthat every manifestation, the Labour vote at elections,the trade union ballots, the spontaneous and unofficial strikes against heavy odds, showed the readiness an$desire of the workers for united action.     &quot;But at present there stood In the way there-actionary policy of the official leaders and the:.petty seetlonalism of the opposition.   There was no-doubt that the reactionary policy of Thomas, dynesjj.Webb, ate, did  not represent the feelings or tha \-wishes of the mass of ordinary workers.   But there&apos;;had,so far, been no effective attempt to remove the st,beoause those opposed to them were too much taken up with their own quarrels about their respectiveorganisations and positions.   What was necessary wasto get all elements together in a common fight.   5fi$Communist Earty oould only win leadership by itsachievements in the common fight.  The danger to avoidwas sectarianism, and preaching of ^ure&apos; revolutionarydoctrine with isolation from the oommon fight.  It was .necessary to know how to combine with elements; with.-whom we did not agree and whom in future we mighthave to fight against.  At the same time In all suchooramon action it was neoessary to maintain very clearly the separate existence of our own party and our own1-propaganda.  Our members were still weak and easilylost themselves in other organisations.   The re fore ,v&quot;;-itwas very important to keep up the Party organisation;-and contact most energetically.  To be able to enter:ffreely and unhesitatingly&apos; into the most neoessarycommon aotion and combination for the moment, but toremain in them throughout first and foremost a Party-oonscious member - that was the test of trueCommunism.     &quot;The British situation was explored in detail by the International over a protracted series of       ;sessions, and the various questions of policy and innerdifficulties of the Party were fully ventilated.  A  *v?series of detailed decisions were reached, whioh were,communicated to the Party Council, and, after carefuldiscussion, ratified.                                %     &quot;Certain changes were made in the arrangements of the Executive Committee and centre.  In order tointroduce new blood into the Executive, additions wer*made, as follows:-          Comrade Hannington  (of the Unemployed);     ; ^          Comrade Horner (of the South Wales Miners);          Comrade J.R. Campbell (Editor of the                                 Glasgow Sorter1).     &quot;A new Political Bureau of seven was established to be the daily directing organ of the Party, under  !-the Executive Committee, which would meet at longerintervals.  The Political Bureau was composed asfollows:/
     follow.  Boll, Butt, Gallaoher, Mucmanus, Pollitt,     of the existing Executive Committee, with the additions     of Hannington and Horner of the new members of the     Executive Committee:  and as substitute Members, Canpbell     and ifewbold.  In addition, changes were made affecting     the offices of the Party,  The political secretaryship     was suspended. . With regard to the. Organising Secretary,     it was decided that he should attend the political     Bureau with a consultative vote.  Individual tasks were?     allotted to the members of the Political Bureau.  General     Party oampaigns and organisation were brought under the;     supervision of Pollitt, Butt was to be in charge of the     Party Organ and to be the representative of the     Exeoutive on the young Communist League.  Gallacher would     be already fully occupied with his work in connection   I     with the Red International of, Labour Unions,  Bell was  j     to be in charge of agitation ana propaganda.  MaoManus  I     was to be in charge of parliamentary and colonial work. I          &quot;Speoial emphasis was laid by the International     on certain aspects of the Party&apos;s work, particularly the     youth movement and the press.                           \          &quot;The better development  of the Youth movement was     stressed as&apos;Indispensable to  the future of the  Party.     In a strong Youth movement lay  the strength and reserve^     of every leading Communist Party.          &quot;The development of tho  Party organ and the hard     work put in upon it by the whole party was received     with warm approval by the International,  They  especially     appreoiated the sucoess of the  system of distribution by     our members, the Workers1 Life  and reports, and the change -     in the character of the contents.                       ?t          &quot;They  stressed very strongly the importance of     carrying it forward as rapidly  as possible, and it was  &quot;     agreed that we should prooeed to an enlargement of the     paper and a bi-weekly as soon as we were  strong enough  ..     to do it, and go forward with concrete  plans for a     workers&apos; daily...&quot;     The funds of the communist Party are reported to be low&apos;at the moment.   Proude&apos;s are pressing for the payment of their  outstanding acoount for printing and  &quot;The tyorkere&apos; Weekly&quot; will in  future be printed  by the Caledonian  Press. It is  said that  only  3,000 members are at present paying their  subscriptions.     All District Party  Committees and groups  are being urged  to  strain  every nerve to collect money for the Autumn Campaign:  the Manchester District Party Committee,  for
                                                          Q&apos;3instructed its Locals to arrange at least one &quot;socialfunction whereby  a profit will accrue to the  1,000 fund,&quot;     The Communist Party ia particularly active among the railwaymen and has issued to oertain selected members theproposals alleged to have been drawn up by the railwaycompanies for modification of conditions of service in thevarious grades:  the -Party has also drafted a minimumprogramme for the National Union of Railwaymen, the out stand-ing points of which are:          &quot;The  3 minimum for all adults.           The guaranteed day and wee Jr. for all.           The recognition for all holidays.           The 6ight hours over all.         w  Every man a Trade Unionist.&quot;     It has now been decided to transfer a section of theSouth Wales District Industrial Committee from Cardiff toPorth:  the Porth committee will be under the leadership ofPrank Bright and will function as the mining section:industries other than mining will still be dealt with by theexisting industrial committee in Cardiff.  As Arthur Hornerof Hardy, is now a member of the Central Executive Committeeand of the political Bureau his attendance at meetings ofthe South Wales District Party Committee is considered essential and his travelling expenses will be defrayed byHeadquarters.     District and Local seotions have been instructed by communist headquarters that they must support the autumncampaign of the Workers1 International Russian Relief withthe object of &quot;tightening up the organisation machinery...and completing the campaign for the first Workers1 Loan to soviet Russia.&quot;   The confidential circular continues:-          &quot;In particular the Vjorkers&apos; International Russian     Relief desire the establishment of a Workers&apos;     International Russian Relief Local Committee in every     large town.          &quot;These should act under the guidance of the Local                                                    Trades/
     Trades  Council,  who  should he asked  to nominate  two or     three members  to serve  on such a  Committee,  delegates     from various local political, and  industrial bodies,     also being invited.          &quot;The  scope  of  suoh local Committees  would be  as     follows:-     (1)   Continue  agitation for  full  &quot;de jure&quot;  recognition  of          Soviet Russia.     (2)   Taking charge  of the campaign for Economic          Relief for  Soviet Russia by  means of the first          Workers&apos;  loan.     (3)   Propaganda  for  the maintenance of tho  Famine          Orphans in  the  Children&apos;s Homes in. soviet Russia          maintained  by  the British Section  of the Workers&apos;          International  Russian Relief - this  by means  of  a          sub-committee  composed  mainly of women workers.     (4)   Making arrangements for Russian Films  to be          shown in  the area.     (5)   By means  of Concerts, lectures, Artistic and          Musical evenings where  a dominant  Russian  note          is struck to maintain and  foster solidarity with          Russia.     (6)   To take charge of sales of  Soviet  Russia Pictorial          as the organ of the W.&quot;I.R*Ro Movement  and  of          other pro-Russian Literature.          In setting up  these committees the  main part  of     the  work will  have  to be done by  communists, but the     work should have as far as possible a non-party     character.  Most; of the largest  Trades  Councils - London,     Birmingham, Falkirkj etc, have  already  endorsed the     work of the W.I.R.Ru and the Workers&apos; Loan.,  The last     conference of  the Independent Labour Party  also     endorsed the first  Workers1  Loan.&quot;     The  Kommunistische  Partei Loutsehlends  has  informed the Communist party of Great Britain that the  &quot;Internationalof Ex-Serviee Men and Victims of  the  War&quot; of  which HenriBarbusse  is the chairman, is holding  a conference in Berlinfrom September 20th - October 2nd at  which England,  France,Germany,  Austria, Belgium, Poland,  Italy, Greece and  Bulgariawill be represented^    The Communist  Party of Great  britain has been requested  to get into touch immediately with theEnglish delegates in order to secure  expression  of thecommunist standpoint  at  the conference.

These are the first letters         and the first information on the activity of the         British1Bureau since the R.I.L.U* plenum.  It would         seem that after an interval of nearly two months,  we had         the right to expect exhaustive information on the  work         of the British Bureau^              &quot;Unfortunately, your letters give no idea of  the         work of the British Bureau at all.  No mention whatever:         of the execution of the decisions adopted by the         Executive Bureau of the K.I.L.U. on July 10th - though         it. is of great importance for us to know just how  you         intend to give shape to the opposition within the         British trade union movement, what you have done in the         matter of preparing for a national Conference of the         Left Wing, and finally, how you carry on your agitation         and propaganda at present.  Your letters give no         indication of anything done in this respect, nor do we         know whether you are drawing up a program of action for         the various industries, whether you have issued any         slogans and started a campaign for industrial unionism,         or what your relations are with the Central Committee of         the Communist Party.              &quot;You are, of course, aware of the fact that the         decisions of the Executive Bureau of the R.I.L.U.  are         obligatory upon all its affiliated organisations.   All the         responsible members of these organisations and         especially the representatives of our Bureau, must do         everything within their power to have these decisions         carried out.  Inasmuch as you do not report of your         work in connection with these decisions, we get the      1         impression that you have done nothing, that you have         undertaken nothing, that the British Bureau is just as         inaotive as before.  This impression is even strengthened!         by the total lack of any information on the attitudeI         of the British Bureau towards the current events in the;         British Labour movement.              &quot;After all, you have had lately a tremendous  movement         of the dockworkers;  something seems to be brewing in         the metal, mining and transport industries.  Then  there         is also the next congress of the British Trade Unions,   \         0&apos;G-rady&apos;s activities, etc.   It is hard to get reconciledto/m 6 MI
* 7 -839     to  the idea that the British Bureau has no opinion of     its own, no line of action on all those questions.  !This:     would he an extremely sad situation;  this, indeed, is  :     entirely inadmissible on the part of our representatives     in  Great Britain.          &quot;You are urgently requested to advise us without     delay just what the British Bureau is actually doing.     How does it respond to the important events in Great     Britain?  what has been done to line up the revolutionary     workers within the transport, mining, metal and other     reformist unions?  -And finally, why have you not yet     carried out the instructions of the R.I.L.U., issued-by     its Executive Bureau on July 10th.          &quot;As regards your opinion on the futility of     circulating the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot;     Bulletins among the British &quot;workers, we cannot possibly     agree,   Everyone of us knows only too well, the     backwardness of the British proletariat;  we are also     perfectly aware of its inertness;, of the craft spirit     and bourgeois traditions which play such an important     role  in the life of the British labour organisations.     However, all this will never be changed unless the true     road  of the struggle is pointed out, unless we attempt     to  rouselthe class-consciousness of the British masses.     It  is for such work of agitation and propaganda that our     bulletins are published-  You may introduce certain     changes in the British text of these bulletins-  However,     they  should be published and circulated as widely as     possible among the British workers,  v/e therefore urge     upon  you to give up your passivity in the matter of the     bulletins and take up actively, both the publication and     distribution of seine.          &quot;We shall expect a report of your activities in     this  field in your next letter.          &quot;We wish to repeat that the British Bureau must     develops most energetic activities right now, immediately,     and at  all costs.  We hope that you realise this full well     yourselves, and that your future letters will show it.&quot;     With  this letter was enclosed an extract from the minutesof the meeting of the Executive Bureau held in Moscow onJuly 10th, 1923:  this  document reads as under;     &quot;Reported:     (1)   Membership and activities of the British Bureau of     the Red International of Labour Unions.  Comrade Loaovsky     announced the decisions of the Committee.     Resolved:     (1)   To approve the following composition of the British     Bureau of  the Red  International of Labour Unions:     Comrades Tom Mann, lismer, watkins, Campbell, Gallacher,     hoy,  Tom Thomas, Thompson and Smith.   Comrades Gallacher     and Campbell to be the responsible secretaries for the     Bureau;  Comrade Watkins, responsible organiser for theminers/
    miners.   Comrade Thompson, organiser for the transport    workers.  Comrade Gallacher for the metal workers.         &quot;To approve the following decision of the Committee    regarding the ?;ork of the Bureau:    1.   It shall he the task of the British Bureau of the         B.I.LoU. in closest co-operation and contact with         the Communist Party of Great Britain, to         consolidate the opposition movement within the         British Trade Unions as speedily as possible;    2.   For this purpose all efforts of the Bureau, during         the next few months, should be concentrated on the         calling of a national conference of the opposition         groups within the unions, and on the creation, at         this&quot; conference, of a Trade Union Opposition         League j whose aim shall be the winning over of the         British trade unions to the B.I.L.U. - from within.    3.   In order that the conference may be attended by         the greatest number of trade unions and radical         local groups, it is necessary to concentrate the         entire propaganda and agitation on the practical         questions of the British trade union movements         Furthermore, the conference will have to take up         the solution of the practical problems confronting         the working class of Great Britain.    4*   The R.I.L.U. Bureau shall consist of nine members,       -  including special organisers for miners, metal         workers and transport workers.    5.   The R.I.X.U. Bureau shall decide upon the line and         character of the activities in the trade unions,         work out the programme of action for various         industries, formulate the basic slogans and         campaigns, and call industrial., district and national         conferences jointly with the representatives of the         Central Committee of the British Communist party.    6.   As soon as a central body representing the opposition         within the British trade union movement is elected,         and its affiliation to the R.I.L.TJ. becomes a fact,         the British Bureau of the R..I.L.U. wil^be liquidated,,    A well informed correspondent has sent the followingaccount of an address given by W. Gallacher at a secretoommunist meeting last week:         &quot;Gallacher pointed out how Great Britain was behind    other European oountries, and stated that the Party must    build up a fighting policy in the  Trade Unions, which    were the only organisations the workers had, and that if    the  bourgeoisie&apos; get control of them, which they are    trying to do through their representatives, the workers    will &quot;go further back into chaos3, not only the British,    but  the rest of Jjluropean workers.         &quot;He also said that the Minority movement in the    Trade Unions, directed by the Communist Party nuclei, is making/

Arising from this, a  Committee  was formed, composed    of  the two Executive  Councils,  to  sit continuously    from one year to another, working  and planning against    this country.&quot;                             *    &quot;The International Soamen&apos;s Section  of the InternationalPropaganda Committee  of Revolutionary  Transport workers  of theRed  International of  Labour Unions in Hamburg informedPollitt  on August 27th  that:          &quot;Last weak  at a  meeting  of the M.E.B. and the    Soajaen&apos;s Section it was  decided that  the British program    for seamen should be  drafted  immediately.   This is    already delayed  too long... It  should  not be necessary    to  wait until an organisation has  been formed before    drafting the program.  You ought  to be able to gather    around yourselves  enough revolutionary seamen who could    constitute themselves a  committee  to  give information                                                   upon/
     upon the seamen&apos;s conditions, etc.,  if you have no     one in the Bureau sufficiently acquainted with     conditions to write a program.   By this method  you     can commence drafting it  immediately,thus enabling our     committees in other countries to oommence distributing     propaganda amongst British seamen.  As soon as the     manuscript is ready and fully endorsed by the Bureau     you should forward a copy to Hamburg and we will     immediately put it on the press here.   You will under-     stand that this is very urgent.          &quot;We are building up  an information department of     the Soaraen&apos;s Seotion and  intend, issuing a monthly     Bulletin commencing with  the 1st of October,  if possible.     We would be very glad if  you will forward us the       &apos;..     government reports upon the loss of life at sea.  The     reports ought to show how  the seamen  lose their lives, :&apos;v     whether by accidents such as boiler explosion, bursting     of steam pipes, carrying  away the rigging during storms-/     or by ships&apos; foundering etc., etc   We want reports     on the tonnage laid up and active, the amount of British     and Asiatic seamen employed in British ships, how many     ships, and their tonnage, are burning  oil, eto., etc.&quot;     Tho volume of correspondence from the  variousInterxiational Propaganda Committees on the  Continent to theBritish Bureau is, if anything, increasing;  this weekspecial documents relating to  the engineers, leather workers and clothing workers have been sent to this country.     On August 26th a conference of Left Wing miners in theEhondda district was held:  delegates were present fromMoray,  Peradale, fylorstown, Wattstown, Ynyehir, Porth,Trehafod, Tonyrefail, Mia-Bhondda, Clydaoh Yale, BlainRhondda and Llwynpia.   Master of Tylorstown was in the chairand Tom Thomas of Ynyshir acted as secretary.   The conferenceappears to have been successful from the point of view of the organisers and a resolution was unanimously passed to theeffect  that a &quot;minority movement be now definitely established within the district&quot;.    It was also resolved thaton September 9th a further conference should be held at theWorkmen&apos;1 s akali, Ferndale, in order to afford an opportunityfor sll miners&apos; lodges in the  district to be represented.Arthur  Homer is expected to be present and Nat Watkins has

CONSHBSS          On August 21st the Mid-European Bureau of the  Red     International of Labour Unions sent to the British Bureau     a copy of the following letter from the All Russian Central     Council of Trade Unions to the British Trade Union Congress.1               &quot;The Russian Trade Unions have made repeated          attempts to establish direct relations with the trade          unions of Great Britain.  In 1930 a delegation of          British tiade unions visited soviet Russia;  yet in the          last three years not a single representative of the          Russian unions has been able to gain admission to          England,  Speculators, counted revolutionists, Tsarist          generals, courtiers of all sorts and ranks, have free          access to your country, but not a single Russian worker          ie admitted to British territory.   The entire apparatus          of the British Empire has been set in motion to prevent          the establishment of fraternal.relations between the          workers of these two countries.   Yet now, more than          ever, are close relations between the workers of Russia          and England necessary.   Tha ultimatum of Lord curzon,        !  whose treatment of Russia as another Egypt or Mesopotamia,          undoubtedly points to a softening of his brain, has only          recently been liquidated.   How the enemies of Soviet          Russia in England are again causing trouble in connection          with tha appointment of Comrade gakovsky as Soviet          representative in London.   Within another week, these          mortal enemies of the &quot;Russian Revolution will.invent          something new in order to arouse antagonism between the          toiling masses of England and Russia.   Six years have          passed since the Ootober Revolution;  yet the owners of          the property confiscated by the Soviets cannot reconcile          themselves to the new situation;  they are ready to strew          the entire world with new multitudes of oorpses only in          order to receive back their property, accumulated  by           years of robbery,               &quot;Besides the attempt of  the world bourgeoisie,          including also the boxu-geoisie of your aountry, to          strangle Soviet Russia, there are other sources cf trouble          throughout the world.   Europe is const an. fly on the brink          of a new war.   The sharpening of tha Anglo-French    :          conflict, the unceasing deterioration of Central Europe,          the ceaseless extermination of the Mesopotamian and          Indian population, the American-Japanese conflict, which          is now aggravated by the building of a British naval          base at  Singapore, the feverish  growth of armaments -          all this will undoubtedly lead shortly to another          internal slaughter.  The bourgeoisie is preparing for this           &apos;last&apos; war.  Simultaneously with its economic offensive          upon labour, the bourgeoisie is  also depriving the                                                        working/
     working class of its elementary rights;  this attack of     the extreme reaction is carried on under the banner of     Fascism.  The viotory of Fasoism signifies the     enslavement of the working class and the intensification     of the national imperialist conflicts, and new hitter     wars to complete the mutual destruction.  In the last     two years the reaction has won considerable victories     in many countries.   The insolence of the bourgeoisie is     in direct proportion to the division and passivity of     the international proletariat.         &quot;The Russian trade unions follow with alarm the     victorious force of the capitalist offensive.  We     watch closely and sympathetically the struggle of the     British miners and metal workers, who were defeated     owing to their isolated action against the well united,     perfectly disciplined and organised enemy.  Similar     conditions are noticeable in other countries.  We,  the     Russian proletarians, who are feverishly engaged in the     reconstruction of our eoonomy, we who hold in our     iron dutches the few capitalists who are permitted     to carry on business on our territory, we are     desirous of establishing constant and regular     connections between the trade unions of Russia and of     England.  We do not in the least minimize the     differences between us.  We are members of two     different Internationals.   However, this fact should     not prevent us from establishing the United Front:  on     the contrary, it should strengthen our will for unity:     the United Front of the Russian and British trade     unions would mean the United Front between the     Amsterdam International and the Red International     of Labour Unions.  The deep lying causes which led to     the split of the International trade union movement     oannot be removed by mere words, no matter how good     they sound.  The only means of establishing unity of     the world labour movement is to start a joint straggle     against the capitalist offensive, against the fascist     reaction and the menace of war.  And to the extent     that the workers of various politioal tendencies will     fight shoulder to shoulder against their class     enemies, to the extent that the United Front will be     strengthened in the struggle - to that extent will     the organisational unity of the world trade union     movement be re-established.          &quot;The All-Russian Central Council o  Trade Unions     sends fraternal greetings to the British proletariat,     represented by your congress, and expresses the hope     that Just as the Russian transport workers were     successful in coming to an understanding with the     transport workers of England and other countries,     so will all the other unions of Russia be able to find     a oomraon basis with the unions of Great Britain and     oreate the United Front against our common class     enemies,&quot;     A few communist delegates are attending the Trade falon Congress at Plymouth and it is not uninteresting to note that on August 29th Ellen Wilkinson wrote to one of&quot;the communist organisers;
               &quot;Just off to  the  Trade  Union Congress where pollitt         and  I propose to  awaken the  echoes. - We are having   &quot;         Communist Party meetings  every night and a special         women&apos;s meeting on Wednesday.  Hope wo shall at least         shock that dull Old Congress.&quot;SBIZDHE 0? BOISHEVIK LITERATURE  AT  WEST HARTLBBOOL         The  CMef Constable of Durham informs me that  on    August  25th, Captain N.K. Mukaloff called on the Superintendent    of Police at West Hartlepool and  stated that he was    Superintendent of the Russian  Government Baltic navigation    and was enquiring, on behalf of that bodyf into the    circumstances of the recent seizure of literature from the    S.S. &quot;Eommunist&quot;.  He was anxious to know if any of the    literature had been brought ashore and if so, by whom, as    that person or persons  would be dealt with by his    &quot;authorities&quot;.   Mukaloff added that he  was not a communist,    but there is reason to  doubt the  accuracy of this statement.iHg YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE         Owing, possibly,  to the  &quot;Daily Herald as&quot; announcement    that the  &quot;British Fascist!&quot; intended to organise opposition,    the Young Communist League  meeting in Trafalgar Square on    September 2nd, held to celebrate  the 9th &quot;International Day    of Youth&quot; was well attended:   some 3,500 people were present    end an unusually large  number  of  young men and women were    selling literature end  were otherwise engaged in active    propaganda:   speeches  were made  by Tom Mann, Walker, Bishop,    Moylan, Freeman, Gilbert and Hannington.  Most of the     speeches  followed stereotyped  lines but the following passage    from Tom  Mann&apos;s speech  is not  uninteresting:-               &quot;We are not  going to Parliament and saying &quot;Will         you  of your goodness have mercy upon us?1  We  have        &apos; accepted full responsibility having no confidence in         the  master class,  no confidence in the capitalist         class, no confidence in the  plutocracy.  These young         communists in their homers, in their classes, in their                                                         leagues/
     leagues,  in their societies,  are learning to hate war,     and  as goon as they get rid of  the  class  wars  peace  -     universal peace,  will prevail,  end  I em  saying that     because I admit that in consequence of  economic     pressure  many working class children are  compelled  to     join the  army.  They join tho army  to fight  for their     country   They have no country  to fight.for, hut they     have to fight.for it all the  same.   We  are busily telling     these young people who do go  into, the army to     understand&quot;what the class struggle  is and when the  time     comes that they are called up to participate  in     Industrial struggles, if they are ordered to  turn their     guns against the  working classes, they  mast never do it.     Neither the rifle, nor the aeroplanes nor the  tanks     nor  any other implement of destruction must be used  by     the  working classes against the working classes. I     take all  responsibility for what I  am sayings   I am not     even asking tho Chairman to share it.  I have  said  it     before and been in &quot;Chokes5 for saying  it.   Soldiers     hon*t shoot if you are called, upon  to do  so.   Let the     rifles be used not to enable  you to shoot down your     fellow workers, they are to enable  you to do  the right     thing in the other direction.  These young people are     being taught to be reliant in conjunction with their     older oomrades, to solve first and  foremost  the     economic  problem, the problem of poverty.&quot;     The  following paragraph appeared in the issue  of &quot;TheYoung Worker&quot; for September 1923;                    &quot;For Soldiers  and sailors          &quot;The Young Communist League realises that many     young workers through unemployment  have been  forced  to     join the  navy and the army,, and they wish to point     out  that  Comrade Walton levsbold, M.P.,  is anxious and     Willing to help any soldier or sailor comrade  in his     oapacity as a member of parliament.  Any who  desire     his  help  should write to us.&quot;IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES Ifl GREAT BRIT API         Irish Republicans here  profess to be  delighted  with    the  result of the  General Election,  which,  they  say,  is a    great deal better  than they  either hoped or anticipated:  well    informed  correspondents say  the  effect has been  to give fresh    heart to  the  movement.  Some  of  the  &quot;Helpers&quot;  sent over have    returned,  end ere  boasting of having voted,  although  none    of them had the right  to do  BO:  personation appears  to have    been fairly common.    The  measure  of success obtained by the    Republicans is attributed, b,y well informed Irishmen  here, to                                                           an/
m increased  labour  vote  in their favour.  The Irish workers are,  it  is  said,  sick and tired  of. their present leaders andmany  voted  Republican in  the hope of effecting a change.There is a  growing opinion, based probably on a memorandumissued from Republican Headquarters, that some at least of the elected  Republicans  will  take their seats in An Dail, takingthe oath with reservations;  the question is believed to be under consideration  and may result in a split in Republicanforces.     The Irish Self-Determination League is at last definitelydefunct,  In  a circular just issued by the Emergency Committee,             itBranch Secretaries are advised that it is no longer possibleto carry on and that,  owing to lack of funds, a fullyrepresentative conference cannot be held.  A suggestion is made that  where  possible  branches should form themselves into localRepublican  clubs  prepared,  when  the call comes again, toreunite  and make  themselves strong to help the motherland.The circular  also contains  the following somewhat significantpassage:         &quot;You also,  no doubt, recognise that the national     fight  has entered another phase that has to be fought     out in Ireland.&quot;It is proposed to issue a final  financial statement at a later date; at the  moment  assets do not cover liabilities.     The peckham  Branch,  one of  the most active*in London, hasalready  turned itself into  a Sinn Fein club &quot;to be run on constitutional lines&quot;, but  most  of the other London branches havtclosed down.     The new  &quot;Irish  Republican League of Great Britain&quot; ishanging  fire  and  is  looking for  a Hall to hold meetings in:there were  no meetings in Hyde Park this week end.                                               T.P. CConnor^s/
     T.P.  OrConnorf j Irish Democratic League is starting a propaganda campaign in London and other large Irish centres inGreat Britain:   Mr.  John Brady is the chief organiser.     In Liverpool lively times are expected at the next city council election,!, , Pour Irish councillors are coming out inNovember and  they are to be fought by the labour Party.  feeling is running high and  local Irishmen claim that they are be ingtreated with  the vilest ingratitude seeing that the Labourparty owes its  very  existence to the Irish vote.     In Glasgow there was great rejoicing in the Sinn FeinClubs over the  result of the elections,  which is described as a great victory for the Republican cause:   a leadingRepublican said that 20 seats were all they expected:  here,also, there is  a division of opinion on the question ofRepublicans entering the Bail, many holding that an oathtaken under duress need not be regarded as binding.     &apos;The Irish  Republican Army is still reoruiting andreorganising,,
