INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOL FOR THE. RECOGNITION, - ..oTTSEHJmT5I^^Note by the Lord Chancellor.          The Memorandum of the President :0f&apos;the Board of trade on the above subject ;(C.?&apos;.&apos;345(23))  was circulated just beforemy illness commenced and I had no opportunity at that time of putting my views on the matter before the Cabinet.   It ratsindeed mentioned in the Memorandum that the Attorney-General,Mr. Mackinnon K.C., and I, had called attention to &quot;certain points of possible difficulty&quot; arising out of the Protocol andparticularly out of Clause 4;  but these points were not furtherspecified.          The Cabinet on the 1st August (of course in my absence)resolved:-          That (unless a favourable opportunity should          unexpectedly present itself for securing an          amendment ef Article 4 without re-opening any          other questions) the British Delegate at the          Assembly of the League of Nations should be          authorised to accept the Protocol and sign          it a3 it stands, reserving the position of the          Colonies, Overseas Possessions, or Protectorates,          as provided for in&quot;&quot; Article 8.          Being now convalescent,  and understanding that a furthermeting of the Cabinet will be held before effect is given to the                                -1-
above  resolution,  I  think it my duty to bring the. legal objectionsto the Protocol  in its  present form to the notice of the Cabinet.The Attorneys-General has  been good enough to formulate theprincipal objections in a Note of which a copy is annexed;  andI understand from  him that in his opinion the Protocol^ if accepted,is &quot;likely to cause much trouble to our traders in future years,1 agree with his view,  and I think that,  rather than accept animperfect agreement,  it would be wise to postpone acceptance fora few  months,  or (if need be) until next year, with a view to securing the amendments which are plainly required.                    : .                                 f!!f      I                                    (Intld)  C.House of Lords, S.W.    30th August, 1923.
Hots by-the Attorney-General referred to in the     foregoing Note by the Lord Chancellor.         The object of the Protocol is to ensure thatarbitration agreements shall be recognised as valid in allcountries v/hich assent to its provisions end accordinglyclause 1 affirms the validity of such agreements.   This isnecessary since some countries, of which Prance is an example,only recognise the validity of agreements to submit an existingdifference to specified arbitrators, and ignore agreements to submit future differences to arbitration.   But the clauseroserves to each country the right to limit suoh recognition&quot;to contracts which are recognised as commercial by its ownlegislation&quot;.   This seems to me to constitute a dangerouspitfall, since a British subject would have to ascertain,with regard to any foreign country, first whether it hasexercised the right, and secondly, if so, whether his particularcontract was one which was recognised, as commercial by thelegislation of that country.    In practice, the British subject would probably enter into the contract in reliance on the arbitration clause, snd only discover when he attempted toenforce it that this requirement rendered the arbitrationclause ineffective.   Clause 2 provides that the arbitralprocedure is to be governed by the lav.&apos; of the country in whichthe arbitration takes- place.  This is probably f. necessary provision in&apos;any such international agreement, but itobviously may give rise to considerable difficulty in thecase of a foreign country with whose procedure the british subject is probably not familiar.Clause 3 provides that awards made in its own territory underthe preceding clauses shall be enforced by each country inaccordance with the provisions of its national laws.   It                            l.       .....  .           &apos;
 designedly ,gives no effect  to awards  made  in the  terrjftecy ef another oountry,  so  that for  an example an award made in England in pursuance of an  Anglo-Frohch contract  is given no effect in France against the  French contractors. Further,  the offoot given&apos;to arbitral awards  varies in different countries.  In England,  they may by leave of the Court  be  enforced by execution or  otherwise in the same way as judgments.   In other countries they may only be enforceable  by  action,  so that a British sxibject who has obtained  an  award in a  foreign country may. find himself exposed to very great difficulties, and  delays when he attempts  to  enforce  it  thoro.  Clause  4  is. in my opinion. the olau.se most likely  to give rise to difficulty.  It obliges tribunals of any oountry adopting the Protoool to refer  the parties to the decision  cf the arbitrators whenever  they recognise the existence  of: an arbitration agreement which is valid and capable of being put  into faroe.   In.the first place there is at least considerable dtubt. as  to the oonstruotion whioh the courts of  some oountries will  r-ut. on the wcrds &quot;valid and  oapable of being put into-foroe&quot;, having regard to the widely differing views of the legal system of different countries as to what arbitration agreements are valid and oapable of enforcement, and there is also considerable doubt  whether the courts of some countries will &quot;recognise the existence&quot; of an arbitration clause, whioh according to the domestic laws of that - country is  invalid and&apos; incapable cf enforcement Secondly there is no provision for the tribunal to retain any control over the course  where a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement is bound to axist.  Consequently itmight quite easily happen that the tribunal, would  be compelled  to refer the parties to the  arbitration,  and that
 one party might then indefinitely delay or  even altogetherprevent $he progress of the arbitration with the resultthat the injured party would be deprived of redressaltogether.  Under existing English law the Court merelystays en action in cases where there is an arbitrationclause, so that if any difficulty arises the jurisdiction of the Court can still be invoked,   In view, of theforegoing considerations it is plain that  this Protocolmight often result in the British contractor who relied upon an arbitration clause finding it altogether ineffective;it might often involve expense and  delay far exceeding thatinvolved in fin ordinary lawsuit,  and  in some oases it might even result in the British Contractor being wholly deprived of all redress.
