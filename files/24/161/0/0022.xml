prtimmriBTS IH SESSION  AT MOSCOW         The  Enlarged Executive of the  Communist  Internal;ional    in Moscow devoted the 4th ana 5th days  of  the  Session  (June 15th    and 16th) to  &quot;(She world Political Situation&quot;  (item  3 on  the    agenda quoted  in  last week!s report).   Radek,  who was  the    chief speaker, reviewed the situation from the Russian communist    standpoint.    According to a special number of the   &quot;International  press Correspondence&quot;, Radek in the course of his    speech,  which  contained many bitter allusions to Britain&apos;a    foreign policy, said:              &quot;The revolutionary movement in the  Orient is in         danger...We have only just  recently heard the  news         that in  Teheran the National semi-Democratic Government         has been  overthrown and replaced by Anglophile elements.         In Turkey also the elements who are anxious for an         agreement with the Entente  are also the  bitterest foes of         Communism.   The attention of our English Party must be         directed  to  this question.&quot;         Aooording to the same issue of the &quot;International Press    Correspondence&quot; T.A. Jackson of  1iie Communist Party of Great    Britain said  that:              &quot;He  clearly recognised the importance of  Radek&apos;s&apos;         exposition of the significance of  British Imperialism in         India and the East in the present  world  situation.  The         total effect of recent developments was  to make the         Empire a matter of life and death  for Great Britain both         for economic and military reasons.              &quot;The British Party recognised that  its responsibilities         were great.  Its duty was to take  advantage of and  to         support  every national struggle against  the domination         and exploitation of the British imperial system.         Especially must it develop  every tendenoy to class-         conscious expression on the part of the  workers and         peasants within these movements.              &quot;But the extraordinary difficulty of the  problem         must be  stressed.  No one could know  this who  had not         studied  the  great complexity and haphazard illogloeHty of         the structure of the empire.i.              &quot;Although recognising  its obligations, the British         Party was very small, and faeefl with  sn  ol4f e^erphosd         and winning  bourgeoisie,  A beginning had been foadSi   Ihi         Oriental  Seemen&apos;3 Union had been formed  to link together         the sailors  and port-workers of all the  Oriental  Colonies,                                                        Contact/
     Contact had &quot;been  made with  the  Indian  students in     England,   wherever  It was possible in  the press or by     propaganda to educate the British worker as  to the true     situation, this was done.   But  the extraordinary     ignorance  of the  British worker, and hi3 indifference  to     the empire must be  remembered.   It was, curiously enough,     owing  to this ignorance that  lord  Curzon failed recently     to arouse  enthusiasm for an attack upon Soviet Russia,     on the plea that  the empire was in danger,   There was,     however, the section in the British  labour Party, who,     because they hoped  one day  to take power, were concerned     about  the  danger  to the empire.  But the masses of the     workers were indifferent.         &quot;The  British Delegation  was conscious of  its     inexperience and  would welcome  the advice of the more     experienced members of the  Congress.&quot;     The following extracts from a letter written in Moscowby Robert Stewart on June 18th,  illustrate  the dissensionamong members of the Executive Committee  of the CommunistParty of Great  Britain:        - &quot;MacManus is back and  the  British conference is     now going  on in a kind of way.  Bell has not come as  I     suppose he is too busy at home.   MacManus being back,     there  will be no  occasion to  leave anyone else here so     I expect now to be  back about the end  cf June-..   The     British Conference  is not any more likely than the     previous ones to  solve our  difficulties.  The  kind of     attitude that Dutt  takes now  is that he and  Pollitt     should be  allowed to pick a Central  Committee  as the     others of  us are  not fit for  the work  or the central     leadership of the Party which is very  nice to  know.  So I     think  we may take it that there may  be a few rows     before we  leave.  Obviously if  an opinion like that     holds  a place in  the Executive Committee it will be     next to impossible  to get anything done.   I am     therefore  likely  to be back home for good and  hope this     time to find a job  somewhere  or another,         &quot;When one seas the work  and character of  the men     here and then takes part in our pitiful squabbles it     almost breaks one&apos;s heart.  However  we may get to some     kind of agreement here although at the moment  I very     much doubt it...&quot;     Stewart&apos;e  expectation of &quot;rows&quot; seems  to have  been realised when the conference regarding the  position of the CoBimunist Party of Great Britain was officially opened in Moscow on June  25th,   His faction bitterly attacked Palme Dutfg policy and the  Comintern  delegates to the  Conference folded that the British delegates should remain  in Moscowuntil/
3 *17iuntil they were unanimous on the policy to he pursued by their part.   It is interesting to note that one of therepresentatives of the Comintern at this Conference wasMichael Borodin, the Soviet agent who was sentenced to sixmonths&quot; imprisonment in Glasgow in August, 1928, and.deportedfrom this oountry to Russia.in February of, thiB year..     On July 5th J.T. Walton Newbolfi, M.P., returned to thisoountry from Moscow.     It is reported that the Committee of Action at Moscow .has appointed Pollitt, Murphy, Jaokson and. Inkpin as membersof the &quot;Commission for Combatting Fascism and MilitaryBffioienoy in Foreign countries.&quot;                    - f* -IRISH BXTOIISIS AND COMMUNISTS         The Irish Communist Party appear to be anxious about the    non-receipt of money allocated to them:   on July 4th the    treasurer of the Irish Communist Party wrote&apos;-as follows to    the organising secretary of the Communist Party of Great    Britain:              &quot;We have  again got word that money was Bent for         us on April 19th,  whioh, confirms the&apos; previous word .sent.         As you know,  I was in London a few weeks ago when   -    ,         nothing was known of it,  so I was told.  Kindly         inquire and let us know by return to the  address I         gave you when over.&quot;&apos;         With reference to the Information published in last    week&apos;s report regarding rumours of a secret understanding    between Irish extremists and communists it is  not without    interest to note that at an Irish meeting held in Dundee on .    June 29th Madame Markiewicz said that they must remember that    they were now &quot;backed up by the Communist party&quot;.         It is reported that the Executive of the  Communist    Party intend shortly to hold- a secret meeting  with a view to    arranging for more  aotlve co-operation with the Irish                                                      Republicana/
MMMTOISttS AMP THE S0CBR3&apos; STRIKE         During the week communists, organised unemployed,    members of the Bed International of labour unions and of the    Industrial Workers of the World have been active In London    and the Provinces in connection with the dockers&apos; strike.    Communist Instructions have been sent to District Party    Committees and the Strike Bulletins, issued ostensibly by    the London Unofficial strike committee, are in reality the    work of the CommuniBt Party.   Practically all speeches    made by communists during this period have been devoted,in    the main^o this dispute.   Fortunately, however,    comparatively little attention has been paid,by the    majority of the dockers to the speeches of these agitators,    The strikers deny that the strike is a &quot;Red&quot; one and  the    following reasons are given for their action:         (a)  The general impression that the cost of living              ha3 not decreased sufficiently to justify              the reduction in their wages.         (b)  the fact that they were not officially              notified by their Union that the reduotion              was to be made.         On July 5th Ernest Cant,  organiser of the London    District Party Committee of the Communist party wrote to    the communist W.  Sturrock,  who is secretary of the  London    Unofficial Strike Committee:              &quot;Dear Comrade,                   &quot;Herewith half a dozen of a bulletin              whioh I got prepared this evening,   I em              having it sent to our people  in the  various              ports with instructions to get it in to the              hands of the  leaders of the strike movement.                   &quot;I saw some of the S.B.  fellows,  but not              party members.  They are not  very lively and              you will need to pull them into definite  lines...&quot;         The bulletin mentioned reads as follows:*                                                     &quot;TRANSPORT/

BULLETIN No. li  July 5th, 23.!Ehe Position.     &quot;Having seen the news that on Monday the Lock Workers inHull had refused to accept the proposed reductions and had refused to work, the London workers on Tuesday, without anyagitation, followed suite.   There were no leaders oragitation.  It was a spontaneous revolt against the attemptto lower what is already a starvation existence.     &quot;Since then events have moved rapidly and. a Btrikecommittee has been established in East London and one InS.Bo London.  Efforts are being made to get these together to form a central committee.     &quot;The East London Strike Committee was elected atMass Meetings of the men, and at thalr first meeting thiscommittee took whatever steps it could to get into touchwith the sections on strike in the provinces.  Being an unofficial move the ordinary union machinery is notavailable, and no names of secretaries of strike committees were available.  Telegrams were, however, sent to Hull,Bristol and Cardiff.     &quot;Replies have been received from Cardiff and Bristolreporting that the movement there is strong and the menuni te d.   fur the r rep or ts ar e from ES d.     &quot;Will the secretaries of all strike oomnittees not yet in touch kindly communicate with the above in order that co-Ojfl&amp;nation may be arrived at,     &quot;This Bulletin will be sent out regularly in orderthat complete contact may be maintained,   ?fe regret that eventhe ^Daily Heraia1 is not too reliable on this issue because.seit is the official paper.   Vie are considering thepossibility of printing a regular bulletin.   If othercommittees can give any assistance (a) by sending in fi%Hreports (b) financial,  it will be welcomed,     &quot;If you send reports it is imperative that they should beaccurate.  To mislead us would endanger all  our work.     &quot;In London there  are at present 20,000  men out at the victoria, Albert, King Bdward and Surrey Commercial Doeks*The Committee is applying itself to  the task of bringingothers into line.  The  clerical and  administrative staffsare with us wherever our men are out.                                                     &quot;OUR/

                                                        ISO     (1)   First  of all make clear  that  despite  the          anomalies concerning the agreement  and  the Union,          we  should not  encourage  any suggestion  of a break          from the union.

In extreme  oases  of hardship,     the slogan should be  *Go to  the Guardians&apos;.          &quot;These guiding lines should help  you  in the event     of  any developments talcing place in your area,&quot;     As  in the case of Bulletin No. 1,  Bulletin No. 2,  whichis dated  July 6th, is signed by W. Sturrock and contains thefollowing  pas sages :-           w          &quot;Tho position  in London  to-day is stronger than ever.     The stoppage  of work  Is almost complete, docks, wharves     and warehouses all  being involved.          &quot;Only two wharves remain with their normal staffs     and these are being especially approached.   To-night the     regular  staff employees of the Port of London Authority     will  cease  work, after drawing their current week&apos;s     pay.              &quot;So  far as reports from the provinces are     concerned ^e  have not yet been  hie to establish perfect     contact, and  we rely  upon the press for  our  information.     But we are  pleased  to note that Manchester and other     places are  falling  into line  with  us.     The Official  Attitude     &quot;The national Locks Group Committee met yesterdayand passed a resolution Instructing us to return to workon Monday.  This resolution was officially conveyed tothe East London Strikers at a meeting held last night in Canning Town.  As evidence of the determined spiritof the men their resolution was unanimously rejected anda resolution passed pledging all concerned to a tay outuntil our ends are achieved.  Since the officialpronouncement was made its effect has been seen, not in &amp;return to work, but in increasing numbers addingthemselves to our forces,   we have reason to believe that many of the lesser officials are in sympathy with us.Our Attitude     &quot;This strike is not an anti-offioial strike.   Noris it a strike against the tfaion.   We want the officials and the Union with us.  They are our offioials and theresources of the Union are ours.  We only oall upon them                                                   to/
     to  use  our machinery for our interests.     Our Programme  and  Policy          &quot;With the growth and development of the strike     we  see  no  reason to modify the  programme infliich we outlined     yesterday...     Setting help  of other workers          &quot;Many trade union branches and trades councils in     London  axe passing resolutions  calling upon the Transport     and General&apos; Workers&apos; Union to recognise the strike, also     calling upon  the General Council of the Trade Union     Congress to take the matter up  and convene a National     all in  Workers&apos;  Convention, so  that our question and the     question of all other workers may be considered and     United  Working Class Action taken.     The Government and Agreements^          &quot;They complain that we will not honor agreements.     Remember what  the  Government did to the Miners.  The     Government had undertaken to retain control of the mines     till 1922,  but they decontrolled them in 1921.  This was     a definite signal  to the employers to attack the miners     and initiated  an attack all along the line with the     consequence that the Miners are in the awful state they     are to-day.  If we break agreements which are unfair to     us  it is because we want to re-establish ourselves in     something  like a decent human condition...          &quot;Remember - There must be  no resumption of work     until our  demands  are conceded.&quot;     tte Unofficial Strike Committee published on July 10th .No.l of  a paper entitled &quot;The Docker&quot;, price  a:  theinformation  contained therein is similar to that in theBulletins quoted above:  in addition, reports regarding thesituation in Avcnmouth, Manchester,  Cardiff and Grimsby areincluded and appeals are made to Road Transport Workers,Railwayman,  London  &quot;busmen and Tramway workers to support the dockers, the London &quot;busmen and Tramway workers being asked tohold  a &quot;One  Day sympathetic Strike&quot;.

Little attention is said to                     have been paid to  his remarks.                     On July 5th at a meeting in Southwark,                     attended by about 200 persons, the  same                     speaker, v&amp;ose remarks seemed to meet                                                   with/
              with the approval of only a few of the              audience, stated that:                   &quot;Bo unemployed man will scab in this              strike.  If any unemployed man goes into              these docks to work&apos;, he will go for a swim.              We will commit murder:  we are prepared              to go so far and commit  murder if necessary              before we will allow anybody to scab.&quot;              (Copies of the reports regarding Scales&apos;              speeohes were submitted to the Director of              Public Prosecutions who stated that, although              Scales&apos; speech on July 5th was &quot;a very              improper one and possibly was Intended to              stir up strife during the present Dockers&apos;              strike,&quot; it would not be expedient to              institute proceedings in view of its poor              reception and the fact that, generally              speaking,there had been no disorder in              connection with the dockers dispute.)McCormack     Stated on July 8th at a meeting held in              Trafalgar Square, under the auspices of the              North Southwark branch of the National              Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement where              the audience- decreased from 500 to 60:                   &quot;I am going to appeal to all the dockers              to stand solid to-morrow morning;  refuse to.              go back to work and I can promise you that              inside of another 48 hours instead of having              60,000 on strike in London, you will have              160,000.  The game is yours.   Tou have it in :              your own hands to-day;  never mind about              throwing down or turning over agreements.              Has your Government aver stood by agreements?              ...Our business, that of the unemployed, is              to teach you fallows on strike how to get your              grub when you are out.  That is our job and              our way of getting- food for those who are on              strike is by saying to tham  all *B.aok to the              Guardians.&apos; It*s no good going to the Guardians              in ones and twos;  you want to go to them in              hundreds felling them you demand the scale              of relief that is given to the unemployed and              see you get it.   The unemployed will be&apos;              behind you...&quot;J. Burns&apos;      At the same meeting said:                   &quot;I realise  that the dockers&apos; strike is a              phase of the class struggle and it is a phase              of the class struggle that I am going to              deal with...   We have got to understand that              we shall always have these struggles nofc only              on the wages question, not only on the              struggles for the dockers, on hours, but we              shall have struggles for bread and butter,              become more acute and intensified while w&amp;              maintain this robbing system under \&amp;which we r              live.  When we lock away back in theT  .              trade Union Movement we find that in nov              instance when there la a strike on has a
                Trade Union  official  dared  to  take  the                offensive, unless  it  was  on the pinching  of                the rank and  file  themselves.  Mr.  Bevin  is                one of many:  Mr.  Harry Gosling, Mr.  Jimmy                Thomas, all  these  individuals  are playing                the game... I have  long since realised that                these Trade  Union  officials are  the                lower dogs of the  boss class.&quot;Walter Southwell at the same  meeting stated:-.                     &quot;The Unemployed  Oroanisation has taken                a stand with  the dockers  in their fight  for                the right to  live  in  this country.  How frj^eadei                what has all  the trouble  arisen  about?   The                trouble has  arisen because  the Dockers have                more  &quot;guts1  than the  National  Union of                Railwayman has.    The Dockers  have  kicked                out Bevin and Gosling and if the Railwayman                would do the  same  thingwith Thomas, it would                be all the better  for them. Thank  Christ                the dockers  are out for a fight...  Bevin                and Gosling  have said if  we don&apos;t honour                the agreement and  return  to work we shall                get no strike pay. I ask the  workers of                England, who  are the  Trade  Unionists  - Is it                Bloody Bevin or is it you,  the workers?                have y u no  voice  in  saying what shall be done                with the money you have paid into your                Unions.  I say here and now, the dockers  have                the right to  demand that  the money  they have                paid into their union shall be paid out to                them now as  strike pay.   Honour  agreements.                We will honour an  agreement -  we will sign an                agreement that the bosses will never  forget                the whole of their lives, we will sign an                (agreement for the  orarthrow of the  Capitalist                system and the substitution of the  Dictatorship  &apos;                af the Proletariat...                     &quot;I say  that every Borough where  the                dockers are  in force  must organise  with the                National Unemployed Movement,  and we  will                see that the  Guardians pay  you and  keep you                ifhilst you are in  dispute and  when  the                dispute is settled, the Poor Law authorities                can claim the money they  have  expended in                relief from  the Dockers&apos;  Union.  That will be                one way of getting your money  out of  Sir                Ernest Bevin  end Company.  Dockers, Btand                with your backs to the wall, for Christ&apos;s                sake.  We are told that we  are boys ofvthe                Bull dog breed.  If that  is so,  let us once                and for all  stop this retreat  we have                experienced  for the last  two years, the                retreat of every class of worker.   Since  the                downfall of  the miners we have gone to the                wall, wages  reductions, unemployment  and                tyranny.  Now once and for  all,  all sections                of the workers must get back,  must  get                united - we must have a united front.                     &quot;We are  being driven towards an  industrial                upheaval.  We are  being driven towards the                                                       great/
                great day when the workers of England and of                the world will he called upon to  stake all on                the overthrow of Capitalism.  What has                Capitalism benefited ma or you?   I and you                have been slaves from the day of  our births                and we will be slaves until the day we are put                in the grave, unless we wake up...   I think                it is time the workers organised  and overthrew                the damnable system and establish in it*                plaoe a socialist Commonwealth.   Poverty and                misery is my lot.  Their lot is ease and                luxury.  I oommend the words of Marr - He does                not eat that will not work...&quot;    I say the                workers in Dockland, la the National,union of                Railv/railwaymen, in the Police, must Btand in with                the National Unemployed Workers&apos;  Committee                Movement, which is the only organisation that                has fought on behalf of the workers in any                dispute that has occurred since black Friday.                I appeal to you in conclusion, you Dockers, if                you are asked to go back to work  to-morrow,                don&apos;t go back.  I will promise you this.that in                our particular area, we will find ways and means                of keeping you and getting you food until you                are granted the right to live.  Why starve,  I                cannot see for the life of ma when the boss class                kicks you out, that you must sell your ohattela                and go into the workhouse, or lie in the gutter  -                or sleep in the great places.  I  have realised                that the fight is on,  I hope the members of the                National Union of Railwayman and  the Transport                Workers will come out and support the Dockers...&quot;Harry Pollitt    At a meeting in Canning Town on July 8th, at                which the audience numbered 500,  said that:                          &apos;TOie struggle whioh the Dockers have                Just entered into is no ordinary  affair.  It is                a strike for bread ana very little of that, for                what can a man with a family do with the                pittance that is usually earned by the Dook                labourer?  If they were all communists they                would strike for much more than they now are                doing, but, unfortunately, it will be many years                before the revolution in this country.,.The                Dockers should ignore their leaders&apos; advice about                returning to work...&quot;                     Pollitt also Baid that the dockers should,                an no account  leave their Union  but keep in it                and work in it.giaft            Addressing an open air communist  meeting held                on July 8th at Osborne street at  whioh $bout                 100 persons were present,said that:                     &quot;The revolt of the Dock ana  Riverside &apos;                Workers throughout the country was a sign ibfcat                the  Communist Movement had taken  root among N^e                working classes.  The Communist party has no,                faith in arbitration, as this is  the method by                which Thomas, Bevin, Gosling and  other traitorsin/
               in the Labour Party, malts  use of to bring               down working men  to  the  level of slaves.    The               Communist Party ought  to have complete               control of the Labour  machine,  and  then the             ,  workingmen would  suffer  no reduction in wages,               hours or conditions  of employment...&quot;g,  lawrenoe     Addressing the seme  meeting stated  that the&quot;**              Communist Party would  render financial  aid               to the dockers now on  strike.     The communist, Fred Taylor, who is a member  of the Information Department of the All Russian Co-operative, Society, is reported to be collecting money on behalf  of  the men on strike:  on July 6th the sum collected was said toI1 amount to  4.10.0.1     The Chief Constable of Liverpool informs roe  that  J.3J. Walton Hewbold, M.P., addressed a meeting of the  LiverpoolIgroup of the Communist Party on July Sth:  the audienoej lumbered about 500.&apos;   Eeferring to the dockers&apos; strike he said          He had often heard that figures could not lie, but     he knew for a fact that the Board of Trade could  lie     with figures, and had done so in regard to the cost     of living.  He continued by saying that the  employing     class gave the dockers their sixteen shillings per day,     end make sure that it was well advertised, but they did     not say that the men only worked about three days per     week...rat vl          &apos;            i                        .          He advised the dockers present not to handle any     oargo from ships which had been diverted to  the port of     Liverpool and not to coma out on strike on acoount of     the reduction, but in sympathy with their fellow workers     in London, Hull, Bristol and other places, and at the     same time he requested carters and railway workers not to     handle any black-leg goods;  then the whole  of the docksH   and transport would be at a standstill.     The Chief Constable of Birkenhead informs me that on the HI Jternoon of July 8th the same speaker addressed  a meeting llsld under the auspices of the local group of the communist H Hpty;  the audience, which numbered about 400, was not very ffl^husiaatlo.  In the course of his speech hewart /boia said:Wt        9hat he had come there on behalf of the Communistmm   Party, not to advise the dockers to strike, because14   that would be giving the other fellows the chance they 1 1   were looking for.  &quot;What I advise the dockers to do 1B j;j  thia:- S                                                  &quot;The/
-1* -  .                      187     &quot;She summer has now arrived and you certainlyshould take advantage of the fine weather.  The shipowners have beep having a week-end at Henley and other places.  You certainly deserve a holiday BO why not takea walk towards EOylake and West Kirby and leave the docksto take care of themselves.     &quot;At present your labour is cheap because there le noscarcity but if you go out in the oountry, that causes ascarcity and labour becomes valuable, and then the shipowners to get their profits will soon h3 sending all themessenger boys they can find to come and bring you back.     &quot;The leaders of the Union are in this position - in1919 ana 19EO they were invited to conferences fendenquiries regarding the cost of living and production.At that time the Transport Workers and Miners had theCapitalist class by the throat and they knew they were beatunless they could hoax the workers.  They invited theleadsrB to the House of lords and allowed them the use -ofthe Robing Room.  They fooled them to the top of their   &apos;.-bent and then said 1 This is certainly a Just demand, wemust give the men what they ask for1, but as usual theyallowed things to drift and instead of the men gettingwhat they were supposed to get they kidded the leadersinto signing agreements which they dare not go baok onnow.  If you only knew that you oould trust your leadersit would not be so bad, but they are compelled to denyyou in public and order you back to work, whilst in myopinion some of them are absolutely in sympathy with you and if you stick out, will certainly use all theirendeavours on your behalf.  They dare not voice their  4feelings because immediately they did so, the other fellow,the Capitalist, would immediately take legal action endpinch what few funds you&apos;ve got left in your unions.  If the dockers stlok out in their unofficial strike, they cannot?;touch anyone, because the leaders do not advise, and i hope that you will be firm and not be gulled by theCapitalist press, that men are going in here and there,and go baok yourselves, thus giving the other side a lever-to beat the other unions they iatend to tackle, if theycan bring this off successfully.  I am not going to adviseyou to strike, as I said before, but I certainly tell youyou deserve a holiday, Just as much as the boss.  So they:cannot Bay that the communist advised you to strike, although they are only too anxious to state that we want to stir up all the trouble we can.  I say that what we wantis revolution, whioh ia only evolution going fast, and snvevolution is revolution going slow.&quot;     A* question time a member  of the  audience asked  lewbold  ifthe agreement  should not be kept as a  point  of honour.Hewbold replied:  &quot;Point of honour be  damned, if the  men  arebullied into making the agreement they should break it.&quot;Another question asked was:   &quot;Are the  ocmmunists prepared tobold office?&quot;  to which Hewbold  replied,  &quot;Yes, from                                            Buckingham/

Dragsund denied knowledge of the content i     of the parcel and stated that as no one had turned up to     take the parcel from him in London and as he did not know     the name and address of the man who v/as to have met the     ship he intended to throw the parcel overboard.

(By English translators)     (2)  The English translation will he dispatched          to you immediately on publication of the   &apos;       German issue, and you will have to print          it in England.  Of course you will have          opportunity to revise and alter          particulars of the text as you think fit.     &quot;The English text of the latest Miners&apos;,Metalworkers&apos; and Transport workers -Bulletins is in preparation now.     &quot;Please make all preparations for printing and publication of the Bulletins at an early date, andalso take up communications at once with the Party aswell as with our militant comrades in the tradeunions in order to organize the broadest possiblecirculation.     &quot;All immediate expenses ought to be defrayed bythe funds of the Bureau and - if these should not besufficient - by a loan from the party.     As soon as we have from you sn estimate of&apos; the costs of printing for the three above-mentionedBulletins, the sum required will be sent.     We hope to hear from you at the earliestpossible date your opinion on this matter and further proposals as to the number of edition, etc.     &quot;The edition of the Bulletins here is no\K?f2,000 copies each.     &quot;Until now the circulation of our Literature  &quot;vin England is&apos; sadly lagging behind that of even &quot;the smallest and most backward countries.     &quot;In view of the decisive importance of theEnglish movement, this cannot continue any longer.     &quot;We hope that by having the translations madehere, we shall remove part of the difficulties and help towards an improved state of affairs in thefuture.&quot;UNEMPLOYED      Sections  of  the  unemployed  in  the East End of London have  broken away  from the  National  Unemployed Workers&apos;                                              Committee/

The reasons for their&apos;a session and their programme axe given in a manifestoissued by them and quoted below:            &quot;&quot;MANIFESTO  Off  THE  UNEMPLOYED               A Revolt Against  utility&quot;Fellow Workers,     &quot;The ahove is the name of a new organisationwhioh is not in any way connected with anotherorganisation known as the National Unemployed workers&quot;Committee Movement.  On the contrary, this organisation is the outcome of the inability of theN.U.W.C.M.. as at present constituted to accomplishanything approaching a better standard of livingfor the workers, whether employed or unemployed.                    Uhree Years Wasted.     &quot;We contend that the reason the N.U.W.CM.after three years&apos; attempt at organisation, hasnot aocomplfshed anything, is because it has beendominated by professional politicians, many of whom have never been workers, and consequently know nothing of the working-class movement.  This makes themovement a oatspaw of political parties and has theeffect of dividing the workers against themselvesinstead of uniting against the forces of Capitalism.                      A Better Polioy     &quot;Therefore  the principles on whioh theunemployed workers organise will be built as. follows:          &quot;The working class and the employing class     have nothing in common;  there can be no peaoe     as long as hunger and want are found amongst     the millions of the working people whilst ijhe     few who make up the employing olass have al$L     the good things of life.          &quot;Between these two classes a struggle mUst   .  go on until the workers of the world orgsiiisV as     a class, take possession of the earth and machinery     of production, and abolish the wage system.Not Work or Maintenance, but Abolition of Wagedom.          &quot;Instead of the Conservative motto of the     N.U.W.CM. &quot;work at Trade Union rates or     maintenance at&apos;Trade Union rates,&quot; we must     inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword:     &quot;Abolition of the wage System.&apos;          &quot;It is the historic mission of the working                                              oUass//
         olesa  to do away with capitalism.  The  army of         proStiotioa must he  organised not only for the         everyday struggle with  Capitalism, hut  also to         oarry  on production when  Capitalism shall have been         overthrown.  By organising industrially we are         forming the structure of  the new society within         the  shell  of the old.                              Direct Aotion.         &quot;Realising that poverty caused by unemployment     cannot be permanently abolished by palliative methods,     we advocate the intensification of the claBS struggle by     the application of direct action whenever necessary and     whenever possible.                    No Affiliation  to labour Party         &quot;We  are opposed to  affiliation to a counter-     revolutionary party as the labour Party or such a     reformist party as the Communist Party of Great Britain.         &quot;We likewise oppose  affiliation to such reactionary     organisation as the Trade Union Congress, and reject the     R.I.I.U.  because it admits Trade Unions to-affiliate,         &quot;We firmly believe  In the application of a rigid     dictatorship of the proletariat when the collapse of     Capitalism  arrives, but  until  that time does arrive we     strongly  object to the dictatorship of a small caucus     of self-seeking politicians  who make the :united Front&apos;     an excuse for their own  self-aggrandisement.                           No Reformism.         &quot;We  fully  erpeot to  be  charged with trying to split     the movement -  that is a stock cry of the politicians - &apos;     but that will leave us-quite cold.  Who has  split the     movement more than these  pseudo revolutionaries?  They     have made discipline a fetish  instead of trying to     understand  what it means,  In  effect, they say:  &apos;;Unless     you agree with  all our reformist ideas,&apos; unless you.     submit to our dictatorship,  you cannot remain in our     movement.5  forgetting that the workers&apos; psychology does     not permit  of mental slavery,         &quot;On behalf of the Joint Committee,                           Alfred  J.
