[This Document is the Property of-His Britannic Majesty&apos;s &quot;Government.Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1923.!&quot;    SECRET.CP. 310 (23).                                 CABINET.THE  SEPARATE  EXISTENCE  OF  THE  ROYAL  AIR  FORCE  AND  THE    AIR MINISTRY SCHEME OF  EXPANSION FOR  HOME DEFENCE.              MEMORANDUM BY THE SECEETABY OE STATE FOE ATE.    I -HEREWITH circulate to my colleagues a memorandum by the Air Staff uponthe two General Staff papers (CP. 294 (23) and 296 (23)) recently placed before  theCabinet by the Secretary of State for War.    The General Staff papers form part of the War Office case that was placed beforethe Committee on National Defence.  The members of the Committee, with the singleexception  of  the Secretary  of State  for War, decided against  the  General Staffrecommendations in favour of breaking up the Air Service.    The  members  of  the  Cabinet  will  remember  that a  controversy over  theorganisation of the Air Service has raged for  several years and  has  accumulated aprodigious mass of memoranda and oral evidence.   If the Cabinet wishes once again to investigate this mass  of controversial material, I am of course prepared  to take upcharge by charge and detail by detail the case presented by the General Staff.  Until,however, I know the wishes of  the Cabinet in this  respect I have assumed that  mycolleagues will not desire to reopen  a detailed investigation of  the work  that  hasoccupied for many months the time of  the Committee on National Defence.  I have accordingly contented myself with the circulation of the Air Staff paper.    To the conclusions that are contained in it I will only add one, a conclusion thatwill, I  think, be admitted by anyone who has been in close contact with the RoyalAir Force.    If the Air Force is broken up and&apos; Air Power is definitely regarded as a subsidiaryweapon of the two  older Services, the enthusiasm of British  Air personnel will bechoked and the development  of British Air Power  crippled at the very moment whenthe air menace is acute and the need for Air Force expansion urgent.                                                             S. H.,                                                    Secretary of State for Air.                    COMMENTS BY THE AIE STAEF ON CABINET PAF-EES.                           (Nos. CP. 294 (23) and CP. 296 (23).)     1.  Preliminary.         The Secretary of State for War  has circulated to the Cabinet two papers by the     General Staff  previously laid  before the Sub-Committee  on National and  Imperial     Defence.  In CP. 296 (23) the General - Staff develop a case against, the  continuance     of a separate Air Service and outline an alternative organisation; in CP.  294 (23)     they proffer  a  series of criticisms  of the Air Staff scheme for the expansion of theJl   Royal Air  Force for purposes of Home Defence, and make certain counter-proposals.     2. History of the Institution of a Separate Air Service.         It may be convenient if the Air Staff preface their comments on these  papers with       \     a brief summary of the circumstances which led to the decision of  the Cabinet in 1917            [10272]                                                         B/3JUL 1923&quot;&apos;
to create a  unified  Air Service.   This decision  was  not the outcome of obscuredoctrinaire influences; it  was taken  after much  anxious  thought and  investigationunder  the irresistible  pressure  of war necessity, and represented  the final  andinevitable stage in  a gradual process of evolution.  A whole series of  intermediateexpedients such as the Air Committee and Air Board had  first been tried and  foundwanting.  Practical experience had in  fact conclusively proved that, whatever the merits  or  demerits  of  the  existence  of  dual Naval and Military Air Services inthe early stages of  aerial development in time of peace,  such a system Was, &apos;in war, so-extravagant  and ineffective  as seriously  to  jeopardise the prospects  of  victory.Moreover, the confusion and bickerings which arose between the rival air organisationshad  become  notorious and a strong demand had  sprung up in consequence among thepublic and in Parliament for  drastic measures of reform.   The unsatisfactory conditionof Home Defence was a further factor in the situation.   As a result, the  War Cabinetappointed  a   Committee with a  dual reference  to examine, &quot; in consultation withrepresentatives of the  Admiralty,  General Staff and  Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forces, with such other experts as they may desire      &quot; (I.) The defence arrangements for Home Defence against air raids.     &quot; (2.) The air organisation generally and the direction of air operations.&quot;     This  Committee issued  two reports, the second  of  which,* a document full ofpregnant matter relevant to the present controversy, recommended, as the only possible solution of the air problem, the institution of a separate Air Force.  It is&apos; important to note that this report  expressly states that the War Office did not &quot; make any claimto a separate Air  Service of its  own.&quot;  Similarly, when  the question was brought before the Cabinet for consideration on the 2-lth August, 1917, before any decision hadbeen taken, it is on record that the War Office representatives stated  that the ArmyCouncil accepted in principle the proposal to establish  a separate Air Service.  Indeed,it appears that the War Office did not question the principle until May  1921, or two and  a half years after the Armistice.3. The General Staff arguments  for the abolition of the Air  Force.     In CP. 296/23  the General Staff develop their arguments for the abolition of the.Royal Air  Force under three main heads which may  be summarised, in order ofimportance, as follows :      (a.) That there is no  justification  for the present British organisation, inasmuch           as the Air Force is essentially a supplementary Force ;     (b.) That this organisation is extravagant, and  leads to  unnecessary duplication;     (c.) That no1 other Power has adopted it.4. Analysis of these Arguments. &apos;         (a.)  That the Air  Force is a Swppjmentary Force.     This  is  clearly the  pith of the whole matter.  It is no new contention, but was argued  out at length before the Committee  of  Imperial  Defence in  1921,  both inwriting and  orally, with the  result that Lord Balfour, in  C.I.D. 149 C, issued a reasoned summing up  decisively in favour of the  claim of the Royal Air Force to beregarded as a primary Service with its own distinctive sphere of operations, independent of and  co-equal  with  the Navy  and  Army.  It  is not here necessary  to reiterateLord Balfour&apos;s conclusions, particularly as the Secretary of  State for Air has already circulated C.I.D. 149 0&apos;.  It is sufficient&apos;to say that after careful consideration theCabinet endorsed them in toto and promulgated them to Parliament no longer ago thanMarch 1922.                                            &quot;     CP. 296 (23) does not bring to light any new point of substance which was not before Lord Balfour and the Cabinet in 1921 and 1922, when the General Staffs claims were examined and  rejected.   The Air Staff see no  reason  to modify their previousview that in the future wars may be fought primarily in the air, any action by land orsea forces being subsidiary to the main aerial campaign, and that the principal menace to which these islands are now exposed  is from the  air, a menace with which our troopsashore and fleets afloat are admittedly powerless to  cope.     It may be added that the arguments adduced by the  General  Staff  in this papercould equally be advanced  in favour of  the subordination of the Army to the Navy or     * G.T. 1638, a document which, together with the Minutes of the Cabinet Meetingof the 24th August,1917, merits careful perusal.....                                                 ,&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;
    vice versa.  For example, the General Staff make great  play with the statement that    in the case of the independent Air Commands such as Iraq,5&quot; &quot; Army control is necessary,    to put the Air Force in and ultimately to bring them out.  Sandwiched between these    two phases is  a  period of Air Force control.&quot;  From this they deduce that &quot; economy,    efficiency, continuity,&quot;  demand military  control  throughout.   It might as well be    argued that because the Navy (or Naval control) is necessary, to  get our Expeditionary    Force to an overseas theatre in  the  event of war with a Power possessing Naval forces    capable  of interfering  with our  transports, to  cover  its landing,  to safeguard its    sea-borne  supplies  of  food  and munitions,  and  ultimately,  if  hostilities  are  still    in progress, to bring it out, whilst in between are &quot;sandwiched&quot; military operations    (probably of far  shorter duration than the Air Force control) that  &quot; efficiency, economy    and continuity &quot;  demand Naval control throughout.   Again the  General Stall assert    that the  Air  Force, by  itself,  can neither achieve nor consolidate victory.  The Air    Staff affirm the  contrary.   Ground occupation following successful  attack will,  in    certain circumstances, be unnecessary since the very  factor which has brought about    the capitulation of the enemy will  still threaten him.  The power of the Air forceC^t both to/consolidate -suid-aehiere victory  has been  proved on a  small scale in Iraq,    where villages in armed revolt have,  without the intervention of  ground   troops,    capitulated to punitive action by air.  The difference between this class  of operation    and war with a country such as  Afghanistan is in degree, not in kind. Equally, air action    alone, if on a sufficient scale, may be capable of forcing a decision in a European  war.    Even, however, if the General Staffs assertion were true,  it would be no  argument for    the subordination of the Air Force to the Army.  It might be urged  i&amp;4he-lar greater O    cogency  that the Navy, whose  power of offensive action stops  short at the coast line,;    whereas  the Air  Force can strike at a nation&apos;s vitals, cannot by itself either &quot;achieve    or  consolidate victory &quot;;  that  it would, moreover,  be helpless  without  shore bases,    dockyards and  other  installations on land for the defence  of which the Army is    normally responsible;  and that accordingly it is a &quot; supplementary&quot; service which    should be brought forthwith under  the control of the Army and General Staff.              (b.)  That the existence of a separate Air Force is  extravagant and leads to                    unnecessary duplication.         The administration of the Royal Air Force has during  the  past  two years  been    subjected to detailed scrutiny by three independent tribunals.         (1.)  The  Committee  on  National  Economy  (Geddes   Committee), after  an                exhaustive investigation of this charge of extravagance, found  as follows :                     &quot; We cannot state that we have been convinced  that the Air Force is                        less economically administered than  the other fighting services.&quot;!               This Committee, moreover, whose  sole motive was  economy, refused,           despite strong pressure both by the Admiralty and War Office, to entertain           the proposal to abolish the Air Force, reporting that                &quot; Without a separate existence  theiWis a grave  danger that the Air.                    Service would be unable to work out developments  which  might                    in the next decade or so entirely revolutionise methods  of  attack                    and defence, and so render possible very large  economies  in the                    cost  of the  fighting  services  as a  whole by substituting  air for                    land and sea forces.&quot;               In this connection  they  instanced the reduction of  Middle East           estimates by some  14,000,000 as a  result  of the substitution  of air for           military  control in  IraJ^  The General Staff, it  should be remembered,           opposed the Air Staffs scheme throughout, and were only finally overruled           by the Cabinet.$   * This independent Air Command has to date proved completely successful, despite the fact that peacewith Turkey has not even yet been concluded; it has, moreover, saved the country many millions.  further economies are in prospect, and the Air Officer Commanding is anxious to reduce the Infantry garrison forth-with to six battalions;  The only obstacle to this reduction is the opposition of the General Staff in India.   t See this Committees 1st report.   t See in this connection CP. 3197 and CP. 3240.      [10272]                                                          B 2
    vice versa.  For example, the General Staff  make great play with the statement that    in the ease of the independent Air Commands such as  Iraq,* &quot; Army control is necessary,    to put the Air Force in and ultimately to bring them out.   Sandwiched between these    two phases is a  period of Air Force control.&quot;  From this they deduce that  &quot; economy,    efficiency, continuity,&quot;  demand military  control throughout.   It might as well be    argued that because the Navy (or Naval control) is necessary, to  get our Expeditionary    Force to an overseas theatre in the  event of war with a Power possessing Naval forces    capable  of interfering  with our  transports, to cover its landing,  to safeguard its    sea-borne  supplies  of  food  and munitions,  and ultimately,  if  hostilities  are  still    in progress, to bring it out, whilst in between are &quot;sandwiched&quot; military operations    (probably of far  shorter duration than the Air Force  control) that &quot; efficiency, economy    and continuity&quot; demand Naval  control throughout.  Again the General Staff assert    that the  Air  Force, by  itself, can neither  achieve  nor consolidate victory.  The Air    Staff affirm the contrary.   Ground occupation following  successful  attack  will, in    certain circumstances, be unnecessary since the very factor which has brought about    the capitulation of the enemy will  still threaten him.  The power of the Air ForceOMi- hoth to ^consolidate -aad-achieve victory  has been  proved on a small scale in Iraq,    where villages  in armed revolt have,  without the intervention of  ground   troops,    capitulated to punitive action by air.  The difference between this class  of operation    and war with a country such as Afghanistan is in degree, not in kind. Equally, air action    alone, if on a  sufficient scale, may be capable of forcing a decision in a European  war.    Even, however, if the General Staffs assertion were  true, it would be no  argument for    the subordination of the Air Force to the Army.  It might be urged  ras4k*-far greater O    cogency that  the Navy, whose power of offensive action stops  short at the coast line,    whereas the Air Force can strike at a nation&apos;s vitals, cannot by itself either &quot;achieve    or consolidate victory &quot;;  that it would, moreover,  be  helpless  without  shore bases,    dockyards  and  other installations on land  for the defence  of which the Army  is    normally  responsible;  and  that accordingly it is a &quot; supplementary &quot; service which    should be brought forthwith under the control of the Army and General Staff.              (b.)  That the existence of  a  separate Air  Force  is  extravagant and leads to                    unnecessary duplication.         The  administration of the Royal Air Force has during  the past  two  years  been    subjected to detailed scrutiny by three independent tribunals.         (1.)  The  Committee  on  National  Economy  (Geddes   Committee), after an                exhaustive investigation of this charge of extravagance, found  as follows :                     &quot; We cannot state that we have been convinced that the Air Force is                        less economically administered  than the other fighting services.&quot;!    This Committee, moreover, whose sole motive  was economy, refused,despite strong pressure both by the Admiralty and War Office, to entertainthe proposal to abolish the Air Force, reporting that     &quot; Without a separate existence theiW is a grave danger that the  Air.

I See in this connection CP. 3197 and CP.  3240.       [10272]                                                           B 2
      (2.)  The subsequent  Cabinet Committee which  conducted further  investigations            into the cost  of  the fighting  services specifically stated that they were,            &quot; like  the  Geddes  Committee,  strongly impressed  with  the  sense  of            economy and thrifty administration &quot; which they found in the Air Force.*      (3.)  The Woir Committee has recently  paid  special attention to the question  of            duplication, and their report  shows  that  under such heads as Medical,            Dental, and  Chaplain  Services, duplication  is virtually  nou-existent,  so            that no  substantial economy could  be  secured  by amalgamating these            services, whereas efficiency would  definitely suffer.  The findings of  this            Committee have recently been endorsed by the Cabinet and promulgated            to Parliament.      In the  case of Medical  Services, for example, the  Air Force already  utilises existing Naval and Military hospitals, &amp;c, wherever they are available.  Indeed, there appears to have been in the past more duplication  under this head as between^ the Army and Navy than in the case of the Air Force vis-a-vis either.   The abolition  of the Air  Force  would not  in  any way alter the  need for maintaining doctors (and chaplains) at  large Air stations, such as Cranwell  and Halton, which are remote from any Naval or Military Station.     It is easy to bring these vague  charges of  extravagance, which are difficult  to refute without going into  great detail.  The Air Staff can only say that, after perusal of  the report of  the  recent  Cabinet  Committee on  the  War  Office  and Military Establishments,^ they have nothing to, fear from a comparison of the cost of Air  and Army administration.          (c.)  That no other Power has Adopted this Organisation.     This statement is incorrect, since Italy  has decided upon the unification of her Air Services under one department.  It  may be added  that  the  United  States Aviation Mission which visited Europe after  the Armistice under the Under-Secretary of War, reported strongly in favour of  a unified Air Service under  a separate Air Department, pointing out that the British organisation had placed us &quot; well in the lead in practically every phase of aerial development&quot; though it is true that pressure of vested interests procured  the shelving of this  report;  and that, there. is in France. a strong body of opinion in favour  of the creation/of an autonomous air service under an Air Ministry after the British model.                                                    -     These considerations are, however, irrelevant, since our circumstances are radically different from those of any foreign Power.   It is as idle to argue that we  should adopt the  air organisation  at  present in  vogue in other countries more&apos;backward than ourselves, as it would have been in 1914 to  advocate that we should follow the example of  continental Powers and. constitute the  Army rather  than the Navy our  main instrument of defence. 5. The General Staffs Alternative Organisation.     The  General Staffs proposals for  an  alternative organisation, if the Air Force were abolished,  will not bear analysis.  They contemplate,  for example,  that  air formations, &quot; capable of co-operating with the Fleet on the high seas &quot; shall  be under the Admiralty, whilst &quot; Air Forces allotted to, the general pool for war &quot; shall be under the  War  Office.    These proposals  are contradictory, since  all long-range bombing aircraft in the &quot;general pool.for War&quot; could in  case of need &quot;co-operate with  the Fleet on  the  high seas&quot; up to.-the  limit of their  radius of action, which is steadily increasing.  This is indeed  one of  the main, reasons for maintaining one unified air  service, with a  single  system  of strategy,  tactics,  training and administra- tion, so  that its   weight can  be   thrown   in  any   direction into  the   naval, military   or  independent  air  spheres-according as  circumstances may  require, and the  Cabinet may  decide.   Again,  the  General  Staff  propose  to  retain   a mutilated fragment of an Air Ministry after the disintegration of the Royal Air Force, much on the lines of the old Air Board,  but with additional duties in  connection with Civil Aviation.  This half-way house  was tried but broke down in  1917 under the crucial test of war;  the whole history of  the experiment is on  record in  cabinet papers and speaks for itself.  Moreover, it would be subject to the fatal defect that it divorces the  using from the  designing and supplying authority, a  situation whichcould not fail to result in lowered, efficiency and much  friction.  Further, the  Naval Staff have definitely intimated their unwillingness to accept such a system.  But, even       * CP. 3692, paragraph 41.            f CP. 22 (23).            % CP. 274 (23).
if the  General Staffs  proposals  under this  head were  not  otherwise  impracticable,there would be no justification for the retention of a separate Air Ministry thus shornof the  great bulk of  its present functions.6. The  General  Staffs Criticism of the  Air Staffs  Scheme of B.ome Defence  and     Cou nit r-Proposals.                               .    -     Both the General Staff criticisms  and the very nebulous counter-proposals whichthey put forward in  O.P. 294 (23) appear to be based on  a complete misunderstanding of the guiding  principles underlying  the Air  Staffs scheme, the reasons  for  thepresent organisation  of the Air Force and the technical factors governing its  employ-ment in war.   For example, the General Staff include  among the questions which theFrench Staff will consider before  taking action the following:          &quot; (o.) Can our fighting squadrons give our&apos; bombing squadrons the protection     they require throughout this enterprise?&quot;  In a foot-note  they  add&apos; that their     &quot; latest information tends to show  that the radius of  action of the French fighters     is  very  limited  indeed, and  that they are not  designed  to undertake flights far     away from  their bases.  This  condition, so long as it lasts, very considerably     reduces the existing &quot;menace,&quot; as no less than 300 of  the 596 machines of the     Division Aerienne are fighters.&quot;     There are  a whole series  of   misconceptions  here.  It  is,  in  the first place,exceedingly doubtful whether the  French  General Staff  would  ask themselves  thisquestion, at least in the form suggested.  Our own policy is definitely not to providelong-distance  bombing  formations  with an  escort  of fighters;  the function of thefighters in the Air Staffs scheme of Home Defence is the protection of this country against enemy  attacks.1  The French have not yet  made up  their minds on  this problem, but in  the view of the Air Staff  their existing  fighters  are intended  for thedefence of France, not the escort  of long-distance bombing raids.  At the same  timethe General Staff are misinformed  as to the radius of action of  these fighters, whichcould, if they so desired, easily  operate over London  from advance landing  groundsnear the French coast with a comfortable margin in hand.   However, even if theirradius  of action were  much smaller than  in  fact it  is, the &quot;menace&quot;-measured(a) by  French  bombing capacity,  and (6)  by  their  power of  resistance  to  Britishcounter-attacks would in no way be reduced.     It  is obvious that  criticism based  on such an  entire misapprehension of  thetechnical factors involved has little value.     The  General. Staff  seriously misrepresent at other  points the views  of the AirStaff.  For  example, they state  that in &quot; our Navy we have  an immense power of retaliation, a factor that the Air Staff do not appear  to have taken into account.&quot;  Onthe  contrary, as long ago as  July  1922, dealing with  this very g^eat-question of thecontinental air menace and our powers of counter-attack, the  Air Staff specifically drew the  attention of the Committee  of Imperial Defence to  the  assistance- which  they expected from &quot; the bombardment of French ports by  our Naval forces.&quot;  They must,however, emphatically join issue  with the General Staff when the latter state that &quot; our first means of retaliation is the Navy.&quot; Even the  successful bombardment of a  fewFrench coastal towns would be a singularly ineffective  counter to concentrated aerialattacks on London.   The General Staff have  themselves  recorded in other papers  that&quot; they  recognise that the offensive  action of aircraft  is the  principal weapon  againsthostile air action.&quot; *     The  General  Staffs counter-proposals are vague  in the  extreme and are  marredby the same lack  of appreciation of technical factors.   They suggest  that largeeconomies could be effected by the amalgamation of  Air  Force  with Army schools.  a closer  examination  of  this proposal  shows  that,  owing  to the fact  that (a) flyingfacilities are a sine  qua non  at  almost all the Royal Air Force instructional, establish-ments, and (6) there are radical differences in the technical trades taught and generally in the  requirements  of the two Services, amalgamation is only actually feasible in thecase of one-establishment, which  has an officer staff of three.     The  General Staff also propose the reorganisation  of the instructional staff of the flying  schools on the basis that, on mobilisation,  each should  be capable of mobilisingtwo or three  fighting units.  A proposal on  these obvious lines was examined by theAir  Staff as  long   ago  as 1919.   It was  rejected  after  mature consideration as* (J.I.D.  351-B.
unworkable.    The  General  StaS  have  apparently  entirely  failed  to  appreciate-the  very. large wastage  in  flying  personnel which  will  follow immediately  onthe  outbreak of hostilities, and the  consequent need, not merely  to  maintain  all existing  flying training establishments, but  actually to provide  for their immediateexpansion.  A further suggestion is that &quot; auxiliary air units should now be organised on  a territorial basis from the  existing resources of civil aviation.&quot; , This is hardlya  constructive  proposal.   It  may  be  mentioned that the  &quot; existing   resources  ofcivil  aviation&quot;  at .the  moment consist of 30  air-worthy machines  of  13  different types, a  motley collection which  would  perhaps suffice to form one squadron  of doubtful utility, and to  maintain  it  in  action  for two months  at the  outside.   AnAuxiliary Air Force  on practical lines  is, of course, and has for years been, an essential.feature of the Air Staffs programme for Home  Defence.   The General Staff commentadversely  on the &quot; maintenance of a  large number  of  regular  service squadronsfor  the   sole  purpose of meeting  a contingency  which  it is  hoped will neveroccur.&quot;   For   what   other   purpose  is  the  Navy  maintained  except  to  meetcontingencies,  such  as  a war with  the  United  States  or  Japan,  which  it  ishoped will  never   occur?    Moreover,   it  is difficult  to  understand  why  theimportant,  auxiliary  and militia elements in  the  Air Staffs scheme  are  ignored.The  General Staff  do  not appear to  realise   that,  in  including  these non-regularelements  in  their scheme for attaining bare equality with  the number of  machines  inFrance available for employment against  this country, the Air Staff have shown their willingness to face a risk which the Naval Staff  will not incur in maintaining the Navyat  a one-Power  standard, and this despite the fact that, on the outbreak of war, airforces can be  brought  to action  even  more   rapidly than  naval forces.  In  thisconnection the&apos;Air Staff invite attention to the following quotation from  an importantFrench General Staff document:        &quot;The numerical increase (of aircraft I on mobilisation is  as yet  an unsolved     problem ; in this respect it seems that the Air Service should rather resemble the     Navy, which ought to have all its war vessels in line even in  time of peace.   The     obvious conclusion is that we ought to increase our peace Air Service.&quot;     The French General Staff thus appear to  take a diametrically  opposite view to that.of  the British General Staff  as to  the  best  method of provision for aerial  security.They  regard the only solution as the maintenance of large standing regular air forces,and are  not prepared  to place  any reliance  either on territorial schemes or on  the utilisation of the resources of civil aviation, despite the fact that this has been developedon a far larger scale in France than in this country.Air Staff, July 5, 1923.
