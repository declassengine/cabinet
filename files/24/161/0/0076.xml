CAB nn,                      RQPARA2I0i!S  POLICY.Hote by the Lord Privy Seal,covering Proposed /statement of     Government Policy.         I venture to circulate to my colleagues the annexed Memorandum on the Reparations policy of the Govern-ment.   I have thrown&apos;it into the form of a statement ofpolicy which might be communicated to our Allies and published,                                (Intd.)  R.C.ust 4th. 1983.
       It  is  still  true . til ait  the  greatest  of  British  interests  is Peace.  And  by Peace  is  meant  not  merely  the cessation  Of war but  the restoration to its normal  condition  of world economic civilisation.   That is the interest  of  all progressive  nations. It is  especially the  interest  of a country like  Great Britain whoso  life literally  depends on  commerce  and the free interchange of goods.  She imports four-fifths of the corn and one  third of the  meat  required  to  feed her  people and  nearly  all  tho raw material  for her great textile industries.   To pay for  those she must export  an equivalent amount of  coal  and manufactured articles.  Moreover her  shipping industry and the groat money market:-of London are  dependent for their  prosperity  on  unrest&amp;selected international  intercourse.   It is  therefore  small wonder  that any  dislocation of the commercial  system  of  the  world resulting from political unrest or military  operations is  immediately reflected in vfidespread  unemployment in Great Britain.  Hundreds of thousands of British  men, women and  children  ore  at  the present day  suffering privation  and  even  the want of the necessaries  of life in consequonce of the economic situation in Germany and  Central Europe.       Apart  then from any more soneral  reasons it is end  must  be a fundamental  object  of  British  policy  to secure the settlement at the earliest possible moment  of those  grave questions  between the  Allies and Germany which are now distracting Europe.   The British Government, like other creditors, desires the payment of debts  owing to  it.  But it  desires still  more an  early economic  settlement of Eur&amp;pe, and if that can only  be  secured by sacrifices  even of claims in  themselves just  and  reasonable, it,is prepared  to make them.  That  is why  it desires to limit our demands on Germany to an amount  within  her capacity  to  pay,  for only so can  the present  disastrous state  of  things be rapidly brought to an  end.
        It must be recognised that in. Prance and Belgium adifferent view is taken.   The devastation of their territoriesby German invasion, though the actual material loss inflictedhas not been perhaps much greater than, the economic injuriessuffered by the population of Great Britain in consequence ofthe isar, excites a far deeper and more poignant indignation.The destruction is palpable and evident, a clamant  witness tothe relentless malignity of German militarism.   With suchprovocation the French and Belgian Governments listen withimpatience to discussions of how much Germany can pay;  and areinclined to cut them short bv declaring that justice requirespayment and it is for the Germans to say how it shall be made.If the result of this attitude is the ruin of Germany, so much                                             notthe worse for her.  At any rate she will then/be able to repeat the crime of 1914.        Por the reasons explained above Great Britain is unableto accept this view.  But her position is complicated by theterms of-the Treaty of Versailles and the London Agreement of1921.   Bv those documents the Commission of Reparations has aright to fix, and has fixed, the sum total of German liabilities,and Great Britain is precluded by her signature from disputingthe amount.  Prance and Belgium are, therefore, entitled to claim what they please within those limits whatever may be the consequence to Germany or Great Britain or the rest of the world.That is the bond.        If then we are to arrive at a solution of our difficulties this position must be faced.  Prance and Belgiumare not asking for more than their legal rights,  just as we andothers  have the legal right to insist on the payment of our fulldebt from our Alliesa  It is true that if we all insist on our                                                     rights...
rights there does not seem any chance for the economic restora-tion of Europe for many decades,  or perhaps generations.   Thatwill be a disaster to Great Britain.  It will also be, at thevery least, a grave misfortune to the rest of the  world.   Forthe civilised world is one economic Whole and though localciroumstances may conceal this fact it will in the end makeitself felt.   The collapse of Germany will affect not only those nations who have direct trade relations with her, butthrough them an ever widening circle of other countries.        What then can be done?   It is clear that  a solutioncan only be found In a reasonable arrangement in which allinterested parties, that is, all  the principal countries  inEurope and America, shall concur.   How Is that to be arrivedat?   In the first place it may be of help to examine what arethe chief claims put forward.   In France and, Belgium the firstdemand is for the reparation of the devastated territories.The minumum sum asked for in this connection is in Francetwenty-six milliards, and in Belgium five milliards of goldmarks.   Great Britain is entitled to 22$ of any sum receivedfrom Germany, and Italy Q%.  Other claims come to        In addition to those first line demands France declares that if she has to pay sums due to her Allies, and especially to Great Britain, she must proportionately increase her claim on Germany.   As regards the debt to Great Britain the positionis made more difficult by reason of the fact that  Great Britairhas to pay, and is paying, her debt to the U.S.A.    It wouldseem very unjust for one Ally to  have to pay its debts toanother and yet to be precluded from recovering what is due  toit from a third.   In any case it is clear that the questionsof debts and  reparations, must be  dealt with as a whole andsettled together.        According to the British thesis, the whole position is                                                         in/
  the end governed by the amount recoverable from Germany.  &quot;there there is nothing the King loses his rights&quot;.    The  first step therefore, as we think,  is to  ascertain the  capacity to pay of Germany.   It is said  that  this Cannot be  done since the factors of the  problem are continuously- changing.    There may be a difficulty in  reaching  a  scientifically accurate conclusion.    But that  is  not  absolutely necessary if the main Object be to  arrive a$ a  settlement of the question which.shall be reasonably fair.  After all, predictions of the  financial capacity of a  country are common enough and  in many cases both public -  in framing the financial policy of  a country -  and private  -  in estimating the value of ah  investment  - are  acted upon  where important interests are  involved.  We refuse to  believe  that experts given access to all available information could  not make an estimate, sufficiently  trustworthy for action,  of the future financial capacity of Germany, and would easily  discount. such local and passing circumstances  as the present  condition of her budget and her currency.    And if not what -  is the alternative except to leave  hanging over Eruope and  Germany this vast financial uncertainty as to  how  much her  liabilities will eventually be - a  position fatal  alike to  any serious attempt on her part to  grapple with her financial  difficulties and to the economic recovery of Europe which  demands more than all else certainty as to the  future  position.       It is next said that there is  no need to  call in  other  experts since, the Reparation Commission is designed to do this  very work.   But surely this is not  so.    In the end the  Commission, as its history shows, is a political body  bound to  take ita orders from&quot;the Governments it represents.    Can
anyone seriously believe that a body of that kind, witha permanent majority of the governments holding one set of opinions on these questions, will ever be accepted as asatisfactory tribunal to determine the matter in question?Suppose the majority were the other way, would French and.Belgian opinion accept it?  Surely not.   As between theAllies and Germany it may be said that the Treaty has established it and must be followed, though even there itmay be permissible to doubt whether you will ever succeed in creating the &quot;will to pay&quot; in Germany through thisinstrument.   But in the present case the discussion is between the Allies themselves, and they have surely a rightto ask that the difference between them shall be referredto a body completely disinterested.   The British Governmentwould be quite content to accept a body nominated by theCouncil of the League of Nations or by the President of theUnited States.     Assuming that Germany&apos;B capacity to pay can be determinedby some means it would seem probable that the sum sofixed would exceed the two sums of twenty-six milliards and five milliards claimed by Prance and Belgium for devastation.The Italian claim has been the subject of negotiation withthe British Government, and could also almost certainly be met (state result of negotiations).   There remains the British claim, and the British Government would beprepared, in order to attain a final settlement, toconsider favourably how far It could accept the principle thatthe French as well as the Belgian claim above mentioned shouldbe given priority.   Much must of course depend on the figurefixed.   But as it has already said, the British Governmentis prepared to go a very long way in order to re-eetablishthe economic system of Europe.
          The next thing to he settled, would be what pledgeaehould be asked for from Germany to ensure payment.  On thispoint also the British Government svould look for valuableadvioe from the proposed expert commission.   They oan say inadvance that once the capacity of Germany is fixed and the pledges settled the British Government would be prepared tojoin in any action necessary to make them effective.   one other thing would certainly have to be done.   Much of thefinancial chaos in Germany Is due to the mistakes and weakness ofher Government and as part of the settlement and in return forthe very considerable advantages that she would get from it, she would have to accept come measure of supervision similar to thatwhioh has be^n operating so successfully In Austria under theLeague of Nations.       It is clear under this scheme that Germany would be enabled to recover her financial position.   Indeed if she ie to pay her  .debts this is essential.   Nor ia it in itself an evil.  True,she might become  a formidable competitor.   But however formidableshe were she could not  do  so much harm to her rivals aa she isnow doing by her  ruin.   Indeed, the view that the prosperity of one country ia in the long run an injury to the others isaltogether untrue.   It is far more true to say that nationslike  individuals  stand  or  fall together.   The prosperity of onetends to  the prosperity of all,  Just aa the ruin of one Is  aneconomic evil to  all.      But the military  revival of Germany ia another matter, andthat  may  well follow her economic recovery.   None of tha allies in the late  war with a  recollection of what they then went through  and  an observation of the state of mind now/
prevailing in Germany can view her possible military revivalwith equanimity.   Against the dangers whioh might follow from that eventuality it behoves us all to take precautions,and the British Government would be ready to consider withits Allies whet stops it would be desirable to take.   It maywell be that the problem could best be approached as an example,perhaps the most urgent example, of the menace to the securityof Europe, and even of the world, caused by the present international position and armaments.     The preceding observation deal with the general situation.But it is clear that if a genuine settlement is to be reachedthe situation in the Ruhr must be liquidated.   On that point the British Government have recently had an opportunity of expressing their view and not much need be added.   It isenough to sey that they hold that passive resistence by germany should be immediately abandoned, that es soon as possibleafterwards the military character of the occupation should cease,and that es soon as other pledges have been given arid acceptedthe occupation itself should come to an end.   The BritishGovernment feel very strongly that as a means of directlyobtaining payment the occupation cannot succeed, and as a measureoi: coercion against Germany it is only effective in proportion to its destruction of her power to pay.     Finally, if these views were accepted in principle theBritish Government would propose to summon, if possible underthe auspices of the League of Nations, a Conference to whichthe U.S.A. should be invited, to discuss the details ofthe proposed arrangement.     In concluding these observations the British Government                           M 7 &apos;J
cannot refrain from expressing the earnest hope that afinal, settlement of the European situation will&quot; be arrived at.     It Is now nearly five years since the end of themost desolating war, in history.   -It&quot;&apos;is more than fouryears since the Treaty of Versailles was signed.    that treaty begins with the words: &quot;in order to promoteinternational co-operation&quot;,    Surely it is time to putthat aspiration into practice and finally to Close achapter in the world&apos;3 history which has caused 3uchinfinite suffering to mankind.
