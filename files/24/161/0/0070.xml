(raiS^DWJUMMT^IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)gE, C RE T.C.P,  370  (23).                            C A B I NET                    THE BUDGET SITUATION 1923/24.      Memorandum by the Finanolal  Secretary to  the Treasury. 1.        The Budget of this year balanced at 818^ millions   * with a margin of  1,800,000 but without any speoial pro-vision for Supplementary Estimates.  The Budget revenue concessions ware estimated to oost  780,000 this year.  It is too early yet to form any reliable opinion how far the Budget estimates of Revenue will be realised.  The figures at present are satisfactory but my advisers think having regard to the trade depression which set in two months ago that the tendency willbe for  the revenue of the year to bo rather under the estimatesthan above them.   Assuming however the Budget Revenue estimatesto be realised,  our surplus would be just over a million.2i        Against this we have already to set 3^- millions  forAgricultural Rates grant,   2,419,000 for the supplementary estimates just presented  ( 4,419,000 less  2 million to be refunded by Rhodesia)  and we have further Civil supplementary estimates to whioh we  are already committee of  350,000 and an air Supplementary Estimate for a further  500,000;  and moreoverwe do not know our full liabilities fcr the Sutton judgment,&apos;&quot;or.what will be lord Ct-lwy^s award on the payments to Northern Ireland.          We are therefore already at best 6-^ millions to  thebaa, against the million surplus,   for tho net additionalrequirement of 5 million we have to look to current savings on the estimates already presented.
         3.    Over and above all  this  come the  demands for CP.     further provieioh  for Unemployment.*   Excluding telephone (22).         capital (whioh does not  directly affect the ordinary         Budget of the year) the  full  suggestions of the Unemploy-         ment  Committee would cost  1,300,000 in the ourrent year         (including the Post Offioe tube railway erroneously         quoted as a loan work), assuming that the  750,000 for        roads Involved no charge on the Exchequer.             Tbe least extensive of tho Unemployment Committee             f;        programmes would oost   1 million this year.        4.   But this is not all,             In another paper  I have explained the great        difficulties which will face us on  the Budget  ofee CP,   1924/25.^     The Unemployment Committee programme69 (23)        enhances those  difficulties  because the oharges  for        thjs winter^s unemployment  schemes will amount to         6SSS5C per  annum for  tho  full soheme  and l&apos;M5,0i?0  p,a.        for  the lesser  scheme.                           .             It hag  got  to be remembered that although  WiyWO        18 the approximate  amount for  next year&apos;s estimates, the        total oost to the State  of remedying unemployment which        will all ba  finished in  this winter, ie roughly  ten        millions, and I  submit that  it is hardly wise finanoe        to spread your Doctor&apos;s  bill  over fifteen years.             If you  have  more unemployment next winter ana        tho  following winter, I  presume it will be suggested        that we should spend another ten millions spreading        tho  payment  over  a  further fifteen years in each case.
     My figures make no allowance for any risks we run of having to provide money to faoa our guarantees of 26 millions under the Export Credits Scheme and  50millions under the Trade Facilities rabies.     We are alao committed to  400,000 per annum for? years for the Commercial Airship Scheme.     5.   So far I have spoken only Of definite proposalshacked by Cabinet Committees and immediately affectingthe current year;         But let it not be supposed, that  this1 is all.We have other  considerable items in the offing.Necessitous Areas.        The Minister of Health proposes the expenditurethis year of one million  and in  the years 1924 and 1925at least two millions, if the hardships continue.Empire Development.       The President of the Board of  Trade scheme proposesto spend up to  2,000,000 a year for  15 years on  oontributions to  interest payable on loans  raised here bythe Dominions.                               /Universities Grant,,     1 have been  appealed to by  all  the UniversityMembers for a  grant of  300,000  in  addition to  thepresent one..War Losses,.     Finally,  If  I  were to yield to  the  appeals whichare made  to me to pay  British  subjects  in foreigncountries their  war losses  (Belgium,  Prance, Roumania,Russia),&apos;!  could  easily spend  30 -*  40 millions.
     6.   My colleagues necessarily get few oppor-tunitiea of considering our financial position as awhole.   I ask them no* to view our commitmentsgenerally and not he led away hy natural enthusiasm for particular items.   However attraotive such items maybe, increased taxation in the next Budget Willeffectually1 wipe out all feelings of electoral gratitude.    7,   The immediate action which I suggest is asfollows:-        (a)   that the Cabinet endorse the proposal in              Paper CiP.369 (23),  rationing the              Fighting. Services for 1924/25 to a total              of  112*500,000        (b)   that the Unemployment Programme this              winter should be the lowest of the three              alternatives put forward by the Unemploy-              ment Committee.        (c)   that the maximum sum we can allow for              contributions to Empire Development schemes              should be  1 million par annum which must              be found out of the  3 million per annum              authorised (but not spent) under the              Empire Settlement Act,        (d)   that further proposals involving any con-              siderable expenditure  (e.g. Necessitous              Areas) in the next 2 or 3 years must be              turned down and that all Departments should              be BO Informed by the Treasury.TREASURY CHAMBERS,     July 31at 1923.
