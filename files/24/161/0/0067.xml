The Sub-Committee consideredthe proposals of the Financial Secretary to the WarOffice which were as follows:-
     (a)    That  great-war caBos should go to the Oommlttee           as  at present constituted.     (b)    That  with regard to cases relating to post-war           ex-Service  men,  the Legion Ghould be at liberty           to  take suoh cases up with the Departments direct.           In  other words,  the Legion ohould have free aocess           to  the Sofvico Departments in all such oases.(4)    The  Sub-Comiaittee accepted - subject to verbalmodifications- proposal (a)j   as to (b) the Minister ofPensions pointed out that the present Standing Joint Committoewas  constituted  under  the joint aegis of the Minister ofLabour and the Minister of  Pensions:  that in fact it dealtvery largely with pensions  matters,  but tho Ministry ofPensions   did  not deal with any question affecting the postGreat War  ox-sorvico mon, and,  in his opinion, it would benecessary  to reconstitute the Standing Joint Committee if such questions  were to be included in its scopo.With this  contention tho Sub-committee agreed.(5)    A discussion then ensued as to Whether tho right of representation could be given to the British Legion.   the under Secretary  of State for War expressed the opinion that other Organisations, representing post war ex-service men,should bo  heard  if they so  desired!.   further that it must rest with  the  War Offioe whether they give personal interviewsto complainants.     The Sub-Committee agreed that thoy could not recommendany  procedure  which gave the  British Legion,  or its representatives,  an exclusive right to represent post-warog^Borvice mon.(6)    Tho  Chairman suggested that proposal (b) of the
Financial Secretary to tho War Office should be modified so as to read as follows:-     &quot;(b)   That with regard to cases relating to poet-war            ex-Servico men they should not be considered            as within the jurisdiction of the Standing            Joint Committee on Ex-Service Men&apos;a Questions,            but tho British Legion should be at liberty to            take such cases up with the Departments            concerned direct, and for this purpose the            Logion should have access to the Departments            in all suoh cases&quot;.     Tho paragraph as amended was agreed to by tho Sub-Committeo.(7)   The recommendations of the Sub-Committoo are thereforeas follows:-     (a)   That matters affecting ex-service men who           served in the Great War should be considered           by the Standing Joint Committee on Ex-Service           Men&apos;s Questions as at present constituted.     (b)   That matters relating to post-War ex-Servioe           men 3hould not bo considered as within the           jurisdiction of the Standing Joint Committee           on Ex-Service Men&apos;s Questions, but the           British Legion should bo at liberty to take           such cases up with the Departments concerned           direct, and for this purpose the Legion should           have access to the Departments in all such           cases.(8)   If the Cabinet aro able to approve the recommendationsof the Sub-Committee, it is proposed to inform the british legion accordingly.(Intd.)
