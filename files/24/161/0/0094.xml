C A B I 5 E I,      It is necessary that the Government should now come to adecision as to the policy to be adopted with regard to the regulation or restriction of the use of lead paints-  whatever the decision may be on the controversial question whether weshould ratify the Geneva Convention which provides inter aliafor the prohibition of lead paint for internal work in 1927,legislation will, in any case, be required to enable theHome Office to make regulations with regard to the use of leadpaint and the rubbing down or scraping of surfaces paintedwith lead paint.  A draft code of regulations has been agreedupon by the Home Office and the employers and operativesconcerned, but legislation will be necessary to bring them into operation since the existing Factory Acts do not applyto ordinary house painting operations.      The question to be decided is whether (a) legislationshall be limited to a provision enabling such regulations tobe made, or whether  (b) the Geneva Convention shall be ratified and  effect given by  legislation to the Article inthat Convention which provides for the prohibition cf leadpaint in internal work as from the year 1927.      If the  Government decide to limit the Bill to a power tomake regulations, there will  be no controversy as to thedesirability  of regulations  (on this point all parties are agreed)/ but  we  shall be severely criticised for failure to ratify  the International Convention and to carry out the compromise which was agreed on by all parties at Geneva in,394(23).HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.WHITE  L E A DoMemorandum by the Home Secretary.
the Autumn of 1921.   On the other hand,  if we  decide to  ratify the Convention and to prohibit the use of lead paint in internal work as from 1927, we shall have to meet oppositionorganised by the White Lead Corroders, who have now abandoned the compromise which they accepted in 1921. The trade interestsmainly concerned in this country are (a) the White LeadOorroderB;  (b) the Master Painters.  The National Federationof Master Painters,  representing, the firms actually engagedin painting work and employing the workers affected by tboConvention, adheres to the Geneva compromjoe and is in favourof ratification, but the White Lead Corroders  have enlistedthe support of the National Confederation of Employers,  the master Builders^&apos;&quot; and other interests; and will put up a strongfight against ratification.                   - .      The history of the matter is briefly as  follows.  a departmental Committee appointed by the Home Offioe in 1911to investigate the use of  lead paints in the painting of buildings, reported in favour of the prohibition of lead paint(except for special classes of decorative painting work cf veryminor importance).  At the Washington International LabourConference of  1919 a Committee,.of which the British TechnicalAdviser  (Dr. Legge, the Senior Medical inspector of Factories)was Chairman,  recommended  that the question of prohibition ofthe use of white  lead in house painting should be placed on theAgenda at  the  next Conference and this recommendation was unanimously  adopted by the Conference.  At the international conference at  Geneva in 1921, the question was violently  :debated and  at the end of  a long  controversy it appeared thatthe two parties for and against prohibition were nearlyevenly balanced,  and that  no recommendation or convention was   *The Master Builders do a  certain  amount of rough painting,but they  do  not represent  the painting craft and all agreements,made  by. the  Operatives Union are with the Master Painters - notwith  the  Master Builders.
likely to be carried.   When a deadlock was imminent,  a strongappeal was made to the parties by Dr, Legge (one of the British.representatives who is a recognised expert on questions of lead poisoning) to come to an agreement, and, at-the last moment a compromise was arrived at whioh provided for prohibition of useof lead for interior painting after November, 1927, and thatregulations for the use of lead paint should be brought intooperation at once.  A Convention on these lines was adoptedunanimously (except for one abstention) at the last sitting ofthe Conference, though it should be mentioned that the chiefrepresentative of the British Government  (Sir Montague Barlow)explained that he voted in favour  of the Convention on thebasis  of the compromise being satisfactory and acceptable toall parties.  As will be seen the  compromise is no longeracceptable to one of the parties.       It had been originally intended that the british delegation should adopt a neutral  attitude at the  1921Conference because the Office of Works, which had  previouslyaccepted the findings of the Committee  of  1911, declared inthe&quot; Spring of  1921 that their views  had changed and that further  experience had shewn that  leadless paints  were less efficient and  less economical.  As a result, the BritishGovernment had  set up, before the  Conference met,  a new committee, of which Sir Henry Norman was Chairman, to re-examinethe question.   This Committee presented a  unanimous report inFebruary,  1923.   They  could not  support the  recommendation, of the Committee  of  1911 that the use of  lead paint for thepainting of buildings  should be-entirely  prohibited, but they  thought  the  agreement reached at  Geneva was a satisfactory compromise  and recommended that  legislation  should be passed to give  effect  to the  principles  therein  contained.  At the same  time,  however, they  suggested that there ware two subsidiary  points in  the  Convention  requiring further
consideration.   These two points will be dealt.with later.      It will be seen,  therefore,  that the considerations infavour of ratification of the Convention are strong.   Thechief points are -   that &quot;the riBk of lead poisoning incurred by house-painters   is serious and indisputable (the recent suggestion that  some   of the poisoning is due to turpentine and not to lead has   been entirely exploded);  that owing to the nature of the   industry this risk cannot be effectively met, as it is met   in factory processes, by exhaust fans and other safety   regulations, that substitutes for lead paints are available,   at any rate, for internal work, where the danger from lead   dust is greatest, and that on these grounds - quite apart   from the Convention - there has been for many years a   strong body of influential opinion in this country in   favour of some measure of prohibition4indeed, but for the   War, the Home Office would have pressed for legislation to   carry out the recommendations of the Committee of 1911;   that the Convention represented a compromise between   contending views in a controversy which had lasted for   years and which the employers and  (at that time) the   manufacturers of the lead which is used in making paint   were anxious to get settled;                                        *   that  it was  adopted  on  a  suggestion  of one of the British   Government  delegates  and was  supported by  the whole of the   British delegates,  official,  employers and workers;    that,  as  a  result  of it,  the controversy has ceased but   will certainly revive if  the compromise  is repudiated;    that the Convention,  including the provision as to    prohibition, is supported by the  recent  Norman Committee    (except on two subsidiary points);
  that the Master painters of this country, who are the  employers&apos; organisation mainly concerned, aro strongly in i  favour of ratification - it is they who- will have to face  the trouble if tho workers  join battle again over this issue.  Moreover, this Federation points out that should the  Government endorse the lead manufacturers&apos; attitude and  reject the limited degree of prohibition proposed in the  Convention while imposing regulations on the workers, the  chance of the regulations becoming effective will be greatly  lessened.  The workers will feel that they have been &quot;let  down&quot; and will be likely to adopt a hostile rather than a  friendly attitude;   and if  the regulations are rendered  ineffective by the attidude of the workers and lead poisoning  continues to be prevalent in the industry, the way will be  open for a revival by them  of the campaign in favour of  complete prohibition.      If,  on the other hand,  the Government decide in favour of ratification, the main  arguments which will be usod against thispolicy are  as follows -      (1) The lead manufacturers say that the amount of lead  used in  interior painting was under-estimated at Geneva.  The  figure of the loss involved by the prohibition in internal  .  work was put then at 10 per cent and the load manufacturers   say they now estimate it at 40 per cent.  As far as the   Home Office  can  ascertain,  if allowance  is made for   buildings which will be exempted under the Convention, the   total  loss in demand te the White Lead Manufacturers from   prohibition would probably  not exceed 15 per cent.      (2)  It will be urged that the recent  invention of water-&apos;   proof   -endpaper will obviate all difficulties in the way of   replacing dry  &quot;rubbing down&quot;  (the dangerous process which   gives  rise  to  the lead dust) by wet. &quot;rubbing down&quot;, and BO
  remove all dangers of lead dust,  and that therefore there is  no need for prohibition.  It is true that waterproof sandpaper  is a valuable invention which may have a very great influence  in diminishing the risk of, lead poisoning,- but it will be  extremely difficult and will probably be the work of years to  induce workmen - particularly in a scattered.and imperfectly  organised industry - to abandon the practice of dry &quot;rubbing  down&quot; which has been in use for generations, and to uae the  new process consistently.  Moreover, it cannot, at the best,  eliminate all risk.  It must be remembered that, owing to the  nature of the industry, anything like systematic Government  inspection would be impracticable, even if we could afford  the large addition to the Factory Inspection Staff that would  be needed.      (3) It will be argued that the prohibition of the use of  white lead, even for internal painting, will have a serious  effect&apos; on the lead industry in Australia, which ie one of the  largest  producers of lead in the world.  The Australian  delegates at Geneva were strong  opponents of prohibition, both  total and partial.  They finally voted in favour of the  compromise adopted, but, no doubt, their arguments against  prohibition will  again  be produced.      (4) It will be said  that prohibition favours the zinc  manufacturers of Prance as  against the white? lead manufacturer  *f  England.      On the merits  it would  seem right  to  decide  to ratify the geneva Convention  as soon  as  the necessary  legislation is passed and  to  introduce a  Bill to provide  (a) for  immediateregulations - which will be wanted  both  for  exterior work, wherethe  use of  lead paint will not be restricted, and for interiorwork in the interval before prohibition  oomes into force; and  (is)for  prohibition of lead paint  in internal work  after November,
                                                      in1927j   but  If this, policy  is  adopted  the two  subsidiarypoints  referred to above, must be consideredi -      (1) The prohibition  in  the Geneva Convention  is  subject   to  an exception for  railway stations or  &quot;industrial   establishments&apos;1.  The Norman Committee point  out that  an   extension of this exemption to cover some  public buildings   which are not industrial establishments,  such as police   ^   courts,  county courts,  post offices and  other buildings   much frequented by the  general public, is  deBirabIet   No   doubt;  such an -extension would be  desirable,  chiefly  on   the ground of economy,  since such  zinc paints as are  at   present  &quot;available cannot stand as  much washing as lead   paints and would require more frequent renewal.   But  it   is probable that by 1927 the leadless paints  will have   improved, and, in any case, this comparatively minor   objection should not be allowed to stand in the way of   ratification,&apos; if, on general grounds, the policy of   ratification is accepted by the Government.  Ratification   with a reservation on this point is out  of the question.   Ratification with reservation is not contemplated by  the   Treaty and such a policy would be  liable to be limitated   and extended by other countries to such  an extent that   Conventions would become ineffective.   The Office, of  Works,   on whose suggestion the Norman Committee recommended  the   extension, do not wihh to  press the point if  it should   prove to be the only obstacle in the way of ratification   of the Convention.       (2) Article 3 of the Convention prohibits  the employment   of women and young persons under eighteen in any painting   work of an industrial character involving the use of  white   lead, etc  The intention was that the prohibition should   extend only to the painting of buildings,  but, owing  to the
9J.160-167.    haste  with which the  Article was  drafted,  its  terms  are!    wider  than was  intended.  It is understood, however,  as a    result of inquiries which the  International Labour Office    have made, that there is a general agreement among those    who were concerned in the drafting of the Convention as to    the sense in which the Article is to be interpreted,  I    would  propose that in ratifying the Convention the British    Government should make it clear that they interpret  Article 3    as applying only to the painting of buildings, and  should    make it a condition of our ratification that  other  ratifying    States accept this interpretation.  Conditional ratification,    i.e.,  ratification which is only to take effect if,  or when,    a certain condition is fulfilled, does not appear to me to    be open to the objections which apply to ratification    with reservation, and is, I teelieve, regarded as quite    legitimate.       I attach  (1) a copy  of the Geneva Convention, and (2)  the Report of the Korraan Committee.  .                                   .W. C. B.3rd September, 1923.

The full list of witnesses will be found in Appendix I.It  includes representatives of  various Government departments and organisations of employers  and workers, scientific investi-:gators who have carried out recent pathological, chemical or otherresearch in problems connected with painting, manufacturers of lead  and leadless  paint bases, works&apos;  chemists,  officials of thepainting departments of large  contractors  and foremen painters.  &apos;.Six  of  the  witnesses,   viz.,  Sir  PL  G-oadby, ProfessorArmstrong, Messrs.  Butterworth, Cookson,  Gibson and Klein,&apos;arid our  colleague, Dr. Legge, took, part in the Third  Inter-&apos; national  Labour Conference held at  Geneva  in October  and november, 1921, at which the Draft Convention on the  Prohibi-tion of the Use, of White Lead in Painting was adopted.:   The matters presented for our review, and.further elucidationwere for  the most part examined at length by the two Depart-mental Committees8 which were appointed in 1911 to investigate the incidence of lead poisoning in the two largest trades concernedwith painting, viz.,  buildings and vehicles respectively.. Their conclusions  and   recommendations  will be  found  in  thereports!  which embody the results  of their  inquiries.   Stated shortly, the chief recommendation made by both Committees wasthat the use of lead compounds in paint, except for special classes  * (1) Departmental Committee appointed to investigate the Danger attendanton the Use of Paints containing Lead in the Pointing of Buildings.

of decorative painting work of very minor importance, should be entirely prohibited with the exception  of a  small  percentage.The Coach  Painting*  Committee  made this recommendationunanimously, but there was one dissentient from the proposalamong the members of the House Painting*  Committee.   It isnecessary  to review briefly the  grounds  on which such drasticproposals  were put forward. Both Committees were satisfied from the evidence which theyheard, and  the  statistical information then  available, that theextent of  lead poisoning among painters was serious. The Committees were, moreover, satisfied as to the main reason why painters run such  a  serious risk of lead poisoning.    Allauthorities appear to agree that inhalation of air laden with thefine dust of lead compounds is  the chief channel of lead absorp-tion.   Painted  surfaces,  as is well known, are  in  many casesrubbed down with dry sandpaper  to  produce  the  necessarysmoothness  and  evenness of surface  for  the application of freshcoats of paint.   Fine dust is inevitably  produced in the processof dry rubbing down, and if this dust contains  lead compound thepainter must inhale it.   Entry  into  the  system, by way of thealimentary tract, is of less importance but is not negligible. The principal lead compound used in  paints, mainly becauseof its marked durability, is white lead (basic carbonate of lead).It  is very poisonous.   Other poisonous  compounds of lead are used in painting, notably basic lead sulphate, adopted to  someextent in recent years  as a white base, in some circumstances as  a substitute  for  white lead; red lead,  largely required forpriming  coats for woodwork and for the  painting  of iron andsteel; chromate of lead, in order to colour paint; and litharge, asa drier.    Although these other lead compounds are used inpainting  operations, without doubt  the lead poisoning  amongpainters is mainly due  to white lead owing to the much greaterquantity  of  this material used in such work. The prohibition of the use in paint of these lead compounds,and particularly  of white  lead,  is  impracticable   unless  anadequate supply of equally efficient but non-poisonous substitutesis available to replace  them.    This substitution also must be capable of being effected without appreciable increase in paintingcosts.  The Committees of 1911 were convinced that efficient non-poisonous substitutes were available in  adequate quantity,  andthat then compulsory use would not involve  financial loss, butthey did not, themselves, initiate any definite tests. Zinc bases (with a  proportion,  of varnish)  were the  chiefsubstitutes for white lead which were at that time regarded as satisfactory and are the only ones which need be considered inreviewing their reports.   These  bases   have  for many  years been advancing in favour for  internal  painting, very  largely 0 Throughout this  report  the Committees are  referred to  as the HousePainting Committee and Coach Painting Committee respectively.4.1653
 because, for white  surfaces,  they maintain their colour  better than white lead.  The advocates of zinc oxide asserted that pro- vided  proper attention  was  given to  the  preparation  of the paint and  to its application it  satisfied, all the requirements of external durability  also.    The  House  Painting  Committee accepted this claim no doubt mainly because of the striking evi- dence  in support of it given  by the Officials of H.M. Office of Works.    We  shall refer  to Government policy in  a  special section, but it is sufficient to say here that this Department, since 1907, had  adopted what  was practically a leadless  programme for the painting of Government  buildings.   This development in its painting methods had come about in consequence of the  Home Office, in 1901, having drawn the attention of the Department to the question  of lead poisoning among  painters.  It was claimed that the change had been effected without financial loss and the results had been equally satisfactory as compared with lead paint-  As regards the painting  of  vehicles  the Coach Painting Com- mittee received evidence from  several  important firms  of the success of zinc oxide as  a  substitute for white lead.   The coats of paint applied to the better  class of carriage are well protectedwith several  coats of varnish,  and the problem of substitution is therefore not so difficult,  but even so  many of the  witnessesdisagreed with the claim that leadless paints gave equal results.  The Committees considered  the alternative policy of subjecting the painting  industries  to  codes of regulations drawn  up on lines similar  to those which  have been applied to the various industries, carried on in  factories and  workshops, in  which leaddust is the  risk to be controlled.   The  success of the factory andworkshop regulations is secured  by the constant  work of inspec- tion carried out by the factory  inspectors.  The painting of build-ings bad not been subjected to  any system of  inspection, andthe House  Painting Committee considered that it would be im-possible to  set up an efficient  system owing to&apos; the peculiar diffi-culties associated with the work.   Por example, unlike the factoryworker, the painter is always  changing his workplace.  Similarly,  no solution of the  dust problem arising  from dryrubbing  down  was  apparent  to  the  Committee.  The  dustproblem in the  factory is, as a rule,  a  localized one,  and that being so the dust produced  in the  processes can  usually beshepherded by means of suitable air guides to a fan, and so beremoved.   In this way the dust  does not  enter the  air of theworkroom and is not  inhaled by  the  worker.  There was noknown scheme of localized exhaust applicable  to  the  painter&apos;work.  On the other hand the prohibition of  dry rubbing downwas not regarded as a practicable step.  The  Committee were further  convinced that the provision  ofthe necessary arrangements to  ensure a minimum standard  of suitable accommodation for washing, etc., would be both  costlyand difficult.
  Accordingly the alternative of regulations was rejected by theHouse Painting Committee on four main grounds :     (1) the inadequacy of regulations to cope with the evil;    (2) the difficulty of prohibiting dry rubbing down ;    (3) the cost  and difficulty of  complying with various pre-           cautionary measures;    (4) the insuperable difficulty  of  enforcing regulations  by           adequate inspection.   (Cd.  7882, p. 89.)  On  the other hand, the Coach Painting Committee were of theopinion that regulations were practicable for that industry because it is carried on in factory or workshop premises and  they weremoreover convinced that any initial difficulties of compliance couldbe overcome.  They nevertheless recommended, in line with theHouse Painting Committee,  the  prohibition of lead as the best solution of the problem, on.the  ground  that a majority of theleading manufacturers was likely to prefer this solution.  The report of the House Painting Committee  deals at some length with the laws and regulations concerning the painting of buildings which were already in force  in  Prance, Belgium, Ger-many, Austria and  Switzerland.   The various foreign require-ments are  included in the  appendices  in Vol.  111*  of  theCommittees&apos; series  of  reports.  In France, a prohibition  lawwas passed on the  20th July, 1909, and was  to  take effect atthe expiration of the fifth year after promulgation.  It prohibitedthe use of  white  lead  in  any painting  operation of  any kindcarried out by working painters, either on the exterior  or interiorof buildings.   In the other countries referred to regulations werein force.  Notwithstanding the recent examination of the subjects referredto the two Committees, the results of which are briefly outlined above, the  conditions  introduced  by  the war and  since havethrown fresh light on some aspects of the problem, and in some important respects suggested doubt as to the wisdom of applying the remedies recommended by the  Committees  and the need forfurther inquiry.  In particular, in the period  since 1914, their conclusion as  to the value of the substitutes for white lead for external painting the crucial matter was subjected to a specialtest.  &apos; As a result of  the Government control of lead the amount of white lead available for ordinary painting rapidly dwindled tonegligible quantities, and although at the  same time the  volumeof painting done also  declined,  there  was, nevertheless, someopportunity for the  substitutes to  prove  their value.&apos;   When inthe early part of 1921, the  International Labour Office  placed the subject, The Prohibition  of the Use of White Lead in Paint-ing, on the Agenda for the  April! International  Labour Con-ference, it was soon apparent that in this country very  adverseopinions had  been  formed of the  substitutes in many quarters    *  Cmd. 631.-See footnote, p. 4.    t  The subject was, eventually, dealt with at the October  Conference.41653
partly  as  a result of the war experience.   Controversy  on thesubject, and particularly about the House Painting Committee&apos;srecommendations, was renewed.  Another question also came into prominence.  The committees of 1911  had  received  some evidence  concerning the  physio-logical  effects of paint thinners turpentine  and turpentine sub-stitutes and in view of the possibility that a fuller examinationmight  show it to be desirable to call for preventive measures, theHouse  Painting Committee recommended the  adoption of suchlegal steps  as would enable these measures  to be  put intooperation.  It was  now asserted that the lead  constituents inpaint were not the only cause of the ill-health among painters,and that much of the trouble ascribed  to lead was, in fact, due.to turpentine and other paint thinners.  Doubt was thus  thrown on the  statistics of lead poisoning among painters.  On these two main grounds the conclusions of the committees were clearly the  subjects of  considerable  criticism.  The Officeof V/orks also reported that  its  view as to the efficiency  of thesubstitutes had undergone  a  change in the  light of  further ex-perience  and that the  present  Director of  Works was  not inagreement with the  views of his predecessor-  This  Committeewas therefore appointed to review the whole matter.  Before  our  labours  were effectively begun the Third  Inter-national Labour Conference had agreed to the Draft  convention concerning the  use  of white lead  in  painting.   Much  of theground having been covered by the discussions  at Geneva our.work was in the main concerned with the following :     (1) to consider carefully  the danger of lead and  other paint           constituents to the painter ;    (2) to bring the  knowledge gained by experience  in this           country with lead and leadless paints respectively up           to  date, and to review  the position  at the  present           time;    (3) to advise the Government in regard to the future paint-           ing of its own buildings.    (4) to review the conclusions  and recommendations of the           previous Committees.   We  have endeavoured to  present the various aspects  of thesubject in such a way as, where possible, to give the necessarycontinuity to  the work of the former  Committees.PBOGEESS MADE SINCE THE WAP IN THE  CONTEOL           OP THE USB OF  LEAD IN PAINTS.   Two important developments, which particularly  concern thepainting trades, have taken place since the war, viz. :      (1) the adoption  at  the First International Labour Con-           ference,  Washington,  1919,  of  a  recommendation
          concerning the protection  of  women  and  children          against lead poisoning, leading in this country to the          passing of the Women and Young Persons (Employ-          ment in Lead Processes) Act, 1920,* which came into          force on the 1st of January, 1921;    (2) the  adoption  at  the  Third International Labour  Con-          ference, Geneva,  1921, of  the  Draft Convention  on          the Prohibition of the Use of White Lead in Painting.  (1)  Women and Young Persons (Employment in Lead Pro-cesses) Act,  1920. Section 2 of-this Act imposes regulations inregard to  the  employment of women  and young persons under18 years  of age in  any process involving   the  use  of leadcompound &apos;&apos; if the process is such that  dust  or fume from a lead  compound is  produced  therein  or  the persons employedtherein are liable to be splashed  with a  lead compound.&quot;  Alltrades are subject to the Act, not merely those  which are carriedon in a factory or workshop.  As in this country women are not employed  in most branches of painting work the main  effect ofthe Act in the  painting trades is its regulation of the employmentof apprentices and other lads under 18 years of age.  The regulations imposed by Section 2 are as  follows :     (a) Where dust or fume from a lead compound is produced          in  the process, provision must be made for  drawing          the fume or dust  away from the persons employed by          means of an efficient- exhaust draught so contrived as          to operate on the dust or fume as nearly  as may be          at its point of origin.    (b) The persons employed  must undergo  the  prescribed          medical examination at the prescribed intervals, and          the prescribed record  must be kept with respect to          their health.    (c) No  food,  drink, or  tobacco shall   be  brought  into          or  consumed  in  any  room in which the process  is          carried on, and no person, shall be allowed to remain          in any such room during meal times.     (d) Adequate protective clothing  in  a clean condition shall          be provided by the employer and worn by the persons          employed.&apos;     (e) Such suitable cloakroom, messroom and washing accom-          modation as  may  be prescribed shall be provided for          the use of the persons employed.     (/) The rooms in which the persons are  employed, and all          tools  and apparatus used by them, shall be kept in  a          clean condition.* [10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. Oh. 62.]
   All these regulations are now operative as regards the employ- ment of women and young persons on painting work carried on in  factories and workshops.  In  other painting work,  e.g., in house painting, clauses (a) to (d)  and (/) apply.   The only matters to which we need refer in detail are those covered by (a), (6), (d) and  (e).  The effect of (a) in the house painting trade seems to be to prohibit the employment  of  lads under 18 in dry rubbing down processes where lead  paint is used, since, as  already stated, there is  no known method of applying an efficient exhaust draught to  this process-  The requirements contained in (b) concerning the prescribed medical examinations and health records are defined by an Order* of the Secretary of State,  dated  8th November,  1921.    This Order requires the  examinations to be made every  three months by  the  Certifying Surgeon for  the district appointed under the Factory Acts.   Such worker  must be furnished by  his employer with a health  register  in the approved form for the Surgeons- entries of the  dates and results of his  examinations.  The Certi- fying Surgeon may, in his discretion,  suspend from employment in processes involving the use of lead compounds any woman or young  person  on the ground that continuance would involve special danger to health.  Clause (d) makes the employer responsible  for  the provision of clean overalls for the women  and young persons.  For the purposes of clause (e) a further Order t of  the Secretary of State, dated 8th November,  1921,  prescribes  the  cloakroom,, messroom and  washing accommodation to be provided for these persons  in the  factories and  workshops  concerned.  This Order- does not apply to house painting,  but applies to coach painting, the painting of ships in shipbuilding yards and other factory  and workshop painting  processes.   The effect of the  parts of  this- Order which deal with messroom and washing accommodation is to define and  strengthen  the  requirements of Section 75 of  the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, in these works.  Section 4 makes compulsory the notification  of all cases ofindustrial lead poisoning contracted by women and young personsin processes involving the use of  lead compounds.  The definition of &quot; lead compound  &quot;  for the purposes of theAct is contained in  a further Order,* dated 8th November, 1921. Its effect is to treat,  as leadless,  all compounds or mixtures in which the lead compound estimated in the prescribed manner doesnot exceed five per  cent.  The factory inspectors are empowered by the Act to take samples for analysis of the materials in use or intended for use if  they suspect the presence of  lead compound therein.* Statutory Rules and Orders, 1921, No. 1714.f Statutory Rules and Orders, 1921, No. 1715.% Statutory Rules and Orders, 1921, No. 1713.
   (2)  The  Geneva  Convention. The  draft  Convention,  as adopted at the  last session of the Conference, 19th November, 1921,  is given  as Appendix II.  It  proposes the prohibition of the use of white  lead  and sulphate  of  lead  for  the  internal painting of all ordinary  buildings, and the imposition of regula- tions to govern their use otherwise.   The scope of the regulations contemplated for this purpose is indicated in Article 5.   Under the  terms of the Treaty of Peace the Government, in common  with the other Members of the  League of Nations, is rquired within  18 months  of  the adoption of the Convention, i.e., on or before the 19th May, 1923, to bring it forward so that the question  of its ratification or otherwise may be  decided. DANGER PEOM  THE   USE OF LEAD  PAINTS  TO    WORKERS IN  THE  PAINTING TRADES, AND THE   - EFFECT  ON THE  HEALTH  OF  THE  WORKERS    OF PAINTS  CONTAINING  LEAD, AND  LEADLESS    PAINTS  RESPECTIVELY.          LEAD POISONING IN THE PAINTING TRADES.  The extent  of lead poisoning among painters is discussed in the Reports of the previous  Committees, the latest figures given for house painters and coach painters being those for 1913.  The corre- sponding totals for the succeeding years,  to  1921  inclusive, are given  in the table below, which, in addition to the notified cases in house painting and coach  building, gives the totals for the same period in shipbuilding and in the use of paints in other industries.  In  1913  the  cases of lead poisoning among house  painters brought to the knowledge of the Factory Department reached theirhighest point.   The table shows how they began to fail  in 1914. Prom an  early date in the war lead was controlled with, as  a result, great  diminution in the  supply of lead&apos; paints.  This explains the rapid fall in the number of cases which occurred in the years 1914-1918.    Although lead paints are again used in considerable amount, a low  total still persists, which may be due to insufficient accumulation  of lead as yet in the system  of those who have taken up the trade since the war.  The recorded deathsamong . house  painters,  however, (as indicated by the raised figures), of which information is - received  from  the  District Registrars,  have not decreased proportionately to the cases. This was to be expected, seeing that the deaths are  evidence of chronic lead poisoning  of painters who had retired or  taken up other employment when no work in painting was open to them.  Similar  variation is  shown,  in the figures  for the  other industries  dealt  with,  particularly as  regards  coach building.In the case of shipbuilding, however, the drop was not marked till the war was  nearly over; the  small total for 1921 is doubtlessaccounted for by the decline in shipbuilding which had then set in
This trade is  taken as a whole  for the purposes of these lead poisoning returns so that the cases are not necessarily confined topainters.NOTIFIED CASES OF LEAD POISONING AMONG PAINTERS IN THE              PAINTING TRADES :  1910-1921.*Year.

(a) From the number of notifications and of death certificates received in the year.  This, however, does not represent the total incidence,         since notification is not obligatory in the case of house painters.    (4) On the assumption that in house painters the &quot;deaths from lead poisoning &quot; bear the same relation to the &apos;&apos; cases of lead poisoning &quot;         as the corresponding totals do in the lead workersin the combined factory industries,   This relation  is. known for the lead workers         in the combined factory industries, and the &quot; deaths from lead poisoning &quot; among house painters are known from the copies of the         death certificates received from the District Registrars..-        . &apos; &quot;  &quot;                &quot;OO
  It has been  asserted that some of the  cases  attributed to lead poisoning  have actually  been  due to the  turpentine inthe paint; and further,  that  there has been insufficient material to judge of the correctness of the diagnosis of plumbism, particu-larly as regards house  painters.   The  statutory obligation on medical practitioners under Section 73 of the Factory and Work-shop Act, 1901, to notify lead poisoning contracted in a factoryor workshop  does not apply  to  the cases  among house painters,who,-as such, are outside the province of the Factory Act.  a detailed  statement, therefore, as to the  value  of the figures of lead poisoning  among house painters which have come  to theknowledge of the Factory Department should be given.  The   duty, required  of medical  practitioners  to notify  lead poisoning contracted in  a factory  or workshop  dates from theFactory  and  Workshop  Act of  1895.   There  is  no power toallow the fee for  notification in respect of cases not included withinthe terms of the present Act.  Perhaps the most  typical instance in which the relation to  factory or workshop employment  maybe in doubt is that of house painters, but if a house painter spendssome portion of his  time in  a factory or workshop occupied byhis employer in processes such as mixing lead paints, the case may become reportable;  and every  notification is  accepted on theassumption that the practitioner believed that  the painter  was employed in  industry  under conditions  in  which  risk of   lead poisoning might be  anticipated.  Since, however,  the object of notification is to give the Factory Inspectors a clue as to dangerousconditions over which they can exercise control, and their powers in this  respect  are  limited to factory and workshop premises,inquiry into house painting operations has not been made a matterof routine inquiry.  When a case  of lead poisoning in a  factory  or  workshop isnotified, a report is made by the Certifying Factory  Surgeon,who sees both  the  patient and the  place  at  which he  works.During the five  years 1910-1914,  1,079  cases  were notified^of house painters, and,  fortunately, in as many as 262 cases (24&apos;3 percent.) the Certifying Surgeon reported as to symptoms, duration of employment,  severity, age, and so on, in precisely the same way as in factory cases. &apos; This circumstance arose from the fact  thatthe section does not require the medical practitioner to say in what factory the patient  was employed, and it was only by re-ferring  individual cases for inquiry by the Certifying Surgeon that information as  to the  house painting occupation was obtained.These 262 cases are, therefore, strictly comparable with the  2742cases which occurred in factories and  workshops during the  samefive years.   An analysis of these totals has been prepared in  the form of a table  (Appendix  III)  in which comparison  is made  of the severity  of   the  symptoms,   the  number   of   attack,   themain symptoms, the  number  of  cases  excluded  as  &quot; wrong
diagnosis&quot;  and  the  number  of  doubtful  cases  included.These  figures support the  conclusion&apos; that  lead poisoning, isthe chief professional risk of painters, and that the symptoms ofthe cases investigated were more severe than in those  contractedin a factory or workshop.   Thus, the number  of  severe  casesamong house painters is 29&apos;0  per  cent,  as compared with 18&apos; per cent,  among  the males in the factory cases.  The numberreported as suffering from chronic  plumbism was 34&apos;0 per  cent.among house painters, as compared with 10&apos;2 per cent,  among themales in the factory cases.  Perhaps the strongest proof,  how-ever,  is obtained from  the number  recorded  as suffering  fromparalysis.   Wrist drop (paralysis of the extensor muscles of thewrist) is the one  unequivocal sign of lead poisoning, and amonghouse painters the number so suffering was 17&apos;6 per cent. &apos;as corn-pared with 13&apos;6 per cent, among the males in the factory  cases.If poisoning among painters were due to the effect of turpentineand not of compounds of lead, this significant correlation  wouldnot be  shown, as wrist  drop  among1 painters  would not  occurat all.   A similar table,  for  the factory  and  workshop cases which occurred  in  the 10 years  1900-1909,  is included among the appendices to the previous Committees&apos;  reports.   (Appendix II,Cmd. 631.)  Comparison  of the two  tables  shows that in thefactory and workshop industries the severe cases among the  maleshave fallen from 28&apos;2 to 18&apos;4 per cent, of the totals.  Wrist dropmoreover has fallen from 21&apos;1 to 13&apos;6 per cent,  among the samecases.   Such results must be attributed  to the beneficial  effectof  regulations  which  have been applied to  several  of  these industries but not to the painting trades.   As to the allegation which has also  been made that cases amonghouse painters are not verified, it must be remembered that  inlead poisoning diagnosis for the practitioner  offers difficultieswhich do not trouble him in the notification of infectious diseases.There is no standard as to what constitutes  lead poisoning, and every medical practitioner must form his own criterion.  As a rule,  a notification  means that a workman has consulted  hismedical attendant for symptoms due  to lead necessitating absence from work.   Appendix III shows  that  of  the cases  of  housepainters reported on by the Certifying Surgeon only&apos;4&apos;2 per centwere excluded as &quot; wrong diagnosis,&quot; and 3&apos;1 per cent, included although doubtful, as  compared  with 141  and  8&apos;0  per cent.respectively for  the factory cases.  One reason  why  the factorycases show a larger proportion is that the  section  of  the Actrequires an occupier, in addition to  the medical practitioner, toreport  every  case to  the District Inspector  and  Certifying Surgeon,  and  as a  layman  his mistakes  are numerous.    A decorating firm, being  outside the  Factory Act, hardly ever notifies one of its workmen.   Eepresentatives of decorating firms, who gave evidence  before the Committee,  pleaded ignorance of lead poisoning among their
own painters.  A few knew of one case rarely of more.  Wethink this may be accounted for by the fact  that in the 1,079cases notified during the five years 1910 to 1914, no less than 976building  or  decorating   firms  throughout  the  country  were involved.  From only 55  of these firms has more than one  case beenreported.* The cases were distributed  as follows : South Eastern Counties       .....:     477South Western Counties      .......     144Midland Counties     .........     166North  Eastern Counties      ...     ...      89North  Western  Counties     ......     171Scotland and Ireland   ...     ......      32  Every reported  case, it should be remembered,  points to thefact  that  others are suffering from the  effects of lead in  a less degree.  The  average  age of painters at the time of  the attack was  39 years,  and the  duration of employment 18 years.  Similarly, the 782 factory cases  attributed to coach building,shipbuilding, and  &quot; paints used in other industries,&quot; for the fiveyears 1910 to  1914, all of which were reported  on by CertifyingSurgeons, show agreement, in all respects, with what has been said  of the cases among house painters, namely, that the principaloccupational risk run  when using paint is  from lead poisoning.Of the 386 cases  in coach painting, the possibility of effect  ofturpentine rather  than of lead  could not be excluded in 9, thesame is true of 10 of the 153 cases in ship  painting.  reference is not infrequent in reports on cases in ship  painting to the  effectof the  fumes  in  producing  faintness  in  the  confined doublebottoms in which much of the work has to be done.  In 1912 oneinteresting case in a ship painter  was reported which could  bereferred to turpentine.   In this case there were symptoms necessi-tating treatment  in hospital for hsematuria, but none of lead poisoning.  THE  EFFECTS OF TURPENTINE AND TURPENTINE SUBSTITUTES.               (i) Medical  and  Other Evidence.  Apart from lead compounds the only constituents of paint towhich harmful results can  now be specifically ascribed are  thevolatile thinning  agents, viz.,  turpentine  and its substitutes.Reliable experiments  have  conclusively shown that lead  paintsdo not in drying give off emanations which contain lead, andharmful effects to  painters do not result from the oil media.  Thethinning  agents are, however, essentially volatile bodies and  allpainters,  whether using lead or leadless paints, are necessarilybound to inhale their vapours  in  greater  or less concentrationaccording  to  circumstances.  In view of the statements  which  * One firm, however, had 14 oases, a second 9, a third  7, a  fourth 6, and a fifth  5.  Three have had 4  cases, eleven 3 and thirty-six 2.
liave been made in various ^quarters as to  the serious nature of the physiological effects  produced by such inhalation, we have examined carefully the nature  of  the evidence which has beenadduced in support of these statements. We have received further-evidence from  Sir  Kenneth  Goadby, who during a  number ofyears has made laboratory research into the nature of the effects of thinners by  experiments upon animals.   His earlier experi-ments  are described in his evidence before  the  previous  Com-mittees and in Appendix XXI,  Cmd. 681.  His deductions fromhis researches have been widely quoted,  and have probably beenthe greatest factor in causing these statements to be made.  The  evidence which he gave before us was to the following-effect:       (i) That  the different  paint  thinners  in use turpentine,          white, spirit,  benzol, and others are all  dangerous,          some even more so than turpentine.       (ii) That the use of these bodies constitutes a very serious          risk  to painters.     &apos;(iii) That the symptoms produced  by them are abdominal          pain,  cojic,  anaemia, and  headache.   The ansemia          affects  both,  the number of  red  cells  and  their          hemoglobin.     -(iv) That  such symptoms, bearing much resemblance  to           those produced by  acute lead-poisoning,  may  result           from the inhalation  of turpentine vapour when inlcon-           siderable concentration, and in surroundings  pre-           cluding free ventilation.  He referred  to the case of a          painter  affected when working  inside a tank  during          re-painting  operations at the Tower Bridge.       (v) That the definite attribution of such symptoms to lead          on the one hand, to turpentine on the other, was  a           difficult matter,  and could not  as yet be  made with           certainty.     -( vi ) ) That he (witness)  had met with cases presenting such           symptoms among painters who  were using a paint           free from lead, and  had not been  using lead paint for    ..      some time previously.     (vii) That even anaemia which, when due to lead, arises only           when considerable quantities of lead have  entered the           system may occur as a result of turpentine, and  in the           absence of lead.     -(viii) That animal experiments with inhalations of turpen-           tine  in considerable  concentration had given clear           proof of kidney-changes produced by  the  turpentine,           and that these changes might progress to the degree           of chronic Bright&apos;s  disease.    But he allowed that           in  the case  of  animals  which had  not  died  of
          acute turpentine  poisoning, but which had been sub-          sequently killed,  he had no  evidence to  offer  as  to          disease of the kidneys or changes in the urine.     (ix)  That he had no clinical evidence of chronic turpentine          poisoning in man.  His observations included  only          acute cases.  There  was no  evidence  to  show. that          these sufferings had continued for any length of  time          or that  they had led to permanent structural disease.      (x)  That investigations upon which he was  still engaged          indicated that for the  same  age groups  the  blood          pressure of  a painter tended to be high,  whereas that          of workers in another lead industry where turpentine          was not used, i.e., white lead manufacture, it tended          to be low.  This was the case where the  painters were          employed on leadless paints and had so been, for some          time.  The  witness had discussed  this matter  in  a          paper* to which  he referred.   [It is to be remarked          that, up to  the present,  the number of painters          examined  for  this purpose is too small  to enable          reliable deductions to be drawn.]  As  regards  chronic  effects in man due to  the  thinners, SirKenneth Goadby sought to show, from the occupational mortalitystatistics compiled by  the Registrar-General for the years 1910-1912 and 1900-1902,  that  the painter suffers in  a  remarkabledegree from incidence of Bright&apos;s disease as compared with the lead manufacturer.!   The  comparative mortality  figure  (1900-1902) for lead  manufacturers was given as 103 for plumbism, and149 for Bright&apos;s disease, whereas for painters and  plumbers, thefigures were 23 for plumbism, and 69 for Bright&apos;s disease.  Heinsisted that the ratio  these two diseases bear is quite different inthe two  cases, and   in this he  claimed to  find confirmation of his  laboratory experiments^on  animals,  viz.,  that inhalationof turpentine  was a factor in the production of bright&apos;s disease.He alluded to the difficulty he  had found  in  regard to. thecomparability  of the  Registrar-General&apos;s figures  from decade  todecade.   Finally, he expressed  himself  as satisfied  that the clinical,practical, experimental and statistical evidence all converged  to throw suspicion upon -the paint thinners as  an active cause ofBrighfs disease in painters.  He  stated that  in his opinion thematter needed further investigation and that if this corroboratedhis views the question of  paint  thinners  ought to be made a subject of regulation or warning or perhaps legislation.   Subsequently, we had the advantage  of the evidence of Dr..T! H. C.  Stevenson, of  the  Registrar-General&apos;s  Office,  who  * &quot;Immunity and Industrial Disease,&quot;   Journal of  the Royal Society ofArts, 1st July, 1921.  No. 3580.

 * Although the figures are available in the Eegistrar-GeneraFs Office, thedecennial  supplement on Occupational  Mortality  Statistics for  the. years1910-1912 has not been published. % Dr. Stevenson&apos;s tables. corrected   misunderstandings  of  the  occupational  mortality statistics into which Sir Kenneth Goadby had fallenl, doubtless as i result  of using  unpublished  statistics  unaccompanied  by explanatory comment..*  Dr. Stevenson  explained that, although the standard population to which the age group death rates for the various occupations  dealt with are  referred for purposes of comparison formerly varied from decade to decade,  the returns for 1890-1892 and  for 1910-1912 have been recalculated on the basis of the standard population for 1901, so that now  three sets of mortality rates, all based upon the  same standard population, are available for comparison at intervals of  ten years, viz.,  those for 1890-1892, 1900-1902, and 1910-1912.  Dr.  Stevenson  has  furnished  tables  of the deaths  in  the standard population and the comparative  mortality figures for (1)  occupied males; (2) painter, plumber, glazier; (3) lead manu- facturer, leaden goods makers;  (4) potters; (5)  file makers the most important lead risk occupations.  His  main&apos; objection to Sir Kenneth Goadby&apos;s argument was  that  in  consequence of  their small  numbers the  mortality ratio of bright&apos;s disease  to,lead poisoning for lead manufacturers is so unstable as to be worthless. For painters and plumbers, whose numbers are large, Table 2J shows that this ratio has been fairly stable, but for lead manufac- turers, who are under 2,000 in number, it  has fluctuated to such an extent that quite different conclusions would be reached  according to the period selected for comparison.  In the two periods  1890- 1892 add 1910-1912 the mortality for these workers ascribed to bright&apos;s disease was much less  than  half that ascribed to lead poisoning,  whereas in the period&apos; 1900-1902 it was  50  per  cent. greater (Table 3).$  But though if either of these periods had been chosen; instead of 1900-1902 the  argument as stated  would have been  muoh more  striking, it  loses  its force  in  view of  the instability of one of the two ratios compared and of the experience recorded for other occupations exposed to lead risk.   The number of file makers (Table 5)  is much larger  than that of lead manu- facturers,  yet their mortality ratio of bright&apos;s disease  to lead poisoning has increased from just over equality in the period  1890- 1892 to more  than 15  to 1 in the  period 1910-1912.   It is evidently impossible to draw any conclusions from ratios founded on the very small numbers of deaths compared in these cases,and therefore the whole argument  appears to  fail.    The 3 :1 ratio for painters may quite as  fairly  be compared. with that of 15 :1  for file makers,  who are not exposed  to turpentine risk, as with  the 15 :10 ratio quoted for lead  manufacturers.  To put the matter in another way the deaths in the standard population from lead  poisoning and  from  bright&apos;s disease  in
1900-1902  and 1910-1912 compare as follows for lead manufaturers-turers (Table 8)*  and file makers  (Table 5)* respectively : -	Lead Manufacturers.		File Makers.

Lead Poisoning.	bright&apos;s Disease1-1900 2 ......... 1910-12... .........	102 123	initio 56	56 10	134 154  For lead manufacturers the proportion of mortality ascribed to lead poisoning  per cent,  of that  ascribed  to Bright&apos;s  diseaseincreased from 64  per cent. (102/160) to 220 per cent.  (123/56)while  in  the  same periods the  same  proportion  for file makersdecreased from  42 per cent. (56/134)  to  7  per cent.  (10/154).No  conclusions  can  legitimately  be drawn  from  ratios  sofluctuating as these.  Further, Dr.  Stevenson also  pointed out that the comparison between two industries in the way made by Sir Kenneth Goadbyshould only be  made with the  figures whioh are in excess over those  for the entire population.  The bright&apos;s disease rate forthe whole population! for  the 1900-02  return was 32.  It is onlythe excess over  this which can fairly be ascribed to  the industrial conditions.   Viewed in this  light the comparison.of  the figuresused  by  Sir Kenneth Goadby stands as follows : .                                                   bright&apos;s                                        Lead       Disease                                      Poisoning.    (excess).       Painters, Plumbers and Glaziers   23           37       Lead  Manufacturers   ...    ...   103          117  It is clear, therefore, that the mortality statistics do not warrant the  suggestion that turpentine is the  cause of a large proportionof the excess bright&apos;s disease among  painters.   Dr. Stevenson has failed to find in the returns of the last tenyears a single certificate in which the  cause of death was assigned to turpentine poisoning.  The non-medical witnesses who referred to the matter of tur-pentine  effects  could only  speak from the standpoint of their general  observations,  and it was  clear that their actual know-ledge was  confined  to   the acute  effects already  mentioned.Ample evidence  exists that  acute  attacks  of greater or lesserseverity, due to fumes from  the  thinners in  paint, occur whenpaints, particularly quick-drying paints, are applied in confined  * Dr. Stevenson&apos;s tables.  f The figures given here are  based on returns of deaths and populationsinclusive of the figures for persons recorded as retired from the occupations, a method first introduced for the period 1900-1902.   The  figures used by SirKenneth Goadby for lead manufacturers for this period, viz., 103 for lead poisoning and 149 for bright&apos;s disease, are for occupied workers only.
or  badly-ventilated places.    Sir Frank Baines  spoke- of three-painters employed under the Office of Works who were attacked in 1921-  They were painting under a big cornice in hot weather.Dr. R. S. Morrell, the chief chemist at Messrs. Mander Brothers,.a leading firm of varnish and paint makers, repudiated the sug7oestion  that the men  of his firm who are subject to turpentine-fumes had suffered therefrom, but these  men are not painters. Professor Armstrong, however, shared Sir Kenneth.Goadby&apos;view  as to the likelihood of permanent effects being produced.. In  evidence  given  before us, medical and scientific witnesseshave  sought to  strengthen  their case as to the possible injuriousnature of turpentine and other paint thiimers by reference to theeffects of the toxic fumes  given off in  the doping of aeroplanewings  by  tetrachlorethane,  until  it  was given  up  in 1916.Tetrachlorethane is a very poisonous substance which was  used as  a  solvent of  acetate of cellulose  (not  as  a thinner)  to theextent of about 13 per cent,  of the dope.  The symptoms  were quite definite, the substance having a specific effect on the liver-cells, and  did  noti resemble  in the least those  attributed to-turpentine  and other  thinners, so that  any analogy  falls to theground. The Annual Reports of the Chief Inspector of  Factories giveparticulars   of   severe  inhalation   cases,  including  fatalitiesarising  from the use of quick-drying paints on shipboard.   Such-acute attacks as the latter are, strictly speaking, of the natureof gassing accidents.   The  non-fatal attacks, although individual cases may at the time be serious, appear to lead to no permanentillness. The cases caused by quick-drying paints on shipboard appear-to have been due to concentration of the fumes given  off by  some-very  volatile material, e.g., benzol or an organic chlorine  corn-pound,  and not by turpentine.   The need  for special ventilatingarrangements  for  internal  painting  on  shipboard  must  be emphasised.    The house painter and the  men  employed oncoaches and other vehicles will, under ordinary  circumstances,.not be  subject  to  similar  conditions.  Some makers of quick-drying  paints print cautionary words on the  labels for their pro-ducts, showing  the necessity for adequate ventilation where suchpaints are used.  The  statistical information  available  for  out  consideration,therefore, tended to show  that turpentine as a serious agent inthe production of chronic painter&apos;s illness was not to be compared&apos;with  white  lead and the other lead compounds used in paint.           (ii)  Information from Industrial  Circles,  The  Committee have felt that, if there is  any foundation forthe suggestion that turpentine is responsible for any considerable proportion of the poisoning from which painters  suffer, evidenceof its toxic effects ought to be available in works where turpen-tine  is used  but no lead.   They have  therefore  instituted&apos;
enquiries  in  works of this kind.   Some striking  evidence was first obtained  from the records of absenteeism among the largestaff of painters at a railway wagon works where the use of leadhad been given up for  many years   Careful records had  been kept, but these contained no evidence whatever to show thatthe men had  been  seriously affected by the use of  turpentine.  Further enquiries were undertaken  by the Secretary  and theresults are summarised in some detail in Appendix IV.  Theseagain did not provide any evidence that workers exposed to thefumes of turpentine,  white spirit, and the other volatile bodies which are used so largely in paints and varnishes, are subject tochronic effects therefrom.   A few  persons  are found, unable totolerate turpentine  fumes at all.  It must be understood that the value  of the information given inthe summary is purely  relative and not to be exaggerated forobvious reasons.   There was  little  to  be gathered, for instance,about the nature of the  illnesses among retired workers, an im-portant factor in the  matter under consideration.  The information was gleaned partly  from the painting trades,and partly from those other trades where some exposure to suchfumes might  be expected, e.g., paint, enamel-and varnish fac-tories, polish and cleaning cream factories, spirit distillation works,oil  extraction mills.  In order to eliminate the effect of the leadelement the paint-using  firms visited  were mainly those whichwere understood to have been working with leadless paints forsome time.    The painting  and  varnishing trade is the onlyimportant one available for a study of the turpentine problem.  . As to the causes of  deaths among painters, other than a generalknowledge  of the  occurrence here  and  there of fatal  cases  ofplumbism, nothing is known in industrial circles of special interestcalling for notice.   In one or two of the large  works visited absentee records wereavailable,  but  these  again provided no evidence  of turpentinepoisoning.  A case  in  point is  that  of  the London  CountyCouncil&apos;s  large  tramway   repair  depot  where  about   135painters  are   employed.    Only   leadless  paints   are  used,with  the  exception  of  a  small  amount  of lead  chromatefor colour purposes.   Mr. A. L.  C. Fell,  the General  Managerof  the  CounciTs  Tramway  Department,  was  a  member  ofthe 1911 Coach Painting Committee.   He has, therefore,  been fully alive  to the  allegations concerning the  harmful effects of paint thinners.  He  has not in the period  since then heard any- tbing which  points  to  turpentine poisoning resulting from the conditions under which  coach painting, is carried on.  A system-exists under  the Council  of  submitting all matters of industrial interest which bear on the health of the Councils workers, e.g., suspected or obscure illnesses due  to materials handled, to Sir John Collie for his consideration from the medical point  of View, but no such cases have arisen in connection with leadless paint materials.
  Mi&apos;- Reid, the Superintendent of the&apos; Midland Railway&apos;s Car- riage and Wagon Works,  Derby, where over  300 painters&apos;are employed, furnished comparative tables of lost time for three con- seeutive  years for three, of  the departments under his charge, including the painters.   This record shows that the  time  lost in the painting shop is practically the same as that in the carriage building  and repairing shops  At  this works leadless paints are alone used.                       (iii) Conclusion.  Having carefully examined the available evidence we conclude that there is not sufficient ground to warrant us in accepting the view that   turpentine  poisoning  is  the cause  of the leading symptoms commonly attributed to either acute or chronic lead poisoning, nor in  attributing to the inhalation  of the fumes of turpentine and other thinners the occurrence of  chronic bright&apos;s disease.                   BASIC LEAD SULPHATE.  Basic lead sulphate is manufactured in this country for use as a white  base.  As  such it  is  used both  here  and  to  a still greater extent in America.   In many quarters it is assumed to be non-poisonous.   The  manufacturers of this substance object to its being classed  along  with ordinary  white  lead (basic lead carbonate) and claim for it that it is much less poisonous and therefore should not  be subject to the same restrictions.  Whilst  there  is some  justification  for  this  contention  it is, nevertheless, a very poisonous  substance.   If we represent  the. average composition  of commercial basic lead sulphate as PbSCv PbO, it is evident that half of its lead content is in the form of lead oxide which would  be  soluble in  dilute  hydrochloric acid of the  strength  specified   in  the  Home  Office  test  for pottery glazes (see p.  33).   The results  of  a series of careful tests made- in the prescribed manner, which were brought as evidence beforens,  showed   that  the  House  Painting   Committee*  under- estimated the amount  of soluble  lead  in  basic  lead sulphate- paint, so that instead of 20 per cent, of this substance  beingallowable on a basis of 5 per cent, soluble lead,  as  they reported, not more than 8 to  9 per cent, could in fact be allowed.  This. agrees well  with what theory indicates as a maximum, namely 10 per cent.  On the other hand normal lead sulphate,  PbSO*, is relatively non-poisonous, as it is so sparingly soluble both in water and indilute hydrochloric acid  containing  0&apos;25 per  cent.  HC1  (the- strength  specified  in the Home  Office  test) that&apos; it may  beregarded  as an insoluble and a non-poisonous compound.* See Cd. 7882, p. 102.
&apos;  * See Experimental  Work by Sir Kenneth G-oadby, described to previous-Committees ; Appendix XXI, Cmd. 631, and Q. 15,761, et seq. Omd. 632.      LEADLESS  BASES, EXTENDERS,  DRIERS, COLOURS.  We have no evidence to show  that  leadless paint bases,  ex-tenders, driers, or colours produce,  under the  conditions apper-taining to  painting,  constitutional effects  comparable with thosedue  to  lead.   This is true both of dust produced in rubbingdown,  and  leadless  material  suspended  in  oil.  . Althoughlaboratory   experiments   on  animals  have  proved  that  theinhalation  of dust of zinc oxide produces  harmful effects,* these-effects do not appear to be reproduced under industrial conditions.Mr.  Clive Cookson, whose firm manufacture both white lead andantimony oxide for  paint purposes, regards the antimony base,;apart from the dermatitis which it sometimes produces,  as in-dustrially non-poisonous, and the experience of the  Factory De-partment so far supports this view.  As  regards the new paintbase, titanium dioxide, no information  is available yet to indicateits physiological effects.OAUSATION OF LEAD  POISONING  AMONG PAINTEKS.                 DUST OF LEAD COMPOUNDS.  The view that lead poisoning among painters is almost entirely-caused by dust is now generally admitted.  Dry sandpapering of either old or new paint work and, in a less degree, the chipping or scraping of old paint give rise  to by far the greatest amount of dust.  Dry lead compound is still used tosome extent by the  painter for paint mixing purposes, but so faras white lead or sulphate of lead is concerned, this is unnecessary,as all such use of dry material should  be confined to the  paint-mixing factories, where the danger can be adequately controlled.The remaining risks from dust of such compounds, i.e., from driedpaint splashes on person and clothing, can be minimised only bythe necessary provision for, and practice  of, personal hygiene.  Wehave been  glad  to hear that the need for the latter is becoming more and  more recognised by the workers.  This  is evidencedby the clauses relating to the provision  of washing facilities, timeallowance  at the end of the working periods for washing handsbefore meals, messing arrangements, &amp;c, which are to be foundin many of the working  agreements between masters  and menwhich are  now in operation.  If the danger of lead poisoning associated with dry rubbing downis to be met effectively this process must be eliminated.   the remedies /which can be adopted  in factories for most dusty opera-tions, Le., provision of suitable fans and dust trapping and collect-ing  apparatus,  cannot at present  be applied to the  work of thehouse painter. Again, there are objections to the use of respiratorsas they give rise to discomfort if worn for  any length of time, and
  it is, therefore, difficult to persuade the workers to wear thein ;.  also, they are troublesome to keep clean and their use does notrI  therefore, afford sufficient protection.    The difficulty of dealing adequately with the dry rubbing down.I  process, at that time thought to be indispensable for certain work,.1  was one of the main reasons why the House Painting Committee&apos;I considered that a satisfactory code of regulations for painting was.I  impossible.                        , &apos;!-    In the past two years much experimental work has been under-:I  taken in various quarters with a view to determine whether damp-I  or moist rubbing down could be adopted in all  cases where sand-j  papering is necessary.   Quite soon-after our appointment some of  the Members of the  Committee were invited to see  the early trials-I  which were at&quot;first carried out with ordinary sandpaper, but, even  so, had already given  promise of a measure of success.   But the:  rapid wearing away of this material when damped seemed likely&apos;  to prove somewhat of a deterrent to a complete practical success.   Further objections  to such an alteration of  working methods-  put forward by various witnesses were :-    (a) Increase  of Cost. It was  stated that this would  result  from the expenditure  on sponges, the larger quantities of sand-  paper required and through increased time  being  required for  the work.    One witness regarded any extra cost in this way  in respect of tenement property as a very serious matter.    (b) Moulded work. One witness gave it as his opinon that gritj  would be left  in the quirks of  mouldings and  this  would  prove  very troublesome on the application of the subsequent  coats of  paint.    (c) Drying-off after the damping or moistening .-^Tha same wit-  ness referred to the fact that any water left on the paint in the  nibbing down process  would prove troublesome to dry off in many  eases, especially when the weather was damp, and he stated that  unless the water were got rid of there would be trouble with the  paint subsequently  applied.    (d) Present Customs of Trade-.- -The view was  expressed that  the older  workers might not take kindly to  the new  method  if  applied to operations where they are accustomed now to rub down  by the easily applied dry process, though it was admitted that in  the future the apprentices  could be trained in  the new method  from the start and  that moist rubbing down  would thus become  the trade custom.    Recently, however, waterproof sandpaper has been introduced,  which is very durable  under the special conditions appertaining to  damp  rubbing  down.   Several  reports have been, made,  which  confirm its efficiency and which provide convincing evidence that  the damp method can be successfully  adopted.  Opinion has, in  consequence,  undergone considerable change  since the  above  evidence was given, and it is now generally accepted by the trade
(as is evidenced by the draft agreement between the Home Officeand the Painters&apos;  and Decorators&apos;  Industrial Joint Council ofGreat Britain referred to on p. 34 and by a recent statement by the National Federation of Building Employers to the HomeOffice) that dry rubbing down is no longer necessary, and that this work can be done by a damp process.  The Building Trade employers, in  their  communication to theHome Office, pointed out that they could not assent  to the pro-hibition of dry rubbing down unless  an ample  supply of water-proof sandpaper was available.   We feel confident that, with theneed for this material established, the manufacturers concerned will be found prepared to take steps to meet the demand andthat the required supplies  will very soon be placed on the market.  Mr. Klein made determinations of  the total dust in the air andits  lead content in the vicinity  of the workers&apos; mouths.  In his evidence he quoted figures as follows :                         Dust.  Lead.  Dry rubbing  down ...   45&apos;3   5&apos;7 milligrammes per cubic metre.  Moist             ...    2-0   0-1       ,,      ,,        ,,Assuming  that  the  conditions obtaining  during  these  testsrepresent those which normally prevail  under  practical condi-tions, the figures show that by substituting moist for dry rubbingdown the danger from  lead is minimised, the lead content falling,in the newer process,  to  an amount well within the recognisedsafety limit.*  We therefore recommend that dry rubbing down be prohibited.          LIQUID PAINT  CONTAINING  LEAD COMPOUND.  We have to  make but the slightest reference to the risk fromthe splashes of paint which are  scattered by the painter&apos;s brush.Experiments show that the only painting operation  from whichtrouble may be anticipated is that of  overhead stippling, e.g., onceilings.  But  even in such  work the risk cannot be comparedwith that caused by dust.  Paint  spraying appliances are finding  increasing use in thepainting  trades, not  only for the painting of  articles such aswheels,  coach  panels, coach bodies, and the like, but also in building and shipbuilding work  for the covering of large surfaces.The use  of such  machines for  the application  of lead paintrequires consideration.  The painting of the articles mentionedcan be carried  on in connection with a localised exhaust draughtso  applied  that practically  all spray  is drawn away  from the worker.   The  application of lead spray in building and  ship-building is viewed by the workers with some alarm, since the useof  an exhaust  scheme as detailed   above is not practicable at* See Cmd. 630, p. 30.
&apos; present.  Unless exhaust ventilation is locally applied we think that a spray containing lead should not be used for interior work.  In whatever manner lead paint is applied we think  that, in view of the risk from dried splashes on person and clothing, the- regulations in the draft agreement referred to above are necessary to ensure that suitable precautions will be taken. EXPERIENCE  OP  LEAD  AND  LEADLESS  PAINTS-    SINGE   THE   INQUIRIES  OF  THE  PREVIOUS    COMMITTEES, UNDER WAR CONDITIONS.           (i) Analysis of Evidence&apos; of Witnesses.  The  issue of the  Coach  Painting Committee&apos;s report was- delayed till 1920, and the Committee prior to its publication took the  matter of the War-time experience into consideration.  They remark :       &apos;&apos; The experience of various paint materials gained during;    the War does not appear to be of much practical value to our    Committee  for a number  of reasons; in the first place, no-    painting has been done which could possibly be avoided; all    painting  work  which was absolutely  necessary  has  been    carried out with any kinld of material that was available, and&apos;    was  often done  so hurriedly  as to afford no  real test  of    durability;  moreover scarcely any paint work has received    proper care and attention during the War, owing to the lack    of  varnishing facilities and the like.&quot;  (Cmd. 630, p.  42.)  To this may be added the fact that much of the painting work was done by inexperienced workers.  But in the matter  of the reputed superior durability of paints containing white lead over  the zinc oxide substitute,  for the ordinary&apos;external painting of buildings, very  importanit evidence, which cannot we think be regarded from the above standpoint, was given by some of  the witnesses who appeared before us.  The outstanding matter to which we have to refer is the change of view of H.M. Office of Works, as indicated in  the evidence of the  Director  of Works  in! that  Department.   This  witness explained that  the  demands  for economy which became  SO&apos; insistent  when the 1921 Draft Estimates were under considera- tion in  the January of that year compelled him to make a careful enquiry into  the question.  Financial saving was sought by an immediate cutting down of the  normal painting programme, and, by extending the periods between  successive  repaintings, further economies were hoped for in the future.  AH the officials under him who were responsible for  the large maintenance services of the Department then represented to him that they could not alter the  standard materially ini view of the serious depreciation and lack of durability of the zinc base paints in use.   It was, he said,practically a universal opinion on the part of 50 or 60 such officers that zinc  base paints  did not stand externally at all well.  More-over, repainting over zinc base paints had  proved particularly
 position previously: taken up.   Sir  Frank  Jiair.es informed us that  in public buildings  which  are liable to hard  usage  and become very  dirty, such as post offices and county  courts, the frequent washings which  are  absolutely necessary have  a. very rapid action on the zinc paints hitherto used and that in these places lead has proved itself superior to zinc.   He went so far as to appeal for the exemption, of such places from the principle of prohibition  of  lead  for  inside  painting,  if that  principle, embodied as it is in the  Geneva Convention, is applied generally in this country.  For the painting of most  interiors the witnesses were agreed that substitutes, which  at present  are  mainly  zinc  substitutes, are satisfactory.  The  chief exceptions  are places where there is excessive humidity or  hard  wear.   The results  prove  most successful when the work is  enamelled  or the  upper,  coat of paint is treated with varnish.   The Committees of 1911 antici- pated that the use of varnish  would be  necessary  to render the zinc substitutes entirely successful.  It must  be remembered, however,  that a large proportion of painting is not  protected with enamel or varnish.  The Committees considered,  on the evidence which  they heard, that the total cost  of the work would not be materially increased by the  use of  varnish.   But there was no doubt in the minds of the witnesses  who appeared before us that additional expense would be inevitable, if  for no other reason than that  the extra labour costs were&apos;bound to be  considerable, as the application of varnish paints and enamels takes longer.  In regard to the painting of vehicles there seems to have been relatively little  or  no change  in the pre-war position.  For ih- stance,  in  the  Carriage and  Wagon  Department of the MidlandRailway Company&apos;s Works  at Derby, the  use of leadless paints t still  the&apos;rule.  We were  particularly interested to hear  from the chief foreman  painter that the wagons, which are not  var- liished, are  treated  with three coats  (one  priming  and  two finishing)  of a  zinc  oxide base paint  made up almost - entirely with zinc oxide paste and boiled linseed oil, and that  this lastsnormally for four, or even  five  years before repainting.  In orderto make sure  that there was no mistake as to the composition of this paint we caused samples to be taken and these were analysedin the  Government Laboratory.  These analyses confirmed the leadless4 composition as  given by the witness.  The requirementsof a rough railway wagon cannot be fairly  compared with thoseappertaining to house painting, and we have had no evidenceof a paint  of  this composition having  been used  on buildings,but the fact that such a paint  gives the above service in practiceis sufficiently interesting to call for record.* Small percentages of lead sulphate were found in the samples, maximum
               (ii)  Office of Works&apos;  Kew Tests.  The witnesses from the Office of Works were among the numberwho informed the Committees of 1911 that it was  necessary touse lead in the  priming coats for iron and steel work, but they also stated that  experiments with leadless paints,  begun at Kewin 1912, were still in progress.  As the experiments went on forsome  years and  were continued during the war period it is con-venient to refer  to the results here.  On the 6th May, 1919, the Office of Works informed the Home-Office  that  these tests had  shown that several kinds of leadlesspaint  had given satisfactory results (see Appendix iVI) and  that,in consequence,  the Department proposed to extend their leadless-policy to this particular class of work.  The Kew tests have been severely criticised in the controversyof the last two years.   Paint  tests to be of real value and to command general acceptance must take account of every relevantfactor.   Certain fundamental factors were overlooked in  the case-of the  Kew tests.              (iii)  Home Office Inquiries, 1921.  On  receipt of  the questionnaire from the International LabourOffice in  1921 the Home Office took steps to ascertain  how far the use of leadless paints had progressed in this country.  Infor-mation was sought  from Government Departments, from the-more important  English City and County Borough Councils, and.from  certain railway, tramway, and omnibus companies.   the inspectors  of Factories  also  furnished  reports  on  the  same-subject.  A summary of the  replies to the Home Office Inquiry is givenin Appendix VII, which shows that, apart from the  enforced useof the substitutes brought about by  war  conditions, the replace-ment  of  lead paints had made little  progress.   During  the warthe use of leadless substitutes, often of an inferior  character, was almost inevitable and the experience gained was so unsatisfactorythat a return to the use of lead paints, at least  as regards  build-ings, was made as soon  as possible.  The results with  the substitutes  were more  satisfactory  as-regards the painting of the various classes of  vehicles althougheven for  this purpose the view is still held in many quarters thatlead paints are superior.  The reports indicate that  very considerable thought was givenin many  quarters with  the  object of finding  the most suitablepigment  for each particular  job, and for this reason  we desire to-call attention here to a few  opinions expressed in the replies.  (a)  For the severe conditions for paint work obtaining in theNaval Service, due to the effects of sea water, sea ah, oil, repeatedsaturations and  dryings, traffic, hard wear in and out board, &amp;c,no paint is as effective as lead (Admiralty view);
  (fa) White lead is best in the atmospheric conditions of manu-fiicturing cities.  (A view  frequently stated);  (c) White lead is best  for under coatings where there is ex-posure to sea air or sea water ;  (d) Lead paint is best for public baths and washhouses and forboiler houses;  (e) Lead paints  are  quite unsuitable  in  gas works Owing tosulphur fumes .CONCLUSIONS.              PAINTING  OF  BUILDINGS.  Prom a general  review of the  evidence that  has been placed before us, and in  the  light of the experience  gained  since theprevious Committees reported, we feel we cannot  support  the irrecommendation that the use  of lead paint,  for the painting of buildings,  be entirely prohibited.   We are satisfied that for out-side painting, and  for certain kinds of internal painting, there isat present no efficient substitute for lead paint.  At the same time the statistics of lead poisoning, arising  fromlead paint, in  its production and in  its use, are unquestionablysufficiently serious  to make it most desirable to limit its  use as faras practicable,  and, Where it is used, to make its use subject to statutory regulations,  as is  already done in its  production.  We consider that as regards white  lead, sulphate of  lead, andpaint bases which  contain these lead  compounds&apos; these  needs  areadequately met by the agreement readied at  the  Geneva  Con-ference  and subsequently embodied  in the Convention adoptedthere.  We accordingly recommend  that legislation  should  be passed  to  give effect to the principles therein  contained, havingregard  to  the  accurate  definition  of internal  and  externalpainting.  It will  be necessary to defer enforcement of the pro-hibition of the use of white  lead  and sulphate of lead for  theinternal painting of buildings till 1927, as  laid down in the Con-vention, &apos;in order to give sufficient time for the necessary  trademodifications to be introduced,  but  we  think that regulations to deal  with the continued  use  of  lead paint should be broughtinto force at the earliest  possible moment.  We  have to, point  out,  however, that the evidence placed before us  shows that,  at  present, any  prohibition  of  the use of lead  paints for certain purposes  is likely  to involve an increaseof cost.   This  conclusion is  based on. the consideration of  thetotal outlay required to maintain, respectively,  lead and existingleadless paints in  comparable condition over a  reasonable period.of years.
   The prohibition of the use of white lead and basic sulphate of&quot;lead is subject in the Geneva Convention to three exceptions as-follows :                            ...     (1) Eailway Stations and  Industrial Establishments  when-           exempted under specified conditions.     .     (2) A small percentage of  the prohibited compounds  to  be           permitted in white pigments up to a maximum of two-           per cent,  estimated  as metallic lead.     (3) Processes of  Artistic Painting and Pine Lining.   The first two require consideration, because, in. the event of ratification of the Convention as it  stands, certain difficulties may arise in connection with them..  We indicate here&apos;the nature ofthese difficulties.   (1) Railway  Stations:   Industrial   Establishments.&apos; TheGovernment is to be empowered to exempt such  premises afterconsultation  with the employers&apos;,  and workers&apos; organisations ifsatisfied  that white  lead or sulphate of lead is necessary for  theinternal painting of these places.   This  relaxation was includedbecause railway stations and certain classes of industrial premises are normally subject to severe  or  special conditions of exposurefor which, it is generally conceded, white lead proves the mostdurable paint base.8  Cotton mills are a case in point.   Leadless:substitutes which have been used for the internal painting  of  thecotton mills in Lancashire have proved  unsatisfactory from  the standpoint of durability.   The exemptions which may be allowed under this heading arestrictly limited and circumscribed, and we feel that other cases will be found where claims for  exemption may be equally justifi-able.  For  instance the interior paint work in certain classes ofpublic buildings&apos; which are not  industrial establishments becomesvery dirty and frequent washings are necessary,  e.g.,  police  and county courts, post offices and other buildings much frequentedby the  general public.   Under   these  circumstances  leadless:paints up to the present have proved less durable than white lead..   (2)  Small Lead Percentages. In any measure of prohibition-it is impracticable  to  require  the  use of  a  substitute which is;entirely  lead-free.  The Committees of 1911 suggested that  leadcompound should be permitted in  the dry material of the paint, (i.e., the paint material freed from  moisture, turpentine, oil,  var-nish,  size,  etc.),  up to a maximum of  5 per  cent.,  by weight,.estimated as lead monoxide.  The standardised test suggested forthe determination of this percentage was based on the fact  thatthe poisonous lead compounds are soluble in weak hydrochloric&apos; acid.  The  specified strength  of this acid, which for this  reason is used in the  test, is intended to correspond with the normal  acid  * See also Clauses II to IV of the final conclusions of the Report of theNetherlands White Lead Commission ;  Cmd. 631, Appendix XXXtV, p. 58..
strength of the human gastric juices.   The  amount of lead dis-solved from a paint mixture by this means is therefore a measureof its poisonous character.   This test, known as the solubility/test for lead, was originally designed for the classification of the lead glazes used in potteries, those below 5 per cent, solubilitybeing recognised as comparatively free from serious risk.*  TheConvention, however, exempts &quot;white  pigments  containing  amaximum of 2 per cent, of lead expressed in terms of metalliclead.&quot;  This method  of  computing the  lead  content is  clearly not based on a solubility test, but on a gravimetric  estimation ofthe white lead or  sulphate of lead  which may be present in thewhite pigment.  We have  pointed out  elsewhere  that the limit allowed in theSecretary of State&apos;s Order which defines &quot; lead compound &quot; forthe purposes of the Women and Young Persons (Employment inLead Processes) Act,  1920, is 5 per  cent, of lead  estimated aslead monoxide, the  ordinary solubility  test  being  used.   Weshould prefer to see one standard  adopted in connection with allprovisions which define  exemptions for this purpose.  The  word &quot; lead &quot; is used in two senses  in the exemptionclause-,  firstly to signify &quot; white lead &quot; or &quot;  sulphate of lead,&quot;these being the only materials which the Convention is  draftedto control, and secondly &quot; metallic lead.&quot;  Quite apart from thequestion of possible  alteration of  the minimum percentage wethink this somewhat loose wording will require to be expandedin any legislative enactment.  Otherwise difficulties may arise inregard to the use of impure zinc oxides, which often contain comsitlerable percentages of basic lead sulphate.   Presumably theintention of the exemption is; to prohibit the use  of these zincproducts for internal painting if the  lead sulphate expressed interms of metallic lead exceeds 2 per cent.  The recommendation which we make will  ensure that  the intention  to control zincbases which contain lead  is carried out.  The other lead compounds used in paint, viz., red lead, orangelead, lead chromate and litharge, are required for special purposes and, although poisonous  compounds, their  use is much  more restricted than that of white lead, and will call for special and separate regulation.                       REGULATIONS.  If our recommendation  that  the  principles  of the  Geneva Convention be adopted,  Article 6 requires  that the employers&apos; and workers&apos;  organisations  are to be consulted by the  Govern- ment authorities concerned  before they take the steps they may consider necessary to ensure the observance of the Regulations. &apos; See Report o E the Departmental Committee on Lead in  Potteries.

  lii  view of these provisions the Home Office, daring the past year,  have taken preliminary steps, in collaboration with repre-sentatives appointed by the Painters&apos; and Decorators&apos;  IndustrialJoint Council of Great Britain, in the preparation of  a Code ofBegulations for the painting of buildings.  Two of our membera*and the Secretary have taken part in the Conferences which havebeen held.  As a result, a draft  Code of  Eegulations (Appendix  VIII) hasbeen unanimously accepted by both sides of the Joint  IndustrialCouncil and ha-s been approved also by  the National  Federationof Building Tirades Employers with only  a minor reservation.These draft Eegulations cover all the points referred to in Article 5of the Geneva Convention except that relating to the  obligatorynotification of lead poisoning,  and we think  that  they meet thecase and should be adopted  The-enforcement of Eegulations for. the painting of buildingspresents special difficulties, since  the  place where the painter is employed  is  constantly changing, and  so much  of the work iscarried on  in private  houses.  It was  largely on this accountthat the previous Committees  rejected this means of  regulating the  use  of  lead paint.  We have considered whether it would not  be possible, for themain part of the work of enforcement,  to  call upon the trade interests concerned to organise an approved inspection  schemeso that Government action in  the matter might be reduced to aminimum.    The good will existing  between  both sides of thePainters&apos; Joint  Council at the present  time shows,  we  think,that,  as  regards the  members of  that body,  there  should helittle difficulty in securing observance of the Eegulations  in thisway.  We understand that, this principle of &quot; internal &quot; inspec-tion has  been already agreed to for a somewhat similar purpose.!We think that  &apos;&apos; internal &apos;&apos; inspection might also be tried in thecase of the proposed Eegulations  for the house painting  trade,the Factory Inspectors being  given the necessary powers to dealwith  complaints,  cases of  lead  poisoning,  and  other  specialmatters.  Unfortunately this proposal will not meet at once thecase of the non-federated employers and workmen, but we thinkthat its acceptance by the federated parties should help to secure its  general adoption   without  incuning the cost of  systematicGovernment  inspection, and  to  establish  a general  custom ofobservance of the Eegulations throughout the country.  The onus of observance  will, no doubt, be placed on the em-ployer,  hut  both  sides of. the   Joint  Council  agree that, in  * Mr. Bellhouse and Dr. Legge.  &apos;f An undertaking, to this effect was given by the Joint Industrial Council of.the Building Trade when the issue of the Draft Regulations (not yet in force;to secure greater safety on buildings in course of construction, alteration,repair, or demolition was under consideration. Visits by the &quot;Factory Inspectorswere to be confined to dealing with special matters that might arise, e.g., com-plaints as to the non-observance of  the Regulations.
cases where  the employer does all  in his power to  enforce thelaw and  Regulations,  and  where,  nevertheless,  contraventionoccurs, without his knowledge or consent,  through the act of aforeman or workman, the employer shall be exempt  from prose-ration and the liability shall be transferable to the actual offender.The same principle  finds expression,  as  regards factories and workshops, in Section  141 of the Factory and  Workshop Act,1901, and should be adopted  in regard to this matter.         OTHER  INDUSTRIAL  PAINTING, The  Geneva  Convention  was  undoubtedly meant  to applymainly, if not entirely,  to the painting of buildings.  It is neces-tary, however, to consider here what action should be taken inregard to other classes of industrial painting, e.g., coach painting,preparatory priming work in joinery establishments, ship paint-ing, and the like, where lead paint is used. As regards coach painting, there is a good deal  more to beaid for complete prohibition than in the case of house painting.In this trade there is evidence that important firms of carriagemd wagon builders use no  lead at  all.   But we feel  even here(hat  there is not yet  sufficient  evidence  to show that  all thepolities  of  white lead can  be  found in  its  substitutes; and,provided  therefore  that  Regulations prohibiting dry rubbingtown, and otherwise protecting  the workers  are enforced, web not recommend prohibition. We recommend, therefore, that the use of lead paint in all theselasses of industrial painting should be made subject to Regula-tions, and in  particular that dry rubbing down of lead paint shouldlemade illegal.   Power to make Regulations already exists under   Factory  Acts,  and we think  that steps should be  taken  bylie Home Office to give effect to this recommendation. Moreover,  in view of  the necessity  of adequate ventilation whenIternal painting is in progress on  shipboard,  to counteract thefeet of the fumes of the paint thinners,  the Regulations for suchfork should, in  our opinion,  include a definite provision to secureMs result whether lead paint is used or not. NOTIFICATION   OF.  LEAD   POISONING  AMONG                  HOUSE PAINTERS. The draft  Code  of Regulations for the  painting of  buildings&quot;&quot;bodies  all the requirements of Article 5 of  the Geneva Con-Wion, with the exception  of Ilia, relating to  the  compulsoryItification and  certification of  suspected  lead  poisoning cases&quot;Hong  painters.  It was felt that  this particular requirementshould be  dealt  with by Statute, to conform with  Section  73tfthe factory  and Workshop Act, 1901.   The notification of
                                                            !factory  and workshop lead poisoning cases is required by this section in two ways :      (1)  by the medical  practitioner  who attends or is called in I            to, visit  the patient whom he believes to be suffering&apos;            from  such lead poisoning.   This  notice  has to be j            sent to the Chief Inspector  of Factories;     (2)  from the occupier of  the  factory or  workshop,  to tie I            local factory inspector and certifying surgeon.   The dual requirement assists in preventing such  cases from I being overlooked, and the notices sent under (2), if prompt, gitt j the officials in  question  early opportunity to make the necesssrj j investigations.   We consider that these  requirements  should  be. extended mutatis mutandis to the cases of  suspected lead poisoning con- tracted  in  the painting of buildings.   By the above means it will be possible to compile, in  future, the  full   statistics  of  lead  poisoning  as  contemplated b; Article 7 (a) of  the Geneva Convention.   The Registrar-Generals mortality statistics satisfy the- requirements  of  Article 7 (b) clthe Convention.     PAINT TECHNOLOGY : NEED FOR FURTHEB                         RESEARCH.    We have based our conclusions  against prohibition mainly i the grounds that there  is at present no adequate substitute!! lead paint  for  certain classes of painting. We are, however, bj no means  satisfied  that the  possible alternatives for lead con- pounds have yet been sufficiently studied or tested in this count) to  warrant the-  expression  of  a final  opinion.  There is lift. authoritative scientific information as to the relative behaviour and economy  of the various paint  bases and other paint con- stituents under different conditions of  use,  application andes-. posure, and this sufficiently explains why such conflicting vies are expressed  as to the comparative merits of lead and leadte paints.   Testing work has been done by British, American, an&apos; Continental investigators at different times, but the work tato as a  whole is a very incomplete guide to the paint user, and fc results  often  fail to carry conviction  because the experimental work is regarded, rightly or wrongly, as having been&apos;undertake  from an ex parte  standpoint.   The conclusions, moreover, an vitiated in many cases by the omission to record essential factors    We  think, therefore, that the time  has come for the appoi*  ment of a Technical Commission for  the  investigation  of sW*  problems  connected with  British paint  technology as dentf  solution in the general interests.     The need for further investigation will become the more m&quot;&apos;  perative if some measure of prohibition of white lead, such.as&apos;&apos;  have suggested, is adopted.   The general public should, we, tin&quot;&apos;
be assured of every possible assistance in connection with  the choice of substitutes. If a measure of prohibition is to be adopted in 1927, havingregard to the long period necessary to obtain adequate exposuretests on paints, we would point out that the initiation&apos;of authori-tative investigations is a matter of great urgency. Among other important matters calling for scientific investiga-tiou the following may be mentioned :    (1) Relative efficiencies of various mixtures of bases;   (2) Difficulties connected with the standardisation of paints :,   (3) Testing  of   new . paint  bases and  other new  paint.         materials;   (4) Exemptions from prohibition requirements; .  (a) Relative values of different  substitutes for turpentine. The witnesses who appeared before us were, with one excep-tion, in full agreement with our view that further investigationwas, if not essential, at  least desirable.  The fact that  they soexpressed themselves points  to  the uncertainty  which prevailsin matters of paint  efficiency and economy. The  growing  importance   of  paint  technology is  further&apos;emphasised by a recent decision of leading members of the  Paintand Varnish Society and the Oil and  Colour Chemists&apos;  Associa-tion to form an Institute of  Paint  and Varnish Technologists.:No doubt the new Institute will play an important part in  thefuture in connection with scientific, developments in such work. A technical committee acting under Government direction and assisted by each interest prominently involved would carry  thenecessary  authority  for, the  purpose.   The  Department   ofbcienlific and Industrial Research is, no doubt, the GovernmentDepartment which ought to  control the work, and therefore wewink that Department  should be asked to  take up the problem;,and to include  representatives of the  following interests in any committee or other organisation  set. up for the  purpose :-   (1) Paint-using  Departments of  the  Government;   (2) Painters Employers and. Operatives ;   (3) Manufacturers of Paints;    ,   (4) Architects;            &apos;   (5) Chemists.tfOTURE POLICY IN  REGARD TO THE PAINTING  OP            GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.  We had to give early  consideration to this matter, not only because  of its inclusion  among  those referred to us, but also because  Sir Prank Baines when giving  his evidence requested the Committee to  express its views as to whether, for externtapainting, the Office of Works might not relax at once its policy01 what  was, in fact,  total prohibition of lead.   He made this: ^nest because  of the pressing need  for economy  in his pro-
gramme of painting for the  next financial year,  which  couldnot be  effected, he  said, unless he were  permitted  to resume the use of lead paint for this part of the  work.  In support of his statements Sir Frank Baines furnished to theCommittee the return (Appendix V) concerning the conditions ofthe surfaces of external woodwork on several Government build-ings in London which needed re-painting, and the composition ofpaint scrapings taken therefrom. Members of the  Committeeafterwards visited some of these buildings,  so as to see for them-selves  the conditions complained of.    Certain  members, too,visited the London County  Council  School at Exmouth Street,St. Pancras, where the external woodwork was painted in 1916with lead paint.   This was hi a condition of good general preser-vation.   On the other hand the examination of the paintwork onthe Government  buildings revealed  marked disintegration andremoval of the paint on an extensive scale, and,  in so far  as an examination of this  character may be regarded as of value, theCommittee felt that Sir Frank Baines was justified in  the seriousview he&apos;took of the matter, although no evidence was  producedthat the most suitable leadless paints had been used.  The evidence as regards durability was, moreover,  confirmed by that obtained  from the other sources mentioned  previously.The cumulative effect of all the new evidence was, obviously,that there was a  marked increase of cost involved in the main-tenance of external surfaces painted with non-lead paint.  Important as the question of  economy is at the present  time,we could not regard that alone as an adequate reason for allowingworkers in Government employ to be exposed to  risks of lead poisoning through any change of policy as regards the kind ofpaint they  are to use.    We are satisfied, however,  that the dangers attendant upon the use of lead paint can be minimised bymeans of Regulations providing for the abolition of dry rubbingdown, for adequate arrangements for  personal cleanliness,  and,where necessary,  for medical examination of the workers. What-ever difficulty  there may be in enforcing Regulations for paintingwork undertaken by private contractors, there ought to be nodifficulty  in their enforcement by  a Government Departmentcarrying out its own painting work.   We have come to the conclusion,  therefore, that there is no adequate reason why the Departments  of State  responsible forthe painting of Government  buildings or other Government pro-perty should be subject, in their choice of materials, to special restrictions which are not  applied to private  contractors.  Wetherefore informed Sir Frank Baines that we saw  no reason why,as regards external painting,  the policy of the. OfGce of works should not be modified as he  desired.   At the same time we are strongly of opinion that, if  lead paint is used, adequate precau-tions must be taken to protect the workers,  and that its use should  be subject to  Regulations  such as have recently  been
agreed to at the conferences between the representatives of theHome Office and the Joint Industrial Councils of Painters andDecorators. Looking beyond the needs of the  moment, we think that, asthe question of legislation  for  the  painting  of buildings will shortly demand consideration by  reason of  the terms  of the geneva Convention, the Government should,&apos;in any Bill whichmay be  brought forward as a Government measure,  make thepainting of Government property  subject to  the proposed law.This principle is already followed  in the present Factory Acts,a special provision (Section  150,  Factory and Workshop Act,1901) enacting  that  Crown  factories and workshops shall besubject to the various provisions of the factory laws and  also tothe Eegulations introduced under these laws.  We desire to express our high appreciation of the help afforded to us by our  Secretary, Mr.  Charles W. Price. His intimateacquaintance with the voluminous literature of the subject,  hisuseful personal inquiries on our behalf into many matters, andthe energy and efficiency  he  has  displayed throughout the inquiry,  have  combined  to  render  the  Committee  invaluableservice.                     .-&apos;  HENRY NORMAN, Chairman.                       .

APPENDIX II. PBAFT CONVENTION- CONCERNING THE USE OP WHITE LEAD IN PAINTING. 1 The General  Conference of the  International  Labour  Organisation  oftlie League of Nations,    Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the  International Labour Office,  and having met in its Third Session on  25th October, 1921,  and    Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard  to the prohibition of the use of  white lead in painting, which is the  sixth item of the agenda of the Session, and    Having determined, that  these proposals shall take  the form of a  draft international  convention,    Madopts the following  Draft  Convention for  ratification by the membersof the International Labour  Organisation, in accordance  with the pro-visions of  Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and of the correspondingParts of the other Treaties  of Peace.                             Article 1.  Each member  of  the International  Labour  Organisation ratifying the present Convention undertakes to prohibit,  with the exceptions provided for in Article  2, the  use of white lead and sulphate of lead and of  all products containing these pigments, in the internal painting of buildings, raept where the use of white lead or sulphate of lead or products con- taining these  pigments  is  considered  necessary  for railway stations  or industrial  establishments by the competent authority  after  consultation sift the employers&apos; and&apos;workers&apos; organisations concerned.  It shall  nevertheless be permissible to use white pigments containing a maximum  of 2 per cent,  of lead expressed  in terms of metallic lead.                             Article 2.  Hie provisions of Article 1 shall not apply  to  artistic painting or fine lining.  The Governments  shall  define the  limits of such forms of painting, Md shall  regulate the use  of white lead, sulphate  of lead, and  all pro- nncts containing these pigments, for these  purposes in conformity with the provisions  of Articles  5, 6 and 7 of the present Convention.                             Article 3.                            &apos;.;-.,..

                          APPENDIX V.                            O                                                                     0 PARTICULARS OF PAINT SCRAPINGS TAKEN FROM GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.  Covering Minute by Sir Frank Baines, dated 20th  December, 1921,                    addressed to the Secretary. In accordance  with  the promise that I made to the Committee at themeeting held  on  the 13th instant, I forward herewith the particulars ofpaint samples taken from buildings  in the  charge of  the  Department inthe Whitehall  area. The particulars give the name of the building, the position from whichthe scrapings were taken, the date when  it was last painted, togetherwith a note of the paint used when the building was first erected. With regard to the  latter  point, it should be observed that many of thepublic buildings now in the  charge of the Department were erected underthe supervision of architects in private practice, who specify the materials which they are accustomed  to use,  and in nearly all instances prefer  a lead base paint for painting woodwork. Upon  iall the buildings included in the schedule,  re-painting is beingcarried  out, as it  was due during  the current  year, and the necessary funds have been  included in the Annual Estimates. One position has however been left untreated, in order  that it may beinspected if necessary by the members  of  the Committee, but it  shouldoe  noted that an  inspection should take place at a  comparatively earlydate in the  New  Tear, otherwise  instructions  must be  given  for thecleaning and re-painting,  in  order  that the whole  of the work  on theWilding may be  finished.  Attention is drawn to the analyses of the paint scrapings, which also aresiren.   They  were taken  by a  representative  from the  GovernmentChemist, who  endeavoured  to separate the upper coats  from the loweroats, and thus  obtain an analysis of both.  It was found  somewhat  difficult,  for the upper  coats (which  in allinstances  were  of O.W.  zinc  base  paint) have almost  disappeared,leaving  exposed  the under coat, which in the majority of cases is  a  leadtee paint, and  presumably ie that  originally applied when the buildingns erected.  Since 1907, this  Department has,  with few exceptions,  used no  paintscontaining  more  than 5 per cent, of soluble lead, and the analyses of the^apings  attached in the  Schedule  are therefore very  interesting, as showing that the later coatings of zinc paint have almost disappeared and &quot;shed  away. . \ shah be glad  to  know whether  the Committee desire to inspect the ouildings included  in  the Schedule.

Small percentage of zinc oxide present would appear to point clearly to fact that the two coats of &quot; O.W.&quot; Paint (zinc oxide base) applied .in 1912 have almost entirely dis-appeared. Fact that it was possible to take sample in fairly large pieces is con-sistent with large percentage of lead found.							100-0

This   paintwork  showed no signs of the aerious  defects which  were  apparent  on  the work  opposite, and  difference  in  condition of  work on two sides is no doubt  due  to difference  of aspect;  the work in  a  bad condition  on  the N. side of Courtyard  (Sample  1)  is exposed to  direct  sunlight,  which   is  known to have a  destructive  effect on the oil.GO

From analysis it would appear  that whilst a fair amount  of  zinc paint applied in 1916 still  remains  the protection still  existing is mainly due to the  white lead of the lead paints  originally applied.Sample  4 was taken  from   a  ground  floor window which  was fully  exposed to weather.

JEtomarJoa.     Apart from being dirty and discoloured, the work from which samples 2, 3 and 4 were taken (which was last painted in 1895 with  white lead paint) was in a remarkably good condition, its protective  qualities remaining unimpaired.  This  applies especially to the paint on  the iron columns (sample 2) and all tbis paint had a very firm hold on the iron or stone surface under.     The paint on woodwork last painted with white lead in 1907 (sample 6) was in fairly good condition, but blistering was apparent in afew places.     The zinc oxide base paint used in 1913 was applied over a portion of the work previously painted in 1895 with lead paint and the analysis of tbe scrapings taken from some of this work  shows clearly that the two  coats  of zinc oxide paint then  applied  have  almost entirelydisappeared.   (See analyses of  samples IA, 1B and 5.)   The paintwork in the  Oentral Archway (samples IA and IB) which had been washedseveral  times  since 1913, presented quite a  mottled  appearance, and  it was clearly visible that the top coatings had entirely disappearedin some places so exposing the original lead coatings underneath.   Comxiaring samples IA and 1B it will be noted that whilst  in the exposedposition tbe zinc oxide has practically disappeared, a little does remain in the more protected portions.
                           APPENDIX VI.FORM 1708.203,818/91.  The  Secretary  of  State desires  to  draw  attention to  the Reports(Cd. 7882 and Cmd. 630), of the Departmental Committees which investi-gated the  danger to  workers in the building and coach  painting  tradesfrom the use of lead paints.  As a result of these inquiries,  it has beenestablished that  quite as satisfactory results can be obtained with non-poisonous paints a,s with white lead paint (except for heraldic painting andfine lining), and both Committees recommend that (subject to these excep-tions), the use of any paint containing more than 5 per  cent,  of its dryweight  of  a soluble  lead  compound (to  be determined  in the mannerspecified in the Reports), should be prohibited.  In view  of  the numerous cases of lead poisoning which have occurred in these trades, the Secretary of State hopes that employers who are stillusing lead  paints will now arrange to discontinue their  use and  substitutepaints which comply with the specifications  drawn up by the Committees.  Only paints of the character  recommended by the Committees are nowbeing used by H.M.  Office  of  Works for  Government Buildings.   Tillrecently  a  certain difficulty  was  experienced in  obtaining  non-poisonouspaints suitable for the priming of iron, but as is shown by the enclosedmemorandum drawn up by the Office  of Works, this difficulty has now been overcome.  For more detailed information on this point,  application maybe made to Mr. W. Pott, Principal Architect of the Office of Works.  HOME OFFICE,      Whitehall, S.W.1,              June,  1920.MEMORANDUM BY H.M. OFFICE  OF WORKS  ON THE TEST  OF NON-POISONOUS               PAINTS FOR &quot; PRIMING&apos;&quot; IRON AND STEEL.  It is  now 12 or  13 years since the Department decided to adopt non-poisonous paints  for use on buildings in their charge and the results haveieen satisfactory.  It is found that paints prepared on a  base of zinc, iron oxide,  etc., withjjroper mediums, afford quite as good protection to wood  and ironwork aspaints mixed on  a lead base, and the risk of lead poisoning to the  mixersand users  of the paint is thereby eliminated.  The question  was raised by  the Home Office  Committee  on  paints it.1911  whether it  was not  also  possible  to dispense  with  red and  orangelead as &quot; primers &quot; for iron and steel and  to arrive at a decision it wasdecided to carry out la- series of tests at Kew Gardens.  These were conducted on about 100 samples supplied  by specialist paintfirms or mixed to specifications prepared by the Department.  They were also tested alongside red and orange lead paints.  The ^pigments used in the samples included lead carbonate, lead oxide,lead chromate,  zinc  oxide, lithopone, zinc chromate,  barium  chromate,various iron  oxides,  graphite, ibitumen, with  the usual  &quot; extendersbarium sulphate, silica and magnesium silicate, in various proportions.  It was recognised that pigment is  not the only factor in the composition of paint,  the medium  being very important  in a protective paint film-Linseed oil is the medium most commonly used in the samples but  this i&quot;many cases had an addition of  good varnish, Chinese tung oil or tung oilvarnish.  .The samples were all put on duplicate  iron plates which  had beeithoroughly cleaned and  dried in the painters&apos; shop, each sample covering an area of about 12 inches by 4 inches.  After two days one  plate iff8exposed to the  weather on a wall facing south  and the second plate athe  warm  damp  atmosphere of a tropical greenhouse.  The  conditions *
this latter case were most severe as there was always condensation on theplates and  they  were  often  sprayed with water  when  the plants  were,receiving attention.                        .           - The plates were  examined  once  every 12 months over  a period of four:years by three officers of the  Department and marks awarded  at  eachexamination. The best  results  under  the conditions obtaining in the  tropical green-house were given by the red leads,  which gained the first and fourth places in the list, but  mixed paints  on  bases of zinc and lead  chromate  weresecond and third on the list;  others with iron oxide, lead zinc and barium,chromate,  and zinc and  iron  oxide,  were respectively  fifth,  sixth  and.seventh  on  the list, and  all  gave  very good results.  Most  of these bestpaints had a special medium. The most important tests, however)1 from a practical point of view were those of  plates exposed to the weather under ordinary conditions. The first  places were taken by  a  black iron  oxide paint  and a silica-graphite paint these being bracketed equal whilst another silica-graphite&apos;paint was placed  second.   Lead chromate paints and mixtures of chromateof lead and zinc, zinc  chromate, and lead zinc  and barium  chromate, alLtook high places, as also oxides of iron with and without  zinc. The silica-graphite paints were considered suitable for use as &quot; primers &quot;when followed by similar  paint.   They give no tooth for  hard  finishings.and when they are used as finishings are liable to rub off where  handledtat they are good for  bridges, roofs, etc. Hod lead paint  was 17th  on the list,  under ordinary  exposure,  thus.showing  that  suitable  paints  can he  obtained  that obviate  the use of thispoisonous material. It should he stated that all the paints referred to were mixed paints assupplied by various makers and  the maximum of 5 per  cent, of soluble-lead, as  recommended  by  the Home Office  Committee, was not  exceeded..                        APPENDIX VII.    HOME OFFICE INQUIRIES,  1921, PRIOR TO GENEVA CONFERENCE.                     Summary of Information, &apos;fho replies in  general clearly indicated that the substitution of leadless-Pauits had made but little real progress, and  .that such paints were heldgenerally in but little esteem by  paint users,  particularly for outside useN for severe conditions internally.

  The Admiralty have  drawn  up  very complete  regulations  governing the  use  of Lead Paints.  Prison  Commission. In  this Department the use  of  &quot; soluble lead &quot;paints appears to be restricted  in general to the greatest possible extent.It is proposed to  observe  the  5  per cent,  limit  of  &quot; soluble lead &quot; (as recommended by the 1911  Committees) in future.  This  report  indicates that &quot; Purex &quot;  (a lead sulphate base paint) was being used on the wrongassumption  that it  is non-poisonous.  The relative value of leadless  substitutes  is not discussed.  The workof the Commission  is done as  far  as possible by  prison labour.  Metropolitan  Police. The work on buildings is  done with zinc painit;that on boats and vehicles  with lead.City and Borough Councils.  Replies were received from 41  Councils, including  Birmingham,  Man-chester,  Liverpool,  Leeds,   Sheffield,  Bradford,  Cardiff,  Salford,  Ply-mouth, etc.   The buildings,  etc., covered by these reports, were of various kinds, e.g.,  Town  Halls,   Municipal Offices,  Libraries,  Police  Stations,Park and Cemetery Buildings,  Dwelling Houses,  Cas Works, Baths andWashhouses,  etc.  Detailed statements from  different departments were sent from several Councils.  Painting carried on by Tramway Departments,both as regards the upkeep  of cars and buildings, is summarised under the heading of Tramway Companies.  In certain cases it is frankly  indicated that there had been no attemptto eliminate &quot; lead,&quot; and that dn consequence there  is no experience ofleadless paints to record.  White lead  is  regarded generally  as  being markedly superior  forexposed  positions   in   manufacturing  centres.  War-time  substitutes,where used, proved very unsatisfactory, leading some Councils to resume the use of lead.  Cardiff and Norwich and certain departments of otherCouncils report, on the other hand,  that lead  paints   are not  used.Differences of opinion, in view of the varying circumstances, are found inreports from the same  Council.  The painting staffs are often quite small, only two or three  painters,perhaps, being  employed.  In several cases  it is stated  that substitutescost  more than lead&apos;.  Certain authorities, e.g., Oldham,  Gloucester, pro-,posed  to go  on with   experiments  with  substitutes.  These would,  itappeared, be on a small scale.   There is considerable  reference to the useof distemper paints  for  internal  work.  It  seems  fairly clear  thai-considerable thought has been given in the past to the matter of finding the  most suitable pigment for the  particular job in  hand.  The following expression  of opinions were  included  in the  replies:      (a) White lead  is  beet under the atmospheric conditions  in  manu-          factm-ing cities.   (Birmingham, Leeds,  Manchester,  Rochdale,          Bradford.)    (b) White lead  is best  for  undercoating where there is  exposure to          sea  water  or  sea  air.   (Southend.)  It  is  a  considerable          advantage to have a proportion of white lead for  painting at          seaside places. (Hastings.)    (c) Zinc  White has  a tendency  to turn black under the action of  sea          water.  (Wallasey.)    (d) Lead paint is best  for baths  and  washhouses.   (Liverpool, Leeds.          In the former city Zinc Oxide has  been given  a  considerable          trial, and Antimony Oxide a short trial,  with  unsatisfactory          results.)    (e) Leadless  paints  are  unsatisfactory  for  gas  lamp  interiors.          (Bury-)                                            ,    (/) Bridge  painting  and steel  and iron work in  general  may          satisfactorily  dealt with  by means  of  non-lead  paints.  This          covers  painting  of gas holders  and  girder work  in  general,          pipes, etc.  (Manchester,  Bury,  Rochdale.)
   (g) Lead paints  are best for boiler  houses.  (Birmingham-Electric        Supply.)   (ft) Lead paints are quite unsuitable in gas works owing to sulphur        fumes.  (Bradford.)Tramway Companies (including Local Authority Tramway Departments). Landless paints have made  much further headway in tramcar  painting,and emphasis is laid in several reports on the value of substitutes for theinternal painting  of  the cars.  The replies from Birmingham,  Sheffield,Newport, Cardiff, Hull, Burton-upon-Trenf, etc.,  show  that white leadis no longer used for  the work. On the other hand,  there are several adverse reports,  e.g., Manchester,Liverpool, Plymouth,  Bradford,  Bournemouth,  Blackburn,  Rochdale,Wallasey, in which places lead is still  used because it is said to be more satisfactory. The practice in regard to  the painting of buildings  as  distinct fromears is  often different.  Substitutes for the former purpose  are  adverselycommented upon,  even where regarded as satisfactory for the  latter.In Leeds, however, the position  is  reversed, leadless paints being usedcn the  buildings, while lead paint is said to be  necessary for the cars. Tho Newport statement shows that,  although  substitutes have beenidopted,  without  difficulty, the newer paints have not the same lastingqualities. Further experimental  work  is  indicated  in some   of  the  reports.(Liverpool, Oldham, West Ham.) The very important Tramway  ,Oompanies of  the  Metropolitan  TrafficCombine do not use white lead, but &quot; Purex &quot; (see above) has been usedto a considerable extent, under tbe impression that it is  non-poisonous. The report  from Chester indicates that, although leadless plaints are used internally on the cars, lead paints are used for the  small amount ofsternal painting. Special interest attaches to the report  from Bradford,  as the evidenceof lit.  C. J. Spencer, the General Manager, before the 1911 Comimittee,*indicated that at that time  lead  paints  had been  completely discarded.The present general  manager, Mr. R.  H. Wilkinson,   indicates clearly that the results  from the leadless paints used since   1915 have beenunsatisfactory, &quot; chalking &quot; setting in at various times  after 12 months. A10 per cent,  addition of white lead has been adopted, therefore, for the last two  years,  with  some apparent  success.  His conclusion is that no substitute has the same durability as white lead.foSmy Companies. Nineteen replies were  received, most  of the  important  English com- Pinies  giving  particulars of their  present  practice.   The expjerience&quot;mcides somewhat closely with that of the tramway  authorities.  Several  of the  principal companies have adopted what  is practically &apos;  leadless &quot; programme for their carriages and wagons, e.g.,  Midland, weat  Western,  Great Central,   Great  Eastern,   and  Lancashire  and wkshire.  The locomotives of the Midland and Great  Central lines are aw mainly painted  with non-lead  paints.  We practice of the Midland Railway, referred to in the  report  of the &quot;U  Coach Painting  Committee  (Cmd.  630), Las  been  maintained patently since. The  report says  that0 &quot; the general result of using e*ss paints for our rolling stock is satisfactory.&quot;  Other companies have  not had favourable results from the leadles6 wstitutes tried on rolling stock, e.g.,  South-Western,  Great Northern, ***  British, Metropolitan  Lines.* See pp. 5, 38 ; Cmd. 680..1 &apos;  &quot;^SHrwrsa
   A report by the Inspector of  Factories on the Wolverton Carriage and Wagon Department  of the  North-Western  Railway showed that  no lead- less, paints: as  substitutes for lead paints  were in use, but Mr.  Mason,* the manager,  was experimenting  with leadless paints  on certain marked running coaches as to durability  and cost, etc.,  but had  not arrived at any definite conclusion.   The Great Western  Company is  extending the use of  leadless  paint, the 1920 consumption  being 1,041 tons of leadless and  733 tons of  lead paint.. This covers  all painting vehicles, buildings,  bridges, etc.   A similar distinction between the painting of buildings and  vehicles, as already noted in the  case  of  tramway companies,  is  also drawn in these reports.   Thus the Midland Company say,  &quot; as concerns buildings, bridges, fences, etc., we have experimented with leadless paints, but, so far, without satisfactory  results; practically  the whole of this  class of work  is still  being  done  with lead  paints.&quot;  The Great Eastern  find similar results, especially for exterior purposes.   A few points of minor  importance in the reports are of interest:     (a) The  Midland  Company&apos;s engine  buffer planks are painted with a &quot; leaded&quot;  vermilion,  regarded  as necessary to  secure  the  requisite brilliance.   Lead sulphate bases, although they have given satisfaction  in paint on carriage  stock, have failed for jointing,   and on  exposure to weather. (Midland and  Great  Western Railway of Ireland.) Omnibus Company.   The  London  General  Omnibus  Company  now  use  paints for  vehicles which  are  free from  all trace of white lead.   This has also been largelyeliminated for buildings where its sole use is for external work, for  which it is considered to have  greater  preservative powers.   The  buildings con-cerned are chiefly garages, offices, messrooms, workshops, etc.Reports of the  Inspectors of Factories.  These  reports included  considerable  reference to some of the  railwaypremises already mentioned, and the latter are therefore not dealt withbelow,  as the information  coincides with that given by the companies.  The  inspectors  found that lead paints  are  still regarded as the best for durability,  but in coach and motor building the use of leadless paintshas a considerable field, as might  be anticipated from  the  reports of the tramway  and  railway  companies.   Information  is given  of a  numberof the  works where leadless  paints are alone used, and particulars of the paints.   Some  inspectors  found, however,   that carriage builders regardlead as indispensable for the priming coats, and  others  again that lead-less  paints  are regarded  as  entirely unsatisfactory.  Although in building work the adoption of leadless paint was foundto be much  more restricted, there is some mention, of firms  using  suchpaint for both  inside and  outside work.  As regards buildings in Scotland, it is   reported that zinc white  hasreplaced lead  to  a fair  extent, but  it is not  indicated  whether suchsubstitution  is mainly for inside purposes  or not. The supply firms  are said to give  widely differing accounts of the  present position as  regardssales of both classes.  In shipbuilding the use of lead paints obtains fairly  extensively,  butfor the enclosed spaces lead  is often eliminated or cat down  to a  small percentage.* Member of 1911 Uoach Painting Committee.
