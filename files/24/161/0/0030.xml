48DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITAMIC MAJESWS GO:VERNMffi&apos;i         Proposed reduction of the Army in India.   Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.     On the 4th instant the Cabinet agreed to the proposal of the Secretary of State for India as modified by the.note of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff of the 30th Juneregarding the reduction of certain Cavalry Regiments in India.     Part of the proposal was, that while two cavalry regiments should be permanently brought back from Indiaand placed on the Home Establishment,  one should be retained in India, the sum of  75,000 to be paid to India towardsthe cost of this Regiment by way of rebate off the expensethrown on the India Exchequer by the 1919 increase in the pay of the British soldier.     At my request this payment was withheld and it was referred to Lord Derby and Lord Peel in conjunction withmyself for further consideration.  We have fully consideredthe. matter and I feel that the matter involves an issue ofsuch grave importance that I must ask the Cabinet not to sanction payment, and on this the Secretary of State forIndia desires that the matter should be re-considered by theCabinet.     It is a fundamental principle of our rule in india that the Home Government is responsible for the protectionof India and for the number and equipment of our troopsCABINETm X **
which must be kept there.   It is an equally fundamentalprinciple that the cost of these troops must be borne by india.   I submit that on no other basis could our positionin India be maintained for twelve months.     It is not merely the protection of India from Frontierdisturbances or from internecine or sporadio. warfare butthe protection of our English fellow subjects who aregoverning or trading there and the retention of India asa corner stone in the whole of our Empire position, andthese,two latter points must be deoided by the ImperialGovernment, not by India.     If the Cabinet agrees - and the fact that they navsdecided that the Regiment in question must remain in India,I submit, proves that they do - then arises the question&apos;of payment.     The first argument used is that we did, .during theWar, put upon India, without consulting her, a largeinsrease in the pay of the British soldiers amounting toSx millions per annum and that we&apos; are conscientiously boundto help India in her present trouble by reason of that fact.     If this is correct,  75,000 per annum is a veryunconscientious payment towards an improper imposition of x millions and if we onoe pay this sum with an admissionof this as the reason for doing so, India will very rightlyreply; - &quot;Your conscience is easily satisfied, we should&quot;like a couple of millions towards the cost of our Army&quot;.     If on the other hand,, it is not desired to admitwhat I have called the conscientious reason, the only other
** 3 mexcuse for paying the money is that India will not keepthe Regiment without it;    but that brings us up againstthe arguments contained in the earlier part of thismemorandum and if we are once to admit that the objectioncf India to retain a Cavalry Regiment can only be overcome by payment either in whole or part for the cost of suchRegiment from the Home Exchequer, we shall find an intimation from India in the course of the next year ortwo, that India is so quiet, that the Amir is so friendly,,that the Native Army is so loyal, that India is preparedto dispense with, say, five Battalions of British trwp&amp;e          Answer on the lines of -the earlier $art -of thismemorandum.   &quot;Very good&apos;/ say India., &quot;we appeal to the&quot;precedent of the Cavalry Regiment and if you think these&quot;Infantry Battalions are necessary, which we do not, we&quot;must ask you politely and firmly to pay the cost&quot;,,          The Secretary of State for India has asked mein preparing this Memorandum to oonsider the Report of theSub-Committee on indian military Requirements, dated 22ndJune, 1922, as amended and approved by R\,Mf Government onthe 26th January, 192S,  (CIoD, Paper 130 - D),          1 have referred especially to Paragraphs 2 0, n,12, 22, 23 and 24, which deal with the relations betweenthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Army inIndia and with the appointment of Secretary in the MilitaryDepartment of the India Office, but I can see nothing in either of these sections - or indeed in the whole Reportitself - at variance with the main lines of the argumentI hate above set out     In  fact,  I would  draw the  attention
Of my colleagues to the first conclusion of the Government!as follows:*     Conclusion,,          3;9   While the whole of the resouroes of Britain          will in the future, as in the past, he available          to support the Government of&quot;. India in maintaining          British supremacy in India if it is seriously          threatended, it is the recognised duty of India          to provide for her own defence against external          and internal dangers in all hut the gravest          emergencies,          I might also quote the first part of the conclusion on the third section of the Beport as follows:-   ;     Conclusion.          12i  The view of Lord Usher&apos;s Committee that the          Chief of the Imperial General Staff, with the          approval of the Secretary of State for War.          should &quot;be the supreme military adviser to the          Secretary of State for India,  as he is to other          Ministers of His Majesty&apos;s Government on          questions of Imperial strategy; is supported0          The matter is not one of  75,000., it is one ofprinciple, vitally important to the whole basis of our rule in India and I trust my colleagues will uphold the views which I have expressed in this memorandum.W,J-H019.7.23.
