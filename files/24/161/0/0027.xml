ITHIS DOCUMENT IS&apos;THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT]ISBCBET,C.P.  327  (23)CABINET,Copy NoiIS^Om^J\FFhJRB_COMMITTEE. Merchandise Marks Bill0   Memorandurn^ bvM;ho^iinlater of Agriculture and Fisheries,         This Bill has now passed Standing Committee.of  the House of ommons, after a very long debEite.  When  It was first  introduced  the cabinet decided that I was to say in the House of Commons  that  it looked favourably on the Bill and the Cabinet also  expressed itself eady to consider the question of the Government giving facilities or the Bill after it had passed through Committee.         I am now bringing it before the Home Affairs Committee  at he instruction of the Prime Minister, and I would  suggest that the overnment adopt the Bill with certain modificatiohs,  and  that  I onduct. it on the report stage.         The principal modifications suggested are that  the pro-gisions in Clauses 1 and 2 relating to meat should be  limited to rozen or chilled meat and to bacon and ham, and that  fruit and vegetables be omitted from the Bill.   As regards fresh meat, fruit,                                      as                    cu h 4e jnd vegetables, the provisions would be^difficult to enforce If little practical  advantage.         I am inclined to think that with those alterations the Jill might go through without very much opposition.  A good --. fcny members both of the Liberal and Labour parties are quite in    favour and the opposition has really  come from  a small but [lkotive band.
