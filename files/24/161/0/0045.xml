q Jr./g DQOromgl  IS THE PROPERTY CP HIS BRITAMIO MAJESTY^ COVEPHMERTT.      International Protocol for the recognitionof the validity of Commercial Arbitration Agreements,    Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,     I  circulate to my oolleagues copy  of  a  draft Protocol for the better international recognition of Arbitration 01au3es in commercial and other contracts, with covering letter received from the Seoretary-General of the League of  Rations.     It is expeoted that at the next meeting of the Assembly this Protoool will be open for signature by  any of the Members of the League, and I ask that the British Delegate should be authorised to accept and sign it on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.     The Protoool is the result of long and  oomplioated enquiries; discussions and negotiations initiated by the British Member of the loonomio Committee of the League owing to strong represehta- tions received by the Board of Trade through our oommeroial organisations, and in particular from the British Group of tho International Chamber of Commerce.     The oommeroial community are seriously  alarmed at the continued failure of oertain foreign countries to reoognise the validity of Arbitration Clauses and at the tendenoy of the Courts in some foreign countries to interfere with  suoh agreements. Put very briefly, the-desire of the oommeroial community is thatwhen the parties to a contract have agreed to refer futuredifferences arising under it to arbitration the Courts should stay proceedings in any aotion brought by either party, ifsatisfied that the subject is one whioh the parties have agreed to settle by arbitration and the arbitration can be carried out.CBET.  &apos;, 345  (23).C A B THE T.
     Within the last few days the International Chamber ofCommerce has passed a resolution approving the terms of theproposed Protoool, and I am in reoeipt of strong resolutionsfrom the Association of Chambers of Commerce and also fromImportant Chambers of Commerce like Manchester in favour ofadherence.     The Attorney-General informs me that in his opinion theeffect of the Protocol would be to give reasonable satisfaction to the desire of the commercial oommunlty as above described.     I do not suggest that the drafting of the Protoool isperfect or that it could not be olarified and improved if wehad only our own interests and legal system to oonslder.   TheLord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and also Mr.P.D.MoKinnon,K.C,(who throughout has been closely associated with the aotion ofthe League of Nations in this matter) have called my attentionto certain points of possible difficulty aa for example the risk that onoe proceedings were stayed in a foreign country the arbitration might be obstructively postponed or put offindefinitely by the other party or again a possible ambiguity inthe wording of Article 4 the removal of whioh if practicablewould improve the.draft from the British point of view.   Thepoint has been oarefully noted in case there should be anopportunity of securing an improvement in the wording of thisArtiole without imperilling the Protoool as a whole.    I am,however, advised that any attempt to re-open the draft for thispurpose would necessarily involve referring the whole Protooolback to the drafting Committee, and thus would not only oauBe a delay of a year, but would almost oertainly result in re-openingother and more important points whioh have been settled to oursatisfaction with great difficulty.   1, therefore,  recommendthat (unless a favourable opportunity should unexpectedlypresent itself for securing an amendment of Article 4 without
re-opehing any other questions) the British Delegate shouldaooept the Protoool and sign It as it stands, reserving theposition of the colonies as provided for in Artiole 8.     I should add that the acceptance of the Protoool wouldInvolve a slight amendment in Section 4 of the Arbitration Actbut I am advised that legislationfbr this purpose would be noncontroversial.
