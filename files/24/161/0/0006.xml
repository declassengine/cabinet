I 0 E.                (Report to the Cabinet).(Circulated hy the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)                On June 14  the  Irish Affairs  Committee  of  the  Cabinet,          received a Deputation of  Conservative members  of both Houses,,          introduced by lord Lansdowne,. on  the subject  of  &quot;Compensation  in          Ireland.   A Hots on  the  points raised  by  the  Deputation which          has been sent to  those who accompanied  Lord Lansdowne. for          their private information is&apos;  submitted  for the information of         &apos; the. Cabinet and I desire  to take  this opportunity of bringing          to the  notice of  my colleagues the  present position  of Irish          Compensation.                The general provision made  for the various classes of          compensation is sot out  in Command  Paper 184-4  which  was          circulated  in April last  and  a copy of  which  is  attached          hereto.   There is also  attached  for the Information of the          Cabinet a copy of a letter addressed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-        &apos;  merit to the-Provisional  Government  of Southern Ireland          on the  26th July, 1922.   (Command Paper 1736).Sg-TRUCB.        As.regards  the  operations of  the  Compensation  (Ireland)          Commission, tho-total number  of cases dealt with up  to          June 9th was 11,053.   Of these no  awards  were made  in          7,239 cases on-the&apos; ground that they were outside the          Commission&apos;e terms of reference;  and  in the  remaining 3,8l9,          the total amount  of  compensation  awarded was   2,873,987-
 At  the  present  time the  Commission is  dealing  with  cases at-  * &quot; the rate  of,  approximately,  600 a week.    The  progress that  is being made  by Sir Alexander  Wood Renton  and  his  colleagues  I3 cpen to no  criticism and it  seems probable that  the Commission&quot;will complete its labours and  review all the decrees and claims which fall  within its Terms  of Reference by  the  3lst March  1924. The point,  however,  on which dissatisfaction is  felt is the rate of progress  made by the Free State  Government  in paying these awards.      It  has  been impossible hitherto  to secure  regular returns of  payments made  by the  Free State Government  but this will  now be  remedied and the first of a series  of fortnightly returns will it  is hoped be  received  about  the middle -of  next month.   Up to the end of  April  the Free State Government had. paid 454&apos; of  the awards  of the Compensation Commission.    The total&apos;of compensation  involved is not available but the payment of 320 of  these  awards included in  a  Return up  to the. 3lst March last amounts to   600,000.  In addition 208 defended  decrees have been paid.    The  total number  of cases gazetted  for early payment in  the  Dublin Gazette on various dates up to April.loth last is 2.295&apos;.                                                &apos;      There are Inevitable delays in the payment of these monies owing to  the  necessary investigation of  Assignments,&apos;etc.,  but the discrepancy between  the  number of  &quot;Wood-Renton&quot;  Awards  and the number  of payments certainly gives ground  for complaint by the claimants who have naturally been  expecting payment at  a date shortly  following the gazetting of  their  award.  As a partial remedy  the Irish Grants Committee  have been empowered to  make advances  of a substantial nature,  not  only  on &quot;Wood /tenton&quot; Awards, but  also on  County Court decrees which have not yet been  revised  and upon claims which have  not yet  been heard.  65,000 has been  advanced in this.way  on &quot;Wood  Renton&quot; awards up to  June l6, and cases are being dealt  with as  they  arise.   In addition   30,000.  has been advanced in  post-truce cases, and  30,000 has been  granted,  or loaned without  security, in cases of  distress.                 -    0
Coiaaittee is valuable, it does not satisfy the holders of    .awards anxious to realise and re-invest the full amount due tothem.   Nothing short of prompt payment of the awards as they&apos;are issued :by:the Commission can be regarded as satisfactory. &apos;The Free State Government has stated that now that.the Compensa-tion Act is on the Statute Book a considerable amount of staff has become available for the machinery of payment and that theMinistry of Finance in Dublin hope that by the. end of this -monththey will have paid all awards bearing dates up to the end- ofMay.    This has been referred to in Parliament and was-reportedto the Deputation on June 14th.,   If this hope is fulfilled, itwill go far to allay the present uneasiness among supporters of the Government on the subject of pre-truce compensation.--if on the other hand it is not substantially fulfilled, and the&apos;Committee fear that at the end &quot;of June, there may still fee a very substantial number of April and May awards - unpaid, it is certainthat -very strong pressure will be brought on the Government to intervene, and it may well be necessary for.the Committee to&apos;recommend to the Cabinet some alternative method of settlement to the quarterly apportionment described on page 4 of ,command paper 1844, &apos;               .    .                :            .      In these circumstances I think that it. may-be desirableto place before the Cabinet at once, -very&apos;briefly., the possible alternative methods which occur &apos; to, them, in order that, if itshould be necessary to consider these in greater detail andreach a decision in July, my colleagues may have - already given &apos;some preliminary attention to the matter.      There are four methods by which the. prompt--payment of -the Commission&apos;^ awards, or such of them as are a matter&apos; oflegitimate interest to the British Government, could bo secured.              ..-&apos;,-            - 3 &apos;-
             (l)   The present arrangement (see page 4 of Command^          Papor 1844) under which the Pree State Government  are to          pay all the awards in the first instance and recover th6          British proportion by quarterly instalments could  be          varied by making the periodic settlement weekly or even          daily.              (2)  The present arrangement could by agreement with          the Pree State Government be reversed, so that the British&apos;          Government would be primarily responsible for all  payments          and would subsequently recover the Irish proportion from          the Pree State Government,             (3)   It could be suggested to the Pree State Government          that the Wood Renton Commission should be authorised, to pay          its own awards with funds supplied jointly by the  two          Governments, subject to quarterly adjustment on the basis          already laid down,             (4)   The Irish Grants Committee could be empowered to make       .-  advances to loyalists up to the full amount of the awards          held by them. ,             With reference to (4) it may be pointed out that among       other advantages it does not depend upon prior payment by the       Pree State Government or require the concurrence of that       Government, and that it Becures payment exclusively to persons       in whom the British Government has a legitimate interest.-TRUCE.      Since Command Paper 1844 was printed the Damage to       Property (Compensation) Bill has passed into law.             It will be impossible for some few months to examine      . the actual operation of the new Act and to decide whether       its previsions will, in fact, prove to be inequitable and       if so in what respects.   But the principal POINT6 on which
it is open to criticism are:-          (a) that It provides for part payment of compensation              in Bonds          (b) that,It specifically excludes consequential loss          (c) that, in certain cases a reinstatement condition .,              may be attached to an award.     As regards (a) it is understood that the Free State Govern-ment intends to issue bonds on such terms as will they hopemaintain them approximately at par.   These bonds will certainly be short term and will secure a fixed income of certainly notless than 4^$ of face value.   The poasibiiitity of the FreeState Government defaulting either on interest or redemption isa contingency which need not be considered untii it arises.It is obvious that In such an event a completely new situation with regard to the whole question of compensation would be created.     (b) Consequential loss has always been strictly limited bythe Courts to compensation arising directly out of the damage done.   It Is doubtful whether in the case of Irish loyalistsmuoh of the consequential loss la of this nature.   The greaterpart is probably loss of rent, compensation In respect of  nhichwas never recoverable; &apos; but lose of rent is, to. a,certain extent,met by the provisions&apos;of the new.Land Bill now before- the Ballunder which the landlord may recover 75$ of three years arrears of rent Including an immediate cash, payment of 75$ of one year&apos;srent payable on passing of the Act. ,       .- -     (c) The original clauses regarding Reinstatement were -considerably&apos;modified during the passage of the Bill through theFree.State Parliament,   The Court is now obliged, if it attaches.a Reinstatement condition to its award, to award a sum sufficientto restore the building adequately or to re-erect a similarbuilding.   Further the holder can now employ the amount soawarded to rebuild in any part of the Free State,
     There remains the danger  as  to  the interpretation  whichthe Courts  -^ay put on  the  provision  enabling them to attach afull reinstatement. condition in every case in which,  in the  ---rrrrZaopinion of the Judge,;, the  Injury  to  the building has Wterially-   Iprejudiced the economic welfare of the district.   The WoodRenton Commission of course vas similar power but the dangerof abuse is. obviously greater.where  the law is being administered by a number&quot;.of County - Court Judges instead of by a singlecommission. .  Any. provision for&apos; reinstatement must-leave largediscretionary -- power-to - the.- Court&quot;; - and - the equity of&apos; the provi-sion.therefore-depends to  a very  considerable extent upon themanner in which .it is  administered.    &apos;--&quot;-         &quot;:  .  . In this-connection it is  of-interest -to&quot;observe&apos;that in.the ,last ,1500 awards  issued by the Wood Rent on*&apos;Ccmmission acondition of reinstatement has been,  attached to a&apos;part of theaward In 119  cases or&apos;8/5  of the whole.  &apos;. The total&apos;amountawarded in  these 119  cases is   398;783, and of this sum 142,807, or  56,^ has  been  made subject to reinstatement.If these 1500. cases approximate to the&apos;average therefore,  itmay be assumed-that Z% of  the  total  sum (estimated at approxi-mately  10,000,000) awarded by the Commission will be subject.to reinstatement.-   &quot;The -power&apos;of  the Courts to&apos;impose conditionsas to- reinstatement under  the  new Act are only slightly &apos;c-&apos;iderthan those  of the  Commission;&apos;&quot;&apos;and&apos; if this power -is exercisedwith as-great&apos; moderation&apos;  by the Courts as by the Commission, no serious-hardship would appear  likely to-arise.&quot; :..v  .. ..  -:&quot;\       :         &apos; - - (Intld)  D.  &apos;&apos;--&apos;-.&apos; -&apos;-- &apos;   -Colonial Office,  .... 3rd July, - 19-23,

The following note upon the points raised by theDeputation which was received by the Irish Affaire Conmittee of theCabinet on June 14th, 1923, is circulated for their confidential information    .    (1) Defended decrees....   There seems to have been some confusion     at the Deputation between the position as regards defended     X^,-truce decrees and defended post truce, decrees.          As regards pre-truce decrees, it was agreed between     the two Governments in January 1922, that undefended decrees     .should be subject to review by a Commission to be jointly     appointed by the two Governments, and that the terms of     reference to the Commission should be jointly considered     and-agreed.   The terms of reference, as finally settled,     were published as a parliamentary Paper  (Cmd,1654) in May,     1922, and they contain a provision that  &quot;a case shall be     deemed -to have been undefended when the council of the     county or county borough in whose area the destruction or     injury occurred did not appear by counsel or solicitor in     opposition to the claim&quot;.   This definition has been on     many occasions referred to in Parliament and is repeated in     the footnote on page 4 of the Memorandum on Compensation     published in April last (Cmd,1844).   The exclusion from the     category of &quot;defended cases&quot;, therefore, of cases which    -were defended by the Rural or urban Council but not by the     County Council is in accordance with an agreement made     between the two Governments and published as long ago as     May 1922.          The agreement on the subject of the Terms of Reference     was of course made between the Provisional Government and
 Mr.Lloyd  george  Government;   and  the present Government need hardly  undertake the task of defending it  in every point, although  the  distinction between cases defended by a  County Council and those  defended by  sons  lesser  authority is not altogether unreal.   But however that may  be, it  is clear that. inasmuch  as it is  on these terms of reference that the Wood-Renton Commission (who have completed rather more than a quarter of their whole task) have been working, they could  not now&quot; be  altered unless there wa3 the gravest reason for proposing such an alteration.      As regards post-truce decrees, the  case is quite different. No question of excepting defended decrees, or any other decrees arises, the only question being: whether, in the case  of all or any  post-truce decrees,  the time within which an  appeal may be lodged  is to  be extended.  In the  Irish Compensation Bill as originally introduced, all post-truce decrees were made subject to a fresh right of appeal, either  by the  holder  of the decree or by the Minister of Finance.   In the Act however,  no such fresh right of appeal is accorded in any case in  which the existing&quot; right of  appeal has already been  exercised by the local authority;   in every other case however (i.e. in every &apos; case in whioh no appeal  had been made, or  an appeal had been made by the injured person and not  dafended by the local authority), another right of appeal, to be exercised  before August  12th,  is given:  if that right of apneal is not exercised by August 12th, the original decree stands and is payable in cash by the Free State Government.(2) Payment of^oodrflenton awards.   As soon as an a^ard is notified  by the Commission to  the Free State Government, the latter  publish the award in the Dublin Gazette in order that . notification  of charges  on the award may be made  to them.   The British Government hope  to learn early in  July from the Free State Government that all awards so published up  to the end of May  have  been paid,  and  that thereafter awards will be paid promptly  one  month in arrear;   and  they have good reason to                                                      expect
                                                            6..11expect that, if this hope is not completely fulfilled, at anyrate the great majority of such awards will have been paidby them.     To ask the Free State Government at the present moment for a nominal list of awards paid would be to divert thesmall staff of the Ministry of Finance from the moreimportant task of paying awards;  and if the hope above referret.to is fulfilled, such a list will be unnecessary as the DublinGazettes will supply the information.   If however it should appear early in July that this hope has not been fulfilled, theBritish Government will endeavour to obtain a.nominal list ofpayments made and a periodical return thereafter.     Colonel Pretyman Newman is mistaken in thinking thatthe sum of approximately  500,000 referred to by him as havingbeen paid to Lloyds was paid by the British Government.Inaccordance with the arrangement that all Wood-Renton awardsshall in the first instance be paid by the Free State Governmsnwho &quot;ill thereafter recover from the British Government so muchas is certified to be due by them, this sum was paid by theFree State Government - see page 4 of the White Paper on compensation.(3) Post-truce, plairas.Lord Besart&apos;s case,.,   It is undoubtedly the case that those who suffered injury shortly after the truce have been kept for a long time in great uncertainty asto the, manner  in which their claims would be dealt with.At the time  of the agreement on this subject between the t&quot;&apos;oGovernments  in January, 1922,  it was assumed that such oasescould and would be dealt with  in the ordinary way under the criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts:  and a number of decreesin respect of  such injuries were- in fact obtained from theCourts at about that time-.   Almost immediately afterwards the rebellion against the Free State broke out;  and it very soon                                                    became
                         - 4 -                                62became  apparent both  that the Courts were unable to functionand that the local authorities would be unable to bear the burdenof compensation.   In his letter  to the Provisional Governmentof July 26th, Mr.Churchill  recognised  that  some differentmethod  of meeting these  claims would be necessary;  and it wasnot until some months later that  the Free State Governmentwere  in a position to consider the matter and introduce the Bill*&apos;hich has now become  law.      If before the passing  of the Act, Lord Desart served noticeof his  claim in compliance  with the resolution passed by the dail  on November 1st, 1922,  or if after the passing of the Acthe serves notice in compliance with Section 4 of the Act, his claim will  be heard in  its  turn by the County Court Judge ofthe area in which the injury took place.            :  -      It is  submitted  that the processes of  law must necessarily be delayed  in a country  in  which  civil war  is in active progress;and it  is precisely because such  delay involves very considerablehardship on innocent  claimants that the Irish Grants Committeehas been authorised to make, and  does  very  frequently make,advances, on such claims,(4), Powers of the Irish Grants Committee,.,    Doubt was expressed  &apos;at the  Deputation as  to  whether the Committee has power to make advances in post-truce  claims where no decree has been obtained,The fact however is that the Committee has  power to make, and frequently  does make, such  advances -  advances of.  5,000,  3,000and  2,000  have OArite recently been made in three su&quot;.h cases.    ,,  It was also suggested  by the Deputation that the advances made  by the Committee were  so small that persons with claimsdid not care to apply for such advances.    The Committee hasalways  been alive to  the evils of making small advances againstcapital sums due, the result of which  is to compel the olaimantto live on  his capital.   Where the claim is for a.large sum theCommittee frequently  advances as  much  as  1,000 and in somecases considerably more.   The Committee are always ready to                                                        consider
consider applications for advances of substantial  sums whichare satisfied that good use can be made of such an advance,  anda number of loans of this nature have in fact been made.Commission  in appointing their assessors, who are 52 in number;and  in  every case those appointed by rir.Dowd.oll have beenapproved by Mr.Howell Thomas and vice-versa.   Neither theCommission  nor their assessors have anything to gain by keepii^jdo^n the amount  of the awards-.   It is inevitable that among the52 assessors there should be some who are less tactful than others;  and inasmuch as it is of yery great importance to thework of the Commission that as many cases as possible should besettled out of Court by agreement, the Commission are very anxious that cases of improper conduct or undue pressure byassessors should be brought to their notice.   Any such casestherefore which  come to the notice of members of the Deputationshould  be reported, with specific details enabling them to be identified, to the Colonial Office in order that they may bebrought to  the notice of the Commission.   Enquiry is beingmade into the case of Lord Dunalley quoted by Sir John Butcher.The  fact that the number of specific complaints brought to thenotice  of the Colonial Office is very small, and th&quot;t some ofthese proved to  be not well founded, suggests thvr, in fact theassessors have done and are doing their work very well.(6) Assistance for loyalists in Ireland.   It is true that theIrish Grants Committee is precluded by its&apos; terms of referencefrom assisting persons in Ireland who have no claim for compensation.    The problem is a difficult one;  but it isproposed that the laininter who, as the Deputation were informed,is shortly  going to Ireland shall include it, among the matters to be discussed  with Mr.Cosgrave.   Meanwhile the Committeewould be grateful if the Deputation would bring to the noticeof the  Irish Grants Committee any specific cases of realdistress among loyalists still resident in Ireland of which theymay  be  a^are,can be used as oapital rather than as income,  provided that theyGreat care has been taken by the
                         -6.                     ,.        64(?) AMiftiiOn fe^r,^,^ abating rights,.  As regards cre-truce decrees,  it  was  an essential part  of the agreement between the two Governments  which led to  the establishment of the Wood-Renton Commission that when that Commission was established not only should  undefended decrees be  subject to review by the Commission but in view of the  further agreement that defended deorees  should be paid in full by the Free State Government all olaims  against local  authorities in resoeot of the period covered  by  the  Commission should  be rendered unenforceable; and to this  extent therefore the Act merely carries out that  agreement.    So  far as the  claimant was concerned, the consideration which he received for the abolition tf his&apos;existing rights was payment by the Government instead of payment by the local authority.      As regards poat-truoe decrees,  it is to be observed that the Act does not  render these void.   What it does is to, provide that deorees which under  the Ualicioua Injuries Acts are final may be  appealed  against (if notice of appeal is given within three  months  of the  passing  of  the Act - i,e., before August 12th  Hext) either by the Minister of Finance or the applicant.   The consideration offered to the  claimant for this modification of his rights is the same  as in  the case of pre-truce decrees - namely payment by the Government instead of payment by the local  authority.      In both these  cases it must  be  remembered the present Government are not  responsible for the agreement,  though there is no doubt that  diversity of treatment between those who have obtained decrees  and those who have  not presents a certain difficulty.(8) Limitation of  compensation, to  actual damage.    Compensation for consequential damage was at all  times strictly limited under the old malicious and  Criminal Injuries Acts;   and it is believed that a proportion of the consequential losses suffered by loyalists will be to a  certain extent  covered by the                                                     provisions
Colonial Office.   1st July, 1923.provisions  in the new land Bill as to arrears of rent;  butundoubtedly it may be shown that this does not meet the case.The matter  however is not simple.      Lord Lansdowne  quoted the case of one of his tenants whowas driven  out of his farm, which was destroyed, and whose sonwas killed, and pointed out that he has no claim for compensationexcept  for  the death of his son and the destruction of his farmand machinery.   It  is a terrible case;  but it must be pointedout that it is not a case in whioh, so far as can be seen, the consequential loss is such that it oould have been the subjectof compensation under the old Act any more than it is under thenew,(9) The  Agreement of  January. j.922f  As promised in the House ofCommons by  the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for theColonies on June 25th, will be laid before both Houses ofParliament  at an early date.

IRISH  FREE  STATE.COMPENSATION  FOR  INJURY  TO  PERSONS                   AND PROPERTY.                   MEMORANDUM.    I. PEE-TRUCE  PERIOD-JANUARY  21ST,   1919,   TO                      JULY lira, 1921.                 A. INJURY TO THE PERSON.   It lias been agreed between the British  Government and  theGovernment of the Irish Free  State that each should be responsiblefor  the payment ,of  compensation in respect of injuries to its own supporters.   In pursuance of this agreement, the British Government has paidin full all decrees awarded to its own supporters for personal injuriesinflicted  during  this  period.   The  amount so expended  exceeds 2,600,000.   Cases in which no decrees have been awarded are being referred toMr. Howell Thomas and Mr. Dowdall (see LB. below) and the amountsawarded  by them are paid by the British Government.  Awardsamounting to  10,535 have been given in sixteen such cases.   It has been further agreed between the two  Governments  that incases not covered by the agreement already referred to (i.e., in cases in which the injured person was not clearly a supporter of one or theother Government) half the amount of the decree shall be paid by each government.  The  administrative  arrangements  for  carrying thisagreement into effect are at present under consideration between thetwo Governments.                   B. INJURY TO PROPERTY.   (a) Assessment. It  has been agreed between the British  Govern-ment and the Government of the Irish Free State that a.. commission should be established  consisting of  one  member  appointed  by  theBritish Government and one appointed by the Irish Government, witha Chairman who holds or has held high judicial office to be chosen byagreement,  and that this Commission shall have power to hear and determine all claims in respect of injuries to property during the period in question, and to review awards already given in undefended cases.   The members of this Commission are :     Sir Alexander Wood Benton (late Chief Justice of Ceylon, late        Vice-President of Egyptian Riots Indemnities Commission),        Chairman.    Mr. C.  J. Howell Thomas  (Deputy Chief  Valuer to the Board of        Inland Revenue), appointed by the British Government.    Mr. James C. Dowdall, appointed by the Government  of the        Irish Free State.
The terms of reference to  the Commission are :  &apos;   &quot; to enquire and determine and to report what compensation ought in   reason and fairness to be awarded in respect of destruction of or injuries   to property in Ireland, exclusive of Northern Ireland, sustained during   the period between the twenty-first day of January, one thousand nine   hundred and nineteen, and  the eleventh day of  July, one thousand nine   hundred and twenty-one, inclusive, being destruction or injuries of such a   nature as would give rise to  a claim for compensation under the enactments   relating to compensation for criminal or malicious injuries in Ireland, or   destruction  or  injuries which were the result of action  taken by order   of the military authorities  under martial law  and  would, but for the   existence of martial law, have been the subject of such a claim as  aforesaid,   both      &quot; (a) In cases where  no proceedings have been  instituted under the            said enactments  or, if instituted, have not resulted in a final            decree being given, and      &quot; (b)  On the application either of the British  Treasury or of the            Minister of Finance of  the Provisional  Government or the            Irish Free State, in undefended cases where such a final decree            has been given but the amount thereby awarded has not been            fully discharged.      &quot; With  power to  attach to an award of any sum payable in respect   of the destruction of or injury to any building or other permanent structure   a condition that the sum awarded (or  any part  thereof)  shall be applied   in reinstating the structure or in tho  construction in the same locality   of one or more substituted structures in any ease where it has  been shown   to the satisfaction of  the Commissioners that such destruction or injury   has materially  prejudiced the economic welfare  of the district:      &quot; And with power to summon as  witnesses such persons as may be   judged likely to afford information  upon the subject of the enquiry, and   also to call  for, have access to and  examine all such books, documents,   registers  and records as may afford the fullest information on  the subject,   and to enquire of and concerning tho premises by all other lawful  ways   and means whatsoever :      &quot; And with power to hear all persons and bodies directly or indirectly   interested in tho subject-matter of an  enquiry before  them either in   support of or in opposition to any application, and to permit any such   body  or  person to appear by  counsel or  solicitor  as may  be deemed   expedient:      &quot; And with power to visit and personally inspect such places as it   may be deemed expedient so to inspect for the more effectual carrying   out of the purposes aforesaid :      &quot; And with power to appoint such and so many persons as may be   deemed expedient to. be agents, investigators and assessors  for holding   local enquiries, assessing  damage in respect of applications which may be   made, and reporting  to the  Commissioners the result thereof, and to   delegate  to such agents, Investigators and assessors any of the powers of   the Commissioners:      &quot; And with power to limit the time within which applications may   be made, and  otherwise to regulate their own  procedure in  all respects   and the  procedure at such local enquiries as aforesaid,  and to enquire   and determine and report what sums, if any,  should be paid by way   of costs  in respect of proceedings before the Commissioners and (where   a final decree has been given as aforesaid) in respect of  the proceedings   resulting in or consequent upon such decree, and by whom and in what   manner the same are to be paid :      &quot; With an. obligation to  report to the British Treasury and  the   Minister of  Finance of the Provisional  Government or the Irish  Free
      State their opinions upon the matters submitted for consideration, and      with power to make interim reports from time to time to the British      Treasury and the Minister of Finance of the Provisional Government or      the Irish Free State.          &quot; For the purposes of these presents a case shall be deemed to have      been undefended when the council of the county or county borough in      wlrose area the destruction or injury occurred did not appear by counsel      or solicitor in opposition to the claim.&quot;    By  subsequent agreement between the two  Governments it has been decided that the British Treasury and the Minister of Finance of the Irish Free State shall be deemed  to have referred to the Corn- mission all cases which they are empowered to hear under paragraph (6) of the terms of reference above.    The total number of claims referred  to the Commission is 38,597.    Of these they have  dealt with 7,015.    Of the 7,015  claims  dealt  with  by the  Commission they have made  no award in 4,691  cases, on the ground that  the  claims were outside their terms of reference ;  and in the remaining  2,324 cases they have made awards amounting to  2,265,334.    The Commission are at  present dealing  with  cases at the rate of approximately 500 a week, and it is anticipated that they will have completed their work by March 31st, 1924.    (6) Payment. It has been agreed  between the two Governments that all def ended * decrees shall be paid in full, and that all such decrees and all awards by the Commission shall in  the first instance be paid by the Free State Government.    In pursuance of this agreement the Free State Government have paid 114 defended decrees amounting to  145,127, and have gazetted and are about to pay 234 further  defended decrees  amounting to approximately   50,000.  They have  paid  211 awards made by the Commission amounting to  281,004, and have gazetted and are about to pay 1,319 further awards amounting to  1,601,616.    In addition to these  payments, the Free State have purchased advances amounting to   552,000 made  to  claimants  by  various insurance companies ; and this sum should therefore be regarded as having been paid by the Free State Government to claimants in respect of  defended  decrees or in respect of  awards or prospective awards by the Commission.    (c) Apportionment of Payment between  the Two Governments. It has been agreed that the British Government shall refund to the Free State Government so much of the total amount  paid by the latter Government in respect  of awards made  by  the Commission as  was in the opinion of the Commission attributable  to damage done by the Forces of the Crown or their supporters.  In pursuance of this agree- ment the Commission will report at the end of each quarter in respect of the awards made  by them during that quarter in what shares the aggregate amount of such awards is  apportionable between the  two Governments, and on the  basis of this report the British Government will at the beginning of  each quarter refund to the Free State Govern-    *&quot; Defended&quot; decrees are decrees given in  cases in which the council ofthe county or county borough, in whose area the destruction or injury occurred,appeared by counsel or solicitor in opposition to the claim.
ment their  due proportion of the awards paid by the Free  StateGovernment during the preceding quarter, subject to a fixed deductionin respect of the damage done by adherents of Sinn Fein in  GreatBritain, which has been valued by  agreement at   1,000,000.  Thefirst payment by the British Government will be made in April, 1923,in respect of all awards paid by the Free State Government down to march 31st,  1923 ; and, on the assumption that payments will continue for three years, the quarterly deduction to be made from the sum dueby the British Government to the Free State  Government has been fixed  at  83,333 6s. 8d.   It has further been  agreed that in discharging its liability underthis  head the British Government shall be  entitled  to  take intoaccount the settlement,  from  time to time, of mutual cash liabilitiesbetween the two Governments.     II. POST-TRUCE  PERIOD-SUBSEQUENT  TO  JULY                           11TH, 1921.                  A.-INJURY TO THE PERSON.   (a) Members of the Forces  of the Crown. The Free State Govern-ment have agreed to pay in full all decrees awarded to  members ofthe British  Forces who have  been killed or injured  within the FreeState since July 11th, 1921, in  circumstances which amount to breaches of the truce entered into on that date.   In cases in which no decreeshave  been awarded, the Free State Government will accept liability for the  payment of such compensation as may be  awarded jointlyby Mr.  Howell Thomas and  Mr.  Dowdall.  In  pursuance of thisagreement Mr.  Howell Thomas and Mr. Dowdall have already  givenawards amounting to  11,500 in twelve such cases.   (6) Other Persons. The Free State Government have  appointed aCommittee,  to  be  called the  Compensation (Personal Injuries) Com-mittee, consisting of HisPIonour Judge Johnston, K.C. (County court judge of Counties Monaghan and Louth) and two medical practitioners(Dr. T.  Hennessy and Dr. H.  Kennedy).  The terms of  reference tothe Committee are as  follows  :          I. The Committee shall receive, investigate and consider appliea-      instructions for compensation presented by any person who has suffered loss by      reason  of having been injured in his person or by the dependents of any      person  who has died in consequence of having  been so injured in any of     -the following cases, occurring since the 21st January, 1919, namely:          (1) Where the injury was an injury to which the Criminal Injuries               Acts  would have been applied by  the  Criminal Injuries               (Ireland) Act, 1919, as  amended by the Criminal Injuries               (Ireland) Act, 1920, had these Acts remained in force.         (2) Where the injured person was or was likely to be excluded from               the benefit of the Criminal Injuries Acts as so applied by reason               only of the injury having been inflicted by members  of the               British  military  or police forces.         (3) Where the injury was sustained without default on  the part of               a person being a non-combatant in the course of belligerent               action between the British forces and the Irish National forces,               or in the course of operations by the National  forces against               persons engaged,in armed rebellion against tho Government
               of Saorstat Eirearui whether before or after  the passing of               the Constitution.          II. The Committee will recommend to the Minister of  Finance      what sums should in reason and fairness be paid in the several oases above      mentioned, regard being had to (inter alia) the actual earning capacity      of the injured person prior to the injury and to the impairment of earning      capacity attributable to the injury and to the actual extent of dependency      of dependents upon the deceased  person prior to the death or injury of      the deceased person, and to any effective provision made by the deceased      person for his dependents by way of insurance or otherwise          III.&apos; The Committee shall in general recommend awards by way of      lump sum, but shall also recommend in the alternative monthly or quarterly      allowances in cases of injury considered -likely to be permanent.   The      payment of a periodical allowance may be recommended to commence      on the 1st day of April, 1923, but a payment of a sum in the nature of      arrears, but not exceeding the amount of one year&apos;s arrears, may be also      recommended,         1IV. The Committee shall not recommend an award in any of the      following cases :           (1) Cases eligible for any award under any Act making provision for               army pensions.          (2) Cases in which a final decree under the Criminal Injuries  Acts               was obtained prior to the  12th February, 1922 ; and          (3) Cases in which the  British  Government  have undertaken full               liability.                     B. INJURY  TO PROPERTY.   (a) During the  period July  11th,  1921, to March Mh, 1923. Compensation for injury to property  during this period is providedfor by Part II of the Damage to Property  (Compensation) Bill whichis at present  before the Free State Parliament.  The provisions of thisPart of the Bill  may be briefly  summarized as follows :     (i) Part II  of the  Bill applies  to  all injuries to property  which           occurred during the  period  specified above and  in respect           of which compensation  could have been given  under  the           Criminal Injuries Acts.    (ii) Application for compensation  (if not already so &quot;made) is to           be made in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal           Injuries Acts, and may be made at any time within three           months of  the passing of the Bill.  In  addition to such           application, every  applicant is to serve such notice in such           form and  upon such persons as the  Minister of Finance           shall  prescribe.    (iii) Any decree already awarded may be reviewed upon application          . (to be made within three months of the passing of the Bill)           by the Minister of  Finance or by the applicant.    (iv) No compensation is to  be awarded in respect of consequential           damages nor in respect of certain articles,  such as jewellery,           coins, banknotes, &amp;c.    (v) A reinstatement  condition  may in certain  circumstances be           attached  to  so much  of  any  decree as  relates  to   the           destruction of,  or injury to, a building.
    (vi) All deorees to which a reinstatement condition is  attached,          and all decrees not exceeding  500 are to be paid in cash          by the Minister of Finance ; in the case of all other decrees,          the first  500 and half of the excess above  500 up to a          maximum of  2,000 is to be paid in cash and the balance in          securities,  which the Minister of Finance is by the  Bill          empowered to issue.    (vii)  Application may be made  for compensation for loss arising          out of theft, looting or requisition committed by persons          acting or purporting to act on behalf of  any organization          engaged in  armed  resistance to the Provisional or Free          State Government or by  persons belonging to or acting or          purporting to act  on behalf of any unlawful or seditious          association,  and also for  compensation for the destruction          of or damage to any property in  the course of or as an          incident in  a conflict  between  the  armed  forces  of the          Provisional  or Free State  Government and any persons          offering  armed resistance to  such forces.  Upon hearing          such application the Judge, if satisfied that the applicant          has suffered such loss, destruction,  or damage, shall report          to the Minister of Finance what sum in his opinion  would          fairly compensate the applicant-for such loss.            NOTE. This provision affords no legal right to compensa-          tion for such loss,  but is merely intended to supply the          information necessary  for the  impartial distribution of          such  ex gratia compensation as may be available.   The          existing Criminal Injuries Acts provide  no  compensation          for loss of this kind.    (viii) Evidence may be taken  on commission  outside the Free          State if the Judge is satisfied that there are substantial          reasons other than expense for dispensing  with the personal          attendance of any necessary witness.   (b) During tJie period subsequent to March 2,0th, 1923. subsequent to March 20th, 1923, the existing Criminal Injuries Acts will apply,subject to the repeal of the Acts of 1919 and 1920.      III. ASSISTANCE  RENDERED  BY  THE  BRITISH         GOVERNMENT IN CASES OF HARDSHIP.   It is inevitable that there should be delay in the assessment and payment of compensation  (both in respect of pre-truce and in respectof post-truce injuries), and in order to alleviate as far as possible anyhardship arising out of such delay, as well as to afford assistance torefugees from Ireland who have no claims for compensation, the IrishDistress Committee set up by the  late Government  in  May, 1922,under the Chairmanship of Sir Samuel Hoare, M.P., and subsequently
of Lord Eustace Percy,  M.P., has been  reconstituted as &quot; the IrishGrants Committee,&quot; with the following terms of reference :       &quot; to recommend to the Secretary of State for the Colonies what grants or      loans should be made to refugees from Ireland and what advances should      be made to claimants for compensation under the Criminal and Malicious      Injuries Acts or other legislation for the time being in force in Ireland,      and to advise the Secretary of State generally upon the position of such      persons.&quot;   Lord Eustace Percy remains the Chairman of this Committee.   All  applications to the Committee should be  addressed to &quot; TheSecretary, Irish Grants Committee, 2, Queen Anne&apos;s  Gate Buildings,S.W. 1.&quot;                                  COLONIAL  OFFICE,                                            Irish  Branch,                                         38,  Old  Queen Street, S.W. 1.April Wi, 1923.

COMPENSATION   FOR   MALICIOUS    INJURIES   IN                          IRELAND.Letter to  the Provisional Government.                                        DOWNING  STBEET,                                                26$ July, 1922.SIR,   His Majesty&apos;s Government have lately given anxious considerationto certain insistent questions of difficulty  arising out of the arrange-ments made for the payment of compensation to persons who have suffered in Southern Ireland injuries that would normally have entitledthem to  compensation  under  the  Criminal Injuries Acts.   they feel sure that the same urgent problems must have forced themselvesupon the attention of  the Provisional Government.  They desire  me,therefore, to communicate with you fully on the subject.   2. As the outcome  of an agreement between the two governments in January  last, the  Compensation (Ireland) Commission has beenestablished under the  Chairmanship  of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline to-deal with cases of  malicious injury to property sustained between january 21st,  1919, and July 11th, 1921.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentunderstand that nine  cases of considerable variety  have been heardand decided by this Commission, and that these have created  pre-cedents which should lead to the settlement, without difficulty  andprobably without formal hearing of a much greater number.  Theyunderstand also that steps have already been taken by the Commission,with the help of  the  Provisional Government, for  the appointmentof agents who will investigate outstanding cases locally, and  will beempowered to settle them, without delay in so far as the compensation to be awarded may be  agreed.   This  procedure is entirely in accord with the understanding  reached in January last.  On the other hand the  inevitable delay in  starting to dispose of  claims on this agreedsystem has naturally caused apprehension and sometimes hardshipamong  those whose claims await settlement.   While the two Govern-ments share the ultimate responsibility for meeting the financial chargeinvolved, the immediate power  of resolving  those anxieties must  inthe circumstances rest  primarily with the Provisional Government.They have undertaken to pay in the first instance awards made by theCommission or arising ;.out of decrees previously given, by the courts in defended cases, and they alone can secure to the Officers of the Crownfacilities for the prompt and unhampered performance of their duties. His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the fullest assistance is being given to the Compensation Commission by the Provisional Government. They desire,  however,  to be in a position authoritatively to  relieve the anxiety of those who from time to time approach them as jointly
Tesponsible  with the Provisional Government  for the  performance of the January agreement.  They would, therefore, welcome an earlyofficial assurance that payment has actually been made in all cases that have matured  for payment and will be made in outstandingcases as these are.determined  or agreed.   They would also be glad ofa like assurance as to the progress of the work of local investigation.   3. It  was also agreed  in January last  that  claims  in  respect ofmalicious. injuries, whether to persons or property,  sustained afterJuly 11th, 1921, should be dealt with in the usual way by the  county courts and discharged by the local authorities.   That  decision  wasreached in the hope  that a resumption of normal civil life in  ireland would allow such claims to be readily presented by the individual,heard in the course of ordinary business by  the Court,  and paid by thelocal authorities within whose  areas the injuries had been committed.In practice this resumption of peaceful life has been delayed by  personsacting in defiance of the Provisional Government, whose challenge toits authority has recently, after long forbearance, been  met by forceof arms.  From  this delay have followed two  consequences  vitallyaffecting the arrangement  made  in January for the compensation ofpersons who have sustained injuries since  the Truce  of July  11th oflast year.   4. The most striking of these consequences has lain  in the whole-sale destruction of Irish property, the numerous injuries to Irish  citizenswhich have been inflicted during the fighting which began a month ago  and is in progress at the  date of this  despatch.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment observe that  an official notice  was  published  in the dublin Gazette of July 11th, inviting those,  who have sustained loss totheir property on or since June 27th in the course of the military opera-tions of the National Army, to lodge with the Provisional Governmentparticulars of their claims.  They infer from this  notice  that the Pro-visional Government have been moved to contemplate the settlementof this large body of claims on a national rather  than on a local basis.While, however,  the responsibility for meeting these claims to com-pensation must rest upon the Irish Government, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment cannot divest themselves of a duty to see that such claims are met  equitably and as promptly as inevitable difficulties allow.  Theywould, therefore, be  glad if the Provisional Government would inform them fully and authoritatively of the measures which they are adoptingto meet these exceptional claims in respect of injuries whether to person or property.   5. A  second  consequence  of  the  delay in the return  to  normalconditions in Southern Ireland has also engaged the anxious considera-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   A number of cases  have come totheir notice of persons who have suffered malicious injury to  person and  property since July 11th of last year, but who have  been deterredor prevented by the very causes which led up to the recent fightingfrom prosecuting their lawful claims in the normal way.  In some suchcases, though  notices have been lodged, the Courts have been unable
to sit and deal with them, in others the injured party has been deterred&apos;from giving notice of claim for fear of prejudicing thereby,  before-order should be restored, the welfare or safety of himself or of kinsmenwho have remained in Ireland.   Prominent among these latter cases.are those of men lately serving  in the Eoyal Irish Constabulary whohave been murdered or otherwise injured  in person or property by;criminals inspired by motives of revenge  towards their victims andill-will towards  the Provisional Government.&quot;  In  this&apos; matter also-His Majesty&apos;s  Government feel that they have alike inalienable respondsibility.&apos;  They are led to  believe, by  the indication of policy&apos;con-tained in the published notice of July 11th as  well as by the prompt and considerate answer made to their representations of May 13thon behalf of persons who have been compelled to flee from Ireland, thatthe Provisional Government will not have been slow to take such cases.into account and  to  consider whether  it  may not  be necessary  to-devise some special procedure for dealing with them, in order to securethe end  upon which the two  Governments reached  agreement lastJanuary.  They hope that  the  Provisional Government may, there-fore, already be in a position to indicate  to them some special and effective measure for dealing with such cases,  so that they may in their turn be enabled to re-assure those who have appealed to them in respectof injuries suffered since the Truce but otherwise than in the course ofthe recent open fighting.    6. I am to add that His Majesty&apos;s  Government will be happy to-consult immediately with representatives  of the Provisional Goverh-ment should it appear that such consultation would  accelerate a solu-tion of these urgent difficulties.  They propose to lay the terms of this letter before  Parliament in due course as an indication of their policyin reply  to the many petitioners who have urgently approached themand to whose losses and sufferings its enquiries relate.  They hope to-receive the reply of the Provisional Government in a form which will.enable it to be laid before Parliament.

COMPENSATION   FOR   MALICIOUS   INJURIES    IN                          IRELAND.Letter to  the Provisional Government.                                        DOWNING  STREET,                                                26* July, 1922.SIR,   His Majesty&apos;s Government have lately given anxious considerationto certain insistent questions of difficulty  arising out of  the arrange-ments made for the payment of compensation to persons who have suffered in Southern Ireland injuries that would normally have entitledthem to  compensation  under  the  Criminal  Injuries Acts.   they feel sure that the same urgent problems must have forced themselvesupon the attention of  the Provisional Government.  They desire  me,therefore, to communicate with you fully on the subject.   2. As the outcome  of an agreement between the two governments in January  last, the  Compensation (Ireland)  Commission has beenestablished under the  Chairmanship  of Lord Shaw of Dnnfermlme todeal with cases of  malicious injury to property sustained between january 21st, 1919, and July 11th, 1921.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentunderstand that nine  cases of considerable variety  have been heardand  decided by this Commission, and that these have  created  pre-cedents which should lead to the settlement,  without difficulty  andprobably without formal hearing of a much greater number.  Theyunderstand also that steps have already been taken by the Commission,with the help of the  Provisional Government, for  the  appointmentof agents  who will investigate outstanding cases locally,&apos;and  will beempowered to settle them without delay in so far as  the compensation to be awarded may be agreed.   This  procedure is entirely in accord with the understanding reached in January last.  On the other hand the  inevitable delay in  starting  to dispose of claims on this agreedsystem has naturally caused apprehension and sometimes hardshipamong  those whose claims await settlement.   While the two Govern-ments share the ultimate responsibility for meeting the financial chargeinvolved,  the immediate power of resolving those anxieties must inthe  circumstances rest primarily with the Provisional  Government.They have undertaken to pay in the first instance awards made by theCommission or arising out of decrees previously given by the courts in defended oases, and they alone can secure to the Officers of the Crown facilities for the prompt and unhampered performance of their duties.His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the fullest assistance is being given to the Compensation Commission by the Provisional Government. They  desire, however, to be in a position authoritatively to relieve the anxiety of those who from time to time approach them as jointly
responsible  with the Provisional Government  for  the  performance of the January agreement. , They would, therefore, welcome an. early.official assurance that payment has actually been made in  all cases that have matured for  payment and will be  made in  outstandingcases as these are determined or agreed.  They would also be glad of..a like assurance as to the progress of the work of local investigation.  .   3. It  was also agreed in  January last  that claims  in respect ofmalicious injuries,  whether to persons or property, sustained, afterJuly 11th, 1921, should be dealt with in the usual way by the county courts and discharged by the local authorities.   That decision  was.reached in the hope that a resumption of normal civil life in  ireland would allow such claims to  be readily presented by the individual,heard in the course of ordinary business by  the Court, and paid by thelocal authorities within whose areas the injuries had been committed.In practice this resumption of peaceful life has been delayed by personsacting in defiance of the Provisional Government, whose challenge toits authority has recently, after long forbearance, been met  by forceof arms.  From  this delay have followed two consequences vitallyaffecting the arrangement  made  in January for the compensation ofpersons who have sustained  injuries since  the  Truce of July 11th oflast year.                                   ...          .,..  .. /   L The most striking of these consequences has lain in the whole-sale destruction of Irish property, the numerous injuries to Irish citizenswhich have been inflicted during the fighting which began  a month.ago  and is  in progress at the date of this  despatch.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment observe that an official notice  was  published in the dublin Gazette of July 11th, inviting those,  who have sustained loss totheir property on or since June 27th in the course of the military opera-tions of the National Army, to lodge, with the Provisional  Governmentparticulars of their claims. They infer from this notice that  the Pro-visional Government have been moved to  contemplate the settlementof this large body of claims on a national rather than on a local basis.While, however,  the responsibility for meeting  these claims to com-pensation must rest upon the Irish Government, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment cannot divest themselves of a duty to see that such claims are met equitably and as promptly as inevitable difficulties  allow.  Theywould, therefore, be glad if the Provisional Government would inform them fully and authoritatively of the measures which they are adoptingto meet these exceptional claims in respect of injuries whether to person or property.   5. A second  consequence of the delay in the return to normalconditions in Southern Ireland has also engaged the anxious considera-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  A number of cases have come totheir notice of persons who have suffered malicious injury to person and property since July  11th of last year, but who have been deterredor prevented by the very causes which led up to the recent fightingfrom prosecuting their lawful claims in the normal way.  In some such^cases, though notices have been  lodged, the Courts have been unable
to sit and deal with them, in others the injured party has been deterred&apos;from giving notice . of claim for fear of ^prejudicing thereby, before-order should&apos;be restored, the welfare or safety of himself or:of kinsmenwho. have remained in Ireland.   Prominent among these latter oases,are those of men lately serving  in the Royal Irish Constabulary whohave been murdered or.otherwise, injured in person or. property.by.criminals inspired by motives of revenge towards their victims and&apos;ill-will, towards  the. Provisional Government.  In, this matter alsoHis Majesty&apos;s  Government, feel that they have alike inalienable respoh-ability.:  They are led to; believe,, by the indication of policy conrV&apos;tained in the published notice of July 11th as well, as by the prompt and  considerate  answer made to their representations of  May 13thon behalf of persons who have been compelled to flee from. Ireland,; that.the Provisional Government will not have been slow to take  such cases:into account and to  consider whether it may not be necessary  to:devise some special procedure for dealing, with, them, in order to securethe end  upon which, the two  Governments  reached  agreement lastJanuary.: They  hope that  the  Provisional Government  may,  there--fore, already be  in a position to indicate to them some special and effective measure for dealing with such cases, so that they may in their turn&apos;be enabled tore-assure those who have appealed to them in respectof injuries suffered since the Truce but otherwise than in the course of&apos;the recent open fighting.   6. I am to add that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be happy to-consult immediately with representatives of the Provisional  Govern-ment should it appear that such consultation would accelerate a solu-tion of these urgent difficulties.  They propose to lay the-terms of this letter before Parliament in due course as an^ indication of their  policyin; reply  to the many petitioners who have urgently approached themand to whose losses and sufferings its enquiries relate.  They hope to-receive the reply of the Provisional Government in a form  which will.enable it to be laid before Parliament.                        I am, etc..
