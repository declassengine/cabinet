A DOCUMam 15 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BBITAHHIC MAJESTY1S &amp;OVSRNMEIT)ICj E T       CABIH E T.COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRS.    COUNTY COURTS BILL.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor,     covering Draft Bill.     This Bill is intended to give effect to suoh ofthe recommendations of the County Court Staff Committee(Cd. 1049 of 1920) as are praotioable,  having regard to thechange in conditions since their Report.     The Committee was appointed in July 1919 by LordBirkenhead.   It was presided over by Mr. Justice Swift and reported in October 1920.  It was established for two mainreasonsj-       1. To deal with the oase of the  Registrars  of          County Courts whose position  had  bien gravely          affected by the War,  and       2. To deal with the grievances of the Clerks  and          Bailiffs employed in the Courts.1*   Registrars.   The system upon whioh they areemployed and paid is very oomplioat%d.   With a few exceptionsthey are dependent for their remuneration on the amount of fees taken in their respeotive  Courts.   Their remunerationis variable  from year to year and as  between one Registrarand another  the amount received differs,  without bearingany reasonable relation to the  amount of work done.   SomeRegistrars were greatly under-remunerated;  and  otheiP greatlyover-remunerated.  They are not subject  to  any retiring age.Many of them carry on private practice  as aolioitors  as  wellas the duties of the Registrar,
          This- system,-is, in^jrany respects, lextraragarxt^. and. fo^tl&apos;nmder-it .the Registrar - a judicial officer-having an interest inthe profits of his court - can affect his income by the mannerIn which he exeroises his judicial discretion, etc., and is a ,judge of the cases which his competitors bring to his court andthe officer to tax their bills.          The War destroyed the revenue upon which both theTreasury and the Registrars depended, to suoh an extent that theTreasury were obliged to pay both th Registrars and to Clerkssums by way of War Bonus.                                   &quot;          The Swift Committee recommended that Registrars shouldbe paid fixed salaries, and that the proportion of whole-timeRegistrars should be increased.  Subsequently a Coxaitt-?-/ enOounty Court Pees has made recommendations, for the simplificationand&apos; increase of fees which cannot be carried out without legisla-tion and without a change of system.;  In addition a scheme of re-organisation has been completed to provide a fixed salary forevery Registrar in lieu of his present variable remuneration.         .rThe Bill does not contain the details of this arrange-ment,  but it makes such modifications in the existing law as willenable effect to be given to it; imposes a retiring age uponfuture entrants or upon those now already in office who exercise the option to aooept the Bill; and offers favourable terms of superannuation to those to whom this retiring age applies.          The proposals of the Bill so far as the Registrarsare concerned, will result in very substantial immediate economiesamounting to  25,000, in addition to the increased revenue fromthe proposed new fees, and as years go on the amount of thoseeoonomies will increase.  The principle.is that the State takes the risk of loss and in exchange takes a larger proportion ofthe profits.  Tho profit is at present increasing and seems likelyto increase.  If in any year conditions similar to those arisingfrom the War were to recur, the State would be involved in atemporary loss, but not in  such a loss as has been imposed uponthe State by the emergency measures which the War rendered necessary.                   -2-
       Hie Registrars Association accept the proposals of the  Bill  and the scheme of reorganisation.  In its application to particular Registrars how in bffice a certain degree of flexibility will he necessary, and some may grumble at the proposals,, but speaking broadly; the Bill as between the Departments concerned on the one hand and the. Registrars on the other is&apos; an- agreed Bill.       2*  The Clerks and Bailiffs are technically the servants of the Registrar by whom they are appointed and paid.   Their remuneration comes from the gross sum received by the Registrar in fees,  or from a sum called &quot;Clerk HireAllowance&quot; granted to the Registrar out of the County Courts Vote.   Some are employed for their whole time upon the work of the County Court in offices of Registrars who also give their whole time to the Service;   some whole time,under Registrars who do not give their whole time;  some in partupon the. work of the Court and in part in the private practice of the Registrar. &apos;  Their salaries are in most cases far too low.   lo retiring age is imposed upon them nor is there any security gf tenure, or any fixed scale of salaryapplicable to them,  nor any provision for their old age. In the case of the  Clerks  who are employed whole time under        iwhole time Registrars and are in effect.whole time servants of the State,  these facts  have long*been recognised as constituting a grievance.        The result,  apart  from the hardship, has ..been much inefficiency and extravagance,    Aged clerks  frequently remain in the service after they have ceased to render service commensurate with  their salaries, thus  constituting a hidden non-effective charge.        These hardships and inefficiencies  came into prominence when the financial system broke  down under the strain of War.   The Registrars,  who were themselves  heavy losers, could not pay to the Clerks anything in respect of                          3. -
       The Registrars Association accept the proposals ofthe Bill and the scheme of reorganisation.  In its applicationto particular Registrars now in office a certain degree of flexibility will he necessary, and some may grumble at the :proposals,, hut speaking broadly, the Bill as between theDepartments concerned on the one.hand and the. Registrarson the other is&apos; an agreed Bill.       S;V  The ;Clerks and Bailiffs are technically the servants of the Registrar by whom they are appointed and paid.    Their remuneration comes from the gross sum receivedby the Registrar in fees,  or from a sum called &quot;clerk HireAllowance&quot; granted to the Registrar out of the County CourtsVote.    Some are employed for their whole time upon the workof the County Court in offices of Registrars who also give their whole time to the Service;   some whole time,underRegistrars who do not give their whole time;. ,.some in partupon the work of the Court and in part in the private practice of the Registrar. &apos;  Their Salaries are in most casesfar too low.  No retiring age is imposed upon them nor is there any security of tenure, or any fixed scale of salaryapplicable to them, nor any provision for their old age.In the case of the Clerks who are employed whole time under        iwhole tiijie Registrars and are in effect whole time servants of the State, these facts have long been recognised as constituting a grievance.        The result, apart from the hardship, has been much inefficiency and extravagance.    Aged clerks  frequentlyremain in the service after they have ceased to renderservice commensurate with their salaries, thus constituting a hidden non-effective charge.        These hardships and inefficiencies came intoprominence when the financial system broke down under the strain of War.   The Registrars, who were themselves -heavylosers, could not pay to the Clerks anything in respect of
the increase in the cost of living.  It was&apos; impossible to withhold from the Clerks War Bonuses similar to those paidto other permanent and temporary State Servants.   TheTreasury had therefore to assume this burden, and thesystem broke down altogether.        The Treasury and the Lord Chancellors department were thus forced to the view that Clerks employed whole time.in. the offices of whole time Registrars, and whole timeClerks engaged upon work which could be clearly distinguished from that of the Registrars private business ought to beestablished as Civil Servants upon a definite scale and given the benefits of superannuation, and at the same time that the working of the system should, he controlled more closely by the Comity Courts Department (now a branch of  theLord Chancellors Department).        The Bill enables effect to be given to theseproposals.    It also provides for the case of clerks now  inthe Service.   Clerks generally will be  placed upon a definitescale of salary and will retire at the  age of 65.    those now over 50 will,  however,  be permitted to remain for notmore than 15 years.    All under 55 if reasonably fit for employment  will be established.    Those over 65 who are nowredundant,  that is to say,  whose places would not  have tohe filled if they died or left  the service and those over 70,whether redundant or not, will  be retired immediately.These men will each receive a gratuity equal roughly to twoweeks1 salary for each years service,  with a maximum of  twoyears salary.    Those who being over 55 cannot he  established,Will upon retirement receive gratuities of three-quarters ofthat amount.        Proposals will involve  an immediate expenditureof  22,000 in the first year in excess  of the presentexpenditure,  by reason of the amount necessary for thegratuities and immediate.increases in pay of Clerks and.                       4.
Baliffs.   (The  pay would have to be increased in&quot;any event).In future  years bhe cost of the.Registrars,  Clerks andBaliffs will  approximate very closely indeed to the presentexpenditure  of   555*000;  on the other hand there will be alargely  increased  revenue.    The scheme represents anagreement  between  the Departments concerned and the Associationof Clerks  and Baliffs.    All concerned are satisfied that theterms offered are  both the  maximum and the minimum of what can reasonably  be  offered and accepted.    Individual agedClerks may object  but every such Clerk who has approached theLord Chancellor has,  it is  believed,  been induced to see thathis interests have been safeguarded.        It is of urgent importance that this Bill should be passed into  law at the earliest moment possible.   The arrangementhas been made upon the basis of the takings in the year 1922.  Thetakings  in the  year 1923 will be larger than those of 1922 e.nd ifthe settlement  does not receive  Parliamentary sanction duringthe present  calendar year,  Registrars will be able to reopennegotiations in the light of the new figures.   Many thousands of pounds  have  been already lost by the failure to settle uponthe 1921 f^-jures.    Every year that passes will make the settle-ment more  costly until it may become so costly that it cannot beeffected.    As  regards the Clerks also, an early settlement is urgent.    At present many aged men are serving uncSer thearrangement  already described.   As they become too infirm to goto the office they must be struck off the staff list, and theyhave no other resource but the workhouse.   low that public attention  has been drawn to the matter by the long negotiation?ery grave scandal would result if any number of these cases were to occur.    Members of Parliament of all parties are inclined to take an interest in the matter and to put down questions  to Ministers upon it.
        The remaining provisions of the Bill - Slauses7, 8 and 9 - deal  with other matters.        Clause 7 enables a fee to &quot;be taken upon proceedings under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.    This Clause isintended to carry into effect a recommendation of the geddes Committee and of the County Court Pees Committee,and has the assent of the Home Office.        Clause 8 makes a technical amendment of the lawwith reference to  ejectment actions-        Clause 9 makes certain non-controversial amendments in matters of machinery.
