I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the following amendments which, after further consultation with the Secretary of State for India, I desire tomake in the memorandum on Indians in Kenya circulated on the 20th July, 1923(C.P.-334 (23)).

Amend the paragraph to. read  as follows  :.     10. Conclusion.        In conclusion, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to record that the decisions    embodied  in this memorandum have only been  taken after an exhaustive review    of  the  several complicating factors  which have  led to the present unhappy    controversy.  Their constant endeavour throughout their deliberations has been    to  relate  the principles which must  govern the  administration of a British    Colony in Tropical  Africa to the wider  considerations of general Imperial    policy  as enunciated in the Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1921.  It    is regretted  that on certain material points it has  not been possible to meet    the wishes of the Government of India,  whose views have received the fullest    consideration from His Majesty&apos;s Government  at the instance of the Secretary    of State for India.  It is not to be expected that issues so grave can be composed    to  the  immediate satisfaction  of the  several interests concerned,  but  His    Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the decisions now taken, resting as they do    on  the broad basis  of the British trusteeship for  the - African, provide  an    equitable  adjustment of those  interests.  It is the confident expectation of His    Majesty&apos;s Government that if  the whole matter is viewed in its true perspective,    decisions so based will  be accorded general acceptance, and it is their earnest    hope that  a sincere  effort will be made to  restore  in  Kenya  that  spirit of    co-operation  and goodwill so essential to its welfare and development.[10371]
