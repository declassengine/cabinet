dmo             IMPERIAL   ECONOMIC   CONFERENCE.         Oversea  Settlement  within  the  Empire.    Before  the  Imperial Conference meets, it is necessary that I decision should ba  arrived  at with regard to the organisationJ......Ife of the  Oversea Settlement  work.   I  submitted a  memorandum I the Secretary  of State  on  this matter  at the  end of  June,  inIjcb. I suggested that the  Oversea Settlement Office  should beIjjmanently  transferred to  the  Department of Overseas Trade,  and1wuld be  moved to the neighbourhood of Old Queen Street at anISly date.    It  Is an impossible task  attempting to  run sstisfac-lily two departments situated at considerable  distances  from each  BT, and the problem of Oversea Settlement demands  a  specialSbWt of  personal attention.    I think I ought  to mention that thisI plposal is  not agreed to by  the Vice Chairman of the Oversea Settle- 1    Committee.   Turning  to the progress of  the work,  the position may  be  summed  very briefly as follows: lu)A,    So far, Canada has  shewn small  disposition  to co-operate 1 the schemes concluded with  her are  negligible.,    The difficul- p, I believe,  are  mainly political,  but it must be borne in mind  t Canada  has had serious economic troubles in the  past  two or  ee years  which have,  no  doubt,  prejudiced the farming class against  &apos; idea of  the Government promoting the  Influx  of further settlers.  the other hand, without co-operating under the Act,  she is at the  lent taking  as  many migrants  as Australia&apos;but  probably a consid-  bie proportion of  these are  artisans or industrial rather than  cultural workers.                            AUSTRALIA/
 AU3TR42JA.  - Auatralia-Jiaa shown far  the greatest  seal and energy  of any of the Dominions.    In addition  to an agree- ment with the Commonwealth for assisted, passages,  land settle- ment schemes have been entered into with Western Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales.   Unfortunately, the progress being made  under these schemes is disappointing, but they are still in their infancy. NEW ZBAIAHD.   lew Zealand doea not afford much scope formigration, but Sir James Allen told me that they hoped tobe able to take 1,000 settlers per month.    This is about all that they can absorb.SOUTH AFRICA,.  The Union Government made it clear at the Conference of 1921 that  owing to the limited field for whitelabour in South Africa,  they were precluded from co-operation on the lines contemplated by the other Dominions.NEWFOUNDLAND.  Natural conditions render Newfoundland relativelyunimportant.   3.    It seam fairly clear that some of  the  most important of the  business relating to oversea settlement will have  tobe transacted by private  discussion with each  Dominion,  sincethe problem is a different one  from the standpoint of each ofthe Dominions and tbeir  Ministers will not  be  willing to  discusscertain classes of subjects in  the  presence of representativesof the  other parts of the  Empire.   It vjill.be very desirable,for instance,  to endeavour to elicit from  the  Canadian PrimeMinister the real attitude  and  intentions  of his Government, and                                                      this/
 this no doubt could only be done  in private  conversation. If in view of their political ana economic conditions  it becomes clear that Canada cannot  co-operate, we  shall  have to concentrate  in the  main on Australia.    4,    As regards Australia,  I have recently had  the  advantage of discussing the  position with Fir.  Percy  Hunter,  Director of Migration  and  Settlement in Australia.    Mr-.  Hunter has only  just  arrived  from Australia, and lias  talked to me in confidence  and with  great freedom about the  settlement schemes already  concluded.-  He  does not believe that  the  States arc capable of carrying  them to fruition.    He urges that we should proceed on  different  lines, dealing directly with the Commonwealth Government  and leaving the Commonwealth Government to make  the necessary  arrangements with the  States.   His criticism of the existing  schemes is that they relate too exclusively to settlement  instead of development, and he  con- sidera that much more  developmental work has to be done in preparation for successful  settlement.   As the development is effected, settlement will follow almost automatically,  and all that will be required in addition to seeing that placing  andafter-care of settlers is satisfactory,  will be assistance towards passages,  as is already provided for under the  agreementwith the Commonwealth.  He hints that Mr.  Bruce will expressideas on these lines.   5.   Mr. Hunter&quot;s proposition is at present somewhatvague in outline.    He thinks that the  Imperial Governmentand the  Commonwealth Government might agree that 1,000,000migrants should be settled in Australia during the  next ten years.   To absorb these people, large developmentalworks will have to be undertaken in the respective  States-                                                 Loans,/    .
 loans, totalling perhaps as much as  100,000,000, would hare to he floated- by the Commonwealth, and the Imperial Government would.be invited to contribute (not merely to advance) part of the interest for a period of years. The Commonwealth would make loans from the amount so raised to the States and would bear part of the interest charges itself,  so that the States might have  the fund at a very low rate  of interest.   Assuming  that the scheme worked oat according to plan,  the cost  to  the  British Government would include, say,  one-third of the interest on  100,000,000,  raised  at  the  rate  of,say,   20,000,000 a  year for five  years.   If we -agreed to contribute  to the  interest  charges  for a period of ten years in respect of each instalment,  our  total contribution on  account of Interest at 5-f$  would amount to  17,500,000  spread over fourteen years.   In  addition to  this, there would ba our contribution  to  the assisted passages for  1,000,000  migrants. This cannot be accurately assessed bat might amount  to 18,000,000,  of which  6,500,000 would be recoverable.The  12,000,000 would be paid out of the funds provided under  the Empire Settlement Act; the contribution  to interest would have to be provided under special legislation.     6.    It will be  observed that Jlr. Hunter&apos;s financial proposals are something on the lines of  our suggestions in  connection with financial co-operation for development within the Empire, but there are two important differences.Ha regards it as essential that our share in the interest on  loans should ba a  contribution and not an advance, and that the.loans should not be limited to  expenditure in this country, though he proposes  that an undertaking                                                   should/
 should be given  by  the  Commonwealth  Government  that any material required from outside Australia  should  be ordered in the United Kingdom.     7.   Apart  from  the Inevitable  difficulty  as  to finance, the proposals have distinct attractions,.  Prom our standpoint,  it would certainly be much more  convenient to work through  the Commonwealth Government only.    It is necessarily very difficult for us to ascertain whetheror not the schemes concluded with Western Australia,Hew South Wales and Victoria, are likely to be fruitful,but it seems clear at any rate that  they are going todevelop much more slowly than the Premiers expected,and. I am inclined to  think that we should secure greater efficiency and more certainty of success by coming coterms with the Commonwealth.  In any event, it looks asif we shall be invited at the Conference to choose between working with  the Commonwealth and working withthe States, and we must be prepared  with our answergIt i3 a matter of common knowledge that relations betweenthe Commonwealth and  the State Governments in administra-tive matters of  this  kind aro frictional, and it is not unlikely that 2 r0 Pruee may in private complain of our having made the  settlement agreements diraetly with  the State Governments,    In the Conference of 1921, I notice that the Australian representative proposed a Commonwealth scheme apparently eomawbat.on Mr. Hunter&apos;s lines, although on a much smaller scale.                                            8.  1/
    8.    I would urge very strongly that if Mr. Bruce makes proposals on these lines and holds out a prospect of being able  to bring  the State Governments in (which Mr. Hunter thinks is not  impossible in view of the difficulties which they are experiencing), we should bo prepared to meet him as far as we possibly can.   The figures mentioned by Mr. Hunter are probably extreme, but even so,  if the Australian Government are in a position to show that an expenditure of some such amount would really enable thera to take 1,000,000migrants in tan yoar3, I venture to think that the results achieved would be more than commensurate  with the expenditure which would fall upon this country, whon one considers what an important accretion would result to the  economic andmilitary strength of the Empire.    9.   It is only fair to add that if other Dominions found themselves in a position to co-operate on similar lines, we should have to contemplate contributions to their developmental loans as well as to those of Australia, but this is not a very probable  contingency.   10.   As I have said above,  a good deal  of the discussionwill have to be done in private with representatives of individual Dominions, but it is also necessa-ry to consider tha procedure and subject matter for the  Conference  itself. I presume the subject of Oversea Settlement would be  initiated in a general discussion in the  Conference  and that it will probably be necessary to appoint a Committee to examine the subject more in detail and to deal with questions of improve- ment in organisation, etc.
   11.    he discussion in the Conference-would naturally start from the  resolutions of 1921 approving the policy of co-operation for Oversea  Settlement.   We should give an account of the schemes concluded and the results achieved.    We should set  forth  the  difficulties: firstly,  the obstacles arising from  the  war  and from the economic  conditions  of the past few  years which have so seriously  retarded development,  and  secondly, points where defective  organisation has proved  an impediment to migration.    Under the  first  head, we should restate our willingness  to consider either proposals under the Empire  Settlement Act  or proposals with a.wider scope as foreshadowed  in the  telegram  on financial co-operation, and 1  should  like to go as far as possible towards giving an opening  for suggestions such  as those outlined by Mr. Hunter.   As regards the  second  head, we might briefly enumerate the topics as they appear  to us and suggest their examination in Committee.   She most important item is the  question of reception, placing,  and after- care, of migrants in the Dominions.   At present,  the responsibility under these heads is entrusted wholly to the Dominion or State Governments or in some cases to voluntary societies.   I am considering whether there should be supervision by our own representatives,  whowould also be of great assistance to us in reporting on proposed schemes, openings for settlement,  etc.   He shall have to consider how far we should go in this direction.At the moment, we have a delegation in Australia  studying this aspect of the problem.   they  will not be back in time for the Conference, but before  it commences,  we should have reports from them which  should afford some guidance.   A recent cable from Sir William Windham, of                                                     which..
 which  I  append  a copy,  shows  that  existing methods cannot he regarded  as  satisfactory.     12.  Other  questions  which  might  he  considered in Committee are  arrangements for  training of migrants on arrival and before they are sent up  country; the possibility of group settlement; improvements in recruiting methods here, especially so  far as cooperation of Dominion representatives is concerned;  settlement of families; and  settlement of single women and children, and of industrial workers.    I have appointed a small Sub-Committee of the Oversea Settlement Committee, consisting of Mr. Maenaghtsn, Sir William  Clark (Department of Overseas Trade), and Mr. Patterson (Ministry of labour),to prepare data on these subjects,  and especially towork out proposals for establishing our own officersoverseas.     13,    Lastly, I believe it is  not unlikely that thesuggestion may be pat forward at the Conference thata Cabinet Minister should visit the Dominions in connection with migration  and settlement.   If so,I trust that we shall accept the offer.    I am convinced that this will do more than anything else  to secure co- operation in Australia between the  Commonwealth and the States, and my experience teaches me that  this is urgently needed.   With oat it, no satisfactory migration schema is possible a                         (Signed)   ALBERT BXTCJCLEy.                                   31.  7. S3.
