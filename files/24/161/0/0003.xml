Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies                      covering Draft Bill.     I think It is desirable to bring before the Cabinet thepresent position of the British Empire &quot;Exhibition.     It will be rem6mbored that at tho end of last year theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury investigated the charges whichwore being made against the administration of the Exhibition, and proposed in order to provide.for more effective control-over themanagement, that a Board should be created as a Sub-Committee ofthe Executive&apos;Council and that, the Executive Council shoulddelegate its powers to the Board.  The Board was to.consist ofSir James Stevenson as Chairman,- Sir Travers Clarke as&apos; deputy chairman, a representative of the High Commissioners, and, theChairman of-the Finance Commit tee.and of the Management Committeerespectively.  It was proposed that Sir Travers Clarke should give the whole of his time to the work and should receiveremuneration..  The Executive Council accepted these recommendations.     In  order to pay a salary to Sir Travers Clarke, it Isnecessary  that&apos;legislation should be undertaken to amend theMemorandum of Association of the British Empire. ExhibitionIncorporated, since Article IV of the Memorandum provides thatno  salary  shall- he paid to any member of the Executive Council,I am advised that legislation is required for this purpose, asthe alteration which it  is desired to make is net In regard toany of the  objects of the Company but is an  alteration in theconditions  on which the Board of Trade licence was granted. (The Exhibition Company was registered hy licence of the Board ofTrade, without the/                                                        addition/
addition of the word &quot;limited&quot;^ under Section 20 of the Companies(Consolidation) Act, 1908).   The Bill would have to he a hybridbill, i.e., in view of the Government^ interest in the matter,we would introduce It and see it through second reading, but itwould then have to be dealt with under private bill procedure.     The proposal to legislate was approved by the Cabinet,  -but a new situation has arisen owing to Mr. Wintour having, ceased to be General Manager of the Exhibition&apos;.   The question has been raised whether it would not be possible to invite Sir Travers Clarketo resign :his membership of the Executive Council and to appointhim General Manager, so as to be able to pay him a salary withoutcontravening Article IV, of the Memorandum of Association.   It., ,has been put. to me, however, that to do so would Impair. Sir -TraversClarke&apos;a authority.   It is clearly very necessary that he shouldbe in a position to act without having to refer everything.to, theBoard,--especially during the summer months,&apos; when the members of, theBoard are. not likely to be available, and he is of opinion that.the position could not be adequately met by the Board delegating.powers to him.   It is also thought that the Dominions would lookwith alarm on the modification of the&quot;arrangements proposed in Sir William Joynson-Hicks1 Report which would be Involved,   I am.naturally reluctant to recommend legislation being undertaken ifthere...I.s any means of avoiding it, but I recognise the force ofthese arguments, and I think that we should proceed with, the Bill.     I propose that the Bill should be introduced in the Rouse ofLords as. soon as possible.   I hope to get it through the. House ofLords before the House rises, and it should be posBibleto get it through the House of Commons during the Autumn, session.        &quot;               &apos;&apos;   - &apos;  (Intd,)  D.  .Colonial Office.                     ..-     &quot; July 2rid, 1925,
