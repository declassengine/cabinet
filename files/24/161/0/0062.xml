SPOCUMSIT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HI3&apos; BRITAEPIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERHMmS23.                     CAB  I  I E  T.                            jliii)         British  Concessions  in China..      Memorandum hy  the Financial  Secretary to  the  Treasury.           (1)   I refer  tQ  the Memorandum CP.332(23)  circulated      by  the Pirst Commissioner of Works,  in regard to  the terms      on  which  lot holders  in  the  British  Concessions  in China      should be granted renewals of their  leases.         .  (2)   This matter is one for which the Pirst Commissioner      is  responsible, but the  Treasury  is  closely  interested      in  the decision, and 1 therefore venture  to add the following      observations,           (3)   The relevant  facts and arguments are set out  in      the First Commissioner^ Memorandum,  and  it  is unnecessary      for me to state them  in  detail.  The proposal on  the one      side  supported &quot;by the  Foreign Office is- -that  -a^rfjrgilt&apos;      or  practically a free  gift should be made, to the lot      holders,  of 999&apos;year leases  in place ef their existing      99  year leases (nearly 40 years unexpired).   The  Office      of  Works  and the Treasury, on the othe? hand, propose on      the recommendation  of  an Inter-Departmental Committeo      to  offer  renewal for 999 years eta  rental based,  not upon      the full  value of the  longer lease,  but upon  an assessed      value which  takes account of only one half of the      reversionary value  of  the buildings  on the lots at the date      of  expiry of the existfng 99 year leases^           (4)   I have examined this somewhat  complicated question      carefully, and I think impartially,  but Itcan find no      justification, equitable, legal, or  political, for the first      proposal.    Indeed the  virtual free gift to  a few interests      in  China  of 999 year leases  of property worth  6,000,000      seems to  me  to be absolutely indefensible.    The  terms
      proposed by the Office of Works are, if anything, -unnefcteJearily      generous to the lot holders.           (.5)   The weight of the opposition may be gauged by the.      circumstance that it is limited to the holders of &amp;ir%      of the lots;  The holders of 64% including the 2nlc of  principal Banks  in the Par East, and other importantlia    business corporations have definitely expressed theirina                                                     v3      agreement with the proposed terms;  the remaining 29%% haveonging-   not expressed their views, but there is reason to thinkok.      they will willingly accept the terms proposed as soon as      a firm offer is made,           (6)   The support given to. the opposition case by the      Foreign Office has in the past been based on a variety of      grounds which it is no longer attempted to maintain, and      the Foreign Office argument has latterly been confined to      considerations of policy.   It is alleged that if the      proposed terms are offered it will be represented in China      that we are making money unjustifiably out of concessions      received from the Chinese Government, and that theeffect&apos;      will be to weaken the position of H.K. Government as;      regards the continued enjoyment of extra territorial      privileges.   I cannot believi that this suggestion, whioh      would be a travestv of thefacts,  is likely to be seriously                                I      considered, or if it is, that extra territorialLty would      be in any way prejudiced thereby.    The difference in      value between freehold and leashold tenure exists and our      position vis a vis China cannot be affected by ignoring the      difference and thus making a present of it to the existing     leaseholders instead of securing it for the taxpayer to      whom it belongs,,  This is not how tha leaseholder themselves
at Tientsin at a high price,  because the present ownerproposes to raise the rents by SO per cent on the WarOfficer/hen their present lease expires.   The position asregards extra territorially-I understand, is that.IJ.  Government. in common with, other Powers have agreed(at the Washington Conference) to give up their privilegesas soon as the judicial system of Chinese is sufficientlyreformed to justify that course;   and in international commission ha3 been set up to enquire.into that judicialsystem.   If therefore my information is correct,H.F.  Government can maintain extra territorial privilegesin China as long, and only as long, as the Chinese Judicialsystem is regarded by an International Commission aaunsatisfactory.  In view of recent events in China it appearsunlikely that these privileges are in immediate jeopardy,and in the circumstances it can hardly be seriously contended that the terms offered for the renewal of leases in theBritish Concession can have any serious effect, one way orthe other, on the continuance of extraterritoriality.     (7)   I earnestly hope that the Cabinet will see fitto authorise the immediate promulgation of the terms ofrenewal put forward so long ago by the Office of Works;there is no doubt that these terms v/ill be generally accepted - as soon as H.I.. Government take a firm decision -even by the lot holders who are responsible for theOpposition.   If any lot holders prefer to stand out they/ill he in the position they anticipated when they boughttheir leases, and will have to take their&apos; chance of theterms that may be offered for renewal in 1960 (circa) whenthe existing 09 year leases expire.     (8)   Further if it is decided that the . lot,holdersshould be given practically freehold tenure without any
                                                  t)  0increase of rent, the specific authority of Parliamentought to be sought for the abandonment&quot;of such valuablepublic assets.   It may be contended that there is no: legalbar to the Government abandoning the right to the exactionof higher rents on renewal of leases but I am convincedthat to do so would be undue straining of constitutionalprocedure.   Such a transaction would certainly be broughtto light at the Public Accounts Committee and the Governmentwould be open to most damaging criticism for what would be virtually a surrender of large sums of public money te suchCorporations as the British American Tobacco Company andthe Standard Oil Company, who are among3t the lol-holders.If we are to abandon a substantial revenue in perpetuity,we should do so openly, give our reasons and secura theauthority of Parliaments                              W, J-H,30.7.23.
