Note by the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.     With reference to my Note (C.P&apos; $0(23))  circulatedby the Secretary to the Cabinet on the Prime Minister&apos;instructions on the 5th June last, I attach a  copy ofthe Report of Sir John Anderson&apos;s interdepartmental committee which has examined the. existing Supply andTransport Organisation and has formulated the  proposals set out in detail in the Report for the consideration  ofthe Cabinet.(Signed)   N.  P.  WARREN PISHER.Treasury Chambers,    7th July, 1923.
                      Roport for,, the Cabinet.       During the industrial unrest and grave strikes of 1919-21 a speoial Government organization was evolved to deal with the preparation and operation of schemes for maintaining the supply of essentials of life to the  oommunity, and to deal generally with trie situation, during strikes, look-odto and similar emergenolesi  It consisted of a speoial Committee of the Cabinet, known as the Supply and Transport Committee,  with numerous Sub-Committees direoting and coordinating particular branches of aotivity, and, dovetailed in with these, an organization formerly known as the &quot;Supply Department&quot;, with headquarters in Whitehall Gardens, oonsisting, under  a Chief Civil Commissioner in London,  of eleven members of the Government assisted by General Inspectors of the Ministry  of Health as Chiefs of Staff, a division of England and Wales being allocated to eaoh (Sootlahd having a somewhat similar organisation under the Scottish Office), and their funotions being to supervise and coordinate activities, particularly reoruiting of labour,,  in their areas and generally to  act  as principal Government representative on the spot.       This organization has not been reviewed since the new Government took Office.  Moreover ohanges affecting its construction  have  taken plaoe during the laBt two or three years,,  particularly the disappearanoe  of war- time personnel and the progreasiye reversion to pre-war Government  machinery and Departmental responsibility (including the retrenchment of  the  funotiona of the Cabinet Secretariat).  It therefore appeared to be  desirable, even though no grave emergenoy might be immediately anticipatedr  to  review the situation and to consider what should be the outlines of the organization, if any, now to be established,   The  Prime Minister accordingly  approved  a suggestion that an ad hoc oonferenoe of Departmental representatives should examine the problem fully in the light of present conditions (CP.260/23). The present report contains the recommendations agreed upon at  successivemeetings of this conference.   1.  We are clearly of opinion that,  if only as a preventive measure, the Government should have ready prepared plans   for dealing with emergencies of the kind, indicated in the Emergency Powers Act,  1920, i,e, emergencies&quot;oaloulatftd .......  to deprive .......  any substantial proportion of thecommunity of the  essentials  of  life&quot;.   Effective  plans  on a  sufficientlycomprehensive  scale  do not  now  exist, those  previously adopted havingbecome  to a considerable  extent  obsolete  owing to  the  disappearance ofwar-time arrangements  in the last two  or  three years.   An organisation on the  lines indicated below should therefore  be established now, to stimulate  and  assist Departments to prepare  such plans./          (This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1 a Gov9rriai*nt.)t 0 IT B T.            PUTUSK  Oj? THE SUPPLY AHD TRANSPORT ORGANIZATION.
   2,  The general direction of special Government arrangements for dealingwith emergencies of the kind indicated, and of the planning of suoh arrange-nients in advance,  should be specifically entrusted to an ad hop Committee cfthe Cabinet consisting of the Ministers mainly concerned with the HomeSecretary or some  other Cabinet Minister in the Chair, (see alsorecommendation 13),   3, Under this Committee some special coordinating maohinery will beneoessary, and this is disoussed later j  but we wiah to state at the outset that we think it undesirable to continue or re-oreaie more exceptionalbodies than absolutely necessary,   Practioally all the speoial war-timeorganization materiel and personnel on whioh the Government largely reliedin past strikes, partioularly the Hallway Strike of 1919* has disappeared.We desire therefore to re-affirm the underlying principle that each of theGovernment Departments must be responsible within the limits of itaavailable resources for seeing that suoh arrangements as are possible aremade for dealing with the emergency situation so far as it may be affeotedby matters within  the sphere of that Department,   For example, the Board ofTrade will be responsible for the arrangements to ensure that adequate supplies of food,  coal, gas and other commodities neoessary to the oommnnityare available for  distribution, and for collecting information regardingauch supplies.  They will also be responsible for their distribution by Bea(assisted in some  respects by the Admiralty),   The Ministry of transport should in future be responsible for the arrangements for the distribution *ffsupplies by road or railway or canal and for the supply of electricity.  TheHome Offioe will be responsible for&apos; arrangements oonoerning the preservation of law and order.    The Ministry of Labour should nut however be responsiblefor the reoruitihg and allocation of labour - that Department being concernedwith conciliation  and negotiations with the Btrikers it seems better that itshould, as previously, he as far as possible dissociated from aotivitieB whiohmight be regarded  as strike breaking.   As regards Scotland there would be a unified organization based upon the principle of bringing the emergency arrange-ments in Scotland  (except general government services such as the FightingServioes and the Post Offioe and to some extent coal and shipping services).under the oontrol  of one Minister or other representative of the government during an emergency.   The details of this organisation will be worked outby the Scottish Office and the Board of Trade in consultation with any otherDepartments oonoerned.   Coordination with ooal and shipping servioes willrequire special consideration in detail.      It should be for the responsible Minister to say what is the best andcheapest organization whioh will enable him to discharge his responsibilities,it being realised  that in many respects it will be impossible to guaranteeeffective arrangements in view of the disappearance of much war-time materieland personnel,      A fev? ad hoc  executive bodies may however be neces3ary, at any ratein times of emergenoy, where more than one Department or no Bpeoial Departmentia concerned, e,g, for Communications, &quot;Protection&quot; or publicity,
                                                                1 &amp; J   4,  The executive machine should be decentralized as much as possible andthere should therefore be local organizations oapable of being brought into existence at short notioe with persons on the spot who can take decisions and who are in touch with the Central Government and with the Local Authori*ties.   We think that for this purpose the previous scheme of haying a number(say 11) of &quot;Civil Commisflioners,,i who would probably be junior members of theGovernment, and to each of whom would bo allocated a Division of England andWales, should be continued.   We suggest that the Commissioners should be nominated forthwith and be invited to acquaint themselves with their duties.Muoh preliminary local work oan be done by their Staff Offioerg under ooverof their work as Inspectors under the Ministry of Health.   Sootland has aseparate local organization already in course of preparation, and this alsoshould be oontinued.   6,  The function of the Civil Commissioner should be to coordinate thelocal servioee and the local operation of the national services and to stimulate neoessary loeal activity; particularly reoruiting.   6. For this last purpose the Volunteer Service Committees (now about 88^set Up by the existing Civil  Commissioners1 Department should be continued.The Chairmen of these Committees are specially eeleoted gentlemah of localstanding and influenoe.   All exoept two are now in offioe, and have reoeivedinstructiohe as precise as the present state of the other Government sohemesadmits,  and in many cases they have been in touoh with their looal authorities&apos;clerks.    In times of emergenoy eaob has attaohed to him looal representativesof the national servioeB mainly oonoerned (railway, road transport, food,postal)  and a Finanoe Offioer (usually a National Insurance Act Inspector),   7.  The Civil Commissioner should have associated with him, besides his staff Offioer (a General Inspector of the Ministry of Health) and,  in times ofemergenoy, a Finanoe Offioer, looal representatives of such Government Depart-ments (e,g. Food, Coal, Transport, Post Offioe, Shipping) as may be neoessaryhaving regard to the nature of the emergency and looal conditions,  and amilitary liaison offioer.   He will also be in close touch with the Police.   8.  These local representatives will have exeoutive functions under thesohemes prepared by their Departments, and they should reoeive in advanoe fromtheir Departments as precise general instructions as possible, (these  beingcommunioaced also to the Civil Commissioners through the Civil Oommissienere&apos;Department), but we think the normal rule should be that onoe the emergenoyhas begun they should, as regards any particular problem arising, be regardedas aoting under the directions of the Civil Commissioner.   This rule  musthov-fever be subject to exceptions as regards some services (e.g. Postal and coal and shipping arrangements) vfhioh require to be oentrally controlled;nor will the Civil Commissioner normally be responsible for &quot;protection&quot;.As regards these, he should be kept fully informed, but should assumecontrol only in the event of the area becoming isolated owing to a
breakdown of communications between London and the locality concerned,  whenhe would, as long as the isolation persisted,  assume the role of the CentralGovernment,   9,  The question whether these local representatives should be appointednow or only when an emergenoy is immediately threatened is one for considerationby the Departments concerned when preparing their Sohemes, having regard inter alia to considerations of economy and secrecy (as to whioh see below),  10,  For ooordination of the looal organizations it is desirable to appoint a Chief Civil Commissioner in London. &apos; We suggest that he should be a Ministerpreferably of Cabinet rank (not in one of the three Servioe Departments) whoseDepartmental duties would be relatively light in times of emergency, and whowould also be sufficiently free to take an active interest in the schemes in normal times.  He should be a member of the Cabinet Committee referred  to   ;in recommendation 2.  His Chief Staff Offioer would be a General inspector of the Ministry of Health.  11,  The special maohinery for coordinating Government activities in  london under the main Cabinet Committee should we think be of the simplest possible &apos;oharaoter.  In normal times it should consist merely of a single standingSub-Committee meeting periodically in the Home Office to supervise thepreparation of the schemes and to coordinate them.  The aotual working  outof the schemes should be done by the Departments responsible.  Where a  schemeprimarily ooncerns more than one Department (e,g, the Air Mail Scheme,  whip Is is primarily one for the Home Offioe and Air Ministry) those Departments should maintain contact by the ordinary methods of correspondence and inter-departmental conversations, one of them being designated by the StandingCommittee as responsible for taking the initiative.      We think it would be advantageous that the Chief Civil commissioner should be designated Chairman of the Standing Committee, even if not alwaysable to attend;  his ohief of staff should also be a member.  The othermembers should be representatives of the Home Office; Soottish Office,Admiralty, War Offioe, Air Ministry, Treasury. Ministry of Health, Offioeof Works, Ministry of Transport (representatives for roadg, railways, and electricity), Board of Trade (representatives for food., mines, shipping,petrol, and statistical Information), Post Office, Board of Customs and excise, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Labour (for liaison).  12.  In times of emergency this coordinating body would be too unwieldy,and  should be replaced by maohinery better designed to secure rapid and effective executive aotion.  In previous strikes a large number of speoialSub-CommitteeB have been set up for this purpose;  we think that this shouldbe avoided in future, most of the work being done in the ordinary way by theDepartments responsible for the varioun subjects, and that the special  Sub-Committees should be limited to the following:     (a) B&apos;ood Fuel and Transport Sub-Ootmiittee consisting of representatives          of the Board of Trade, Ministry of Transport, Board of Customs          and Excise and Civil Commissioner?s organization, to supervise          and coordinate the execution of the schemes for the supply and          transport of food and fuel.
-S-131 (h) Proteotion Sut)*OoMmittee. to-supervlsc and ooor*Uaste-*eeew*8&apos;-ftjr       protecting persons at work, transport, vulnerable points Ac. and.       for oheoklng disorder.   It should consist of representatives of       the Home Office, Scottish Offioe, Admiralty, War Offioe, and Civil       Commissioner&apos;s organisation!  In so far as liaison is required with       other Departments or Sub-Ooramittees (e,g, when any of them applies       for protection) this can be secured by a representative of the       Department or Sub-Committee attending the meeting, (o) Oemmunioations Sub-Committee, to deal with oommunioations by post,       telegraph, telephone, wireless, air mail, and despatch riders,  and       oonsistittg of representatives of the Home Office, Air Ministry, War:       Offiee, Admiralty, Post Office, Scottish Office, Ministry of .&apos;       Transport, and Civil Commieaicner&apos;s organization, (d) Finance, Sub-Qomraittee, to deal en behalf of the Treasury with       applications for approval of emergency expenditure and consisting       cf representatives of the Treasury, cf the principal spending       Departments (Board of Trade, Ministry of Transport and Offioe of       Works), and of the Ministry of Labour (to advise on rates of       pay, &amp;o.). (e) Publicity Sub-Committee (probably).  This matter is highly specialized       and not obviously one for any Department in particular.   But in       view of the dlBbandment of moat of the publicity officers in       Government Departments, on whew the Government publicity       organisation has mainly depended in recent strikes,  the question       what arrangements are needed to enable an effective  publicity       organisation to be set up at short notise in an emergency requires       to be reviewed ab initiot and appears to be one for  early       consideration by the Standing Sub-Committee mentioned in       recommendation 11,      Some machinery will be required for maintaining liaison between these sub-committees and for the settlement or submission to the mainCabinet Committee of questions affeotlng more than one of them and  important questions of polioy.   We think that this purpose will be served by oon-stituting their Chairmen and the Chief Civil Commissioner a standing oa-ordinating Committee,   13,  Having regard to the foregoing we recommend that the main CabinetCommittee should consist of the Home Seoretary, Seoretary for Sootland,First Lord of the Admiralty, Seoretary of State for War, Seoretary of  Statefor Air, President of the Board of Trade, Minister of Health,  Minister ofTransport, Minister of Labour (to deal with the strike situation generally)Chief Civil Commissioner, and a Treasury Minister when neoessary.    Theresaould be two Secretaries, one being alBO a Seoretary of the Standing  Sub-Oemralttee (in normal times) or of the Coordinating Committee referred  toat the end of recommendation 12 (in times of emergenoy)  and the  other member of the Cabinet Secretariat,   14. On the subject of finance, while it may prove necessary for parliamentary reasons to deal with exceptional expenditure  incurred  by thevarious Departments during an aotual emergenoy in a single  Emergenoy ServloesVote, We think that the prlnoiple should be affirmed even more  strongly than
heretofore that eaoh of the Departments-must/be responsible for defendingits own expenditure in Parliament,   As regardo-expenditure&quot;in-normal times,we ooncur in the reoommendation made early last year (when the nuoleusorganization needed in normal times waB reviewed), and approved by theGovernment, that eaoh Department should bear on its own votes any expendi-ture incurred on its nucleus or-ganization.      The total expenses of all Departments on Jnuolexio-..BOiemeB,In mormal times were estimated early last year as  1,750 per annum.   We believe theyhave been considerably less;  but we have not explored this question asthe subjeot would not appear to be withinftlie soope of this report, whiohdeals with the outlines of the organization required.   The actual sohemesand their oost will be a matter for the Departments concerned when oon..:&apos;sidering what those sohemes should be (see recommendations 3 and 9).   15.  We have devoted some consideration to the question of keeping Beoretthe establishment of the organization proposed above.   Prior to the strikesof 1919 and 1920 not only the detail of Government plans but even the exis-tenoe of the special Government organization was kept largely secret.   Forexample the appointment of the Civil Commissioners was not announoed, andthe instructions to looal authorities were not issued, until the last moment.But the problem is how more oomplex.   There are no longer large numbers oflooal officials of the Central Government, through whom the sohemes oanbe worked, and although some looal Road and Pood Offioers, Chairmen of committees, &amp;a,, would be appointed who oould safely be taken into confi-dence, the sohemes would in future depend for sucoessful working largely on Committees of business men (e.g. in the haulage, food, shipping, and coal trades) preliminary meetings of which would probably involve riskof leakage of the Government plans.   It will be for the Departments oon-cerned, when submitting their schemes for approval, to deal also with thequestion how far the appointment of any particular bodies (or the issue of instructions to particular classes of persons) in advanoe should be oarriedin the interests of efficiency despite risk of leakage.   Our view on thequestion generally is that while there is something to be said for allowing the existenoe of a Government plan to become known,; disclosure of detailsshould be avoided so far as possible and that in so far as people have tobe taken into oonf idenoe they should be told only what is essential toenable them to perform their functions.   As regards the appointment of theCivil Commissioners, persons interested in Government plans for dealingwith emergencies would probably assume that they will have been appointed as on previous ocoasions and we see no harm in the faot becoming knowngradually!  any publio announcement, or their sudden and simultaneousappearance in their divisions in normal times, might of course create ascare and should be avoided.         If the foregoing proposals are approved the immediate action to be   taken by Ministers will be -         (a) to set up the ad hoo Cabinet Committee (recommendations  2 and 13)              and the Standing Sub-Ooranittee (recommendation 11)*........         (b) to select and appoint the Civil Commissioners and Chief  Civil              Commissioner (recommendations 4 and 10).
