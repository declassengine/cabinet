Memorandum by ,the Home Secretary.             ^Q         A Bill has been introduced by Lord Henry Cavendish Bentinck   supported by members of all parties to give local education   authorities power to regulate by byolaw the employment of young per-   sons between the age3 of 14 and 18.  At present, education   authorities can regulate the employment of children up to the age  of   14 and the employment of street traders up to the age of 16.  The   employment of young persons in mines and factories is regulated by   the nines and Factories Acts, but there is no power to regulate other   employment, such as employment of errand boys in connection with shops,   employment of van boys, etc., etc.         There is much to be said for regulating the employment of young   persons over 14, but it is questionable whether it would be possible   to take the question up in the present Session and it is also doubt-   ful whether it would be wise to propose further regulations, at a time   when many young persons find it very difficult to obtain employment   of any kind.  The present Bill would in any case require much amend-   raent and any proposal on the subject would certainly arouse some   oppositi on.         The Bill is at present being blocked by my direction.  If tho   Government block were taken off, there is a chance that the Bill   might obtain Second Reading without opposition at 11 o&apos;clock some night,         As there would seem to be no prospect of dealing properly with   this question in tile present Session, I am inclined to retain the block   and so avoid having to spend considerable time on the discussion ofC  this Bill in Committee, but as the general principles of the Bill   commend themselves to many Members in all parties, I should be glad   to have the opinion of the Home Affairs Committee on the matter.5th July,  1923.*&apos;f.

Education (Employment  of  Young               Persons) Bill.                MEMORANDUM.    The  Employment of Children Act,  1903,  whichhas now been included in Part VIII. of the education act, 1921, empowered local authorities to make byelawsregulating the employment of children  up to 14  yearsof age.  Except  for  those engaged  in street  tradingor employed in factories and other regulated industries,there is no legislative protection above that age.    In  order to  effect  the   further  supervision and regulation of employment, this Bill extends the presentbyelaw-making  power of local  education  authorities from 14 to 18 years of age.    The  power is,  of course, optional,  especially  asto what  employments and up to what  ages the lawis to be  extended;   and the use  of this  power  is strictly  safeguarded by&apos;  provisions of  Section 105  ofthe Act, as to confirmation of  byelaws by the Secretaryof State, public notices, local  enquiries, &amp;c.
