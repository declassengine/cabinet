COMMITTEE   OF   IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.NATIONAL  AND  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE  COMMITTEE.  MEMORANDUM  COVERING THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL  SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE                 RELATIONS  OF  THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE.    THE Main Committee observe that the Special Sub-Committee are not altogether satisfied with the term &quot; Seconded &quot; which they have used in describing the status of Naval officers  serving in the Fleet Air Arm.  It  is clear that the actual position of a Naval officer seconded to the Air Service afloat differs  from  a seconded officer as hitherto understood.  For example, he continues to be under the ultimate tactical and disciplinary  orders at sea of an officer of the Service to which he permanently belongs, whilst he  is  serving  under the immediate command of  an officer  of the Service to which he is temporarily attached.   Moreover,  the work he  is called  on to do in his temporary Service directly relates to the needs of his parent Service, and he carries it out  under the eyes of a commanding officer of his parent Service.. The  Main  Committee therefore consider the term &quot;Seconded&quot; not  altogether appropriate.  They would prefer the more general term &quot;Attached,&quot; provided the conditions of attachment necessary in this particular case  are clearly understood, as follows :  The  Fleet Air Arm is to form  part of the Air Service, and these Naval officers belonging to the Fleet Air Arm are therefore to be attached to the Air Service.   But whilst after their training under the  Air Service they  will be posted to units of the Navy by the Air Service and will serve under the immediate command of Air Service officers, yet afloat they will be under the ultimate  command  of the Naval officers of the Fleet.  Though their temporary pay and their acting, rank will be determined  by the Air Service, yet their permanent  rank and promotion will continue to be subject to the regulations of the Navy.   Lastly,  though they must serve with the Air Service and not be moved from it during the period of  their attachment without the consent of the Air Ministry, yet  as regards discipline and status afloat they  will in all respects be in precisely the same position as officers of  the royal marines.    &quot;With regard to uniform,  the officers and men generally of the Fleet Air Arm will wear a distinguishing badge on their uniform.  If the Admiralty desire, theNaval officers attached to the  Fleet Air Arm will retain their Naval Uniform withthe same badge.    If any  Naval other ranks and ratings  are employed in the Fleet Air Arm, thesame principle as regards uniform and badges would apply.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,       July 27, 1923.[10401]

Recommendations     ...       ...       ...       ....  4       PART  I.THE GENERAL  PROBLEM.    1.  YOUR Sub-Committee were  instructed to enquire into the relations of theNavy and the Air Force as regards the control of Fleet air work, and on this point theyhave taken a great deal of evidence from witnesses representing both Departments.    In addition to this, two of our members, Lord Peel and  Lord Weir, accompaniedby Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary), paid a visit to the aerodromes in the neighbourhoodof Portsmouth and the Aircraft Carriers &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;Eagle.&quot;    2.  In the course of the somewhat acute controversy between the two Departments,a very large number  of points have been raised whose importance is  subsidiary andillustrative.    This was  inevitable, and  probably desirable;  but the broad  principleslying at the root of the policies respectively advocated by the contending parties areperfectly intelligible, quite apart from the detailed arguments and counter argumentsby which they are supported.    3.  To the Air Ministry was given in 1917 control over the air forces of the country.The Department was at one  stroke placed on a par with  the Admiralty and the WarOffice, for, though  aerial warfare is a growth of yesterday, it was felt that its rapidly increasing importance required an organisation which would  ensure its developmentunder the most favourable conditions.  In these circumstances  it was only natural thatthe Air Ministry should strongly object to being partially dismembered so soon after  ithad been brought into existence, the more so as in the early days  of this dispute the severance of the Fleet Air Arm from the rest  of the Air Force meant  an immenselylarger proportionate loss than it would mean at the present moment.  But though the injury involved in the complete removal from their  jurisdiction  of the Fleet Air Arm  is relatively diminished, it remains in principle  the same, and if carried out to  its logicalconclusions  would,  in the opinion of the  Department, lead to many administrative difficulties and much overlapping, while in the region of supply and research it wouldhamper progress and  increase expense.                   i            .       [10370]                                        &apos;                   B
     4.  The Admiralty case is not  less worthy of most serious consideration.  In their view  a  Fleet  Air Arm  is  now as necessary to a  Fleet  as  cruisers, destroyers orsubmarines.   Aerial  reconnaissance  and aerial  &quot;spotting&quot;  are  as strictly  naval    atiqns as gunnery, torpedo  work  and wireless  telegraphy.   It sesms  to themintolerable that, while they are  responsible for the  safety  and success of our BattleFleets,&apos;the air work on which  that safety and that success in large measure dependshould  be performed by  persons belonging  to another Service,  imbued by  differenttraditions, and looking for support and promotion to a different Department.&apos;     5.  Your Sub-Committee have the greatest sympathy  with both these points ofview, and  they have giveiTmuch  anxious thought to the question of how they can  best be dealt  with.  They do  not  think that the present system  can remain altogetherunchanged;  neither do they think it possible/to sever completely  the Air organisation which does work for the Fleet from the Air organisation which is responsible lor HomeDefence against air attack and  for  co-operating  with the  Army in  other theatres of operation.  A course somewhere between these two extremes is  the one we recommendbut before describing our suggestions in detail it seems desirable to  give a brief sketchof the system  now in course of development along  the line where the  two Servicescome  i nttrcontact.  &quot;  -  -          .....                                     PART II.                               THE  PRESENT SYSTEM.         The  General  System     6. The general system is that the  Air Ministry raises, trains and maintains  theFleet Air Arm.  At sea the Fleet Air Arm comes under the operational and disciplinarycontrol of the  Admiralty, which designs,  builds and maintains the carriers.     The functions of the Fleet Air Arm  comprise  aerial reconnaissance, naval gunnery,spotting, bombing  and fighting.     The Fleet Air Arm operates at sea from a carrier, which is a  floating  aerodrome.In addition, in time of war, capital  ships and cruisers will embark aeroplanes, but atpresent the risk to personnel and materiel is too great to justify this in time of peace.     Ah  Force squadrons also  operate  over  sea from shore bases in co-operation withthe Navy,  but these are not at present in question.   .  The numbers  of the Royal Air Force personnel at present employed  with the fleet air Arm are 115 officers and 681 other ranks.         Policy     7. Naval Air  policy is, concerted by  the  Air Staff and  Admiralty  War Staff.Initiative may come from either side, but Naval officers  of high rank do not, under thepresent  system, have many  opportunities  of obtaining  experience or  training in airmatters to  fit  them for this work.         The Coastal  Area     8. Ap^vrt from matters of policy,  liaison is  secured between the Navy and the AirForce by  t\   special  machinery  termed,  the &quot; Coastal Area&quot;  Organisation.  This isprovided by the Air Ministry  for  the purpose of administering  the Fleet Air Arm on land, subject  to the general  control of the  Air  Ministry.  The Coastal Area is com-manded  by a  senior Air Force Officer (the  present occupant is an ex-naval officer; whois responsible  for the&apos; maintenance at full strength of the personnel and  materiel of theFleet Air Arm,  and for its special training for naval purposes.   He  is the adviser to theAdmiralty  on Air  matters other than policy, and communicates directly with the Com-mahder-in-Ohief, Atlantic Fleet, on all matters connected  with the Fleefs requirements.     9.  Under the Air Officer  Commanding  the  Coastal Area are two Group Captains,with&apos; headquarters at Leuchars (the  Forth) and Lee-on-Solent respectively.  In  thecase of larger operations involving the embarkation of  aircraft or  the carrying out of operations  from shore bases, the Naval  Commander-in-Chief notifies his requirementsdirect to the Air  Officer  Commanding  Coastal Area.  For minor operations he dealsdirectly  with  one  or other of the Group Captains.10.  Corresponding arrangements are made at Malta for the Mediterranean Fleet.
          Position on  Board Carriers     11. As soon as the Air Units are on board the carriers they come under the orders of the naval Commander-in-Chief, and are altogether outside the control of the Coastal Area Organisation, which is then, as we have already noted, only responsible for keeping units up to strength in air personnel and materiel.   The orders for flying  are given by the naval Commander-in-Chief (who  has an Air  Force  Officer on  his  Staff) to the captain of the Aircraft Carrier, who is, of course, a naval officer, and he gives his orders to the senior Air.Force Officer on board.   The Royal Air Force personnel are responsible for the cleanliness and maintenance of  their own quarters and some other parts of the ship, such as the aeroplane deck.   They can be employed on the general duties of the ship.  Difficulties have, however, been made in regard  to the performance of particular duties, such&apos; as the  training and use of Air Force personnel for passing ammunition to the guns.     12.  A certain amount of co-operation is practised between the  skilled  mechanics of both Services.  The Royal Air Force  may, for  example, utilise the  services of the ship&apos;s blacksmith for certain repairs to aeroplane engines, and the Royal Air Force may undertake repairs  to motor-boat engines.  Such co-operation is naturally limited by the highly specialised training which is inevitable in each Service.          Supply of Personnel     13.  The Air Ministry are responsible for the supply of officers and other ranks for duty with the Fleet Air Arm,  with the exception of  certain naval officers, who,  after training in Air Force establishments, are employed as observers in &quot; spotting &quot; machines and some naval ratings employed as -wireless telegraph  operators.-     14.  It is of importance  to note that the Royal  Air Force possesses a number&apos; of officers who were formerly in the Royal Naval Air  Service, many of whom were trained as naval  officers.   The senior positions  in the Fleet  Air Ann are at  present largely filled by these officers.  The original intention of the Air Ministry was that, in order to replace these, some 30  per  cent,  of the officers  of the Fleet Air Arm should consist of naval officers seconded for a term of years.   Unfortunately, however, only a  very few naval officers responded to the invitation to volunteer for this service.     15. It may be worth  noting that the general  system for the supply  of Air Force officers to meet future demands  is divided into two classes  :      (a.) Officers holding permanent Commissions,  and     (b.) Officers holding short-service Commissions.     16.  Officers holding permanent Commissions, on  leaving  Cranwell, are given the choice of the particular branch in which they wish to specialise.   Thuse selecting the Naval side will, in the first  instance, do four years with the Fleet Air Arm.  They may  then serve with other  branches,  including  courses  of instruction,  for a term of years  in  order to gain wider  experience, but will ultimately return to the Naval side again.   This practice will  ensure  that there  will always  be a  proportion of senior offic?rs in the Royal Air Force with Na,val experience obtained in the  Fleet Air Arm.     17.  A proportion  of the  officers holding short-service Commissions for  five years, after receiving their initial training of one year,  are  posted  for  duty  with the Fleet Air Arm, and do the whole of their service with that  branch.   On completion of  their five years&apos;  service they  are  posted to the  Reserve  for five years,  when  they are earmarked as reserves foi: the  Fleet Air Arm in case of  emergency.     18.  The Air Ministry endeavour to  retain the personnel with the Fleet Air Units for the normal term of service (i.e., four years), but exceptional  cases  arise when it is impossible to allow them to remain for the whole of that period.          Training     19.  The whole of the  primary training of flying  personnel, whether their future work is to be on sea or on land, is carried out by the Air.Ministry.  No criticisms of it have been brought  to  our  notice, and we do not propose to  refer to  it again. . the later and  more specialised  training  of  the  Fleet  Air  Arm  is  partly conducted in the       fl0370J                                                           B 2
carriers and partly  on land at technical  schools maintained  by. the Air Ministry at certain  naval ports.   Apart from their  initial training, before they are embarked, theAir Detachments of Carriers use  these  establishments for training, when not requiredby  the  Naval  Comniander-in-Chief for  exercises.   It  will be  seen  therefore that as things are at present these establishments are  used entirely for  the purposes of theFleet Air Arm or for shore-based aircraft co-operating  with the Navy.  The Air Forcetraining schools in the Portsmouth area work  in close touch with the naval gunneryand torpedo schools.   Behind the establishments  devoted exclusively to training&apos; for theFleet Air Arm are a series of technical centres  maintained  for the Air Force as a whole the resources of which are available for the Fleet Air Arm.     .         Design and Research Work     20. New design, experimental and  research  work  to meet naval requirements are carried out by the Air Ministry after consultation with the Admiralty.  The Admiralty,after consultation between  the two Departments, put  forward their suggestions as tothe types of machines which they require, and the Air Ministry design  such machines,as far as  is practicable  from the  point of  view of aerodynamics and similar technicalconsideration.   The Air Ministry draw up  the specification of  the type required,  and call for  designs from the trade, and the  Admiralty are  kept fully informed of theprogress made during the whole process and after the trials have been carried out.     21. The Navy are not directly represented on the design, experimental or researchbranches at the Air  Ministry,  but the  Air Ministry  utilise the services  of  a  certainnumber of ex-Naval officers, who have now transferred to the Air Force, in these depart-merits, and also receive reports  as to defects in  design and performance of machines from air Force officers serving with Fleet Air Units,  thus ensuring that due weight is attachedto the user&apos;s point of view in the modification and improvement of design.     22. There is also in existence an Inter-Departmental Committee called &quot; The Joint&quot; Technical Committee on Aviation Arrangements in His Majesty&apos;s Ships,&quot; which consists of representatives of the Admiralty and the Air Ministry.   Its  functions are to examinethe technical problems which may arise with regard to  the suitability  of  the types  of aircraft  intended for  embarkation on board carriers, and the modifications and improve-ments which can  be  effected on board  the carriers themselves.  It is  clear from theevidence that  new uses of aircraft  involving possibly new types can  be  proposed  either by the Admiralty or the Air Ministry, and that the latter  give full consideration  to allsuggestions which may be put forward by the Navy.         The Supply of Materiel     23. At present the Air Ministry are solely responsible  for the supply of all materielconnected with aircraft.   An establishment of the machines required for the  fleet air Arm has been agreed upon between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, and thelatter is responsible for maintaining that establishment  at  full  strength with its correctproportion of machines  in  reserve, the -necessary spare  parts and the various  shoveorganisations required for its maintenance.  This establishment is at present limited bythe number of Aircraft Carriers in commission in the Navy, but the Air Ministry havemade the necessary arrangements  in their  programme  of construction to  increase thenumber of machines  up to the number which  will be required   whsn the  two  new aircraft Carriers are completed in  I 923-24.                                    PART  III.                                 RECOMMENDATIONS.     24.  We have endeavoured to explain, in  the  first place; the  general nature of the objection  felt by the Air Department to any important change in the existing  system,and by the Admiralty to its maintenance.  We have also given a full account of thesystem as it has been developed  up to the present  moment.   We now propose to turn to the future and make certain suggestions which, as we hope, may go far to reconcile the contending parties and  to make material improvements in the existing system.     25.  Our task is materially lightened  by the faot that, in  the  course of discussionsbefore your Sub-Committee, a larger  measure  of agreement was found possible  on certain aspects of the problem  than had at one time seemed likely.
    26. In  the  first  place,.it appeared  that  on some important points the practice,though not the written.law, of the Air.Department was already in conformity with the.wishes of the Admiralty.  For example,  the Admiralty  are  very desirous  that  theGroup Captains  in  contact  with  the Navy should  be  officers with experience ofthe Fleet Air Arm.          ...                  .   .                    ,       .&apos;   -    Broadly speaking, the Air Ministry take the same view, and we  recommend that 1st Eeoom.it be  made part of the  settled practice  of the Air Ministry to  consult  with  the&apos; mendatl0n-Admiralty before such appointments  are made.  We think  the same principle shouldbe extended to the Air Officer Commanding  the  Coast Defence Area and the SeniorAir Officer on board a carrier.    27,  The Admiralty  desire that  the Air Ministry shall provide  all the  materielwhich they demand.  This,  we  believe, has always  been  the intention  of the AirMinistry.    We think it should  be formally laid down, and that, in the  event of the Air 2ndReeom.Ministry for one reason or another not carrying into effect the wishes of the Admiralty,. m&apos;&quot;&apos;Al&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;there shall be an  appeal by either party to the Committee of Imperial  Defence.     28. We  have no reason to believe that there is any fundamental  difference of opinion between the two Services with regard to certain questions of discipline, such, for example, as those which  might arise when a member  of the Air Force leaves the ship, where he is under  the command, for  every purpose,  of the Captain, and goes for training to the aerodrome, which is under the control of an officer of the Air Force.     But though  there are no differences of principle, there are certain obscurities which j^JjjJJj&quot;&quot;&quot; it would be desirable to clear up, and we therefore recommend that the two Departments should, in  collaboration, draw up a code of regulations  which would make clear  the relations between them at all points where they come, in contact.     29, In all  the  eases that we  have  so  far  enumerated there may  have  been misunderstanding, but  there has not  been  at any time, so  far as we  are  aware, any difference  of principle.     30, We  now turn to a class of cases where, as a result of discussion  before your Sub-Committee,  the Air Department have shown a disposition to meet Admiralty views. The first  of these relates to the  framing of  the  Naval  Estimates.   The Admiralty desire that&quot;: in these Estimates should be included the cost of  the Fleet Air Arm.     The  Air Department  are of  opinion that  technically this course would  be ^endS-a&quot; inconvenient, but have no objection  to  it  in principle.  Your Sub Committee are of opinion that  this question should be settled by the Treasury in consultation with the two Fighting Services.     31. The Admiralty require that the Air Force on board  ship should  be completely under  the  orders  of  its   Captain.   Your  Sub-Committee are of  oprinion   that, inasmuch  as all  the  airmen on board ship are under  the Naval  Discipline Act, this, in theory, is already  provided for,  but undoubtedly  in  the minds of  those chiefly concerned some  obscurity hangs over the subject.   This,  we  think,  should be  explicitly_ cleared up.     The  position of a member of the Air  Force when,  on board ship does not differ in 5th ^ec.om- law, and should  not diner in practice, from the position or, say, a Marine.     32. In order fully to carry out  the policy laid down in  the preceding paragraph, jjffffigy- we recommend,  and  have reason to  believe  that the  Air  Ministry  will accept the principle,  that all reports on  officers  of the Fleet Air Arm, whether confidential or otherwise, should be signed  by the Captain  of  the  ship  and  passed through the Naval Commander-in-chief to the Air Officer Commanding the  Coastal Area.     33. A further point which  should be  dealt  with  under this heading is one on ^J^tion.&quot; which  the Admiralty have expressed  considerable anxiety and on which we  have reason to believe that the Air Force are prepared  to meet their wishes.  The  Admiralty are apprehensive lest, in time of war or  other emergency, the Air Ministry might  withdraw from the Navy  units of the  Fleet  Air Arm, and use them for  other  purposes.  In respect of this we recommend  that it  should be definitely laid down that  the personnel, materiel  and reserves  of the Fleet  Air  Arm should  not  be withdrawn  by the Air Ministry  without either  the consent of the Admiralty or a decision of the Cabinet.
8th Kecom-&apos;mendation.;9th Eeeoin-mendafcion.               34.  Before concluding this class of questions we must take note of a complaint          made by the Admiralty that on board the Carrier there is a good  deal of duplication          of effort between the purely Naval Service and the Air Force.               We think this subject should be  looked  into by the two Departments concerned          and we do not doubt that arrangements can  be made by which all overlapping can be          effectively avoided.                                              Ti               35.&quot; We now come to the last class of questions with&apos;which we  have to deal, which          are at once the most difficult and the most important.  We are strongly of opinion, and          we have  every hope  that  the two  Services, share  our view, that, since  in  war the          Services may have to co-operate, it is vital that in time of  peace they should form an          accurate  estimate of each others needs and capacities.               We  therefore recommend:                (i.)  That Naval officers should be appointed to the Air Staff.               (ii.)  That Air Force officers should be appointed to the Naval War Staff.               (iii.)  That  some  means  should be devised by which the wealth  of technical                      knowledge  at  the disposal of the Admiralty  should be  utilised in the                       technical departments of the Air Ministry, preferably  by  reinforcement of                      the staff of these departments by naval  technicians.               36. These  recommendations refer exclusively to  the  headquarters  of  the two If          Services;  but  it is  perhaps even  more  important that  the junior ranks of the    ,          Services, who  will  in time occupy  responsible  positions,  should have a considerable 1          sprinkling of persons familiar with the needs and capacities  of the other Service.               37. The Air Force look to a system  of naval seconding for carrying out  half this          policy, and we cannot believe that the Admiralty would be  averse to having members          of the  Air Force on board the carriers.   Unfortunately, seconding from the navy to the          Air Force, as at present understood, must be  deemed to  have been hitherto a failure,          and we. find it difficult to  believe that, if the  present system remains unchanged and          unexplained, any great improvement is likely to,occur.  We cannot be surprised that          a young  officer who has just  joined  the Navy is  reluctant to  abandon, even tempo-          temporarily, the department under which he expected  to serve and to exchange it for one          which  is essentially different.   The feeling is natural, and cannot be ignored.               It must, however, be pointed out that if  the word &quot;seconding&quot; is thus used this          is not what any naval officer under the present scheme is expected to do.   In  ordinary          practice,  when we say that an officer is &quot; seconded &quot;  to another  Service we  no  doubt          intend to  express the idea that for the duties which he  had to  perform and for the          authorities he had  to obey  in the  Service  which  he has temporarily  left, will be          substituted new duties and new authorities. But this does not really represent the facts          in the case of  so-called &quot; seconding&quot; from the Navy  into the Air  Force.  The  duties of          the seconded officer, though carried out in the air,  remain,  nevertheless,  Naval duties,          and the Captain whom he has to obey continues to be a Naval Captain.loth Kecom-       ^n order to make this situation perfectly clear,  we recommend that no  secondedmendatioD.   Naval Officer shall be asked to perform  non-naval air duties, except with  the consent          of the  Admiralty.  We believe the Air Force  are prepared to accept this principle.               38. If this recommendation be  carried into . effect,  the most  important change          involved in the operation of whah is&apos; (somewhat inaccurately) called &quot; seconding&quot;  is the          change from  the Naval  to  a Flying  uniform a change which can  hardly be said to          touch the essence of the situation.nth recommendation       ^e  su8gest) however, in order to meet the  sentimental, though not on that account ^mendntion.&apos;  unimportant objection, that the uniform of a Naval flying man who, except for his          period of  training,  is to  all intents and purposes still under the Admiralty, should be          distinguished from the flying men under the Air Force by some differentiating badge or          mark.  This would be the outward and visible sign that  he still remains a member of          the  Service which he origiiially joined.  It  would  be a clear indication that what he          proposes to do is to  add accomplishments in Naval flying to the other  accomplishments          which his brother officers are cultivating.  If such a plan  were  found practicable, the          objection felt by the Admiralty to the introduction of what they deem an alien element          into the domestic life of the ship should be largely mitigated.
    39. It might well be that, if this scheme succeeded, the number of officers seconded from the Navy to the Air Force would exceed the 30 per cent, of the total contemplated by the Air Service.    We see no reason why  30 per cent, should be regarded as the maximum, and we should propose to leave it to the Admiralty to determine what the proportion should be subject to the proviso that not Jess than 30 per cent, of Air Force Officers, whether regular or short service, should serve on board the Carriers.    40. There is another, point of great practical importance on which something  must be said.  It is agreed that the work of spotting for naval gunnery is one  which &quot;should be undertaken in all cases by Naval officers, but such investigations  as  we have  been able to make convince us that naval spotting and fleet reconnaissance cannot be sharply divided, and that the officer  entrusted  with  the  one may inevitably find himself calledupon to perform the other also.  We have been unable to discover any objection  to this change, which, on the face of it, seems  obviously reasonable.    We therefore recommend that  fleet reconnaissance,  as  well  as  navalshould be entrusted to naval officers seconded or  otherwise.A -J A12th recommendation-mendation.spotting,13th Reeom-mendation.    41. If anybody will take  the trouble  to read the evidence given before us  theywill, we believe, be impressed by the number of problems for which a solution has  beenfound by the two  Departments or suggested  in this Report.  We earnestly trust  thatno merely  technical difficulties will be&apos; allowed  to  stand in the way of a settlement which in the public  interest is  most urgently required.M. P.
