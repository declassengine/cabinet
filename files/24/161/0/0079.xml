1LitV&amp;1623(rPTTIS^gpaJMBHT  13 TIPS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITMITIC MAJESTY&apos; S GO^/IRMMBIIT.)C.P....J.Z5..J231.CABIiiST.KBTOTCHMBHT- OF LEAGUE OF HAT 1 OSS EXP1HDITURI.Observations by the Lord Privy Seal on the Memorandum,CPi 373 (23), &quot;by the Financial Secretary to the                     Treasury.   1.   In his Memorandum, CP. 373(23), the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury makes a very serious proposal.   Heinvites the Cabinet to instruct the British Delegation tothe Fourth Assembly only to vote for the proposed budget  for1924 on condition that an undertaking is given by the othermembers of the Assembly that the budget for 1925 will bereduced to a sum 2% less than that voted for 1924.        It is evident that a retrenchment of 23% in thebudget of any public organisation can only be possible ifthere is an extravagance which amounts to gross abuse either in the administration of the money or in the policy uponwhich - it is expended,   I am as strongly as anyone in favourof most rigid economy, both at home and abroad, and I thinkit right that the League of Saxions budget should be subjected to a more than ordinarily rigorous control.   I do not believe,however, that a retrenchment of anything like 2% in theLeague budget would be possible without the virtual destructionof the efficiency and perhaps of the prestige and authorityof the League of Nations.   2,   There-are, as has just been indicated, only two ways  in which economy in the use of public money can be
effected:-       (a)  By a change of policy and the abandonment            of activities to which public money has            hitherto been devotedj       (b)  Economy in the administration ,by means of            which these activities are carried on.            Generally speaking, this primarily means            a reduction either by diminution of            numbers or by lowering of rates of pay in            the salary costs of the administrative            staff.        I understand from the Memorandum of the PinanoialSecretary to the Treasury that it is primarily in thelatter respect that he considers economy to be possiblein the League budget.   With regard to changes of policyhe makes suggestions which would result&apos; in only a negligible saving.   On the cost of administration,however, he suggests that the Labour Office budget forsalaries should be reduced by 1,400,000 francs, ahdthe Secretariat budget - it should be said that theonly possible way of saving without change of policy would be on the salaries of the staff * of 10$.        Before I examine in detail the FinancialSecretaries proposals under these two heads it maybe worth while to make some general observations on the way in which he has approached the problem.4.      The general assumption on which the -FinancialSecretary1s Memorandum is based is that the budget of the League can be compared to the national budget of one of its member States, and that if, therefore,owing to the present general financial stringencydrastic economies are being made in the budgets of member states similar economies should be made in theLeague budget.
        Without in any way challenging the general principlethat the strictest economy is at the present time essential  inthe League budget as in all other expenditure of public money,it may be suggested that the comparison indicated is not really a valid one.   The following general considerationsappear to be relevant to this point ;-     (a)  Most of the member states are at present retrenching          after a period of exceptional expenditure due to          the war.  Economies are therefore being made in          their budgets which show great reductions compared          to recent years.   The League is in no way in a          similar position.  On the contrary, it has only          recently been formed, it is still in the period of          growth, many -of the activities which it was especially          designed to carry out are only just being undertaken,          and it my troll be that a stage is being reached when          further expansion may be essential unless the          purposes for which the League was designed are to  be          abandoned.   The fact that there is a general financial          stringency is important, but in this connection it          is no less important to remember that a growing          institution like the League can only increase its          authority if it adequately fulfils the duties for          v/hich it was created.     (b-)  Every expansion of the activities of the League          means a further experiment in international co-          operation of Borne description,   Generally speaking          the experiments v/hich have been made hitherto have          been remarkably successful.   provided&apos;there is a          reasonable hope of success in any given activity          it is surely desirable that the League should          embark on it, for the building up of a system of          international co-operation is both eminently 1          desirable in itself and likely to lead to very          great material advantages and economies to the          states which participate in it.     (c)  Moreover, it is desirable.that this system of          international co-operation should be built up at          the earliest possible moment.   There can be          no doubt that through the various
activities  in  which it  is  engaged  the  League of Nations  has broughtinto close  contact  with each other1 a great number of -leadingpoliticians  and  government officials of different countries, andthat by this process of &quot;peaceful  penetration&quot; a new  conception of International relations is gradually being emplanted  in the minds of the governing  classes all over the world.   It  is duringthe next few critical years that such  a new conception may be ofdecisive importance, and I believe that this consideration initself is enough to outweigh ordinary  considerations  of  economy.   d)  It is moreover worth noting that it is only through theLeague of Rations that  the co-operation of the American  Governmentin international affairs is being  secured.   It is true  that this connection-operation has not yet been given on questions of great political importance.   There are, however,  American representatives who takea very active part  in the work of  the  League&apos;s committees on health, White Slave Traffic, and Opium Traffic, while in connectionwith the Greek Loan the American Government has  sent official representatives  to  assist the Financial Committee and the Sub-Committee of the Council.   In, addition, there has been a very effective collaboration between American relief agencies and theLeague&apos;s High Commissariat for Refugees, which has evoked thewarmest words of appreciation from the American High commissioner in Constantinople.  * There has been a  clear tendency on the partof the American Government in the last few months to increase itsparticipation in League activities.    e)   It must  also be remembered that on the Continent a proposal to make a large reduction  in the budget of  the League would be universally regarded  as an attack on  its authority  and prestige.   The recent  investigation into the finances of the International Labour  Office was so regarded in France.    It was for the reason that the International Labour Office is directed by a  Frenchman while the Secretariat of  the League is directed by an Englishman that  the French representative  recently made  a half-hearted attempt to  propose economies in the budget of the Secretariat. I suggest  that  at  the  present moment  when plans are  under consideration which would lay upon  the  League the very gravest responsibilities,  it would be most imnrudent to do anything that might be interpreted as an atterrrot to  diminish its authority.   5.  Having made these observations I will now endeavour toconsider whether, either by a change of policy or by a reductionof  administrative costs, the economies -which the FinancialSecretary proposes ought to be carried out.      With regard to a possible change of policy and theAbandonment of activities in which the League is at presentei!gaged, I think the general considerations which I have putforward are really decisive.    I believe any restriction of
the Leaguers activities  would have  a  most  unfortunate  political and moral effects        But  I  would also go  further.    I believe  it  can be  shown that practically every single activity which the League  has undertaken has  either paid  for itself  already by the  direct or indirect advantages1 which have resulted,  or is well on the way to  doing  so.    The  clearest  example of  the material benefits secured to  the  British  Government  by League action  is that of the Reconstruction of Austria.  That  operation  has been carried out by  the League of Nations for  a  total expenditure on the  League pudget Of  6,000,  of which  Great Britain pays one-tenth,  i.e.  600.    For this sum the  British Government has now in  it3  possession Austrian bonds  to the  value of t^o millions  pounds sterling which can be  sold  on the market to- morrow  for more than their  par value?  in  place of a perfectly worthless debt.    But for the  League action there is  no doubt that these two million  pounds  would  have  been lost as were the other twelve  and  a half million  pounds which the British Government had  paid out to  Austria before the league  came  on the scene.    By this  operation  alone the League  has  saved Great Britain its total contributions  at the present rate for the next twenty years.        Ever in  the less  conspicuous  activities of the League, which presumably  would  be the  first  to be suppressed  if economies were to be made,  I believe  the same  holds true0   For the  money made over to  the  High Commissariat for Refugees  for the evacuation of Constantinople,  the British forces there have been benefited  in a way of  which General  Harington has expressed the  warmest appreciation.        Even in  the departments of Communications and Transit to which the Financial Secretary  makes  special  allusion, the mission now being carried out by General fence, and  the  so-called  regional
conference are both calculated to produce a real effect in accelerating the application of the recommendationsof the Genoa Conference, and thus diminish the obstacles to international commerce in an important respect.   i submit that any results achieved in this direction are wellworth the trifling  sum of  520 which General Mance&apos;s -mission and the regional conference would, cost the BritishGovernment,     I suggest therefore that the tru&amp; conclusion which ought to be drawn from the considerations I have put forwardis that there are no economies to be justifiably made by achange of policy which would restrict the present activitiesof the League.6.   It is, however, still possible that even if there areno changes of policy economies can ^be made in the cost ofadministration.   The Financial Secretary indeed suggeststhat 1,400,000 francs could be saved in the salaries of theI.L.O. and he implies that 10$ could be saved on the salaries of the Secretariat.     I venture to suggest that neither in the InternationalLabour Office budget nor in the Secretariat Budget are sucheconomies possible.7.   With regard to the International Labour Office Ibelieve that the recent economies which have been made have reduced it to the lowest level that is. compatible with its efficiency.   I would further add for the considerationof the Cabinet that tho International Labour Office is very strongly supported by the Labour Party, both in this countryand elsewhere, that any further attempt to reduce its budgetwill certainly be taken to be the result of a &quot;capitalist&quot;attack on the only existing machinery which ha3 everapproached  the problem  of raising  the standard of living for
the working classes by means of International action,    &quot;&quot;*v8.   With regard to the Secretariat, I believe there isstill less possibility of making economies in the, salaries of the staff,   I have had exceptional opportunities ofobserving at close quarters the work of the Secretariat.I know the very great efforts which have been made by theSecretary-General to reduce expenditure in every possible way.   The control which now exists through the SupervisoryCommittee is very strict;   I believe it is true to say that every department of the Secretariat is at present overworked,and that the higher grades of officials sire, generally speaking,underpaid, or at least paid less than they could earn in theirown countries.   The technical services (typing, translating,production of documents, etc) are consistently overworked.9.   In conclusion  I venture to suggest that the continualproposals for the reduction of the -^ague Budget to which the secretariat is subjected, can only result in the long run indestroying the spirit of devotion to the League which atpresent animates its members and which is of incalculable value.     The whole cost of the Secretariat is at present only 529,000 - less than the cost of the Department of Lunacyand Mental Deficiency to the British Government,   Of this total the British Government pay only one-tenth.  It isa negligible oost.    If we are to pursue our policy of building up the strength and authority of the League and of extendingits activities in every way that is truly useful, I am con-confident that we shall have an instrument capable of producinggreat results in such matters a&apos;s the prevention of war and thereduction of armaments.   If it achieves even the smallestsuccess in these questions, it will in a few months repay many times over to the British Government all the contributions that have been or will be made,                              (Initialled)  R.C,  .8th August, 1925.
