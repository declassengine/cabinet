It is reported that the British Communist  Party has been instructed by Moscow to pay serious attention to work in Ireland andthe Colonies.    Moscow has also ordained that more  intensive  propaganda becarried out in British trade unions.    The manifesto of &quot;The All RuBSian Union  of Local TransportWorkers1;1 to &quot;The striking workers of Britain&quot; is quoted in thisreport.    Documents emanating from Russia addressed  to  the &quot;organisationof Post Employees of the South East District, London, end to the textile Workers&quot; afford proof of the interest taken  by Russia in trade union matters in this country.    Communists and unemployed are active  in  oonneotion with theoookers&apos;&apos; strike:  a speoial dockers&apos; strike edition  of &quot;The workers&apos;Weekly&quot; is being issued daily and the next  issue of  &quot;The New Charter
- 2 -364the organ  of  the  national  Unemployed  Workers&quot;  committeeMovements  will  he a &quot;special  dockers&apos;  fight  number.&quot;     particulars  are  given of the  scales of  relief  granted  todockers  on strike by  certain  Boards of Guardians.     It  is reported that some dockers  are anxious to  resumework but fear intimidation     On  July  25th two strikers were arrested on a warrantfor assault and intimidation  in  ths vicinity of Hay&apos;e Wharf onJuly 23rd  and sentenced to six months1  imprisonment.     The unrest among trade unionists  may, In part, be attributed to oommunist propaganda.
     It ia reported that at a session of the  EnlargedExecutive of the Comintern held in Moscow on  June  21st:          &quot;ZInoviev instructed the British Delegation     to give their most serious attention to  w&amp;rk  in     Ireland and the Colonies.  He also stated that it     was of particular importance not to allow British     imperialism to hinder the work of Soviet Russia     in its task of rendering brotherly aid to the     Eastern peoples.&quot;     The following report has been roce ived from areliable correspondent who is in a position to obtaininside  information regarding the Conmunist Party.Borodin, mentioned therein, is the Soviet agent, MichaelBorodin, who was arrested in Glasgow in August 1922, anddeparted in February of this year;          &quot;On arrival in Moscow Borodin took  charge of the     British delegation and acted as adviser  and     interpreter.          &quot;Zinoviev in opening the British Conference     said that owing to the conflicting reports received     in Moscow it was deoided to obtain the individual     opinions of the Executive Committee of the Communist     Party of great Britain who were in opposition,,     Borodin had reported to Moscow that there was really     no revolutionary spirit among the English people     generally, the proletariat was too bourgeois, and     advised a complete re-moulding of the Communist     Party of Great Britain.          &quot;All the members of the delegation  were  invited     to express their own opinion and after discussion,     MacManus (Anti-Dutt&quot;party) and Dutt and  Gallacher     (Pro^itt party) were appointed to a committee with     instructions to outline a policy on which the     whole delegation could agree.   When Gallachor     found that Dutt and MacHanus were beginning to sgree     he refused to attend the meetings ana roundly abused     MacManus (oalled him a self-seeking oad  and no sort     of a man, etc.)  In turn Borodin, Bukharin and     Sinoviev severely reprimanded Gallacher  and advised     him not to seok re-election to the Executive     Committee of the Communist P*rty of Great britain     Tho delegates eventually signed an agreement  to the     effect that they were prepared to abide  by the     Communist party policy and work in unison.          &quot;The delegates were instructed to make efforts     to bring out tho &quot;Workers1  Weekly&apos; as a  daily.&quot;Palme/
          &quot;Palme Dutt is to remain editor for the time     being,  Lincoln (who is really winteringham)  is to     be assistant editor and Jackson,  Editorial Adviser     with the prospect of being permanent editor  when the &apos;     &apos;Workers&quot; Weekly1 becomes a daily.   This arrangement     was suggested by Bukharin who had been prompted by     Borodin.&quot;  Radek opposed the suggestion, because he     wanted  Juokson with him in Berlin.          &quot;It is proposed to issue a quarterly publication -     similar to the Comiunist Review - for distribution in     the East and par East:  the publication, at  first, is     not to  be too communistic and will  be issued in     English - the international&apos; language of the East.     Radek,  Boy and Mswbolci are to be  joint editors     (Hewboia as statistical editor.)    The paper will  be     brought out in Berlin.   Borodin  will also edit the     English edition of the &quot;International&apos; from Berlin.     Radek&apos;s contention was that Jackson would be most     useful  on these publications in Berlin...          &quot;Hat Watkins,  rank Smith and  leckle were in     Moscow as Red International of Labour Union delegates     and Gallacher has been instructed to work with the     Red International of Labour Unions.  Work in the Trade     Unions  is to be carried on intensively.&quot;     It is reported from another source  that Zinoviev   iand Radek consider Harry Pollitt, Tom Munn and T.A. Jacksonto be the most able of the British communists:  MeWboldis thought to be of limited intelligence.     At a recent conference of the Workers&apos; InternationalRussian Famine Relief Committee held aa  a session of theCommittee of the Enlarged Executive of the Comintern in moscow it was decided:-     &quot;1.  To carry on with the work.      8.  To develop activity chiefly on educational           and propagandist lines,  by  means of general          propaganda for Russia in the  form of           illustrated newspapers,  photographs, meetings,          eto.   The greatest attention is to be paid          to the formation of Clubs of  &quot;Friends  of Hew          Russia&apos; - that i3,  unions of  scientists,           intellectuals, bourgeois, etc., who are           interested in the new &quot;cultural&apos; life  of          Russia.      3.   Ic support by all available means the  work           of providing for Russian orphan children.          Everything possible is to be  done for  the           technical and general education of these           children.
     4*    The raoBt  important  resolution is considered  to          he  that whioh provides  for  the future          development on two  lines of the work of the          Committee.   One - political,  educational and          propagandist - is  to be developed under the          direct control of the Ccmaittee;  tho  other  -          industrial  and comae.roial - under that of a          proposed  limited company for Industry  and          trade.  This co rap any will deal with all          industrial  und commercial questions and binds          -itself to enter into negotiations with the          Russian authorities,  in order to found a joint          mixed company, which will in future carry out all          commercial  affairs,  and export and import trade.          Those negotiations  are  in a good way,  and an          agreement will shortly  ba reached,&quot;     The  Workers&apos; International Russian Relief BritishJoint Labour  Aid committee  held a meeting in the House, ofCOuisohs  on July 12th  &quot;through the courtesy of ComradeSaklatvala and so as  to enable him to attend our meetings,but unfortunately ha  was called away&quot;.    The next exeoutivemasting  of this body  is to be  held to-day, July  25th,  in  acommitteo room of the House of Commons &quot;which has kindlybeen retained for us  by Comrade Boil  McLean,&quot;     The  Communist  Party of Great Britain is anxious to sell the plant of  the oommunist printing press at Bellshill for 650:   negotiations,  which seemed to be progressingsatisfactorily, have fallen through and a leading Londoncommunist in  charge of this branch of communist  work statesthat &quot;We  have had the disappointment  of our lives with thepress business not  only in Bellshill  but a transaction downhere has hit  us in  the eye too.&quot;     Attempts are being made  by the Executive committee ofthe Communist Party to establish  a circulation for the&quot;International press  Correspondence&quot;  in this country andTern Bell  has  written  to Listriot  Party Committees:          &quot;We shall be glad if your coraaittee can     undertake to order a ,;iu.ant.iby from Headquarters     each week*  We are having to pay 55 d, per copy and we     will supply these at cost price  plus poatage for     quantities,     Individual copies can be secured at the                                             Communist/

The importance of the journal will,     I think be apparent to every party member endeayouring     to keep abreast of international affairs.  We have     had some considerable difficulty in arranging these to     be sent here and. we beg you therefore to do your level     best to get a number of subscribers for your district.     However small the number let us have some so that we     can maintain a circulation for the journal     corresponding to the circulation which obtains in     other countries.&quot;     Trie entry of this Communist International publicationto this country is prohibited under a warrant issued bythe Secretary of State and the following extract from aletter sent by the Berlin Office to the Political secretaryof the Communist Party of Greet Britain is not withoutinterest in this connection:          &quot;As regards the 250 copies ordered by the party,     we are very much surprised that same do not arrive.     We are sending regularly every week five bundles of    . 50 copies each to Hendersons Bookshop since end of     June.  Please enquire at that address and get to know     whether any arrive at all.  If the British     authorities should interfere with our consignments,     we shall have to find another way of sending the     &quot;International Press Correspondence1.  We await your     immediate reply on this subject because it would.be     a needless waste of money if we were to continue     sending these 250 copies under these circumstances.&quot;     The sales of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; appear to be fairly satisfactory from the communist point of view.   TheChief Constable of West Elding informs me that theCastleford Group of the Cojamanist Party, which is actively engaged on propaganda work sells over 400 copies of thispublication each week.   900 copies were sold during Juneby the Perndale group of the Coirmunist Party and it isreported that there are about 320 regular subscribers tothis paper In Blaingarw.     During the past week communiet speakers have devotedtheir attention principally to the dockers&apos; strike, theCommunist Party policy with regard to the &quot;Book to theUnions&quot; campaign (see Report Mo. 214) and to the possibility
MANIFESTO OP RUSSIAN TRANSPORT WORKERS TO BRITISH DOCKERS         The seoretary of the Mid-European Bureau of the Red    International of labour Unions has sent the following    letter from the &quot;All Russian Union of Local Transport    Workers&quot; to the British Bureau of the Bed International of    Labour Unions with a request that if this &quot;letter to the    striking dock workers is till now not known in Britain, we    ask you to publish it&quot;:                      &quot;THE STRIKING WORKERS OF BRITAIN         &quot;Follow Workers,              &quot;The All-Russian Union of Local Transport workers         has received with warm interest the news of your         present struggle against the attempt of the capitalists         to starve the British dockers,  by continual wags         reductions.  We note, with deep sympathy and         understanding,  the spontaneous and extensive protest        -of the British dockers against this new attempt by the         employers to reduce them to a condition of slavery         and pauperism.              &quot;We believe that the British dockers will stand         firm in their courageous fight, and will allow no         cowardly or compromising leaders to deliver them into         the hands of the employers.              &quot;Thousands of Russian dock workers organised in         the All-Russian Transport Workers Union are watching         every moment of your fight with comradely sympathy.  We         send you our heartiest encouragement, and trust that,         with unbroken solidarity in your ranks, you will throw         back the capitalist offensive,  and emerge from the         struggle victorious, and with your union stronger than         ever.              &quot;LONG LITE THE BRITISH DOCK WORKERS1 UNION.              &quot;LONG LIVE THE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY OF THE         TRANSPORT WORKERS OF THE WORLD.

wi 6 mDOCISBS      The  London dockers,  elated with the  success  of  their maroh to&apos;Tilbury,  are making  strenuous endeavours to bring out the permanent  men working under the port  of London Authority:   the extremist section of dockers,  assisted  by the unemployed,  is reported  to have arranged  for  extensive picketing of all dooks  and wharves.      Many of the dockers  are  in a defiant mood and the determination seems to  be increasing to &quot;clear out&quot;  the whole of  the present officials of their union and form  an entirely  new organisation.    Lightermen,  stevedores  and dockers are attempting  to form a  union to be  known as  &quot;The Triple Alllanoe&quot;.      The  great faotor against the dockers1  resuming work is the decision of certain Boards of Guardians to  grant  out- reliof.   The following  report regarding this  matter  has been received:           &quot;The stevedores now demand an increase  of  5/6      per  week.  Originally they came out  against  a cut  of      1/..,    Now they demand  15/6 per day and seem determined      not  to give in. personally  it ia very muoh  doubted if      they will give in  for the reason that before the present      dispute seme  of the  men  ware exceedingly lucky  if  they      secured 3 dayB&apos; work per week.  The majeciby never had      more than 2 days weekly, with the exception  of  a few      permanent men at the rate of 11/- a  day,  The most that      these men earned per week would be  1.13.0.   They  could      not  at that tims go  to  the Guardians, in view of their      being employed. How, when  they are  on strike,  they all      apply to the  Guardians,  where thoy get 3,0/-  eaoh,  10/-      for  wife, 5/- for  eaoh child, 15/- for rent, g/S for      gas, etc,  with a  maximum of  3.4.0. weekly  at  poplar      and  a little  leas  at West Ham.  The following  is&quot;now      the  orux of the whol^i&apos;strikec A man gets more  when on      strike than when at  work.,,If, however,  these men  mere      Unemployed it would  be  different,&apos;when the Guardians      could sand them to work  or  atop their relief, should      they refuse work,  but being  on strike.the Guardians      cannot order  them  and consequently are forced to give      them relief.&quot;      On  July 22nd  Mrs.  Wilkinson  of the West  Ham  Board  of Guardians informed a meeting  held by the  unemployed  in
support of the dockers in Trafalgar Square that:          &quot;You people who work every flay in the week sneer     at the docker because he is fighting for a bob a day.     In dock land,  hundreds of men only work one  or two     days a week.  Some of you wonder where the docker is     getting his money from  Prom Boards of Guardians who     have members who understand the position.  They are not     getting it from the communists.  They tried  the stunt     in West Ham that we were not to pay relief to deckers,     but the dockers did get their relief.  If the clerk     did say no, we should have said To Hall with the lot     of you, we will take the responsibility of paying it     out, and the dockers get their relief.  The  ratepayers     are slating us for it, but we don&apos;t care a rap for     &apos;them.   We,paid out last weak in relief between      gge000 and Shi3OOP 1)1.West.....Ham.  We snoulfl  save all     this tc the rate payer,&quot; agreed, but what would be the     re cult to every Industry,  next week when the spectre of     hunger was tugging at the man&apos;a inside he would be     fighting for every job there was and would take it  at a     reduction because it would mean bread and butter.&quot;     It is reported that at a meeting of the west Hem Boardof Guardians held on July l$th an employer of labour inthe docks approached the chairman and suggested that work be offered to men in receipt of poor law relief and  la theevent of any man refusing to work proceedings should be taken against him:  this suggestion was turned down by thechairman.     From reports received during the weak it would appearthat many London dockers are anxious to resume work but fearIntimidation.     On July S2nd between 600-700 strikers from the SurreyCommercial Dooks assembled at Redriff hoad, Bermondsey,  andmarched in prooession to prsmierland in order to attend ameeting of the Transport and General Workers union which wasto be addressed by Brnest Bevin and Harry Gosling:  severalbanners belonging to the Amalgamated Stevedores labourProtection league and the Transport and Gensral Workers&apos;Union were carried and the band of the Doptford UnemployedOrganisation supplied music en route.     20 young German seamen, part of the crew of a foreignship lying in one of the London dockB, aooompaniea the                                          procession/
** 8 o procession on the forward and return  journey:   these-ae-amen sang      Internationale&quot; almost incessantly and called  at intervals for three cheers for the English strikers: processions of strikers from other London areas also arrived in time for the meeting:   1,500 were present  in the hall and saveral thousand strikers were unable to gain admission.     The arrival of Bevin and Gosling was greeted with loud and prolonged booing.   Mr. Coombs, of the Central London Strike Committee, rose in the body of the hall and appealed to the strikers to show they had lost confidence in Bevin, Gosling and the Executive of the Dockers&apos; Union, and their disgust at their attitude during the strike,  by leaving  the hall in a body.  This advice was carried out, the huge crowd loudly booing whilst leaving.     The strikers from Surrey Commercial Hooks immediately re-formed their procession and marched back to Red riff Road: here Mr. Ranger of the Unofficial strike Committee,  Mr. Blackmore, Communist Party, and one of the young Gorman Seamen addressed the marchers.   Mr. Ranger,  in the course of his remarks said they knew what had happened at Premierland. They had sacked Bevin and Gosling for good, and would have nothing more to do with them.  The Lockers had shown remarkable solidarity during the strike and were assured of a great  victory if they would stand firm a little longer.  The Bosses would  be glad to negotiate with them now they knew Bevin and  Gosling were no longer wanted.  The strikers from Surrey Commercial Pocks were as determined as ever not to return to  work until they were guaranteed the rates of payprevailing before the strike commenced,  and until guarantees -were  made  against victimisation.   some employers were willing to pay the old  rates,  but there, must be no return towork in London until an agreement to this effect was signed                                                      on/
on behalf of the whole of the employers and the Centrallondoa Unoffioial Strike Committee.  Reports were to handthat some of the Road Transport Workers in Tooley Streetneighbourhood were back at work, and other reportsindicated that blackleg labour was to be introduced in thatneighbourhood next week.    They would never tolerateblackleg&apos; labour in London, and therefore decided to have amarch to Tooley street in the morning.  The strikers would -assemble at Redriff Road at 6.45 a.m. and proceed to TooleyStreet and see what could be done.  He hoped a huge crowdwould roll -up, because it was vital that blackleg labour bekept away if trouble was to be avoided.  Before concludinghe wished to thank the dockers for the support they had given the Unofficial Strike Committee and he also wished to thank the Police for their courtesy during the strike.     Mr, Blackmore, communist, said he had heard rumoursthat men were dribbling back to work in Tooley streetdistrict because they had not got the guts to go to theGuardians and demand the food they needed for their wives and kids.  There was no shortage in London of anything, andhe could tell them there was enough food in Rotherhithe,Leptford, Bermondsey and Poplar to supply all their needs,so if anybody went short it was their own fault.  Ho wa3 gladthey were determined to stop blacklegging and the unemployedwould help them all they could.  Ho was a member of theNational Unemployed Movement and he would see no unemployedman would blackleg.   Ho was particularly pleased to see their Gorman comrades there and hoped they would march.-toTooley Street in the morning.  He only wished there was a russian crew here as well.  If ever they needed his help ha                                                    wouloy
                                                       a iiwould always be pleased to address them.     One of the German Seamen said that as members of theGreat German Republic, he and his comrades wished the EnglishDockers every sucoess in their fight against theiroppressors.  The workers in Germany had got their emancipationand he believed the workers of the world now realised that   .-their only hope for the future lay in the formation of onegraat international industrial union of workers. He wantedhia German comrades to give three cheers for the Englishstrikers.   At this three great&quot;Eochs&quot; were given, afterwhioh the  Germans were loudly cheered by the strikers.     On July 23rd a contingent of London strikers under the leadership of David Hunter, of the Leytonstone Unemployed, andnumbering about 1,000 picketed the gates of Tilbury Docksend were successful in getting nearly all the men to strike,about 100 men being all that remained working:  the Londoncontingent swarmed round the dock gate from 7 a.m. until about 1 p.m. when some left for London by train and some inlorries.  A number remained until later but by 4 p.m. all except aboulrlOO, who remained to picket on the following morning, had gone.     The London marchers to Tilbury were followed by a rationoart containing bread and cheese, which had bean providedby the Unofficial strike Committee and by Poplar and Plaistowtradesmen.     I am  informed that the London men had sufficient moneyto buy beer:  the supplies of one public house in Tilbtarywere entirely sold out and many men &quot;had enough to make them nasty&quot;:   no disorder, however,  occurred.     The shortage of labour at Tilbury Docks is affecting anumber of  ships.   On July 25th, however,  300 permanent                                           labourers/
                           - u - labourers of Messrs.  Scruttons, 150 permanent men of the port of London Authority and 317 ossual men commenced work.     Bodies of strikers have been active in the London area and have succeeded in persuading some permanent men mi lightermen to cease work.     On July 24th one of the permanent staff of the Port of London Authority was  assaulted at Silvertowa Gate, by the strikers who struck him on the head:  he then went to Drew Road Gate where he was again assaulted.     At a reoent meeting of the West London Area Group of the Communist Party of Great Britain^          &quot;The secretary read a note from Headquarters,     instructing the  chairman to devote the whole time of the     meeting to discussing the Lookers1 Unofficial Strike,     s brief report,  giving the gist of the arguments, and     any suggestions  to help the Lockers, to be sent to the     Industrial Committee at Headquarters.          &quot;All present were strongly in favour of the strike     policy, whioh was welcomed as a sign that the workers     would soon get rid of what was described as the     &quot;constitutional  leaders&apos;.          &quot;The general opinion was that active Communist     Party members in the Dockers and Transport Unions should     he instructed to work-unceasingly to break down loyalty     to the leaders,  and it was thought that great masses of     workers would then he ready to accept the policy of     1 direct action&apos;, led by oommunists.&quot;     On July 23rd a special Lockers1 Strike Edition of &quot;TheWorkers&apos;  Weekly1 was  issued:  it is proposed to issue thisspeoial edition eaoh  day during the strike.     The first issue  contains a manifesto on the strike by theExecutive Committee of the Communist Party, in whioh the dockers are congratulated on &quot;their magnificent and heroiofight against starvation agreements, and against theirreactionary officials who have tried to foroe them to accept such pernicious agreements.&quot;   The manifesto promises the dockers the assistance of the Communist Party, and calls upon all workers to help the dockers,  because &quot;if the dookere winit will be the signal for the revival of a new fightingspirit from one end of the country to the other.&quot;                                             The/
      The Executive  Coronittee  of the Communist party  offers  to the  Central Strike  Committee  the use  of  this daily ptpay for  &quot;-conveying any  news to the strikers&quot;as  they are  anxious &quot;that the  strike should get the greatest publicity&quot;.      In accordance  with Moscow&apos;s instructions regarding the United Front, emphasis is again laid upon the fact that the Communist Party is  not desirous of the dockers leaving their union:  they are informed  that:          &quot;You are  not out to smash tho Union.  You want     it strengthenedr.  You want it to fight the battles     of the workers.  For  that reason ask the leaders to     use the Union  machinery  on your  side in this fight.&quot;     Hie National Unemployed  Workers&apos; Committee Movement has informed members of that  organisation that the nest issue of &quot;The Hew Charter&quot; will  be  a special dockers fight number.&quot; Therefore we are doubling  the ordinary supply of papers sent to your committee.  We hope that you will get rid of them and send for more.&quot;    &quot;The National Movement must organise the strike.  You must set.up strike  committees in your district and appoint pickets.&quot;     The present fortnightly  circulation of &quot;The New Charter&quot; 11,000.     In the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and in dumber 1. of the Dockers&apos; Strike Edition of &quot;The Workers&apos;  Weekly&quot; Tom Mann states thathe is willing to lead the  strike if invited by the strikeConmittee:   the following report of a speech made by TomMann at  a  secret meeting of the  Red International of labourIMions on  July 21st is not without  interest in thisconnection.   Mann said  tbat:-          &quot;Tho Red International of labour Unions was not     out for any disruption in the  Unions,     He was aske&apos;d     to  go  and see what  he could  do to help, he ?^ent but     oould  see that the  Leaders  were at cross purposes                                               with/

It was last Saturday when he paid thisvisit-  He paid that when the ether Unions are prepared tohelp, although there is no indication that the men are ready for a general strike, then, will he &quot;jump into the fraj?&apos;and do his utmost,,  He stated that the capitalist Press andboss were only wishing that the R.I.L.U.had helped, whenthey would have been screaming about &apos;Red&apos; influence atwork, &quot;Red1 plots, etc., observing:  &apos;And what of the union officials?  They would have been as highly delighted asthe C&amp;pltaJist, for the reason that it would have taken a difficult posit ion off. their hands, and at the same timegiven them&apos; an excuse to also scream about &quot;Red1 influence.And what would have been the result?  The man would havebeen left on the hands of the R.I.L.U., who are not atpresent in a position to accept the responsibility.&quot;     On July 20th the Chief Constable of Hull sent me thefollowing very interesting report regarding the situationin his area:-     &quot;Ehe two principal leaders of the Pock Strike areMr,  Ti-Mc Worenop:, District Organiser for the Workers Union,Divisional. Offioe, 3a,&apos; Hew Briggate, Deeds, local Branch,19,  George Street, Hull.  He is also Chairman of theIndependent Labour Party,, and a left winger.  He was born in this city, and has held official positions in the Tra.deUnion Movement at Chatham, Portsmouth, Southampton, Londonand  Hull-,  He is said to have been connected with theWorkers1 Union since 1912, and is an ex-sail or, also aRuskiri College man0  He was at one time president of thePortsmouth Trades Council.     &quot;Walter Ridley who is now acting along with Worsnopis an old shipmate of his, and also a Ruskin College man.He is said to have been engaged in industrial disputesbefore.,  He; is the local official of the Marine Workers&quot;Union,  Vice Chairman of the central Hull Independent LabourParty,  and has been in Hull Trade Union movements about 2years.     &quot;Both the above named ara said to be of communistictendencies, but have denied it from the platforms, and on more then one occasion Worsnop has refused communists leave to address meetings from his platfoxmso  Both are believersin a new movement which they call &quot;Self Help&apos; that is, thedoing away with stevedores and foremen.  The men to carryout  the work of discharging the vessels.   .  &quot;At a mass meeting on the Corporation Field onWednesday the 4th instant, presided over by the localofficials of the Transport Workers&quot; Union, a number ofcommunists, including Marshall,&apos; Wilson, Dibb, jfairbrsss andBarry upset the forms upon whioh seme of the officials wereseated  on the rully which was being used as a platform.  Thiswas  done with a view to causing a disturbance but was notsuccessful.
      &quot;The Strike  Committee consists  of eighteen men, one half of which are  said to be  looal ccmmunists and not genuine dock  labourers.      &quot;public meetings  are. held daily in various parts of the  City by Worsnop and Ridley and a vote is taken by a  show of hands,  for  or against returning to work, Below are extracts from  reports relating to various meetings;-. Corporation field  r  8th .July, 19 23      &quot;Worsnop addressed  for about 35 minutes during whioh he said, &quot;She  agreement in  my  opinion is not right.  The reduction  of 1/- should  have taken place on the 1st June if the  cost of living figure dropped 10 points.  It had not, and therefore the old rate of wages should  continue until  January next.&apos;      &quot;Scottie Wright and two others, believed communists, were  together in  the crowd.  Wright  requested Worsnop to allow him to speak  from the platform.  This Worsnop refused.  Wright  made  two further appeals.  Worsnop than replied, TYou cannot, come up here, I am captain of this ship  and want no  communists on my platform Mr. Wright. I may bs called by the comnmnists but you are not coming  up here while I am here.:1  Ridley also spoke. About 2,500 people were present. Drypool Green - 13th July, 1923      &quot;Worsnop read several telegrams said to have been received from other ports stating that the men were holding out end still  solid, and he knew Hull was.  He than -referred to  several letters  in  the local press, end said, -1  that man wants a black eye, I can give him one, and if he is here, I will have six. rounds with him.  Is he here?  bombs  He is afraid to face  it, he is hiding behind  the papers.&apos;    I have information that Rdu Farrow of the  East Coast Gasworksrs Union (which includes the pit prop workers) is holding a masting of deal carriers, where,  I don&apos;t know, but if a resolution to return to work is passed they are going to start on Monday morning,  This is not  going to happen, we will see to that.  I have known people  go through it for less than blacklegging.  MenJ This  is serious and you must deal with them.,  Be there, and you icno?/ what to do with them.   If you break thair arms you will then be  sure they will not work.  Ridley again supported Worsnop.   About 3,000 present. Drypool Green - 17th July, 1923.      &quot;Worsnop said,  &apos;It has come to my notice that men are working at OhlsonTs, Zing George Dock.  Very well then, we must stop them.  Who,will volunteer for 7.30 in the morning?&quot;  He received a good  response - about 150hands/
hands went up - &apos;Ri$it you are,  you know tfiat to do (wedon&apos;t want: any bloodshed) but etop them working&apos;.  At 7.30amon the 18th instant,  out of the  150 men who volunteered topicket King George Dock about 8  turned up, and they refused to go to the  Do*k.&quot;Corporation Her - 15th July 1922     &quot;This meeting was held by the Communist Party at12-45 a.m., Scottie Wright presiding and after a few openingremarks he announced  Comrade Gibson from Sheffield.Gibson referred to the Dockers&apos;  Strike and said, *mcofanunists are out to help you,  the revolutionarytendencies at present in existence emongst the strikersmust continue and increase.     &apos;You are run by  the capitalist class with theirfederation of British Industries.  They spend theirholidays on the Scottish moors shooting grouse while youstand at the labour Exchange or  the Board of Guardiansgrousing.  It is about time somebody was strung up.  I want to advise you that you will get nothing while theTrade unionist movement is a follower of the CapitalistClass,  ana not the Working Class.   728,000,000 has been lost by the workers in the past  two years.     &apos;The Capitalist  Class oan call out their Army and police and that means extension of the strike.  I have beenin prison for you workers, and by what I can see of theworking class my sacrifices and  sufferings have not upto the present been of much avail.  Carry on with thestrike, and I say to  you that the whole oommunist movementwill back you up In support.  You must pursue anintelligent part end  call upon all Britain to come out on strike with you, and  th-: only way to do it is to follow and get together.   YJU must get the warehousemen out in Hull,i*nd the Transport Workers.  The  warehousemen in Sheffieldare ready to come out and help you any time.     *They can oall out their &apos;White GuardB&apos; as they didwhen the &quot;Triple Alliance&apos; threatened to oome out - theRoyal Defence Foroe as they called tbsm - Carry on thestrike, we will help  you all we  can to SKtend the strike.Stand now by the working class,  stick to your leaders, ifyou want to win, and  get plenty  into your stomachs.  Thereare suoh places as workhouses if you have no strike pay.     &apos;&apos;It is up to Mr. Howlett your so-called Unemployedleader to get his men together and organise them.  I amsdrry that the Communist Party in Hull is comparatively small, or something would have been done by now.  we,however, aBk the Trade Unions to get a move on, and if youoannot get them to by constitutional means, get them byunconstitutional means.&apos;   About 300 people were present.&quot;The/
     &quot;The Communists In this district havereceived instructions from headquarters to workunderhanded amongst the dockerB with a viewto causing the men to apply in large numbers for relief at the various relieving offices, andto work amon^t -the men in any way which they thinkwill cause dissension.     &quot;A secret meeting of the Communist Party washeld at the dwelling house, 72, pease Street,eleven members being present.  It was decidedto do all they could with a view to agitatingthe dockers, and thereby causing disturbancesbefore the dispute was settled, as it was believedby the members present that the dockers would bein by the end of the weak.     &quot;At every meeting that has been held byWorsnop and Hidley, well known members of theCommunist party have been seen amongst the crowd,none of whom (with the exception of Constant .  .and Steinberg) are dockers.&quot;     The Chief Constable of Bristol informs me thaton July. 18th Sturrock of the Bookers1  UnofficialStrike Committee sent the following letter to a dockerin Avonmouth:          &quot;Many thanks for your letter to-day.     You will ba glad to know that  the position here     in London is as strong as ever.   To-day we met     delegates from Hull, Manchester and  Birkenhead,     and all report a strong and  solid spirit     and pledge themselves to stand together.          &quot;Our latest news ere that Liverpool has     come out again, they also were misguided     by false telegrams end misrepresentation.          &quot;Can&apos;t you do anything  at the other     Channel Ports?

THE BED  INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONS     She close attention which Moscow pays toBritish trade unions is well exemplified in thefollowing documents forwarded recently to theBritish Bureau of  the Red International of labourUnions by the Mid-European Bureau in Berlin.     The first whioh is dated Moscow June 26th,1923, is headed:-     &quot; R. S.  F, s. E.Central Committee of theRussian Federation of Post,Telegraph and Telephone Workers           to theOrganisation of Post employees of the South East District,           London,, 1:1It reads as follows:-     &quot;We learn with much satisfaction that your organisation lias,  on the national congress in England in May this year, demanded the.admission of the Russian federation to theInternational of Post,  Telegraph and telephone Employees.  We hail your initiative in that direction, and beg you to tend oursincere thanks to all comrades that havesupported you in the cause.     &quot;At the same time, we must not fail to express our surprise at the attitude taken up by the secretary-general Bowen, whorendered a peculiar declaration on ourfederation1^ tasks.     &quot;Bowen is an old acquaintance of ourB.He is a member of the board of the Internationalof Post, Telegraph and Telephone Employees, andit is upon him and upon his colleagues of theboard that the admission of the Russianfederation is dependent.
     &quot;In the following short report, we are giving a reviewof his measures in this affair.  At the ena of May, 1928 Jthe chairmen&apos;s conference at Coblence dealt with the   . *postulate of admission forwarded by the Russian federation.Although no formal objection was raised, although we had declared ourselves ready to submit to the statutes and the discipline of the International, we received a refusal.Following a proposition of International&apos;s secretary-general Maier, the question was postponed to the nextinternational congress that met in Berlin on .;ugust 17th,1922.   There, Bowen and a number of other members of the,board opposed the Russian motion, declaring that it was  ;:impossible to serve two masters, i.e. Amsterdam and moscow,  and that he would be glad if the Russians had notraised that demand on the congress.   The same Bowen,,  \&quot;:however, declared later on:  &quot;The results of the voting dQnot  mean  that the Russian federation is absolutelyrefused its admission to the International.   The questionmay again be raised by the board, that may of itselfdecide the admission of the Russians.&apos;   The congressendorsed Bowen&apos;s declarations without obliging the board;,-by any concrete resolutions.                             .;&apos;     &quot;It is obvious that the admission of our federationis wholly dependent upon Bowen and his colleagues of theboard.   We are surprised at Bowen&apos;s &apos;dualism&apos; that permits,him to declare on one congress that we cannot be admittedbecause we are pursuing special aims, and permits theboard to take up an attitude of good-will towards the.Russians, while Bowen himself says he would joyfullyhail the admission of the Russian federation.     &quot;Who is preventing Bowen,  Maier and the others toagree to the Russian federations demand, seeing thatthey are all separately ready to do so?        &quot;     &quot;Absolutely nobody.  The truth is that they do not want to do so themselves, and are only hiding their truepoints of view to the national federation.   They aretaking up an attitude utterly incomprehensible for us.The masses must, however, force them;  that is why yourstep is of a special importance.   We are informed thatthat is not the first step undertaken with that aim inthe national union.                                       ;     &quot;We have once again addressed a motion of admission to the board, but are not sure  of its issue, although no formal objections are extant.   It will all be dependentupon whether the dualist policy of the board will infuture too be exercised towards us.   The charge of ourpursuing speoial aims is invented.   We declare that ourtasks only differ from those of the AmsterdamInternational in so far as the  latter permit themselvesto be led by the interests of bourgeoisy.   The AmsterdamInternational is aiming at saving ruined capitalism byco-operating with it,  we, however, are attempting torealise socialism by class-struggle.  If, however, theAmsterdam International and especially the Internationalof Poet,  Telegraph and Telephone Workers is ready to take
sop    up  the fight for the dally Interests of the working class,    i.e., for wage-increases, 8 hours&quot; day, for amalgamation    of  unions, for struggle against fascism and war, our    ways cannot diverge.  All these tasks are our tasks, and    we  are prepared to fight for their fulfilment with all    means at our disposal.         &quot;The aims of the Russian federation on an    international scale are the united front of post    telegraph find telephone employees throughout the world    for fighting for a better material and legal position of    the workers under the present order of society.  We are    convinced that cannot be in opposition to the aims of the    national federations1 rank and file.         &quot;For attaining these aims, we shall ever be making    efforts to communicate and to connect with all  groups    sympathising with us.  We, therefore, beg you to keep up    permanent communications with us, to report us  of the    situation of your group, on its numbers, etc.,  and to give    us  materials serving to promote a union of all  federations    of  post, telegraph and telephone employees.         &quot;we beg you to publish this letter if an opportunity    offers, so that the rank and file of your federation will    be  acquainted with it.                          &quot;With brotherly greetings,                 The president of the Central Committee of                 the Russian federation, signed:                             iutovinoff.

In it it is statedthat:-         &quot;The International Propaganda Committee of Textile    Workers, composed of representatives from France,  Germany,    Gzecho-Slovekia and Russia, which is now endeavouring to    establish relations with the textile workers of the whole    - worla, is desirous of arranging, between your    organisation and our committee, a regular exchange of    information on those questions which are of the greatest    importance in the trade-union life  of the textile  workers    of  Britain ana Russia.  The Central Committee of the    All-Russian Union of Textile workers publishes  a daily    paper and a fortnightly magazine.

On our part, we shall  be  glad tosupply/

We only know that there ere several trade unions, find     that thsy are organised, not aocording to industry, as in     Russia, where we have one union for the whole industry,     but according to craft or the various branches of the     industry* . We also know that our British fellow workers     are interested, in the question of the amalgamation of the     various textile unions, and. that fundamental questions     of the every-day life of the workers, such as hours and     wages, engross the attention of the British textile workers     as they do that of workers the world over,,  We would     like to be fully informed on all these questions, and also&apos;     on several othwr points.  We should especially like to     know the total membership of the various textile unions,     and details of the problems of unemployment, emigration,     etc.,          &quot;We are anxious to receive information regarding all     the above-mentioned questions.  We are forwarding you the     resolution of the last full meeting of the Central     Committee of cur union.  We are also sending you copies     of our newspaper and our magazine,   trusting that you     will send us copies of your official publications in     exchange.  On. receipt of your information, we shall also     send you a complete report on the A11-Bussian Union of     Textile Workers.

The growth of  a  fresn fighting spirit  among the  masses is     best revealed  by the formation of a left  wing within the     Amsterdam International.          &quot;In this  situation the  era session of the Central     Council of the Red International  of labour Unions is  ofspecial/
-El -special significance.     &quot;The task set the session consists in solving anumber of practical questions arising out of the growth of the revolutionary movement in every country.  Thestruggle against war danger and Fascism is among the first and most urgent task imposed! on the R.I.L.U.   Growingreaction cannot be conquered by agitation and propagandaalone;  this work requires a comprehensive organizatoryactivity for the gathering together and concentration of the masses, for the formation of organization centresat the most important strategic fighting points.  Thecommittees of action,  control committees, dock bureaux,etc. called into existence by the Frankfort conferenceand the International Conference of the Transport v/orkersmust be further developed.     &quot;The further struggle for the united front logicallyfollows from the whole situation of the working class.Organizatory forms must be created, the organs for theunited front.  As the struggle for the united front forms the preparation for the new unified trade union movement,the struggle against the split in the trade unions andagairpt, the&quot; expul eronTlffastTje&apos; &apos;carrleT&apos;^on with even greater;energy &quot;and aotrvTEy jlian heretofore.  in line interests of&quot;work among the masses, the&apos; functions of the internationalpropaganda committees representing the various branchesof production, and their relations to the secretariatsaffiliated to the Amsterdam International, must be more clearly defined.     &quot;A large number of organizatory questions awaitsolution.  The revolutionary trade union movement is, inmost countries, still being run on the old reformistprinciples.  The re-organisation of the trade unions isthe present praotical task of the international tradeunion movement.  Besides this, highly important problemsof our strike strategy have to be dealt with.  Thequestion of national conflicts within the trade union movement must be solvedc  We must decide on our future relations to the Amsterdam International, and to thatLiliputian edition, the anarcho-syndicalist international.The Central Council will discuss the question of combatingthe penetration of Fuscisti into the trade unions.  Therevolutionary trade unions must further devote their attention to the question of emigration among the workers,to the working conditions obtaining in the countriescoming in question for the emigrants andto all thepractical complications entailed.  In addition to all this,there is also on the agenda, the discussion of the work being done by the followers of the K.I.L.U. in Englandand in Czecho-Slovakia.     &quot;The commissions will have to deal with the questionsof the harbour bureaux, of the working conditions amongseamen, of work among women and youth, of the trade unionpress and literature, of the system of information andconnections, of the activity of the followers of theR.I.L.U. in America,  of the work in Spain, of the work intho Near and Far East, etc   The activity of the variouscentres of the R.I.L.U. (Central European Bureau, LatinBureau/
        Bureau,  etc.),  will be submitted to speoial examination.             &quot;All this  practical work will be further        supplemented,by a special report on the organizatory form        of trade union opposition...             &quot;The growth of the revolutionary trade union        movement is partly the result of objective facts, partly        the result of the conscious activity of the Comintern,        the R.I.L.U.,  and the organizations affiliated to them.        The power of the I.I.L.U. lies in the fact that it        always works hand in hand with the Comintern.&quot;        A combined propaganda and social meeting was held by the   Red International of labour Unions in London on July 80th. I Tom Mann, who was in the chair stated that the object of such 1 I meetings was  to encourage new speakers, to give comrades an I   opportunity of comparing notes, to help forward the team work   for the general strike which could only be attained by comrades   working hard  in their respective unions and Trades Councils   for affiliation of the unions and Councils to the Bed   International of labour Unions.        Adams described the work of the Woolwich Trades Council,   of which he is a member:  He stated that he was working hard   for the Bed International of Labour unions and was attempting   to re-establish Shop stewards Committees in workshops and   factories.pYUUBG C0MMUITI5T LEAGUE        Tho following manifesto issued by the Executive Committee   of the  Young  Communist International has been printed by the   communist,  C.

iT^RJMQaUTIOtJARY ACTIVITIES IH GREAT BRITAIN        Irish extremists in England are very quiet just at   the moment, their principal trouble apparently being lack   of funds.-   The Irish sal  -Determination League is   considering the question of closing down owing to   financial  difficulties.        Another attempt is being made to get hold of monies                     ,t   belonging  to the Gaelic  League.  At a meeting of the   Executive  of that League, held on July 21st, a strong appeal   made by three members, who are also members of the Irish   Self-Determination League, for a grant towards the Irish.   Prisoners  Defence funds,  was rejected on the grounds that   the constitution of the  League clearly defines its objects   as educational and decides that it shall not ally itself   with any political party.  It was also suggested that the   London County Council would probably refuse them use of   their schools if they made party grants.  An attempt will.   however be made to upset this ruling by calling a general   meeting and packing it with Art CBrie^s.supporters.        As far as the open  movement is concerned there will be   little or  no activity until the Deportees&apos; claims are   settled.    They were all active leaders and are not likely   to allow anything to happen which may prejudice their chances   of substantial compensation.        An attempt is being made to keep the secret or Irish                                              Reptiblioan/   &quot;  A finanolal  statement  was recently sent  by thesecretary  of  the  Young  Communist league in London to  the berlin Bureau:  from it it  appears  that the Young CommunistLeague owes the Berlin  Bureau  43*18. 7-^.
