Terms of Reference and Composition.    THE Committee on National and Imperial Defence at their First Meeting, heldon the 16th March,  1923, had under consideration the question of various schemes which had been put  forward for the development of a Commercial Airship Service.    It was agreed-        That a Committee composed of representatives  of the Admiralty, Air    Ministry and Treasury should be appointed  to examine further the financial    aspects of these schemes, and that this Committee should submit their Report    for consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence.    2. The Sub-Committee was constituted as follows :      The Right Hon. Sir Samuel Hqare,Bart., C.M.G.,M.P., Secretary of State for         Air, assisted by His Grace the Duke of Sutherland, Under-Secretary of          State for Air, and Sir W. F.  Nicholson, K.C.B&apos;., Secretary to the Air         Ministry.     The Right Hon. L. S. Amery, M.P., First Lord of the Admiralty, assisted by         Rear-Admiral C. T, M. Fuller, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., Third Sea Lord,         and Sir Vincent  W. Baddeley, K.C.B., Admiralty.     *Major A- Boyd-Carpenter, M.P., Financial Secretary to the Treasury, assisted         by Sir George L.  Barstow,  K.G.B., Controller  of  Supply  Services,         Treasury.    3. Since August 1919, several attempts have been made to set up a CommercialAirship.  Service, but in each case the negotiations have broken down owing to thefinancial terms demanded from His. Majesty&apos;.s Government.  A summary of  theprincipal incidents  that have taken place in  connection  with Airship1  policy from august 1919 to April 1922, is given in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State forAir (C.I.D. 404-B).    4. In April 1922, Lieutenant-Commander C.  D. Burney put forward his firstproposals for a commercial  scheme.  This scheme&apos;was considered by the  Standing   * On the 29th May,  1923,  the Eight Hon. -Sir W. Joynson-Hicks, Bart., M&apos;.P., took the place of major Boyd-Oarpenter on  the Sub-Committee..     [10291]  [10332]
Defence  Sub-Committee at their 23rd Meeting on the 12th  July, 1922, when thefollowing conclusions were arrived at     (1.)  That no  money should  at present be expended in developing; an airship           service either for commercial purposes or with the object of establishing           Imperial communications.    (2.)  That a special Sub-Committee, with Mr. Amery  as Chairman, and  with           representatives of the Admiralty, War Office,  Air Ministry, Colonial           Office and Treasury as members, should be appointed to study in detail           the technical aspects of Commander Burney&apos;s  scheme, ,with  a view to           ascertaining if Commander Burney&apos;s claims were well founded, and if           his. scheme was likely to produce airships which  would be of national           value in time of war.    (3.)   That the Air Ministry should prepare estimates of the cost of keeping the           airship&apos; establishment at Pulham in being.    The special Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Amery, set up inaccordance with Conclusion (2) above, reported on the 1st August, 1922, in favour ofthe desirability of pressing forward with the development of an airship service.    5. The Admiralty attach great importance to airships on the ground of theirpotential  utility as a means of  Naval reconnaissance.    The  First  Lord of  theAdmiralty in his memorandum (C.I.D. Paper 899-B) states that          &quot; In Naval operations extending into the Atlantic or Pacific, necessitating    the sweeping  out of ocean spaces in search  of enemy war vessels,  operations in    which the time factor exercises an  all-important influence,  airships may well    prove to be the Naval units most economical in their action&apos;, and  most efficient    in their performance.&quot;    The Air Staff have also expressed their concurrence that airships  may prove ofgreat value for this purpose (C.I.D. 344-B).    6. The Secretary of State for Air,  in his Memorandum  404-B, lays  emphasis on  two other aspects of  the importance  of airships  to the British Empire, asfollows :          &quot; (a.)  In the first place, I consider that airships offer at the present  time    the best method of  developing an Imperial air route.  The unsettled conditions    now prevailing in Europe and the Middle East must, for some time, be a serious    drawback to the successful development of Imperial Air Routes for aeroplanes.    The immediate prospect is more hopeful for airships with their vastly greater    endurance  and constant ability  to travel in  long stages without  frequent    intervening stopping places.         &quot; (b.)  Secondly; it is clear that if it proves feasible in practice to construct    air-worthy vessels of  the capacity and  performance projected by Commander    Burney, and to operate them successfully in all climates, airships will possess    great potentialities for Service transport  purposes and as  aircraft carriers,    particularly from the point of view of the  Royal Air  Force acting against an    uncivilised or semi-civilised enemy.&quot;    7. In the  last few weeks further stress  has been laid on the importance of acommercial airship service to the British Empire by the  Report of  the imperial shipping Committee set up in accordance  with a resolution of  the Imperial  WatConference on the 26th July, 1918, and by the views expressed in connection with theReport by the President of the Board of Trade.  As the best and most economicalmethod of  curtailing the  time of  transit  of the  mails to  Australia,  the imperial shipping Committee advocate the setting up of an air mail by means  of airshipsfrom Great Britain to Egypt, and thence by mail  steamer.  The  arguments used bythe Imperial Shipping Committee for the institution of an airship service appear tous to be of great weight, and we consider thatthe advantages envisaged by them mustbe  taken into  consideration by  His Majesty&apos;s Government  when  considering thefinancial cost of subsidising a Commercial Airship&apos; Service.     8. The advantage  of  having a concrete scheme in being before  the  Assemblyof  the Imperial Conference next October appears to us to be of great importance.An airship service to Egypt, with the resultant acceleration of the time of transitof  mails to Australia, will ho doubt prove an attraction to the Government of tmJ
 Commonwealth of Australia, and might well result in substantial financial assistance being forthcoming from them, at any rate for that part of the scheme which provides for an extension of the airship  service from India to Australia.    9. If the development of the airship is to be proceeded with, and the arguments in favour of it are, in our opinion, conclusive, this could be done either by direct expenditure by the Air Ministry, or by  the  subsidising  of a commercial service such as is proposed by Lieutenant-Commander Burney.    As a rough estimate, direct research by the Air Ministry with one airship would cost  approximately  250,000 a year.    The subsidising of a commercial  company will  initially cost more, but if the scheme proves  to-be successful, these  subsidies will  be repayable.  Further,  a commercial  service is likely  to  provide greaterexperience  of  the working- capacity of  airships in all climates and conditions of wind and weather.   We consider that the latter alternative is to be preferred.    10. In  the course of our  enquiry,  two  proposals for  the institution of  acommercial  airship service  have  been  laid  before  us, the  first  bv  Lieutenant- Commander C. D. Burney, and the second by  Commander F. L. M. &quot;Boothby.   Wehave had the benefit of hearing these proposals explained  to us by their respectiveproposers.    11. The original proposals submitted by Lieutenant-Commander Burney havebeen subject to considerable alteration as a result of Conferences and correspondence with the  Committee.   His latest  proposals appear  to us to be the most suitableof those that have been laid before us.   These proposals are not final in all theirdetails, and modifications may be expected as a result of further negotiations withthe Government Departments.   We have,  however, formed the conclusion that thetotal of  500,000, which would be provided by Lieutenant-Commander Burney, ifthe whole of his scheme is completed, is  the maximum amount of private capitalthat is likely to be forthcoming  for our airship scheme.    Commander Boothby&apos;s proposals are too indefinite for  serious consideration.    12. The Burney proposals are based on-     (a.) The  payment  by His  Majesty&apos;s Government of  a yearly  subsidy for  a          period of seven years.   The payment of this subsidy to be divided into          three stages, each  stage being  dependent on the results of the previous          stage.   The  subsidy would be repayable  on the.lines  of the scheme          proposed by Sir H. Hambling&apos;s Committee upon Aeroplane Transport.    (b.) Fee payments  to be paid to the Company for services  rendered.    The rough outlines of the proposals are as follows:     First Stage:  The formation of a construction and guarantee company with  a        capital of  600,000.         300,000 of this capital to be allotted to the Zeppelin Company.         100,000 to kept in  hand for general services and  emergencies.         200,000 to be placed towards the formation of an airship company.        The Government to pay to this airship company, on incorporation,  400,000,            being the first year&apos;s subsidy payment.  In this first stage it is proposed            to erect the necessary mooring masts and other plant and to build  one            airship of a capacity of five million cubic feet, this ship being utilised            for a service between  England and Egypt.    Second Stage.- As soon as the first stage has been completed and proof is forth-        coming that the Company can meet its obligations to the Government, His        Majesty&apos;s Government would be liable to pay the subsidy of  400,000  for        each of the next three years.  The capital of the airship  company would        then  be  raised  to  1,700,000,  partly by  discounting the Government        subsidies to assist in raising a  portion of the capital and  partly by  the        addition of approximately  150,000  new  capital  from the company&apos;s        resources.  The completion of this stage should provide a weekly service       i from  England to  India.    Third Stage.- When the second stage has been completed and the  results proved        to  be satisfactory,  the capital of the company would be  increased to         3,000,000 by a similar obligation on His Majesty&apos;s Government to pay  the        next three 3^ears&apos;  subsidy, and another addition of  150,000 from outside        sources.  The  completion of the whole scheme should provide  a bi-weekly        service to India.
    13, In our opinion the advantages accruing to His Majesty&apos;s Government fromthis procedure by stages are very great.  The financial liability of  His Majesty^Government at the outset is limited to  400,000 and is not increased until proof is forthcoming  of the  practicability of  the  scheme;  each  subsequent  increase  inliability being again dependent on the results achieved by the company.    14. &quot;We have given in this Report only the outlines of the scheme  proposed byLieutenant-Commander Burney.   It  will, without doubt,  be  necessary to includemany conditions and safeguards in  any agreement that may be reached with acommercial company.   We are of the  opinion, however, that before further progressin the negotiations can profitably be made, it is essential that a decision should bereached by His Majesty&apos;s Government  as to the  extent of the maximum financialliability they  are  prepared  to incur  in order  to maintain a  Commercial AirshipService, and whether an agreement on the lines  broadly indicated above  would prove acceptable.   We have accordingly decided to forward, for  the  consideration ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government,  the  conclusions we have reached at this stage, with a request that instructions may  be given to us  as regards  the continuance  of thenegotiations.    15. We have reached the following conclusions :     (1.) That it is preferable that the development of airships should be proceeded           with by means of a subsidy to a commercial firm rather  than  by direct           expenditure by His Majesty&apos;s Government through the Air Ministry.    (2.) That the Treasury, in consultation with the Admiralty and Air Ministry,           should be  empowered to  enter  into negotiations  with  Lieutenant-           Commander C. D. Burney for the  formation of a commercial airship           service on  the following  general terms,  the  financial liability of His           Majesty&apos;s   Government  to  be , reduced  during  the  negotiations,  if           possible :            (a.) His Majesty&apos;s Government to  guarantee a  subsidy on  the basis  of                 the  Hambling scheme of   400,000 a year  for  seven years, the                 payment of this subsidy  to be divided  into three- stages (see                 paragraph 12).  Satisfactory results to be attained at each stage                 before  proceeding with the next payment.           (6.) Fee payments to be paid by His Majesty&apos;s Government  to the company                 for  services rendered on the basis of  250,000 a year for a six-shig                 service to  India,   Any  fee  payments earned  during  the  first                 seven years from the time of  the first subsidy payment should not                 actually be paid by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but should reduce                . by the amount earned the sum eventually repayable by  the company                 under the Hambling scheme.           (c.) The repayment of the subsidy by  the company  to commence when a                 period of.seven, years has  elapsed from the  date  of  the first                 payment,  &quot; This repayment  to  be  limited to half the profits in                 excess of 10 per cent.-           (d.) His Majesty&apos;s Government  to  transfer all existing airships and                 airship material to the company and to lease the airship bases at                 Pulham and Cardington to  the company at a nominal  sum.  In                 the event of failure by the company these bases to  be returned  to                 His Majesty&apos;s Government; any improvements and additions that                 may have been added by the company being paid for  at a valuation.           (e) Conditions and safeguards, of a nature considered to  be satisfactory                 by the Government  Departments concerned, to  be included in any                 agreement reached with the company.           (/.) The agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government  and the company                 to be limited to a period of fifteen years.           (g.) In the event of His  Majesty&apos;s Government deciding  against the                 subsidising of a commercial company, the Air Ministry to resume                 airship research and experiment.                                    II   (Initialled)      S. H.                                          N  &quot;On behalf of the Sub-Committee.    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.  1,          July 10,1923.
