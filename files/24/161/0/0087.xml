Period ended August 10,  1923.            SUMMARY  OF  UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.    The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as whollyunemployed at the 6th August was 1,191,826,  a decrease of 3,668 on the previousweek.                 POSITION  IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.    The Bristol pits have been busy on the production of steam coal.  Short-time has been worked in a few collieries in the Gloucester district.   The industry showssome improvement in the Midlands.  Employment in the Yorkshire fields has beenbrisk, but operations have not yet been resumed at the Maltby Main Colliery. Therehas been a further decline in Lancashire, resulting in extended short-time  working.Collieries in all the important centres in Scotland have been working at  their full capacity. Trade is still quiet in Wales.IRON AND STEEL.    The situation in the Midlands is still unsettled,  with no sign o  improvement.It is reported that the shortage of orders has compelled some employers to extend theannual holidays of their workpeople.  Unemployment on the North-East Coast hascontinued to increase, and there are indications that several furnaces will be dampeddown  if orders are  not more numerous. The depression in Scotland has  not  been relieved; employment is intermittent and the outlook uncertain.   In Wales generally,there is a tendency towards reduction of output, due principally to slackness in thetinplate trade.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.    There has again been very little activity  in the yards on the South and South-West  Coast.  The absence  of any settlement of the  industrial dispute among theboilermakers has resulted in stagnation  on the North-East Coast. Employment hasbeen found for a number of  men in the repair yards on the Merseyside,  but the con-tinuance of the boilermakers&apos; dispute has retarded constructional work.  There is thepossibility of a further increase  in unemployment in Scotland, where the disputecontinues to exercise a depressing  effect.  The improvement in South Wales has been maintained.ENGINEERING.    There has been no  indication of any improvement in London and the HomeCounties, where the industry continues  in an  unsettled state.  The improvement inthe South-Western Counties has continued on the whole, but trade is still slack at afew centres.  The motor and cycle section in the Midlands has completed its period
of seasonal activity,  and numbers of workpeople have already  been suspended, butin general engineering the recent improvement has been maintained in some areas.In Yorkshire and the North of England there has been no further improvement inthe general outlook;  the situation in certain areas has reacted to some extent owingto the dispute among the boilermakers.  In Lancashire firms engaged in textile andgeneral engineering  have  remained  slack,  and are  discharging workpeople at intervals.   The  position in Scotland is still unfavourable.  The improvement in wales has continued.TEXTILES.    Cotton. In Lancashire, production in the American spinning section has beencurtailed to such an  extent that very  few mills are producing more than half  their normal  output.   In the weaving  section, a  slight improvement  is  perceptible incertain  manufacturing districts.  Generally the  trade fluctuates  considerably,  andit is impossible to forecast developments.  The depression in Yorkshire has not been relieved.    Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. Generally, the hosiery trade in the Midlandshas been slack.   In  the woollen and worsted industry the severe depression hascontinued in the West Riding of Yorkshire, while in  Scotland the  decline continueswith no prospect of any immediate improvement.    Lace.-This industry  is suffering from  depression in  both  Devonshire  andNottinghamshire.    Silk. Employment in the Midlands  is still very poor, but in Cheshire the weather conditions have benefited trade.    Jute. Employment in Scotland has reached its highest level, and it may shortly be necessary to reduce working hours.BUILDING.    The steady  progress has continued, and the demand for skilled operatives hasbeen maintained.BOOT  AND  SHOE.    Slackness is fairly general in London and the Home Counties, and the depressionin the South-Western Counties has  continued.  Trade in the Midlands varies at theseveral centres, but in a few areas the position is satisfactory.GLOTHING.    A slump has occurred in London and the Home Counties. In the South-western counties the recent improvements in the tailoring and dress-making trades have been maintained, but at the present period of the year trade  is normally quiet.   the wholesale clothing trade in the Midlands is, on the whole, satisfactory.POTTERY  AND GLASS.    Trade at most of the  pottery  centres in the Midlands is  only fair, but  somebranches of the industry are busy. A break-down has occurred at a firm in Yorkshireengaged in glass-bottle manufacture.TRANSPORT.   There  has been little change in the situation  at the London Docks,*  as theindustrial dispute among transport workers is still in progress.  The suspension offood materials at the docks is exercising an adverse  effect on firms engaged in themanufacture  of foodstuffs.  The dispute at the docks  on the South-West and North-East Coast has practically terminated, and the men who have returned to work havebeen very busy in dealing with arrears.  The recent improvement in South wales has not  been maintained except at Swansea.                                            C.  A. MONTAGUE  BARLOW,                                                   Ministry of Labour.* The men returned for work on Tuesday, August 21, but the position is not yet normal.

SUMMARY OF  ACTION TAKEN.                       [From Autumn 1920 onwards.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee.    The  prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident  in tbe early autumn of 1920.    On the 13th August,  1920, the then Cabinet appointed anUnemployment  Committee to  consider the whole question  and devise means for relieving unemployment.  This Committee continued to function till October 1922.The  present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee  on the1st November, 1922.                       (A.)  Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope  came into operation on the8th November, 1920.  The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4, Q00,000 previously.  Subsequent amendingActs modified the conditions as regards  rates of  benefit, extended the periods ofbenefit and increased the contributions.   As from November 1921 the Unemployed.Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provisionfor grants in respect of wives,  dependent husbands and children, and imposed aspecial levy to provide for  these grants.   The Unemployment Insurance Act, 192Aamalgamated the dependants&apos;  grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the  sp^1^levy with the&apos;Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extended until June 1J26the special periods during which benefit might be drawn.  The authority to  borrow
money from the Treasury was  increased  to   30,000,000.   By the UnemploymentInsurance Act, 1923, which came into operation on the 12th April,  1923, the specialperiods for the payment of benefit have been extended to  October 1923.   special provision has also been made by this Act for the following year to October 1924.TABLE showing  amount paid out in  Unemployment Benefit  (including  Benefit in    respect  of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th    November, 1920, to the 4th August, 1923.    1.

(B.)  Emergency Works  and  other  Measures.    A full statement of the measures taken  in the autumn of 1920 and of the latermeasures from autumn 1921  onwards  has been set out in previous issues  of thisReport.  At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at  various times, and at the present time over 130,000 men are employed, exclusive of the workprovided for  men in ancillary occupations  and  the  effect  of the Export  credits scheme.        (C.)  Extensions of Remedial Measures during the Winter 1922-23.    Some of the measures comprised in (B)  above are still in operation, e.g., pastsanctions of  grants by  the Unemployment Grants  Committee and the. Ministry ofTransport.  The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes  approved under theTrade Facilities Act are in progress.    In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transportissued circular letters to Local Authorities  inviting  them to submit  schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the  relief of unemployment in their&apos; respective areas.  Approved  schemes areassisted by grants made on the same bases as  heretofore.  In the case of schemesassisted by the  Unemployment Grants  Committee,  particulars of  grants already sanctioned are set out below.    In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circularletters to County Councils  (except  the London  County Council) and DrainageAuthorities, inviting them to  submit  schemes of land drainage which, if approved,might be assisted on fundamentally the  same conditions as  those  aoplicable in the      [10495]                                                         E  3

All  applications were to bereceived in the  case  of Drainage Authorities  on or  before  December  1, 1922,and in  the  case  of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on  or  before december 16,  1922.   County Councils were also  circulated with regard  to schemesfor the supply of water  to farms, the conditions  of assistance from the Ministry ofAgriculture and  Fisheries remaining substantially the same as the previous winter,with the exception that  the Ministry, instead of&apos; advancing the whole cost ot  any scheme and recovering a proportion from  the owners  concerned, will  make grants to cover part  only of the total cost of each scheme.   Operations on these schemesceased after the 16th June, 1923.  Particulars of grants sanctioned We shown below(see III, item 6).    On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of  Labour, in the House of Commons,outlined, the manner in  which measures taken by the late Government would becontinued and extended.    The additional sums  promised in extension of existingfunds are set out below :                                                     D                                                                            Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of        60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ...       ...       ...       ...      600,000    Land Drainage  &apos;      ...       ...       ...     -  ...       ...      170,000    Afforestation  ...       ...      ...       ...       ...       ...      100,000    Acceleration of Government contracts         Office of Works   ..........          375,000        General  Post Office        ...       ...          946,000                                                       -     1,321,000    It was  also then  announced that guarantees under the  Trade Facilities  ActScheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that theExport Credits Scheme   would  be  extended if  necessary;   and that  the  LocalAuthorities  concerned would be  asked to  co-operate  in putting in  hand  the manchester-Liverpool Road, which  would  involve  an  expenditure  of  about 3,000,000,  half of it from the Road Fund.    In December 1922,  the  Unemployment  Grants Committee issued  a furthercircular letter  to Local Authorities inviting them to  submit schemes suitable  forassistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of whichis normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan.  The conditions  under which grants may  be sanctioned are substantially the same  as those previously in&apos; force,except that in  the case of Rural Districts  the  Committee have discretion to allow,where  clearly  necessary,  a modification of the conditions regarding the giving ofpreference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the  engagement of labour through theEmployment Exchanges.   ; On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons,further announced that,  in addition to the acceleration of contracts  by the PostOffice and Office  of Works, previously described, the  Admiralty  would  acceleratemiscellaneous works to a  total of about  365,000;  whilst the Home Office would  pufin hand certain  accelerated building work,  together with repairs to  buildings,including Police Stations.   &apos; On the  13th  December, 1922, the Forestry  Commission issued a  press notice tothe effect  that forestry grants were available  for the relief  of unemployment onthe same general conditions as those applicable to grants made during the previouswinter.  The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes  in  Crown Forests and for  additional work in the Commission^ Forests.   Operations  on  these schemes ceased after  the30th June, 1923.    By the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted onthe 15th December, 1922,  formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregatecapital amount of loans the principal or interest of which may be guaranteed underthe Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000  to  50,000,000.
