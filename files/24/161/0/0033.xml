Interesting details regarding the  Communist Party ofGreat Britain and the British Bureau of the Red  Internationalof Labour Unions were given at a meeting of the  Prof internheld in Mosoow on June 7th.    The majority of British delegates  to the Moscowoonferenoes have now returned to this country.    There has been no cessation of communist propaganda inconnection with the dockers&apos; strike.  t  The British Bureau of the Red International of Labourunions has issued a secret memorandum entitled &quot;Work on TradesCouncils&quot;:  this organisation is working actively among&quot;Embers of the South Wales Miners1 Federation.
     fv.ll reports of the conference held in Moscow on juae 25th to consider the position of the British Coismunist party are not yet to hand &quot;but It ia hoped that fairly complete information regarding it will he Obtained shortly.     On July 12th J.$. Walton UewbOld, M.P., sent the following comments regarding the British Conference to an important proTincial communist          &quot;We had a big palaver over by but I 66 not think     there will be so drastic an overhauling immediately *     tho&apos; it will come eventually.

It was quite     adequate to the needs and,,, when I returned there was the      100 salary waiting,,  Could, you, ho?^ever, stand out     for repayment for a few wooks?  I am expecting some     further relief shortly anti cannot quite size up my     expenditure till tho end of the Session.&quot;     Some, at least, of the dependents of the British delegates to Moscow are in receipt of an allowance from the Communist Party of Great Britain:  on July 13th, for example,  3.10.0. &quot;for this week&quot; was sent to Bob Stewart&apos;s wife in Dundee.     Tho Chief Constable of Dundee informs me that, at a local communist meeting on July 8th, Cuslck frankly admitted:-           That the Communist Party headquarters were in     Moscow and that all instructions were given from     there, all the world ever and as members of the     Communist Party hero they must act up to instructions     sent from there, otherwise they ware no good as     membe rs.    The following circular has been sent by the PoliticalSecretary of the Communist Party to &quot;District Party

however,  was not neglected entirely,  as will &quot;be seen fromthe following letter sent by David Ramsay,  a leadingmember of the underground communist organisation, to J.I.Kurphy,  who is acting as political secretary of theCommunist Party during Bell&apos;s absence:          &quot;You have let me in for something.  This     morning I made an attempt to establish contact and     after sending in for two of the  boys who were not     there I was obliged to ask for Homa Ablett.  He saw     Jack Thomas,  whc promised to get together the     supporters by this evening - but forgot to do it.     Anyway he has not turned up.  To-morrow all the     delegates go  to Boulogne for the day arid I shall     have to go too if I em to see any of them.  that&apos;s     why I have not wired for &quot;Worksre&apos; Weekly1 - there     would be no one here to buy -* bub a couple of. quire     won&apos;i2 go wrong for Thursday morning.          &quot;Altogether there are only  about six or so here     who are any good to us for organising.purposes.     ITrn hoping for the best..&quot;                   The issue of the &quot;workers1 Dreadnought&quot;dated July 14th contains an article entitled &quot;To the Minersof Great Britain&quot; from &quot;which the following extracts are taken:                  j          &quot;You have been stalled and  banked again     by that growing voice of labour, so vociferously     and speciously proclaimed by the Parliamentary     careerists within your ranks...          &quot;In the very nature of things, the policy of     no policy, the continual seeking of some&apos;alternative     measure to solve the problem that confronts you,     undermines your morals end rends your ranks with     hopeless helplessness, when seemingly the gospel with     which your traducers spell you is in verity the     gospel of hope...          &quot;In the immediate or near future you will be forced     to a resumption of the struggle  of wage schedules.          &quot;The A.W.R.C (All Workers&apos; Revolutionary Union     of Workshop Committees) is considering an intensive     propaganda for organising the factory,  mine, field,     marine and fisheries&quot; workers of Ireland and Greau     Britain into a federated whole,  to seise and operate     industry and  distribute the products of labour, field,     mine, factory and sea, to the common needs and     requirements of the workers...          &quot;There are no funds;  we are not  organising for

The  revolutionary truth has     few spokesmen.,.          &quot;,.,To  a  student  of capitalist development and     the forces,  and elements and  antagonisms arising     therefrom.   Great Britain  is  pre-eminently the     country in which, the  forces have latently matured     for the abolition of Capitalism.          &quot;It,  and  it  alone,  is the  key to  world     Capitalism1s collapse.  Tho travelled  intellectuals a     year masters know it,  if it has not dawned into the     head of parliamentary  Communists...&quot;     On July 12th dole gates of  the Transport &amp; GeneralWorkers1 Union, in  session  in London,, opposed,  by alargo majority, affiliation to  the Third In tarnations 1,-     Some of the  more  important communists  includingWilliam Gee  and George Ebury are dissatisfied with theExecutive of the  Communist  Party.-   Referring to WilliamGee&apos;s attitude  towards that body,  Bbury wrote recently:          &quot;The  dmd.  cool indifference in relation to     myself  is  not  calculated to make one loyal,  and     if I did not remember  that I&apos;m a communist first,-     I believe, that  I too  would rebel.&quot;     The Quarterly  Business -Aggregate ifeeting of theSouth West London Local was held on July 14th:   the notifications sent  out regarding this meeting contained the following commands:          &quot;Attendance  at these  meetings is  compulsory,          &quot;Anyone absolutely unable  to be present must     give an explanation either verbally to his Group     leader  or  by letter to me.&quot;     It would appear that attempts are being made tosmuggle into this country  large quantities  of literatureissued by the Communist International in Moscow.    It willbe remembered that  a seizu.ro  of such literature was madeat the London docks on July 2nd (Report Ho,  214).   TheChief Constable of  Cardiff  now  informs me that  on june 15th a  seiauro  of similar  literature was made on                                                  the /
                                                   a member the Russian S.S.  &quot;Ispolkom&quot; at Port T&amp;lbot,  Paul Belinsky/ of the  Industrial Workers of the World acknowledged that it belonged to him:   when questioned he admitted that he was e bolshevik and a native of Petrograd:  his statement that the literature was for his own use would seem to be disproved by the  fact that he was in possession of, at least,  three uncut oopies of twenty-two Communist International publication.      Another seisure of bolshevik literature is reported to have been made on the y.S* &quot;Helens Blumfeld&quot; by Customs in South Shields:  this literature w^s stated to have been handed  to a seaman named H. Freide from a motor boat which ot:me alongsido the 3.S. &quot;Eeleno Blumfeld&quot; before it left.

The feeling among a proportion of the  footers is becoming bitter and the men appear more inclined  to listen to agitators who profess to sympathise with  ^hetn:   persistent efforts have been made &quot;by communists   0 extend the  strike, and special attention has been paid   0 the men at Tilbury docks.      Each dey the effect of tho stril-3 on industry becomes   ^craasingiy evident:  ships ere held up, cargoes are                                              rotting/

Police have &quot;been obliged to draw their truncheons atthe London Locks and a reliable correspondent who  hasclosely followed the trend of events emphatically  declares that if the employers&apos; carry out their proposal  to employ&quot;black-leg&quot; labour-, the men on  strike will resort  torioting and other means of violence.     The lavish scale of relief paid to the strikers by  certainBoards of Guardians and the acceptance by the UnofficialStrike Committee of the assistance of the organisedunemployed are factors contributing to the prolongation  ofthe strike:  the leaders of the unemployed are advocatingno compromise and a more effective system of picketing thewharves and docks.   With regard to the administration of out-relief an article entitled &quot;Go to the Guardians - Don&apos;tStarve&quot;, whioh appeared in the second issue of &quot;TheDocker&quot; dated: July 15th, is not without interest:          &quot;The bosses have never won a strike yet  except     by using the weapon of starvation.  The obvious thing     to do, therefore, is not to starve if there is any     possible way of finding the food your well-fed     officials refuse to vote you.  If the Uiiion....re fuses     you money go to the Guardians.  It has been done in     some distriots - why not in yours?          &quot;A deputation has been to the West-Ham Guardians     and the following rate has been promised:-                    . 10s. Man;                     10s. Wife;                      5s. one Child;                     up to 15s. for ;Re&apos;nt,     with a maximum of  3. 4. 6.&quot; per week per family.          The&quot;&apos;poplar Guardians have also conceded  the full     rate granted to the -unemployed. -&apos;&quot;&apos;seo; your Labour     member, appoint your deputation, and; get all  you     can.  The wives, and kiddies must get their grub.  Do     this and the strike is as good as won.&quot;     On July 16th Eillip, Chairman of the West Em Board of Gxxardians, urged the men to remained?i out and told  them  that they would be paid the maximum out-door relief.

It is the will of the rank-and-file which is being expressed., -Our Committees must express this will of the rank-and-file or bo deposed or repudiated.     &quot;And wo say to all other workers, you are in thesame boat as ourselves.          &quot;You, like us, are up against it.

    of our own union, who  are running  the  I.G.O.G.    Services  in London are  to have wage cuts.  You,-    railwayman, ere  threatened with wage cuts.   Yon,    printers, who enable   your bosses  to publish the    ridiculous lies  shout  us in  their  papers, arc    threatened with  wage cuts by the end of.  the  year    after having undergone  severe defeats  already.  You,    builders;  you miners;  you, engineers,  are  all in    for it sooner or later  - having already  received    considerable bashing,  .         &quot;There is not a section of the workers  in any    industry  who are not immadiatoly menaced with a    lowering  of their standard of living or.  an increase    in their  working hours0         &quot;The capitalists  intend that  this wage-siashing  -    this forcing of  the workers  down to the  lowest depths -    shall go  on and,  on.         &quot;They take  us workers by sections in order to the    more easily defeat usv         It is our turn now, but it will be  your turn    to-morrow or the day after to-morrow.         &quot;So we appeal to  you to prevent blaeklsgging,    to join with us  in a general struggle against all  wage    reductions, and  to in  ovary  way demonstrate  your    solidarity.,..         &quot;So, set your teeth, boys..  Keep  the fight going.    Every hour the strike  continue a the bosses are    fesling it in the place that hurts them most - their    pockets^&quot;    Many Lockers, including a number who definitely statedthat they wished to have nothing  to do  with communism,approaohed Tom Mann on July  13th  to take over the leadership of the strike:  a letter written by Mann on the same day to the south Vfales Divisional Organiser of the CommunistParty throws light on Tom Mann!s  attitude:         &quot;At  several meetings of the Strikers without  my    knowledge thsy decided  to ask. me to step into the    fight and thsy want me  at once,  I have promised a    deputation that  I will  investigate the position    to-morrow and if I consider there  is a fighting    chance will throw in with them.  This will make it    unlikely that I  shall be able, to reach the Cardiff and    Barry Meetings,  in which pass a spsaker will  be sent    along from King  Street  to take my place.&quot;  -.  Still  another Unofficial  Strike  Committee  is  reportedhave  been  formed:   it  is  composed  of  39  trade union                                            members/
members, consisting of 13 dockers,  13 stevedores and 13lightermen:  this Committee, which states th;:t it will have nothing to do with &quot;communists and other irresponsible sM,has informed the tJhipping Federation that it ie the onlybody authorised to negotiate on behalf of the strikers andthat it is ready to oonsider any proposal from that bodythat can be put before the men as a basis for returning towork.     On July loth whilst police were escorting three motorvans laden with bananas from Medland Wharf,. Regent&apos;a CanalDock along Commercial Road,  they were attacked by a large body of strikers who stoned  them and the motor drivers withgranite sets from the road repairing stacks of stones.   Thepolice drew their truncheons and dispersed the crowd andthe motor lorries proceeded.   George Boyoe, aged 25,of 42,Fair Street, Stepney, was arrested  and  charged withinsulting behaviour and Albert Bowers Corbet, aged 49,  of18, Uevonport Street, stepney,  was charged with being drunkand disorderly and assaulting P.C.

Strike  eaidi                      Ihere  were but few people  who  really                 understood the position at  all and he  was                 not afraid to say Hut there was only  one                 person  who did thoroughly understand it                 and that was himself.   He had  bean engaged                 on variousstrike committees aince their                 inoeption, had voluntarily  given his advice                 and assistance to every one and  had  been                 eeleoted to  interview  &quot;She Doctors K.C. and                 his fellow oocspiratorn on  the question.                 He could say even now  that  the strike  was                 one brought  by the  workers  thornselves  and                 the men were still  determined  to carry on                 until a living and  respectable wage  wad                 assured them.  It should be obvious  to all                 that these men had  a good case because it                 ought to be  patent  to  every one  that the                 Board of Trade figures regarding the cost                 of living  were all  wrong and the present                 purchasing power of wages did  not permit                 the lowering of  any workers wage.  The                 Railwaymen,  the  Building and Engineering                 workers would shortly  feel  the pinoh and                 then when  their  tarn came would  have to    ;                 turn and ask themselves why they had not                 come to the  aid  of  the dockers and thereby                 have saved the situation for themselves.               &apos;  It has  been  said that  the Red  Hand was the                 cause ef the Dockers&apos;  Strike.  Well  he                 hoped it was so;be*ause it  was high  time                 that the worker  realised that  the  Communist                 and the worker were &quot;synonymous terms.  As a                 matter  of  fact he would go  a step  further                 and say that already it was impossible to -:&apos;                 get any set  of real workers together without                 the Red Rbnd being  present, but  in this                 strike  it  was not present in the manner    i&apos;                 meant by the Capitalist Press j he, however,                 hoped it would be when the  inevitable     a                 national general strike took place,.,  ,     gran els Arthur Ofoan at a meeting  at Tower, Hill  on     &quot;*  &quot; &apos; &apos;&apos;  &quot; &quot; &apos;July IHb, where the audienoe  numbered 800,                 said:               *,:             &apos;          j-                     &quot;If you (dock strltors) had remained in                 the docks, and done damage., you  would have                 done the best thing possible.

Nor ah Smyth addressed a meeting held under the ausploes                of the Unemployed Workers&apos; Organisation at                Victoria Park on July 16th:  the audience                numbered about 50:  in the course of her                remarks Smyth said:                      The Dock strike now in progreisewas the                most important move that the working class had                taken for many many years.  It ahowed that                the oppressed workers no longer trusted                their leaders but that they were prspared to                work out their own salvation.  It was a                genuine rank and file movement and she hoped                that all sections of the working class would                flock to their support.  In her opinion                nothing could solve the unemploynant problem                but the total and complete abolition of the                Capitalist system...   She ridiculed the idea                of the unemployed that their position was only                temporary and that matters would improve a3                trade was ro-established.  Why should they want                trade to improve?  This would only strengthen                the position of the capitalists whom they                dosired to eliminate,gnomploy&amp;a Workers1 Organisation    Bellamy at poplar on July 15 th said that tho Road Transport                Workers wore going to join the Dockers in the                strike and were at present considering the                question and would come to a decision to-morrow                He described the drivers of OH lorries passing                near the meeting as  &quot;black-legging end scabbing                on the Dockers and said they ought to do                something to tales steps to prevent this.  If a                few of these scabs were killed it would only be                what they deserve.McCormaok/

He paid tribute                  to the good work which was being done by  the                  Young Communist League and the Communist                  Sunday Schools in instilling the class hatred                  in the breasts of the young proletariat.    The following report has been received from acorrespondent:         &quot;The Dockers&apos; Strike is keenly affecting railwaymen    and it is a positive fact that if any attempt were made    to .reduce railwayman&apos;s wages,1 the same would happen among  .    them.  Quite a good proportion of them, stimulated by    oertaln Communists, would be willing to join the Dockers    now and refuse to aocept the reductions now being    discussed.  They thoroughly distrust the Board of Trade    figures and if there were any means of objecting, they    would certainly adopt them.&quot;HBP INTERNATIONAL OP LABOUR ONIONS     The following interesting report has been received from a foreign source:                  &quot;MEETING OP THE RED INTERNATIONAL OP          &quot;(1)    The  Session was  entirely devoted to the     situation regarding the working  classes in England.

aria the  member of the Executive Committee of the Cominternfrom England,  MacManus.     &quot;Losoveky, who presided, stated that this day&apos;a sessionwas only a preparatory one to get generally acquainted withthe situation ih England, and that both at a meeting of  ;the Enlarged Executive of the Comintern, and at a Sessionof the Central Soviet of the Profintern on the 85th June,the question of the situation in England would be discussed in detail.     &quot;(2)   Gallagher and pollitt read a report on thework of the Communist Party.     &quot;(The English Communist party is very weak, and has no great influence with the Trades Unions.     &quot;To secure better contact with the masses, the partymust act conjointly with the labour Party, and must carryon its own policy of stirring up class warfare verycautiously by winning over  sympathisers in the trades union.     &quot;At the present time the number of supporters of  theRed Profintern is continuously increasing.     &quot;The greatest results  in this direotion have been achieved in the  following Trades UnionsMiners Union            30$ are supporters ef the Prof internRailwayman&apos;s Union      24$                 &quot;Transport Workers Union 2SMetalworkers&apos;  Union    16$                 rtMechanicians Union      15$                 n     &quot;At present, however,  the Labour Party and its leader^enjoy the confidence of, and have great influence over, theEnglish workmen,  and hence  it is very difficult to combat-;them.  The majority of the  workmen favour a legal and loyaloonfliot in Parliament, and it flatters their pride thatthe Labour Party and its leaders are regarded in parliament as an influential opposition.     M(3)   Brown (Michael  Borodin) then made a reporton the unemployed:     &quot;!The measures taken by the English Government,especially with the coming into office of sonar Law&apos;cabinet, reduced unemployment, and weakened the UnemploymentMovement, which under the influence of the Communist party,had began to take an organised form.     &apos;&quot;In England (including Wales) the communist partyin February 1923, could count on 250,000 unemployed, whorally supported it, and were ready for open action.  Theaoute state of  unemployment has now passed, and hence thevpnmuniet Party must seek new tactical measures inPropagating its iaeas.&apos; of        &apos;iiiTQQ speakers pointed out that all the efforts Qr the English  Communist Party must be directed to winning
   over the Trades Unions and to agitating for the   incorporation of individual Workmen&apos;s Unions in the   profintern.  The Communist Party in itself has too little   riotmlarity among the working masses, and is so Insignificant   in* numbers (7,160 members on 1st Hay 19 23) that in the next   few years it can hardly play a decisive role in directing   the movement of the English proletariat.        &quot;(4)   On Lozovsky&apos;s proposal, the following   resolutions were passed:-   (a)   That a Special Conference on the English question         be held with the consent of the Executive Committee         of the Communist International, to enable a detailed         judgment of the situation in England to be arrived         at, and to work out a programme of action for the         near future.   (b)   This Conference to work out, in conformity with         instructions given by the Communist  International, a-&apos;         nrograrame for &quot;the work of the Communist Party, and the         Bed profintern in England.   (c)   &apos;Bie Executive Bureau considers that  all efforts, both         of the British Communist Party, and  also of         supporters of the Proflntarn in England, must be         directed solely to the organisation, in every         separate Trades Union, of e Germ-cell of supporters  of         the profintern.       &quot;In addition the desire of the English Delegates for   the publication in England (even if weekly) of a periodical;   organ of the prof intern was noted.     .  &quot;Tliis matter will be referred to the Comintern and the   Prof intern to decide the question of assigning credits   for a subsidy for this publication.  Detailed reports   regarding the situation in England will be made at the   Enlarged Executive of the Comintern, and at the session of   the Central  soviet of the prof intern on S5th  June.&quot;   In order to c reate a  &quot;United Front against War and Fascism&quot;-be Mid-European  Bureau of the Red International of Labourfaiona has instructed &quot;all organisations and oppositionminorities affiliated with the Red International of Labour Unions&apos;&apos;  oonoentrate on this matter between now and the executive        the  sting of /Amsterdam Federation of Trade Unions which is to be  16 on August 3rd and 4th.  The British Bureau has been informed  &apos; *e Mid-European Bureau in a document marked &quot;Confidential -  * for publications that:        &quot;On the agenda of this meeting there will be the    racent proposal of the Central Committee of the All-Russian    Federation of Trade Unions to arrange a common conference
- 15 -286    in  order to create a united front against war  and    Fascism.   Up  to  then,  we  must  carry out  everywhere and    under  all  circumstances  a most energetic oampaign,  we    must &quot;bring to bear the utmost  pressure  on the  organisations    affiliated to Amsterdam  - beginning with the  single    Unions up  to  the National Federations and  Trade Union    Centres -  in  order to  make  them adopt resolutions    requesting the formation of  the baited Front  and overwhelm    Amsterdam  with these.   It is  necessary to  use all our    influence  in  order to  make  the rank and  file  of the    Amsterdam organisations  put pressure on their leaders before    and during the Meeting of their Executive.         &quot;This, com redes, is the  most  urgent political task    of all revolutionary  trade  union groups in the next    future.  It is our own energy, our  own capacity to create the    necessary  commotion among the  rank  and  file that will    to  a certain  extent  determine  the stand  taken by the    Amsterdam Executive  towards the proposal of the All    Russian Federation of  Trade  Unions,   Every single    revolutionary group has the  duty to do its part so that    from all quarters the  cry for the United Battle Front    against ever-growing reaction and Militarism rises...         &quot;We request you to  inform us immediately of all    measures taken by you concerning this matter.&quot;    &quot;The Worker&quot;  has obeyed  the  behests of its masters and  inthe  issue of July  7th quotes a communication sent  on thisBtbject by the  Russian Trade  Unions to the Amsterdam TradeUnion Federation.    A  secret memorandum entitled &quot;Work  on Trades Councils&quot;  has been issued by  the British Bureau of the Red International oflabour  Unions:   extracts  from this document bear quotation:         &quot;Hie  most important work the adherents of the    R.I.L.U. can do just  now is work in connection with the    Trades Councils.         &quot;For some considerable time past the general tendency    has been to transform the Trades councils into electoral    machines:   into agencies for  securing the return  of    labour candidates to the municipal  bodies and to    Parliament,  Now, while  we agree that the political side of    working class activities should receive proper attention -    attention should be  given to the Industrial,  Educational,    co-operative and booial sides as well,         &quot;The Trades Council provides the means whereby ALB    SI! ^ &quot;s of the  affiliated organisations can be ^aiUled.    ^e Trades Council is the TRUE local working class body\    r*L?Ur 00?oePtion is that  the Trades Council should not    rarely rally their affiliated members for elections - but    ior every other working class burpose as well.  Ourconception/
 oonoeptlon of the  Trades  council  is  a body  which will nfitar  for EVERY side  of working class activity - industrial, political, Co-operative  ana  social;  ana for this purpose aH bona-fide  working class political, oo-operati-ve and Bocial  sna unemployed organisations  should si80 be affiliated to the Trades  Council -  as well  as the Trade Union branohes.   If tiiis ware  done  one powerful working class CENTRAL LOCAL BODY would be established, able  tomoblise  all  the organised workers for election purposes,  in the event of a strike or lock-out ana for propagandist  campaigns of all descriptions.  Such &amp; concentration and unification of  our foroes wouia aad tremendously to working  class power  in the  localities, and enable the workers to develop a conscious policy in     \ regard to all matters affecting their daily life.   The Trades Council, suoh.  as we  conceive  it,  should have politioal, industrial, co-operative  and  social sections unaer  the Jurisdiction of a General Executive.     &quot;It  ie ttiis idea which needs to be  pushed forward - not only  on the Trade Council but in the Trade union branohes  as well.   And  in  order  that this  idea -  this conception - should fleTOlop and bear fruit  in the  minds of the workers we urge YOU  to  do your  utmost to  make  the Trades-Council the leading  propagandist body  in YOUR looality.  The Trades Council should make every question unemployment, baa  housing,  the prevention of  War,  the winning of members for the  Traao  Unions, the formation of factory ana workshop  committees,  the satisfaction  of     t looal  needs - such as more  public baths or  public  parks I and open  spaces and the  clearing  of  slum area - a  reason. for continuous propaganda and opportunity for rallying the organised workers to meetings and demonstrations.   Up phase  of  the working  class  life should be neglected.   No? workers discontent should lack adequate  expression.      &quot;In  order to  forward this policy we urge you to secure your return as a  delegate  to your Trades Council. If you are already a  delegate we  urge you to join with such others as are on the Trade Council who are prepared to forward this policy.   More, we urge you to secure  the appointment of a  Trades  Counoil delegation  to visit all local organisations to express this  policy  and to secure the affiliation of those bodies not  already affiliated.&quot; The following extracts  are  taken  from a oiroular sent outTom Mann ana Hat Watkins  in June:-      &quot;It  is proposed  to  form  a London Council of the  !!v Internatiorial  of  Labour Unions  consisting of active adherents who are  prepared  to WORK under the  jurisdiction of the British Bureau, and  the London Committee.      &quot;The purpose  of  this Council is to  enable our aotive Biffattffsto Work along tho lines of a common policy, and in order  to  do that to have  periodio meetings, at least  once * month to elaborate  that policy.      &quot;At  these monthly meetings it  is proposed to  supply wie members with speakers notes,  memoranda, etc.,  to have, Sf*  discussions  on  the  subjects of:  Work in the  Trade; union  Branches, the Formation of  Factory Committees, the
    Development of the Trades  Councils, Trade Union-   .    Amalgamation  and  Industrial Unionism, the Functions of    the General Council of  the Trade Union  Congress, etc,    and to  so clarify and consolidate  our propaganda as to .    make  it mo3t  effective.  Also, and most important, to    create  a  common bond amongst  those active in  our work,    to enable us  all  to work together  as a  Team&apos;,  mutually    aiding.and supporting each other.          As we say, we desire  this Council  to he  a  Council    of Active Workers:-  of those who  are prepared  to    devote  what time  they can  to  our propaganda,  who would    he willing to speak in  Trade  Councils and Trade union    brnr.eh.os  if able, and generally  force, the pace  in  the    Organised Working Class movement of London,,r    On  July 9th Nat watkins wrote to the South  WalesDivisional Organiser of the  Communist party:          &quot;At  a meeting of tho  Bureau held on Friday last,    it was, on the re commend at :lon of Comrade Murphy to ask    you,to  do what possibly can  to get into touch with all    the elements  in the S.W,.M,F*  favourable to  R.I.L.U..    affiliation and to stimulate  them  to actively work    in  that direction.          &quot;We  are  sending along quantities of  &apos;A11 power    and the Resolutions and Decisions, also a few copies  of     the R.I.L.U.  constitutions,  so that  speakers  and  active    workers can be  in possession of  the requisite information    Also  we have  a  leaflet  in  course of preparation -  which    will  be available for distribution when the ballot    papers  are out.          &quot;The &apos;A11 Power&apos;a&apos; you  can  distribute  freely, only     in such a way as  not to interfere  with  our  sales  in     South Wales.          &quot;Kindly  keep us posted  as to  all that  transpires.v     Three days later  Watkins  again wrote  to the sameman:          &quot;The literature was sent by rail and you should have     received  it by the  time this  letter arrives,          &quot;Inclosed you will find a list  of  ComradeB who have     received  literature from  us  direct,   I  am sending  this     to prevent  overlapping.          &quot;We  will send  the  new leaflet to all the addresses     on this list  and  let you have a.further supply,&quot;     The  list  of names of &quot;comrades&quot;  supplied with literature &quot;as aa follows:     A.W.

The delegates will discuss and  analyze the work done      and the results achieved during the six months which      have passed since our  Third World Congress and in the      light of these experiences determine the tasks of the      sections till the next congress.           &quot;The Bureau meets in a time of great stress for      the revolutionary labour movement throughout the      world and its vanguard Soviet Russia, end the young      workers who return from it will carry with tham      weighty decisions, the realization of whioh will.      represent a step,towards the ultimate liberation of      labour and its youth from wage  slavery.  It will deal      mainly with the question of nuclei and everything      relating thereto, without which we oan never hope      to exert any influence among the masses of the      working olass youth, and with the antimilitarist      struggle, of so great importance for stemming the      tide of Fascism and all its ooncrete manifestations..      Another question whioh the Bureau Session will settle      is the final formulation of our program the basis of      which was adopted by the Third  Congress.&quot;      According to the July issue of  &quot;The Young Communist&apos;?:           &quot;A meeting of the league council was held in      London on Saturday and Sunday,  June 16th and 17th,      and was attended by comrades from Dundee, Birmingham,      Barrow, Edinburgh, Manchester,  Yorkshire ana London.           &quot;Among the most Important  subjects of discussion      was the present position of tke Exeoutive Committee.      Of the nine aomrades eleoted for this committee at      the last National Conference there are only three      remaining.  Labouring under this very heavy handicap      it is not surprising that the Exeoutive Committee      were not a leading committee in the true sense of theword./
     word.   The  League  Council resolved that  four Party     members be  drafted on to  the  Executive  Committee.     This decision was  accepted by the Executive  Committee     and endorsed by the Party...          &quot;One of the greatest drawbacks for  an organisation     euoh  as the Young  Communist League is the isolation     of the  Executive Committee members from the  membership     as a  whole,  and, in the League Council&apos;s opinion,  one     of the  reasons why the League has been  unable to  fulfil     its tasks has been the fact that  the Executive     Committee has had  no first-hand knowledge of the     strength  of our organisation.  When it  becomes     financially possible,  a definite  system of     organisational tours by  the various members of the     Executive Com&apos;ai5tee to the branches in  the country     must be undertaken.          &quot;The immediate task  of the Young Communist League     of Great  Britain is the training of its membership  in     the principles of  the Comunist movement.   without     this  training and  the necessary understanding of  thd     principles  underlying our organisation  we oannot     properly  hope to oarry on that work whioh is necessary     for winning loadership of the masses of the  young     workers.  Definite League Training Groups will be     started on  the basis of the Syllabus now being prepared     and advantage will be taken of the Party Training     Groups  for  districts where it is  not possible to  run     League  Training Groups.     J.T.  Murphy represented  the Communist Party of GreatBritain at this  meeting and the following account is given of his speech:          &quot;The amicable spirit displayed by  Russia in  the     recent crisis with Great  Britain was not due to     Russia&apos;s  weakness, but it was due to our own weakness.&quot;     Russia is now stronger and more stable  than ever     before, but the position  of the working class in     Europe  is exceptionally weak and  reaction is in the     ascendanto   Therefore, we must enter boldly into     the working-class  fight here, whilo Russia consolidates     her position.  In  the working class fight the Young     Communist League of Great Britain can do its share.     Apprentices have become  a form of cheap  labour,     and  Comrade Murphy urged  the  Young Communist League     to concentrate upon the  organisation of apprentices as     being one of the biggest  problems it has to face0     Get  them  Into the  Unions  and  when that  is accomplished,     see  that  the Youth have a voice in the  affairs of the     unions     The League  Council decided that,  beginning with the august issue the name of their organ will be  changed from&quot;The Young Communist&quot; to &quot;The  Young Worker&quot;  ana the priceincreased  to 2d,                                                     The/

On July 16th, at a meeting held under the auspices  of thenew  unemployed organisation in Victoria Bark,  Johns of Poplarffiaclo a not uninteresting attack on the leaders of the NationalUnemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement:   ho called thornopportunists who only worked for 3aIf-aggrandisement and accusedthem of having climbed to positions &quot;on the backs of thounemployed dupes&quot;.   Recalling the mar oh of the unemployed fromthe  Provinces last year, Johns said that this was but a  form ofadvertisement for the leaders of tho National unemployed Workers&apos;Coaeittee Movement vtho, by blinking off&quot; hud missed a great                                                 opportunity/

Ifl  opportunity when  &quot;80,000 unemployed&quot;  were  mustered on the  Embankment,    The  National  Unemployed Workers&apos;  Committee  Movement had been  exploited  &quot;by various political parties and  had  been especially controlled by the Communist Party of  Groat  Britain.       The National  Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement is  reported to  be  losing money  steadily:   Bills  amount  to   80:  the  income  for the week-ending  July 6th  was  la 13.9.  as compared  with the  former  weekly income  of  10 -  16:   at  one  time 45  branches in  the  London Area were affiliated  to  this body:   at  present only  nine  branches  buy  contribution  cards  regularly.fffl EE VP LUCE reactionary ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIN  .       Irish  extremists in England  are  lying low just now: few  meetings are being held  and  very  little, even  in the  way of  propaganda,  is  being done.   Art  0&apos;Brien&apos;s  friends,  are  trying to  raise the cry  -that he  is being improperly treated  in prison  but their efforts  in this direction  are attracting  very little  attention.   It is understood that  both he and  Soan McGrath are  appealing against their sentences.      0&apos;Brien&apos;s  enemies are still  hammering away at his  financial  duplicity,  as  disclosed in  his oross-examination.  Charles Diamond has a strong article  in the  &quot;Catholic  Herald&quot; this week  in which he says:-            &quot;Never,  in our opinion,  was there  such open and      unabashed  abuse  of  the  confidence of  the  Irish in      Great Britain as in this matter,            &quot;No wonder the unselfish patriots  who were      fingering  such largo sums desired the movement to      go on..&quot;       The present leaders of  the  Irish Self-Determination  League seem  to  be  playing up more and more to  their new  allies, the  Communists.

Irish Republicans in Scotland  have been extremelyquiet during the week owing possibly to the absence ofmany of them who have taken advantage of the Glasgow FairHolidays to visit their friends in Ireland.
