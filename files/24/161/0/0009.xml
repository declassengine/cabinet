Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.          It will be remembered that, as the result of the reportof a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet, I was authorised by theCabinet to announce that an Excise Duty would be levied on imported malting barley.   Since then it has been discovered by theBoard of Trade that this course would cause a breach of treaties with several foreign countries.   The Customs have &quot;issued amemorandum on the subject which convinces me that the ExciseDuty proposal is impracticable.   The Customs, at the same time,state that it would be possible to impose a Customs Duty on barleysubject to repayment in all cases where it was not used formalting, but that there would be considerable difficultiesattending this course.          Among agricultural members in the House of Commons theproposal for this Duty is not universally welcome.   On the otherhand the Farmers&apos; Union consider that a pledge has been givenwhich ought to be carried out.    Undoubtedly such a Duty would beof considerable assistance to the arable farms in the eastern counties which have suffered most in the last two years.          I would suggest that  the Sub-Committee that previouslyrecommended this measure should be re-appointed, with the additionof Lord Wolmer to represent the Board of Trade, and should reportto the Cabinet as soon as possible on the best way out of thedifficulty.R.A.S.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.       &apos; 5th July,  1923.
