        Before the War the charging powers of transport undertakings were regulated by means of statutory maximumcharges which were set out in the Act or Order authorising the undertaking or subsequent amending Acts or Orders.  Theincrease of prices brought about by the war made these maximainadequate, and to meet the difficulties which then arose, theMinister of Transport was given temporary powers to modify thepermanent statutory maximum charges after reference to AdvisoryCommittees.       These temporary powers were provided under a variety of Acts as follows       Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of            Charges) Act, 1916.       Ministry of Transport Act, 1919.       Tramways (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920,       Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of             Charges) Act, 1920.       Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of             Charges) Act, 1922.       Canals (Continuance of Charging Powers) Act, 1922,       In addition several of these Acts have been continuedfrom time to time by the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Acts.       Recently permanent legislation has been passed asregards Railways, Electricity and Gas,  In the case of railwaysprovision has been made by the Railways Act, 1921, under whichthe Railway Rates Tribunal was appointed and given powers both,to fix the standard charges and revise them periodically.  Inthe case of electricity, the Minister of Transport has been                    Referred to                   ,G6mmittee of Home Affairs this  DOCUMENT 55 THE PP.0PERTY OF HIS BEPTAffKIC MAJBSTY&apos;S, GOVERMSNT.7.UZ (83).                                                  \ 3  ....---          CBRBQING POWERS 0? TRAKS PORT                         UNDERTAKINGS.         Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Parliamentary Secretary                      to the Ministry of Transport,
empowered by the Electricity (Supply) Act,  1922,  to make ordersrevising maximum prices every three  years.  Gas  has been dealtwith on similar lines in the Gas  Regulation Act,  1920.       In the case of other transport undertakings thetemporary provisions remain.  As  things  stand at  present theywill end as regards Harbours, Docks, Piers  and  Otnala  on 15thFebruary, 1925, and as regards Tramways  on  31st March,  1924.sDirectly they cease, the undertakings  will  automatically returnto their pre-war maximum charges, unless fresh  legislation isenacted.  Owing to the continued  fluctuations in  the value ofmoney, these maxima  may be inadequate,  and consequently thelarger undertakings are beginning to Introduce  private bills oftheir own to obtain higher statutory charging powers.  While thelarger undertakings, more particularly the  larger docks and harbours, are in a position, if necessary,  to bear the expenseof a private bill, there are many smaller undertakings&apos;to whichthis would be a considerable hardship.   Associations representa-tive of the Canal and Tramway Undertakings  have consequentlyapproached the Ministry with a request  that the Governmentshould promote legislation to make the  present  temporaryarrangements permanent.      It may ultimately be considered desirable to introducepermanent legislation, and in that case it  will no doubt haveto be decided whether the necessary powers  should be  given tothe Minister or to a Tribunals      Without wishing to prejudge the question, I would point out that It is not at the moment  clear which coursewould be best.  The Railway Rates Tribunal  Is a new body andthere has not yet been sufficient time  to see how it  will work.Moreover, the duties imposed on it by the Railways Act of settling the standard chargec etc. of the new amalgamated        s Note:- A provision is contained in the  Expiring laws          (&quot;Continuance) Bill of this Session to continue the          Statutory Undertakings  (Temporary Increase of          Charges) Act,1918. so far  as  it relates to Tramways,          until 31st December, 1924o
25th July,. 1923.railways will occupy it fully for the next year or two, andthe Imposition of further duties is undesirable.  On theother hand, it is equally undesirable that at this stage aseparate body should be set up to deal either withcanals alone, or with all transport undertakings other thanrailways.  Apart from any other difficulty; it must not be forgotten that the railway companies are the owners of manycanal and dock undertakings, the profits of which havewithin certain limits to be considered by the railway rates Tribunal.  There are obvious objections to twoTribunals dealing with the same undertakings.       In&apos;these circumstances some extension of thetemporary arrangements seems inevitable, and I suggest thatthey should be continued until the end of 1926c  This can be easily effected by the inclusion of the relevant Acts in the expiring Laws (Continuance) Act, 1924 and again in 1925* Atthe same time I would ask for permission to make an announce-ment of the Government^ intentions so as to relieve the undertakings of the necessity of incurring the expense ofprivate bills.
