The objeot of this Bill is to carry out the recommendationsof ,a Departmental Committee appointed by my predeoossor toconsider the question of the regulation of Street Trading inthe Metropolitan Polico District.      The Committee came to the conclusion that the present state of the law on the subjeot of street trading was inadequate and involved and that while street trading was a legitimate andneoessary trade it gave rise in practioe to nuisances and difficulties which should be removed.      The main proposals in the Bill are -       (1) the registration with a central authority (viz. theCommissioner of Police of the Metropolis) of all street traderssubject to an exemption for certain classes of persons  (e.g.hawkers, pedlars, newsvendors etc)       (s) -the licensing by the local authority of street traderswho have fixed pitches in what are generally known as streetmarkets but are not markets in the  legal sense of the term,,  Atpresent a scramble for the pitches  in  these places often ensueswhich sometimes gives  rise to trouble  but if the local authority are authorised as proposed to allot the pitches by means of licences this difficulty  should be  removed.is document is0 B E  T.   .   -.336(23).
       (3)  a  power to the  Seoretary of State to make  regulations with     respeot  to the  conduct of street trading for the purpose  generally of preventing the obstruction of traffic and Securing the safety of the  public.  The class of regulations contemplated are  those set  out in Appendix I. to the Oommittee&apos;s report        (4)  a  power to the  looal authority to make byelaws subjeot  to confirmation by  the Seoretary of State e.g. as to the removal  of refuse and the hourB of business,       Legislation is widely demanded by all local authorities in the Metropolitan Police  Districts and by representatives of many interests,,  Its provisions will no doubt be the subject          i of varied criticism both by those who may want to widen the scope of the Bill and hamper the business of street trading and by those who will oppose any measure of regulation,&apos;       In view of the recommendations I have received from various quarters a clause has been added to the Bill to enable the larger local authorities in the provinces to adopt the provisions of the Bill subject to suitable modifications. Proposals are continuously appearing in private Bills  of local authorities for the purpose of investing them with powers to control street trading and it would seem desirable that  if it is to be dealt with at all the matter throughout the country should be put on a proper and uniform basis.       I would suggest that the Bill might be introduced in  the House of Lords,                                     W. 0. B.20th July,  19230

REPORT.     To the EIGHT HONOURABLE EDWARD SHORTT, K.C., M.P. [His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department.) jSIR,   We have the honour to present to you our Report on the inquiry youinstructed us to make on April 18th, 1921.   I. We were appointed  to consider the question  of the regulationo! trading by hawkers, costermongers, stallkeepers, and other vendorsin streets and public places  in the Metropolitan Police District, and toadvise as to the desirability of amending the existing provisions on thesubject.   II.-We have held 33 meetings and have heard oral evidence from52 witnesses including representatives of the Police, the commissioners of  Customs and Excise, the Ministry  of Agriculture, the Ministry ofTransport,  the London  County Council, the Metropolitan Boroughs&apos;Standing Joint  Committee,  Borough  Councils  and  other  LocalAuthorities, Carriers, Newspaper Proprietors, Shopkeepers, and StreetTraders. (See Appendix II.)   We are much indebted to those who have attended to give evidence,and have supplied us with returns, maps, and  other  documents whichhave a bearing upon the subject of our inquiry.  In addition to theevidence thus obtained from outside, valuable information in connectionwith the investigation has been furnished by members of the Committee.We have ourselves visited many of the most important Street Marketswithin the Metropolitan Police  District and have endeavoured  to in-vestigate for ourselves the conditions under which street  trading is atpresent carried on.               STATEMENT OF THE LAW.   III. Before stating the nature of the problem with which we havehad to deal, it will be convenient  to give a summary of those enact-ments and decided cases which appear to us to have a bearing on thequestion of street trading.   Section 65 of the Metropolitan Paving Act, 1817 (57 Geo. Ill,c. xxix-Michael Angelo Tayloris Act), provides, inter alia :-   If any person or persons shall set or place or cause or permit to beset or placed by any servant or person employed by him, her, or them orotherwise any stall board, chopping block, show board on hinges or   (D 3/329)                                                A 2
otherwise, baskets, wares, merchandise, casks, or goods  of any kindwhatsoever, in or  upon any part of the carriage or footways in anystreet or public place in any  parochial or other district within thejurisdiction of this Act, and shall not immediately remove all or anysuch matters or things being thereunto required by any  Surveyor or person employed or appointed by the persons having  control of thepavements (now the Borough  Councils) and whether the same shallhave been so  set or placed exposed or put out by himself, herself orthemselves personally or by his, her or their servant or employe andshall not continue and keep the same so removed, or having removedsuch things shall replace them, shall be liable to a fine of 40s.   The penalty is  not for placing such matters and things  in the streetor other place, but for not immediately removing them when requiredto do so by a properly authorised person.  Under the latter part ofthe section the duly authorised representatives of the Borough council have power to  seize matters and things so deposited.  If they areperishable they shall be immediately forfeited and applied to the relief of the poor.   If they are not perishable they shall be  kept until the penalty costs and  expenses are paid,  but may be sold after five daysAny  balance after deducting penalty costs, etc.,  shall be returned tothe owner.  The power to seize is not dependent upon the existenceof a conviction under the section but may be exercised although therhas been no conviction (Brackley v. St. Mary&apos;s, Battersea, 23 Q.B.D486).  The section at the present time is in force throughout the wholeof the Metropolis  (i.e., the London  County Council area), but doesnot apply  to costermongers,  street hawkers  and  itinerant traderscarrying  on their  business within a  radius  of six miles from  CharingCross in  accordance with regulations made by the Commissioner ofPolice.   The Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, Section 6, which is limited in its application to places within a radius of six miles of Charing Cross, provides that no  goods or other articles shall  be allowed  to rest on anyfootway or other part of the street or be otherwise allowed to caufobstruction or inconvenience to the passage of the public for a  longetime than may be absolutely necessary for loading or unloading sue:goods or other articles, and enacts that any persons doing any  act in contravention of this section shall be hable for each offence to a penaltynot exceeding 40s.   The Metropolitan Streets Act Amendment Act, 1867,  enacts thaSection 6 of the Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, shall not apply tocostermongers, street  hawkers, or  itinerant traders so long  as theycarry on their business in accordance with the regulations  from timeto time made by the Commissioner of Police with the approval  of ttSecretary of State.   There is no  statutory definition of Street Market,  Costermonger,Street Hawker or  Itinerant Trader.   In pursuance of the above-stated provision, the following regula-tions were made  by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolisand  approved hy  the Secretary  of State, for  the carrying on  of tinbusiness  of costermongers, street hawkers, and itinerant traders  within
such parts of the Metropolis as are enclosed in a circle of which thecentre is Charing Cross and the radii are six miles in length :     (1) &quot;No barrow, cart, or stall for the sale of articles in the street          shall exceed 9  feet in length  or 3 feet in width, and no          part of any such barrow, cart,  or stall as regards the width          shall project beyond the wheels.&quot;    (2) &quot; No barrow,  cart, or stall shall  be  placed  or  stand in  any          street or public way alongside another, so as to lessen or          obstruct the breadth of such street or public way by more          than the width of one barrow, cart, or stall.&quot;    (3) &quot; No barrow,  cart, or stall shall  be  placed  or  stand in  any          street  or public way within 4 feet (measured along the          length of any such street or public way) of another barrow,          cart, or stall, which space  of 4 feet shall bo  kept so as to          enable passengers to pass and repass between the road and          the footway.&quot;    (4) &quot; All costermongers,  street  hawkers, and itinerant  traders          shall, when requested to do so by any inhabitant, remove          their  barrows,  carts,  and stalls from before the house of          such inhabitant, in order to enable him to load or unload          any vehicle at his door.&quot;    (5) &quot; No barrow, cart, or stall  shall be  placed or stand either          wholly or in part on any street crossing.&quot;    (6) &quot; Costermongers, street  hawkers,  and itinerant traders,  and          their barrows, carts, and stalls are hereby made liable to          be removed from any street or public way in which they          create an obstruction to the traffic, or where they are an          annoyance to the inhabitants.&quot;    The amending Act  of  1867 only applies to costermongers, street hawkers and itinerant traders, and any person who does not fall within one or. other of those categories is liable to be proceeded against for any breach of Section 6 of the Metropolitan Streets Act,  1867, whether lie  does, or  does not comply with the Commissioner^  Regulations. This was decided in the  case of Baker v. Bradley (74 J.P. 341), the facts of which were as follows: A stall  consisted of a two-wheeled barrow, the  legs of which were propped up on stone blocks.  On this one end of  a stall board  rested,  the  other end resting on a pair of trestles apart from the barrow.   This stall was  stationary all  day and was loaded with butcher&apos;s meat in the morning, the whole being removed  at  night.  It was  placed close  to  the  kerb  and complied with the Commissioners Regulations and was managed by an employe of the owner who kept a  coffee  shop in an adjoining street.  It was held on these facts that  the Magistrate was  justified in finding that the owner was not a costermonger, street hawker, or itinerant trader within the Amending Act.    Before passing from these Acts, we ought to draw attention to two cases, Summers v. The Holborn District Board of Works (1893, 1 Q.B. 612), and Keep v. The Vestry of St. Mary&apos;s, Newington (1894, 2 Q.B. 521).  In the first of these cases it was held that the provisions contained m  Section  65 of Michael Angelo Taylor&apos;s Act  had been impliedly    (B 3/329)                          &apos;                       A3
repealed by the Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, and the MetropolitanStreets Act Amendment Act, 1867.  In the  latter case the Court ofAppeal held that Michael Angelo Taylor&apos;s Act was still in force, butthat a costermonger, hawker, or itinerant trader  could only be pro-ceeded against under that Act if the prosecution could show that hewas not  carrying on his business in accordance with the Regulationsissued by the Commissioner of Police under the Metropolitan StreetsAct Amendment Act, 1867.   Regulation  6 provides that costermongers, street   hawkers, anditinerant traders and their barrows, carts, and  stalls are hereby madeliable to be removed from any street  or public way  in which theycreate an obstruction to the traffic or are an annoyance to the inhabi-tants.   Under  this regulation  a costermonger, hawker, or itineranttrader is not within the protection given by the Metropolitan Streets ActAmendment Act, 1867, in any case where he causes an obstruction to the traffic or is an annoyance to the inhabitants.   Under Section 166 of the Public Health Act, 1875, Urban Authoritieshave power to provide a market place and construct other conveniencesfor the purposes of holding markets so long as they do not interfere withany rights,  powers, or privileges enjoyed  within the district by anyperson without his consent.   For this purpose the provisions of the Markets and Fairs ClausesAct,  1847,  with respect to  the  holding of  the market and  theprotection  thereof, and with respect to the stallages, rents, and tollsare incorporated with the Public Health Act.   All  tolls leviable by anUrban Authority have to be approved by the Local Government Board(i.e., the Ministry of Health), and bye-laws maybe made by the UrbanAuthority  for  any of the purposes mentioned in Section 42 of the markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847.   So far as we have  been  able to ascertain, Woolwich  is the onlyMetropolitan Borough which  possesses  markets which were originallyacquired under the terms of this section.   Prior to the passing of the London Government Act, 1899, the Parishof Woolwich, which was an Urban District partly governed by the pro-visions of the  Public Health  Act, 1875, purchased privately ownedCharter Market Rights in the parish, and established a market.   Soon after  the formation  of the present Borough  these MarketRights were extended by the Woolwich Borough Council Act, 1903, tothose parts of  the Borough which were not  included  in the originalparish of  Woolwich, and markets  have now been  established  inPlumstead  and Eltham.   There are also a  number of  Markets which have been establishedwithin the Metropolitan Police District either by Charter  or underPrivate Acts of Parliament, but we have not  considered such marketsas coming within the scope of our inquiry.   Under Sections 50 and 52 of the London County Council (general powers) Act, 1903, a Borough Council has power to purchase or leaseland, not being part of any highway or public place, at or near any road-way or footway in which it has previously been the custom for streettraders to congregate for the purpose of a market, and may  borrowmoney for that purpose.
7313  These sections do not give any power to create new Street Markets,but are intended to make provision for establishing markets on private property in substitution for existing street markets.  Under Regulation 1 (&amp;) of Part I of the Schedule to the Shops EarlyClosing Act, 1981, any person who carries on in any place, not being ashop, any retail trade  or  business (other than one which is speciallyexcepted in the schedule) after 8 o&apos;clock  in the evenings on any dayother than  Saturday, or after nine o&apos;clock in the evening on Saturday,shall be liable to a penalty.  In addition to the Statutes above referred to, there are various acts of Parliament dealing with the question of obstruction on Highways.  The  first of  these is the Highways Act,  1835, which is of general application throughout the country.  Under that Act (Sections 72 and78) it is an offence punishable by a fine of 40s. to wilfully obstruct thepassage of any footway, or in any way to wilfully obstruct the free pass-age of any highway.  Nothing in this Act coiitained shall be construedto abridge,  repeal, alter,  amend, or  interfere with the  powers and provisions of the Metropolitan Paving Act, 1817.  The next Statute in order of date is the Metropolitan  Police Act,1839, which applies throughout the whole of the Metropolitan PoliceArea.. Section  54 of that Act provides :     &quot;Every person who  ... by means of any cart  carriage sledge          truck or barrow or any horse or  other animal shall wilfully          interrupt any  public crossing or  wilfully  cause any  ob-          obstruction in any thoroughfare shall be liable to a penalty          of 40s.&quot;and  by Section  60 (7) :-    &apos;.&apos; Every person who shall expose anything for  sale . .  . upon          or so as to hang  over any carriage way or  footway or on          the  outside of any house  or  shop  or who shall set up or          continue any pole, blind,  awning, line  or any other pro-          objections from  any window, parapet or  other part  of any          house, shop or other building, so  as to cause any annoyance          or obstruction  in any thoroughfare  ...&quot;shall be liable to a similar penalty.  In certain outlying portions of the Metropolitan Police District theprovisions of the Towns Police Clauses Act, 1847, which are very similarto those of the Metropolitan Police Act, 1839, apply.  While dealing with the legal  position of street traders, we thinkit right to  draw attention to  the provisions  of Section 9 of the Metro-politan Streets Act, 1867, in which the prohibition of the  carriageor distribution  of advertisements is not extended to the sale of news-papers.  In  the  provisions  of the City  of London (Street  Traffic)Act, 1909,  vendors of newspapers are totally exempted from the pro-visions of the Regulations dealing with street trading.        PRESENT POSITION OF STREET  TRADING.   IV- During the course of the evidence which has been laid before uswe have examined the witnesses carefully with regard to their opinion
as to the present conditions of street trading, and  it is clear that,although street trading in its present dimensions is of comparativelymodern growth, yet street markets have been in existence in london for many years, some  well-known streets having been used  for thispurpose for at least 80 years.   Many of the older established  marketsappear to have grown up by custom, but a few of more recent standinghave been formed in consequence of a resolution by the Local Authorityfor the district.  Since the War, however, it is agreed that there has been a very marked increase in street trading  owing to the fact that large numbers of  men  demobilised and discharged from  the  fighting forces have been unable, for various reasons, to take up their originalemployment,  and have turned to what they  believe to be  a fairly satisfactory form of living, viz., street trading.   In  this connection we  find  that  several markets have,  since theyear 1918, been established for ex-Service men, and, although in somecases these markets have proved successful, in other  cases they have failed as  purely ex-Service men&apos;s markets, owing, it is alleged, to thefact that many of these  ex-Service men did not understand the methodsof the old established and experienced street trader.   It is our opinion  that,  generally  speaking, the street trader is anindustrious worker,  and that it is only by means of  hard work thathe is able  to obtain a hVelikood.  It  is not the general custom farwholesale dealers, in any class of goods, to give the street trader credit,and  it is, therefore,  necessary  for him to have ready money whendesirous of stocking his stall.   We have received almost unanimous evidence to  the effect that the street  trader  supplies a felt want  to  the public,  and especially tothe inhabitants of poor neighbourhoods.   Some witnesses even go tothe extent of stating that it would be difficult for certain localities in the  Bast-end adequately to be supplied with the necessities of lifewere it not for the street traders  in that  part of London.   The streettrader is readily accessible to the local residents, and the  competition between traders helps to keep the prices of the goods sold to the lowestpossible level.   While dealing with the prices of goods, we would point out that thecostermonger is very frequently in a better position  to take advantageof gluts of fruit, fish, etc., than is the shopkeeper,  owing to the factthat the  street trader can more easily and more frequently visit the wholesale markets.  He is  therefore able to supply  such food at a lower price.   The subject of  unfair competition between street traders and shop-keepers has been raised before us by various witnesses, and  we find it has always been a somewhat vexed question.   We  learn that in manymarket localities the shopkeeper, far from objecting to stalls outsidehis premises and their competition, does, in fact, welcome their presence,We have been given proof  of cases in which shopkeepers have pressed for the removal of stalls from certain thoroughfares,  but, when thenremoval  had become an established fact, the same shopkeepers have asked for their reinstatement on account of the loss of trade whichhad  been occasioned by their removal.  On the other hand, it has
                                                                mbeen pointed  out to  us that the street trader does not pay rates  inrespect of any actual business premises, but in this connection we desireto point out  that, although it  is generally accepted  that  the rent,rates, etc., paid by street traders are less than those  paid  by shop-keepers, yet the fact must not be overlooked that most stallkeepers,either directly or indirectly, pay  some rates in respect of the premiseswhere their stalls, barrows,  and  goods are stored  and also in respectof the houses in which they live.  The question of the storage of goods has also received our careful attention, and, although very little definite evidence has  been forth-coming, such  evidence  as has been given points to the fact  that it isnot the custom to store goods of a perishable nature in living rooms.It is the general  practice in many parts of London for  stallkeepersto store their barrows,  etc., in lock-up sheds and  other similar places where they also store their goods, but cases have been mentioned  inevidence where food such as meat and fish has not been  stored in asuitable or hygienic manner.  Wc have heard evidence to the effect that goods exposed for salefrom stalls in streets are liable  to become covered by dust and filthand so made unfit for consumption.   This was especially pointed outwith regard to confectionery which is often purchased by small children.While strongly of the opinion that all goods intended for human con-sumption should have adequate  protection from dust and contamination-tion when exposed for sale from stalls, we would point out that thesame considerations also apply in the case of shops having open fronts.The question of the deposit and disposal of refuse caused  by streetmarkets is  one which  has also  come before us.  In the days  whenstreet  trading was  confined chiefly to foodstuffs the proportion  ofstalls creating the refuse  was obviously greater than  the proportionat the present day, when a considerable number of stalls now sell such goods  as books, bicycle spare parts, ironware, crockery,  etc., whichcause  very  little, if any,  refuse.  Several Local  Authorities have attempted, usually by arrangement, to  make a charge to  stallkeepersfor the removal of refuse, but  much difficulty has been  experienced in deciding as to the responsibility for the deposit of garbage,  and inmany thoroughfares used as street trading centres no charge whateverto stallholders is made for removal of refuse of any kind.   There are bye-laws  made by  the London County Council  and other authorities operative in the Metropolitan Police  District which pro-hibit the deposit of any form of refuse such as banana skins, etc., in thepublic streets, but it is exceedingly difficult for the Police, or for anyother body, to ascertain who is responsible for offences of this nature incrowded thoroughfares.   AVith regard to the important question of Police supervision, welearn that, during the war, owing to the general depletion of the police force and having regard  to the difficulties undeT  which street traderswere carrying  on, the provisions of  the Commissioner^  regulations as to stalls were not rigidly enforced, but a certain amount of laxity was permitted.  With the  return of more normal conditions the Policehave been attempting to enforce the regulations as before the War, but,
in the interests of all concerned, this is being done gradually and with discretion.  It was alleged during the course of the evidence that in theneighbourhood of street  markets it was common knowledge that aconsiderable number of undesirable persons congregated together for various purposes.  We are, however, of the opinion that this is boundto occur in any densely populated neighbourhood, and cannot properly be attributed to the presence of a street market.   We have examined the traffic aspect of the street trading question,and find that there has been a general tendency within the last 20 years to remove stalls as far as possible from main traffic thoroughfares and toreplace  them in neighbouring side streets.  There are examples, how-ever,  of several important trading centres which are at present situated in main thoroughfares, and evidence has tended to show that, if stallsare permitted in any  main traffic street, the transport both of pas-tengers  and of goods  is  considerably  retarded and  generally incon-venienced.  It should be pointed  out,  however, that many  of themarket  streets are  non-traffic streets, and,  although  not generallyused for vehicles, it is frequently found that difficulty arises when goodshave  to be transported through these streets or have to be loaded orunloaded at shops.   We  have also had  evidence to the effect that in certain marketsin the early morning  it is the custom for large numbers of street tradersto assemble at a spot in the vicinity of the Trading Centre at an earlyhour  which varies from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. according to the localityWhen, therefore, the hour at which it is the custom to take up pitchesarrives,  in many cases a  scramble ensues, and,  although it is usuallyfound that the old-established trader secures the same pitch day afterday, yet the casual  man  coming to the market frequently has greatdifficulty in finding  a suitable position.   It is alleged,  too, that con-siderable noise occurs when  stallholders are assembling or setting up their  stalls, and the consequent  annoyance experienced  by residentscannot be overlooked.   We have learned that in certain parts of London, Costermongers&apos;Unions have been established.  One of the largest is in Stepney and hasa membership of about 900 men and women all resident in the Borough.The Union has arranged for each of its members to pay a certain sumtowards the removal of the refuse from market  streets.  A somewhat similar union exists in Betlmal Green, but membership in this case is not limited to those who live in the Borough.   These two last-named Unions have  made and  enforced  rules toregulate the general conduct of business by their members,  which appear to have given satisfaction to all concerned.   V.-During the course of the inquiry our attention has been drawlto the system which has been in operation in the Metropolitan borough of Camberwell since the  latter part of  1919, whereby street tradershave  been regulated by  the Borough Council.  The  action of the borough Council in this matter is entirely by agreement with the coster-mongers and has no legal status whatever.  In  conjunction with tiePolice of the district, a certain number of streets (which in many case)
 were already used as street markets), have been, from time to time, set aside as suitable for street trading centres,  both from the trading and the traffic point of view.  These streets are divided into a certain number of pitches which are numbered and any costermonger desiring to trade in the Borough is required  to  sign an agreement with the Borough Council.  He is then allotted a pitch in one of these &quot; market&quot; streets, subject to certain conditions which  are printed upon the certi--ficate or &quot; licence &quot; which he is given at the time, it being pointed out to him  that no  legal right is conferred upon  him to  stand in any particular position upon the public highway.   A sum  of 6d.  per week is charged for  each pitch, and when all the pitches have been allotted, no applications for further &quot; licences &quot; are entertained by the Borough Council.   Very little inquiry is made  into the character of the applicant for a pitch, but preference is usually given to men residing in the Borough.   We understand that this system, although without legal sanction, has proved quite satisfactory in working, and  we were  told that the early morning scramble for pitches was in this way eliminated to a great extent.   It appears  too that the amount of  refuse thrown on to the public highway has been considerably less since this system came into force.   A somewhat similar system is at present in force in the Borough of Poplar.  In this case,  however, the  &quot; licensing &quot; is  administered by a Committee  consisting of  shopkeepers, street traders, and Coun- cillors of the  Borough.  Residents only are permitted to have licences, which are granted for a particular pitch in a certain street, the sum of Is. per  week  being charged.   As in Camberwell, it is pointed out to street traders that no pre- scriptive right to any particular  spot on  the highway is to be implied from the grant of such a &quot; licence.&quot;  Sub-letting is prohibited, as inthe ease of Camberwell, and a separate charge is made  for the removalof trade refuse.   VI. We  have also directed  our attention to the question of the itinerant costermonger.  We consider that his trade is in many respectssimilar  to that of the stationary stallholder, and that he, too, meets apublic want.   The itinerant trader is very  useful in places where shops are fewand where conditions preclude the possibility  of the  formation of astreet trading centre.  He is able to wheel his barrow along thorough-fares where there are no facilities for obtaining food or refreshmentand is  able  to supply fruit,  confectionery and similar  articles  at a fairly cheap  price to persons who would otherwise have difficulty inobtaining such things in the neighbourhood.   It is pointed out, however, that, although itinerant traders do notcongregate together  and form street  trading  centres, yet, in manythoroughfares where  they practise their calling, substantial obstruc-tion is very frequently caused, and, although the police  do  all that ispossible, the  barrows are  often a source of danger and  hindrance tothe traffic.
   While dealing with the question of the itinerant trader, we would &apos;point out that in the case of both Camberwell and Poplar (two of theMetropolitan Boroughs where  &quot;licensing&quot; is in  force)  no provision has been made in any way for the regulation of itinerant traders   VII. We have particularly examined the question  of the  coffeestall, and we find that this, also, generally speaking, supplies  a feltwant by catering for those who otherwise would  be unable to obtainrefreshments. The evidence generally has tended to show that thereare rather more coffee stalls at present in the Metropolis than are actually  required, and we also learn that in some cases  two or  three or even more stalls are owned by one man, who  appears to  derive aconsiderable income from them.   Although we realise that coffee stalls supply  necessary refreshmentmostly to bona-fide customers, yet we have had  evidence that in somecases they are the meeting place of undesirable characters who, lateat night, congregate  round  stalls  and cause disturbance and  noisewhich constitute a nuisance to persons living in the vicinity.  It is avery difficult matter for the police to deal with such undesirable personsowing to the fact that they are ostensibly using the  stalls for thepurpose of obtaining refreshment.   Many coffee  stalls have occupied the same site for a considerablenumber of years, and during the hours at which  it is usual for stallsto be open,  we are of the opinion that very little actual  obstruction iscaused, under present traffic conditions, by the vast majority  of stalls,even  though some of them are placed in thoroughfares which areextensively  used for traffic in the daytime.   The evidence shows that the hours  of  opening and closing vary considerably, and are generally made in  accordance with the needs ofthe neighbourhood, in some cases the opening hour being as early as8 to 8.30 p.m. and in others as late as 11 p.m. to 12 midnight. the closing hours, too, vary with the requirements of the neighbourhood,but on the average appear to be roughly about 5 to 6.30 a.m.   In the Borough of Poplar the system of regulation is not appliedto coffee-stall keepers, but in Camberwell  this  class of street  traderis  included in the scheme, and the sum  of  20s.  per month is paid inrespect of each &quot; licence.&quot;   The hours are restricted by  the Council, and no  coffee stall is allowed to open before 8.30 p.m. or to close  later than 6.30 a.m.  Twomonths&apos; notice is promised by the Council before  a coffee-stall  keeperis  called upon to remove his stall, as it was pointed out  by the CoffeeStall  Keepers&apos; Union at the time of the  institution of the regulation,that a considerable sum of money was generally  invested in a  coffeestall.        RECOMMENDATIONS  OP  THE  COMMITTEE.   VIII. (i) In  considering the problem  presented to us  we havebeen  guided by two paramount  considerations..  On the one hand we feel that any alterations in the existing law  which  may be sub-mitted to Parliament ought not  to  be such as  to hamper an  honest
 ,BJ industrious class in the exercise  of  their  calling, or to deprive the general public  of the  opportunity of buying the goods sold by Street Traders, at a price which is in many cases less than they would lave to pay elsewhere.  On the other hand we feel that with the ever- ineieasing volume of London traffic it is essential that some steps should betaken to regulate Street Trading in such a way as to minimise the amount of obstruction which must undoubtedly exist in most streets ifhere a trading centre is to be found, and we also  feel that it is not unreasonable that those who are permitted to use the King&apos;s Highway [or purposes of street trading  should be called upon to contribute something  either towards the upkeep  of the highway, or towards the charges incidental to the Temoval of the refuse,  which is to a greater or less extent bound to accumulate in roads where  there is  a trading centre.   (ii) We have already pointed out (in paragraph III of this Report) that the Highways Act, 1835, and the Police Act, 1839, are in force and can be used for dealing with actual obstruction in the streets throughout the whole of the Metropolitan Police District.   Michael Angelo TayWs Act is an full force in that part of the London County Council Area which is situated outside a radius of six miles from Charing Cross.   Michael Angelo  Taylor&apos;s  Act  and the Metropolitan  Streets Act, 1867, are in force within  a radius of six miles from Charing Cross, but proceedings under these two Statutes  cannot  be taken against coster- mongers,  street hawkers or  itinerant traders  who carry on their calling in accordance  with  regulations issued by the Commissioner of Police.  We are of opinion  that the law with regard to Street Trading should be the same throughout the whole of the Metropolitan Police District,  and  that  these differences  which  exist  between  the law applicable within a radius of six miles from Charing Cross, in the London County Council Area, and  in those parts of  the Metropolitan Police District which are outside the London County Council Area,  should be swept  away.  If our recommendations are approved of, we would suggest that the Law Officers  of  the  Crown should  consider whether Section 65 of Michael Angelo  Taylor&apos;s Act, Section 6 of the Metro- politan Streets Act, 1867, and the Metropolitan Streets Act Amendment Act, 1867,  ought not to  be repealed,  so  far  as  they apply to  street trading within the Metropolitan Police District.   (iii) After careful consideration of the evidence submitted to  us wehave come to the  conclusion that both in the interests of the Street Trader and of the general public all street traders,  other than thosehereinafter specially excepted,  should  be  registered  with some centralauthority.  We consider that  the  most  suitable authority for thispurpose would be the Commissioner of Police.   In  submitting  this  recommendation we have   it in mind thatregistration should be granted quite freely and without undue formalityor delay, but we consider that, in the case of the coffee-stail keeper,special inquiry should be made as to  the suitability of the applicant.We think that the registration should be annual, and that a nominal fee
should be charged not exceeding 5s. (the amount charged for a pedlarcertificate),  in  order  to  reimburse the registration authority for aiexpenses incurred.  &quot;We are further of opinion that the following shouljbe exempted from registration :      (a) Holders of pedlar&apos;s certificates.     (&amp;) Holders of hawker&apos;s licences.     (c) Newsvendors and other traders who carry their wares in tleii           hands  or  on  trays, or in receptacles not exceeding  certain           dimensions  to  be fixed  by  regulations  (approximately           18 inches  by 24 inches).     (d) Relatives of  a registered street trader bond fide assisting hj,           in the conduct of his business.    (iv) We think that a sharp distinction should be drawn between theitinerant vendor of goods and the man who desires to occupy a station-ary position in a recognised Street Trading Centre, and that the latter, jaddition to registering with the Police, should be required to obtain ilicence from the Local Authority to trade at a particular  spot witli]the Borough or other area controlled by the Local Authority.    (v)  We consider that the various Local Authorities should be givastatutory power to say that certain streets or portions of  streets ma;be used or continue to be used as Street Trading Centres, subject to titapproval  of the Commissioner of Police.   In the same way they shouldhave power to  close any Street Trading Centre or, subject  to the sameapproval, to transfer it from one street to another, if for any reason theyshould think it desirable to  do so.  We think it important that existingstreet markets should not be unnecessarily disturbed, but that in [itallocation of streets due regard should be paid to the question of the traffic which may be expected either at the present time or in the future,    (vi) We are of opinion that any person who  desires  to carry oihis or her business at a recognised Street Trading Centre  should lierequired to  obtain a licence  from the Local Authority, and we have cometo the conclusion  that the  Local Authority should be given power toallot, if it thinks fit,  a particular pitch to the holder of a lieehee, \1irealise that licensees might imagine that their licences gave them scutsort of prescriptive right to a portion of the  King&apos;s Highway, and m,therefore, consider it essential that the grant  of such licences staidbe  for  a  strictly limited period, and should be subject to revocatkbefore the expiry of such period on proof of misconduct by the holderor  on other sufficient grounds.  We feel  that  the  system of licensingwhioh we advocate will, generally speaking,  be to the advantage ofthose who without interruption have carried on their business at thesame  spot  for many years, and  should  have the additional reconi-mendation  of obviating any possible scramble for the best pitches wkthe street traders take up their positions.    (vii) We think that the Local Authority should be given statutorypower  to make a  charge in  respect of the licences which they issue.We are very clearly  of opinion that it would not be right to give an;individual  or  body  of individuals power to charge anything in the
  nature of rent for a portion of the King&apos;s Highway, but we see no objee-  (ion to the charge for the licence being of such amount as will recoup  the Local Authority for any reasonable expense which  they are  put  to in connection with the removal of refuse or other matters of adminis-  tration.  The amount charged will necessarily differ in various  local-  ties but so far as we have  been able to form an estimate  from the  evidence we have heard, we think that some sum not  exceeding 5s.  per week should reimburse the majority of Local Authorities.    (viii) We think that it should be an offence, punishable on summary  conviction, for any street trader (other than those who fall within the  exceptions already enumerated)  to carry on his or her business with-  ont having first registered his name and address with the Police.    (ix) We suggest that  a  general Code of Regulations governing  Street Trading should be issued by the Secretary of State for the Home  Department,  and that such code  should apply to the  whole of  the  Metropolitan Police District.  We further suggest that it should be an  offence, punishable on summary conviction, for any person  (whether  registered or unregistered) to commit  a breach of  any of such Regu- lations.  In Appendix  I  to  our Report we  submit a draft  Code of  Regulations of the nature which we have in mind.    (x) We are also  of  opinion that power should be given  to  Local Authorities to  make  Bye-laws  not  inconsistent  with  the   General Regulations for the conduct of business at  Street  Trading  Centres within their areas.   These Bye-laws might deal with such questions as the charge  to  be made for  a licence, the times  during which such trading may,  subject  to  the provisions  of the general  law,  be per- mitted, the removal of refuse, the allocation and arrangement of stalls, the proper storage and sanitary supervision of goods, etc.   (xi)  While,  if our  Recommendations  are carried out,  a  Local Authority will be invested with wide powers for the regulation of street trading within its own area,  there are certain considerations to whioh we think an Authority should give great weight in the selection of the persons to whom it issues licences.   In the course of  om inquiry we  have had a  certain amount of evidence that a practice has grown up  of recent years of  several stalls in different markets being owned  by comparatively well-to-do indi- viduals, the ostensible  proprietor of the  stall being merely  a  corn- mission agent or salaried servant,  in  distinction from what may be termed the &quot; genuine costermonger.&quot;   We consider that, in  granting a licence, Local Authorities  should give a  preference to the genuine street trader, and should pay a due regard to the claims of those who have plied  their calling on the same spot for many years, and of the ex-Service men in particular.  We think that sub-letting should not be allowed, and that as a  general rule no individual should be licensedfor more than one stall or barrow.  (xii)  In conclusion we desire to point out that in  framing our recommendations we  have  endeavoured to put  forward proposals
which, while disturbing  existing practice  as little as  possible, njsimplify  the  administration of the law  as to street trading itt ^Metropolitan Police District, will facilitate the work of the Police, mjbe of benefit not only to the street  trading  community but to thepublic in general.   We desire to place on record our sense of the loss which we have sustained  by the death  of Mr.  J.  Arthur Dawes, M.P., during tiecourse of  the  inquiry.  His alert mind and extensive  knowledge otlocal conditions in various parts of the Metropolis were of the greatestassistance during the hearing  of the evidence,  and would have been of the utmost value to us in drafting our Report.   We also desire, before signing our names to this Report, to expressour strong sense of obligation to our Secretary, Mr. Chamberlain, forthe assistance which he has rendered us throughout our inquiry.                 We have the honour to be, Sir,                    your obedient servants,                         (Signed)   R. F.
