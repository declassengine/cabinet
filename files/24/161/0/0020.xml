(Tigs, jdocumehi  is THE PROPERTY  op HIS BRITAK&amp;IC MAJESTY&apos;S GoyERMniiro.)lbSB C RET.C. P..j20(2il.  (Revise)CABINET.GERMAI REPARATION.Statement to be read in both Houses of Parliament  on                July 12th,  1923.********(As approved at meeting of Cabinet  held at Soon,  on                July 12th, 1923.)         It cannot be made too clear in the interestsalike of the Powers concerned and of any who may hope to profit by exploiting differences between them, thatthe sole ground of possible divergence is as to  themost effective means of reaching the ends which  arevital to all and upon which all are in agreement.These ends are,as they have remained throughout,the payment of reparations and the recovered securityof Europe.    To aovSura thetSi the Allies have grudgednothing in the past nor will they grudge anything in the future.   This responsibility is acknowledgedand is shared in equal measure by Prance, by Italy,by Belgium and by ourselves.   Perhaps it maybe held to devolve in.a.more special measureupon the French and British Sat ions by virtue ofthe great sacrifices -which they made side by side in the yearB of trla , by the intimacy of
                                          HIfact and memory which unites them today and ayt least by the experience which thesetwo anciont civilisations have sharedthroughout the centuries.   A similarcommunity of thought and action binds usin the present emergency to our other allies, whose interests are in no respectdivergent from our own.   In the commondesire for settlement and pacification,and still more for no further or unreasonabledelay, we can speak together frankly andwith the full comprehension of partnersbound by an equal destiny to the same task,  TheWhispers of interested parties cannot beallowed on either side of the Channel or inany part of Europe to deflect ue from thatduty by any reservations, or by carefullyfostered misunderstandings.        In all that we are about to say orto do His Majesty&apos;s Government are moved,as we know the heart of Prance to be moved^and the same applies equally to our otherAlliesf--by tho elngle desire that good--will between the Nations who have enduredtogether shall be maintained and that eachshall obtain what is her due.
     We are as determined as any of our Allies thatGermany shall make reparation for the damages done inthe Great War up to the fullest extent of her capacity,We have never wavered on this point, I do not believethat our people ever will.     Indeed we go further, and we ax*e ready as we have said on many occasions and as was repeated at Paris inJanuary last, to use every measure to compel Germany topay up to the amount of her capacity.     YIq are conscious however ae a business nation that ifwe ask Germany to pay in excess of her capacity we shallnot succeed.   We and our Allies will be the main sufferersand we are firmly convinced that methods which can &quot;only result in the ruin of Germany will be d4aas-tei0.us to thiscountry, to our Allies and to the whole of Europe.     Prom the beginning we have made it clear that in ouropinion the occupation of the Ruhr was not calculated toproduce the maximum amount of reparation payment forthe Allies.   In January we made in Paris an offer whichwe regarded as a very generous settlement in order toavoid what seemed to us to be an economic diaastsr.That offer was rejected by our Allies and since then wehave stood aside animated by a spirit of sincere loyalty to the Alliance which has been and continues to be in ouropinion the main security for European Peace.   Many ofthe consequences which were then anticipated are In courseof fulfilment.   The Allies are obtaining less reparationthan they did before the occupation.   What reparationthey are obt-ai-ning is being exacted at the price of the growing dislocation of the German economic system and asseems probable of the future total collapse of that system Itself./
     The French and Belgian-Government assure us thattheir sole object in occupying the Ruhr is to securethepayment of reparations.   If that be so thedifference between us is one of method rather than of aim, but we are convinced that an indefinite con-continuation of this state of affairs is fraught with grave peril.   Germany herself appears to be movingfast totvards economic chaos,  which may itself besucceeded by social and Industrial ruin.   The localpopulations are in many cases suffering severely,and there are se^i^us^apprehensions of a shortageof food.   Nor is this a situation that concerns.Germany alone.   In proportion as the productivepower of that country is exhausted, so does the recovery of her credit and the payment of her debtsrecede  Into a dimmer distance.   Every country InEurope  is paying the price for this condition ofaffairs.   One country pays it in a steadilyfalling exchange, another In diminished trade, a third  in increasing unemployment.   If we wercalled  upon to state or to defend the case of our own country alone, we could without difficulty demonstrate  serious effect that has already been producedupon British trade.     In spite of very great expenditure by the State(the figure is some  400 millions sterling since theArmistice) we still have unemployment on a large scale  in this country.   Wot only does our devastationcontinue  instead of being repaired, but It continuesIncreasingly as  the moral effects spread among our people.                                             Public...
Public opinion throughout Europe, and not least in Great Britain, is becoming increasingly sensitiveto these conditions and alarmed at their continuance.It is not too much to say that the recovery of theworld is in danger, and that peace, for which so many sacrifices were endured, is at stake.        ;     It is in these circumstances that the necessityfor action has been increasingly impressed upon his Majesty&apos;s Government,   The exchange of friendlyconversations, useful as they are, do not appearto lead in all cases to positive results.   It is becoming evident that the attitude of the principalparties concerned must be more clearly defined.If the situation has been at all correctly/described
described in the.preceding paragraphsit cannot bo loft to ri^ht i,tco.lf. 7 There  will I believe be general agreement to these  proposi-tions - that the period of conflict should assoon as possible bo terminated;   that the indefinite occupation by one country ofthe territory of another in time of peace is aphenomenon,  rare and regrettable in itself towhich an honourable end should as soon a3possible be found;  that the debtor should notmerely be called upon to pay his debts but should be placed in a position where he can do 1so;   that his capacity, where It is in doubt, should be tested and determined, andthat united efforts should be made to accomplishthese ends.?        Peace will not finally be obtained and recovery will not be ensured until a solutionhas been found to three great questions.They are (l) the payment&apos; of reparations,  (2) thesettlement of interallied debts-, and (3)  thesecurity of a pacified Europe.   It is to thesequestions that the attention of the world shouldbe turned.        In the pursu.it of these aims His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment are so far from desiring to deprivePrance and Belgium of their legal claims that they wish to assist them in their realisation/Our desire
m     Our deaire ia for advance, if it can be made andfor finality if it&apos;can be attained.   And in theseaspirations as well as in our view of the generalsituation, we are hopeful of obtaining the concurrence of France aid Belgium, no less than that of Italy.   Indeed,we have every reason to believe that the views.of theItalian Government are in substantial agreement with ourown.     What then are the steps which we think ought to betaken?   The German note of June 7th, in reply to adefinite suggestion which had been addressed, to theGerman Government, proposed an investigation of Germany&apos;capacity to pay by an impartial body/coupled with an engagement to pay the amounts determined in the manner thatmight be proposed.     It further contained the offer of a series ofconcrete guarantees.   We do hot -online that these suggestions, whether they be adequate or not, should be ignored.   We are unable tip agrbe that a correspondenceof this nature upon matters affecting the interests ofall whould be wholly one-sided, or that proposals, whichmay be found to contain in them the germs of a possiblesettlement should be treated with indifference.      We hold that they should be examined and explored inorder that we may discover whether there lies withinthem the possibility of progress.   Understanding thatthe French and Belgian Governments are not disposed totake the initiative in suggesting a reply - although                                             we would. .
we. would gladly have welcomed any such action ontheir part - we have informed those Governments as also the Italian Government, that We are willingto assume the responsibility of preparing a draft reply ourselves,   Adhering however as we do tothe view which we expressed on the last occasionthat united action is better than separate orisolated action, we shall submit the reply withthe least possible delay to our allies, for their consideration and remarks, and we indulge in thehope that we may be able to arrive at an agreementwith them as &apos;to the terms.     What the exact nature of the reply should be itwill be premature to discuss at the present stage.     In formulating these views, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not without hope that they may beexpressing Allied sentiments as well as their own.life do not believe that in principle we are widelyseparated, if at all, from them.   Divergence ofmethod.should not be incapable of resolution,So far as united action is possible, we shall continue to ^roservl it, as we have endeavoured to do all along, and we shall confidently invite.the sympathetic consideration of the whole of curAllies and of all interested States to proposalswhich will have no other aim than the pacification,of Europe and the recovery of an exhausted world.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 12th July, 1923 n
