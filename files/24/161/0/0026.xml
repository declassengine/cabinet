I J                     VJAGES AND CONDITIONS OF RAILt/railwaymen.                    MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  MINISTER OF LABOUR.           In view of the prominence which is being given to tho      question of the wages and conditions of railwayman and the      somewhat alarmist reports aa to the imminence of a crisis, I      think my colleagues should, be advised aa to the present      position.   I accordingly circulate the annexed memorandum      for information.                                    (Intd)  M. B.Ministry of Labour,      18th July, .1983.SECRET,cTpr326 ( 23 )
(I)-  There are two series of discussions In progressregarding wages and conditions of railwayman, one affectingthe traffic men, usually referred to as the &quot;conciliation&quot;grades, and the other the shopmen.               (A)  Traffic Men.(2)  The rates of pay and conditions of service of the traffic grades on the railways are governed by a seriesof agreements dating from March, 1919,  to March, 1920.The agreements of 1919 were concluded between theRailway Executive Committee acting on behalf of theGovernment, and the National Union of Railwayman and the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemenand those of 1920 between the Negotiating Committeeof tho General Managers acting on behalf of the Ministryof Transport and the same two Unions,(3 )  Under the agreements rates of wages were fixed toapply so long as the Cost-of-Living Index Numberremained at 125, those rates to be subject to variationon a sliding scale according to a rise  or fall of theIndex Number.   It was further provided that no manfsrate should be reduced by the operation of the Sliding^Seal, below the standard rate for his grade.   Thesestandard or  stop&quot; rates were fixed at  a levelapproximately 100% over the pre-war rates.    Areduction In the bonus of 2/- per week took effecton 1st July last in accordance with the sliding scale,but this reduction did not affect all the men in the traffic grades as a considerable number of them were                                         CONFIDENTIAL.
already on their &quot;stop&quot; rates.   It is understoodthat only about 30% of the men are now receivingrates in excess of their &quot;stop&quot; rates.(4)     A table is attached showing for the maintraffic grades the rates at the highest level inJanuary, 1921, the present rates and consequentreductions since January, 1921, tho standard or&quot;stop&quot; rates, and the amount of the excess ofthe present rates over the &quot;stop&quot; rates.(5)     Last October the Railway Companiessubmitted to the National Union of Railwaymanand Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen certain proposals having for their object the reduction of the wages bill withoutdisturbing the main principles of the wagesagreements and in particular without at thisstage touching the &quot;stop&quot; rates.    Theseproposals were the subject of discussion betweenthe parties and were rejected by the Unions.A further meeting bQtween the Companies and theUnions took place in December when the Companiesplaced their position before the Unions and submitted their reasons for proposing variations in the national conditions.     It is understoodthat this meeting was adjourned in order toallow the Companies to supply furtherinformation in support of their claims.    Nofurther meeting took place, however, until April,when the Companies suggested that a joint
Committee should be appointed to considerthe proposed variations in the national agreements,   The Unions rejected this furthersuggestion of the Companies on the ground thatno case had been made out for any reductionin wages in view of the prosperous conditionsof the companies,   The Unions contended thatthe reserves of the Companies had increasedenormously compared with the reserves existing in the year previous to the --far and that theCompanies, who would not say that their financial position was bad, had merely statedthat traders wanted lower rates, and had there-fore gone to the railway workers to providethese rates for them;  the Companies had not proved that a reduction in fares and freight charges would result in such a loss of ne trevenue as would weaken their financialposition, having regard inter alia to the economies to be expected as a result of amalgamation.(6)     The Companies did not press their proposals, but they have now submitted modifiedand to some extent extended proposals tothe Unions for their consideration.A conference was held yesterday (17th July)
between the  Hallway Oompanias and the national Union of  pj  Hailwaymen and the Associated Society of locomotive iSnginaersand Firemen.   It is understood that no agreement was reached and that,  in accordance with the existing procedure, thematter will  now go to the Central Wages Board.  The Oompanias&apos;modified proposals do not involve any reduction in.....theStandard rates, but they do raise important issues and arecertain to arouse strong opposition.from the Unions.  they include the  abolition of the present bonus in the cases w^ereit is still  payable and of the cost-of-living sliding scale,a reclassification of onginemen&apos;s duties and abolition ofmileage payments, the abolition of extra pay for night duty andan alteration in the minimum payment for.Sunday duty.  Themost important of these is the abolition of the remaining warbonus and of the sliding scale.  As stated above, it isunderstood that about 30^ of the railwayman are now in rabeiptof rates in excess of their &quot;stop&quot; rates and would thereforebo affected by this.  The amount by which the rates are inexcess of tho  &quot;stop&quot; rates varies from 6d to V/- per vi?eokaccording to the grade, tho average oxcoss being somewhere in.the neighbourhood of 3/- to 4-/- por woolr.   Among tho chiefgrades whoso rates havo not yet come down to tho &quot;stop&quot; rates are goods and  traffic, portors, carters, permanent way gangersand sub-gangers, shod labourers, linomon, wiromen and signalstaff labourers.  It is estimated by tho National Union ofRailwayman that&apos;the saving on tho wages bill on account of thisproposal would amount to over  2,000,000.(7)  Tho other proposals of most importance arc thoso affectinglocomotive drivers and fireman and abolishing extra payment for  -night duty, which is at presant paid for at the rate of  Mmeand a quarter.  It is understood that the proposed reclassificationof the duties  of locomotive drivers and firemen and theabolition of mileage payments, which are at prosont on aha3is of 15 miles s 1 hour where the mileage during anyturn of duty exceeds 120 miles, -would seriously affect the
mor^s earnings.  Regarding Sunday duty, it is not proposed!.  to alter the rate of timo and a half for all tima workedbetween midnight Saturday and midnight Sunday, hut thopresent arrangements regarding minimum payments are to hocancelled ao that payment at tho Sunday rate shall only homado for timo actually worked with a minimum payment as for  &apos;two hours for each tima of signing on dutj?, instead of thopresent minima of four hours for 3 hours&apos; work or loss and  of eight hours if the timo exceeds 3 hours.(8)  It is anticipated that negotiations will proceed forsomo little timo between the parties.   Tho conciliation machinery, sot up in aooordanco with Part IV of thoRailways Act, 1921, consists of a Central,wfages Board,csmposod of 8 representatives of tho Railway Companies and representatives of the thrao Railway Unions, and aNational Wages Board composed of 6 representatives of thoRailway Companies, 6,representatives of the throe unions and 4 representatives of tho users of Railways, with  anIndependent Chairman.   In default of an agreement thoCompanies can refer their claims to tho Central wages board., and, if no agreement is reached by that Board, totho national ./ages Board for decision.(9)  It will therefore be seen that so far as the trafficgrades are concerned there appears to be no cause foralarm at the present time.-   Palling agreement, at theCentral Wages Board the National vfages Board has to operate.Finally the agreements provide that no stoppage of work shall take place until one month after the, matter has been reierredto the National Board.                    (B) Railway Shopmen.(10)  The position with regard to railway shypmen is rather .more acute and is made more difficult by rivalries betweenthe Craft Unions and the National&apos; Union ox Railwayman,,     It is understood that of the 35,000 shopmenemployed by the various railway companies&apos;                          -5-  &apos;
                                                      h 1. uthe Graft Unions, represent about 49%of the men andthe National Union of Railwaymen about 20%,  It isnot known ho./ many of those who are members of theNational Union of Rallwaymen are skilled craftsmen.(11)     During the latter part of 1922, the waradvances to railway shopmen were reduced from 26/6 to16/6 and in December the Railway Companies submittedto the various unions concerned a proposal to reducethe war bonus still further from 16/6 to lo/-, whichis the amount of the war bonus still existing in the outside engineering industry.  Negotiations tookplace in January and February between the parties, butthe Unions intimated their opposition to any further reduction, and little progress was madett  In March, theRailway Companies approached the National Union of railwaymen to ascertain if they were prepared again tonegotiate on the proposed reduction of 6/6 or to go to arbitration on the  claim,  The National Union ofRailwaymsn called a special delegate conference at whichit was decided to instruct the Executive Committee ofthe National Union of Railwayman neither to enter into negotiations with the Companies, nor to go to arbitra-tionj and to call a national strike of all grades ofrailwayrnen if an attempt was made to put the reductionInto operation,(12) .    The Railway Companies subsequently continuednegotiations with the Amalgamated Engineering Union and.the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding trades and in May submitted a modified proposal for an immediate  ...&apos;-/&apos;-&apos;&quot;        &apos; -6-                &apos;
reduction of S/- per week with a further reductionof l/- per week a month later and stabilisation until january, 1924, on the understanding that the Unionsagreed to discuss in December a reduction of a further3/6d.  The Amalgamated ingineering Union decided to reject the offer, but the Federation of engineering and Shipbuilding Trades submitted it to a ballot vote,which resulted in a decisive majority of about 6 to 1against acceptance of the offer.(13).     On 22nd June the Railway Staffs Conferenceon behalf of the Railway Companies reported tho differ-ence to the Ministry of Labour and requested theDepartment to endeavour to arrange for the question tobe referred to arbitration.  Representatives of theNational Union of Railwaymen and of the amalgamated engineering Union, Federation of Engineering and Ship-building Trades and other Unions concerned, have been seen and the suggestion of arbitration has been placed before them,  The National Union of Railwaymen were ofcourse bound by the decision of the delegate conferencereferred to above, but they promised to place the matter before their Annual Meeting which was held last week.This has been done and it is understood that the previous decision of the delegate conference, although notrescinded, has been modified to the extent that thoNational Union of Railwaymen are prepared to submit theclaim of the Companies to the National //ages Board - thatis, that they are prepared to use the same machinery forthe settlement of disputes affecting railway shopmen as,is available for the traffic grades.  The Amalgamated
Engineering Union, Federation of Engineering and shipbuilding Trades and other Unions concernedpromised to consult their executives before coming to any decision but they did not hold out any hopethat arbitration would be accepted. , when replieshave been received from all the Unions it is proposedthat tho Department should meet representatives of theRailway Companies in order to place the views of theUnions before them,(14).     The refusal of the Unions to accept a further reduction in the shopmen1s bonus is not unconnected with the result of the application by the Companies ofAward 728 of 8th. July, 1922, of the Industrial Court,determining the rates of pay and conditions of serviceof railway shopmen.  The Unions complain that, inaddition to reductions suffered by some of the men ina number of districts as a re-salt of the rates fixed by the Award, large numbers of fully skilled&apos;men havebeen downgraded and are receiving 4/- per week lessthan they are entitled to under the Award.  In thesecircumstances, tho Unions contend that it is Impossibleto recommend the men to accept any further reductionin their wages.(15).     The suggestion of tho national Union of railwaymen that t     isting conciliation machinery should be used for the purpose of settling the railwayshopmen1s issue is one which will have to receive thecareful consideration of the Companies and of the draft and other unions concerned.  Ho progress appears to havebeen mado towards setting up such joint machinery fortho shopmen, mainly because of the antagonism between
  the national Union of Railwaymen and the Graft Unions.  For a similar reason there Deems little doubt that the  craft uuiions will not accept the present suggestion of  the National Union of Ra-ilwaymon,  In any case, the  existing machinery would have to bo modified in order to  allow the craft and other u-nions concerned to be repre-  sented on the Central and National Wages Board,  (16).     The above general  review of the railway position  indicates that there appears to be no need for immediate  apprehension with regard to  the traffic grades, but that  a difficult situation may arise in regard to the shopmen&apos;s  case-.  The latter is not unaffected by that of the traffic  gradeg as legitimate reference may be made to the compara-  tively small difference between the rates for unskilled  .  gradep, such aa porters, and those of skilled men in the  shops.  All tho Unions catering for the various grades of  railwaymen are determined to offer strong opposition to  any proposed wage reductions in view of what they consider  to be the prosperous state of the railway companies. It  is their contention that the recent dividends declared by  the Companies, and the amounts shown as reserves, indicate  that there is no justification for any lowering of the  present standard of the wages and conditions of railwaymen.Ministry of Labour,    18th July, 1923.
