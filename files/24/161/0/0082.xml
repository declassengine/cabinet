,/t&quot;&apos;B fif JJ^f^&quot;ment is the  Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government(25) J) * J   Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1923.       -&quot;IJONTIDElmAL.[W 6278/837/98]    I CIRCULATE  to my colleagues  a memorandum which  I propose, if they concur,should  serve as guide to the Lord Privy Seal in discussing with the delegations fromthe dominions  and India to the assembly of the League of Nations the policy to befollowed by the Empire at the assembly in the matter of the amendments to article&apos; 16of the covenant proposed by the Canadian Government.                                                                     C.  OF K.    Foreign Office, August 10, 1923.Memorandum on the Amendments to Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations                      proposed by the Canadian Governmenti    The amendments will be  considered at the assembly  in September, and, as it isdesirable, in a matter of this importance, that there should  be  unanimity,  if possible,between the different units of the British Empire, it is proposed that the policy to beadopted should  be  discussed ih London with the delegates of the  dominions to theassembly before the assembly meets.  The  dominions  and India have agreed to thiscourse.  Kepresentatives  Irom  Ireland, as a  prospective member of the League, wouldlike to take part in the discussion, too.    2. The text of article 10 arid  of  the proposed amendments ate given in Annex 1and Annex 2 respectively.    3. Canada  has  always criticised  article 10 ;  at the meeting of  the assembly in1921 the Canadian  delegates proposed that it should be struck out of the covenanton the ground that it created a definite  obligation  on every member of the League togo to the assistance of any member whose territorial integrity or political independencewere attacked from outside.  The consideration of this Canadian proposal was remitted,together with all other suggestions for the amendment of the covenant, to a committeeon amendments  appointed  by the Council  of the League  and presided over by  the earl of Balfour.   Pending the arrival  of the observations of the Dominion Governmenton their own proposals, the question of the proper interpretation of the article was submitted to the consideration of a committee of  lawyers,  which included the legal adviser of the Foreign Office.   This body expressed the view that the article merely&quot; contains the governing principle to which  all members  of the League subscribe, the&quot; methods of application and the legal  means of enforcement thereof being laid down in&quot; the succeeding articles,  and that the members are not obliged to  take  part in any&quot; military action.&quot;    4. The Committee on Amendments, to which the  Committee of Jurists reported,decided unanimously in favour of retaining article 10,  and proposed, also unanimously^a resolution interpretative thereof  (Annex  3) which, with a modified  first paragraph(Annex 4), was endorsed by a sub-committee of the first committee of the assembly, butnot by the first committee itself, which, in view of the  divergence of opinion about themeaning oF article 10, recommended to the assembly a  postponement of the question to1922.   When 1922 came, Canada withdrew the proposal to cut out the article andsubstituted the present motion for amendment (Annex  2).    5. Article 10 appears to impose a heavy burden on the  stronger States in theLeague for the benefit of the weaker.  The Britisli  Empire is certainly  one of themembers of the League which would feel the burden whilst obtaining the least advantage from article 10, whatever  interpretation be placed upon it. The wider the interpretationthe greater the burden.    6. France stands in a rather different category, as she regards article 10 as a means by which she can impose oil &quot;others part of the burden of repelling any attack to which she may be subject.   It is therefore natural that she, as well  as most, if not all, of thesmaller countries should oppose any amendment which  has the appearance of weakeningthe article.    7. The French Government have expressed their views on the Canadian  proposal ina letter to the Secretary-General, of which a copy is attached (Annex  5).  Their obser-vations,  which are hostile to the amendments, seem  not only sound but  cogent; of the      [10468]
other countries (fifteen so far as we  have heard) which  have expressed their  opinion,the majority are opposed to the amendments as being either objectionable or unnecessary;only Austria and Hungary are in favour of them, the former on the ground that theywould elucidate the  text  of  article  10 and  the latter because under  the Hungarianconstitution the consent of Parliament is necessary  before troops can be sent out of thecountry.  These arguments have no force if, as most people think, the article has not theperemptory force which Canada seems to attribute to it.         &apos;  -     8.  The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government up till now has  been that embodied inthe report of the Balfour  Committee on amendments, viz., to leave article 10 unalteredbecause  of the  difficulty  of obtaining any alteration, but to agree,  by means of aninterpretative resolution, as to the meaning which the article  bears and the obligations which it  imposes.   An  interpretative  resolution  can  presumably be  passed in theassembly by a majority, whereas an alteration of article 10 would  entail an amendment to the covenant, and could not, in virtue of article &quot;2(5 of the covenant, become operativeuntil all the States represented  on  the  Council of the League  had ratified  it.  Theinterpretation to be placed  upon article 10 in the resolution proposed  was, broadly speaking, in accordance with the report of the Committee of Lawyers of  1921.   that report was criticised  by Mr. Doherty, one  of the Canadian representatives at theassembly in 1921 and the author  of the Canadian proposal to eliminate article  10altogether.  The divergence of view thus revealed  appeaxs to have been the main causeof the decision not  to proceed  with  the  proposed interpretative resolution.  At theassembly in 1922 the Canadian representative stated in private conversation that therewas no general body of opinion in Canada in favour of the elimination of article 10.     9. In substance there seems very  little  difference between the Canadian  proposal and the recommendations of the Balfour Committee, and the  most practical  policy would undoubtedly be to press for the adoption  by the assembly of an interpretativeresolution on the lines recommended  by the Balfour Committee, rather than  to  press the amendment proposed by Canada.                                     ANNEX  .1.                             Article 10 of the Covenant.     The members of the League undertake to  respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence  of all membersof the League.   In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger ofsuch aggression, the council shall advise upon  the means by which this obligation shallbe fulfilled.

That the following words should be added at the end  of article 10:  &quot;taking&quot; into account the political and geographical circumstances of each  State.&quot;     2. That the  following paragraph should be  added : &quot; The opinion given by  the&quot; council in such  cases shall  be regarded as a matter  of the highest importance,  and&quot; shall  be  taken into consideration  by all members of the League, which shall  use&quot; their utmost endeavours to  conform to the conclusions of the  council, but no member&quot; shall be under the  obligation to engage in any act of war without the consent of its&quot; Parliament,  legislature or other representative body.&quot;                                  .  ANXEX 3.         Interpretative Resolution proposed by the Committee on Amendments.   .  With a view to indicating more  precisely the scope and intention of article 10 ofthe covenant the assembly adopts the following resolution:          &quot;Article 10  was not  intended to  perpetrate  the territorial  and political     &quot; organisation  as  established and as existing  at the time of the recent Treaties of     &quot;Peace.

Interpretative Resolution proposed by the Committee on Amendments.

                                    ANNEX 4.Amended first paragraph of Mesolutimi proposed by Sub-Committee of First Committee                                 of the Assembly.    &quot;The object of article 10 is not to perpetuate  the territorial distribution  and&quot; political organisation as  they were established or existed at the time of the recent&quot; Treaties of  Peace.  Changes  may be  effected  by  various  legitimate  methods,&quot; including even war, when the  pacific methods provided by the covenant  have  been&quot; exhausted.   The covenant admits this possibility.&quot;                                    ANNEX 5.                      Observations of the French Government.    The  Canadian Government proposes  to  insert certain  words at the  end of thesecond sentence of article 10 and also to add a new paragraph.  The text of article 10would therefore read as follows :              Former Text.  The  members of the  League undertaketo respect and preserve as against external aggression, the  territorial  integrity and existing   political  independence  of  all members of the League.   In case of anysuch aggression or in case of any threat ordanger  of such  aggression,  the  council shall advise upon  the means by which this obligation shall  be fulfilled.               New Text.  The members of the League undertaketo respect and preserve as against external aggression  the territorial integrity  and existing   political  independence  of  all members  of the League.&apos;  In case of anysuch aggression or in case of any threat ordanger  of such  aggression,  the  council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation  shall be fulfilled, taking  intoaccount  the  political  and  geographicalcircumstances of each State.  The opinion  given by the council in suchcases shall be regarded as a  matter of  thehighest importance, and shall be taken intoconsideration by all members of the League,which shall use their utmost endeavours to conform to the conclusions of  the council,but no member  shall be under the obligationto engage in any - act  of war without  theconsent of its Parliament,  legislature orother representative body.    It appears desirable to discuss  the  passage which  it is proposed to insert at theend of the second sentence of the article and the additional paragraph separately.                                        I.    According  to the present wording of article 10, the council has to &quot; advise upon&quot; the means  by which this obligation shall be fulfilled&quot; the obligation being the onereferred to in the first sentence.  The council is perfectly free to prescribe the means\    &quot; The intention of article 10 is to enunciate the principle that hereafter  the&quot; civilised world cannot tolerate  acts of aggression as  a means  of  modifying the&quot; territorial status quo and the political independence of the States.    &quot; To this end the members of the League have pledged  themselves:  first, to&quot; respect the territorial integrity and the existing political independence of all the&quot; States members of  the  League;  and, secondly, to maintain this integrity and&quot; this independence  against  any external aggression,  whether  on  the  part of a&quot; State member or a State not  member  of the League.  With a view to assuring&quot; the fulfilment of this second obligation, the council shall advise upon the means:&quot; it must do so not merely in the  case  of actual aggression, but also in the case of&quot; any danger or threat of such aggression.  The council will perform this function&quot; by addressing to the members such  recommendations as are deemed proper in&quot; regard thereto,  taking  into account  articles 11, 12, 13, 15,  16, 17 and 19 of the&quot; covenant.&quot;
which it thinks, best  adapted to  attain the  required object;  it will  doubtless take-account, in  particular, of the geographical and political  circumstances  of each  state the. recommendations which  it makes will be the more readily accepted in proportion as they are framed  with regard to the  national circumstances  of the  several StatesBut it is desirable that the powers assigned to the council  should not be restricted bythe insertion of any  formula in article 10.  The council must be  free to take accountof all the special circumstances of any State, not only of its political and geographicalcircumstances,  but also of its economic or other circumstances.   The council must even be able, in certain cases, to look beyond the considerations which are peculiar to certainStates,  and to be. guided  by the  higher considerations of  the  interest  of the worldspeace in the recommendations which it makes with a view  to securing respect for, andpreservation of,  the  territorial  integrity  and  political independence  of  the  states members of the League as against any aggression, and  also as against the threat ordanger  of such aggression.                                        II.    The paragraph which it  is proposed to add gives rise to  the following  observa-tions:     (a.) The word &quot; opinion &quot; given in the text does  not correctly interpret the  nature            of  the decision which  has to be taken by the  council in accordance with            the second section of article 10.   The  words  the council shall  advise            &quot; upon the means   .  . .&quot;  mean  that &quot; the council takes  all necessary            &quot;steps ... .&quot; .  Moreover, its  decision  will ordinarily  take the form  of            a  recommendation addressed to the different  States.  Therefore, there  is            no  question of an &quot; opinion &quot; but  of &quot; recommendations&quot;  or of &quot; measures            &quot; advocated.&quot;     (b.) It cannot  be doubted  that  the States, members,  will  give  most serious            consideration  to  these recommendations and will &quot; use  their utmost            &quot; endeavours  to  conform&quot;  to  them.   Such  an  attitude would  be  in            conformity with  the spirit of article 10, the first sentence  of which lays            a  certain  obligation  upon  the  States,  while the second  sentence merely            instructs the council to advise  upon the means by which  this obligation            shall be  fulfilled.  Thus, the first portion  of the paragraph proposed  by the-            Canadian Government merely expresses in a new form the general intention            of this article.     (a.) In the second portion of the additional paragraph, we  read that &quot; no member            &quot; shall be  under the  obligation  to  engage in  any act of war without the            &quot;  consent  of its  Parliament, legislature  or  other  representative  body.&quot;            Although  article 10 of the Covenant imposes  an obligation  on the States,.            members,  to respect and preserve as against external aggression the terri-            torial integrity and political independence of other members, it is obvious            that effect can only  be given to this obligation  in conformity with the            constitutional  rules of the respective  States.   The approval  given  to the            covenant,  and  consequently to article 10, at the time of its ratification by a.            Parliament, legislature or other representative  body could not, it appears,            be considered as implying a permanent  mandate to the Government.  In            case of aggression, or threat or danger of aggression against a State, member,.            to take  measures which would  ordinarily require the authorisation  of the            said  Parliament, legislature or other representative body.   It may, however,            be pointed out that if the machinery for affording  mutual   aid in certain            hypothetical cases of aggression were specially instituted by partial agree-            ments between  certain  States, these partial  agreements  would  become            operative  within the general limits of article 10.     (d.) In conclusion, the French Government is of opinion  that the procedure for            amendments, being protracted,and complicated, should only be resorted  to            to for the purpose of making substantial alterations in the  -covenant;  aid            it  therefore considers  that the Canadian proposals contained in the addi-            tional paragraph, which gives special  expression to general principles, are            not sufficient grounds for setting in motion the machinery for amendments.
