DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT/OTIC MAJESTY.&apos; S GOVERNMENT,.REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NINETEENTH SESSION OF THEGOVERNING BODY OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFIOE.BUDGET OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFICE, 1924.(Earlier Memoranda  -  C.P.  168  (23),  CP.  180 (23),  CP.229 (23), CP.  247  (23),  CP.  257  (25)  and CP.  258 (23).RET   1.   I attach a report of the proceedings of the Nineteenthp.    Session of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office,/23   Geneva at which Mr. Betterton, Parliamentary Secretary to the     Ministry of Labour, represented the British Government.     2.   I would invite attention particularly to paragraph 3     dealing with the Budget for 1924 and to paragraph 10 dealing with     the Hours Convention.  As regards the Budget for 1924, some     observations are set out below.  As regards the Hours Convention     it may be necessary for me to submit a further memorandum to the     Cabinet before the postponed consideration of the matter at the     next meeting of the Governing Body.     3.   Particulars of tho Revised Budget, which amounts to     6,942,296 Swiss francs, are given in paragraph 3 of the attached     report.   The total approved by the Cabinet (CP. 258 (23)) was     6,500,000 plus expenditure to be incurred on account of officers     dismissed or rosignedj  200,000 francs are allowed for this,     making a total of 6,700,000 francs as compared with 6,942,295     the total of the Budget adopted.  Of the difference, viz 5-     242,295 francs, 150,000 francs is provision made against over-     estimate of reduction in salaries due to anticipated fall in     the cost-of-living.  It is confidently anticipated that it will     be possible to eliminate this 150,000 francs and probably to     make a still further reduction in the sum allowed for salaries.CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR./Apart
     Apart from this item of  150,000 francs,  the Budget adoptedwas 92,295 francs in excess of the total previously approved.It must be  borne in mind that the original estimate, for 1924was 9,118,780 francs;  and that the reduction from this largefigure to 6,942,295 francs was secured mainly through mr., Betterton&apos;s action,   supported as he was by representativesof the British employers and of the Dominions.  Had a further reduction been pressed for there was a danger that persistanoewould have antagonised those  who had so far supported theBritish movement for economy.  Accordingly Mr. Bettertoncane to the conclusion that the right course for him was notto press the matter further.   In adopting,this view Mr.Betterton was influenced by the undertaking given by theDirector of the Office (U. Thomas) that, in addition to other administrative reforms, a further sum of 75,000 francs will be saved in 1925 by the retirement of two senior officials.   TheBudget of 6,942,295 francs was accordingly adopted withoutfurther opposition on his part.4.   I concur in the action taken by Mr. Betterton.  I shouldhave regarded it as unfortunate if, for the sake of socomparatively small a sum as  92,000 francs or  3,680, of whichthe share of Great Britain is approximately one-tenth,, thefeeling of the Governing Body and particularly of the other british and Dominion representatives who had so far supportedMr. Bettertcn, had been rendered hostile, with the result thatthe hand of His Majesty&apos;s Government would have been weakenedfor any further aotion which might in the future be considered desirable.

The Director suggested&quot; that a new prooediire sKould be adopted in future under which the  agonda for,  say the June,  1925 Conference  would, be settled by the Governing Body in Ootober 1923 (the questions for inclusion having been raised  not  later than June, 19.23).  Tho draft questionnaires would be issued In &quot;November,  1923 and  on the occasion of tho meeting of  the Governing Body in January,  1924 the employers and workers groups, in accordance with the dosire that thoy had expressed,  could disouBS the drafts and mako suggestions, Implicit agreement was given to this proposal and to a proposal that,  in future,  draft questionnaires should bo sent to deputy members (but not to substitutes)  in addition to regular  members.                 / &apos;  . (d)  Book Cargoes Committee.   In reply to a question by Mr. wolIe7^niFi1IHoFir&apos;&apos;*si;a-ce3 that the propocals regarding the institution of a special committee on.deck cargoes under the control of the International Labour Office were  at. present circulated only for Information,  as the Deok Cargoes Committee was merely a. nib-committee of the Joint Maritime Committee and these proposals should be approved by  the Joint Maritime Committee bofore they wore  formally considered by the  Governing Body.   In these oiroumstanoes the British Government Representative reserved his observations.
3.  Budget for 1924.     The Budget proposed by the Director  was  in  thafollowing form  (1); Materials itoro. fas already paasod by       the Governing Body)     ...           2,274,000 f,(8)  Salaries      .,.       ...(3)  Expenditure . incurred on account      of Officers dismissed or resigned(4)  Unforeseen Expenditure4,418,295  i  250,000  &quot;  350,000  &apos;7,292,295  &quot;     AS a result  of  conversations between the BritishGovernment Representative  and the Director revised proposals were submitted to and  approved unanimouslylay. tho Jinanoe Committee and  the Governing Body,subject only to a reservation by M.&quot;  Jouhaux (workers&apos;representative - iprahoo) to tho  affect that a provisionof only 50,000 francs  iu respect of  unforeseenexpenditure was inadequate on a  Budget oxcoeding6,000,000 francs.    The revised  Budget is as follows(1)  Materials Item (as previously...      adopted)    ..&apos;.&apos;        ...(2)  Salaries (a) Total proposed by                 the Diroctor as                 diminished by esti-                 matod reductions                 due to anticipated             ..&apos;   fall, in the cost                 of living   ...  &apos;     .&apos;             (b) Provision against                 over-estimate of                 reduction duo to -                 anticipated fall                1 in cost of living(3)  Expenditure inourrod on account    ;      of Officov-8 dismissed or resignedSwiss franoi 2,274,000,, 268,295(4)  Unforeseen expenditure total  150,000  200,000 &apos;  50,0006,948,295It will be seen that, provided tho anticipations- &amp;a jj0reductions in salary owing to the- fall in the cost ofliving are realised and- excluding the provision of800/000 francs (non-recurrent expenditure) in raspedof indemnities to officers di3mi.ssed or resigned,
  Budget is now only  a littlo  over 6$ million  francs as  against the  Directors&apos;  original proposal  of  9,118,780 franos.  There  is a further  reduotion in sight on  tho 1925 Budget  owing  to tho approaching  termination of tho  contracts  of two highly paid  officors  (Dr.  yilliam  Martin and  M,  Louis Varlaz).    Tho Director explained that he was  prepared to  aooopt  thesevorely roduoed sum for unforeseen  expenditure  on two  conditions  (1)  That within the  several  chapters of the Budget he      would be  free to  apply the savings under one item to      meet possible shortcomings under other items, (it      was noted that this power of the Director had always      been recognised).  ( )  That  any  savings  offooted on any of the chapters would      be  available to make up  defioits on othor chapters      or  to moet unforeseen expenditure,  and that the      Governing Body would be prepared to undertako to      give the  Director the necessary authority if required.  It was  agroed that,  in oases whero the Dirootor  was  suoodssful in getting offioers to  tender their  resignations, it should be loft to his discretion to  settle  the indemnities to be paid  to them, subject to  the provisions of the staff regulations and subjoot  also  to the understanding that in no case would an offioer  resigning voluntarily receive by way of indemnity  more  than the maximum that would be paid to  an  offioer  who  was dismissed.      The Governing Body expressed  the view that  In  their, opinion the sum of 55,000 franca  to  meet  interest  charges during the construction of the  new building  should more properly be included in tho general  3udget  of the League than in that part  of the Budget which  relates to the International Labour organisation,  in  view  of the faot that  the seorotary General  of  the League was responsible for  making all arrangements in connection with the raising  of  the lean inoludirg the rate  of interest  to bo charged upon it.      The British Governmont  Repreaentativo reserved Great Britain&apos;s oomploto liberty of action with  regard to the pension and Deferred Pay scheme  and the proposals with regard to Salaries Adjustment.  On the latter  question the  Governing Body decided that sinoe the report by the Supervisory Commission with  regard  to  the oost  of living at  Geneva  was to be submitted to the Council  of the league it  was not necessary  to enter apon a detailed  examination of the\proposals  oontained  In  it, but they&apos; did not understand why thd figure of ISf per cent  (tho  extent to which prices should fluctuate before salaries wore revised) had been nroposod by  the Supervisory Commission  as it appeared to tho Governing Body that  10 per cent would be a much simpler figure and  would  produoe practically the  same result.  4*  New Building  for the International Labour Offioe.      The Governing Body authorised  tho Direotor to treat  with M. Spitaux,  .the architect whose plans had teen awarded  the first prize in the oompetitlon,   In one month&apos;s time
 the  arohitoot would present revised plans whioh would tas account  of -the suggestions conveyed to him,   it was understood that the new plans should provide for a buildi to accommodate a  much smaller staff than it had orl^ina&apos; baoa intended to provide for in the new building and0that effect should he given in the revised plans to tho many suggestions for securing economy whioh had been made to t Director  in the course of the meetings of the Building Committoo and the Governing Body.  &apos;      it was agreed that in a month&apos;s time there should&apos;^ meeting of the Building Sub-Gomraittee which would authorii the Director to approve the new drawings&apos;on condition thai they  were satisfied&apos; that the estimated cost together with what  they ocntiMered to bo an adequate margin.did not oxo; the sum available,  i,e.  2,400,000  francs.    At that  stago also  tho  estimates for the foundations would be ready and Sub-Gommittoo  would be authorised  to  approvo the estimate if they were  satisfied with thorn,  and authorise  the  direct to. sign the-  necessary contract.    It  was  agreed  that tho Off ioe should  not  havo a consulting  architect  tut  that  theDiroator  should  deal direot  with M.  Spitaux,  who would present monthly  reports  to bo  circulated  to tho  Building Sub-Committee  on&apos;the expenditure up .to..date,  the progress!the work  and the prespoots.   It  was  hoped  that tho finalworking drawings,,-aooompanied: by the  detailed  estimates,would be  ready for the approval  of the Governing Body nextOctober.  .     In tho course of the discussion with regard to thanew building and as a result of tho suggestion made by certain employers that the financial responsibility for tlnew building was entirely that of the Dlreotor, the Britl;Government Representative found it necessary to&apos;make adeclaration on what seemed to him to bo tho position  wit!regard to the financial and ge-neral responsibility for tinbuilding in aooordanoe with Artioles 294 and 339 of thoPaace Treaty,5.  Meeting of the Mixed - Agricultural committee     It was loft to the Director to settle the date of tWmeeting, whioh should, if possible, bo round about the16th August,  the agenda was altered to read as follows i-  (1)  Eduoation of agricultural workers.  (2)  Workers&apos; co-operation in agriculture.  (3)  :The prevention of anthrax infeotion&apos;among flocka.  (4)  Questions on the agenda of the 5th and 3th Session         of the Conference whioh may more or less directs       ..  concern  agriculture, (adopted by 13 votes to 8).     On&apos;the gueation of the experts to be invited to atttjthe meeting, the British Government Representative propo*that no experts should ho1invited to the-first meeting that it Should bcTleft to the Ocrxiittee to ohooae their&apos;exoerts whan they knew the partiailar subjects on whioJiwould want scientific and technical adVioe.

The agtmda as  proposed by the  Director, viz.      (a)  olaasifloation  of  industries  and  oooupations          for the purpose  of labour  statistics;      (b)  statistics of wages and hours of  labour;      (o)  atatistios of industrial aooidents: was agreed  to after discussion in the  oourso of whioh the British  Government  Representative asked for but did not press  the addition  of thu question  of  statistics of oost  of  living  and  retail prices. ; 1*  Proposal for a  subvention  tothe Technloal and     Soientiflo  Institute of Prosthesis,    ----      In  spite of a  strong appeal by Mr, Oersted and M.  Mahaim,  the  Governing 3ody decided, on the suggestion of  the-Direotor, not to authorise tlw payment of a subsidy to  this  Institute but to leave it to the Direotor to make enquiries  as to the best means of oc-oparatior between the Office  and.the  Institute. 8.  Meeting of  the Advisory Committee on Industrial Hygiene.     It was agreed that this masting should be  held,  the Direotor to consider the possibility of the meeting taking laoe  in October instead of September  as was proposed. Mr. Wolfe arranged informally with Mr. Butler  that Mr. Duokering, the Direotor of the  Government woolDisinfecting station oould attend the meeting with  Dr.Leggeprovided that the British Government paid Jxla expanses). 9.  Bight Hours Convention.     The meeting of the committee (referred to  in paragraph 1 of I,a.184) appointed to present to the governing body suggestions as to the best tteans of  securing the wider ratification of the Eight Hours Convention, mat  in  Paris on Saturday 2nd Juno, 1923 and adopted  the following resolution.The British Government Representative and the two workers&apos; representatives present at tho  meeting abstained from voting.     &quot;Considering that difficulties  have  ooourred with    regard to the application of the  provisions  of the   Washington convention concerning  the Eight Hour  Day  and   48 Hour v?eek, and that these difficulties have impeded    the ratification of the Convention by  certain oountries;     &quot;Considering that one of  the oountries thus affected    is Great  Britain, a country  in whioh hour of work are    in practioally general agreement  with the terms  of the   Convention;
      &quot;paying tribute to the desire expressed.by the jriti    Government to ratify the Convention and after examinat  .  of this Governments, suggestion to remove tb.5 diffiou]    in question by toeans of a revision designed to render    Convention more elastic;      &quot;Considering that, sueh revision might destroy tho    considerable value attaohing to the present Convention    even not ratified, as a model and as a means of stlmu    national legislation;      &quot;Is of opinion.that  before taking up any  position 7,    regard to the question of revision it  is desirable to    request;oountries  which wish to ratify tho  convention    and:are  prevented  from so doing by tbo difficulties    referred to: above,  to  indioato  the definite amendment    required to  enable them to ratify tho  Convention&quot;.The Committee mot  again  in Goneva  on the  13th  June tooohsider a  proposal which  had besn made at  Paris byMr. Poult on to  add the following words  to the  resolution     &quot;and to present  to their parliaments as soon  as     -possible Bills  embodying, tho  terms  of. the Convent!::  .&apos;&apos;   and providing, for its application to  exceptional ,v:  . eases, where, the  application  of the  exceptions provl      for by tha Convention may  require to  bo  defined&quot;.   . At  the Geneva mooting  tho workers&apos; representativesannounoed that they had held  a group  meeting that  morning and had been unable to oome  to a decision.  They asked Mtho whole,question should bo  adjourned until the next mof the Governing Body.  The  workers&apos;  group, not only wistoMr.: Poult on&apos;s addition to be  withdrawn but,  they wishedto oppose the report as a whole as  it Boomed to imply thopossibility of the Convention being  amended.   The  Directcsaid that he was prepared to accept  this proposal provide:that it were clearly understoou. and  oould be made public that no prooedure for the amendment  of the  convention was contemplated by the Governing Body.   The Governing Body  iithese oiroumstanoes deoided  to adjourn consideration of  1question to their next meeting,  14 voting in favour and  9against.10,  pate and plaoo of next  Session,,..
