[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]DRAFT REPLY TO FRENCH  AND  BELGIAN NOTES  OF JULY  30, 1923.    THE most sincere disappointment has been caused to His Majesty&apos;s government by the replies which they have received under date of the 30th July from the Frenchand Belgian Governments to their identic notes of the 20th ultimo.  With those noteswas submitted the draft of a joint Allied answer which His Majesty&apos;s government proposed should be sent to the German memorandum of the 7th June.  The proposalrepresented an earnest effort on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, whilst showingthe utmost regard for the known views of the French and Belgian Governments,to indicate a practical way of arriving as promptly as possible at a final  settlementof the question of German reparations.    His Majesty&apos;s Government had understood that  there were in  the opinion ofthe French  and Belgian Governments two main obstacles standing  in the way ofany fresh  move in seeking such settlement:  (1)  the  necessity of scrupulouslyrespecting the rights of the Reparation Commission under the Treaty of Versaillesas regards the  fixing of the German  debt and  determining the modes of  payment;and (2) the attitude of the  German  Government in encouraging passive  resistance to the Franco-Belgian occupation and exploitation of  the Ruhr.    With both  these questions, accordingly, His Majesty&apos;s Government  proposed,in their suggested reply to  the German memorandum, to deal in a manner  whichthey confidently expected would commend itself  to their - Allies.   How completelythey have been deceived in this expectation is made manifest by the contents  of the notes in which, the French and Belgian Governments have- replied to their proposals.    His Majesty&apos;s Government acknowledge with much  appreciation the  courteoustone  of those  notes.   If  they now  proceed to comment upon them,  they trust that their remarks will be received  in the friendly spirit in which they are offered.    A  reply seems to be all  the more necessary, since, in  the desire  to  avoidcontroversy  at a critical phase, His Majesty&apos;s Government refrained from sendingany rejoinder  to  the observations which the French  and Belgian Governmentscommunicated to them over a month ago in reply to the so-called questionnaire whichI had addressed to the two Governments.   Sooner than embark  upon any controversywith their Allies, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government preferred at  that time to  submit  adefinite plan of action, under which they proposed  that the suggested enquiry into germany&apos;s capacity to pay should  be conducted within the framework of the Treatyof Versailles, and that the German Government should be called upon to withdraw the orders   and  measures  by which  they  have  enjoined  passive  resistance.Furthermore, in order to  comply with the declared objection  of their French and belgian Allies  to any specific bargain being made  on this point with the GermanGovernment, the British  proposals were restricted to  an intimation that if  theGerman Government were to abandon  passive resistance without  delay, not only would this  be  regarded as  an evidence of good  faith, but it would  involve  areconsideration  by the occupying Powers of the conditions of  their occupation anda gradual return to the normal features of industrial life in the Ruhr.    It is difficult to think in what way greater consideration could have been shown to the Franco-Belgian point of view.    The reception, however, that has been accorded to these proposals by the Frenchand Belgian Governments in their respective notes of the 30th July, leaves HisMajesty&apos;s Government, notwithstanding  the terms of  courtesy employed,  under thepainful impression that neither are their suggestions desired by their Allies, nor is their offered co-operation held to  merit  consideration except on condition that nodeparture be made in any one particular from whatever France and Belgium declareto be their overriding views and decisions.    It is true that the Belgian reply appears at first sight to be less uncompromisingthan the French note.   But on closer examination it is seen that the attitude of thetwo Governments is for all practical purposes identical, and that, though the BelgianGovernment appear to be especially anxious for the continuance of friendly conversa-tions, it is only upon condition that the substance of the Belgian claims is conceded in advance.  Accordingly, His Majesty&apos;s Government  ask leave to deal with the tworeplies in a single answer.(Third Revise), August 8, 1923.1678  [10461]B
     The first point that has struck His Majesty&apos;s Government is that in neither is there any allusion whatsoever to the terms of the draft reply to the German memo-randum which His Majesty&apos;s Government had proposed.  The Belgian Government,indeed,  still  remain,  in   favour  of  the  principle   of  a  joint  reply,  butthe  French  Government  pass  the proposal  over  in  complete  silence.   and yet  this  was  the main  object  to which,  in their desire  for  the  continuedmaintenance of Allied unity, His Majesty&apos;s Government  had devoted their efforts.The omission is hardly compensated by a series of argumentative passages, enquiries on points of detail, and offers of further discussions and conversations, holding out a prospect of an indefinitely spun-out controversy, whilst fundamental principles areonly mentioned in order to declare that they do not admit of discussion.     It may perhaps be said that the Belgian reply does not reject, as categorically asdoes the French, the proposal for a fresh investigation of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay,But the consent of the Belgian Government to such an enquiry is made conditional upon obtaining for Belgium  and for France pecuniary advantages of a far-reachingkind, at the expense of their Allies, and notably of Great Britain.  Such a suggestionappears to His Majesty&apos;s Government  to reveal  a curious misconception  of thesituation.     It will not be contested that there can be no sense in demanding from Germanymore than she is capable of paying. What is the maximum she can pay, is a questionof supreme importance to all her creditors.  It is a question of establishing a fact,  onthe ascertainment of which any practical arrangements or combinations for obtainingpayment to the fullest extent possible  must be based.   The  British government accordinly proposed to take steps to ascertain this important fact.  Belgium repliesthat she will not consent unless a money price is paid to herself and to France for the concession.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would not think it right to enter into such abargain in any case.  But the nature of the suggested bargain is even more surprisingthan the proposal.     While the  Belgian note does  not indicate any precise claim, official and semi-official pronouncements by and on behalf of French and Belgian  Ministers have made it clear that the French Government wish to insist  on a minimum payment to them of 26 milliard gold marks over and  above  the amount required to meet their debtsowing to this country and to the United States, and the Belgian Government on aminimum payment of 5 milliard gold marks, for which, or for part of which, she nowasks for further priority.  .   If the estimate made on a 5 per cent, basis  by M. Bokanowski, the Rapporteurof the  French  Budget,  which put the present value of the  annuities under theSchedule  of Payments  at  65 milliard  gold  marks,  may  be  accepted  as  anapproximately correct basis of calculation, the share of France and Belgium as fixed by  the  percentages established under  the Spa Agreement (52 and 8  per cent.respectively) would not exceed 34 milliards for France and 5-2 milliards for Belgium,even if  Germany were&quot; in a position  to pay the total figures of the Schedule.   ButBelgium has  already,  under the agreement  Which entitles her to  priority payments of 2-1 milliard gold francs ( 100 million),  received approximately 1-J milliard goldmarks ( 73 million sterling&apos;), a sum  far exceeding the receipts  of any other Power,Though this  priority was given when the total  sums expected  from Germany wereimmensely  larger  than  anything  that  is now  likely to be  received,  it has notbeen reduced proportionately,  and it has therefore operated  to give Belgium an increasingly disproportionate share of actual receipts up to date.  In addition, she has been entirely relieved of  her war debts to the Allies, amounting to nearly  300million  sterling.     France, on the other hand, when counting on receiving 34  milliard gold marksfrom Germany, would have to balance this amount against her  debt to this country,representing about 12 milliard gold marks, and her debt to the  United States,amounting at  least  to the  equivalent  of 15  milliard gold  marks, or, together,27  milliards, which, being set off against the  34  milliards to.  be obtained  fromGermany, would leave France with a balance of  7 milliards.  When, therefore, it  isnow suggested that she ought to  receive 26 milliards net, her  total debts to GreatBritain and  the United States being  cancelled, it will be seen that the demand is for an amount between three and  four times larger than  would,  on balance, fall to her slhare under the existing agreements.   It is difficult to see on what grounds a failure of Germany to meet her obligations, by which Great Britain is proportionatelydamnified equally  with her Allies, can be  held  to justify a claim by France  to Beplaced, at the expense of her Allies, in a far more favourable position than she wouldhave occupied under the Schedule 6f Payments itself.
    The Belgian proposal to grant a special priority for the restoration of devastatedareas seems to rest on a somewhat artificial distinction as regards damages inflictedby the enemy in the late war.  It is a suggestion not merely that priority should be conceded to material damages over the cost of war  pensions, but that one particulartype of material damage, namely, damage by land, should be selected for priority, tothe exclusion of other forms of material damage. No justification for such a proposalcan be found in the armistice  terms or in the Peace Treaty;  nor is it easy to conceivewhat argument can be adduced to support it.  Sunk ships and cargoes rotting at the bottom of  the sea may not shock the eye like the ruined  villages of France andBelgium.   But they are equally material damage caused by  German aggression, andrepresent equally heavy losses of national wealth.   Great  Britain&apos;s  proportion of reparations would not m fact be  seriously altered as a result of priority conceded tomaterial damages.  Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be in favourof priority even on that basis, if  only for the reason that certain other Allies wouldbe gravely and adversely affected.    In practice the suggested priority would be equivalent to an alteration in favourof France and Belgium of the percentages of division fixed by the Spa Agreement.For it  is clear that  if Belgian and French claims in respect of  their devastatedregions are to be met in full before the claims of the other Allies are considered, andif, at the same time, the total sums recoverable from Germany are diminished, the lossrepresented  by such diminution  must inevitably  fall on  those not  enjoying  the privilege of priority.    His M&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government cannot admit that there is any ground whatever forrevising the Spa percentages.   The principle of a percentage division is not affectedby a change in the total to which  the percentages apply.  His Majesty&apos;s government cannot leave put of account the position of their own country.  Apart from the heavymaterial damages  suffered  by Great Britain, His Majesty&apos;s Government are nowinvolved in heavy payments to meet unemployment,  in respect of  which  they havebeen compelled to spend over  400,000,000/. since the armistice.  They alone, amongthe Allies are paying interest  on debts incurred abroad during the war, representing a  capital  sum  due  to  the  United  States  Government of  1,000,000,000/.  atthe present  rate  of  exchange.  They alone have  been deprived,  in  the Alliedinterest, of  foreign  securities estimated  at from 700,000,0002.   to  800,000,000/.,which  would  otherwise  substantially  assist  in  the  pajmient  of  the   Britishdebt in  America.   Notwithstanding  these   gigantic  burdens,   Great  Britainmade  an  offer at  the  Paris  Conference of January last  to forego her  rights toreimbursement of her damages, and expressed her readiness, by reducing the debtsof the Allies, to treat her share of German reparations as if it were a repayment by her Allies of their debts due to her.  It would be inequitable, and it is impossible, toask the British taxpayer, already much more heavily burdened than his French and belgian allies, to  make further sacrifices by  modifying the  Spa percentages  for thebenefit  of France  and Belgium.   . Whilst the Belgian Government attach to their  consent to an investigation byimpartial experts  of  German.y&apos;si capacity to pay  a  condition which renders  suchconsent valueless, the French Government reject the  plan  altogether,  and  attemptto justify their refusal by posing a series of interrogations  designed to demonstrate futility of the proposal, and calculated to protract indefinitely a discussion on anumber of unimportant details,  on which it is hardly profitable to enter,  so longas the  evident intention is to withhold assent  to  the principle.   Since.,  however,M.  Poincare attaches) importance to  receiving  answers   on  the  several points which he has raised, they may be briefly given.    Astonishment is expressed  that anyone  should  question the  justice  of  theReparation Commission^ decision in fixing the total amount payable by germany at 132 milliards of gold marks  ( 6,600,000,000),  and M.  Poincare  sees  no reason why &quot; an estimate made to-day  by experts,  whoever  they  may be, should  be more&quot;exact  than that   made  in   1921.&quot;    It   is  not   clear  to   what  estimatemade in  1921  reference  is  made.   The  Reparation  Commission^  finding  of132  milliards of gold marks  was  a simple  estimate  of the  amount  of  thedamages  for  which  compensation  was  claimable under the  treaty,  withoutany  regard  to   the  question  of  Germany&apos;s  capacity  to pay  them.   It   istrue that  the Schedule of Payments  subsequently  adopted, while  purporting toprovide for the  payment of  the  full amount of&quot; the damages,  in  fact,  grantedsubstantial concessions by extending the period of payment beyond that laid downin the treaty, and, by waiving the payment of interest for a long period in respect of alarge part of the debt.   These concessions represented, even in the  opinion of the
Rapporteur of the French budget, a virtual reduction by approximately one-half of thesum of 132 milliards, and  the fact that they were approved by  the Allied PrimeMinisters in drafting the schedule of Payments (subsequently accepted by theRepara-tion Commission) effectively answers the contention that the sum, as originally fixed,was not considered too high by anybody.  At the same time, it cannot be said that the&apos;concessions were the  outcome of anything  that  could  be described as  an expertenquiry into Germany&apos;s capacity to pay.     The  French  Government  are quite right  in  declaring that  the duty  of adjusting the Schedule of Payments to that capacity in  accordance with article 234of the treaty is one which still remains to be discharged.     They  say that  during the Peace  Conference the American  expert estimatedGermany&apos;s capacity to pay at 120 milliard gold marks.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave not been able to trace in their records any American expert estimate of 120milliards, though they have found one of 60  milliards and another of 240 milliards.There was also a French estimate of 800 milliards,  and a British estimate of 480milliards.   The truth, of course,  is that at that time  there was no experience  ofattempts to establish and enforce inter-State obligations of such magnitude, to whichexperts could look for  guidance.   It is precisely because such experience has become available during the last five &quot;years that a fresh enquiry is urgently  called for.     The duty of  making  the ultimate decision rests in part on the ReparationCommission, and in part on the Allied Governments, seeing that, if circumstancesnecessitate a cancellation of any part  of  the capital  debt, the specific authority  ofthe several Governments represented on the  Commission is required.  It is  a  dutywhich must, in terms of the treaty, be performed with sole reference to the resources and capacity  of Germany.   The Governments represented on the Commission,  in deciding whether or not to authorise the cancellation  of a part of  the German debt,are in the position of trustees, since the interests affected are not only their own, butalso those of the Governments not represented on the Commission a consideration which His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to think the French Government must haveoverlooked when stating that &quot; France  will never consent to such cancellation except&quot; in the proportion in which her own war debts may be cancelled--&apos;     An enquiry, therefore, by  impartial  experts  into  German capacity,  held  toassist the Reparation  Commission, and (should a cancellation of a part of the debtbe regarded as necessary) the Allied Governments, to carry  out their duties under that article, clearly cannot be held to violate any principle expressed or implied  inthe treaty.     Both the French and the Belgian notes dwell  on the special qualifications of theReparation Commission to carry out itself any necessary enquiries.   This is a claim which cannot  be  sustained  without serious  qualification.   In the absence of an american  representative (as originally contemplated), France and Belgium are  ina position,  with the aid of the casting vote of the French Chairman, to carry any resolution over the heads of the British and Italian representatives, and it is notoriousthat in these circumstances the Commission has become in practice  an instrument  ofFranco-Belgian policy  alone.  The French note alluded to the ample  power of revisionand  modification in respect of general  payments enjoyed by the Commission, but itrefrained from stating on what occasions it has been exercised.  ;.   The French Government ask how it is proposed  that  the  impartial  expertcommission should be constituted.   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the more comprehensive its constitution, the greater will be the value of its findings.  Theywould willingly see upon it nominees, not only of  the  Powers entitled to reparation,but of the United States of America, of Powers which took no part in the late war,and  of Germany herself.   Tf, however, the French Government would prefer anyother form  of constitution, His Majesty&apos;s Government  would, be happy to consider it.     As regards its relation to the Reparation Commission and to the Allied Govern-ments : while for their  own part Flis Majesty&apos;s Government would be entirely willingto enter into an agreement by which the several Governments would bind themselvesin advance to recommend to the Reparation Commission the acceptance of the findings of the body of experts, they would, if the French  and Belgian Governments are notprepared to go so far, be content that the functions of  the experts should be advisoryonly.-                     &quot;                                            : m  m  m     Both the French and Belgian notes challenge the British contention that it is  mthe best interest of the Allies that whatever figure be finally decided upon as repre-senting Germany&apos;s total liabilities, it should be accepted by the German government as just and reasonable. They point to the fact that the  German Government have,in the past, repeatedly failed to act up to their undertakings.
    His  Majesty&apos;s  Government remain of  opinion  that an  undertaking  freelyentered into., because acknowledged to be just and  reasonable,  stands, in practice,on a different footing, and offers  better prospects  of faithful execution, than  an engagement subscribed under  the compulsion  of  an  ultimatum,  and  protested against at the very moment of signature as  beyond the signatory &apos;s capacity to make good.   The  Reparation Commission itself,  as well as the principal Allied Govern-ments, has had, on occasion, to recognise that the German Government was not in aposition to carry out particular obligations which it had been compelled, to undertake.    It will be remembered that the suggestion of an  enquiry by experts, of which thefirst idea originated with the American Secretary  of State, included a voluntaryengagement by the German Government  to accept  and  give effect to  whateverconclusions  the experts  might  arrive at.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government are  not convinced that such an  engagement deserves to be treated as of no value.    The  subject of the  occupation of the Ruhr gives  rise to a number of propositionsin the French note which cannot pass unchallenged.   Whilst His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have indicated their readiness to join in advising  the German Government towithdraw without delay  the ordinances and decrees  which have organised andpromoted passive resistance,  they cannot subscribe to the  thesis that passive resistance must cease  unconditionally  because  it  is contrary to  the  Treaty  ofVersailles.    France  and Belgium hold that the occupation has been effected in virtue  of theauthority conferred by  paragraph 18 of annex II to Part VIII of the Treaty.  The&apos;German Government have consistently contended that  such an operation does not, ona proper interpretation of that  paragraph, fall within the category of &quot;economic&quot; and financial prohibitions and  reprisals and in general such other measures  as the&quot;respective Governments may determine to  be necessary  in the circumstances.&quot;    The  highest  legal authorities in  Great Britain have advised  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the contention of the German Government is well founded, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government have  never concealed their  view  that  the Franco-Belgianaction  in occupying the  Ruhr,  quite  apart from the question of  expediency, wasnot a sanction authorised by the Treaty itself.  But they would be quite willing thatthis or  any other difference respecting the legal interpretation of vital provisions of theTreaty-in so far as they cannot be resolved  by unanimous decision of the ReparationCommission under paragraph 12 of annex  II-whether arising between the AlliedGovernments and the German Government, or between different Allied Governments,should automatically be referred to the International Court of Justice at The Hagueor other suitable arbitration.    Even, however, if for the sake of  argument, the French view on the question of interpretation were  to  be admitted, it is to  be noted that the  obligation imposed bythe Treaty upon Germany in relation to measures taken under paragraph 18 of  annexII is merely &quot;not to regard them as acts of war.&quot;  It  seems, therefore, impossibleto argue  that,  on the French hypothesis, passive resistance to such measures violatesa stipulation  of the Treaty.  Nor is it irrelevant to  call attention to  the rulesembodied in the International Land Warfare Regulations  (annexed to The hague convention  No. 4 of  1907)  which prohibit compulsion upon the inhabitants  ofan occupied territory to take part in operations directed against their own country.These regulations apply only in time of war.  But if  in time  of Avar such action  onthe part of the occupant is prohibited, it cannot, a fortiori, be legitimate in time ofpeace under cover of an occupation which  is merely designed to impose a measureof constraint to ensure due observance of a treaty.  The French  Government have  endeavoured to convict His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof inconsistency in now refusing to acknowledge the legality of the occupation  of the ruhr under  paragraph 18 of annex II, when on  two  former occasions  they joined inthe presentation of ultimata  threatening such occupation,  and when  in 1920 theyactually participated in the occupation of dusseldorf, Duisburg and Ruhrort.  Thereis no inconsistency.  The action then  taken or threatened was never  claimed  to  bein pursuance of the  Reparation Clauses of  the Treaty.  The Allies jointly decidedto threaten Germany with the occupation of further territory just as they-might havethreatened her with  a renewal of war,  for her failure to  perform her Treaty obliga-tiotis, some of which-had no connection whatever with Reparations.    In-the  view of  His Majesty&apos;s Government,  it cannot legitimately be claimed that the measures which the Allies are, under paragraph 18 of annex II, authorisedto  take in certain emergencies, include the military  occupation of territory.   Such    &apos;[10461J                                        &apos;                 c
occupation forms the subject of the special provisions of Part XIV of the Treaty,dealing with Guarantees.   It is the right to occupy the left bank of the Rhine andthe bridge-heads,  which has been given to the Allies  &quot;as  a guarantee  for the&quot;execution  of  the Treaty.&quot;  Moreover,  article  430  particularly stipulates that  ifthe Reparation commission finds that Germany refuses to observe the whole or  partof her obligations under the Treaty with regard to  reparations, the  whole or  partof the  occupied  territories,  which may already have  been  evacuated, &quot;will  be&quot; immediately reoccupied.&quot;  It would have been idle to stipulate expressly for  suchreoccupation in case of default on reparations, if the Allies had already an unlimitedright to occupy any German territory under another clause of the Treaty.    If His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto abstained from formally contestingthe legality of  the Franco-Belgian occupation as an act authorised by the Treaty,they have done so solely in conformity with, the spirit of the declaration, made  byMr.  Bonar  Law at the Paris Conference in  January  last,  that His  Majesty&apos;&quot;sGovernment  desired to avoid causing any needless embarrassment to their Allies.This should not be made a  reproach to them.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would not even now have  taken up this question of legality, had they not been challenged  todo so by M. Poincare&apos;s notes.     The  French  and  Belgian Governments argue  that  if  only Great  britain had  joined in the occupation there would have been no passive resistance and  anabundant flow of reparation payments would have been assured.   Holding the views which they did, both as to the legality and the  practical value of the operation, itwas not possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take part in it. .  But even if  theyhad done so, and even if passive resistance had never been started or were now coming to an end, it is not clear how this would bring the problem of reparations appreciablynearer to  a solution.     The French  Government have now openly  avowed that the  object with whichthey entered the Ruhr was not the prompt or complete payment of reparations, butthe breaking of Germany&apos;s resistance and the creation of the will on her part to  pay.It is the  first  time  that this explanation has  been so candidly given.   But the will to pay is  useless  without  the power,  and Germany&apos;s power to  pay is, in theopinion of His Majesty&apos;s  Government, likely to be rapidly diminished, and in theend extinguished, altogether, by a continuation of the occupation with its strangleholdon the most important centre of  the most productive  and  the most highly anddelicately organised of German industries.     The parallel  which the French Government seek to draw with German actionin 1871 can hardly be sustained.  It is true that Germany refused to quit the Frenchdepartments which she occupied with her forces until the indemnity of 5 milliardshad been paid.  But this occupation was expressly provided  for by the Preliminariesof Peace of 1871.  No similar authority can be cited in the case of the Ruhr, and thereal analogy in the present case is the occupation of the left  bank  of the Rhine,  as provided for by the treaty, and from this no one  has proposed to depart.     Further, it may  be pointed out  that the recovery after the  short campaign  of1870-71 of an indemnity  equivalent to 4 milliards of gold marks (a considerablepercentage of which could be immediately covered in gold, and against which, creditwas  given  for the value of  property  in ceded territories,  involving  no actual expenditure by France beyond internal payments in compensation  for  the interestsof French nationals dispossessed) is not really comparable to the enforcement of athirty-three  fold  claim against  a country financially exhausted by four years  ofstrenuous   warfare   and  blockade.   The  ease  with  which  the  indemnityimposed  in 1871 was  paid  was  largely  the result of  the  credit  facilities which  France  was   able  to  obtain.    Germany  has,   on  the  other hand,suffered  from  a  complete  inability  to  obtain  foreign  credits,  arising  to   alarge extent from the long period which elapsed before her reparation liabilitieswere defined, and the  world-wide uncertainty as to her  ability to discharge them.Yet, in spite of this, she has in fact paid in respect of  reparations and the cost ofthe armies of occupation, more than twice the amount exacted from France in 1871,as well as considerable sums in connection with the clearing  offices and miscellaneoustreaty obligations.     The  French  Government are  in error  in attributing to  His  Majesty&apos;s Government the  suggestion that  simultaneously with  the advice to  be  given  toGermany to abandon passive resistance, the Ruhr must be made to  return to normalconditions of production.  The suggestion made in the British note of the 20th  Julywas that proposals should be made for the restoration of the Ruhr  to that condition which  will enable it to become an.area of fruitful  production, rather than \pne  of
                                    j  7international strife.  His Majesty&apos;s Government confess to a sense of surprise anddisappointment at  the  difficulties  apparently felt by  the  French  and  belgian governments in agreeing to so reasonable and so advantageous a proceeding.    Although, in words of apparently studied vagueness, it is intimated that Franceand Belgium may, when satisfied that passive resistance has ceased, consult together as to how far they  may find it  possible to lighten the burden which the  military occupation  of the Ruhr lays on the  region,&apos; nothing tangible  is suggested, whichwould hold out any hope of the occupation being brought to an end,  even when theavowed object of breaking Germany&apos;s will to resist has been attained.    His  Majesty&apos;s  Government believed  that  they  were  showing  the fullestconsideration for the position of France and Belgium when they suggested that theoccupation  would  naturally terminate from the moment that guarantees or  pledges,less economically harmful, and  more effectively productive, than the occupation ofthe Ruhr,  should  have been not merely  devised  and obtained,  but  seen to  be satisfactorily operating.    Even this suggestion is met by a definite refusal.   Both the French and theBelgian Governments emphatically declare that there can be no question of evacua-tion  except in proportion as  payments  are made by the  German Government.Complete  evacuation  is apparently  not contemplated  until  the  total  german reporation  liability is  integrally discharged.   The reiterated announcements tothis effect,  coupled  with the insistence  on leaving undiminished the total of  132milliards of  German indebtedness  under  the head of  reparations, can  only  be interpreted as an intention to remain in occupation of the Ruhr for a number of years,which, at best, cannot be less than 36 (this being the minimum period over which thedischarge of the debt is spread under the Schedule of Payments) and which,  in viewof the generally admitted  improbability of the complete  execution of the Schedulebeing found practicable under any circumstances,  may be extended indefinitely, ifnot in perpetuity.    Such a  situation,   of  which the political, quite apart from  the economic,consequences could only be described as disastrous, cannot but be viewed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government with the  greatest concern.   It would vividly conjure up thedanger of  international relations being  affected in  a manner threatening -to use the words of the 11th article of the Covenant to disturb international peace and thegood understanding between nations upon  which peace depends.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  cannot conceive how the French and Belgian Governments can everhope to reconcile the opinion of the world to the indefinite maintenance of so perilousa situation.    As it is, the occupation of the Ruhr is already having directly and indirectly a grave effect on the  economic  and industrial outlook, not only in Germany, whosecapacity to pay reparations is rendered more and more precarious, but in the rest ofEurope, if not the world, and not least in this country.    In their note  of the 20th  July His Majesty&apos;s Government further proposed thatin order to  arrive at a comprehensive plan for a general and final financial settlement,inter-Allied discussions should  be opened with as  little delay as possible.  TheBelgian Government reply that they will be glad to  discuss such a plan if it be of thecharacter that they  have predicated in their note.  The French Government, whilstquestioning the propriety and apparently the legality of the suggestion, asks whatexactly  it  means  and  whether it   will  include  the  question  of  inter-allied debts.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  gladly avail themselves of this opportunity toexplain their attitude on this subject.   I have accordingly the honour to enclose aseparate  memorandum  upon it.   The main principle of  the  British  schemeis that Great Britain is ready, subject to the just claims of other parts of  theEmpire, to  limit her demands for payment by the Allies  and by Germany  together to a net sum approximating 14-2 milliards of  gold marks, this sum  representing thepresent value of the recently funded British debt to the United States Government.The concessions which His Majesty&apos;s Government may be able  to offer in respectof inter-Allied debts must accordingly depend largely on the percentage of this sumof 14-2 milliards which they  can  recover  from  Germany.   They can  only  begranted in  a substantive form  when  the general reparation settlement  for whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government are  pressing has been agreed upon, and is such thatHis Majestv&apos;s Government can  regard their share of the German  payments as anasset of real financial value.    To this end the first step must be to fix the maximum sum Avhich the Allies can reasonably hope to recover from Germany, to be followed, or accompanied, by arrange-
merits which, will ensure the effective re-establishment of Germany&apos;s  finances  and credit ,on a sound basis, and will guarantee the punctual payment of the German debtby a system of control free from the economically unsound impediments inherent inthe military occupation of the Ruhr.    In. the  last paragraph  of  their  letter, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government offered todiscuss  sympathetically, the question of  future  security with their Allies.  TheBelgian Government warmly welcome this offer.   They will not, however, have failedto notice the remark  of the French Government that the object has nothing to do with the Ruhr,  and the  consequent further postponement of the discussion to anunnamed date in the  future.  The Belgian Government will recollect from the  dis-cussions of 1922 that  His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to enter into  any arrangement respecting the territorial  security of Belgium apart from a  similar arrangement in regard to France.   Having regard to the now declared indifference ofthe French Government, no useful purpose  can be served by pursuing the matter.     The argument which has been put forward in this note may be summarised as follows :      His Majesty&apos;s  Government have  at  no time contemplated  and  do not now contemplate that Germany  shall be relieved from all reparation payments.   They are  determined that Germany should pay, up to the  maximum of her capacity, the reparation to which Great Britain, equally with the other Allied Powers, is entitled, and which is needed to make good the losses sustained  by  this country in common with her Allies.     What  Germany&apos;s maximum capacity for payment  may be is a matter which should be determined by impartial enquiry into the facts.   It cannot be ascertained by  casting  up the amounts which Germany&apos;s creditors  would  like  to  receive. To  ask  for  more  than  Germany&apos;s  maximum  capacity  cannot assist  in  the actual recovery of reparations.   It can only destroy  the assets which Germany can offer to the Allies.  To force liquidation is not the most profitable way of making recovery from a debtor with resources.     It is  admitted that Germany can only make  substantial payments if, by the restoration of  her public finance and a stabilisation of her currency,  a surplus is made available for reparation on her budget.  Moreover, this surplus must be in a form in which it can be made  available  for  external  payments over the foreign exchanges.   External debts cannot be paid by the  collection of depreciating paper.marks.   In  the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government  forcible interference with the economic life of Germany, even if it be consistent with  the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, cannot assist in  the necessary restoration.  Not  only will it prevent the realisation of  any surplus   for reparation,  but,  by intensifying  the  disorder  of German finance and currency, it will have the gravest reactions on trade.     His Majesty&apos;s government,  therefore, regard as doomed to failure the method pursued by the French and Belgian Governments to  secure reparations.   In spite of wholesale seizures,  the  occupation  of the Ruhr by France and  Belgium has produced,  at great cost, less receipts for the Allies, notably of coal and coke, than were forthcoming in the previous year.  Moreover, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government feel that the  resulting situation involves great and growing  danger  to  the peaceful trade of the world and, in particular, of this country.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government regard a continuance of the present position as fraught with the gravest risks, both economic and political.   They consider the impartial  fixation of Germany&apos;s liability at a figure not inconsistent with her practical power of making payment a matter of great urgency; and they have suggested what appears to them to be an appropriate means to this end.     When  steps  have  then   been   taken   to   ascertain  the  real  value   of the  asset   represented by   German  reparations,  and  to  secure  its  realisation without, further  depreciation,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  will  be  ready  to deal as   generously  as circumstances  permit,  and,  in  the  light  of  their respective   capacity   to  pay,   with  the   debts   due  to  Great   Britain  by her  allies.   They  cannot,  having  regard  to  the   heavy material  losses  of this country,  both  during   and since  the war,  and to the future tax burdens on its trade, admit that other  countries  are  justified in claiming that the agreed percentages of reparation  payments should now be further modified or changed in order of priority.  But  they remain prepared to  ask for no more in respect  of the  very large sums due by their allies than will, together with reparation payments
by Germany, meet the British war debt to the &quot;United States Government.    Theirpolicy in this matter is stated in the British proposal laid by Mr. Bonar Law beforethe Paris Conference in January  last,  and has not changed.   It means  that  GreatBritain would be prepared to waive, in the interest of a complete general  settlement,a very large part of  the amount for which  the British taxpayer holds the dueobligations of Allied Governments.    It is the hope of  His Majesty&apos;s Government that the above explanations willconvince  the French and Belgian  Governments of the reasonableness of the british position,  and  will  win their assent to its  acceptance.   They  are  reluctant  to contemplate  the possibility that  a continued  refusal on the  part of France andBelgium to agree to any departure frorn their  rigidly formulated propositions maycompel His  Majesty&apos;s Government  to take separate action in order to hasten asettlement which cannot be much longer delayed without  the gravest consequences tothe peace of  the world.                          I  have the honour to be,                              with the highest consideration,                                  Your Bxcellency&apos;s obedient Servant,I[10461]D
                                  Enclosure.                       Memorandum on Inter-Allied Debts.    IT is in  the  opinion  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government hopeless to deal satis-factorily with  the  question of inter-Allied debts until  a better estimate is madeof the amounts which  Great  Britain, on  the  one hand, and  her Allies, on theother, are likely in fact to be able to recover from Germany for reparations.    His Majesty&apos;s Government  adhere  to  the policy,  which their predecessorshave  formally announced,  of limiting  Great  Britain&apos;s total claim  against herAllied debtors and Germany together to the amount necessary to cover the Britishdebt to the United States  Government, which, as recently funded, may be takento be represented, on a 5-per-cent. basis, by a sum of 14&apos;2 milliards of gold marks,present value.  This basis  is  already exceedingly favourable to the Allies as theBritish debt to the United States Government  cannot be  redeemed  on suchfavourable terms.    This offer, in  effect, means  that Great Britain (whose material war  damageswere not less than one-third of  those suffered  by France) is content  to forgo herrights  to reparation under all heads, and to  treat her own share of  the Germanpayments as if it were a reimbursement by her Allies of  their debts to her.    Nay, the  total amount for which  she asks from  the  Allies  and Germany-together is, in fact, less than the amount of the Allied debts, being limited to thetotal of the British debt to the United States Government, without regard eitherto loans raised, by Great Britain in the open American market or to  the value ofthe American  securities (estimated at 700,000,0002. to 800,000,OOOZ.) used to finance the Allied cause in America before the entry of the United States into the war,the loss of  which, from the  economic  point of view,  is the equivalent of the contracting of an equal amount of foreign  debt.    Of the sum of  14&apos;2 milliards  gold marks, Great Britain is anxious to recover  as large a percentage as possible  from Germany, in order to be able  to offer themaximum concessions feasible  in  regard to  inter-Allied debts.  But it  is notpossible for her to  grant  such  concessions in a substantive form unless and until such a reparation settlement has been  arrived  at as will enable her to regard hershare of the German payments as an asset of real financial value.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment greatly fear that a persistence in the policy indicated, in the French note will make the prospects of such a settlement remote.    The only  practical manner in which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment, the question of inter-Allied debts can now be approached, is for the allies to agree in the first instance upon the  maximum sum which they can reasonablyhope to recover from Germany.   When such an agreement has been arrived at, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be prepared (provided that the settlement is such as tomake the German obligation a reasonably good asset) to write down, with due regardto the different circumstances  of the respective debtors,  the Allied debts owing  tothem, to an amount representing the difference between the British share of the revised German obligation and the British debt of 14-2 milliards to the United StatesGovernment, and  even to   consider accepting payment of the Allied debts  soreduced in the form of the new German obligations on  the principles laid downin the plan presented by Mr, Bonar Law at the Paris Conference in January last.    They cannot,  however, conceal from  the  French Government  the fact thatthis latter  suggestion is less attractive  to them  than it  was then, since the deterioration in the financial  prospects of Germany, resulting, as they hold, fromthe unwise policy pursued   by the French and Belgian  Governments, has madethe security represented by German reparation bonds much more precarious (evenif the total obligations should be reduced below the figure contemplated  by HisMajesty&apos;s Government seven months ago).    His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound to observe in  this connection that the willingness which  they and their predecessors have shown to discuss with theFrench Government arrangements under which the burden of the French debt toGreat Britain might  be mitigated must hot be interpreted as a waiver on their part of  their rights as creditors,  which are governed solely by the contracts underwhich the money was advanced and the securities which they hold.    That a  French Government Treasury bill given to the British Governmentfor value received is a less binding obligation than a similar bill given to a private
                                     ii                                   62investor is a doctrine inadmissible both in  itself and  more especially in view ofthe circumstances in which these particular loans were contracted.    The normal course would have been for the French  Government to  appealdirectly to the British  investor for the  accommodation  it  required, and  that procedure  was in fact adopted for a short period at the  commencement  of thewar.  It soon became apparent, however, that  the French Government would be unable to raise on its own credit amounts  sufficient to  meet its  sterling require-ments, and the British  Government stepped  in and gave its own securities  to the lender for the amounts raised to  cover French requirements as well as British.By this means  the French Government  were able to borrow  indirectly fromBritish lenders both on  less onerous terms and  to  a  larger amount than wouldhave been  possible if the normal procedure had  been  followed.   The  payments due on the  French Treasury  bills thus represent  amounts which the  british treasury is in fact paying to  the holders of securities issued on behalf of  theFrench Treasury of which the French Treasury received the proceeds.    There was no suggestion when the loans were made that the  repaymentshould be  dependent on  recoveries from Germany.   Indeed, during  the  greaterpart of the period covered by the advances,  the prospects  of any such recoverieswere highly problematical.  The bills were made subject to renewal for a limited period only after the end of the war, with the clear intension that as soon asFrench credit was  sufficiently re-established they  should be redeemed  out  ofFrench Government loans to be raised on the London market,  the redemptionmoney being applied to the cancellation of the British securities issued on Frenchaccount.    While  His  Majesty&apos;s Government have, by continuing to  renew the billsbeyond the period  of the contract, tacitly recognised that  the time has not yet arrived for giving  effect to this intention, it must be clearly understood that, inthe absence of a new agreement, the carrying out of  it  remains an obligation  ofthe French Government which cannot honourably be repudiated,  and that,  in themeantime, the present practice of adding interest to capital cannot be indefinitelycontinued, and that a commencement of payment of at any  rate  a part of theinterest should be made as soon as the sterling-franc exchange becomes reasonablystable.
