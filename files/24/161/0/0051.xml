Moody, Colonial OfficeAdded at a later date.
SECRET.CABINET.PALESTINE  COMMITTEE.THE FUTURE OF PALESTINE.REPORT.     THE Committee of the Cabinet, who were appointed to examine and advise upon the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.in  relation to Palestine, have held several sittings, and now present the following Report :-     We have had the advantage of hearing a full exposition of the present situation in Palestine  from the High Commissioner,  Sir H. Samuel, who answered  all our questions with great  readiness.   We have not taken any  other outside evidence, mainly from the difficulty of discriminating between the witnesses who might desire to be heard, still more because the time at our disposal before the end of the Session has been short and because we felt that  the. most urgent need is a prompt and final decision by His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government, whatever be the form that it assumes.     It is not necessary to analyse here the contents  of the various papers which have been submitted to and studied by the Committee.   Many of them raise issues upon which wide differences of opinion have  at different times been held,  but which are in a sense obsolete, because no one now seriously advocates a complete reversal of policy on their account.  Of such a nature are the promises or pledges, not  always clear or consistent, which have been  made to the Arabs  and about which a wordy warfare can easily be waged.  This question may be said to have been finally disposed of in the White Paper of last summer, and unless  it is proposed to tear up  in toto that declaration of Government policy, it is unnecessary to revive it.  Broadly speaking, we  can  claim with justice to be innocent  of  any conscious breach of faith either to the Arabs or to anyone else.     Similarly,  it  is  no longer  pertinent to  discuss the policy of the original Declaration of 1917. &apos; There are some of  our number who think that that Declaration was both unnecessary  and unwise, and who hold that our subsequent troubles  have sprung in the main from its adoption.  But that  was nearly six years  ago.  We cannot ignore the fact that ever since it has been the accepted policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, that it was also accepted, not indeed  without some reluctance,  by the whole of our Allies, that it met with especial favour in  America, that it was officially endorsed at San Remo, fhat it figured in the original  Treaty of Sevres, and that itwas textually reproduced in  the Mandate  for Palestine,  which wag officially submittedto  and approved by the Council  of the League of Nations in July 1922.  Further,it has been the basis upon which Zionist co-operation in the development of Palestinehas been freely given and upon which very large sums of Jewish money have since been subscribed.    Whether  this policy has been wise or unwise,  the above considerations,  whichcannot be disputed, possess a cumulative weight from which it is well-nigh impossiblefor any Government&apos;to  extricate itself without a substantial sacrifice  of consistencyarid self-respect, if not of honour.  Those of us who have disliked the  policy are notprepared to make that  sacrifice.  Those  of us who  approved the policy throughoutwould, of course, speak in much less equivocal terms.      [10390]
     Nevertheless, the alternative  of a  complete reversal  of  the policy  hithertopursued is one that, whatever the price that might have to be paid for it, we have no!dogmatically refused to consider.  The reasons, apart from those which have alreadvbeen indicated, which lead us to advise against such a course  are these :      1.  We see no way of reversing the policy without throwing up the Mandate.     2.  If  we return the Mandate another claimant would very quickly be  forth.         . coming.  Whether that claimant were France  or Italy, the  result  would           be equally injurious to British and, as we think, to Palestinian, interests     3.  If  no applicant  were forthcoming and the Palestinian  Arabs were left ts           work out their own destiny, the sequel could hardly fail to be the return           at no distant period, of the Turks.  This would be an even more disastrous           consequence, and would, indeed, involve the final sacrifice of  all for which           we fought and won the Eastern war.     4.  Although the strategical value of Palestine is rated by the Imperial General           Staff less highly than it had been placed by some authorities, yet none of           us can contemplate with equanimity  the  installation in  Palestine of           another Power.     These considerations led us to a careful scrutiny of the position as it now stands,Great harm has, no  doubt, been done by the exaggerated pretensions of the Zionistorganisations and press at an earlier  stage, and, if  the Arabs have been badly;frightened, it has been largely in consequence of these mistaken tactics.  During the&apos;past year,  however, the Zionist  leaders have greatly modified both their claims andtheir language,  and their acceptance  of the policy laid down by the late Governmentin the White Paper of June 1922 has, we believe, been sincere and ungrudging. Onthe other hand, the continuance of the agitation here,  and perhaps also the change;of Government  in England, have led the  Arabs to  think that a complete reversal ofpolicy is  still  possible,  and that by  refusing all compromise, perhaps  even byorganising some form of  passive resistance, they may induce Plis Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, if not to abandon the Mandate, at least to give to Palestine a full measure ofself-government  which they could utilise to obtain a complete ascendancy over the;numerically small minority of Jews. It would appear to be from this standpointthat the Arabs  have  boycotted the recent elections for  the Legislative  Council, andmay even,  as some anticipate, have  recourse  to  more  extreme measures.  The con-elusion  that we  deduce from these considerations is not that an agitation so inspiredand  conducted should be yielded to, but that an early and firm decision is necessaryin order to prevent it from attaining a further and more dangerous momentum.     If this object is to be secured, the decision so  arrived at should aim  at meetingthosie of the Arab grievances or complaints in which there is substance, without, atthe same  time,  breaking&quot; faith with  those to whom we are deeply and honourablypledged.  Our search for this avenue of extrication has been materially assisted bythe complainants themselves. If  we study their  petitions and speeches  we find.that it is not so much the existence of  the Mandate, or the Balfour Declaration, or the recognition of a Jewish National Home (in its later and narrower interpretation) towhich they object, as it  is the preferential position which has been accorded to the zionists in the country,  and the universal Arab belief that  the  scales  are weightedagainst the Arabs in the Administration.   The appointment of a Jewish HighCommissioner, however able and impartial (and Sir H. Samuel  has been both in noordinary degree); the existence of  a  Jewish Agency in Palestine with special access to the High Commissioner; the not inconsiderable  (although restricted) immigrationof many thousands of Jews since the war;  the encouragement,  however expedientand  cautious, of Jewish enterprise, e.g., the Rutenberg Concession, have all fosteredthis  belief  that the Jews are being unduly favoured and that the Arabs are beingpushed  into a background where the  spoils of Palestine will  be for others, and neverfor them.     The question to  be  answered,,then is this : Is there any real ground for thissuspicion,  and,  if so, can it be  relieved?     At this stage our  attention was turned to the exact words of the Mandate,Article  4 of which runs a.s follows :          &quot; An appropriate Jewish agency shall be recognised as a public body for     &quot; the  purpose of  advising,  and  co-operating with the  Administration of     &quot; Palestine in such economic, social and other matters as may affect  the establish-     &quot; ment of the Jewish National Home and the interests of the Jewish population     &quot; in Palestine,  and, subject  always to the control  of  the  Administration, to     &quot; assist and take part in the development of the country.
        &quot; The Zionist organisation, so long  as its  organisation and constitution    &quot; are, in the opinion of the Mandatory, appropriate, shall be recognised.as such    &quot;agency.   It shall take  steps, in consultation with His Britannic Majesty&apos;s    &quot; Government, to secure the, co-operation *-of all Jews  who are willing  to assist    &quot; in the establishment of the Jewish  National Home.&quot;    A little later comes Article 6, which  runs thus :  ;        &quot;The Administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights  and    &quot;position of other sections of the  population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate    &quot;Jewish  immigration  under  suitable  conditions  and  shall  encourage, in    &quot;co-operation with the Jewish agency referred to in Article 4, close settlement    &quot; by Jews on the land,  including State lands and waste lands not required for    &quot;public purposes.&quot;    Now it is true that Article 6 lays down that  &apos;&apos; the rights and position  of other&quot;sections of the population shall not  be  prejudiced&quot; (in respect of immigration).But this gives no consolation to those who believe that  an extended Zionist  influxcannot fail to  cause such prejudice.   Nor is  the  impression produced  by Article 4diminished;  it is, on the contrary, aggravated by the terms of Article 2, which runsas follows:         &quot;The Mandatory shall be responsible  for placing the country, under such    &quot;political, administrative and economic conditions as will secure.the establish-    &quot;ment of the Jewish National Home as laid, down&apos;in the. preamble,  and the    &quot; development of self-governing institutions, and  also for safeguarding the civil    &quot;and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of  race    &quot;and religion.&quot;    It is difficult to blame those who argue that the two parts of  this Article are inconsistent  with each other, and, indeed, that the entire Mandate is built on thefallacy of attempting to reconcile the irreconcilable, and to  combine in the  sameframework the creation of Jewish privileges with the maintenance of Arab  rights.    It would appear then that it is to  the terms of the Mandate that we should look for a solution of the difficulty, and that if we can redress the alleged preference tothe Jews, by offering similar or analogous advantages to the  Arabs,  we may succeed in removing the sting.   We  accordingly proceeded to consider whether, and, if so,how, this could be done.    It may be  urged, with, justice, that the Mandatory Power had its own  plan fordealing with the  grievance  said  to have been  thus created, viz.,  by means of theLegislative Council upon which elected  representatives of  the Arabs were to sit.That is quite true.  But the Legislative Council has broken down for the time being,through the refusal of the Arabs to take part in the elections;  and although Sir H.Samuel hopes to be able to induce some representative Arabs to serve on  the AdvisoryCouncil which  he is reconstituting as an interim measure,  the fact remains that theBritish policy  has for the time being failed and that some other remedy  must besought.    We accordingly advise  that as regards the Administration, an Arab Agencyshall be set up which will occupy a position exactly analogous to that accorded to theJewish Agency under the terms of the  Mandate, is., it will be recognised as a publicbody for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration in sucheconomic, social  and other matters as may affect the interests  of  the non-Jewishpopulation, and,  subject to the control of the Administration, may assist and. take part in the development of  the country.    Secondly as regards immigration (Article 6) it will have the right to be consulted as to the means of &quot;ensuring that the  rights and position of other (is., non-Jewish)&quot;sections of the  population are not prejudiced.&quot;    With regard to public works it will be entitled to be consulted, by the Administra-1 ion in the same way  as the Jewish Agency  is to be  consulted under  the  terms ofArticle 11.    Further, Article 84 of the Palestine Order in  Council of 1922 provides  that         &quot; (i.)  The High Commissioner shall confer upon all matters relating to the    &quot; regulation of immigration with a Committee consisting  of not less than one-half    &quot; of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council, and provision shall be made    &quot;by  Order in Council for investing  the said Committee with  all such powers      [10390]                                                          c
     &quot;and authorities and otherwise for the constitution and conduct of the business     &quot;of the said Committee, as may be necessary to carry this Article into effect.         &quot;(ft) In the event of any difference of opinion between the High Commit-     &quot;sioner and the said Committee upon any such matter as  aforesaid,  the Hjp-fi     &quot;Commissioner shall make a full report on the subject to the Secretary of State.     &quot; whose decision thereon shall be final.&quot;     With the breakdown of the Legislative Council, the  proposed Committee has never come into existence. It is proposed that the Arab Agency now m contemplation-should take its place for the purposes of the functions indicated m Article 84.     As regards the composition of the Arab Agency, it is proposed that it  should  lieleft to the High Commissioner to nominate suitable persons, it being of course under-stood thai, representatives of all sections of the Arab community will be included.     Sir Herbert Samuel is of opinion that this proposal may be accepted, not indeedoy the Arab extremists, who want representative Government and Arab&apos;ascendancyat a  bound, but by an appreciable section of Arab  opinion,  to whom indeed it wouldnot only be a great concession, but would mean the removal of one of the grievancesjn which  they have laid most emphasis.     It goes without saying that the consent of -the Zionists would also have to  beprocured.  We must do nothing that could be interpreted by  them as a breach of faith.and  we do not want to staunch the flow of the subscriptions from the Jewish world,which are still essential for the material prosperity, perhaps even for the continued existence,  of  their colonies in Palestine, and secondarily for  the future developmentof Palestine  as a  whole. When,  however, we recall the terms  of their pledge  as recorded in the White Paper in the concluding paragraph of Dr. Weizmann&apos;s &quot;letterof the 18th June, 1922, and when they realise that the alternative may be the jeopardy,if not the loss, of the National Home itself, it cannot, I think, be doubted that counselsof wisdom will prevail.     We feel, however, very strongly that if this great concession to Arab sentimentbe made, it should only be made as part of an  agreed settlement with them, that itmust be accepted by  their representative  organisations and by  their leaders as afinal  settlement,  and that an  end must  be&quot; placed to the  agitation, whether  inPalestine  or outside, which has been the fruitful source of so much trouble, expense.and  even bloodshed.  The arrangement is  one that must be loyally implemented byall parties otherwise we shall  have conceded much for no adequate return.     We further discussed the question whether it would be  desirable to invest this settlement, supposing it to be  made,  with the  sanction of a wider authority than our own, and to endeavour to secure for it the approval of the  League of Nations.We think that there is a great deal  to be said for this course, and that, whetherthrough the medium of a Report to the Council of  the League. in response to the questionnaire which has already under the existing Regulations been addressed bythe League to the Mandatory Power or by more  direct action, the sanction of theLeague  should be procured.  It might even be desirable to apply  formally for the incorporation of the new Articles in the body of the Mandate  itself.   This, of course,could only be done with the consent of all the Powers represented on the Council,&apos;which it would be a little invidious for them to refuse.  But such  a plan must alsobe conditional upon the  absolute and unequivocal  acceptance of  the compromise  bythe parties principally concerned, i.e.. the Palestinian Jews and the Arabs themselves.     While this is the concrete suggestion that we  submit to  the Cabinet, Ave shouldnot like the latter to think that we have not considered whether it would be possible,as in the case of Iraq, to place a limit of time to our commitments and our expendi-ture  in Palestine.  The circumstances, however,  differ in toto.  In Iraq we are dealingwith an Arab  State  and an  Arab Government,  which has already  an organisedexistence,  and the entry of which into the League of Nations we contemplate in afew years&apos; time.  There is no parallel to this in Palestine, where the Arabs in presentcircumstances can scarcely be regarded as capable either of  forming a Government orconstituting a State.  In Iraq we are under no commitments to a particular class ofthe population as we are to the Zionists in Palestine.  In Iraq we are not present,as we are in the Holy Land, as the trustees, so to speak, of  civilisation, into whosehands has been committed  by the world a sacred trust  that  it would be almostshameful  to abandon.  There is, indeed, no analogy between the  two situations.     Sir H.  Samuel, in his recorded evidence,  placed before us his estimate of thefuture of Palestine, both as regards the  military responsibilities and the financial obligations which it will entail, and also as regards the economic development of thecountry.&apos;  These estimates may turn out to be unduly sanguine; already they have to
some extent been checked by the less rosy forecast of Sir G. Clayton.  We feel thatthe  only way  in which these doubts  can be resolved is by securing stability  andcreating confidence, and that the best hope for the relief of the British taxpayer lies in improving the  economic conditions  of  the  country.   Sir G. Clayton himselfconcludes by saying that &quot; there is no  ground whatever for advocating the abandon-&quot;ment of the Zionist policy or relinquishing the Mandate&quot;; and by asking whether&quot;away cannot be  found, by modifying objectionable Articles in the Mandate, or at&quot;least by removing all possible grounds for any charges of partiality or bad faith,&quot; to dissipate the present fear and distrust of the Arabs.&quot;    That is the precise object with which we have put forward the  proposals contained in this Report.                                         Signed on  behalf of  the Committee,                                                  DEVONSHIRE.July 27, 1923.
