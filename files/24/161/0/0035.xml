[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet,     July 1923.SECRET.CP. - 335(23).CABINET.    Throughout the course of the discussions which have taken  place between  theColonial Office and the India Office on the Kenya problem, I have of course been in close and constant consultation with  the Government of India&apos;.&apos;  I have now  received, inthe telegram which I circulate below, the Government  of India&apos;s criticisms of  theproposafs contained in the Colonial Office Memorandum which is being placed beforethe Cabinet.  I  propose to take the opportunity of comznenting on this telegram whenthe subject is brought up for discussion in the Cabinet.    Kenya.   Reference  your telegram 2588, dated 12th July.  We fully appreciateeffort made to meet Indian position by the abandonment of all ideas of segregation,and by  the  statement of  policy that  His Majesty&apos;s Government could contemplate,only in  extreme circumstances, legislation designed to exclude from British Coloniesimmigrants  from any other part of the Empire.  Coming  to the principal  recotn-mendations contained in your telegram, our views are as follows :     Sections 1 and 2.  We have no observations to make on the general statementof policy embodied herein.    Section 4.  We  desire to  stand by the attitude taken up by us  in our telegram dated 11th September 1922, regarding the Wood-AVinterton  report.   In respect of acommon electoral roll, we recall that the principle of a common roll was accepted,not only in the Wood-Wmtertou Agreement, but also by  Mr.  Churchill, and was recently affirmed by the  Duke of Devonshire in his  Despatch to  the Governor of kenya dated 14th December 1922.   It is  a matter of  great disappointment to us thatthe Colonial Office now propose to  abandon this  principle in favour  of a system ofcommunal representation.  It is alleged, as a primary argument in  favour  of thelatter principle, that it is  compatible with African representation in due season and withArab representation  immediately.  We  point  out, however,  that a common electoralroll would still enable protection to he  given  to the claims of  these classes  by theprovision of reserved seats, the principle of which was accepted by the Wood-AVintertonproposals.   In  the second place, it is argued that the communal system of represen-tation permits  a wider  franchise for Indians.  AVe have always recognised  that acommon electoral roll  would,  at any rate in the first instance, reduce the size ofIndian  electorate.  We have, however,  been prepared  to  face  that disadvantage, inview of the importance  which we attach to the principle of  a common electoral roll,and in this we believe that we  have  always had a  great  body of Indian opinion in kenya  on our  side.   Thirdly, we clo not accept  the statement in the  Colonial Officedraft that the  advantage  of a common electoral roll is illusory.   On the contrary wehave always maintained, and we still maintain, that there is no prospect of composingthe racial differences and tension in Kenya unless and until Indians and  Europeansexercise the franchise on a common basis.  In this connection, we would refer  you tothe experience  already gained in the Cape Colony.   Our  objection to the communalsystem  is that it separates off Indians from Europeans, and, so long as this system ismaintained, the  two communities  would always tend to lay greater, emphasis on points  of difference than on  those of common interest.  Communal representation was reluctantly accepted  by us in India  at the  request of minority of communities, but experience is already tending to show that the system is leading to  the very dangers which we have emphasised  above.   We cannot  admit the analogy  of Fiji where conditions are altogether special, and where  Indians  themselves are in favour, for special reasons,  of  communal  representation.   We have already pointed out that      6558   100  7.23PEEL.20th July 1923.Telegram from  Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated                    mh July 1923.
Indians in Kenya prefer the principle  of a common electoral roll.   We desire to add that the reason why we attach so much importance to..the principle of a commonelectoral roll is that we cannot  in any way derogate from the claim which, we; have:always made, that  Indians in a Crown Colony must he accorded  equal  status withEuropeans.   We trust that His  Majesty&apos;s Government will find themselves able toaccept these views, which are strongly held in India.  If, however, the decision goesagainst us we hope  it will  be made clear, in any pronouncement  that&apos; His  Majesty&apos;s,Government may make, that the present arrangement is provisional only, and will be reviewed when any change in  the present system of Crown Colony  government is contemplated.   Your telegram is not clear as to the numbers of seats  to be reservedfor Indians  under the communal system.   If  we understand the proposal, correctlythe  number of European  seats will remain at  11, as  at present.  We.would remindyou thai; the Wood-WinterJpn proposals contemplated a reduction of European seats to seven, four seats being provided for Indians ; we then pressed for  a  ratio of fiveIndian to seven European seats, and  we again urge  the  maintenance of  the  same proportion.   ^Section 6. In Nairobi municipality, where there is not an official majority,  we donot agree to communal elections, and adhere to the views expressed in our Despatchdated 21st October 1920.                   ,     Section 7. We assume that the abandonment of segregation  applies equally  to the rural areas.     Section 8.  Highlands.  We adhere to the views expressed in para. 3 of  our telegram of  11th September 1922.    The right to  reopen this question should beasserted, and exclusion of Indians should not in any case be embodied in legislation.We  ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to  realise the impression created in India by thefact that this discrimination is specifically stated as being in favour of Europeans, andnot.  in favour of European British subjects.  It would,  therefore, be possible to grantlands  and permit their transfer in Highlands to Euiopeans of other nationalities, andeven to ex-enemy subjects, while excluding Indians on the plea of  a commitment alleged to have been given  by Lord Elgin, the validity of which we have always  seen reasonto doubt.  In this connection, we  would refer you to para. 6 of the observations  of theSecretary of State on the memorandum of die Secretary for&apos;the Colonies, forwardedwith India Office letter No.  I. and 0. 1267, dated 5th September 1,921.     Section  9.  immigration.  We welcome  the  principle  contained  in openingsentence of  this  paragraph.  The latter part  of  the paragraph,  however, seems to contemplate the enactment of an immigration law and the constitution of a Board inorder to supervise immigration into Kenya.   We note further that the purpose of thisjlaw  wibybe  to  protect the economic  interests o  the  Africans, and in particular toprevent the  inrmdulating numbers of artisans  and clerks from India.  This law, if a law  is intended,  will not include Indians&apos; as such.   Our experience,  however, of similar laws ,iu other parts of  the Empire leads us to apprehend lest the law may beso worked as to exclude Indians.   In practice, these immigration laws are justified inether dominions  op the same grounds for  economic arguments as are contained inthis  paragraph of your telegram, and we feel we have grave reason to fear that  if the immigration Board, as is proposed, is composed of a majority of Europeans, precisely the same results will follow as those of which we have had so unfavourable experience in other parts of the Empire.   We cannot  at present conceive  circumstances  underwhich it would  be justifiable to exclude Indian immigrants  of the class named-Finally; restrictions on Indian immigration into Kenya will be prejudicial to Indianinterests in  Uganda, and will also provoke unfavourable comparisons with right of entry enjoyed in Tanganyika under mandate.     In conclusion, if  His Majesty&apos;? Government are unable to  accept our views, weearnestly submit that wh.en their final decision is announced in the House of Commons,they should  take  steps to make  clear the attitude which the Indian Government hasassumed on this question.  It would  react very unfavourably on Indian opinion if itwere thought that we had acquiesced in, or failed to make representations  against, HisMajesty-&apos;s Government&apos;^ decision, if it should be in terms suggested.
