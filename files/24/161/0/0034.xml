On the 14th of February I circulated to my Colleagues a memorandum on theserious position which had arisen in Kenya out of the controversy over the status of indians in the Colony.  (CP. 99 (23).)   2. Since that date discussions have proceeded with the Governor and the delega-tions  which have accompanied him from Kenya, and with&quot;&quot;mr. Sastri, who has comefrom  India with other representatives of the Indian National Assembly.   Therehave,  also been several conversations; between the Seoretary of  State for India and myself.   3. I now place before my colleagues the annexed memorandum.  Part I contains a historical summary of the question.  In Part II are set out the statement of generalpolicy and the decisions on particular points at issue, to which I invite the concur-rence of  my colleagues.   Subject  to  their  concurrence,  I  propose that thememorandum should be  published as a Parliamentary Paper on the 24th of July, theday preceding the Debate on the Colonial Office Vote in the House of Commons.

INDIANS IN KENYA.                                   PART I.    1. THE  question  of the status of Indians  in  Kenya has come under  theconsideration of successive Secretaries  of  State for the Colonies in one form or another for many years; but with the recent change in the constitutional and political position of India, it has now become  a matter of Imperial policy, to which HisMajesty&apos;s Government  have given prolonged and anxious consideration in order toreach a settlement of the existing difficulties.    2. The history of the position of Indians in Kenya up to the  end of the late war may be summarised briefly.   There have been Indian merchants establishedalong the East African Coast for a long time, and, with the opening up of Ugandaand Kenya, and particularly with the development of British administration inthose  countries during  the last  thirty-eight years,  Indian traders have penetratedinto the interior.  Many Indian artisans and labourers employed on the  constructionof the Uganda Railway remained to engage in commerce,  and,  at the beginningof the present century, the  number of  Indians in Kenya was  greatly increasedby  the arrival  of  artisans, clerks  and small  traders.   There  is a  limited number, also, of professional  men and traders on a large scale who have come,from india to the  Colony.   The  agricultural Indian is, however,  almost  unknown in kenya.    3. It was the  question of the ownership of land in the Highlands which firstbrought Indian and European interests into conflict.  The Highlands, less the area in that region reserved for Africans, amount to about one-tenth of the total areaof the Colony and Protectorate, and  they are in climate unique in the great belt of tropical African possessions of the  Crown.  There were  a few European settlersfrom about 1897, but the encouragement of their immigration into the country as amatter of policy may be dated from 1902.   From that  time the influx of Europeansettlers increased  steadily.  The  policy  of the  reservation of  the Highlandsfor Europeans was definitely laid down by the Earl of Elgin, when Secretary ofState for the Colonies in 1908.    4. At that time the  unofficial element on the Legislative Council was entirelynominated, and in 1909 the experiment was tried  of adding an Indian nominatedmember.  This experiment did not prove entirely satisfactory,  and the appointment was not renewed when the term of office of the Indian concerned came to an end.    5. In 1913, a distinguished sanitation expert,  Professor (now Sir William)Simpson,  furnished a report  on  sanitary matters in Kenya, in which he advocatedstrongly a system of racial segregation,  both in the residential and in the commercialareas of the large  towns.   His  views were accepted, and, when the time came forapplying them after the  war, this question of segregation  formed one  of the main points at issue between the European and  the Indian communities.    6. At the end of  the  war  it  was decided to  give  effect to the long-standingdesire of the  European community  for representation on  the  Legislative council by means of elected  members.  The  grant of elective institutions was approved byViscount  Milner in  1919 and took effect at  the beginning of  1920.   The numberof European elected unofficial  members of the Council was  fixed  at eleven,  butprovision was made for maintaining  an official majority in  the Council.    7.  In  1918,  the report  of a  local  Economic Commission  of Enquiry intopost-war development was published.   This contained disparaging references  to the indians then  in Kenya,  and advocated strict control of future immigration from india.    Although the passages in  question were repudiated by Lord Milner as not representing the view either of His Majesty&apos;s Government or himself, the reportundoubtedly added to the feeling of bitterness among the Indians.     8.  At the same time Indian sentiment, both in India and Kenya, was becoming more and more articulate, and a large number of claims was  put  forward  by theIndian community  in Kenya,  including  a  demand  for  representation on  theLegislative  Council on  an equality with Europeans.   After full consideration and discussion,  Lord Milner addressed a despatch on the 21st May,  1920,  to the
Governor of Kenya,  conveying decisions on the  various  points  at  issue.    Thatdespatch has already been published locally in the &quot; Official Gazette.&quot;  The decisionsmay be summarised as follows :     (a.) Arrangements to be made for the election  of two Indian members of the          Legislative Council on  a special franchise.    (&amp;.) Arrangements to be made  for. elective  representation of  Indians on          Municipal Councils.    (c.) No restriction on Indian immigration which would place the natives of          India at a disadvantage as compared with other immigrants    (d.) Lord Elgin&apos;s decision in regard to the reservation of the Highlands for          Europeans  to be maintained, but reasonable  opportunity  to be a afforded          for Indian agricultural settlement in areas of adequate extent and good          quality which could be set apart for that purpose without infringement          of native rights.    (g.) The principle  of  race segregation to be adhered  to  in  residential areas          and,  whenever practicable,  in commercial areas also.    Other matters were dealt with, but these were of minor importance and need not now be recapitulated.    9.  The Government of India  reviewed the whole position in  a despatch of the21st October, 1920, which has been  published as Command Paper 1311.    This despatch re-opened  the  whole question  and led  to protracted discussion between the Secretary  of  State for the Colonies and the Secretary of  State  forIndia,  in which the points at issue were considered in relation not only to  Kenyabut also to the general political  position in  India.    This discussion  continue during the  spring and summer of 1921, and  in  that period also the matter was brought by the  Secretary of State  for India before the Joint parliamentary committee  on  Indian Affairs under the chairmanship  of Lord  Islington.   Thereport of the Committee has been published as House of Commons Paper 177.    10. The more general  question of the position of  Indians  in  the Empire came under discussion at  the Imperial  Conference of 1921.   At the  final meeting,  thefollowing Resolution was adopted :         &quot; The  Conference, while  reaffirming the resolution of the Imperial War    Conference of 1918, that  each community of the British Commonwealth should    enjoy complete control of the composition of its own population by means of    restriction on immigration from any of  the other  communities, recognises that    there is an incongruity between the position  of India as  an equal member of    the British  Empire  and the existence of disabilities upon British Indians    lawfully domiciled in some  other parts  of  the  Empire.    The Conference    accordingly is of the opinion that,  in the interests of the solidarity of the British    Commonwealth, it is desirable that the rights  of such Indians to citizenship    should  be recognised.&quot;    The following observations were appended to the Resolution:         &quot; The representatives of  South Africa regret their inability to accept this    resolution  in view; of the exceptional circumstances  of the greater part of the    Union.&quot;        &quot; The representatives of  India, while expressing their appreciation of the    acceptance of the resolution recorded above, feel bound to place on record their    profound concern at the  position of Indians  in South Africa, and their hope    that by negotiation between  the Governments  of India &apos;and of South  Africa    some way  can  be found, as  soon  as may be, to  reach  a  more  satisfactory    position.&quot;    11. The question of the settlement  of  the position in Kenya  was discussed between Mr. Churchill, then Secretary of State for the  Colonies, and  Sir EdwardNorthey, the Governor of Kenya,  who was on leave, and when Sir Edward Northeyreturned to Kenya in September 1921, he attempted to secure an  agreed settlement,but without success.    12. A  deputation of Europeans came to England in the following winter andan Indian deputation, consisting of persons  who were already  in  this country, was
 also received by the Secretary of State.   No progress, however, was made towards a settlement on this occasion.     13. An Interdepartmental Committee, consisting of the Parliamentary Under- Secretaries  of  State for the Colonies  and for India  (The Honourable Edward Wood, M.P., and the Earl Winterton, M.P.) with representatives of the two Offices, met several times during the summer with a view to arranging terms which would meet  the insistent demands received from India  for  a full measure of Indian representation  in Kenya  and, at the same  time, secure a settlement  acceptable in Kenya itself.   They drew up  a report, which was adopted provisionally by the Secretaries of State for reference to the Government of Kenya and the Government of India, in order to obtain a confidential  expression of the opinion of  both Govern- ments on the proposals.     14. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Coryndon had succeeded Sir Edward Northey as Governor of Kenya, and a telegram was  sent to him on the 5th of September,  1922, conveying the substance of what is now  known as the &quot; Wood-Winterton report.&quot; The terms of the proposed settlement as detailed in the telegram were as follows     (1.) Franchise. A common electoral roll for all British subjects and British- protected persons (male or female), aged 21 years and,upwards, possessing qualifica- tions which were to be prescribed.     (2.) Qualifications. Either  a complete census or  a test census to be held  in order to determine a method of adjusting qualifications which would approximately result in a  ten  per cent. Indian electorate.  To obtain this percentage it might be necessary to adopt  alternative property  or educational, qualifications  instead of a combined qualification.  Should the census show that  in order to get the ten per cent. the qualification standard would obviously be unreasonably low, reasonable standards would be laid down irrespective of the resulting percentage.  Qualifications to be settled in time to enable the new Indian electorate to vote at  the general election in March 1923.  European voters now on register would  be admitted to the new register whether or  not  in possession of the new qualifications, but all fresh  applicants for registration,  whether  Europeans  not registered under  the Legislative  Council Ordinance 1919, or Indians, would be required to possess these qualifications.     (3.) Constituencies. The official majority to be retained.  Alternative proposals as follows :-     (a.) Eleven elected  members representing seven  constituencies,  three  of which          . to return one member and four two members.   In the former, European           candidates only to be qualified for election:  in the latter,  there would           be one  European  seat  and one  Indian seat,  giving a  total  of  seven           Europeans, four Indians.     (b.) The  India Office suggested that there should  be twelve elected members           representing four  constituencies,  each  constituency  returning  three           members, or, alternatively, eleven  elected  members representing  four           constituencies, of which three would return three members  and one would           return two members.   One seat in each constituency should be Indian,           the rest  European, giving  eight  or seven Europeans according as the           total is  twelve . or eleven  elected  members  and  four  Indians.   This           alternative (b)  would  not prejudice  the position of the Europeans, and           might be more acceptable to the Indians.   The Government  of Kenya to           examine and report upon the possibility of giving effect to alternative (b),           but the reply to the telegram not to be delayed for  that purpose.     (4.)  Municipal  Franchise. Agreed  that in  municipalities Indians  must  begiven adequate  representation on an elected basis where such basis already existed for Europeans, but detailed arrangements  could not be decided upon until the receiptof a  despatch on the subject expected from the Governor.                          i     (5.) Executive Council. Provision already existed in the Constitution for the&apos;appointment of  such unofficial persons as  the Governor might appoint from time totime to the Executive Council.  There was now  one unofficial Indian member of theExecutive Council  under  this provision,  and  it should be  understood that  thisarrangement would continue.  -No distinction to  be made between Europeans andIndians in deciding on the fitness  of individuals to  be members of the ExecutiveCouncil.     (6.) Segregation. No segregation,  either commercial  or  residential, on raciallines, but the Colonial Government or municipal  authorities to have power to impose
                                  PART II.1. General Statement of Policy.    The general policy underlying any decision that may be taken on the questions at issue must first be determined.  It is a matter for satisfaction that, howeverirreconcilable the views of the European and Indian communities in Kenya on many points may be, there is one point on which both are agreed, namely, the importance      1102681                                                          oat their  discretion sanitary,  police and building  regulations,  subject  to  these regulations containing no racial discrimination as such.    (7.) Immigration. It would be announced  that in  present  circumstances nochange was contemplated in the existing regulations.    Note. The Secretary of State added a note on this subject as  follows :-&apos;         &quot;Throughout discussions with  India Office, I have made it plain that my    view is unchanged as to  immigration control, and that if the danger ever arises    of a large influx, of Indians  I  hold myself entirely  free to take action which    may be necessary.   In view of the figures  which you have supplied as to the    influx and efflux of Indians in 1921-22, I have not felt it necessary to insist on    any alteration of the law at present.&quot;    (8.) Highlands. The following to be the  terms of the announcement:          &quot;The Colonial Office cannot contemplate any change  in the existing law    and practice, having  regard to past policy and commitments.  The India Office    take note of this view, but are unable to accept it, and  reserve the right to reopen    the question, if need be, at some future date.&quot;    15. The Government of  India were  willing  to accept  the scheme, although theydid not consider  that it fully met the claims put forward on behalf  of the Indians.The Government of Kenya rejected the scheme mainly on the ground that it  gaveno sufficient safeguard to the European community against Indian predominance inthe future.    10. No immediate progress was possible for various reasons, but with the changeof Government,  in October  1922, discussions were  resumed between  the Secretaryof State  for  India and the new Secretary  of  State  for  the Colonies.   Thedesirability  of  arriving at  an  agreed settlement  was  impressed  upon,  theGovernor,  but  his discussions  with  the leaders  of the European  community in Kenya led to nothing.  The fears of the Europeans were rendered the more acuteby demands put  forward by Indian political  leaders in Kenya and elsewhere, whowere understood to state that they only  accepted the Wood-Winterton proposals as a basis for further demands, and that nothing short of the full equality of Indiansand Europeans would be satisfactory. The Europeans, seeing themselves outnumberedby Indians already by more  than two to one,  and fearing a  further large influx of indians a fear  which  later  figures of immigration furnished to the colonial government appeared to justify regarded  such  a claim as  establishing Indiandomination on the unofficial side of the Council and  as depriving the Europeanssooner or later of all representation on the Council.    It became obvious that the policy proposed&apos; in the Wood-Winterton report wouldnot satisfy parties in Kenya.  It was, therefore, arranged that a  European and an indian delegation should come  to  this country from Kenya, together with  theGovernor  for further  discussion.   The European  delegation  was accompaniedby  the  Reverend  Dr.   J.  W.  Arthur, selected  to  represent  the  views  ofthe Missionaries  in  Kenya  on the native interests  involved  in the controversy.A  delegation,   consisting  of  three  Indian  political  leaders,  headed  by  theRight Honourable Srinivasa Sastri, also came from India to represent the interestfelt by Indian public opinion in this question.  The delegations arrived in the courseof April and May 1923.   Every opportunity has been taken of ascertaining fully the views of the  several parties interested, and the question has now been reviewed in all its bearings.  As a result of this re-examination of the position, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have arrived at certain conclusions, which are set forth in the followingpart of this memorandum.
of safeguarding the interests of the African natives.  The  African population of kenya is estimated at more than 2^ millions; and according to the census of 1921,the total numbers of Europeans, Indians and Arabs in Kenya (including officials)were 9,651, 22,822 and 10,102 respectively.    Primarily, Kenya is an African territory, and His Majesty&apos;s Government thinkit necessary definitely to record their  considered  opinion that the interests of the african natives must be paramount, and that, if  and when  those interests  and theinterests of  the  immigrant  races should  conflict, the  former  should  prevail.Obviously,  the interests of the other communities, jiuropean, Indian or Arab, mustseverally be safeguarded.   Whatever the circumstances in which they have enteredKenya, there will be no drastic action or reversal of measures already introduced suchas may have been contemplated in some quarters, the result of which might be to destroyor impair the existing interests of  those who have already settled  in Kenya.   But,in the administration of Kenya, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government regard themselves asexercising  a  trust on behalf  of the African population,  and they are  unable to delegate or share this trust, the object of which  may be defined as the protection and advancement of the native races.   It is not necessary to  attempt to elaboratethis position; the lines of development  are as yet in certain directions undetermined,and  many  difficult  problems  arise,   which  require  time  for   their  solution.But there can be no room for  doubt that it is the mission of Great Britain  to workcontinuously  for the  training and education of the Africans  towards a higherintellectual, moral and economic level  than that  which they had reached, when theCrown assumed the responsibility  for the  administration  of  this  territory.   Atpresent special consideration  is being  given to economic development in the native reserves,  and within the limits imposed  by  the finances of  the  Colony all that ispossible for the advancement and  development of  the Africans,  both  inside  and outside the native reserves,  will be done.    His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to record that in their  opinion the annexationof the East Africa Protectorate,  which,  with the exception of  the  mainlanddominions  of the Sultan of Zanzibar,  has thus become a Colony, known as KenyaColony, in no way derogates  from  this fundamental conception of the duty of theGovernment to the native races.  As in the Uganda Protectorate,  so in the KenyaColony, the principle of trusteeship for the natives, no less than in the mandated .Territory of Tanganyika,  is unassailable.  This paramount duty of trusteeship willcontinue,  as  in  the  past,   to  be carried out under  the Secretary of State for theColonies by the agents of  the  Imperial Government, and by  them alone.2. Future Constitutional Evolution.    Before dealing with the  practical points at  issue  directly connected with theclaims of  Indians, it is necessary,  in  view  of the declaration  of policy  enunciatedabove, to refer to the question of the future constitutional evolution of Kenya.    It has been suggested that it  might be possible for Kenya to advance in thenear future on the lines of responsible self-government, subject  to the reservation of native affairs.   There are, however,  in the opinion of His  Majesty&apos;s Government,objections  to the adoption  in  Kenya at this stage, of such an arrangement,  whetherit take the form of removing all matters affecting Africans from  consideration inthe Council,  or the appointment of the Governor  as High  Commissioner for NativeAffairs, or provision  for  a special veto by the  Crown on  local legislation  whichtouches native  interests;  and  they  are convinced that the  existing system ofgovernment is in present  circumstances best calculated to  achieve  the aims whichthey have in view, namely,  the unfettered exercise of their trusteeship for the nativeraces and the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of other  communities resident in the Colony.    His Majesty&apos;s  Government cannot but regard  the grant of  responsible self-    government as out of the  question within  any period  of  time which need now be    Itaken into consideration.   Nor, indeed, would they contemplate yet the possibility    Iof substituting  an unofficial  majority in the  Council  for the Government official  -  Imajority.    Hasty   action   is  to be  strongly  deprecated,  and  it   will  be    1necessary to see how matters develop, especially in regard to  African representation,    before proposals for so fundamental a change in  the Constitution of the Colony can    be entertained.   Meanwhile, the administration of the Colony will follow the British    Itraditions and principles which have been successful in other Colonies, and  progress    j towards self-government must be  left to take the lines which the passage- of timeand the growth of experience  may indicate as being best&apos;for the country.               [
\3. Practical Points at Issue.  ,    Turning now to the practical points at issue  arising directly out of the claims of indians domiciled in Kenya, these may be considered under the following heads :         Representation on the Legislative Council.        Representation on the Executive Council.        Representation on Municipal Councils.        Segregation.        Reservation or the Highlands for Europeans.        Immigration.4, Representation on the Legislative Council.    (a.) Elective System. In no responsible quarter is it suggested that the indians in Kenya should not have  elective representation  upon the  Legislative Council of theColony.   The point at issue is the method whereby such elective representation shouldbe secured.   There are two alternative methods :         (i.)  A common electoral roll.        (ii.)  Communal franchise.    Under the  former system, Kenya  would be. divided  up into a given number of constituencies, in each of  which  European and Indian voters on the roll would votetogether at an election  for candidates of either race, and the qualifications for admission to the voters&apos;  roll would be the same for Europeans and for Indians.   Under the lattersystem, European and Indian constituencies would  be  demarcated  independently, notnecessarily coinciding in number or boundaries; the  qualifications for admission tothe voters&apos; roll would not necessarily be the same for the two communities ; and whileEuropeans would vote  in the European constituencies for European candidates, Indianswould vote in the Indian constituencies for  Indian candidates.    As  a variant of  the former  system,  there is the  common  electoral roll  with eservation of seats.  This arrangement would involve  the setting  apart  of a certainnumber of seats in a given constituency for candidates of  a  certain  race; for example,in a constituency returning three members, with two seats reserved for Europeans andone for Indians, the two European candidates and the one Indian candidate highest inthe poll would  be elected, irrespective of the position in the poll of other candidates of either race.    The common electoral roll for all British subjects and British  protected  persons, with reservation of seats, was  proposed in the  Wood-Winterton report,  and it was farther  suggested that the  qualifications  for voters should be such as to  admit, if possible, 10 per cent, of the domiciled Indians to the register.    For the. common electoral roll it is claimed that it would bridge the gap  between the Europeans and Indians by  giving a candidate  of one  race an incentive to study the needs and aspirations of the other race.  Further, Indian  sentiment, both in India and Kenya, strongly  favours the common electoral roll,  even though  a communal franchise exists in India itself.    A. communal  franchise secures that  every elector shall have  the opportunity of being represented  by  a member with  sympathies similar to his own, a consideration which in other Colonies  has led the domiciled Indians to press for its adoption;  it is well adapted to the needs of a country such as Kenya ; no justification is seen for the suggestion that it  is derogatory to any of the communities so represented, and  it is believed that, so far from having a  disruptive tendency, it  would contract rather than widen the division between races in Kenya.    So far as Africans are concerned, a communal franchise provides a framework into  which native representation can be fitted in due season.    From the point of view of  the Indian residents  themselves, this system permits of  i far wider  franchise being given than would be the case if  a common electoral roll  were  introduced, and this alone  should render it acceptable to all supporters of the  Indian claims who have at heart the  political development of the Indian people.  &apos;  Finally, it allows of the immediate grant of electoral representation with a wide  fcmchise to  the other  community in Kenya which is ripe for such institutions, the  Arabs of the Coast.    These  considerations were  weighed  before  the  Wood-Winterton  report  Was  awn up ;   the recommendation then made turned largely on the desire  to  meet  pdian  feeling  so far  as conditions in  Kenya would  admit.  The result of the  &quot;tfevence to  opinion  in Kenya of the recommendation that a common electoral roll
Hshould be adopted, even though combined with a reservation of seats, was to show-that the advantages claimed for the common electoral roll would in practice  have beenillusory.   In the special conditions existing in Kenya  it is  clear that no  candidate,European or Indian, could  stand  as  an advocate of the interests of the other racewithout sacrificing the support  of  his own.  If elections were to be fought on raciallines, as they undoubtedly would have been in Kenya, the main advantage claimed for thecommon electoral roll, namely, the bringing of the races nearer together, would be lost.     Having regard to all the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decidedthat the interests of all concerned in Kenya will be  best  served by the adoption of  acommunal system of representation.     (b.)&apos; Qualifications for  Voters. It is not intended to effect any alteration in the qualifications  for  admission  to. the  register of  European voters as  laid  down  inOrdinance No. 22 of 1919 : that  is to say,  adult suffrage, subject to certain necessary and  customary reservations.   Under the  communal system  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare  prepared  to grant to  Indians a wide  franchise.   It  will be  a matter for theGovernor of the Colony to ascertain the views of the Indian community and to submit,the necessary legislation to give  effect thereto.  The same procedure will be followed in the case of the Arab community.     (c.) Qualifications  for  Candidates.-His Majesty&apos;s Government  are prepared  toadopt a similar principle in regard to  the qualifications for candidates, except thatthere must be a.test which will ensure that candidates have such a knowledge of theEnglish language  as will enable them to  take  their part  in the proceedings of theLegislative.Council.  No system which would involve the use of two  or more official,languages in  the Council will be  contemplated ; but His Majesty&apos;s Government haveno ground for supposing that the imposition of  this necessary condition will  create difficulties or limit unreasonably the choice of suitable candidates.     (d.) Numbers on Legislative Council. The question then remains of the numbeiof seats on  the Council to he allocated  to  each community.  As matters stand, thenare eleven elected unofficials (Europeans) on the Council,  and as a provisional measurfauthority was  given in 1921  for the substitution of four nominated Indian members for the  two elected Indian members  contemplated  in Lord Milner&apos;s despatch of tin21st May, 1920.     After full consideration His Majesty&apos;s Government  have decided  to double tlinumber  of  Indian representatives proposed in Lord Milner&apos;s  despatch by makiiijprovision  for  four  elected Indian unofficial members on the Council;  while for t&apos;Arabs, it has been decided that there shall be one elected member in  addition to tlnominated Arab official member for whom provision already exists.   The Europeanwill  continue  to return eleven  elected  representatives.   The number of nominateofficial members will be fixed so as to maintain an official majority on the Council.     In  the  opinion  of His Majesty&apos;s  Government adequate representation  of  tliinterests of each commuuity will be secured by this allocation.  It is desired, howeveithat the views of  the-Indians in  Kenya should be  ascertained before a decision taken upon  the actual arrangement of  the constituencies  to be represented by tlifour Indian members.     If the area of  land in the lowlands  referred  to  in  paragraph 8 below  shouldtaken up by the Indian agriculturists, His Majesty&apos;s Government, would  be prepared ticonsider the creation  of a fifth Indian constituency, as soon as the number of  Indiasettlers in that area justified  the  step.  This constituency would return one  Indiaielected member, making five Indian elected members in all.     No articulate expression of opinion can be yet expected from the African tribes iiKenya, and the time has not  come to consider what should be their representation ont!)Council.   The educational development of individual natives will undoubtedly precetjthe political education of the general  body of natives ;  there  are indeed signs of thalready.     In  present circumstances,  the Governor  has  the  advice  of  the  Chief  Nath;Commissioner in all matters affecting the African  population and with the  officia-majority can ensure the enactment of any measures for the  betterment of the nativSwhich  may be  approved by His Majesty&apos;s  Government.    It  has,  however, bee)suggested that  a.nominated  unofficial  member  chosen from among the  Gliristia&apos;Missionaries in. Kenya specially to advise on such matters should be  added to tfeCouncil until  the time comes when the natives  are fitted  for  direct representationHis  Majesty&apos;s Government  see  no  objection  in   principle  to  this  arrangement
and  they  agree  that  provision  should  be made  accordingly.    It  will be ^ forthe  Governor  to  select  a suitable  person  for nomination from  time  to  time.It  will,  of  course, be  understood  that  there  is  no  question of  the representationof  the Missionary Bodies as such, and that consideration of religious denomination willnot affect the selection.  Nor  will the  nomination of this one member relieve theGovernor  and  his  advisers of  their full responsibility  for  representing  the nativeinterests.5.  Representation on Executive  Council.    As regards the Executive Council, the present position as set forth in the Wood-Winterton report will be maintained, except that  the Governor will be given authorityto  nominate as  an additional unofficial member  a  suitable person,  preferably  aMissionary, whose advice on matters  affecting Africans  will, in the opinion of theGovernor, be of value.6.  Representation on Municipal Councils.    The only municipality which has been set up  in Kenya is that of Nairobi.    The Municipal Corporations Ordinance No.  33  of 1922 provides for MunicipalCouncils to consist of so many Councillors as  the Governor shall  determine, and theappointment of these Councillors rests with  the Governor.    It was not desired to suspend the enactment of various amendments to the existing law which are included in this Ordinance until the policy  as to elections for MunicipalCouncillors had been determined ; consequently, the provision for the constitution of municipal Councils was re-enacted generally in the form in which it  appeared in the municipal Corporations Ordinance of 1909.    Lord Milner contemplated  in  1920 election  in lieu  of nomination  of MunicipalCouncillors, but  no concrete scheme was submitted by the Colonial  Government forgiving effect to that policy.)  The matter is one requiring  careful examination, but, inprinciple, if  an  elective  basis is now introduced, it follows  from the decision in regardto  the Legislative Council  that municipal representation must also  be on a  communalbasis,  due provision being  made for  the protection of the interests  of the Africansuntil  such time as they are fit to  exercise  a franchise.   It will be an instruction to the Governor to put forward proposals for considerationof  the Secretary of State for the Colonies after he has been able to consult his advisersin  Kenya.1.  Segregation in Toivnships.   The next matter for consideration is that of segregation of the European and  non-European races.   Following upon Professor  Simpson&apos;s report, a policy of segregationwas adopted in principle, and it was proposed by Lord Milner to retain this policy  bothon  sauitary and social grounds.   So far as commercial segregation is concerned, it hasalready been generally agreed that this  should be  discontinued.  But in regard  to residential segregation, matters have been in suspense for some time, and all sales oftownship plots have been held up pending a final decision on the  question of principle involved.  It is now the view of the competent medical authorities that, as a sanitationmeasure, segregation of  Europeans and  Asiatics  is not  absolutely essential  for thepreservation of  the health of the community;  the  rigid  enforcement of sanitary, police and building regulations, without  any  racial discrimination,  by the Colonial  and municipal  authorities  will  suffice.  It may well prove that, in practice  the  differentraces  will, by a natural affinity, keep together in  separate quarters, but to effect suchseparation by legislative  enactment except on the strongest sanitary grounds would not,m  the opinion of  His Majesty&apos;s Government, be justifiable.   They have  therefore decided that the policy of segregation as  between Europeans and Asiatics in the town-snips must be abandoned.   But for the present, at any rate,  it is considered desirable, as  in  other nativedependencies, to keep the residential quarters of natives, so far as may be practicable,separate from those of the immigrant races.   In the.case of individual natives, such asservants, strict segregation would be unworkable ;  but it is important  that, when areas have  been fixed in townships for native residence, those  areas should be regarded asdefinitely set aside for tho use of natives,  and no encroachment thereon by non-Africanraces  should be permitted.

8. Reservation of Highlands.     As early as 1906 the question of the grant of land in  the  Highlands to non-Europeans had  arisen for consideration, and Lord Elgin, who was then Secretary ofState for the Colonies, informed the Commissioner (now styled Governor) that it  wouldnot  be  in accordance with the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to restrict any section  of His Majesty&apos;s subjects from holding any land in British Protectorates;  but liethought, in view of  the  comparatively limited  area of the  East Africa Protectoratesuitable for European cultivation, that a reasonable discretion should be  exercised indealing with applications for land from natives&apos; of India or other non-Europeans.  Theprinciple  which had  been acted upon by the previous  Commissioner,  namely, that agricultural land in the Highlands should be granted only to Europeans, was approved.     Lord Elgin confirmed his decision in 1908, stating that, while it was not consonantwith the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government to impose any legal restrictions upon any section  of the community, grants  in the upland  area should not,  as  a matter of administrative convenience, be made to Asiatics.     It has been claimed  on the side  of  the Indians, first, that Lord Elgin&apos;s decisiononly related to the initial grant of Government land in the Highlands, and that it has since been stretched so as to preclude the transfer of land from Europeans to indians in that area, and further, that Lord  Elgin&apos;s statement that no legal restrictions shouldbe imposed has been  varied by the terms of the Crown Lands Ordinance of 1915.     At  the time of  Lord Elgin&apos;s  decisions, Government land  in the  East  AfricaProtectorate  was alienated by allotment by the  Lands  Office, and.  the Commissionerhad  the power of veto on all transfer  of  land between private holders.   In view ofthis  general  veto, it  was unnecessary for Lord Elgin  to deal specifically  with thequestion of transfer,  and, although  no  public statement was  made  on  the point, it isclear that the question of land in the East Africa Protectorate was considered by his successors  and the local authorities on  the  basis  that the reservation of the Highlands Ito Europeans must cover transfer as well as original grant from the  Crown.     In the consideration of land policy which led to the enactment of the Crown Lands IOrdinance  of 1915, it was decided:      (a.) To substitute for the system of selling land by allotment the system of sellingi           leases at public auction.     (b.) To abolish the Governors general power of veto on transfer, which was foundI           to interfere  unduly with  the lessee&apos;s ability to  deaLwith his land by I           mortgage, &amp;c.     In order to apply these decisions in a manner consistent with the. principle of the reservation of the Highlands to Europeans, it was found necessary  to provide that in Iannouncing the conditions of  the sale  of particular farms, the Land Officer  should state (in cases where  the point  arose) whether the bidding at  the auction was limited Ito Europeans or not.   To deal with  the case of transfer it wasmecessary to retain, in almodified Jorm, the Governors power of veto, and this matter was very fully considered Iby Air. Harcourt (the  late Viscount Hareourt), who was Secretary of State at the time.lie refused to agree to.a veto on transfers between Europeans and Asiatics involving adefinite racial discrimination ;  but, in  order not  only to deal  with the particular caseof the Highlands,  but at the same, time to secure protection for non-European  land-holders (particularly in the coast strip which now  forms the Kenya Protectorate) against their being victimised by concession hunters, he approved  of- provision being made toretain the power of veto on transfers between persons of different races.  .     It  will be observed that  the passages  in  the Crown Lands Ordinance of 1915which have been complained of raised no new principle, but merely maintained theprinciple  of  past  practice.   .\&apos;or  can it be  claimed  that  they amount  to  legaldiscrimination against Indians, for it would  be possible for the Executive Governmentto grant land in the Highlands to an Asiatic, or to approve of  the transfer of land froma European to an Asiatic, without any alteration in the existing law.     In adhering  to  the position adopted by his predecessors in  this  matter. lord milner, when Secretary of State, made it clear  that the reservation of a certain area for Europeans implied that a similar reservation  should be  available for Indians who wished to take up agricultural land, and he contemplated a reservation of such land inthe  Lowlands of Kenya,  on  the understanding  that the land offered to Indian settlerswould  be  examined  as to its  suitability and adequacy by a&apos;  representative whom theIndian  Government might send.
9. Immigration.    Finally, the question of immigration into Kenya has been canvassed both by the europeans and by the Indians.  It is sufficient to say that  the line taken has  variedwith the point of view, and it is  not necessary to present the  arguments which havebeen advanced.    It may be stated definitely that only in extreme circumstances could His Majesty&apos;sGovernment contemplate  legislation  designed   to  exclude from  a British Colonyimmigrants from any other part of the British Empire.    Such  racial discrimination inimmigration regulations, whether specific or implied, would not be in accord with  thegeneral  policy of  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,  and they  cannot  countenance  theintroduction of any such legislation in Kenya.    The existing Immigration Regulations of the Colony are of quite general applica-tion.  It is clearly as important in the general interests of Kenya  to prohibit the entry of undesirable persbns from Europe or America as from Asia.  There is  no  reason to suppose that the Regulations in present circumstances are inadequate for this  general purpose.   But  the  consideration which must govern immigration policy in  Kenya ispurely economic, and strict regard must be paid to the interests of the African.  Whenthe  question is  re-examined from  this standpoint,  it is evident to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that some  further control over  immigration in  the  economic interests  of  the natives of Kenya is required.   The primary duty of the Colonial Government is the advancement of  the African, and it  is incumbent upon them to protect him from aninflux of  immigrants  from  any  country that  might  tend to  retard  his  economic development.    In course  of time, as  the natives  progress intellectually,  they  will no doubt takethe  place which Africans hold in other parts of British Tropical Africa in mechanicaland subordinate clerical work, and in small trade, and it must be the aim of the british administration to  further this development by all possible  means.   With this objectthe  Colonial Government must weigh, so far as may be practicable, the effect on nativeinterests  of  the admission to the  Colony of would-be immigrants of any race.  Npinformation is yet available to show what number of immigrants following a particularoccupation  the Colony can absorb.   The problem is complicated by the position of the separate Dependency of Uganda, to which the normal access lies through Mombasa andthe  Kenya Colony, and  this necessitates careful  consideration before any scheme isdefinitely decided upon. Further, some arrangement must  be devised for securing a strictly impartial examination  of applications for entry into Kenya, possibly by a Boardon which the various communities,  including the natives,  would be represented.   Itwill, therefore, be an instruction to the Governor  of Kenya to explore the  matter further on Ms return to the Colony,  and,  in concert  with the Governor of Uganda, tosubmit proposa s to the Secretary of State for the Colonies for  giving effect to that amount of control of immigration which the economic interests  of  the  natives  of bothdependencies require. 10. Gonelusion.    In  conclusion,  His M.ajesty&apos;s Government  desire  to  record that the decisionsembodied in this memorandum have  only been taken after an exhaustive considerationof the several complicating factors which have led to the present unhappy controversy.Iheir constant endeavour  throughout their  deliberations has been  to relate  theprinciples which  must govern  the  administration  of  a British Colony in  tropical africa  to the  wider considerations of general Imperial policy  as  enunciated in  theResolution of  the [Imperial  Conference of 1921.   It is  regretted, that on certain    After reviewing the history of this question and taking into consideration the factsthat during the last fifteen years European British  subjects have been encouraged todevelop the Highlands, and that  during that  period  settlers have taken up land in the highlands on this understanding, His Majesty&apos;s  Government have  decided that theexisting practice must be maintained as regards both initial grants and transfers.    An area of land in the Lowlands which can be set  aside  without infringing  onnative reserves and without conflicting with native requirements  will  be temporarilyreserved in order that  it may be ascertained by experience what demand there is foragricultural land  on  the part of Indians who will give suitable  guarantees  of  their intention  to  develop the land  themselves.  After the expiration of  a  limited  period,the reservation  of this area in the  Lowlands will be reconsidered in the light of theexperience so gained.
material points it has  not been possible to meet the  wishes of the Government ofIndia,  but it is not  to  be expected that issues so grave  can be  composed  to theimmediate satisfaction of the several interests concerned.   His Majesty&apos;s Government,however, believe that the decisions now taken, resting as they do on the broad basis ofthe British trusteeship  for the  African,  provide an equitable  adjustment of  those interests.   It is the confident  expectation  of His Majesty&apos;s Government that,  if thewhole matter is viewed  in its true perspective, decisions  so based will  be accordedgeneral acceptance, and it is their earnest  hope that  a sincere  effort will be made to restore in Kenya that spirit of co-operation and good-will so essential to its welfare anddevelopment.o
