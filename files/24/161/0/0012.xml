JJU-mrs DOCUMENT IS THE. PRflFERTYj OF, HIS^BRITANNIC. MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT^       SECRET.       -                  CABINET.       Q.P.33g(25).                Memorandum by the President of the Beard of Trade.                 I have on several oeoaslone circulated to the            Cabinet  a note of the review of trade conditions and            prospects given to me at the monthly meetings of the            Board of Trade Counoll.   This body comprises representa-            tivea of the chief Industries of the country, bankers,            merchants and the manager of the largest British railway.            The  opinions expressed at these meetings give a far more            complete and accurate view of the situation than I can            obtain in any other way.                 The attached Memorandum is a record of the last            meeting held on the 4th July, and my colleagues will see            that it covers practically the whole field.   It presents            a glocmy picture - and it will be observed that there was            almost  complete unanimity as to the condition of trade andI            to the  cause.   Recent trade returns are no criterion of            future  prospects.  Trade after trade tells the same story.            Orders  are being executed, but fresh orders are not            coming  in.   By common consent the condition  of Europe            is the  cause  of the slump, and there is general agreement            that unless we can effect a settlement of Reparations and            the Ruhr, we  shall have to face unemployment on a more             serious scale  than ever during the coming winter.                  The  only  satisfaction I can draw from the account             lies In the testimony that a great change of feeling Is             taking  place  in the country, and that public opinion in             the industrial districts will not merely support but             demand a  definite British policy.&apos;         P.

                          THE TRADE  OUTLOOK.          The  President first read the following remarks, which had   &apos;    heen  received from members who were unable to bo present sir CHARLES ADBI8:-   It is astonishing in China how trade  continues    to  be oarried on despite the ohaotic political conditions of    the country.   The old staples of Chinese industry, Tea and Silk,    are well  maintained.   The relative importance, however/, of    Tea and Silk in the trade of China has teen much diminished    of  late years by the extensive growth of a variety of  other    exports,  of Whioh Hides,  Oil Seeds and Albumen are the    principal.   For many of these articles Germany was formerly    China(s test customer and, until, the restoration of German    purchasing power  has heen at least rendered possible  by a    settlement of the question of the Ruhr,  trade is likely to    remain dull and- any further development rendered impracticable.         Until a greater demand has been oreated on the Continent    or  elsewhere for the raw materials of China an&amp; the Far East,    there must be a check  to  the  export of manufactured goods from    Europe.  &apos;         The-import trade  of China,  unlike  the export  trade,  is    suffering severely from politioal disorder.    Stooks  are  not    large  but in present  conditions  dealers  are  afraid to  stock at    all;  the  danger of being robbed of their  goods is  too great.    The same  fear of banditti induces the  up-country dealer to reduce    his purchases at the  Treaty Ports.   Where formerly he would  buy    twelve or  twenty bales of piece  goods, he will now only take   one    or two at  a time  for fear of  being robbed  by the way.         In  Japan business generally is  very dull.  Stooks of Silk are    moderate,  but prices  are  still too high  and transactions are few.    The importation of  foreign oapital  (c,f. recent loans  in Hew York    and London)  which  it has  hitherto been the policy  of  the Government    to discourage,  has  had a  strengthening effect  on exchange.  Japan    appears  to be well  supplied with  gold at home-and with  funds abroad&apos;.    Shore  has  been  some  talk  of removing  the embargo on the export  of    Gold and although,  no  doubt, Japan would  like  in this matter to                                   -4-
I     take a lead from Jingland,  it is possible that she may get tiredI     of waiting and conceive it -to he in her best interests to proceedi     alone.I          In the Straits Settlements,  hopes in the early part of the year     of a settlement in Europe  stimulated trade by way of anticipation.     Prom January to April exports of both Tin and Rubber were rather     larger  than during the&apos;corresponding period of last  year.  These     early hopes have died down.    iiirports are held up by delay in the     settlement of Reparations  and the ,   -Ruhr.    Business is at a     standstill.          In India,  a fair amount of business continues to be tran-     saoted  with America in Jute  products.   Other exports are dull.     The  price  of wheat has fallen without leading to  muoh business.     Imports are  stagnant,  influenced by the Monsoon,-the advance  of     which&apos; has  been general but weak.    To-day reports are better  and     with improved weather  conditions  trade should improve also.    But     in India,  as in the Jar east generally,  the  dominant factor is the     settlement of the  Ruhr and Reparations,  and  until that has  been     accomplished any material  improvement in trade seems unlikely.SIR ROBBRI GLABPXBiLD:-    Since reporting at the Meeting on June  13th,     there has  been no  improvement  to  report  in the wholesale clothing     trade - in fact,  rather the  contrary,  for June has not been a     satisfactory month.          Trade gave&apos; promise of being  good at the  commencement  of  the     year, and  for the  first three  or  four months  business was     fairly  satisfactory,  but in  May. it was not good and  the     weather in June seems  to have  considerably stopped the Home     Trade.   The warmer  weather  may cause a spurt,  but I am afraid     it has  come  too late.          The jjJxport Trade  with South  Africa goes  on showing a. little     improvement.          The independent spirit  of the  greater number  of the Woollen
   -. Manufacturers&apos;ha-s . somewhat departed.                    ^ 0          Most of the Clothiers are  behind in their turnover as     compensation&amp;red with the first six months ,,-of last year.MR GOODS HOUGH;  There has been no evidence of -any increase in the     supply of. commercial bills, and the  number of documentary     credits opened for exports has  declined somewhat.  This is to     some extent, seasonal, but it reflects also the uncertainty     which the unsatisfactory position on the Continent has produced,  j     Money rates have been firmer, partly due to the approach of     the half-year, and partly as the result of the increasing     effect produced by the divergence in interest rates in London     and In New York.                                                -          The downward movement in prices  in America has been     reflected in a decline in the New York - London Exchange Rate.   j     This movement may have been due In part also to the number of     foreign loans recently floated in London, and the transfer of     funds to New York because of the higher rates prevailing there.--          There is no great surplus  of funds in the London Money     Market, and it does not seem likely that there will be a return  j     of very easy conditions.SIR CHARLES WRIGHT;  tinplate TRADE.  This trade is at the moment,     fairly well booked on old orders, but there has been a decided   j!:     slackening off during the last  5/6 weeks, and things at the     present time do not look favourable.   It must be admitted,     however, that this trade has had a satisfactory run during      lj     the last 9 months.                     GALVANISED SHEETS.   This trade has also fallen     off,.both in Galvanised&apos; and Black Sheets, and enquiries at the   j!     moment are scarce and the outlook not promising.                     HEAVY STEEL TRADE.   This Is still in a very     bad condition,  and at the moment all orders being booked for     Rails, Sections or Plates, have to be taken at a loss.  Com-                              ...                                   if!     petition is also prevalent from the Continent for Billets and     Slabs, which interfere with any remunerative price being     obtained in this country for these  commodities.                           -         -6-               !
SIR GLYNN WEST:  TRADE. IMPROVEMENT  AND SUBSEQUENT  CHE OK.   In     October last,  I said that  &quot;evidence Is  not  wanting that     stocks throughout the world are  rapidly  reaching exhaustion,     so that even the policy of buying from  hand to mouth must,     at an early date, result In the  placing of  larger  orders&quot;.     I do not think this was an inaccurate forecast, beoause towards     the end of last year, and in the earlier months, of this year,     there was undoubtedly an appreciable improvement  in  trade, and     more particularly in the iron  trade.   This was very evident     in the Pearson Knowles group: of  companies,  which  is  controlled     by Messrs. Sir W.G.Armatrong,  Whitworth and Company,  and the     Partington Company felt justified In starting another furnace     In blast.  Messrs. Ryland Brothers, also in the same  group,     have experienced a distinct improvement. But for  some reason     the volume of orders has not been maintained.          It may be that the barest replenishment  of stocks has     been made to suffice.  Possibly, also,  the  increase  of pricee     which naturally accompanied the  Increasing  demand  tended to     check the improvement, such as it was.          OCCUPATION OF THE RUHR AND  TBS EXCHANGES. In any case,     it is difficult or impossible  to tell what  hag been  the effect     of the occupation of the Ruhr..on the trade  of thi3 country.     At first it appeared as if the reduced  productive  oapacity of     Germany would help our trade,  and doubtless it did up to a     oertain point, but I think that  the first and last thing that     is required to bring about a permanent  improvement In trade     la a permanent settlement of the political  situation.  Until     that desired end is achieved there is,  I am afraid,  little     hope for the trade and prosperity of the oountry.  It is un-     doubted that many European and other countries are still     greatly in need of reconstructIve material, but their in--     ability to pay for it Is due to  the disturbed state,  of the     exchanges of the world.SIR FREDERICK LEWIS: I regret to say  there is no alteration since     the last Meeting when you remember I reported the  Shipping     Industry was In a more depressed condition  than I  had ever     known it in my experience and, if anything, the condition is..     woree rather than better;   and I cannot see any indications     of improvement in the near future, particularly with  the     oontlnued unsettled political  outlook.                                 -7-                   .     &apos;
                                                           too        The President then invited the members of the Council   present to express their views.MR. SANDERSON:  The conditions in Australia continued good.  There   had been a certain set-back in the Wool trade, but not so much   as had been expected.   As regards Wheat, it was early as yet   to make a forecast, but the prospects were at present good on   aooount of the rain.   The latest shipments of Meat and meat   products showed an improvement both as regards quality and get-up   this indioated that labour in Australia was working better. . The   Metal industry, however, was in an unsatisfactory condition.   Internal trade was good, and the present position was favourable   now that the drought had broken.COLONEL ARMSTRONG:  In regard to engineering, he could report   nothing more hopeful than he had done at the previous meeting.   General engineering waB in a very bad state, and no orders were   coming in.   Speaking for industry in general, from the point of   view.of the Federation of British Industries, he said that   inquiries  and reports continued very unsatisfactory;  sporadic   orders only were being placed;  a little merohanting was being   done, but  no trade.   Buyers everywhere were holding back.  In   the foreign market the condition of the exchanges hampered   everything.   Even if the situation in the Ruhr were settled,   this would only be a first step, and it would still remain to   get the currencies into a sound and stable condition.  The   immediate  effect of a settlement in the Ruhr might be a   fictitious boom, but there would follow from it gradually a   return to  sounder currency and trade conditions.SIR A. SHIRLEY BENN:  He had received a letter from a big   employer of labour in the United States, who looked for   serious labour troubles in that oountry during the next few
   months.   There was a great shortage of unskilled labour, which   was leading to the transfer of negro labour from the Southern   to the Western States;-  this situation might have an effect on   the exporting capacity of the United States.   He agreed that   until a solution could be found for the iluhr question, a trade   revival oould not be looked for.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR:  One direction in whioh the Ruhr situation   was affecting trade prejudicially was through the resultant   inorease in the price of coal, ooke and steel.   Steel prices   had risen by  3 a ton since the 1st January, and buyers were   holding off in oonsequenoe.        The trade in iron and steel with Japan was bad, but good   with China.   Business in better olass and oruoible steel   was better than it had been for some time;  the demand came from   the Smpire and South America, but not at all from the United   States, where the 40$ duty had killed it.   Internal prices for   steel in the United States had not risen to an extent corres-   ponding to the duty, though certain increases had taken place:   thus, for example, their price for high speed steel had risen   by some 15 to 20 oents a ton, and that of tungsten from 42 cents   to 1 dollar.   The result was to leave to the British industry   so far as the United States were conoerned, only  oddments of   orders, which were insufficient to oover expenses.        He had heard from his Shanghai manager that the Japanese   were lending money privately in China, as we do, but that if   they did not get these loans repaid, they brought Government   pressure to bear in order to secure themselves concessions.   This practice might have a damaging effect upon us.
                                                            1 02MR. SUTCLIFFE SMITH:  Wool  combers were short of work,     .    and  spinners were experiencing difficulty in getting orders.    The  home  trade was stagnant at the moment, though it was true    that this  period of the year was generally a slaok one.  He was    of opinion that a return to good trade could only be obtained    by a political settlement In Europe.        Unemployment in the Bradford district was worse than it    had  been a month previously, and there was also more abort time.   More demands wjre however being received from the United States,    and  there  seamed to be a revival of Inquiries and orders from    India.  In China, Insecurity militated against trade.   That    country was bare of stocks, but there was a heavy risk In    sending goods up country.  He thought however that the Chinese   had  never had offered to them such perfection of design In   textiles as now, and that if the present  insecurity oould be   removed there would be an active trade.   There was at  present  a    strong boycott In China against the Japanese on account of the   severe economic clauses which Japan had Imposed on China some   years ago - though she was not at present enforcing these.   As a   result, British manufacturers were able to make inroads Into   the Japanese textile market In China,  which  amounted ie,   some 45,000,000 yards  per year.        A Boubaix manufacturer had informed  him that  no unemploy-   ment existed there,  but that whenever a  little slackness made   itself felt the employees found occupation on reconstruction   work in the devastated regions.   A serious feature of  the   present situation was  that where  before the  war British manu-   facturers had had 15% of  heir Wool combed in the  iiorth of   England&quot; and only 25% abroad, the  position was  now  reversed,   and 75% was combed abroad.  The German price for the work   was about half the British price,  and the French,  three-    quarters  to two-thirds.  Stabilisation of the exchanges was    the  first  requisite for recovery.  At present the great    difficulty confronting British traders was that they did not/know
     know whom to trust, and could not get In their money     from abroad.  MR. TAIT:  Had not much to add to his previous month&apos;s report     in regard to Non-Ferrous Metals.  This trade had been     reasonably busy at the beginning of the year, but there     was now a slacking off of orders: buying was of a     hand to mouth character, and Order books revealed a great     diminution in orders during the last few months.         With regard to the Motor Tyre industry, he mentioned    that Michelin&apos;s - our ohief foreign competitors - had last    year made a price-cut of some 85 to 50%, notwithstanding the    rise in rubber prices;  this week they had made another of        -t    10$.  This would have a serious effect on the tyre industry    in this country.   He thought that the depreciation of the    franc had been at least a  contributory factor,In making this    possible.   Mr.  Tait was satisfied that even at  this reduced  -: figure Michelinfs could make a substantial  profit on their    trade in England, and were using this to develop their business.    In South America, South Africa and elsewhere.   This latest    cut was not,  his thought,, Of a speculative character,  but could    be justified  by Michelin&apos;s cost prices;  they had also  reduced    their price in Prance,  but perhaps this  was  in  order to meet    Eunlop&apos;8 competition there.         The President remarked that,  even when  the  French  exchange    had been stable,  he had noticed that  French  tyre prices were    lower than British prices.  Mr.  Talt  said this was  BO.MR. RgLROYD:  Could report  nothing favourable.   Last month    matters had become worse rather than  better, and the    position was  indeed becoming almost desperate.   The American    section of the  Cotton trade  was in an especially bad condition,    and the Federation had  decided to  stop work  for  a fortnight    in July and a fortnight In August,  in addition to the usual                                 -11-
holiday.  The Egyptian section was in-a better condition thanthe American, but in consequence of this a certain number ofmills in the American section were changing over to deal withEgyptian cotton, and the result might be that the Egyptiansection might ultimately find itself in as bad a position asthe American.  A number of artificial remedial measures hadbeen suggested, such as fixing of&quot;prices, but these were at best only palliatives: the only true remedy was to bringdown the cost of the raw material.    It was possible that there might be some drop in October, as a result of the new cotton crop then coming forward.    Mr.Evan Williams: The coal export trade had experienceda set back during the last month.  There had been a drop in price and a reduction in the volume of exports.    Itwas a serious feature that American competition was now againable to make itself felt, assisted by lower freights.     Coalfreights from the United States to Atlantic ports now stood at dollars a ton, and to Italy 3 dollars.    It was now evidentthat during the recent boom the price of British coal forexport had been pushed up too high a level; about 40/- a tonwas then being asked for Y^elsh coal.     Germany was nowbuying much less,  and the same was  true of Italy.  In the home trade there was no material change.to report:  prices mighttend to come down a little, though  they had never risen tothe same degree as export prices.   Three months&apos; contractswere more general than any other at the present time;  themajority of current railway contracts were for three months.The future course of prices was difficult to forecast, buti,ir.Williams thought there would be  more buying shortly. - Evenif a settlement were reached in the Ruhr, it would be a  considerable
    time before France and Italy could obtain any material    increase In-their supplies.  Some measure of political    stabilisation in Europe appeared necessary to revive oon-    fidence.         As regards coke, the price had fallen considerably for    export, but not much for the home market.  A steady con-    sumption in future might be anticipated,  at reduced prices. SIB EDWIN STOCKTON:   The trade In piece goods,  though baa,    had not become worse.   The root of the difficulty was the    high cost of production;  the world  was short  of supplies    and there was  a big market waiting  for the advent  of lower    prices; unfortunately the 3hort-time  working  by spinners    was putting off that day;  this  might  be inevitable,  but  it    had accentuated the price  difficulty.   The cost of  the    raw material was much higher than the  markets  could  afford.    He  could  see little hope  of a reduotion,  except  for  forward    supplies  in anticipation  of the new cotton crop.   There    seemed  no likelihood  of any quick solution; time alone could    provide a remedy.         The  President  enquired whether Sir Edwin would  look    with confidence for lower prices in November.  Sir Edwin    Stockton  replied that  forward prices for November at present -&apos;  showed  a  reduction  of  about  2d.  a lb,  but many spinners in    the  American Section were losing more  than 2d. a lb. now,    and  consequently oould not  afford to reduce their prices.    The  effect  in the cloth section was that, while futures were    being bought for the winter months at  a reduction of 2d. a    lb., manufacturers  and spinners would  not sell on that basis,    so  that the benefit of the drop would  not be felt.   He    anticipated that it would he  necessary to continue charging    high prices for a considerable time to come.MR. HOLROYD:  Thought that the United States crop would, be   better  than the growers had been giving us to understand.
   The Cotton Spinners1 Federation had sent out invefftigato-rs to   the States, ana he hoped to receive good news from them.   With regard to Bhort-time working, spinners at present had   no option; even during the time at present being worked   (only 50$ full time) the mills were employed only up to   two-thirds of their productive oapaoity.MR. WATS0I3:  The tonnage handled by the London, Scottish and   Midland Railway group gave no indication of any expansion of   trade; one was forced to the conclusion that the Ruhr situation   was preventing progress in this oountry.  On the other hand,   traffio returns showed no diminution,  but remained at the level   of previous months.OOLOIffiL viflLIiEY:  Could oonfirm Mr. Sutoliffe Smith&apos;s remarks; the   peak had been reached in December and January last,  and a   decline was now taking place with increasing rapidity.   During the last two or three months, indeed, there had been   an absolute withering away of trade.  There was unemployment   in the West Riding, in addition to under-employment.    The   only business now being a one was the delivery of contracts   booked several months ago, and there were prospects  of Bevere   unemployment.   Both spinners and manufacturers had  large   order sheets for four or five month ahead but were  unable   to get the requisite specifications of what was required,   and orders were not being taken up.   This was due  0 the   faot that expert houses and  merchants  were finding great   difficulty in getting in their money from foreign countries.   Replacement costs would be fully 15$ above to-day&apos;s  costs;   this was an indication of the bad state of world trade.   He thought that this was not so much the outcome of  the loss   of direct business with Germany as of the indirect effect of   the present situation on other countries which normally   trade with Germany.
         In the present slack condition of the market he    thought that French offers of comparatively small volume    were apt to produce exaggerated fears here.   It was true    however that the French mills , were working up to. HCfc to    120 . of their pre-war capacity in Lille, Tourcoing and    Roubaix;  the lower working costs which obtained in France,    coupled with the depreciation of the &apos;franc, made it impossible    for us to meet their competition.   As regards the opinion    which he expressed at a.previous meeting, that the volume of    French importation into this country was not great,    Colonel Willey said that he based this on the trade returns,    which showed an excess of imports over exports to the extent    only of about one million yards per month.   The activity    which had prevailed in combing had resulted in a large    stock of tops in this country:  then, as a result of the    falling off of business, British wool importers had begun    to re-export the material ear-marked for. use in this    country to Germany, and even to Russia.   The combing costs    in Germany were less than half those ruling in this country,    and the case.was similar in Italy.   Prospects in this    country were distinctly disquieting.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE:  His bank received returns, every month from    the various parts of the country, and these confirmed the    remarks of previous speakers, and showed a setback    practically everywhere.   The only recovery shown was in    China Clay, which was not a very important trade.   These    facts were reflected in banking figures;  the trade demand    for advances was less, except for the purpose of helping    traders over bad periods.  There was a great desire for    goods all over the world, but this Could not be  converted    into an effective demand until confidence was restored.    A settlement in the Ruhr was a necessary condition for    revival.
-IS-kR.  LINDSAY;   Had not much change  to report,  as  regards  India,    Exports  remained at a level of some   20,000,000  per  month,    and Imports  about  13,000,000;  this favourable  balance  of     7,000,000 had continued steadily during each of the past    six months.    The net balance  of trade had depended  on    imports  of bullion, but there  were now signs that these    were falling off.  The position In regard to piece goods    continued practically unchanged.  It was a curious fact  that    exports  of wheat had not Increased materially,  although  there    had been a bumper crop;  In fact, forward quotations were    higher than  spot quotations;  ,it was just possible at present    to do business with Europe on spot quotations,  but nothing    for forward  delivery,uR.  PUGH:  Unemployment and under-employment were Increasing in    the iron and steel industry:  the more favourable tendenoy    of trade which had shown itself earlier in the  year  appeared    to be spent, and stagnation was setting in in the heavy    branches of  the industry.  This seemed likely to continue till    some international settlement could  be reached.    The steel    trade in Wales was doing better than elsewhere,  but  was    dependent largely on the tin plate and sheet trades,  Malleable    iron was bad.SIR WILLIAivi PEARCB:  The check to progress which had been    experienced in the chemical trade had now turned into    evidence of definite lost ground, though the set-back was    probably not so severe as in other trades.  The heavy branch    was better than the fine chemicals branch of the industry,  and,    curiously enough, in heavy chemicals the export trade was better    than the home trade.  This was the result of the cessation  of    competition from Germany, though a certain amount of increase  in    Belgian production was now making itself felt.   The  -
   ordinary chemical and fine chemical trades were losing   ground.        He observed that, as he had forecast at a previous   meeting, the French had laid hands upon the German Chemical   industry.   It was a matter of very serious concern that   the French had seised large quantities of dj^es, and threatened   to dump these on the world market at any price; if this were   done, the effect would be to destroy our export trade in   dyes; he thought it quite possible that the French would dis-   regard the damaging effect this would have on the British   industry,MR. HIRST: Ho improvement had taken place in the Electrical   Industry since he made his last report; it was still fairly   well employed on account of the recovery of business which   had taken place during the period September to March last,   but orders were now dwindling, and although it would not be   necessary to discharge hands for another four or five months,   it looked as if a bad winter-period might follow.        With regard to the Ruhr, ha agreed that a settlement   was most necessary; he considered it was not only German   credit which had to be re-established, but thought that   practically all countries had speculated in Marks, and had   thus depleted their deposits.   He would like to hear   whether the banking representatives confirmed this impression.MR. EiJlaUMOiil P&amp;aSS said that. this belief was very generally   held, and must be based largely on facts, though he could   not support it by figures.      Probably a large proportion   of the consequent losses had now been written off, and                                 -17-
                                                     iio   though these losses v/ere no doubt considerable, he did   not think that much speculation was going on now.MR. B^RIBG agreed that, generally speaking, business had   not been good during the past month.         The produce markets were uniformly depressed, and   reflected great caution on the part of buyers.   American &apos;   buying, as far as the demand for credits afforded evidence,   had fallen off during the month.  There had been no   increase in the supply of commercial bills.   Financially,   the leading features of the month had been the rise in   the rate of discount and the decline in the flew York rate   of exchange on London.   Our money market at the moment   was in an artificial condition, brought about by the   large displacements caused by the requirements of the   Clearing Banks at the end of the half-year, but the rate   of discount for 3 months bills had advanced from l%fa to        and all signs pointed to a further rise which, if it  . took place, would lessen the existing disparity between   the value of money in Hew York and London.   A further   fall in the Hew York rate of exchange was a probability   that must be reckoned with.         Hew issues of capital had found ready subscribers, but   it was open to question what proportion of the subscriptions   represented new capital seeking permanent investment.  If any   large proportion had been due to premium hunters using   borrowed money, a rise in money rates might provoke a   salutary liquidation.         The Continental exchanges, even those of countries   which were on a gold basis, had moved in the direction of   inflation.  The Mark remained under the hammer, demoralised   by forced purchases of the commodities necessary to maintain   life.  This German demoralisation affected the whole frame-   work of -coEEaoroiftl Europe, and as long as it remained
Ill    unremedied it seemed idle to look for any revival in     trade.         In addition, the following Memoranda were    received from Members unable to be present:-MR.J.W.MURRAY:IRON AND STEEL TRADE WEST OF SCOTLAND.  The Pig Iron Works    are stocking Pig Iron, and the Steel Works are not    getting nearly enough Orders to keep them going on    anything like a bulk production basis.         This&apos;Is due, no doubt, in part to the Boiler-    Makers&apos; Strike which is affecting the Shipbuilding    Industry on the Clyde, and also partly to the feeling    that prices are too high and ought to come down.         The cost of production has gone up owing to the    high price of Coal, etc: and Manufacturers state there-.    is no room, at present costs, for a reduction in.    prices of the finished articles.         At present the Trade is distinctly bad and the out-    look far from encouraging. TRADE IN THE FAR EAST.  During the past month there has    only been a small business in Textiles done in this    Country for these markets.  They are buying only in    small quantities and apparently are still under the    impression that costs on this side must come down.         In the lower classes of Cotton Goods any demand    there has been is being strongly competed for by Japan;    but, generally speaking, only a moderate business is    going through.         In some markets the reason for &quot;hand to mouth&quot;    buying is the unsatisfactory financial position of    Dealers, and there have been a good many failures
    which, of course, have a disturbing effect on business.         As to. the future, it is difficult to be    optimistic but there is no doubt that most of these    Far Eastern Markets are bare of supplies of Textiles and    in my view, when it is realized that there is not much    prospect of the price of Raw Cotton coming down, they    will have to buy in greater bulk than they have been    doing lately.         During the month there has been a pretty steady    demand for ROUGH GOODS, such as Holloware, Galvanized    Iron, Earthenware , etc;  but Dealers in these articles    seem also to be under the impression that costs on this    side are too high and, consequently, they are not buying    in any quantity for forward delivery.         Generally speaking the immediate future is uncertain    and the cry from these Eastern Markets (like many others)    is that British costs - both of Textiles and Rough Goods -    are too high.MR. SHAW  sent a message to the effect that the situation in    the cotton trade was no better, but if anything worse than    last month.         The opinion was generally expressed that a great    change had recently taken place in public opinion over the    Ruhr occupation and towards France.  There was now a great    and growing feeling among both manufacturers and work-    people that the present position was disastrous. Irritation    was also felt at the failure of the French to tax them-    selves, while they ignored their debts and were able through    the depreciation of their exchange to undersell British    manufacturers.  There was a strong desire for a definite    British policy which vould insist on and secure a    settlement.
     The following memorandum was received from Sir eric geddes. who was unable to be present     TRAPE POSITION DURING JUKE; GENERAL.  Taken as awhole the trade position during June has been disappointing.The oontlnuanoe of polltloal chaos on the Continent,coupled with bad weather conditions, seems to have oounteract-ed the few hopeful tendenoiee which began to appear earlier in the year.   There are a great number of oross currentswhioh make It a little dangerous to generalise too widely.Here and there individual firms seem to be doing fairlywell and in the case of oertain branches of industry BC-meseotions are very muoh better plaoed than are others.Nevertheless I must admit that I am muoh perturbed at thestagnant oondltion whioh Is general, for if trade is bad nowone must, I fear, anticipate that In the main It will be muohworse in the winter.  We should by now be seeing orders comingthrough if there Is to be any expansion of industry in theautumn and early winter and In the main actual orders havenot lnoreased but rather tended to fall off.  It is only possible to give a very brief blrd&apos;s-eye view of. industry Ina report of thiB nature, and I have therefore seleoted theleading industries of the oountry so far as possible anddevoted only two or three lines to eaoh In order to conveya ploture of the state of affairs.  Here and there, as I saidabove, individual firms have been fortunate and their experience may oontradiot that of the majority of the firms ina particular trade, but the Information in possession of theFederation of British Industries is of such a widespreadnature that its general conclusions may be accepted asabsolutely authoritative.
                       INDIVIDUAL TRADES. TEXTILE.      Ootton.-    Owing to larger shipments of cotton piece goods having been recorded during liay than for several previous  months,  there is an impression among the public  that these industries  are  improving; but these goods were made many  months  ago  and are explained by the  apurt in buying which took plaoe  in January but whioh has Bince subsided. As a  matter  of faot,  nearly half  the looms in Lancashire are standing idle  for want  of work and the  only end whioh is doing  well in  spinning is the finer end.   Business ia exceedingly  diffioult to  obtain and orders  are few and far between.  The Near-eastern  trade is  dead  and the prloee from  South America have been so  low  afl  to render busineBB impossible0  While export trade  is  exceedingly quiet, clear- disturbances for home trade  have been  adversely  affeoted  by unseasonable weather.  On the whole, what little business there ie is in  the goods made of Egyptian  cottons, but the American seotion is very depressed.  For  four months, production has been  out  down by 50$  and even yet producers have experienced no relief and the ourtailment will have to be continued throughout July and August in addition  to and irrespective of the Annual Holiday oloslng.    The  small amount of business there is is being done at ruinously  cut prices and the situation is very gloomy. . The orux of the question is that it is impossible to get downproduction costs  to the figure of 1914 whereas in most of  our over-seas markets consumers are poorer rather than richer.     Wool.- In.yarns business is very restricted and in orderto dispose of their goods manufacturers are obliged to sell, yarnsat prices lower than to-day&apos;s replacement  rates.  The mohairspinners are the  best  off but it is reported that the demand forthese goods in the United States, which was responsible  forthe recent prosperity  in this section of the trade, now  showsBigns of abatement,,
     Piece Q-ooda. - The outlook for piece goods is dull,at any rate for the home market.  For this the weather is mainly responsible, while the fierce competition of Frenchgoods, both In this country and in foreign markets is mostdisastrous.  Owing to their low rate of exchange and also toextremely low produotion oosts, French manufacturers are able to pay high prices for the raw wool and yet sell theirfinished products at a lower cost than we can.  In the exporttrade the best marketB appear to be South America, though there has been a slight revival In dresB goods for Canada.The demand from China and Japan has fallen off and therehas been little business doing on the Oontlnent.  Here again,export figures are somewhat misleading, as they really rep-resent the work done at the beginning of the year and notthe state of trade to-day.     Drapery. - The drapery trade is having a most trying timeand almost the only goods in real demand are coats for autumn and winter.  Artificial silk goods are doing fairly well; but,with these exceptions, all reports indicate that buyers areholding off and delaying ordering as long as possible.  the bad weather has prevented any repeat orders and at the sametime there is severe competition from foreign-made wearingapparel.     Linen. - In yarns the position remains quiet but thereis a fair demand for tow yarns.  The piece goods are alsofairly quiet, but on the whole there is a more hopefulatmosphere in this Industry than in many others.     Jute. - Jute has been doing fairly well, especially the spinners of yarns.  The cloth section is fairly quiet.Nevertheless the  Jute trade is doing better than might beexpected.
     Shipbuilding. - Here the position is most unsatisfactory and appears to be getting steadily worse even than it was amonth ago.  This is particularly the case in the North-Easternarea.  In part this is due to the lock-out of boiler-makers,in part to Continental competition, in the main to the generalimpoverishment of the world.     Wire Ropes. - While production in this industry Is below normal, nevertheless in the first four months in the year therehas been a steady increase in business, whioh tends to continue.The situation has been influenced by the extraordinary boom in trade in the United States of America, which has suoh alarge home demand that it Is unable to compete with ue in overseas markets.MISCELLANEOUS.     chemicals.  - The Chemical Trade has done fairly well and business has been reasonably steady.  The principal oause fornervousness on the part of buyers is the Continental positionand the depression in the Textile Industry which is normallyone of the biggest consumers of heavy chemicals for the home trade.     Printing.-  In the printing trade business though quietIs rather more settled than it has been for some time.  this may be regarded  as an encouraging sign.     Boots &amp; Shoes. - Conditions here remain muoh as they werelast month.  Business fluctuates considerably end what ordersthere  are, are barely sufficient to keep firms going for afew weeks at a time.  If anything, reoent reports indicate a diminution in  demand and oertainly the unseasonable weatherhas helped to increase the general atmosphere of stagnation,for it has ruined the summer business.
     Gold Rolled. Brass &amp; Copper. -   The demand this month hasbeen below expectations but is nevertheless fairly well maintain-ed, taking into consideration the uncertain economic and political conditions.  The copper market has been weak.  This has enabledmakers of cold rolled strip and sheets to reduce their prices forfinished goods.     Jewellery &amp; Electro Plate, -   The jewellery trade remainslifeless and unemployment is general among the workers in preciousstones and metals.  Slackness of demand is noticeable both athome and abroad.  The most prosperous sections of the trade arethose dealing.with silver and plated goods. &quot;In this section themost depressed area is London.  Abroad, Australia is perhaps thebest customer and India the worst.  In the main, demand is belowproduction and plant can only be kept going by sacrificing profits.     Ooal. -  In the past month there has been a distinct stabilisation-sing of prices in the coal trade.  The position varies from district to district, and the Newcastle area on the whole is doing wellowing to the demand from the Continent, particularly fromScandinavia;  but the extraordinary demand from Germany isdwindling.  Quite considerable developments are taking place incertain areas with a view to tapping new seams, opening new shaftsand so forth, which is a healthy sign.     Motor Qars &amp; Cycles. -    On the whole the motor car industry has been doing well and exports have increased.  Yet, despite this,over 10,000 motor cars have been imported into the  united kingdom during this year, nearly ten times as many as we exported,   in themain, however, firms are fairly busy, the chief business being in light cars.  The cycle trade is also doing well considering every-thing, and there is a good business in the export of pedal cycles nd parts.
     Silk &amp; Ifrnbroidery.  -  Both these trades  are  sufferingseverely, alike from the effects of the bad weather  and fromthe complicated European situation.  These industries  sufferparticularly severely from the flooding of the home  marketswith foreign produce dumped here at a price with  which it Isimpossible to compete.     Lace. -  The Lace Trade remains as much  depressed as everdespite the Herculean efforts which have been made by  the Laceindustry to create a demand for the article.   Foreign  markets havebeen lost One by one owing to the adverse rate of exchange and increased tariffs.  For example, In the United States a 90%duty has been imposed where before the revision it was 60%,and as a result the market for our goods in that  country hasbeen killed.  On the othei&quot; hand, foreign lace, particularly from France, is destroying the home demand for British lace asit is offered at prices with which we cannot  compete.METAL INDUSTRIES.   -     The latest figures for production and exports at  first sight appear encouraging, but unfortunately the production wason account of past orders, arid as these are completed manufac-turers are finding it Increasingly difficult  to replace  them.The temporary stimulus afforded by the occupation of the Ruhrhas spent Itself;  demand is exceedingly quiet and prices aresagging.  Reports indicate that many blast furnaces  which only recently have been blown in will shortly have to damp down  orgo out entirely, if new orders are not received.  The  brightestspot in  the Industry is the Tinplate trade, and in consequenceproduction in South Wales is higher than for  any previous monthsince the end of the War.     Machine T00I3. - The Machine Tools industry is  improvingslowly but steadily.  Export trade is increasing in various parts of  the&apos;British Empire but other foreign markets  are poor
     Rubber. -  The position in the rubber manufacturing industry is certainly more favourable than this time last year,but business is very hard to get.  There is a fair trade in motortyres and though demand is not so big for cycle tyres, there isa limited demand for solid tyres.  In mechanicals there is afair all-round trade and the prices are low.  In surgicalsections there is bitter complaint of the fierce competit action of  Germany and Italy, and on the whole prices are tending upwardsowing to the increased price of raw rubber, and this is a cause for some anxiety.     Pottery. -  In the main things are better and buyers are showing more confidence than hitherto.  There is quite a gooddemand for seconds and cheaper wares, also for medium grade wares.     Hardware and Cutlery. -  Trade is very patchy and businesshard to get, but there are still a fair number of orders coming  -through, and the reduction in the price of tools by 5$ and reductions in the galvanized hollow-ware trade, it is anticipated,will lead to inoreased business.  At the moment the razor tradeis hardest hit but Sheffield firms are getting quite goodbusiness in scissors and pocket knives, although the prioesare very finely cut.
