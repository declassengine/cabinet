DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT).                       CABIN EJ.                         I  C         ANGLO-FRENCH RELATIONS AND GERMAN REPARATION ETC.         SUGGESTIONS BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNION         OF SOUTH AFRICA AS TO BRITISH EMPIRE POLICY.      Telegram from the Governor General of the Union of South      Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.                        dated 7th July, 19S3.      (Received Colonial Office 10.33 p.m. 7th July, 1923)            (Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister).       July 7th.  Secret.       Following from ^rime Minister for your Prime MinisterBegins;:-       Your telegram Sth July reporting conversations between lord Curzon and French and Belgian Ambassadors.  I approve ofLord Curzon&apos;s  solemn warnings to French and Belgian Governments.Looking at  developments as a whole in our  relations with Francesince Peace Conference I feel a crisis is  not very far off andBritish Government will soon have to choose between maintenanceof Entente  on the one hand and maintenance of British self-respect and honour  and Empire prestige as a  first  class Power on the other.French answer  to British interrogatories whether in writing or notis certain  to  be  unsatisfactory as French  are in Ruhr not so muchwith the object of recovering reparations  as of maintaining astrangle-hold  on Germany&apos;s vital artery until she collapses andall future  danger to France disappears by  dissolution of Germany.       Whatever the form of their answer French will be  determined to maintain hold.    This is the position we shall have to face.318,(23),,.
However  sincere  our desire for allied solidarity in the  present world crisis,  still we  have  to face  realities  and recognise  that french policy is  driving Europe on  rocks and that a very solemn       Jduty on  the  part of the British  Empire arises  in that respect.The  time has  therefore  come  to explore the possibilities nf  thenew situation with which we  may  soon be faced.   Prom that appointed                                                                       I,of view  I  venture io make  the following 5 suggestions.       (1)  Whatever happens-we  should avoid all recognition oracquiescence  in  Ruhr occupation.   We have fortunately dissociatedourselves  in  advance from  this fruitful source of future Europeantroubles.       (2)   Should French  persist in their unsatisfactory attitudewe should  then solemnly renounce  Entente in a  formal document givingour  reasons and  basing  them  on the highest human grounds.    Itshould be  an  appeal to  the conscience of the world and reaffirm theideals for which the  allied  peoples  made great sacrifices  in the war.It should  isolate France morally and rally public opinion to the side of the British Empire-    It also notifies our retirement fromSeparation Commission on which our position latterly has beenambiguous.    The British Government  should obtain concurrence ofDominion Governments and documents should speak for Empire as a whole.       (3)   Having finished  with the Entente and recovered our.freedom  of action the British Government should then proceed toconfer with Germany on  their latest  offer ;and  to accept the  offer of an impartial  International Commission to consider and fixGermany&apos;s  capacity to pay.    The British Government should getItaly and  Japan  to join in this  stepo   France should be alsoinvited and if she declines  to  join should be left out of Commission.!Belgium should be treated  in the same way.  I  consider it mostadvisable  that the Commission should also be empowered to  adviseQn the proper treatment of inter-allied indebtedness.   Such a  step would morally immensely strengthen the position of the British
Government.  The Commission  should be  as  strong as possible  and united States  of America  should be pressed to appoint a member.On this ground as  well as to prevent France from attempting  towreck the  League of  Nations  there  should  be no reference of  thematter to  the  League.       (4)   Simultaneously with reply  to  Germany the BritishGovernment  should  make separate peace  with Turkey if allied  peacehas not been concluded before.   I thoroughly approved LordCursor,1 s refusal at  Lausanne to consider  a separate peace.    Butobjection  to it will disappear  with  the Entente and a Britishpeace will have a  great effect  on Mohammedan world.       (5)   The German debt  having been determined by theCommission  it  should then be allocated amongst the late allies in the proportion  agreed  upon three  years ago.  With regard  to the portion allocated  to the  British Empire  I am inclined to flavourpayment by arrangement with  Germany  whereby a portion of the Englishpublic war debt is transferred  to Germany, the English creditorsbeing protected by a British guarantee.   If the other Allies should follow a similar course reparation question will be settled  exceptso far as.  France and Belgium are concerned.   My feeling is  thatwhen France  sees the wprld moving  on without her she may repentof her isolation and a successor to  Poincare may be found willingto accept  our  solution.  In  any case if France hardens her heartno other course will be left but to  go on without her and she maybefore long  be glad  to fall  into line  in  order to escape from the by that time impossible Ruhr position.       The  course  I  suggest  means a  determined attempt to end the reparations  trouble  once  and for all so far as we are concerned.Jt also means  the  British Empire resumes  the leadership which hastemporarily passed away from her.    It will not mean hostility to france ;  it  need not involve any serious  breach with her.
       I trust  these  suggestions will be  carefully consideredby you and Lord Curzon in the light of  much fuller knowledgeof the facts  which you possess.    The  crisis  which I  fear will soon be upon  us should find us ready*and  prepared to  act with full courage  and decision not only in  the interests of  theBritish Empire  but of Europe and  civilisation which is  rapidlycrumbling away.   Ends.                                      ARTHUR FREDERICK.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1.    July 11th,  1923.
