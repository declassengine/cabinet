Comaunist officials  are  devoting most of their time topreparation for  the  autumn  propaganda oarapaign arid less surfaoeaotivity is in consequence  apparent.    A quantity  of oommunist  literature, brought  to thisoountry by the Russian ship &quot;Koranunist&quot; has been  seised by thepolice at West Hartlepool.    Tho activities  of the  British Bureau  of the  RedInternational of Labour Unions are increasing.    &quot;The Dully  Herald&quot; expeots to have to cease  publication0&quot;ing to financial difficulties:   the Communist Party  iswixlous that the paper should -be saved, to beoome &quot;a real.labour Daily, under  the control of a democratically electedoo&amp;tnittee of the whole movement.&quot;
THE COMMUNISTS          The  Executive Committee of the Communist Party is     appealing for  1,000 to cover the expenses of the autumn     propaganda campaign:  individual communists have  been asked     to collect  10.    The Executive Committee intends to follow    - the demonstrations with a campaign inside trade union     branches  and  to  distribute quantities of literature dealing     with the  party&apos;s programme and  policy.          The  Communist Party is trying to arrange a series  of     debates,  in various important towns,  with the Industrial     league  and Council for Employers and  workers:  at present     negotiations are in progress for fixtures in London,     Birmingham,  Glasgow, Liverpool  and Manchester,  Wherever     possible  the  debates are to be  broadcasted as was the case     with the  speeches made by Sir Ernest  Benn and J. T. Walton     Be^boia,  M.P., at the King sway  Hall last winter.    Efforts     are being made to secure the   Pree  Trade Hall, Manchester, on     October 5th,  a hall at Birmingham on Ootohor Oth  and 11th and     St.  Andrew&apos;s Halls,  Glasgow,  on December 7th,          A  final  syllabus for Communist Party training groups     is at present under the consideration of the Central     Saseutive and is ejected to be ready for groups  in October:     Tom Bell  will probably take over this phase tff party work.          The  Printed and Allied Trades Groups Committee of  the     Communist Party  considers it &quot;highly  desirable  to strengthen     at the  present time  the Communist Party nucleus within  the     National  Union of Journalists&quot;:  certain communists who are     now members of the national Union of  Clerks,  including     R. Palme  Dutt, have  accordingly been  instructed to transfer   .  to the  National  Union of Journalists.                                                         The/
     The Coramunist Party has taken up the question of   o!5the arrests of communlsts in Finland, which it terms the&quot;Finnish White Terror&quot; and &quot;Persecution of the FinnishLabour Party&quot;:   District Party Committees and unattachedlocals have been instructed to pass &quot;suitable resolutions&quot; andco send copies to the Foreign Offioe and the FinnishLegation.   The question is to be raised by oommunists atpolitical meetings and to be dealt with from communistplatforms.     It is reported that at an aggregate meeting of theWest London Croups of the Communist party held on August17th, the whole time of the meeting was devoted to thediscussion of the  situation in Germany:  a communication from headquarters was read in which the communists presentwere requested to  &quot;consider England in a similar chaoticcondition to that  existing in Germany;  to consider thestate of the exchanges, a depreciating pound, soaring&apos;prices,  scarcity of food, etc., in that event;  and whatwould be members1  duty as communists?&quot;   Speakerssubsequently dealt with the means of securing &quot;firearms,control of gas, electricity, tubes, trams, &quot;buses, etc.&quot;and &quot;above all&quot; with methods of &quot;mastering the police&quot;.     The following extract from a letter recently written  bythe national organising secretary to the south Wales DistrictParty Committee indicates the extent to vhich details of communist machinery in Great Britain were discussed at thelast Moscow conference!          &quot;The question of transferring the south Wales     District Industrial Committee from Cardiff to     Porth was considered at the meeting of the central     executive oommittee held last evening.  In view of     certain changes that are necessitated as a result of     the recent conference between the central executive     committee and the Presidium of the Comintern in     Moscow, it was felt that it would be better to defer
ml... 3    . a decision&apos;of this matter until we have an opportunity     of discussing the matter with you at the meeting of     the Party Council next week-end.&quot;     The Chief Constable of Dundee informs me thatBasil Taylor stated at a meeting held in Dundee on August19th that he was forming an &quot;Anti-Parliamentarian&quot;communist group in Dundee and that he had been the means forming a similar group in Edinburgh, where he edited and published a newspaper entitled &quot;Dawn&quot;.     Sylvia pankhurst has been invited to attend thethird conference of the workers (Fourth) International whichis to be h?;ld in Germany at the end of September..TOE  BED  INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR  UNI0H3          The  &quot;International Propaganda  Oom,ifcfcoe  of     ^evolutionary iiiners&quot;hae  forwarded  to  national  sections     the  following recommendations for the  establishment  of     &quot;a brotherhood  of miners  on a national  and  an international     scale&quot;:                  &quot;The Brotherhoods  on  a national scale:         &quot; Their tasks:.   Union of miners of all  hues,  and&apos;          creation of&apos; united front for defending the working          olass&apos;  interests, sad  for leading the  struggle          against fascism end  war.         -Execution:    Public  general gatherings are to be held          xn aTl  mines and  collieries by the  shop  committees  or          by the  revolutionary organisations  in  question,  in          which brotherhood committees will  be elected out of the          representatives of Miners&apos;  organisations of  all          persuasions or that  will unite all  organisations extant          in the  mines in the  brotherhood committees,  and will          carry out  the common tasks.                  &quot;Brotherhood  on an international  scale:         &quot;Their tasks:    To strengthen and  to extend the          inlerriational connections,  to  revolutionise  the works          and  districts by exterior influences.          Execution:    Following the  decision of the mine or          pit  general meeting, the extant brotherhood  committee          or the  revolutionary miners1 organisations will          communicate with the foreign brother organisations.          The  communication must have its issue  in the nucleus          of the  works,  i.e. in  the mines and pits, and must          later on embrace the upper  instances of  labour  unions,
     as sub-distriots and districts.          &quot;At the outset, the communications may he  confined     to a  correspondence for information on the position of     miners, on conditions of the  fight, and on the     organisations1  structure. . The relations  should  further     comprise material support in  case  of  strikes, lock-outs,     etc., one mine  thereby supporting  another, and  one     district another.  A further  stage on the -way to     strengthening the international brotherhoods is the     mutual  exchange of functionaries for  studying foreign     conditions and  methods, ancl for keeping up lively     communications.&quot;     On August 7th the &quot;International propaganda Committeeof  Commercial and Office Employees&quot; sent the followingsecret circular to the British Bureau of the Red Internationalof  Labour  Unions!          &quot;The Presidium Of the International  Propaganda     Committee of Commercial and Office Employees, decided     at its  meeting  of July 6th, 1923,  to  call the second     International Conference of revolutionary unions and     minorities of offioe employees at  Vienna  in December     19B3U   The exact date of the  cohferenoe will be given     in the  future communications.          &quot;The agenda of the International Conference Is as     follows:     1.

The All-Russian Union  of Office  Employees     shall be entitled to two decisive  votes.   Wherever     possible, tho cost  of sending delegates shall be defrayed                                                        &quot;by/
&quot;by the organisations represented.     &quot;The number of delegates with consultative votes isnot limited.  All the expenses of the delegates withconsultative votes must be borne by the organisationssending them.     &quot;It is requested that all available data on theeoonomio situation and legal status of the following catergories of officials and employees should besubmitted to the Secretariat of the I.P. C. by November10th:(a)   Government officials discharging functions of    . management, control, law enforcement, finance,      taxation, control of industry and national      economic, and government trade.(b)   of military and ad ministrative institutions.(o)   of consumers&apos; co-operatives.(d)   of credit, banking and insurance institutions.(e)   of private trade.(f)   of public institutions.&quot;m THIRD INTERHATIONAX AMD THE DOCKERS         The  following is a copy of a document  recently received    which illustrates the interest taken by the Third    International  in labour unrest in Great Britain:              &quot;The Exeoutive Committee of the Third  International         oannot  pass over in silence the unpardonable  way in which         a great opportunity me allowed to slip by  the Western         European  Propaganda Secretariat in the case of the         Bookers&apos;  strike  in England.  The perusal of the  Strike         Committee&apos;8 report has, produced on the members of the         Executive Committee the most unfavourable impression.  It         has  once  more proved that the subordinate sections of         the  Executive Committee are still a long way  from attaln-         ing  the ideal proletariat organisatio/i formulated, by         the  Third and Fourth International Congresses.              &quot;After this experience neither the sections nor         indeed  the Executive Committee itself  can be  regarded         as up to  standard or as capable of coping with the         difficulties of  the present position.              &quot;To  lay all the responsibility for the arranging of         transport strikes on the shoulders of  the inexperienced         and  as  yet immature English Communist  party was the         action  of experts who are very inexpert in the         performance of their duties.   In no oase should  the         responsible members of a section of the Third  Inter-         national  have been chosen from among the members of such
an inexperienced party.  The Western EuropeanPropaganda Secretariat did just what it ought not tohave done and thoroughly deserves the epithet1 thoughtless experts&apos; conferred upon it.  The result oftheir action was only what might have been expected.     &quot;The failure of the Dockers&apos; Strike--a strike onthe organisation of which so much trouble and money hadbeen expended---not only by the CommTinist party inEngland but also by the Executive Committee of theThird International, was due only to the thoughtlesstactics pursued by the Secretariat.     &quot;It was a serious mistake so grossly to over-estimate the situation in Germany and thus miss thepossibility of developing the revolutionary movementin England.  The Secretariat could not but be aware of the point of view of the Executive Committee inrelation to German affairs and of the entire dependence of the latter on the international situation.  Only thejoint efforts of all the sensible proletarians ofEurope and especially those of England, the mostconservative and inert, but, at the ssme time, the mostunited and best organised of all oentres, can rendereasier the position of the German proletariat,  in preparing a strike in England the Third Internationalhad in mind far bigger&apos;things than the Secretariatimagined.  The Secretariat through ats culpableinactivity not only placed our English comrades in avery difficult position but also entirely dostroyed the strategic plan of the Third International.     &quot;Comrade Brsndlar&apos;s brief explanation of the matterwill not hold water, seeing that his reference to the so-called authoritative directions reoeived from ComradeRadek loses its significance when read in the light ofthe instructions issued by the Executive Committee onJuly 4th.  Besides this Comrade Radek&apos;s mandate doesnot empower him to alter or correct the strategicalplans of the Executive Committee, a fact of whichComrades Brandler. price and in a still greaterdegree, Comrade Wolffstein, had been duly informed.The Executive Committee is greatly surprised at ComradeBrandler&apos;s argximent^  He sesms to consider the secretariat as entitled to explain, correct and supplementall orders issued by the higher organs of the ThirdInternational Executive Committee which is responsibleonly to the Plenum and the Congress.     &quot;Even though the facts just referred to are unlikely to occur again, the Executive Committee of theThird International nevertheless insists on the mostabsolute and precise fulfilment of all its orders and instructions by the sections, departments and differentgroups, no matter whether the latter possess autonomy ornot.     &quot;The organising seotion of the Executive Committeewill furnish all departments, divisions and sectionswith all necessary instructions.&quot;SEIZURE/

The Chief Constable of Durham informs me that,  aoting     urpoa Information received from the preveutative Officer at     West Hartlepool, he has caused to be seized some half owt.     of oommuniat literature which was found in a bag, under seal,     in the oabin of the bolshevik ship &quot;Kommunist&quot;, which     arrived at West Hartlepool. on August 18th.          The following is a list of the literature seized which     appears to have been intended for circulation in this     country, in view of the fact that all the books were in     English:                                                         Ho. of             game of work                      Cop lea&quot;The Communist International&quot;................    17&quot;The First Congress of the Toilers of            the Far 3ast&quot;..................*.     8&quot;The Red Labour Union International&quot;....,....    46&quot;The Bulletin of the Executive Committee of            the Communist International......    38&quot;Programme of the Russian Communist Party.

Young will explain to members of    the Communist Party and of the League the decisions    reached at the Fourth Bureau Session of the Young    Communist International recently held in Moscow.         Young appears to be visiting Aberdeen before going    to Glasgow, which he reaches on September 3rd, and where    he. will endeavour to get into touch with ship-building    apprentices with a view to exploiting their grievances    regarding wage reductions.m UNEMPLOYED         The National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement    opened its winter campaign on unemployment under somewhat    inauspicious circumstances at Trafalgar Square on August    26th:  the audience numbered between 200-fOO people only:    speeches were made by W. Hannington, II.  Homer and H.    Martin, who, however,  had nothing new to say.         Tho General Council of the Trade Union Congress haB    agreed to receive a deputation of not more than three    members of the National Committee of the organised    unemployed and to give them &quot;half-an-hour of Congress    time&quot; at next week&apos;s meeting at Plymouth.

          Tho  Chief  Constable  of  Barrow informs me  that Horace     B.  Newbold  has  left  that  borough for the  purpose  of     organising  unemployed  coimiittees in different  centres:     his initial efforts  are to be  at Lancaster  and Preston.          The  South  West  of Scotland District  Council  of  the     National  Unemployed  workers&quot; Committee Movement claims  that     its membership  is increasing slightly: propaganda     campaigns have  been  arranged for the White vale, Govan and     Motherwell  districts.IRISH KBVOBJTIQgalff  ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIN          The  new  Republican League,  referred  to  in the last     two  reports,  is coming out rather strongly.  Its  founders,     a small group of young men,  self-styled ex-communists having     some  Irish  connections, hold meetings three  times weekly in     Hyde  Park and make speeches  chiefly remarkable for their     violence  and  lack of knowledge  of current events.  The     principals  are  J.D.  Wilkinson,  Michael Bull, 0&apos;Loary and    &apos; Fitssge raid.          In public  they  affect a good  deal of secrecy,     introducing their speakers as  &quot;Mr.  Blank&quot;, etc.,  but  none     of  them are of  any real importance.   The  danger is that     as  they appeal  to an ignorant class of young men  and  women,     and are increasing their  following,  the Irish  Republican     Army  leaders  may make  use of them.   Wilkinson,  the organising     secretary,  admitted  last  week that  their*organisation had     not  yet been  officially recognised  by Sinn Fein,  but  added     that  it was only a matter of time  as they were already in     coianunication with the Dublin Headquarters.          A rather sinister development has been  the issue of     application forms to would-be members, each  one being     numbered  and  a  record  kept of the person  to whom  it  is                                                       issued/
issued, showing that they intend to exercise great care in admitting servants or ex-servants of the Crown, and require an oath to Support and defend the irish republic&quot; from all members of the league whioh, by theway, has changed its name from the &quot;London IrishLeague&quot; to that of the &quot;Irish Republican League ofSreat Britain&quot;.   The form of oath is that adoptedb.v the members of the 1st Bail Bireann with an addedpledge of secrecy.   A careful watch is being kepton the antics of these young men and the question ofa prosecution under the Unlawful oaths Act is beingconsidered.     The offioial organisations in England, consistingof Irish Self-Be termination League Branches and SinnFein clubs are doing very little for the moment, butit is quite clear fihe I.R.A. leaders here arere-organising and preparing for renewed activity afterthe result of the General Election in Ireland is known.
