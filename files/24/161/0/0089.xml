389   (2i))*l SSOMmiQ,,KSL.SAmir.(August loth).        MEMORANDUM               byTHE SECRETARY&apos;OF STATE&apos; FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.I     CROWN LflASES IN BRITISH CONCUSSIONS Iff CHINA,.     The British residential concessions in China areareas of land in Treaty Ports leased in perpetuity for the convenience of British traders and residents by HisMajesty&apos;s Government from the Chinese Government in returnfor a small ground rent,  usually the equivalent of the landtax formerly levied by the Chinese Government&apos;.    Leases inthese areas have been granted by the Office of  Works on terms which have hitherto provided no substantial financialbenefit for His Majesty&apos;s Governments   The Office of Worksnow propose to offer the lot-holders the alternatives of(a) continuing to pay the present rate without  anysecurity for the renewal of the present leases  on theirexpiration, or (b) renewing the lease forthwith for afurther 999 years at an increased rent, based on thepresent building value of the land.     Under the latter alternative His Majesty1^ Governmentwould profit by about  40,000 a year.   But the Questionof the Crown Leases is Intimately connected with the muchgreater question of exterritoriality in China,     The exterritorial system, which in present circum-stances is the only satisfactory safeguard for  the tradeand residence of foreigners in China, has been  severelymenaced during the last ten years.   The war has                                            diminished
diminished the prestige of all the European Powers.Germany and Austria have lost, by Treaty, their ex-territorial privileges,   The Chinese Government havetaken over administration of the Russian concessions;and there are now 300,000 Russians in China entirelyunder Chinese jurisdiction,  whose plight is one of the strongest proofs that the maintenance of exterritorlal-ity is essential to the safety of foreign-lives and property.   The Chinese have been encouraged by theseevents!,  and also by the Washington Conference, to look forward in the near future to a withdrawal of all foreign exterritorial privileges, and the surrender ofajj. foreign concessions,,   Events in the Near East andthe demands of the Turks for the abolition of thecapitulations have further strengthened the Chinese intheir determination to recover full sovereign rights in their own country,,     The situation, therefore, has entirely changed since the proposal regarding the revaluation of theCrown Leases was first made;  for until the war, theexterritorial system remained practically unchallenged.It is owing to this change that the matter must now be viewed in the light of its political implications, andnot merely as a technical question of legal rights,though on grounds of law and equity the British lot-holders have submitted a strong protest against any increase in the present valuation of the leases.     But&apos;it is upon the broader lines of principle and policy that I consider the revaluation scheme should be                                         abandoned.
abandoned.   Its effect would be to exploit for thebenefit of our exchequer an exterritorial privilegegranted to our people by China under treaty and toestablish a claim which no other Power in China liasever attempted to exercise, and which we ourselveshave not exercised under similar circumstances either in Japan or Korea&quot;, or, so far as is known, in anyother part of the world.     Our action, which will arouse criticism amongBritish subjects in China, and among the nationals ofother foreign Powers, will provide permanent material for hostile propaganda by and amongst the Chinese,Only recently it has been decided to remit our shareof the Boxer Indemnity - a sum of about  400,000 a yeafor the next 22 years - in order that it might not besaid that Great Britain still continues to exact a payment v/hich Germany, Austria, Russia, United States ofAmerica, Prance and Japan, whether compulsorily orvoluntarily, have either renounced entirely or have applied to purposes beneficial to the Chinese.   Is it worth while for the sake of gaining  40,000 a year tofollow up a good Impression by the creation of a newcause for grievance?     A letter on the  question from Sir John Jordan is annexed to this memorandum.,             (Signed)     CURZON OP KEDLESTON,Foreign Office,     July, 1923.                                          ANNEX
(Extract from a private letter from Sir John  Jordan,               dated &quot;December 7th,  1922.)      &quot;..... ....... I have .......  putdown very briefly in writing my objection to the schemefor the  renewal of Concession Leases from tho point  of viewof present political conditions in China.      &quot;My views on the general question have been so fullyrecorded in past years as to make it unnecessary torecapitulate them here.  They are in the main in agreementwith those expressed yesterday by the two representativesof the Concession Leaseholders.      &quot;I gathered that the representatives of the Officeof Works and the Treasury do not consider the question ofpolicy as coming within their province, and it is on that point alone that I wish to lay stress at present.      &quot;For over seventy years all Powers having Treaty-relations with China remained in the undisturbed enjoyment of exterritorial rights.  Quite recently,  this situation has undergone a fundamental change,  the importance ofwhich we are not yet in a position fully to estimate.The Great War and the collapse of Russia have had theirrepercussions in China, as elsewhere.  During the war we did our utmost to extinguish enemy interests in Chinaand exercised strong pressure on the Chinese governmentto enter into possession of enemy property and to deport                                            enemy
enemy subjects,  This policy received formal con-formation in the Treaty of Versailles which abrogatedthe Leases of German Concessions and led to Germansbeing deprived of all exterritorial rights.  Austrlansshared the same fate,      &quot;Russia had enjoyed exterritorial rights and privileges since 1689 and had been the most drasticupholder of the whole exterritorial regime.  There arenow some 300,000 Russians in China entirely underChinese jurisdiction and the Soviet government has open-ly proclaimed that it has no Intention of reviving any claim to exterritorial treatment,  Indeed, one of itsablest and most unscrupulous Agents, Joffe, is now beingfeted by Peking officialdom and is offering to surrender to China all the numerous rights and concessions grantedto Russia under the Czarist regime.  It may be remarked,in parenthesis, that this might seriously affect us inChinese Turkestan where our position rests largely .upon Russian Treaties.      &quot;It may be asked, as it was in effect askedyesterday, what has all this to do with the questionof Concession Leases?  To me it seems to have a close connection and to point an obvious morale      &quot;Russia, Germany, Austria and all the new Statescreated by the Treaty of Versailles no longer enjoyexterritoriality in China.  Encouraged by all these developments and by the results of the washington conference, there is now a very serious movementgoing on in China for the curtailment, if not the total                                         abolition,
abolition, of Exterritorial privileges.  This movementwill,  of course, receive the support of our lateenemies and of the Russians, and our proposed actionin the matter of Concessions will, in my opinion, puta very effective propaganda weapon,in their hands.      &quot;We opened China to the trade of the world and ithas been our proud tradition that we claim no rights or privileges for ourselves which we do not share with the nationals of other Powers.  We. now propose to exploit forour national benefit an exterritorial provilege grantedto our people by China under Treaty and to establish a claim which no other Power in China has ever attempted to exercise, and which we ourselves have not exercised,under similar circumstances either in Japan or Corea, or, so far as I know&apos;, in any other part of the world.-What will be the effect on China and on Chinese public,opinion, which Is keenly alive to all these questions?During all these 70 years China has received a merelynegligible sum in copper cash as ground rent for these concessions, and if we convert them into a source ofrevenue for our national exchequer, it would not besurprising if the result were to stimulate the agitation for the recovery of such valuable rights.      &quot;What will be the effect on other Powers whosenationals now hold, or may desire hereafter to hold,land in our Concessions?  Our people obtain perpetualleases in the Concessions of all other Powers in China,subject to payment of Chinese ground rent, while their nationals in our Concessions will, in addition to groundrent,. presumably have to pay a heavy additional impost&apos;                                               to
Since                     WV:   .Mto the British Government.  This is hardly the reciprocaltreatment which forms the bond of good relations betweenthe Powers In China.   A case in point is that of Americaat Tientsin. - America, like all other Powers exceptourselves, granted perpetual leases in her Concessionthere and afterwards  agreed to its imcorporation in theBritish area.  The United States are already rather soreabout $hat -they regard as the exclusion of their people from some British Soncessions, and they are not likely,I fear, to appreciate this fresh form of discrimination,      &quot;We have Immense interests in China which can only,in my opinion, be adequately safeguarded by the ex-territorial system and I venture to deprecate any step which may, however remotely, militate against the con-tinuance of that system.  A wide breach has already beenmade in that structure and it may require all our efforts to prevent it from being still further widened.The present is, therefore, a singularly Inopportunemoment to exploit an  exterritorial privilege of anaccidental nature and&apos; a policy of ouieta npn mover!seems to be dictated  by all the circumstances.      &quot;If it is merely a question of obtainingadditional revenue, there are, as I have often ln-dicated, other means  of attaining this without dis-criminatlng against any particular section of theBritish communities in China&quot;.
                        s.                      682     Since the preparation of the above statement Ihave received a copy of the memorandum by the Finan-cial Secretary to the Treasury on this subject, onwhich I wish to make the following comments:-     1.   The assertion is made in paragraph 4 that&quot;the virtual free gift to a few interests in China of&quot;999 years leases of property worth  6,000,000 seems&quot;absolutely indefensible.&quot;   As regards the figure of 6,000,000 it should be pointed out that the schemefor the renewal of the leases supported by the Treasuryis only calculated to produce  40,000 a year whichcapitalized represents something under  1,000,000, sothat if the present reversionary value were indeed 6,000,000, the Treasury would, on their own showing,have already themselves given away  5,000,000 and forno reason, whilst objecting to the remission of 1,000,000 which is desired by the Foreign Office forthe political reasons set out above,     In point of fact, however, the figure  6,000,000is entirely fallacious.   Even if it represents the truevalue of the property were it sold in the open market to-day - and there is reason to believe that it isexaggerated - it must be remembered tfhat some 37 or 38years of the leases remain unexpired.   The present dayvalue on a 5% discount basis is somewhere in theneighbourhood of  1,000,000,  and that is,  of course,the true value of the property.   It is,  therefore, mis-leading to speak of a gift of  6,000,000.     2. -  The statement in paragraph 6 that the ForeignOffice &quot;no longer attempt to maintain&quot; the argumentsused during the discussions in the years preceding thewar is possibly an attempt to show that they have                                        shifted .....
shifted their ground and are prejudiced.   The facts are that from 1912 onwards -.the time when the questionof the crown leases was first brought up - the british representatives in China have been consistently opposedto the Office of Works and Treasury policy.   TheForeign Offive on the other hand did not feel justifiedin maintaining that opposition on the purely legal andeconomic merits of the case as against the expertopinion of those two Departments.   The result was a compromise confirmed as recently as March 1922.   Itwas not my intention to recede from this position had it not been for the fact that in the meantime thepolitical aspect, which had become immensely moreimportant as the result of the war, was very cogentlybrought to my notice by sir J. Jordan, formerly HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Peking.   It is this which hasnow induced me to urge.that the political factor mustbe the governing one, and not a desire to upset the compromise agreed upon which was based on the economicmerits of the case.     3.   The reference to the Tientsin barracks inparagraph 6 would lead one to suppose that this was acase of a leaseholder exploiting the value of a crownlot.   As a matter of fact the barracks are situatedoutside the British concession and have nothing to do with Crown lease property.    But if they had,  it wouldnot affect rry point which is not that the mercantilecommunity should be prevented from exploiting the con-cessions, which indeed were intended for business pur-poses, but that it is impolitic for His Majesty ,;sGovernment to use them for raising a revenue,  which the                                           Chinese ....
Chinese government might well feel that they them-selves, if anyone, were entitled to.     4.   As regards the extra-territorial positionreferred to in paragraph 6, the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury would seem to argue that this dependssolely on what was agreed at Washington.   He appearsto ignore, however, the growth of public opinion onthe subject in China itself, which is more clearlybrought out in my memorandum above and in Sir JohnJordan&apos;s letter annexed thereto.     5.   As to the parliamentary aspect of the q.ues-tlon referred to in paragraph 8 it may be pointed outthat in the case of the remission of the Boxer indemnity-nity via:   about  11,000,000 nominal payable by annualinstalments of about  400,000 making the present valueprobably between  4 and  5,000,000, I was told by theTreasury that parliamentary sanction was not needed in the case of unconditional remission.   As a matterof fact we are seeking parliamentary sanction because we are not remitting unconditionally, but propose touse the funds for educational and other purposesmutually beneficial to China and ourselves.   That isto say, we are asking for sanction-to the diversion of the funds from one purpose to another but not forremission.   No parliamentary sanction was needed in tha case of a total.and unconditional surrender ofinstalments, of. some  400,000 which were by Act ofParliament already earmarked for.the redemption of debt and had actually been received up to 1917 (whenthe payments were suspended for 5 years in recognitionof China&apos;s entry into the war).   Why then should it                                             be ...
SS5 be necessary&apos; in the case of the  surrender, of  40,000 which is  only prospective?      5.    The Treasury &quot;memorandum finally states that the &quot;transaction would certainly be brought to light  &apos;&quot;at the Public Accounts Committee and the Government&quot;would be  open to the most damaging criticism.&quot; Unless the Financial Secretary proposes himself to call the  attention of the Committee to the subject, it is not clear to me how a prospective rental due 37 years hence is likely to come up for discussion before that Body.
