REPORT,1,   The Committee was appointed on 28th December, 1922,with the following Terms of Reference       (a), To oonsider and Report upon tho work of            the Historical Seotion of the Committee            of Imperial Defence:(b)  To make recommendations as to the con-     tinuance or otherwise of the Official     Histories of the War:.(o)  Subject to a recommendation, to continue     the Official Histories,  to consider, in     Consultation with the Heads of tho     Departments concerned, the selection of     authors to fill any vacancies:(d)  To consider the question of publishing     certain sections of the History of the     Ministry of Munitions.JOMMITTEEICOHTROLIS THEICIALloam.2,   During the enquiry by the Committee into the working ofthe Historical Section of the Committee cf Imperial Defenceit was pointed out that questions were liable to arise fromtime to time with regard to the Official Histories on whichit was desirable for the Secretary to the Committee of ImperialDefence to obtain the ruling of a responsible Minister.   TheCommittee which had been appointed in the past for this purposeia no longer able to discharge the requisite functions,     The Committee recommend that a permanent Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of imperial Defence should be appointed to control the Official Histories, the membership of which to be a cabinet minister as Chairman, with representatives from the Treasury,
            Admiralty,  War Office,  Air Ministry and the Seoretary to            tho Committee of Imperial Defence as members. E PRE PAR-   3,   The Committee are  satisfied that the Official ION OF THE  Histories fulfil a useful purpose and that their FECIAL      preparation should be continued.   Several of  these STORIES.            histories,  in particular the histories of the  Military            campaigns,  are required for the education and  instruction            of officers and consequently their preparation should not            be unduly delayed.                 With this object in view the Committee are of the            opinion that additional historians should be appointed to            undertake at once the preparation of the histories of the            Western Front, 1918, Palestine and Gallipoli campaigns.            General Edmonds, the present Military Historian, should            continue&apos;the completion of the History of the  Western            Eront up to 1918, a work which will of necessity occupy            him for a considerable time,SELECTION OF  4,   Considerable difficulty has been experienced by theADDITIONALHISTORIANS.   Committee in selecting historians for these histories,            The Committee, after consultation with the Secretary of            State for far and the First Lord of the Admiralty as regards            the Military and Naval histories respectively, advise that            the following gentlemen should be invited to undertake the            work of writing the histories  :-                History of the               Sir Henry Newbolt as                Naval Operations:            successor to  the late                                             Sir Julian Corbett.                History of the               Lieut,General Sir L.E*                Western *ront, 1918:         kiggel, K.C.B., E.C.M.G.                History of the               Major General Sir G.F,                Palestine Campaign:          MacMunn, K.C.B., K.C.S.I,,                                             D.S.O., on the terminatlon                                             of his oresent appointment                                             es Q..M.O, in India.

mSALARIES OF  5*    The Committee consider that  a sum of  , 800 per  annumHISTORIANS.            should, as a general rule,  he sufficient remuneration to            the officers selected as historians,  if thsy are  also in            receipt of half or retired  pay.    It  is understood,            however, that under the regulations a reduction of  10$            would he necessary in the amount  to he paid to officers  on            the active list in receipt  of half pay.   The employment            of  officers on half pay oh  these  terms would he subject            to  special Treasury and War Office sanction.                 In view of the high qualifications possessed hy Sir            Henry Newbolt, who is suggested as Successor to the late            Sir Julian Corbett, the Committee recommend that  he should            receive  1,000 per annum.THE HJBLICA- 6.    The advisability of ensuring that the cost of  the OF THEOFFICIAL     Of ficial -Histories , particularly  those required for theHISTORIES.            education and training of officers, should be as  low as            possible has been impressed on the Committee, and in            consequence the possibilities in  this direction have been            thoroughly explored.                 The Committee are of the opinion that this object            will be best assured if H.M. Stationery Office undertake            in  the future the publication and sale of  the Histories            of  Military Operations, provided  this can  be arranged            without the payment of large sums by  H.M.  Government as            compensation to the firms of Publishers with whom contract            are in existence at present.                 The remaining histories, i.e., the History of  the            Air Operations, Sea-borne Trade,  Tie  Merchant Navy  in the            War, and The Naval Operations, differ from.the MilatscFy            Histories in that they are  not in the nature of text            books, and are also, in several cases, in  an advanced            state of completion.   The  Committee  therefore recommend            that the production of these histories should be  left            with the publishing firms.
A HI STORY OS&quot;    7-  An Interim Report, (CP. 66 (23)), on the question-THE MINISTRY OP MJHITIGNS. of the publication of the History of the Ministry of              Munitions was submitted to the Cabinet on l8th              February, 1923, and, for convenience of reference, is              attached as an appendix to this Report.                  Tho Committee has given further consideration to              the proposal-that a one-volume history of the Ministry              of Munitions should he prepared summarising the history              of that Department, and are of the opinion that the              expense involved in the preparation of this history would              not be justified.Initialled on behalfof the Committee)      &apos;3S.

Interim Report of the History of the Ministry                         of Munitions.     The Terms  of Reference given to this Committee bythe Prime Minister  on  the 28th December; .1922, included     (d)  To consider  the question af publishing          certain sections of the History of the          Ministry  of  Munitions,2.   The existing History of the Ministry of Munitionsconsists of twelve  volumes, copies of whioh have been circulated to the various Government Departments.  Alimited number of copies of the various volumes are stillavailable,  but&apos;not  in  sufficient numbers for sale to thePublic without re-printing.3.   It appeared to be advisable for us to consider andrepo-fr.  upon the question of this History without delay,as considerable cost to the Stationery Office is involvedin the storage of the type for these twelve volumes.4.   It has been pointed out to the  Committee that Volumes9-12 contain highly secret matter,  which it would be undesirable to issue to the Public.   The cost of the revision necessary before these volumes would be suitablefor issue&apos;would be considerable.5.   The Committee are of the opinloti:-     (a)  That the cost of re-printing the present          Volumes I to XII would not be justified.     fb)  That Sir Graham Greene should be authorised          to give instructions for the breaking up of          the &quot;existing &quot;type1&apos; of the History of the          Ministry of Munitions;
(o)   Ihat  from the  existing  copies of this History     a  circulation  should be made to the Admiralty,     War Office, Air Ministry, Colenial Office and     India Office for distribution to the Dominion     Governments, Staff Colleges, etc;(d)   That  any further copies remaining of Volumes     I  to  VIII should be distributed to selected     Institutes, Libraries,  etc. in the United     Kingdom.(Intd.)
