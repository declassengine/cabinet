.lIFl TJOCUMEIT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITA1WIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERKIIBxTT.S30K.iT.                          COPY NO. /JCABI1HT.       CiP.366(23).                 COMMITTEE  01 UNEMPLOYMENT.     IEM01W)TJM BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND OS. THE           COMMITTEE&apos;S REPORT (CP. 356(83)).          I refer to paragraph E. of the Report and to the suggestion contained therein that Departments should he instructed- to prepare sohemes for the  provision of further assisted employ- nent.          I am gravely concerned at the present conditions prevailing in Glasgow and the other, great industrial centres, of the Clyde.    To  take one industry alone, via., shipbuilding I find that  in  1913,  &quot;37,000  and in 1920-43,000 men were employed in this industry.   In March of this year 19,000 only were. employed.   Speaking broadly there appear to be 24,000.of  these; workers unemployed on the Clyde at present.   The above figures refer to journeymen and apprentices only.    In addition there are the shipyard labourers, roughly about 35 per cent. more. For all classes  the present unemployment figure in Clyde shipyards may be  put at 32,000.   It  is perhaps of interest to compare the shipbuilding  position with that of industry  generally the percentage unemployment in all insured trades (Great Britain and Northern  Ireland) in May, 1923, was 10.7.   In shipbuilding (same area) it was 32,1, and in Scottish shipbuilding 39.4.  It is further important to remember that.the shipyard workers are only a part of the mass of workers dependant on shipbuilding. To get  a true view of the situation it is necessary to consider the ancillary trades, of which the principal are marine engineering and  boilermaking.   In Glasgow and the Clyde the niEiber employed  was in March, 1923, about 10,600 and 2,200 in these two  trades as against 21,600, and 5,500 in 1920.          I give these figures - which are not up to date, but show no appreciable improvement at present - to show the very  srious position at present existing in this area.   One of the serious aspects  is that the majority of these men are skilled  orkers who when in employment were earning  very good wages, to  hich the  amount they now draw in Unemployment Benefit or  from  wish councils  bears a very small proportion.          The not unnatural consequence is that there is at  resent existing in this area a spirit of hopelessness and  ullen discontent which is very disquieting.   This area as my  flleagues know has always been one of the storm centres in   e Kingdom,  and unless some substantial contribution of work  ari be made to provide employment  to a number of. these men, I am  ery apprehensive as to what may happen here in the coming  inter.h        Unfortunately the schemes of work suggested by theindustrial Group in their letter to the Prime Minister of 24th&quot;atant,  a number of which were approved by the Committee onf;Unemployment/
Unemployment on the 27th instant do not&apos;apply to Scotland,and accordingly Glasgow will not profit thereby except to a very limited extent, if orders for plant and materialare placed there.          A suggestion ie made in the letter that theschemes may include electrification of some of the railwayround Glasgow, and I understand that this is to beconsidered.          The position is however .in my opinion so serious that I think it is-necessary to explore everyavenue with the purpose of endeavouring to provide workfor the unemployed skilled workmen in Glasgow and the clyde area of a nature as near akin as possible to theirown work, and I propose therefore to givevinstructionsthat enquiries should be made with this object in view,          I think it right to take this opportunity of warning my colleagues of the dangers of the presentposition in this area, and at the same time of indicating that if the enquiries I propose to make result in theframing of any suitable schemes for providing work Ishall ask the concurrence of my colleagues in addingthese to the list of schemes already approved.NOVAE,Scottish  Office,      Whitehall,  S.W.1.           31st July,  1923.
