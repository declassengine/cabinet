*   /  &apos; GOT RHMENT)CABINET/5TREATIES OF MJIUAL GUARANTEE AND THE REDUCTION              Of ARMAlffilTS.Idouorandum by the Fir at lord of the              Admiralty.f          The enclosed Memorandum setting out the  specificobjections, from the point of view of the laval Staff, toany Treaty of Guarantee on the lines of that suggested bylord Robert Cecil, deserves the most careful considerationof the Cabinet.   I wish, however^ in submitting it to mycolleagues, to lay before them certain general considerations which seem to me conclusive against entering upon any european Treaty of Guarantee, general or partial,  specificor indefiniteo   My conviction is that such a Treaty,whatever its shape, can only add unnecessarily to  our military commitments and increase the danger of draggingus into wars in whioh we have no real interost, withoutin the slightest degree promoting either our own peace and security or those of other Nations or leading  to anyreduotion of armamentse          Our main object is peace - peace, in the firstinstance, for ourselves, and, in a secondary degree, thatgeneral peace whioh will promote the recovery of the world and with it our own.   In such an ataosphere of peace, andwith the universal need for economy, there will be a naturaltendency to keep down armaments, and even definite arrange-nients for the limitation of armaments may become feasible.But it is essential to keep in mind that it is notarmaments, as such, which bring about wars,  but the  conflict                                                   of.....
 of  interds-ts  and. aiabitionsi   Where there  is no  real conflict, where  4 costly  cocrpe-tition  of  armaments  has grown  up almost  accidentally, or  is based  on vagus suspicion^  frank explanation and  discussion may  pat an end to  such a competition for the benefit  of all ooncornedi    That is what happonod at Washington last year,  and that is what wo should  aim  at&apos;scduring3  whether as  regards  air armaments  between  ourselves and prance, or in  any  other  direction in whioh an opportunity maypresent itself.    But where    re are fundamental differences of policy it  is  idle  to imagine that the reduction of  armaments fe  possible, or would, if  achieved, contribute  to peace.   After all, it  is  only the armed strength of the  victors of the late War, and the disarma- ment of the vanquished, which preserves  the peaoe  in Europe to-day, and will continue  to preserve it,, until suoh time as  the  now settlement of Europe  is either acquiesced  in or forcibly modified.          Any treaty of mutual guarantee must, in  fact, he  a guarantee of the status gap  established by tho recent Peace Treaties,,    jjo other guarantee would be acceptable to  any  of our late Allies;   and,  for the same reason, no such guarantee could really b&amp; acceptable to any of our late enemies,    we should be committed by it to intervening by  force in order to maintain, in every  detail, a settlement  which,  by the very nature of  the circumstances under which ill; was concluded, could not be wholly equitable or  deserve pormanonce in respect to many of its features.   i/e should bo  stereotyping the rigid division of Europe into two camps,  instead of giving reasonable free play to the  forces whioh will gradually, by a series of                                                   minor....
-&quot;minor-- upheavals t bring about  the necessary readjustment.          We.have been through all this before.  The  same attempt at a treaty of mutual guarantee was made after the Napoleonic wars.   So convinced were  its promoters of the blessings of peace and diarm&amp;ment that would flow from it, that they, in all good faith, christened their pact  the &quot;Holy Alliance&apos;.&apos;   We earned the gratitude of Europe  by first abstaining from, and subsequently thwarting, a combination which soon became synonymous with tyranny; and reaction.  We did so for motives which aryoly with no less force to-day than a centiiry ago,  lor one thing, now as then, we do not understand the -peace settlement in the same isense. as our late Alliess  Our  disagreement with the French over their methods in  the Ruhr is only typical of a fundamental divergence in outlook  which will become more marked every year,  lo compact  is going to bind -oublio opinion in this country to intervene, by arms or blockade, against its own sympathies, on occasions where the re-adjust^ msnt of the European situation is accompanied by what will undoubtedly be some act of aggression against the present status quo 0-          For another thing, even more to-day than a  century agOj any such compact means for us military obligations without any corresponding advantages,  ^he dangers which confront us are in the pacific, on the Afghan Frontier, in the Middle Easts in Africa,,  In none of these are we likely to receive any assistance from the European Powers, whose peace wa guarantee, that would justify the reduction of our exiguous forces by one ship or one-battalion.  In Europe, on the other hand, exoe-nt for the possible menace  of air invasion from France, we are in no danger whatever.  Why on earth should we get committed to intervening in conflicts which we should otherwise keep clear of,  as we  kept clear  of                                                  every.,..
every European war between 1815 and. 1914, with the one exception of the Crimean War which concerned, us not as a european but as an Eastern Power?         Lord. Robert Cecil, indeed, frankly contemplates atreaty under which the guarantee is confined to-separatecontinents.  That is a point of view which, carried to itslogical conclusion, would mean the dissolution of the BritishEmpire, and its replacement by a political organisation of theworld in continents.  Against such an artificial and unnaturalconception  I would set the conception of strengthening thatworld-wide pact of mutual guarantee,  based on a policy ofpeace and purely defensive armaments,  and on an enduringcommunity of ideals and methods&quot;, which is known as theBritish Commonwealth,and of associating it as closely aspossible with that other great Commonwealth of kindred outlookthe United States.         It may be said that some such treaty as is advocatedis a necessary corollary of the Covenant of the League ofNations and that our acceptance of the one compels us toendeavour to carry but the other.  That argument  raises a fundamental issue with regard to the  existence of the Leagueof Nations itself.  The people of the  United States rejected the League of Nations because, reading the clauses of theCovenant literally, as they are accustomed to read thearticles of their own Constitution, they feared that theywould be involved by it in commitments and responsibilities which they were not prepared to face.   We, here and else-where in the Ennire, accepted the League because  we believed,and believed rightly,  that the method  of conference and discussion among nations ?rould tend to promote peace  by                                                      better.0
better mutual understanding.   We ignored the fears whichinfluenced Americans, because we attached no real importanceto the form of the clauses which they regarded as so pregnantwith concealed menace,   But if we are told that our acceptance of the League compels us to draw from those veryclauses the conclusion which America rejected, and thatthe general obligation to work for peace and disarmament isto issue in a rigid compact for the maintenance of the presentterritorial settlement, and for intervention in every caseof &quot;aggression&quot;, then I am certain that the people of thiscountry and of the Dominions will decide that the United&quot;States were right in their misgivings, and will come to regard the League of Nations as they regarded the HolyAlliance a hundred years ago, as a league for repression andinterference of which we should do well to wash our handsas speedily and as completely as possible,                           &apos; ( INITIALEDo )  LoSoA.  ,4th July0  1923,i
         NAVAL  STAFF  MEMOPANDLWu .Treaty of Mutual Guarantee and Resolution XIV of   the Assembly of the League of Nations,1922.    lo    The strength of the Navy Is determined by the  -necessity of preserving the safety of&quot;the Empire against all possible adversaries, and the one-power standardhas been fixed hy the British Government and by thoImperial Conference as the minimum strength to ensurethat safety.-   The standard is at present one of equality with the United States of America^  Unless that standardis formally abandoned the Naval Staff cannot concur In anyproposal which appears to contemplate any reduction of theBritish Navy, nor can the Admiralty accept the Treaty of guarantee as a justification for allowing British Naval Powerto fall below the strength of any other Naval Power,   TheUnited States of America are outside the League, and wouldnot be parties to the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee, and again,the United  States of America are left free under theWashington  Treaty, which only remains in force until December1936, to increase their Naval Forces after that date&apos;.  Inthese circumstances it is obviously out of the question forthis Country to accept the proposals in the Treaty of mutual Guarantee that the Naval Forces of  the Empiro shall besubject to  revision at the expiration of ten years, arid  that thes^forces shall not be increased In time of peace ?rithout the consentof  the Council of the League of Nations,    20-    As a matter of fact the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee ifratified would throw large and unknown commitments upon  theBritish Navy,   The British Navy would certainly always be thefirst Force to be called upon:  In  the words of  the Reportof  the Temporary Mixed Commission for 1922 - &quot;in the caseof  armed assistance certain forces  such as aircraft andwarships are the most rea.dily available and therefore  the most likely  to &quot;be asked for and to be effective In  the  initial stages of  the War&quot;.    3.-     It is  the considered opinion of  the  NaVal staff that&apos;to carry out  the provisions of  such a treaty would,  infact, necessitate an increase In our Naval Forces&apos;,,  provision would have to be made for meeting  the commitments under  theTreaty as  these  commitments might arise when  the servicesof  the Fleet were required elsewhere, and. without an  Increase,our Forces  would be  insufficient  to  cope with  a  war between this  Country and an adversary in a  distant part  of  theworld,    4,-     The  Nav Q  Staff are opposed  to portions of theNavy  being practically at  the disposal of  the  League for aseries  of  campaigns of  indefinite duration and magnitude.In the  20  years  prior  to  1914  there  were many  importantwars  into  which  this  Country was not drawn, and  if weattempted  to avert and  suppress  a  similar  series of wars in the future the Navy would be  continuously  employed on war service^ which might well cause  losses  in  ships  thus reducingus below  the One  Power  Standard  at  possibly a  critical  time.
5.-       The obligations under the Treaty to render assistance to a Country attacked may in the Treaty be limited in principle to those Countries situated in the same partof the globe, but the regional aspect of the Guarantee usunlimited in the case of a world-wide Empire, and the Royalor Dominion Navies would be liable to be called upon toenforce the Treaty and to furnish a quota of ships in any 3eain the event of a menace of war&apos;(,   One of the gravestconsequences of the Treaty might be that the British %vymight be called upon to exercise pressure on the UnitedStates, which is outside the League., should that Countrymenace a small American Power which is in the Leagues6&apos;c-       As a French Member of the Temporary Mixed CommissionColonel Requin has drafted a treaty which carries in his-view,and possibly in that of the French Government, the principlesof Resolution XIV into effect (which treaty has been producedas an alterative to that prepared by Lord Robert Cecil) , theNaval Staff wish to make it clear that the above observationshave been made on Lord Robert Cecil!s draft General Treaty of mutual Guarantee0(INITIALED)    Bo    3*  7.  23.
