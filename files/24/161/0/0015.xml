CpKENE  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ QOVBRMEHP *                THERAPEUTIC i SUBSTANCES BILL.        Memorandum ^ by  the  Minister  of   Hog.lt          The increasing use of sera, vaccines,  and  suchtherapeutic s*u.b stances aa salvarsan, the strength of which cannotbe tested by chemical analysis and which are  specially liable todangerous contamination, renders it necessary that step3  should betaken to secure as far as practicable that  these  preparations should only be sold under conditions which  secure proper  care inmanufacture and which will enable a statement to  be  given to the doctor of the strength of the preparation.   The  necessity forsome control of therapeutic substances which  are  Incapable of chemical analysis has already been recognised in  many othercountries, e.g. Norway, Sweden, Prance, Germany,  Italy, Spain.In the United States the manufacture of such  preparations is subjectto rigid inspection, while In other countries such as Denmark theimportance of standardising vaccines and sera has led to  theirpreparation being limited to the State Serological Institute.   Asindicative of the need for standardisation  I nay  mention  the casesof salvarsan and pituitary extract.   No amount  of care in thepreparation of salvarsan and similar arsenical products can ensureagainst the risk that a particular batch may  attain  a degree oftoxicity which would make their use dangerous and oven fatal.Every batch requires to be tested by biological methods,  a precaution the enforcement of which has only been secured up tothe present with great difficulty.   Pituitary extract which is used to induce labour may under present conditions vary In strength in the ratio of 1 to 80.   In the absence of  any  trustworthyindication of the degree of potency It is clear that  tho  doctorC A B I H E T *.315 Jjll&apos;Copy No.  ill
can have little idea of the  strength  of the dose which he isemploying and this has  already  led to fatal results in more thanone case.          The question  was investigated by a DepartmentalCommittee under the Chairmanship of Sir Mackenzie Chalmers, whosereport was issued to Parliament  in 1921,  as Command Paper No.Cr.id.1156.   The detailed machinery of control recommended by thisCommittee contemplated  the  creation of a  new controlling authority.This seemed to me capable of modification and the attached Billembodies revised proposals whioh will, I  believe, secure theobject In view with a minimum cost to public funds.   Broadly,it is proposed to schedule to the Bill those substances whichshould at once be brought under control.   The most important of these are vaccines,  sera, anti-toxins, salvarsan and itssubstitutes and animal  extracts such  as pltuitrin and insulin.It is proposed that these should only be  manufactured underlicense and that the conditions attaching to the license shouldbe  laid down by a Joint Committee consisting of the ministers in  charge of the Health Departments in England and Wales,Scotland and Northern Ireland.   This Committee will have the expert assistance of an Advisory Committee consisting ofrepresentatives of the  threo Health Departments, tho medical research Council, the General Medical Council  and theIhwaaceutAoal Society.   The enforcement of the regulations will rest with the appropriate health departments in each country.   The Regulations will cover such points as standardof  strength, teats to be applied, form of packing.   Scheduledsubstances imported from abroad will  be required to beconsigned to  a licensed agent end will be subject to the sametests as home products.   The Bill also  provides that the JointCommittee shall have power to sdd to  the  list  of  scheduled
products as scientific  developments may from time to timerequire.   The testing  work  necessary under the Bill will bedone by the Medical Research Council Staff as a part of theirordinary duties.          It is net anticipated  that the home producers, ofwhom the number is very limited, will offer any opposition tothe Bill, which will incidentally protect them against thecompetition of lower grade foreign imports.   In this connection it should be mentioned  that  there is at present nothing toprevent the importation into this country of therapeuticsubstances which have been rejected in America as fallingbelow the prescribed standard.   I therefore ask the consentof my colleagues to the introduction of this Bill at an earlydate in the House of Lorda,  on the understanding that it willnot be taken in the House of Commons until, the autumn.   Therewill be no difficulty in arranging for the necessary time in the lords.                                 ( Intld.) N.C.Ministry of Health,        July &amp;th, 1923.
