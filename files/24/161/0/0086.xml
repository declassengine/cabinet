 &apos;THIS D0CU131W IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC IIAJ.E3TY13. GOTE?!&quot;.^^                             CABINET.             RETREHOHlgINT OP LEAGUE OF IT AH PITS EXPENDITURE.       f3*                 Further llemoran&amp;um by. the Financial Secretary         to the Treasury.jret,               I ask leave to submit the following observationsf$8&amp;  (23)         on the Memorandum (C.P.379 (23)) circulated by the lord Privy         Seal.  &quot;              1.   It  is inoorreot to state that my Memorandum         (C,0i373 (23))  proposes a reduction of 25$ On the expenditure         of the League in 1925 as compared with 1924.  The correct         figure is 16$ viz.  from  894,000 to  750,000,-   It was         expressly Stated in paragraph 11 that the  figura of  750,000         was exclusive of the sum, if any,  required for the worliing         capital fuhd  in 1925,  whioh oannot be predicted.   This item         must;  of course,  also  be excluded from the 1924  figures         before a comparison is made between the two years.                  Apart  from the International Labour Organisation,         the reduction proposed is 10$ only.    Similar or greater         reductions, in  ordinary expenditure as distinct  from expenditure         due to the War,  have been made  in  Government  Departments in         this country, without  destruction  of efficiency  or any loss         of prestige or  authority - attributes which in any case are         not measured  by  expenditure.   At  a later stage in his         Memorandum, the  Lord Privy Seal  refers to  the cost of the         Department of Lunacy and Mental  Deficiency (really the Board         of Control) which he gives as 5529,000;  he has not,  however,         noticed that  we  have effected a  reduction  of approximately  10$.         this year, reducing  that  figure  to  479,000,   The expenditure         Is,  of course,  almost  wholly  in  respect of the maintenance  of         lunatics, not like  League of  Nations  expenditure  on office         staffs.                  The  3ritish Department which can  be  seriously         compared to the  league of Nations  as  regards the  scope of
 its work is,  surely,  the Foreign  Offioe.  The  Foreign  Offioe Tote has been reduced this year by 17$ from  245,000 to  204,000,     2.   In the particular oase of the International Labour Organisation  a heavier reduction has been proposed, viz,, by 33$ from  287,000  ten  200,000.  I have explained what reasons  there are for  thinking serious waate exists there: these  reasons are:-     (a)  the weakness of the Financial organisation -            half the members of the Governing Body being            interested in increasing rather than diminishing            expenditure;     (b)  the Watson Report and its suppression by the            Finance Committee;  and     (o)  the admission by the Offioe  in their own revised            Estimates  that the limitations introduced in            1924 are only a first step in the re-organisation            and the removal, of parasitic growths. How oan  this be reconciled with the statement that the expenditure has been reduced to. the lowest level compatible with efficiency?         I oannot oonceive a stronger case for pressing eoonomies, and have no belief that anything of importance will be  effected short of action such as I have suggested.     3,   The organisation of the Secretariat is admittedly better than that of the International Labour Offioe,  though I am confident it oould stand a 10$ out at least as well as, our own  Foreign Offioe has managed to effect  a reduction of 17$,  The reference to the flotation of the Austrian Loan (whioh I had expressly pointed to in my  own Memorandum as an example of good work by the league)  seems to be  beside the point. The  greater part of the -work was not done by &quot;the League  Secretariat  but by otner  agencies e,g, the   ahk of England.   There  is  no  reason whatever  to suppose that,  if superfluous Activities  are out  down and certain  elements  of extravaganoe  eliminated,  the League Organisation,  therefore,becomes unable to deal with, this-and similar questions.
     4.   The fact is that the salaries and organisation ofthe League -were fixed in the atmosphere of general tptimismand lax administration which followed the Armistice;   theywere perhaps not too grandiose by comparison with Governmentactivities in this country about the same time, butsevere retrenchment has been oarried out in the latter field and the League tf Nations has lagged behind.          What real reason can be suggested why the salaries of League Officials Bhould not be adjusted in accordancewith the fall in the cost of living?   The Treasury has been pressing this point for a long time, but the matter iscontinually bandied about from one Committee to another and no action taken,   We do net even  now,  August 10th,know what, if any, definite proposals for adjusting;salarieswill be put before the Assembly  when it meets at thebeginning of September,   If nothing is done then, nothing more can be done for a full twelve months, and so the matterdrifts on.          As another illustration of where reforms arewanted, I give a short table showing how the subsistence rategranted by the League to members of Committees etc,,viz., 70 Swiss franoa a night, works out in some largeoapltals by comparison with our own highest  rates for officials eent in similar circumstances to the same towns:-                         JmBU&amp;JS&amp;Sa       British Olvil                                            Service ratesParis               224 French francs      115 French francsBrussels            294 Belgian  &quot;         158 Belgian  &quot;Roma                299, lire               160 lireGeneva               70 Swiss franca       From 38-50 Swiss                                                      francs          10hat is the Justification for paying the sameindividual twice as much when he 1B abroad on League  business as when he is abroad on business of the British Government?                           - a -
It is useless to say that it is a small point to bo taken up with the League separately.   We have taken it up withthe League again and again without obtaining anysatisfaction.   What remedy can the Lord Privy Seal suggestshort of giving the League less money to spend and enforcingeconomy that way?     5.   I must add a short note of warning against theassumption made  repeatedly1 in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sMemorandum that Great Britain pays only 10% of the Leagueexpenditure.   The fact is that, when the League was set up,it was agreed that expenses should be allocated on the universal Postal Union basis undor which Great britain would pay 4.9$ only.   This apportionment has been twicechanged and Great britain&apos;s contribution steadily increasedto 10%,   Further changes are actually being consideredwhich, I am advised, may further increase cur proportionsubstantially.          Moreover the contributions of the British Umpireas a whole now equal 25% of the League&apos;s expenditure.Unless the actual deadweight burden is reduced I foreseethe possibility of serious disputes between Great BritainIndia and the Dominions ending in increased payment by theUnited Kingdom.    This was plainly foreshadowed last yearwhen Lord Balfour got the Budget accepted only on an understanding, rather vaguely expressed, that the Empireas a whole would be responsible for the Empire&apos;scontributions,          I do not suggest that the League&apos;s work is not ofthe highest value:   and well worth while even if expressed on the lowest ground as an insurance premium.   My point isthat equal results can be obtained without extravagances in expenditure in themselves very detrimental to the reputation of the League,
     6.   A memorandum (C,P.383/23)) has also been circulatedby the Minister of Labour,   The points which he presses are     (l)  that the only way to effect &quot;further big economieseither in the League expenditure generally,  or in that of theInternational Labour Office is by a speoial  Committee whichoan only be appointed by the General Assembly of the League; :     (2)  that there must be no discrimination when eoonomiesare pressed for as between the League and the InternationalLabour Office.          I should raise no objection to the proposal thatour representatives at Geneva should press for a Commissionof Enquiry provided that the Commission is entrusted withthe definite task of recommending reforms which will bringthe 1925 Budget,  excluding the sum if any required for theworking capital fund, within the total of  750,006,    If theCommission receive a mere general mandate to suggest economiestheir proposals would need the sanction of the Assembly inthe Autumn of 1924,   The various branches of the&apos;Leaguewill then have drawn up their budgets;   they may Ignorein doing so the Commissions recommendations on the  groundthat they have not received the approval of  the Assembly,and, if the Assembly does finally approve the recommendations,we shall be told that it is too late to bring them into full effect that yeare          The important point is to get the  principle of a fixed total for 1925 approved by the Assembly this year,before any work has been done on the actml  drafting ofBudgets,   Then,  no subordinate body will be in a positionto. resist reductions on the ground that authority for the reductions has not been given by the Assembly,,
