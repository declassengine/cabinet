Note by the Secretary of State for the colonies covering Report of the Co.committee on Irish AiYaxrs.      I circulate to my colleagues the accompanyingReport of the Committee on Irish Affairs on the questionof Land Purchase in Northern Ireland.(Signed)     DEVONSHIRE,Colonial Office,   July 27th, 1923.
            LAID PURCHASE IB NORTHERN IRELAND.          REPORT OF. COMMITTEE ON IRISH AFFAIRS.      Under section 9 (5) of the Government Act, 1920, thepower of legislating for the completion of Land Purchase inIreland was reserved to the Imperial Parliament.  His Majesty&apos;3Government were pledged to  submit to Parliament legislation on the lines of the scheme agreed between representatives ofthe landlords and tenants and recommended by the IrishConvention of 1917,   In 1920 a bill on these  lines was introduced in the House of Commons, but the Government were unable to proceed with it for want of time.   With the approvalof the Irish Treaty by Parliament and the Dail the power to legislate on the, subject in Southern Ireland passed to thelegislature of the Free State, and a Bill to complete LandPurchase has just been carried from the Dail to the Senate.But, as the duty of legislating on land purchase for NorthernIreland still remains with the Imperial Parliament, theChancellor of the Exchequer appointed a committee, with LordEustace Percy as Chairman, to consider the terms of a Bill andto make recommendations accordingly.      Lord Eustace Percy&apos;s Committee have now recommended that legislation should be passed in the forthcoming Autumn session on the lines of the Convention Report of 1917.      If this course is adopted^ the income secured to the landlords of Northern ireland will exceed the Income secured in the measure now before the Free State Legislature to the landlords in the 26 counties by a figure varying from 9i6 percent, to 20.1 per cent.   The reasons which have led Lord EustacePercy and his colleagues to advise that the Bill should bedrawn on the lines of the Convention scheme will be found inparagraph 9 of their Report, which is now submitted to theCabinet,                                                        /
mJuly 27thT  1925.advise the Cabinet to authorise a Bill to be drafted inaccordance with  the  findings of the Committee, with a viewto its introduction  in the  House of Commons in time to become law before the  close of the present year.  But In making thisrecommendation  the Irish Affairs Committee wish the Cabinetclearly to recognize that if it is  adopted the terms securedto the Northern  landlords will be substantially better thanthose  secured under  Free State Legislation to the landlordsin the South.      We  have further to advise that the Report of LordEustace Percy&apos;s  Committee should not be published until theBill is introduced in the House of  Commons.      With reference to paragraph 16 of the rteport, we areof opinion tnat  the  scheme  should be financed bv the issueof a new 4-g-  per  cent, stock.

TO THE LORDS COMMISSIONERS OF  HIS  MAjEs                        TREASURY.MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIPS,    1. We have the honour to submit our report on the tenfuture land purchase in Northern Ireland. Since our appointon the 5th June, 1923, we have held seven sittings, and havclevidence from representatives of the Irish Landowners&apos; Canym(Northern Branch) and of the Ulster Farmers&apos;  Union, and Iindependent tenant witnesses.    2. It was not,  we think, the intention of  the Govcrnmaappointing us, nor did it appear to us desirable, that we sinattempt  to survey the whole problem of land purchase it that problem has been before His Majesty&apos;s Government lota century and has been dealt with on well-known  lines.  Itit is true, now entered on a new phase.  All parties concerned 1been for some time agreed that land purchase should be comptas soon as possible by converting what has hitherto been a v&apos;tary system into a compulsory one.  We found at the outsttour enquiry  that  we could rule out as useless any attemptinaugurate a new voluntary scheme.  The introduction oipulsion no doubt calls for a. careful review of the whole subjibut this review  has already been undertaken.  In  1917 theirConvention  appointed a  Sub-Committee  on  Land  Purclwhich reported  on the 23rd January,  1918.  The report siunanimous one, agreed by the representatives  both  of lamand tenants, and was adopted by the Convention.  It recommend&apos;a scheme of compulsory purchase based upon an automatic fixatof  annuities and bonus, but, so  far from rejecting the basicpciples upon which previous voluntary schemes  had been firit  proposed that the transactions effected under the WyndAct should be  made  the standard for this  automatic fixatitThe reason for  this  is sufficiently obvious.  Since  all parties agreed  that  land  purchase should  be completed at the eaii possible moment, compulsion is required as a means,  not so mi of coercion, as of automatic adjustment.  There is, therefore, reason  why the introduction  of  compulsion  should materii alter the basis of  purchase.  On the contrary, such an alteraii would be manifestly unfair, as discriminating between estatess before  1909  tinder the favourable financial terms  offered by Is Wyndham Act and  estates where sale was arrested after th date when less  favourable terms were substituted by the Bin Act. This was recognised by the Convention, and we, in our tn have confined  ourselves to the consideration how best the pii ciples of land purchase previously laid down and  unanimoa accepted by the Convention can be adapted to the circumstatf of the moment.
TO  THE  LORDS  COMMISSIONERS  OF  HIS  MAJESTY                        TREASURY.MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIPS,    1. We have the honour to submit our report on the terms of future land purchase in Northern Ireland.  Since our appointmenton the 5th June, 1923, we have held seven sittings, and have heardevidence from representatives of the Irish Landowners&apos; Convention(Northern Branch)  and of the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union, and fromindependent tenant witnesses.   2. It was not, we think, the intention of the Government inappointing us, nor did it appear to us desirable, that we should attempt to survey the whole problem of land purchase de now.That problem has been before His  Majesty&apos;s Government for halfa century and has been dealt with on well-known lines.  It hasit is true, now entered on a new phase.  All parties concerned havebeen for some time agreed that land purchase should be completedas soon as possible by converting what has hitherto been a voluii-tary system into a  compulsory one.   We  found at  the outset ofour enquiry  that we could rule out  as useless any attempt to inaugurate a new voluntary  scheme.   The introduction of com-pulsion no doubt calls for a. careful review of the whole subject,but this review has already been undertaken,   In 1917 the IrishConvention   appointed  a  Sub-Committee  on  Land Purchasewhich reported on  the 23rd January, 1918.  The report was a unanimous one, agreed by the representatives both of landlordsand tenants, and was adopted by the Convention.  It recommended scheme of compulsory purchase based upon  an automatic fixationof annuities and bonus, but, so far from rejecting the basic prin-ciples upon which  previous voluntary schemes had been framed,it proposed that the transactions  effected under the WyndhamAct should  be made the standard for this automatic fixation.The reason for this is sufficiently  obvious.  Since all parties are agreed that land purchase should be completed at the earliestpossible moment, compulsion is required as a means, not so muchof coercion, as  of automatic adjustment.  There is, therefore, noreason why  the introduction of  compulsion should materiallyalter the basis of purchase.   On the  contrary, such an alterationwould be manifestly unfair, as discriminating between estates soldbefore 1909 under the favourable  financial  terms offered by theWyndham Act and estates where sale was arrested after thatdate when less favourable terms were substituted by the BirrellAct.  This was recognised by  the Convention, and we, in our tun),have confined our/selves to the consideration how best the prin-ciples of land purchase previously laid down and unanimouslyaccepted by the Convention can be adapted to the circumstancesof the moment.
  3 In view of what we have already said about the nature ftjie compulsion which it is now proposed to introduce, it is fflent that a compulsory scheme should, as far as possible; be ased on the general assent of both landlords  and  tenants. nch assent  was secured by the  agreement embodied in the /invention report and we believe that it would be contrary to(lie interest of both parties to throw the whole question of landpurchase once more into the melting  pot.  The effect of any suchaction would necessarily be to postpone indefinitely  a solution which,  by  common  consent,  is urgently required. .  We have,therefore, adopted the Convention report as the basis of our deliberations.   The   recommendations  of  that  report   wereembodied in  a Bill introduced into  the House  of Commons in1920, and  that  Bill  forms  a convenient  :framework for the drafting of  new  legislation,  but the  Convention report must remain the authoritative document for interpreting the agreement.  4. The  Convention  report was  based  upon  three main principles-   (a)  that the  tenanfs annuity should be fixed &quot; at the same       proportion  of his  existing rent as the annuities of       previous tenant purchasers of the same class formed of       their rents,&quot; and that &quot; variations in local circumstances       can be most fairly met by applying to each  case the       average reduction in the annuity as compared with the       rent, not for all Ireland, but for the county in  which       each holding is situate &quot; ;   (6)  that the  landlord should receive payment at face value       in stock  bearing interest at a rate sufficient to render       any serious depreciation unlikely and redeemable  by       means lof sinking fund accumulations ;  and   (c)  that the  State should, in  addition, pay the landlord a       cash bonus sufficient, with the purchase money provided       by  the tenanfs annuity, to &quot; yield an adequate income       as compared with the landlords net rental.&quot;  On this basis the  Convention report recommended  that thetenant should pay a percentage of  his existing rent  fixed  bycounties, and that the landlord should receive payment in 5 pertent. British Guaranteed Stock redeemable by periodical drawings,with I  per  cent,  sinking fund, and a rate of bonus  varyinginversely with the number of  years&apos; purchase.   The  effect oftee recommendations in  the case  of the six counties in theSorthern area is  shown on pages  6 and  7 in  tables extracted from the Convention report.  The assumption in the last columnif these tables is that the cash bonus will yield the same rate perart. as the stock. 5. In one  respect it is impossible to-day to adopt these termswhanged.   The  rate  of interest for Government  borrowingas  fallen considerably, and in conformity with the second prin-principle set forth  above, the  denomination  of  the  stock should

properly be reduced to-day to A\ per cent.  Any such reductionwithout consequential adjustments, would automatically produtxthe following effects :     (a)  it would increase the nominal number of years purchase          and would thus reduce  the amount of bonus payable          by the Government to the  landlord on the Convention          scale ;    (b)  it.would  slightly increase  the duration of  the tenants          annuity ;  and    (c)  it would reduce  the landlords income, even apart from          the  reduction in  bonus,  through  the application to          amortization of a slightly larger fraction of the tenants          annuity.   In order not to throw on  the  landlord and tenant the full effect of the altered rate of  interest, we think that  the state should be prepared to pay the same  amount  in cash bonus as itwould have paid  under the Convention  terms.   If  this is done,a landlord in, e.g., Co.  Londonderry will, in the case of a secondterm  rent,  still receive   191  although  his nominal number ofyears&apos; purchase will increase from  15&apos;92 years to over  17 years&apos;.This will  not  indeed give  the landlord  in Co.   Londonderrythe  same income  of   89 -1  as   he would   have  received  ona 5 per  cent, basis,- if we adopt  the assumption made by theConvention that  the cash bonus will realise the same  rate ofinterest  as the stock, i.e.,  only 4\  per cent, instead of 5 percent., but in view of the fact that  the proposal always was thatthe bonus should be paid in cash, we do not think that the Statecan be regarded as bound, by reason merely of a fall in the rate ofinterest, to pay a larger sum in cash as bonus.   In fact, under theConvention scheme the  landlord clearly took the risk of a fallin the rate of interest on the cash  received as bonus, and if that scheme  had been, passed into law in  1920 many landlords would to-day be receiving bonus which they could only invest  at current rates.   The question  whether, apart from this,  the  landlordsincome  will remain the  same  as it would have been under theConvention scheme, depends on the  amount  of sinking fund tobe provided on the proposed  4J- per cent, stock.   In order togive the landlord  the same income on his purchase  money apartfrom bonus, the tenant  purchasers annuity must be capitalizedat 4-725 per cent, and the sinking fund would therefore be only4s. 6d.  per cent.    The effect of  this  reduction in the  sinkingfund, coupled with the reduction in the rate at which that sinkingfund will accumulate, will be  to increase the  period over whichthe tenant&apos;s annuity will be paid from about 62 years  tinder theConvention scheme to  about 68J1- years.  This is approximatelyidentical with the average estimated  period under the WyndhamAct (i.e.,  10s. per cent, sinking fund accumulating  at  about therate of  2f per cent.).    There will, however,  certainly be somedifference  of opinion as  to the propriety of such a  reduction in
 the amount of the sinking fund.   The tenants are familiar with the idea of a 5s. per cent, sinking fund, and, as there may be somef eeitimate doubt as to the proper way of adapting the Convention scheme in this respect to  the changed conditions of the market, we think it will on the whole be best to  keep the sinking fund at the amount, rather than at the proportion, recommended by the Convention.   The effect  of this  will  be to make the duration of the tenanfs annuity about 66 J- years and to reduce the landlord^ income by about 8s. per cent.                      .   6. At this point we have to consider the claims put forward in evidence by the representatives of  the  tenants and landlords respectively.   The landlords&apos; main case  was that the Convention agreement should be strictly adhered  to, but the tenants&apos; repfe- sentatives strongly urged  upon us that they should receive more favourable terms than those secured to them by that agreement. Their case appears to be based on three main grounds.   7. The  first ground is  that prices  of  agricultural  produce are now lower and local rates and labourers&apos;  wages higher than they were  in  1918.  This  may  be conceded,  but  it is hardly relevant to the principles of the Convention  agreement.  That agreement proceeded on the assumption  that a purchase annuity once fixed is to  continue unaltered during the sixty odd years during which it is payable,  notwithstanding variations of prices, local rates or wages, that may occur  from time to time during that period.  At any given  point in the period,  the purchase annuity may be relatively higher in comparison with the tenanfs profits  than at the  beginning, but this  is not  a ground for  its reduction  any more than  an increase  in&apos; the  tenanfs profits is a  ground for  its increase.  The  Convention did not  fix the purchase annuities in accordance with  the prices or outgoings as they existed  in  1918.  They took the  average amounts of the purchase  annuities  to   which the  purchased tenants had agreed, not in one particular year, but throughout the six years 1903-1909  during which  the Wyndham Act was  in operation. Comparisons, therefore,   between prices in  1918 and present prices cannot  be used to prove  that the Convention  rates of purchase annuities are no longer appropriate.   8. The second ground on which the tenants&apos; contention is based is that, in the case of the unpurchased tenant, the purchase annuity should be fixed at  rates lower than those at  which the voluntary  purchases under  the Wyndham Act were effected, as  a  sort of compensation  for the loss  which the unpurchased tenants have suffered through being deprived of the  benefit of purchase and being  obliged to pay full rents instead of reduced purchase annuities.   It should be noted that  this claim is. not based upon changes which  have occurred  since  the Convention report.   The earliest Wyndham Act purchasers obtained  the benefit  of purchase in 1903  and the latest in  1909, nine yearsSt
at least before  the Convention report.   The claim,  thercfonsuch  as it is, could have been equally well made in  1918, bnit was not recognised  in the Convention  scheme.  Indeed, it jcontrary to the whole principle of that scheme.  As indicated iithe second paragraph of our  report, a  failure  to  complyvoluntary purchase cannot be attributed with any safety toreluctance of either landlord or tenant  to carry through tlnecessary transactions.   9. The &apos; third ground  on which the  tenants&apos; contentionbased is  that the  Free State Government have introduced Jmeasure  of  compulsory  purchase under which the purchaaannuities  are payable at lower rates than those recommendiby the Convention.  This is not an argument to which wewe can  attach  much weight.  The Free  State Governmetlhave,  we understand, decided that  the  Convention  terms ai&apos;not suitable  to existing conditions  in the Free State.  It is ntlfor us to question their decision, but it is evident that condition in the Free State are not identical with conditions in NortheiIreland, and it seems clear to us that His Majesty&apos;s Governrrmust   consider  the  problem  in  Northern  Ireland on its amerits.   It is no doubt true that comparisons will  be maiby tenants in Northern Ireland between the purchase condition!accorded to them and those accorded to tenants in the Free StallBut  this  is  not the only comparison which might  be madA more obvious comparison is that which would, certainlymade  by  tenant purchasers under  previous Acts,  if  tenanpurchasers under a new scheme were  to become subject to lowtjpurchase  annuities  than  themselves.  We feel sure, howevathat  the  only true comparison will  prove  to be that betwathe rent now being paid by the tenant purchaser and the  ann1which he will have to pay under any compulsory scheme.   10. We do not wish in any way  to under-rate the case before us  very  fairly by  the  tenants&apos;  representatives.appreciate their  point of view and recognise that among ten;who are now  passing through a period of comparative agriculturaldepression there is  some reluctance to  accept the terms Iiwhich they were prepared to agree five or six years ago at a timijof great prosperity.  For the reasons already stated, howevawe do not see any logical ground for departing from  the agnbasis  of the  Convention report.   11. It may be argued that the increase in the duration (the annuity from an  estimated 62  to an  estimated 66   years ilin itself a departure from the Convention report.   We do inthink so.   It seems quite clear from  a study of the report than  5s.  per cent, sinking fund was there proposed on the grounithat,  if such a  sinking fund were  uniformly  invested at 5 pt Icent,  by means of drawings, it would amortize the loan  as quidas the larger sinking fund provided under  previous Acts accumiilating at  lower  rates.   The standard here, as elsewhere in tb
 Convention report, is the result realised under previous schemes,:. and, as we have already pointed out, the duration ot the annuityf under  our proposals will  be, if anything, rather  less than  the estimated period under the Wyndham  Act.    12. We therefore recommend payment in 4$ per cent. Stock redeemable by periodical drawings with a sinking  fund of 5s. percent., the percentage of rent payable by the purchaser  as annuity  and  the amount  of  bonus  per   100 rental remaining unchanged.  The tables on pages 12 and 13 show the effect of these recommendations.              ,    13. There are two  subjects closely affecting the  interests  of the landlords  which  may be  conveniently  dealt with  at  this point:     (a) Under previous schemes bonus was granted  to the land- lord personally  and  operated as an  inducement  to sell.   The Convention recommended no change in this respect, and, although it might be argued that  under a compulsory scheme such  an inducement is no longer  necessary  and that the bonus should therefore be paid to  the estate where  the landlord is a  limited owner, we think payment  to the tenant for life is still justifiable as facilitating the general  assent essential to  the success of the scheme.  We therefore recommend that legislation should adhere to the provisions of the  Convention report  and  all previous schemes in this respect.    (b) The question of encumbered  estates is  a most difficult one.  It  appears to  be generally agreed that mortgages at any rate must be paid off  in cash,  but it has been suggested to us that head rents  and family charges should be payable in stock, though this formed no part of the Convention scheme.   There would, however, be  considerable  difficulty  in distinguishing between  family  charges  and mortgages, while  as regards head rents  the owner  of  such  a rent may require cash  to pay  off mortgages  or  charges  no  less than  the landlord.   Moreover, we  are by no means sure that payment  in stock would  be necessarily to the advantage of the landlord.   It is evident that,if the basis recommended by the Convention for the  redemptionof State  charges, to  which we  refer  below,  is  applied  to. theredemption of private charges, a smaller capital sum would berequired  to redeem a  head rent in cash at 21 or even 22 years&apos;purchase than to yield the same income at \\ per cent.   On the other hand, we are much  impressed by the  serious positionin which many  encumbered  estates  must  be placed  by any scheme  of compulsory purchase.  But even  if the  State wereprepared to give some additional bonus in  such cases, it wouldbe difficult to  fix a reasonable scale.    An estate with a grossrental  of   10,000 and an annual  charge for encumbrances of/oS,000  is certainly  a  heavily  encumbered   estate.

collecting his rents is probably not more than  1,500 or 15 pet Jcent, of the gross rental, and if the encumbrance in question is a4 per cent, mortgage, the purchase price for the estate under theMscheme we have recommended will be less than the capital charge Iupon it.   But if the mortgage is a 5 per cent, one, the landlords ilincome, after paying off the encumbrance, assuming that he can Isell the necessary amount of A\ per cent, stock at par, may be&quot;&apos;actually   larger  than  his present  net income.   Any extra Ibonus  would therefore  have to be calculated  on a sliding  scaleaccording to two variables, i.e:, (i) the relation between the land-lord^ presumed present net income and his gross rental,  and (ii)the relation between this percentage and the net number of years&apos;purchase  which he will obtain for his estate after paying off allencumbrances.   Any such scale,  besides being  extremely  com-1plicated, would involve the State in an unknown liability and we i cannot recommend it.   It may be worth while to point out that Ithe encumbered landlord is the only class of person concerned who Istands to benefit positively, as compared with  Convention terms, Ifrom the  fall in the rate of interest and the  consequent increase Iin the nominal number  of years&apos;  purchase.  As regards State Icharges existing at the time of sale, the Convention recommended I&quot; that  all charges due to the State, such as death duties, quit and ICrown rents, etc., should be redeemable by  the  transfer  of such Ian  amount of stock that the interest therefrom is equal to the Iamount of the charge,  where such charge is an annual  charge, Iand by the transfer of stock equal at face value to the amount of Ithe  charge, where such charge  is  a  capital  charge.&quot;   This!recommendation was not incorporated in the  1920 Bill,  and we i feel that  we  cannot do  more than  submit  the point  for the Iconsideration of  the two Governments.                       j    14. We have  recommended that purchase should  be financed]by  an issue of A\ per cent. British Government stock redeemableby yearly drawings, with a sinking fund of 5s. per cent.  This wasthe basis  of the Convention scheme except that  the stock under that scheme was  to be 5 per  cent., and we wish in this respectas  in  others  to  adhere  to  the  Convention  proposals*   Thestock will be issued gradually over a term  of years  from  1924onwards.   It cannot indeed  be assumed  with certainty that a4J  per  cent,  issue of this  class  will stand  at  par  at  anyparticular date or for  any particular period in the  future, but,while under present abnormal conditions holders of  it cannotescape some risk, the Convention report seems to have anticipateda similar risk in 1918 and we do not see how His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment can be expected  to  fix  a higher rate for obligations  to be created during this period.  There is, however, one serious ob-jection to &apos;a new issue of this kind.  The issue  contemplated by the  *The  Convention  proceeded  on the assumption that  the stock would be a guaranteed one like previous Laud Stocks, but there is no longer any reason fora distinction between British Government and British  Guaranteed  stock forthis purpose.
Icotivcntion would, in  any case,  not have been less than someH&apos;30000,000.   Dealing  with the  six counties alone we  have toHontemplate a much smaller issue.   An accurate estimate of theI total is difficult.   The Northern  Land Commission estimate theI unpurchased acreage of the six counties at 1,238,492 as againstI 1928,632 acres already sold under previous Land Purchase  ActsI or agreed to be  sold pending proceedings.  An allowance forI iintenanted lands,  demesnes and holdings of  one acre and underI may reduce this total to somewhat  over one million acres.   TheI total number of holdings in the six counties is similarly estimatedI at 129,168 of which 84,526 have been sold or agreed to be soldI leaving 44,642  still unpurchased.   The  allowance  for one-acreI holdings  and other holdings likely to fall  outside the scheme may i reduce this figure to somewhere in  the neighbourhood of 23,000I holdings, but this  may be an  underestimate.  The Landowners&apos;1 Convention estimate the  unpurchased rental at about  311,000,I the  bulk  of  which consists of second term rents,  and as  theI average rental for Northern Ireland  under the Acts of 1903-1909I was  11  per holding  this would  seem  to indicate  a figure ofI between  28,000 and 29,000 holdings.  If the landowners&apos; figureI is accurate, the  purchase  value of this rental under  our scheme  might  be  estimated   at  not  more than  5,500,000  and  the  bonus  at  about    650,000.   We  understand  the  Northern  Government  and  the Land  Commission are  inclined to putI  these figures  somewhat higher  At the  average price  per  acre!  in Northern Ireland under the  Acts  1903-1909 converted  toI  a 4  per cent,  basis the  purchase  moirey  for one  million acresj  would be  about  7,250,000.  We do not, however,  suppose that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government would  wish  necessarily to  raise the cash  bonus by  the issue of 4  per cent,  stock  since they would presumably raise the necessary cash on  the best terms available in the market  at a given moment, and therefore, making the most liberal allowance for  any possible underestimate in the above figures, we do not  see how the  total issue could  reach a higher figure than   8,000,000.  It is open  to doubt whether  so. small an issue, even when completed, would be readily marketable, while for the first  two years or so after the Act first  became operative it might be very difficult to find purchasers except at a serious discount.  It is indeed clear from the landlords&apos; insistence on a guaranteed income for a long period that they expect to hold the stock when received, but the Land Commission will have to realise considerable blocks in order to pay off encumbrances and a good market is therefore absolutely  essential to the encumbered land- lord. We do not see how  this requirement is to be realised on the basis of any special new issue of relatively small aggregate amount created, as this will necessarily be, by instalments over a series of years.   15. We have, therefore, had to consider alternative methodsof finance.  Three possible alternatives occur to us.
    (a) Payment in 5 per cent. War Loan.  This would enableto base our scheme on the  Convention tables without alterati,and would give  the landlord a  saleable stock standing to-djat  a  slight premium and  practically certain not  to fall beltpar.  It  would have the advantage that the Government would retain the power of conversion  in connection  with its general financial  policy  and it might  have the enormous advantagto  the purchaser that,  if conversion took  place  in  1929, theproportion of his  annuity devoted  to  sinking fund would greatly increased and the duration of  his annuity corresponding!diminished.  But it has one grave  disadvantage:  it involvthe capitalization  of  the  purchasers annuity  at  5J per cenwhen in fact the vendor will only receive a secure income at 5 mcent,  until 1929, and  thereafter  at  a rate  dependent upon tlterms  upon which  the Government may be  able to convert,if he  prefers  to sell at once  and reinvest in  long  term trusttsecurities, an income of not  more than  (say) 4  per cent.  Thiwould press  most&apos; hardly on vendors whose sales  may not completed before 1928, while, if purchase is not finally completeby 1929, it would be difficult to  suggest how vendors after thadate should be  paid.   It  should be noted that such a scheiris not  necessarily to the advantage of the encumbered landlorsince the difference between capitalization at    per cent, and4&apos;f per cent, is equivalent to a discount of nearly 10 per cent,a A\ per  cent, stock.  If  the  landlords thought it worth whilemake  the sacrifice involved  in this scheme in order to securefirst class marketable security, we should certainly recommendbut on present evidence we do not think that this is the case, anwe do not see how it could be imposed upon them.   The schemmight indeed  be varied by  providing that annuities shouldcapitalized at  some rate between  4  per cent, and 5J per  cent,that  the  vendor would in effect receive rather more than hiproper amount of War Loan in consideration of the probabilityconversion at a  lower rate.  This  would, however,  amountpro tanto, to an assumption either by the Government or by thetenant of the risks of the market, since conversion in 1929 canstrictly speaking,  only be  regarded  as a probability,, not ascertainty, and it would, therefore, constitute &amp;&quot; partially hiddenliability&quot; of a kind clearly discountenanced by the Conventiereport.    (t)  Payment in one of the existing  long term  Governmenlloans.  For instance,  Conversion Loan  might be used,  10Conversion Loan being payable for every  77&quot; of the capitalizeatenanfs  annuity, so as to  secure to  the landlord an income4  per cent.   This alternative would fully  meet the landlordneeds. From the  point of view-of Government finance, therenaturally  some objection to a procedure which involves  makinissues&quot; of Conversion Loan over  the  next six years or so atprice arbitrarily fixed in advance, but this objection is not perhapof the first importance.   Neither need we  be deterred  by th
 responding anomaly that the later the date of sale the larger ould be the capital value of the purchase money, owing to the regressive  appreciation which  may reasonably be  anticipated  the market value of the stock as compared with the arbitrary  ice of issue.  But the effect of the scheme upon the duration of the tenant purchasers  annuity  might  be very serious, sincethe rate at which the sinking fund would accumulate would vary according to the changing price  of the stock, with, in general, a steady tendency towards a slower  rate  of accumulation.  the duration  of  the   annuity was indeed   uncertain  under  theWyndham Act, but  here we should have an almost  definiteprospect of a considerable prolongation of the term.   This would clearly run  counter to  the provision made  in the Conventionreport that the  sinking fund  should  so  far  as  possible  be invested at  a uniform rate.  (c) Some compromise might conceivably be adopted, wherebypayment should be made partly in one type of security and partly in another, but after considering various alternatives We are unableto devise any satisfactory compromise of this kind.  16. The final decision as to the method of finance to be adoptedmust, to a  considerable extent, depend upon considerations ofgeneral financial policy which of necessity lie outside our purview,but we feel that the choice lies between War Loan  and a new41 per cent.  Stock.  17. This concludes  our main recommendations.  There are,however, a number  of minor points which deserve notice, and wedeal with these in the following paragraphs. In all other respectswe recommend that legislation  should follow the lines  of  theConvention  report and i the 1920 Bill, although certain drafting amendments will necessarily be required.  There are certain other points, such, for instance, as the subdivision of holdings and thelimitation of the  purchasers power to mortgage his holding,on which we have  received  evidence, but these appear  to  fall within the transferred powers of the Northern Government andare therefore outside our terms of reference.  18. Untenanted   Land. The  Convention  Sub-committee thought it impracticable to provide for the automatic sale of un-itnanted land outside the Congested District BoarcVs area.  TheyKommended,  however,  that  the existing powers  of  the Landlommission to  acquire untenanted land from the owner, whethersy agreement or compulsorily, should be retained,  and in certainispects extended.  These recommendations  were incorporatediClause 22 of the Bill of 1920.  There is some conflict of evidence is to whether the compulsory powers of the Land Commissioninder S. 43  and Part IV of the Act  of 1909, limited as they areothe purpose oi relieving congestion, are applicable to conditionsa Northern Ireland, but we think that it would be a mistake toipeal those powers,  and  we accordingly recommend  that, theinvention proposals should be adhered to, We think, however,  (11174)                                                  B
 that land which is held under a fee farm grant or long lease and occupied by the grantee or lessee and used as an ordinary farrJ though technically untenanted land, should not be liable  to tbl power of compulsory acquisition, and that the provisions of S. 1J (2) and (3) of the  1920 Bill in regard to the retention of holding for the purpose of  the relief of congestion, etc., should be modified Under the Act of 1909 the purchase money of untenanted land wai to be payable in cash ; but we consider that in future the paymeni should be made in stock as in the case  of tenanted land.   Else. where we recommend  that the power of  the Land Commission to  acquire untenanted land should include a power  to acquirj bog for resale to tenants.    19. Non-Judicial   Rents.- Judicial  rents  &apos;are  fair   rents fixed  under the Land  Law Acts either  by the court or  by ai agreement made between landlord  and tenant and  recorded witj the court.  They can thus be taken as standards representing thj annual value of the landlords interest in the holding.   They arl known as &quot; first-term,&quot;  &quot; second-term &quot; and &quot; third-term &quot; rents] according as they were fixed before the 16th August, 1896, betweeJ the 15th August, 1896, and the 16th August,  1911, and  after tM 15th August,  1911.  The  automatic fixation of price propose! by  the Convention is  based  upon judicial rents.   Non-judicial rents, on the other hand, are purely contractual rents and cannol be  taken as standards  for the fixation of price.  In  order tcl obtain a proper standard in such cases the Convention proposed! that the Land Commission should fix a fair rent and  that til price should  be calculated on the basis of such fair rent as if ill were a third-term judicial rent.   This would have imposed ail extremely onerous duty upon the  Land Commission and  woulihave delayed the completion of sales.  In many cases the partie!would be content that the actual non-judicial rent should be treated! as a judicial  rent  for the purpose of the sale, and in such case!the fixing of  an ad hoc fair  rent  would be  quite  unnecessary!We recommend, therefore, that in the absence of objection  either! by  landlord  or tenant,  non-judicial rents should be treated aJsecond-term judicial rents and that, blithe  event  of  objectioJbeing taken by either party, the Land Commission should fix a fail rent in the manner proposed by the Convention, subject, howeverl to appeal by either party to the Judicial Commissioner. ApparentlJin certain cases, especially during the war, judicial rents have beeifixed  by . agreement but through  some  fatality the agreemeiilhas not been recorded with the Land Commission.  The recordinlof agreements is  regulated by  rules  of the  Land Commissiorlwhich- provide that the agreement must be lodged within a montlafter its date,  and is to be recorded at the expiration of threlmonths from its  lodgment in the absence  of  objection.  Wlconsider that these cases would best be met by some modificaticlof the existing rules  which would admit of such agreement!being, now lodged, notwithstanding Chat the  time, for lodgmerl
  ,, jjaye expired of that other formalities may not have been complied  with.  In this connection,  Clause 20 of the 1920 Bill-provide  for the termination of the fixing of fair rents undervne Land  Law Acts.   This has now become a transferred service,but we suggest that, if possible, a similar  provision should beincluded in any new land purchase bill.  20,  Turbary-This is a point to which tenants attach greatimportance, as in some  districts they  are dependent for fuelupon adjoining bogs owned by the landlord, and negotiations forsale have  not infrequently broken down owing to disagreement asto the terms upon which the purchaser should acquire rights ofturbary.  The existing Acts secure to the tenant any rights and privileges  of turbary which he enjoyed prior to the sale, either asregards bog on his own holding or the holding of another tenant,or as regards bog belonging to the landlord over which he exercisedrights of  turbary,  either individually or  in  common  with othertenants.  The Land Commission  has power to define such rightsand to regulate their exercise, including power to vest the bog intrustees for the benefit of the tenants, and Clause 24 of the Bill of1920 proposed  some extension of these  powers.  Provision has,however, not yet been made for cases where the tenants, thoughdependent upon a neighbouring  bog, have no turbary rights of privileges  over it, except such right to cut turf as the owner may from time to time grant them upon his own terms.  We weregiven to understand  that in some such, cases the holdings wouldhe of small value to the tenants unless turbary rights were securedlo them over the bog in the future.  To meet  this difficulty werecommend that the Land Commission should be empowered toacquire compulsorily any bog the property of the vendor, resort to which  is necessary to the tenant purchaser of an  adjacentholding, and to make any appropriate regulations for the same purpose.  So far as purchase by  agreement  is concerned, thepowers proposed by Clause 22 (1) of the Bill of 1920 would havebeen sufficient,  but we think that this provision should be furtherextended so as  to authorise compulsory purchase.  21. Mineral Rights. Under Section 13 of the Irish Land Act,1903, the exclusive right of mining and taking minerals and diggingw searching for minerals, subject to certain specified exceptions,passes on  the sale of land&apos;to--the Land  Commission.  If at anylime after such transfer the mineral rights are let, leased, sold ordemised by the Commission, the vendor, or other person entitledthereto, receives  25 per cent, of any rent, purchase money orother net profit derived by the Land Commission from the rights,unless the Commission has purchased the interest of  the personentitled to this percentage.   These provisions of the Act do not affect any mine or quarry which is being worked or developed bythe vendor at the time  of the sale, or any mineral rights whichare not in the possession or enjoyment of the vendor at  the timeof sale.  Various proposals have been  placed before  us, which,
while differing somewhat in detail,  have generally the aim;reserving to the  landlord his interest in all minerals (exceptjjstone, gravel, clay and sand) either being worked at the datedSale of the land, or which, having been worked prior to that danhave been temporarily abandoned.  On the whole, we think Msome alteration of the provisions of  the Act of 1903 is  justifjJand we accordingly recommend that, in- addition to the minetJrights reserved to the vendor under  that Act, all mineral rigM(except stone, gravel, sand or clay)  should remain,the  vendor]property if shown to the satisfaction of the Land Commission ifpossess  a substantial value whether  potential or actual.    22. Sporting Rights. The Convention Sub-Committee recoiilmended  that upon the sale  of tenanted land  rights of  shootishould pass to the tenants or the Land Commissidn as  the caimight be, unless  by agreement  between landlords and teiiautlthose rights were retained by the landlord.    Fishing rights, Ithe  other hand,  were to be  reserved to the landlord upon i,application  and he was to have the right to retain or dispose Jthem together with all necessary rights of access for the purpolof fishing;  failing his exercising this privilege the fishing righlwere to be retained by the Land Commission when they were ifopinion that the preservation of such rights would conduce!the national interest.   We have received various suggestions IIIa modification of these terms in the interest of tenant or landlorlbut we  do not think it  would be wise to depart from  the Colvention proposals.    23. Advances to Owners of Estates.- We have already refenJin paragraph 13 of our report to the difficulties of the landlonfof  encumbered  estates.    In  connection  with these difficult^S. 3  of  the Act  of  1903 provided  that the  Land  CommissiJmight purchase any  demesne or other land in  the occupatiJof the landlord and might resell the whole or any portion of fland to him.  The Convention recommended that this provisklshould be continued  and we agree.  Payment in such caslshould be made in stock, as recommended by the Convention. \    24. Particulars  to be furnished by Owners. The ConventiJSub-Committee recommended that landlords should  be  requirlbefore the appointed day to lodge with the Land  Commissilcopies of such documents (schedules of tenancies, copies of rentalmaps, etc.) as might be required under statutory rules.   TheBlof 1920 provided that landlords  were to furnish in writing sillparticulars with respect  to the land in such form and verified such  manner as the Land Commission might by notice requijThe ability  of the  Land Commission to carry out the scheme!compulsory purchase we have recommended  will depend tip!their being  furnished with all requisite  particulars of the lailwith which  they are to deal   We consider it essential  that IIparticulars to be furnished should include not only schedules!tenancies and areas,  but also maps,  muniments of title and fother necessary documents.   The 1920 Bill, as  drafted, mil
I be held not to include the  lodgment of maps  and we think itIdesirable  that this requirement should be made quite definite ;in future legislation.f  25. Date when Act  is to take  effect. The Convention  Sub- Committee recommended that the automatic  transfer of  land should operate as from an  appointed day, not more than three years after the passing of  the Act.  This postponement was suggested mainly  in order  to give the Land Commission an interval in which to prepare for the working of the new scheme and to  dispose of pending  cases.   The  1920 Bill adopted this maximum period, but added a minimum one, by providing that the appointed  day  should  be not less than  two years and six months after the passing  of the Act.  This was apparently done as giving an interval during which voluntary sales might be concluded and  pending transactions completed, but we do not think such  an interval would now serve any useful purpose. In our view,  compulsory  purchase should be  brought  into operation  at the earliest possible moment  so soon as the Land Commission can make the necessary arrangements.   26. Compensation to  Vendors  in respect of Depreciation of 3 per cent Stock. The Convention  Sub-Committee recommended that, in the case of uncompleted  sales under the Act of 1909, the landlord should  be paid so much 3 per cent. Stock, at the actual market price prevailing at  the date of  signature of the agreement to sell,  as might  be proved to the satisfaction of the Land Commission to be required (over and above the cash bonus where the landlord was the absolute owner) to pay off charges existing at the  date of the  agreement and still existing  at the date of payment.   This recommendation was  embodied in. S.5 of the 1920 Bill.   The matter appears to fall outside our terms of reference and may have  lost a  good deal  of its importance, but  we think  we  ought to draw  attention to the point.  27. Costs of Sale. The landlords&apos;  representatives raised the point as to the heavy burden  imposed upon them by the costs of sale, and suggested that these costs, not exceeding 5 per cent. on the purchase  money, should be borne by  the State.   This proposal would in effect amount to an increase  in  the bonus and we are unable  to  recommend  it, nor do we think that the landlords would desire to press it  if the  Convention terms  were generally adhered to.  28.  We wish to express our great indebtedness to our Secretary,Mr. G. Ismay, whose services have been invaluable to us through-out our proceedings.
