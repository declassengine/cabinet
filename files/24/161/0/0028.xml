CIRCULATED TO THE - CABINET,Your Excellency: -     It is now seven weeks since the German governmentin their note.of June 7th submitted to the Powers freshproposals . for-settling the problem of reparations.  Themain points in the.note were three:-  (1)  A proposalto submit to independent enquiry the.question ofGermany&apos;s capacity to pay, coupled with an undertaking to accept any decision so reached as regards both theamount and the mode of&apos;payment;  (2)  the assignmentof certain specified guarantees as securities for pay-ment;  and: (3) the.summoning of a conference in orderto work out a detailed scheme.    .&apos; His Maiesty&apos;s Government were: from, the start of opinion that, whether these proposals/were adequateor not, they were at.least deserving of.careful con-sideration and were entitled to the courtesy of a reply.This view.was concurred in by .the Italian government;but the French and the&apos;Belgian governments expressedthe view that, only after .passive resistance had been definitely abandoned, by-Germany, would it be possibleto. consider her proposals.  . In their anxiety toascertain the precise meaning to be attached to this..condition, a number of questions were addressed to. theFrench and Belgian.governments by His Majesty&apos;s govern-ment with regard both to the action which the Germangovernment was.invited to take, and to the future position  APT&apos; COVERING NOTE&apos; TO THE FRENCH, ITALIANBELGIAN AND JAPANESE AMBASSADORS.&apos; FOREIGN OFFICE,    July      1923.
position in the Ruhr, if and when it should, have -beentaken,   The replies that have been returned to thesequestions have not completely.lifted the veil of un-certainty in which the situation is still in.parts in-volved.      In the meantime the question of reparations re-mains in suspense, and while reasons for inaction orfor refusal to take any action but that which commendsitself to this or that Power abound,the international situation becomes weekly and Indeed daily more acute;the occupation of the Ruhr, whether justified or notin its conception, fails to produce the desired effect;                                                            !allied unity on any adequate scale is strained;  payments by Germany are not forthcoming0   Moreover the steadydeterioration of German currency renders it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for her to meet herliabilities under the Schedule of payments fixed in May1921.   It is not denied that German policy has con-tributed largely to create this situation,  . But it is&quot;with the results even more than with the causes that weare now concerned, and it is to these that His Majesty&apos;sgovernment venture to direct the attention of their allies.      The view was put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government  ]jat the Paris conference in January last and is still held by.them that in order to obtain from Germany thepayments which the allies are entitled to receive, Germancredit must be re-established.   German currency must be.: ;:stabilised,, the German budget must be balanced, andGerman productivity must be encouraged.-.  As long as the                                                    most
most highly developed area of German-industrial liferemains under military rule,, and is made the scene ofpolitical agitation, it is difficult to&apos;see how the -economic problem can be solved..   It may be possible tobreak Germany&apos;s. power of resistance by such means; but itwill be at the price of that very recovery upon which theallied policy depends for its ultimate success.      If it be the case that the so-called passive re-assistance of Germany is the main obstacle that stands inthe Way of that consummation, and if its abandonmentwill be the first step towards a positive advance, HisMajesty&apos;s government are quite prepared to join their.allies in pressing such a policy, aB indeed they have al-ready pressed it upon the German government, and in the ;proposed draft of a joint allied reply to the German note of June 7th which they have the honour herewith to.submit the suggestion has been definitely put forward.  But ifthis plan is to be pursued with real hope of success, it.would appear that two conditions will require to be simultaneously satisfied.  The first is that a renewed and serious attempt should be made to deal with the questionof reparations by determining, not the liability of  ;Germany -^for that has already been laid down * but hercapacity to -pay.   The second is that proposals shouldbe made for the restoration of the Ruhr to that condition which will enable it to become an area of fruitful pro-duction, rather than one of international strife.     &apos; As regards the first of these steps,, it will-beacknowledged that the reparation figure laid down in1921 no longer corresponds to the realities of the situa--tiony&apos;   Fresh calculations must sooner or later be madeu                                                    It
AsIt is in the best interest of the allies that, whateverfigure ho finally decided upon, it should he freelyaccepted by the German government as just and realisable.Furthermore the situation is&apos; likely not to grow better,but to become worse with delay,  A recurrence to procedure-ure by ultimatums-may Indeed produce tardy and reluctantcapitulation..  ... It fails to produce substantial de-liveries either in cash or kind.      The German government have proposed in their recentnote to allow Germany&apos;s capacity to pay, as well as themode of payment,  to be investigated by an impartial body,In the draft reply which is enclosed.herewith we have pointed out that such a procedure does not necessarilyconflict with any provisions of the Treaty of Versailles.Under article 234, a reduction of the total amount de-clared by the Reparation Commission to be payable, byGermany can be made, if explicitly authorised by theseveral governments represented on the Commission.There is nothing to prevent those governments,, or the &apos;Reparation Commission on which they are represented,from calling Into: council such Impartial and expertassistance as they may desire.. Fortified by suchauthority, the Commission and the.governments would bein a position to demand from the German government,who under- the terms of the treaty would have had aright to be, heard, the unequivocal fulfilment of theundertaking contained in the German note.
     As to the composition of such an enquiry, this isa matter which could, well he determined by the Alliedgovernments in consultation.   There should be no difflculty in agreeing upon a selection of competent personsenjoying their confidence, as well as that of thepublic.   Further, having regard to the important in-terest which American finance is bound to take in anycomprehensive plan of settlement, the advantage of american co-operation, whether in an official or in an unofficial capacity, scarcely requires emphasis, and isconfidently recommended by His Majesty&apos;s Government toher Allies.     Should His Majesty&apos;s Government be so fortunateas to carry with them the assent of their Allies thusfar, they will be ready without delay to enter into amore detailed discussion of the precise steps to besuccessively taken in order to carry out this plan ofaction.   In such a discussion the question of Inter-Allied indebtedness will necessarily occupy a prominentplace, and will be approached by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the spirit of generosity which has inspiredtheir previous proposals in this direction.   They onljshrink from submitting more definite proposals nowbecause experience has shown that hard and fast schemes are apt to impede rather than to promote a generalagreement..     There remains the question, should the German gov-ernment accept the advice, with regard to cessationfrom passive resistance which it is proposed to tender                                                 to

HisMajesty&apos;s Government believe that the French and belgian governments will be the first to agree that thecharacter of the occupation should in&apos; those circum-stances undergo a swift and material change;:  that thenumbers of the military forces stationed in the Ruhrand at other places occupied since January last shouldbe reduced as rapidly  as possible to the minimum required to protect the civilian officials who may forsome time be obliged to stay in that region in orderto control the proper  administration of the pledgesand guarantees which Germany will have given;  and thatassurances of ultimate and complete&apos; evacuation,.whenthe necessary conditions have been fulfilled, should &apos; :not be withheld.   Simultaneously the various measures that have been promulgated in the name of the Rhine-land Commission for coercing the civil population andimpeding the free movement of persons and goods would doubtless be either cancelled or relaxed;  as generousan amnesty as possible would be accorded;  and the re-turn of the expelled population and functionaries wouldbe facilitated under suitable guarantees.     It has not been thought either necessary or desirable to Include in the draft reply to the Germangovernment the more precise indications which are con-tained in this despatch.   Attaching, as they do, thehighest importance to  the maintenance of Allied unity&apos;and convinced that only by such means will an earlysolution of the international problem be found&quot;, His                                        Majesty&apos;s
Majesty&apos;s Government have drawn up the draft reply in a spirit and in terms which they trust may be acceptable to their Allies.-     They will, of course&apos;, be glad to consider any suggestions or emendations which any of the latter may think fit to propose consistently with the main linesof policy which it has been the aim of His Majesty&quot;sGovernment to expound and to defend.     Should tho ilote meet with general favour, therewould appear to be manifest advantages in its earlydespatch.     The present communication, addressed to the Alliesalone,  has been added in order to acquaint them in greater detail with the plans which His Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment hope to be permitted to pursue in conjunctionwith them, and which may be thus resumed.  ,     (1)   A body of impartial experts to be set up,, so soon as passive resistance has ceased, charged with theduty of advising the Allied governments and theReparation Commission respectively as to Germany&apos;capacity to pay and as to the mode of payment to be prescribed. -  The co-operation of an American expert tobe sought, and arrangements to be made for German ex-perts to be consulted and heard,     (2)   The same body, or a body similarly consti-tuted,  to be asked to advise the Reparation commission as to the economic sureties and guarantees to bepledged by Germany to the Allies.
     (3)   Inter-Allied discussions to lie opened withas little delay as possible whether by conference orotherwise,  for the purpose of elaborating a comprehens-ive plan of a general and final financial settlement,covering the whole field both of reparations and of inter-Al1ied indebtedness.     (4)   Steps to be taken upon the cessation ofpassive resistance for the resumption of the civil administration of the Ruhr, and to provide for the progressive evacuation of those areas.

His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to submit theforegoing proposals to their Allies with the convic-tion that in the common interest positive action cannot longer safely be delayed, and in the hope that theymay help to facilitate a definite advance,                  I am, Sc.,          (Signed)       CURZON OF KSDLESTOM,
                                                 m 4            CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET.       DRAFT IDENTIC REPLY TO THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.     On May 2nd the German government,in response tosuggestions that had heen made, addressed an identicnote to the governments of the United States of,America,Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, and Japan, con-taining certain proposals for a settlement of thequestion of reparations.     To this note&apos; separate replies were returned bythe French and Belgian governments, acting in unison, -and by the Italian, British and Japanese governmentsacting separately.   These replies concurred, however,in regarding the German proposals-as inacceptable, themain criticism directed against them being that neitherthe -total amounts suggested as payable for reparation^.nor the mode of payment., nor the guarantees offered,were at all adequate, while settlement.of any kind wasmade contingent on the evacuation of the Ruhr, pending .which passive resistance by the Germans was not to berenounced.     The unfavourable reception accorded to theseproposals having led the German government to reconsiderits attitude, that government on June 7th addressed asecond communication to the same powers.     In this memorandum the German-government, affirmingonce again its determination to discharge its reparationdebt, repeated a proposal which it.had before made, torefer to an impartial international tribunal the questionboth of the amount and the methods of payment, undertook to furnish such a body with.all possible information and                                      assistance ...
assistance in conducting the investigation, and pro-promised to accept the decision at which it might arrive.Further, the German government proposed certainguarantees or sureties lor the regular payment of the liabilities thus fixed, involving, though this wasnot explicitly stated, the grant of a moratorium of four years from the present date.     Finally, the German government suggested aconference at which Germany might be assisted byoral discussion in arriving at a solution of allthese questions.     The German note did not on this occasion containany reference to the subject of passive resistance,not, it is presumed, from any failure to appreciateits peculiar importance, but because that topic hadnot been mentioned in all of the replies of theallied governments to which the note was intended asan answer.     The allied governments, anxious to terminate the phase equally of paper controversy and of inter-national complication, will now give their views uponeach of these matters.     In the treaty of Versailles, it was recognised by the allied and associated governments that,, whileaffirming the full responsibility of Germany forall the loss and damage which they had suffered ather hands during the war, they could not, in view ofher diminished resources, expect to receive from her complete reparation for all such loss and damage.In other words, the necessity was admitted even atthat date of adjusting the liability of Germany to                                         her ...
The ...her capacity to pay.     In May, 1921, the amount of reparation was fixed by the Reparation Commission at 132 milliards of goldmarks.   No power was given by the treaty to cancelany part of that obligation, except with the specificauthority of the several governments represented onthe Commission.   If therefore the contention is now put forward that owing to the altered circumstancesof today the figure of 1921 is too high and calls for reduction, it can only be by action within the framework of the treaty that such reduction can properly be made;  and it is only from this point ofview that the allied powers are free to consider thefirst request of the German government in the notenow under reply, namely,  the request for an examina-tion by international experts of her presentcapacity for payment.     The allied governments are far from thinking that they might not be assisted in the task devolvedupon them by the treaty by the labours of competentand impartial experts;  and provided that nothing is done in this respect that is inconsistent with thetreaty stipulations, they are disposed to think thatpositive advantage might result from such an examina-tion.   It would bring the allegations of diminishedcapacity to the test of fact;  it would reveal theactual position at the present moment;  and it would remove all further excuse for calculated evasion.
     The Allied Governments take note of the statement by the German government that it would welcome such an enquiry, and of its pledge to abide by the result.If a binding arrangement were entered into, concerningthe discharge of the. entire liability, as thusdetermined,  and. as to the sureties to be taken for  theregular and complete payment of the total debt, thecase for a further moratorium would emerge in a newperspective.     As to the sureties themselves, the Allied govern-ments, while appreciating the effort of the Germangovernment to advance beyond the vague indications  ofthe earlier note of May 2nd, must guard themselves from accepting these new proposals as adequately, orin the best,possible -way meeting the actual require-ments of the situation..   Their economic value mustlargely depend upon factors of which no mention ismade in the German note, such as the stabilization  ofthe mark and the balancing of the German budget.   a careful examination of these, or other supplementaryguarantees,  will be an inseparable feature of theenquiry which the Allied governments are preparedwithin the limits of the Treaty to initiate.     It mist be clear, however, that no guarantees  forthe punctual discharge of accepted liabilities will suffice, unless provision is at the same time made  forsome form of international control of German financialadrnini strati on.   This is one of the subjects towhich it will be necessary to invite the seriousattention of the German government, and without a                                    settlement   ...  .
settlement of which no final solution can he obtained.     When the German government pleads for oraldiscussion of all these matters, it may he rememberedthat, under the Treaty, the Reparation Commission whileauthorised from time^to time to consider the resources and capacity of Germany, is also under an obligation&quot;to give to the German government an opportunity  to be heard.&quot;   It is, not likely therefore that the Germancase will suffer from lack of suitable exposition.     Such is the reply of the Allied Governments  tothe main propositions of the German note.   there remains, however, one important consideration which isthe antecedent,condition to a willingness on the  partof the Allies to reopen the questions to which reference has.been made.   The occupation of the  Ruhrvalley by. the armed forces of certain of the allieshas been followed, by measures deliberately taken  bythe German.government to impede this policy and to delay the payment of reparations..   These measures maybe summed up in the familiar phrase &quot;passive resistance-tance.&quot;  , If the German government now desires a resumption of enquiry, it will, in the opinion of theAllied Governments, be well advised to withdraw withoutfurther delay the ordinances and decrees; which haveorganised and fomented this form of resistance, and.openly and unequivocally to disavow the acts of &apos;violence and sabotage Which: have in some casesaccompanied it.    -            &quot;     Were this action to be taken without delay,  notonly would it be regarded as an evidence of that  good                                           faith
faith which the German government has once  againavowed, hut it would render possible a reconsiderationby the occupying powers of the conditions of their occupation, and a gradual return to the normalfeatures of industrial life in the Ruhr.   Such areversion would possess the additional advantage that by re-establishing the productive activity  of that region, it would enable the German government morespeedily and more effectively to discharge  itsreparation debt.     In making this reply to the German note, theAllied Governments have clearly demonstrated theirearnest desire for the cessation of conflict and thepacification of Europe.   In return they feel thatthey have the right to invite the co-operation of theGerman government in the execution of this  policy;and they have indicated with as much precision as ispossible at the present stage the reciprocal steps bywhich each party can effectively contribute to the desired result.
