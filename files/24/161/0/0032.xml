Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.            A difference of opinion has arisen between the Foreign       Office and my Department in regard to the renewal of leases       to lot-holders of British. Concessions in China and I submit       the following statement for the consideration of the Cabinet.W Origin of the Concession Leases.Chinese Government  between 1851 and 1881,  that Britishsubjeots might form trading communities.   The land waspurPhased by H.M. Government,  the existing Chinese ownersreceiving the price, arid is held by H.M.  Government in perpetuity,  in accordance with the ordinary arrangementsgoverning the tenure of land in China,  i.e., land tax is paid by H.M. Government just as it 1B paid by any otherholder of land,  The Concessions are, therefore,ordinary perpetual  leases.     The Concession lota were sold by auction byH.M. Government to  British traders, under 99 year leases,with a nominal ground rent.  The original holders, therefore,,bought a leasehold  interest at leasehold  prioes and whenever they disposed of their Interest, they did so at the thenmarket value of the remainder of their interest.These seven ConeIon Areas were granted by the
          The  Crown Advocate advisee  that  at  the expiration of     the 99 year  leases,  the buildings  erected revert to     H.M. Government  as landlords.ThyuestloP of Renewals.     arose out of on  application made in 1909 by the Chartered     Bank of Tientsin, who  asked what terms  the Government     would require for renewal.  A Committee, appointed by the     Treasury, advised that renewals  should  be granted for a     further 99 years for a consideration  (annual rental) baaed     on the value of  the  land  and  property at the time of     renewal.   Owing  to various  objeotions by F.O. representatives     and lot-holders, the Committee was reconstituted, and the     majority  reported that there  was no objection to a term of     999 years instead of 99 years.  As to the annual rent, a     ooncession might be  made  on grounds of  policy by reducing     the factor of buildings *   The method  was to be one of loading     the land  values, in  rest - t of existing or possible  buildings,     by fixed  and moderate  amounta.  In the  result, the     Treasury  deoided (with some hesitation,  as they thought     the proposals too favourable  to  the lot-holders) to  take     as the basis of  the  annual  sum,  the market value of  the     Bite, loaded by  the  addition  of  a  sum based on only  one half     of the value of  the  buildings. !fog opposition  to  the  scheme.          The  proposals were  explained  to  the lot-holders, and     have generally met with  aoceptanoe.  The opposition  centres     round a email but active  minority  of  lot-holders at     Tientsin, whose  opposition waB prompted by certain events     connected with  local politios.  This  opposition represents     only eijfi  of  the  total  lots;  of  the remainder, the holders     of 64$ have  agreed  to  the scheme.   The  opposing lot-holders     have asked for  a renewal  of their  leases on purely nominal     terms.
     at less than freehold price;  to this extent their position     Is better than that of holders in the other Concessions. iirmmry of arguments.       (i)  The lot-holders have bought a leasehold interest;     if they want practical freehold they ahould pay freehold     price.  As it is, they are offered 999 years at less than     the market price.       (ii)  The opposing lot-holders claim that there was no     original intention to make a profit out of the Concessions.     This ic disproved by the fuot that the lots were sold     originally by auction to the highest bidders, and the     Treasury archives show clearly that the Government made the     beat bargains possible.       (iii)  They claim that the aucoesa and value of the     Concessions are due to their efforts.  But like all other     British subjects domiciled abroad they pay no contribution     to the Exchequer and enjoy the care of the Government for     their general interests.       (;iv)  They claim that they are being treated worse than     the nationals of other Concessions, whose Governments have     given freehold tenure.  But whether or no, in the foreign     Concessions, the lota were given by the Governments to their     ^nationals without charge, the faot ia clear that lots in     those Conceosions can only be obtained at freehold prices     and that the present holders must have paid such a price.-     In the British Concessions, the lot-holders have paid lease-     hold prices, and the present holders have acquired them from     other lot-holders at leasehold prices.  They oan get freehold
  (v)  The  question  of polioy,  and, in particular,  of extraterritorially has been  raised.   It is on this  ground and not,it is understood, on legal  or  equitable  grounds,  that theF,0. oppose the scheme.   They  argue that the scheme islikely to re-act  disastrously  on the  whole extra-territorialsystem.  But what has been  the actual effeot of theGovernment  Soheme, as promulgated and known during  the pastIS years, on the  Chinese and other foreign Powers?   NoChinese  criticism has actually emerged,  although  theGovernment  proposals have reoeive wide publicity  in China,                              *The Chinese Government and  other Powers  are, therefore, quite .aware of the exact position, and, If  the Government proposals had contained  any material  for oritioism or complaint, itis reasonable  to  assume  that it would already have  beenforthcoming,    Further,It  is not seen how the leases are  closely related  to  extra-territorial privileges.  Municipal and consular jurisdictions  are, of course, extra-territorialprivileges, but  the  Government leases of the concessionareas  are not  different  in  oharaoter  from their leases of consular sites  and  compounds,  and from all other  foreignholdings.   The land is held In the same way as  land generally in China, and  the Chinese Government  has never  regardedtraffic  in  these holdings as an exploitation.  It seems dearthat the Chinese Government knows and recognises  theexisting lease system as an affair of Ordinary  business and not  of  policy.
oncluaiono.       -(a)    A large number of applications for renewals have            been received, and, if E*MS Government uphold their            approved soheme, the majority will follow.  The            total of these applications represents property            valued at over ^3,000,000.        (b)    The value of the concessions ao a whole-may, be            taken at  3,000,000.  The annual rental whioh WOTLL4,            be derived, assuming that all holdings are renewed            within the next few years, would be about  40,000.            It will be seen, therefore, that the financial            interests, from the standpoint of the Exchequer are            far from negligible.                              KI                                        J. B.                                      20/7/2 &apos;6.
