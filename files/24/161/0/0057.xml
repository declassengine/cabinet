[This  Document  is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government. ]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  July 1923SECRET.N.D.  (R)  14.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.NATIONAL AND IMPERIAL  DEFENCE  COMMITTEE.Sub-Committee on Relations between the Navy and the Air  Force.SUMMARY OF THE  EVIDENCE  GIVEN BY VARIOUS  NAVAL AND  AIR FORCE OFFICERS    BEFORE THE STTB-COMMITTEE ON THE RELATIONS  BETWEEN THE NAVY AND THE    AIR FORCE.    THE following summary is based on the evidence which  has been  given beforethe Sub-Committee.   It is intended to be a simple statement of the facts which havebeen brought out in the evidence, and does not attempt to arrive at any conclusions which may be drawn from this evidence.    For the purpose of convenience the summary is divided into the following  main headings:     (A.) The system of  co-operation between the Air Force and the Navy as it exists          at present.    (B.) The  Naval objections  to  the  present system,  and  the  Air Ministry&apos;s          comments on those objections.    (C.)-The organisation which is proposed by the Navy for  a Naval Air arm.    (D.)-The Air Staffs  objections to (C) (the organisation proposed by the Navy).   (A.) THE SYSTEM OF CO-OPERATION BETWEEN  THE AIR FORCE              AND  THE NAVY AS IT EXISTS  AT PRESENT.Design and Research Work.    1. New design, experimental  and research work are carried out  by the AirMinistry, but Naval requirements are carried out after consultation with the Admiralty.The Admiralty, after  consultation between  the two  Departments, put forward their suggestions  as to  the types of machines which they require and the Air Ministrydesign such machines, as far as is practicable from the point of view of aerodynamicsand similar technical considerations, in accordance  with these requirements.  The AirMinistry draw  up the  specification of the type required  and call for designs from thetrade, and the Admiralty are kept fully informed of the progress made during thewhole process  and after the trials have been carried out.    2. This practice  differs  from  that employed  in connection with the machinessupplied for co-operation with the Army.  In the latter case  the War Office indicate to the Air Ministry the nature  and extent  of the work which it is desired that theAir  Force should  carry out, and the Air Ministry then select  the type of machinewhich is considered by them to be the most suitable.   &apos; 3. The Navy are not directly represented on the  design, experimental or researchbranches at the Air Ministry, but the Air Ministry utilise the  services of a certainnumber of ex-Naval officers, who have now transferred to the Air Force, in these(Prepared in the Secretariat.)[10330]B
mDepartments, and also  receive reports as to defects  in  design and  performance of machines from Air&apos;force officers&apos; serving with Naval Air units, to which due weight isattached in the modification and improvement of design.     4. There is also in  existence an Inter-Departmental Committee called  &quot;The Joint&quot; Technical Committee on  Aviation  Arrangements in His Majesty&apos;s ships&quot; whichconsists of representatives of the Admiralty and the Air Ministry.     5. The functions of this Committee are to examine the technical  problems whichmay  arise  with  regard  to the suitability  of the types of  aircraft intended forembarkation on  &quot; carriers &quot; and the  modifications  and improvements which  can beeffected on  the &quot;carriers&quot; themselves.---It-would  presumably, if required, also  dealwith the  problems arising  out of  the embarkation of machines  on ships other thanAircraft Carriers.                                       .          ..     L,     6.  It is clear from  the  evidence that new types of aircraft^can be proposed either by the Admiralty or the Air Ministry,  and that the latter  give full consideration to allsuggestions which may  be put forward by the Navy.The  Supply of Materiel.     7.  At  present  the Air  Ministry are solely responsible  for the supply of allraiateriel  connected  with aircraft.   An establishment of the  machines  required for 30-operatiofowith the Navy has been agreed upon between the Admiralty and the Mr Ministry, and the latter is responsible for maintaining that establishment at full strength with its correct  proportion of machines  in reserve, the necessary spare parts and the various shore establishments required for its maintenance.  This establishmentis at present limited by the number  of Aircraft Carriers in commission in the Navy,but the Air Ministry have  made the necessary arrangements in their programme of construction to  increase  the number of machines  up to the  number&quot; which will. berequired when the two  new Aircraft Carriers are completed ID. 1923-24.      8. Provision does  not appear  to  be  contemplated at present  of a reserve of those machines which in time of  war would be carried  by individual capital ships, cruisers and light cruisers, and, in the event of an emergency arising in the immediate future, the&apos; Fleet would not be  supplied with  any aircraft -other than  those carried in the Aircraft Carriers.      9. A point which  should be borne in mind  is  that  the  cost of  the  aircraft, &amp;c, supplied for co-operation  with  the  Navy is  borne entirely  by the  Air Ministry, and that the Admiralty make no contribution from their own expenditure.      10.  It is desirable to quote the following extracts from the  evidence of  the Chief of the Air Staff (paragraphs 7 to 9, 3rd Meeting&apos; :-          &quot; I will now  describe briefly the responsibilities as  between the Admiralty      &quot; and Air Ministry in  the way of determining the number Of Units required for      &quot; co-operation  with the  Navy,  whether  for flying  off carriers  or working  from      &quot; shore bases.          &quot; I think 1 should first go back to a statement  in an Admiralty letter,  dated      &quot; the  27th September, 1918 (reference M. 022454), in which  the  following passage      &quot; occurred:                &quot; &apos; Constitutionally  it  is for the Admiralty to frame  demands for what          &quot; &apos; they consider an adequate  air service contingent,  with the Navy with the          &quot; ! expectation that it will be fulfilled, or, if this is  not possible, it will only          &quot; &apos; be modified with Admiralty approval and, if necessary, after reference to          &quot; &apos; the Cabinet.&apos;         : &quot; This position was restated in a letter sent to  the  Air Ministry more than      &quot; a year  later, the 20th -November, 1919  (M.  04768)   To this letter the Air      &quot; Ministry replied on the 22nd November, 1919, as  follows:                &quot;  &apos; The  Air  Council desire me to say that  they fully accept  the statement.           &quot; &apos; of principle laid down by the Lords  Commissioners of  the  Admiralty as           &quot;. &apos; a description  of the procedure to be followed in framing the  Air Estimates         -  &quot; &apos; for future years.&apos;           &quot; There has been no change of attitude on  the part of  the  Air Ministry since       &quot; that date.
         &quot;For example, in November 1920, the  Admiralty put forward proposals for    &quot; aircraft supply for Naval purposes up to the end of  1922 (reference M. 02731).    &quot; These were followed by  discussions between the two staffs, as  a result of which  :. .&quot; the Air Ministry, on  the  12th March, 1921 (S. 14047), formally  notified their    &quot; general agreement subject to certain modifications due to conditions which had    &quot; changed since the Admiralty&apos;s proposals were drawn up.   This was, in fact,&apos;an    &quot; agreed letter, and the Admiralty replied on the 29th March concurring generally    &quot; in the Air Ministrys proposals.         &quot; It was on  this basis  we were working when, in the summer of  1921, the    &quot; Cabinet issued, directions  applying to all Departments that a cut of 20 per cent.    &quot; must, be made  all round  on  the.  basis of  the expenditure for  the then financial    &quot; year (1921-22).  &apos;.,         &quot; This necessitated the Air Ministry approaching the Admiralty to ask for    &quot; their  assistance for suggestions  as to  how the decrease, in so  far  as Naval    &quot; provisions had to be altered,  should be  effected.  The provision  as  agreed    &quot; between the Admiralty and Air Ministry had  contemplated&apos; additions  to Naval    &quot; air strength in  1922-23, and  the  Air  Ministry  had  therefore to get this    &quot; 20 per cent,  cut and at  the same time  provide more for Naval air than  before.    &quot; We had to ask the Admiralty to agree to some deductions from the additional    &quot; provision.  Here, again, we were  able,, as  a  result of discussions between  the    &quot; staffs,  to come  to an agreement with  the Admiralty.   They put  up  certain    &quot; modifications from  their  original  programme, and we undertook  to make    &quot; provision accordingly,   On -top of the 20 per cent, cut came the appointment of    &quot; the Geddes Committee, which aimed at getting further large cuts in expenditure-,    &quot; and recommended among other things  that the number of squadrons working    &quot; with the Fleet at home should be reduced from five to one.   We succeeded in    &quot; holding out  against this recommendation  and in maintaining the equivalent of    &quot;roughly four squadrons for  work with the Navy  at home.   Here,  again, the    &quot;Admiralty,  while viewing as they said with great,- misgiving&apos; the reductions    &apos;&apos; required, recognised that&apos;  our proposals were the best that could  be devised in    &quot; view of the  heavy reductions which had  been  imposed on the Air Ministry, as    &quot; on the other Fighting Departments, by His Majesty&apos;s Government.           *             *&apos;--.            *             *             *         &quot; To pass now to the  financial year 1923-24 ; here the position has been that    &quot; the Admiralty  notified  us in detail  of their  requirements  in August 1922.    &quot; These requirements were  accepted in full by the Air Ministry, and provision is    &quot; being made accordingly  and the necessary sums provided in the Air Estimates.    &quot; The Admiralty suggest  that  under the  present arrangements  they may build    &quot; carriers, but have no assurance that there will be aircraft to put in them when    &quot; they are built.  This may be  theoretically possible,  but  up to the present  the    &quot; provision of  aircraft has, in fact, been ahead of the completion of carriers.         &quot;The position thus is  that by the end of  this year  the amount of aircraft    &quot; will be sufficient to  fill  the carriers and to have sufficient reserve to keep them    &quot; up  to  strength.   We  shall not have available machines for flying from  the    &quot; turrets of battleships, and  this is not wanted this-year.  The reason for this is    &quot; that the Admiralty have considered other requirements  as of more immediate    &quot; importance for the  moment in view of  financial conditions and of the present    &quot; state of air  developments in other  Navies.   They have, therefore, left this    &quot; provision to  another year..   We had a letter quite recently to that  effect.&quot;Supply  of  Personnel.    11.  The Air Ministry are responsible for the  supply of officers and other ranks for duty with the Naval Air wing, with the exception of certain Naval officers who  areemployed as observers in &quot;spotting&quot; machines.   The numbers of Royal  Air force personnel  at present  employed   on  work directly in connection with  the Navy is115 officers and 681 other ranks.    12.  Up  to the present there have  been a certain number of  Royal  Air force officers, with previous naval experience, who have  been employed on work in connectionwith the Navy, but these numbers will  gradually diminish as time goes on.  Thesupply of officers to-meet future demands is,divided into two classes:     (a.) Officers holding permanent Commissions ; and    (b.)  Officers holding short  service Commissions,and the system is as follows :-      [10330]                                                         B 2
     13. (a.)  Officers on leaving Cranwell are given the choice of the particular branchin which they wish  to specialise.   Those selecting  the Navy side will, in the firstinstance, do four years  with the Navy.  They may then serve with  other branches(including courses of instruction) for a term of years in order to gain wider experience,but will ultimately return to the Naval  side again.   Such a practice will ensure thatthere will always be a proportion of senior officers in the  Royal Air  Force with Navalexperience.     14. (6.)  A proportion of the officers holding short service Commissions  for fiveyears, who,  after receiving their initial training  of one year,  are  posted for duty withthe Naval Service, and do the whole of their service with that branch.   On completionof their five years&apos; service they are posted to the Reserve for five years, where  they areearmarked as  reserves for the Naval arm in case of emergency.     15.  The Air Ministry  draft all personnel to the Fleet Air units  and can post awayofficers or  men to other branches of the Air Force either on promotion or for other causes which appear to be  desirable to the Air Staff.     The Air Ministry endeavour to  retain  the  personnel with the Fleet Air units forthe normal term of service  (ie., four years), but  exceptional  cases do arise when it isimpossible to  allow them to remain for the whole of that period.     10.  The detailed establishments of personnel are  settled  by the Air Ministry afterthe number of machines and the organisation  required have  been agreed upon withthe Admiralty.     Owing to the technical development and the  improvement in types of machinesit has not been possible to  lay down any fixed establishment, since different types may require different classes of personnel.Training.     17.  The Air Force  is  responsible for the  training of all personnel, both officersand men, for duty with the Navy.  The original training is carried  out at the ordinaryAir Force establishments which exist for the purpose of training  the personnel of theAir Force as a whole.     18.  Further specialist training  in  Naval  matters is superimposed later  at thespecial aerodromes which are maintained for those units co-operating with the navy and at various technical schools which are maintained  for the  purpose.     19.  These special &quot; Naval &quot;  aerodromes and the technical schools for Naval work are under the command of the Air Officer commanding the Coastal Area.  This officer is at present an ex-Naval officer.     20.  Training is also of course carried out continually in the units themselves.     The system of training is described in more  detail by the Chief of the Air Staffin the following extract (paragraphs 48-51), -&quot;ird  Meeting):          &quot;  Generally speaking, when units are not required by the Commander-in-chief     &quot; for  exercises either  from  carriers or from  shore bases, they  are engaged in     &quot; training under the direction of the Coastal Area.  The training  is arranged on     &quot; the system that all officers carry out a  course  of ground and  aerial gunnery     &quot; every year;  they also go twice a year to a  syllabus of  instruction in naval  air     &quot; co-operation, which  includes such  subjects as signals,  wireless  telegraphy, fleet     &quot; formations and tactics, ship recognition,  range  and bearing-finding, air naviga-     &quot; tion  and pilotage and naval routine and  etiquette.   Apart from  training in the     &quot; operational units, there are also small units maintained  for  higher training in     &quot; fleet work. I will describe briefly what there are : There is a six months&apos; course      &quot; in marine observing at Lee-on-Solent; there is  also  a three months&apos; course in      &quot; air pilotage, which is carried out at Calshot.  This is to teach pilots to navigate      &quot; out  of sight of  land,  and includes  advanced instruction  in instruments,      &quot; compasses, map-reading, &amp;c.   Then there is a seaplane training course  of three      &quot; months&apos; duration, also at  Calshot, for candidates who &apos;have already qualified in      &quot; the air as pilots  on land  machines to learn to fly seaplanes,  flying-boats and      &quot; amphibians.   At Gosport there  is a torpedo training establishment where all      &quot; pilots of the torpedo flights undergo a six months&apos; course in the work of  torpedo-      &quot; running  from  aircraft and learn the strategy and tactics  of  the  torpedo      &quot; squadrons.  For the actual work of  stripping and assembling the torpedo itself      &quot; we  send our pupils to the Naval  Torpedo School in  H.M.S. &apos; Vernon,&apos; where we
    &quot; also send fitters specialised in this sort of work.   Training in deck-landing is    &quot; first  carried out  on a marked-out  deck on  an aerodrome,  and, as  soon  as    &quot; proficient, pilots undergo actual  practice in the &apos; Argus.&apos;   We should  he glad    &quot; of fuller opportunities for training  pilots  from a carrier itself,  and hope they    &quot; will be afforded when the number of carriers in commission increases.   I hope    &quot; the Committee will  realise that these  Naval Air  units and specialised naval    &quot; training establishments could not function unless they had  behind them the    &quot; trained resources of units  outside the Coastal Area.  These latter supply the    &quot; Coastal  Area  with  personnel ready trained, for  example, in flying  training    &quot; up to the knowledge of service  types, aerial gunnery and bombing instruction,    &quot; for which  the. school  at  Eastchurch  serves  the whole   Royal Air  Force,    &quot; photography instruction taught at Farnborough,  technical  training  of  airmen    &quot; taught at Halton  and Manston,  and  store and repair depots, which, again, serve    &quot;not  only  Naval   but  all  other  units   in  the  Royal   Air   Force.   The    &quot; Committee will see from what I  have said that responsibility for general lines of    &quot; training rests with the Air Ministry,  and  the Air Ministry are also responsible    &quot; for the issue of training manuals required by the Naval Air units.   I would just    &quot; like to read out a definite answer to Naval Question 4, because it is a  point you    &quot; made just now.  &apos; Has the Navy any shore aeroplane or seaplane stations either    &quot;&apos;for  service or training purposes?&apos;  The  Navy  has no   shore aeroplane  or    &quot; seaplane stations  for service   or training  purposes, but  the Royal  Air Force    &quot; maintains the  following stations for the exclusive purpose of operations,  training    &quot; and  development for those units  allocated for Naval requirements.  Without    &quot; these stations  fleet aircraft would be unable to remain efficient for more than    &quot; a few weeks ; Leuchars : at Gosport  there is a base for fleet aircraft.  Immediate    &quot; reserve  aircraft are kept here,  and  major  repairs  are carried out.  Preparatory    &quot; intensive deck-flying training for pilots and continual  training  for observers    &quot; and  wireless  operators.  At  Gosport  a  torpedo  development  flight  is also    &quot; maintained, which works in close  touch  with H.M.S- &apos; Vernon.&apos;  Range-finding    &quot; and  D.C.B. control exercises in  conjunction with  His Majesty&apos;s  Signal School    &quot; and H.M.S. &apos; Excellent.&apos;   At Calshot there is a base for flying-boat operational    &quot; unit, pilots&apos; seaplane training and air pilotage course. Lee-on-Solent:  Observers&apos;    &quot; training school; reserve of float planes for embarkation in carriers when required.    &quot; Co-operation exercises  with H.M.S. &apos; Excellent.&apos;  Felixstowe,  Gattewater, department&apos;s-    &quot; bristle:  under care and maintenance parties.  Reserve aircraft are stored here.    &quot; Donibristle retains facilities for the embarkation - of ship planes in capital ships.    &quot; Overseas,  at  Malta  (Halfar  Aerodrome  and  Calafrana  Seaplane Station):    &quot; Aerodrome recently  constructed.  Base  for fleet  aircraft and seaplane opera-    &quot; tional unit.  Immediate reserve aircraft are kept  here and major repairs are    &quot; carried  out.  Behind the  above stations there are maintained  the following    &quot; training  and development stations,  not for the exclusive use of the Naval Air    &quot; units :  Gunnery and armament  training.  Eastchurch: School of Photography,    &quot; Farnborough:  Initial Flying Training (one year), iat  various  schools ;  Flying-    &quot; Boat  Development and Marine Research  generally,  Isle of Grain;  Electrical    &quot; and Wireless training, Flowerdown ;  Engineering Training, I^arnborough.  These    &quot; establishments are required to ensure that the personnel of the Naval Air units    &quot; are efficient and up-to-date, and to  provide an even distribution of technical    &quot; knowledge.  It is essential that personnel posted to Naval Air units should    &quot; undergo these courses from time to time, and these establishments must  exist if    &quot; duplication is to be avoided, and the Naval Air personnel is  to  be kept in touch    &quot; with modern developments.&quot;Control of  Units allotted to the Navy.(a.) When on Shore.    21. The Air Force maintains for the exclusive administration of those air unitsallocated for naval requirements, the &quot; Coastal Area,&quot; under an Air Vice-Marshal, withheadquarters in London.  There  are under  him two Group Captains, with headquarters at Leuchars and Lee-on-Solent, who are in direct  touch with the Naval authorities.The Air Officer Commanding, Coastal Area, is himself the adviser  to the Admiralty on air matters other than policy, and is also responsible direct to the Commander-in-Chief,Atlantic  Fleet, that  the  latter&apos;s air  requirements  are  met.   At  Malta  a   similarheadquarters  under  a Group  Captain is maintained.  The latter  is in  direct touchwith the Commander in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet.
    22. The Air Officer Commanding the Coastal Area is responsible for the trainis of these units when on shore and for the maintenance of these units at full strength \\ Ipersonnel and materiel,  both when ashore and afloat.                               I    23. To quote the evidence  of Air-Marshal Vyvyan,. the Air Officer CommandingCoastal Area (paragraph 14, 4th  Meeting) :-         &quot;As Air Officer Commanding, I am adviser, in the first instance, to the    &quot; Admiralty  on all Naval air  questions.    For this  purpose I. deal direct with.    &quot; the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff,  who has  under him two Naval Officers    &quot; for Naval  Air  duties.  L  also act as adviser on operational. questions to the    &quot; Naval Commanders-in-Chief  of the various home stations. .. For the training,    &quot; maintenance and supply of units in my Command I am responsible to the Ait    &quot; Ministry.         &quot; The  Coastal Area is divided into two groups,  one at Lee-on-Solent, which is    &quot; by Portsmouth, and.the.other  at Leuchars, which is near Rosyth.   The officers    &quot; commanding these groups also keep in direct touch with the Naval Commanders-    &quot; in-Chief  on matters within their immediate responsibility.         &quot; I ought perhaps to add that I am only concerned writh /units based on home    &quot; stations.   At Malta, which is  the only overseas Naval base where aircraft are    &quot; maintained, the Senior Royal  Air Force Officer is  directly under the orders ol    &quot; the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean.         &quot;The Coastal Area  is responsible,  firstly,  for  keeping those units up to    &quot;strength  and embarking them on carriers at any time  when required by the:    &quot; Naval Commanders-in-Chief;  secondly, for administering the training units and    .&quot; for exercising and training carrier-borne and other units when operating from   &quot; shore bases.   .      &quot;I want to-make it clear to the Committee that the units which are controlled   : &quot; by the Coastal Area are dependent  for  their  maintenance  both in men and :   &quot; material upon, other establishments of the  Royal Air Force which are outside my    &quot;command and which serve the Air Force as a whole. &apos;        &quot;It may be  of  interest  to the  Committee  if  I  say something  about the    &quot; relationship  between the  Coastal Area and the Naval Commander-in-Chief on    &quot;questions  of operations  and of  embarking and disembarking personnel and    &quot; machines.  My business, as I have said, is to keep units up to strength ready for    &quot; embarkation whenever required.  For larger operations the Naval Commander-    &quot; in-Chief notifies me his requirements  as regards the embarking of aircraft or the    &quot;carrying out of operations from shore bases.   For minor operations he would    &apos;&quot;  deal direct with the Commanding Officers of one or other of the two groups.                          4i*             *j              *!              ^t&quot;  &quot;,      &quot;I am  on exactly the  same footing as  the Admiral  of Submarines in so far    &quot;  as the Commander-in-Chief is concerned.&quot;    24.  From the above paragraph it is clear that the Naval  Commander-in-Chief hascontrol over those Air units which are allotted to him, even when on shore, and can atany time order the machines which he may require to  be embarked on the carriers.    The Units are always at the immediate  call of the Admiralty and cannot be taken away by the Air  Ministry for any other purpose.    The machines are not kept permanently embarked on the  carriers, as it is necessaryto carry  out training  on shore to supplement that done when on  the carrier, and thecarrier cannot always be kept &quot; steaming.&quot;(b.)  When embarked with the Fleet.     25.  As soon as the Aircraft are on the carriers they are under the orders of theCommander-in-Chief  and altogether outside the control of the Coastal Area, who areonly responsible for replacing sick personnel or  unserviceable machines.  The ordersfor flying are given by the Commander-in-Chief to the Captain of the Aircraft Carrierwho is, of course, a Naval, officer, and he  gives his orders to the senior Air ForceOfficer on board.  &apos; There are no direct communications between the Coastal Area orthe Group and this officer even on technical-matters ; in all cases they must go throughthe Captain of  the ship.     26.  In every case,  and under all conditions, the  senior Air  Force Officer  on acarrier is  bound  to  carry out the  orders given to him by the Captain of the  ship.
 Should he consider that the orders given are impracticable he can represent his views to the Captain; but if the latter, in spite of such representation, persists in the carrying out of the order, the senior Air Force Officer is bound to do so. Relations and Co-operation between the Services on Board a Carrier.     27. The Royal Air Force personnel, when embarked on a carrier, are under the Naval Discipline Act, and are under the supreme&apos;command of the  Captain  of the. ship.  Punishment for offences is, therefore,  awarded by the  Captain of  the ship, but he may delegate some  of his powers  of  punishment  to the senior Royal Air Force Officer, although he is not bound to do so.     28. On shore the Royal Air Force personnel serve under  the Air  Force Act, and the  scales of  punishment under  this Act  are different to  those  under  the  Naval Discipline Act.     29. The Captain of  the  ship, although   e can award punishment, cannot officially commend an officer or airman for good work, and. he  renders no confidential reports on Royal Air  Force , Officers  serving under him.   These reports are rendered  by the senior Royal Air Force Officer through Royal Air Force channels to  the Air Ministry, and do not pass through the Naval Commander-in-Chief.     30. Operational orders are issued by the Captain  of the  ship, but since he may. not have experience of air matters he is bound to rely on the advice  of the Senior Air Force officer.  The Captain  can,  however, overrule any suggestions put forward by the senior Air Force officer should he consider it expedient to do so,    31. The Captain of the Ship can issue any orders he may wish  to the Royal Air Force personnel with regard to the general handling and working of the ship. .    The senior Air Force officer can represent that his men. are otherwise  employed, but should the  Captain decide against him, such orders must invariably be carried out.    32. The Royal Air Force personnel are responsible for the cleanliness and general maintenance of their own quarters and other portions of the ship such as the aeroplane deck.   They can be employed, as far as  their training permits, on  the general  duties of the ship,  but of course cannot be utilised to perform any function  where  naval knowledge is essential.    Thus the Royal  Air Force Officers do not act as watch-keeping officers, and arenot required to perform navigational or any similar duties which are purely Naval.    33. A certain amount of co-operation is practised between the skilled mechanicsof both services.  The   Royal  Air Force  may utilise  the  service  of  the  ship&apos;sblacksmith  for certain repairs to aeroplane engines, and  the Royal Air Force mayundertake repairs  to  motor-boat engines.   Such, co-operation  is naturally limited byhighly technical training which is inherent in each service.(B.)-THE. NAVAL  OBJECTIONS  TO THE  PRESENT  SYSTEM  AND THE          AIR, MINISTRY^ COMMENTS  ON THOSE OBJECTIONS.    34.  The main Naval objection to the present system is a question of principle.    The Admiralty maintain that they should  be solely responsible for  the efficiency ofthe Fleet, and  that under the present system a dual responsibility exists between  theAdmiralty and Air Ministry in as far as the  Air units working with the Fleet  areconcerned.  The following  quotation from Part I of  the Summary of  the AdmiraltyCase (N.D. (R) 17) exemplifies in  more  detail the foundations of the principle :          &quot; In  the problem of Imperial  Defence  the Admiralty are responsible for  the    &quot; security of  the  sea communications, and this security is achieved  by means of    &quot; the Fleet, which consists of units working on the surface, above  the surface and    &quot; below the surface.  The responsibility for  all  such units must rest with  the    &quot; Admiralty.        &quot; At the present time the Admiralty  have not full control of the unit for duty    &quot; above the sea, namely, the Fleet Air Arm, with the result that  the Admiralty    &quot; cannot be held responsible for its efficiency, thereby destroying this fundamental    &quot; principle.&quot;
The main objections were brought out fully in the evidence given by Admiral Sir John&apos;de  Robeok, Commander-in-Chief  Atlantic&quot; Fleet, and  a summary of those objections^is as follows :     35.   &quot;(1-) I have had carriers under my command  since 1919, and  have never                   &quot; been satisfied with the present system.          &quot; (2.) The  Captain of a carrier should, if he is to enjoy the full confidence                   &quot; and respect  of  his  subordinates, have Air  knowledge, and this                   &quot; will be possible in the future  if the Navy  possesses  its own                   &quot; Air Arm.          &quot; (3.) At present the Senior Air Officer embarked has two masters.  Though                   &quot; such an arrangement maybe permissible in civil life, it is fraught                     with danger  in a fighting service.          &quot; (4.) When we have  several carriers with  the Fleet  there  should be that                   &apos;&apos; same desire  to  excel  amongst  themselves  as there is  in eacl                   &quot; battleship and cruiser to-day. This is traditional in our Service,                   &quot; and R.A.F. personnel embarked cannot be expected  to share in                   &quot; it to the same degree as would, for instance, a west-country crew                   &quot; with west-country flying men against men of their own clotih                   &quot; drawn, let us say, from  Portsmouth or Chatham.          &quot;(5.) Aircraft are the eyes  of the Commander-in-Chief, and he  has a right                   &quot; to expect that the Fleet  airmen who do him this important service                   &quot; should be under his complete control.          &quot; (6.) It is for the Navy to state the requirements, and this has been done bj                   &quot; the  principal officers of  the Fleet with  remarkable unanimity.          &quot; (7.) Our  future airmen must belong  to the Navy, drawn from the same                   &quot; source, brought  up from the start in  our service, having the same                   &quot; thoughts, same methods, same discipline, same uniform.          &quot; (8.) I cannot for  a moment  accept  the  view  that for a.  purely  Naval                   &quot; service under my orders the Air Ministry or any other body                   &quot; outside  the Admiralty  should have any  voice  in,  much less                   &quot; dictate as to the source  from which the requisite personnel should                   &quot; be drawn, or the manner in which they should  be. trained or the                   &quot; tt-rm that they should serve.           (9.) The Fleet airmen  will have duties as highly technical as the gunnerj                   &quot;or torpedo specialists  of the Fleet;  he will not be  properly                   &quot; efficient, unless, like them, he has been trained as a Naval officer.         &quot; (10.) Unless the Admiralty are the sole and  absolute possessors of their own                   &quot; machines and the men who man them,  it is  not improbable that                   &quot; to meet some call considered more pressing the Fleet may find                   &quot; itself deprived of a portion of this invaluable arm.         &quot; (11,) The part played by  Naval aircraft will  be an ever-increasing one.                   &quot; This new  weapon and arm  of the Fleet has  a bearing on the                   &quot; strategical and tactical problems which make it imperative that,                   &quot; at least, a proportion of  the  principal officers  of His Majesty&apos;s                   &quot; Navy should have practical knowledge and a clear conception of                   &quot; the  use of this arm which they can bring to bear in future Naval                   &quot; problems.   This can only  be effected by the formation of a Naval                   &quot; Air Arm, which  will permit of officers starting their flying career                   &quot;&apos;with an amount  of solid Naval knowledge  and, when ceasing to                   &quot; be of a suitable flying age, of  reverting to the general service                   &quot; with the additional experience of the  air behind them.         &quot;(12.) The  present R.A.F.   personnel  embarked  are  short service; they                   &quot; are  required  to  learn Navy, Army and Air Force  procedure in                   &quot; the  important matter of wireless  communication as  well  as in                   &quot; other directions ; they are naturally  susceptible to sea-sickness;                   &quot; to them, service at sea, with  its attendant discomforts, is  not so                   &quot; popular as service ashore,  with  the amenities of  barrack life,                   &quot; and when at sea they feel disowned by their own Service and yet                   &quot; not  adopted by  ours. This  unhappy state  of  affairs  should be                   &quot; ended, and 1 prophesy that, when it is, the interest of the whole                   &quot; Navy in its new branch will be  stimulated, and it will  receive                   &quot; the drive of a service that knows what it wants and  will see that                   &quot; it gets it.
         &quot; (13.) The Admiralty is responsible for the retention of the command of the                   &quot; sea, and  not the Air Ministry.  Who will  absolve&apos; the Admiralty                   &quot; from blame if for  any reason the Fleet enters  the war handi-                   &quot; capped as it would be under existing conditions ?         &quot; The country would  have  a right to ask why so important an adjunct of the     &quot; Fleet was allowed to be  in any way under the control of a body of  men who are     &quot; not called upon to have any sea knowledge or any experience of sea matters.         &quot; It is no good mincing matters, and I am convinced that there cannot, under     &quot; the existing arrangement, be  that perfect understanding which is  so necessary     &quot; between the Air Arm of  the Fleet and the remainder of the Fleet.         &quot; The confidence and  sympathy which  exists between the various branches of     &quot; the Service,  as, for instance, between officers  in battleships  and  submarines,     &quot;exists  because each understands the other; they were  midshipmen together,     &quot; watch-keepers together,  in such-and-such a  ship together.  They  both  look to     &quot; the same authority  for orders, they  struggle in the same lists for promotion, and     &quot; they share similar grievances.         &quot; As the oldest sea officer afloat,  I tell you that, if you deny  the Fleet its  own     &quot; Air Arm, you  deprive it  of the power  to  exert its maximum force when called     &quot; upon.&quot;     36. The Admiralty also point out that Air Ministry Estimates, and  not AdmiraltyEstimates, determine policy and development of the Fleet Air Arm.   In consequence,it  is urged that the Navy are never certain of having  its requirements realised, as it depends  on whether the  Air  Ministry Estimates  are  sufficient to meet them.   TheAdmiralty maintain that whilst  this uncertainty exists, it is impossible  to make out with confidence either the strategical dispositions of the Fleet or to place full reliance on theFleet Air Arm tactically (N.D. (R) 17. Part II, paragraph 2).    37. The  Air Staff, on the  other  hand, maintain that  the present system is satisfactory as far as it goes.   The  following extracts  from  the Summary of the AirMinistry case will illustrate their views with regard  to the main principles involved inthe question:          &quot; The Air Staff cannot find  in any part of the First Sea Lord&apos;s  evidence or in    &quot; that  of  the other  Admiralty  witnesses any  recognition  of the  fact that  the    &quot; efficiency of the  Fleet  cannot be properly regarded as an end itself, or that it    &quot; should be considered in relation to the greater principle of the country s defence    &quot; interest &quot;as a whole.   If it can  be shown as the Air Staff contend has been done,    &quot; that to redivide the Air Service would be prejudicial to  a final  defence interest,    &quot; namely, that of safety in the air, and if it is also the  case that the  efficiency of    &quot; the Fleet in  no way suffers and is  indeed promoted  by the present method of    &quot; providing Naval  Air units, then there is  no  reason for going back upon  the    &quot; present  system in  order  to satisfy  a  demand based on an arbitrary principle    &quot; which has  no  bearing upon the real  issues involved in this controversy.           *****        &quot; The  Air  Staff  feel that  any  concession  to the  Admiralty of  &apos; sole    &quot; &apos; responsibility&apos; as  regards air  units working with the  Fleet should equally    &quot; be applied to the War Office  as regards the organisation  of  air units for  the    &quot; army.   In view of  the recent decision as to provision of these latter units they    &quot; urge that it would be anomalous that a decision in the opposite  sense should be    &quot; given, in the matter  of air units working with the Navy.        &quot; As  a  corollary  to their  main  contention,   the Air  Staff are absolutely    &quot; convinced  (1)  that if the principle of a separate  Naval  air service is admitted,    &quot; no partial severance is practicable, and the Naval air service must be completely    &quot; independent in all respects.  (2) That whatever hopes in organisation may now    &quot; be held out by the Admiralty the  final  and near  result of setting up a second    &quot; air service will be  largely increased expenditure  in proportion to  the return    &quot; obtained from it.          *              *             *             *             *        &quot; The objections to the re-establishment of  a separate naval air service, or as    &quot; the Admiralty prefer to call it,  a  naval  air  arm, were in point of  fact fully  set    &quot; out less than a year ago.   It may be convenient briefly here to restate them :         &quot; la.)  The work of naval air units (whether provided by the Admiralty or the    &quot;. Air Ministry) is inherently different in nature from that of  Naval units properly      [10330]                                                            c
     &quot; so called.   Surface or submarine craft  operate in a two-dimensional element&apos;     &quot; aircraft operate in another element, which is one  of three dimensions.   More-     &quot; over, if the actual duties carried  out  by the Air  units co-operating with the     &quot; Navy are  examined in  detail from  their various aspects, it is  clear that air     &quot; experience and  training  are  prior  in importance to naval qualifications.   In     &quot; short,  Naval air units are primarily air units,  and  not sea units, whether     &quot; regarded from the point  of view of operations or equipment.          &quot; The Naval Staff seek to establish their claim to a separate and independent     &quot;air service manned, equipped,  controlled and administered  by the Admiralty,   .  &quot; partly by  alleging administrative defects and failures of the present system,     &quot; and partly by urging that, apart from such defects, a separate Naval air service     &quot; is a necessary and inseparable element  in the naval organisation required for     &quot; guaranteeing the security of our sea communications.          &apos;&apos;  (b.) The Chief of the Air Staff in  his evidence argued that one reason for     &quot; the maintenance of a  unified air service was that to set up a subsidiary naval     &quot; air service would militate against the effective organisation of  our air power as     &quot; a whole.   The Naval  Staff fastened upon  this as  disclosing an intention to     &quot; develop the Fleet air arm with a view to the air defence of the British Islands     &quot;instead  of for duty with the  Fleet, and  claim it as demonstrating  the,&apos;vital     &quot; &apos; necessity of removing from  the Air Ministry every vestige  of control of the     &quot; &apos; fleet air arm.&apos;         &quot; (c.) The attitude of the Naval Staff  on this point indicates  clearly what  can     &quot; only  be described as a  fundamental lack of understanding  of the  real issues in     &quot; this controversy.   The Naval Staff refuse to recognise that  the extension of war-     &quot; fare to the air has introduced a new and permanent complication in the problem     &quot; of national defence, or  to realise that, as the  air overlies both  sea and land, so     &quot; the need for aerial supremacy will be as vital to the  security of this country as     &quot; sea supremacy has been in the past.         &quot; If at some future date the British Empire is compelled  to fight in the air for     &quot; its existence as in the past it has been compelled to fight on land  and sea, it is     &quot; vital  that  our Air forces  should  be reared  on a single policy and trained on     &quot; a single system, imbued with a single doctrine not only at home, but throughout     &quot; the dominions.         &quot; The air can  be approached from one  angle only; any  attempt to utilise it     &quot; from  two  totally different angles will handicap its employment to a  disastrous     &quot; extent.  Moreover, it is impossible to define the dividing line  between the air     &quot; with  the Fleet and the  remainder of  the Air Arm.   Between the air on the  one     &quot; hand and land and sea on the other,  there is no high-water mark.   Definition of     &quot; the dividing line will always defy the attempts of either the  Naval or Air Staffs&quot;     38.  The  Air Staff  consider,&apos; however, the liaison  between the Admiralty, asrepresented by the  D.C.N.S., and the Air Ministry, as represented  by  the D.C.A.S.,could be improved.  They attribute any lack of co-operation in this respect to the factthat the Admiralty do not make full use of the  existing machinery, and consider that ifthis  were done there would be an increase in efficiencj7.     39.  The more detailed objections, together with the comments by the Air Ministry,have been enumerated in the succeeding paragraphs, and have, as  far as possible, beengrouped under the same sub-headings as were utilised in (A).Design,  Research Work and Supply  of Materiel.     40.  The Admiralty maintain that they have no  control over the design of  aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm, and that they are not at present  represented  in the  Design orResearch Departments  at the Air Ministry.  They  feel  therefore that Naval require-ments may not receive due consideration, and that perhaps greater effort is expendedon catering  for the needs of  the Air Force itself.   They complain  that at  present it takes  two  years to produce  a  new  type of  machine,  and consider that, Navalrepresentation in these Departments would tend to shorten that period.     It was also stated  that obsolete instruments, such as  compasses, were fitted to theNaval machines, and it was claimed that more modern types were  in existence.     With these exceptions, the Admiralty expressed themselves as satisfied  generally with the quality of the materiel  and the existing methods of supply.     41.  The Air  Ministry consider that the Admiralty&apos;s  statement that &quot; they have no&quot; control over the design of aircraft for  the  Fleet Air Arm&quot; is a half-truth which again
 illustrates their inability  to  overcome a purely departmental  outlook.  Attention is called to the fact that the Admiralty are kept fully in touch with the progress of design and  its bearing upon their requirements in terms of performance, &amp;c, as formulated by the Naval Staff.     42. With regard to the complaint that it now takes two years to produce a new type of  machine for the Navy, the Air Staff  pointed out that, in view of the  present economic conditions and the vital necessity for economy, a period of two years could not be considered unduly lengthy.  Such a  period, might  be reduced if  overtime could be worked and costs were of no consideration, but attention was called  to the fact that the average time now taken from the inception of a new type to  its ultimate delivery was far shorter than had been  the case during the  war  when  money  was  no object. Most of the types designed during  the war had  taken over three years to complete. The time was mostly taken up  in the design and  experimental stages, and once the type was finally approved production followed quickly.    It was explained that several new types were  due for delivery at the end of the present  year.    The Air  Staff pointed  out  that  no   complaints  had been  received at the Air Ministry with regard to the equipment which had been provided for Naval Air  units. Supply  of Personnel.    43. The Navy have no complaints with regard  to the  quality of the personnel, both officers and other ranks, who are posted for  duty with the Naval Air units ;  neither do they complain that the general flying work is inefficiently  performed.  It is considered, however, that, owing to  their  initial training not having been  with the  Navy, the officers are lacking in &quot; sea sense,&quot; and that they do not possess sufficient &quot;navigational&quot; knowledge for flying at sea.    Great stress was laid  on the  fact that  the observers for reconnaissance machines were drawn from the Royal Air Force and were not Naval officers.    44. In this connection the following extract from  the evidence of  Lord Beatty is given (paragraphs 143 and 148 to  151, 2nd Meeting):          &quot;We consider it is  a matter of great importance to the  work of a Fleet that    &quot; the reconnaissance  officer  should be a naval officer, an officer  who has  been    &quot; brought up as such and has war sea instinct: who  knows exactly what he sees    &quot; and can report correctly.  It may be  on that very report that the success of the    &quot; Commander-in-Chief in bringing the enemy  to action  will depend, and we    &quot; contend that this is a question of paramount importance ;  that it takes  a great    &quot; many years to train  efficient Captains of light cruisers to make reports on which    &quot; the Commander-in-Chief  can dispose  his Fleet, steam the right course, put them    &quot; in the right formation and be in a position tactically superior to the enemy,  and    &quot; from our experience in the Navy even Post  Captains who have had many years    &quot; at sea  have  failed to give  on a  big  platform, with not a great dual to interfere    &quot; with them, proper  and adequate reports.  Therefore we consider that the very    &quot; best should be utilised for the purposes of observation and reconnaissance work.         *            *           *                      *        &quot; Lord Weir: What length  of Naval  training would give  the qualifications,    &quot; the naval feeling and spirit; what length of Naval training  as a minimum ?        &quot; Lord Beatty : I should say a  Lieutenant  or a man  who has been at sea for    &quot; ten years or  so should be  able  accurately to diagnose the situation and make    &quot; reports.        &quot;Lord Weir:  Is  that  ten years after he  has left Dartmouth, or  including    &quot; Dartmouth ?        &quot; Lord Beatty: No ;  after he has left Dartmouth.   In time he acquires the    &quot; sea sense ; it is not a thing he  can acquire in a short time.&quot;    45.  Admiral Sir John de Robeck, Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic  Fleet, also laidgreat emphasis on the importance  of the reconnaissance  officer being a Naval officer.The following extracts from his  evidence bear on this point:         &quot; I held  the view then and  it will  never change that all aircraft which    &quot; accompany the Fleet, whether they be in carriers or act independently, as would    &quot; large flying boats, or airships,  must be  manned by Naval personnel under  the    &quot; absolute control of the Admiralty, who will delegate authority to  the  command    &quot; at sea.[10330]
         &quot; I cannot imagine any Naval commander-in-Chief, present or future, having     &quot; any  other view, nor,  indeed, any body  of reasonable men who  regard the     &quot; essential principle and not the petty difficulties and details attendant on any     &quot; change.   For what are aircraft at sea to-day ?   They should be  the  eyes of the     &quot; Commander-in-Chief.   They should  be my eyes  to-day just as  much  as  were     &quot; light cruisers to the  Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet,  and  the twenty-     &quot; eight-gun frigates to Nelson.         &quot; The airman will require to recognise the various types of enemy vessels  he     &quot; sees, to judge  what their occupation is, whether  reconnaissance, minelaying,     &quot; minesweeping, submarine hunting, &amp;c, to note positions of buoys, light vessels     &quot; or other navigational marks, alterations in the characteristics of lighthouses, and     &quot; from these deduce, with  his previous Naval training and  knowledge  of sea     &quot; warfare, the possible intentions of the enemy.   By  a Naval officer much can be     &quot; conjectured  from  an  enemy&apos;s cruising or approach  formation  : Has he all his     &quot; destroyer forces on  one  flank  or are they  divided ?   Where  are his  fleet     &quot; submarines stationed ?  Has he minelayers with him ?  Do his fighting ships     &quot; carry aircraft ?  Where are his carriers stationed ?  The trained  Naval observer     &quot; will know what is important to  look for and  to report;  he has learned  from     &quot; experience of the &apos; other end,&apos; ie., the bridge of a man-of-war, what is vital and     &quot; what is  not,  and  in receiving  his instructions and  in making  his report  a     &quot; familiar  language will be used.&quot;   (Paragraph 7, Sth Meeting.)     46. The following statement, which bears on the question generally, was also  readby  Lord  Beatty, and  may be inserted appropriately at  this point (paragraph  260,2nd Meeting):          &quot; While the social and personal relations  between the Naval officers and the     &quot; Air Force officers are very good, their official relations leave much to  be desired.     &quot; There is a spirit of  opposition on the part of the Air Force officers, who, when     &quot;they  go  afloat,  appear  to  be  given to understand  that  unless they  &apos;fight&apos;     &quot; (officially) the Naval  officers they will be considered  as letting  the Air Force     &quot; down.  There is little  spirit of co-operation ; the  Air  Force officer is usually on     11 the defensive.  While he bows to the inevitable and recognises the authority of     &quot; the  Captain, he cannot or  will  not appreciate the  status of   the Executive     &quot; officer, especially if, as  in the case of  &apos; Argus,&apos;  a  senior Air  Force officer  is in     &quot; rank senior to the Executive officer of a ship.         &quot; The  difficulties with  regard  to  the  Air Force personnel serving  in  the     &quot; Fleet appear to fall under two heads :          &quot; (a.)  Those which are inherent in. the position.         &quot; (6.)  Details  relating to discipline which have arisen owing  to the attempts                 &quot; of the Air  Ministry  to  retain the last  word on all disciplinary                 &quot; matters relating to Air  Force officers and men.         &quot; The position is that the  personnel serving in the Fleet (or at all events the     &quot; officers) are  serving or  attempting to serve &quot;two masters.  Some of the effects of     &quot; this have been remarked on above.         &quot; As regards drafting, tlw Air Ministry claim the  right to send any officer to     &quot; serve in the Fleet regardless of his fitness for  sea work.  The result is  that in     &quot; some cases pilots are  sent to the  Fleet who have no  &apos; sea sense&apos; whatever, to     &quot; whom deck landings  are  a thing of horror, who are unable to find their  way     &quot; about over the trackless ocean, and to whom  the various objects  they may sight     &quot; convey little or nothing,  I have been informed that,  at a War  Game recently     &quot; played at the Royal Naval  Staff College between officers  of that College  and     11 officers of the Royal Air Force Staff  College, the  Royal Air Force officers,  who     &quot; had had no sea training, were quite &apos; at sea,&apos; and, though first-rate  men at  &apos;shore-     &quot; going&apos; flying, were unable to locate themselves on charts or even to read charts     &quot; as they could read maps, and yet, at any time these officers might  have been  sent     &quot; to serve in the Fleet.   This does not, of course, imply any disparagement to the     &quot; officers  in question, but, it emphasises the point that Fleet flying  and shore     &quot; flying are in many respects essentially different.         &quot; In such a community as the  personnel of a ship it  is essential for good     &quot; discipline and the clue performance of difficult duties that the whole  should be     &quot; under one command,   that there  should  be no  divided  allegiance, and  that    &quot;  everyone-especially  the  officers should  look  to one   authority  alone, for    &quot; advancement in his profession.
I                                       13I         &quot; There is, I understand, among members of  the Air Force a feeling that theI     &quot; recommendations and commendation of Naval officers  do not receive their dueI     &quot; weight at the Air  Ministry because they come  from  the Navy.   The idea is,I     &quot; perhaps, exaggerated, but it exists, and it is bad for discipline and efficiency.I         &quot; It would  be fatal to  effective service if, in view of the known difficulties[     &quot; between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, an idea got abroad that the way to      &quot; get  on in the Air Force is to be obstructive  and unpleasant  to  the  NavalI      &quot; authorities when serving in the Fleet and to avoid such service if possible.   The      &quot; result would be that the best men in the Air Force would not serve afloat if they      &quot; could possibly help it.          &quot;The system of  seconding  Naval officers for service with the Air Force, as      &quot; advocated by the Air Ministry, has up to the present- been unsuccessful  owing to      &quot; the fact that Naval  officers are averse to serving &apos; two masters.&apos;          &quot; The competition for promotion in the Navy is so keen that any period spent      &quot; with another Service, and  not under the immediate supervision of their Naval      &quot; superiors,  is  considered  by  Naval  officers to  be prejudicial  to  their  own      &quot; interests.&quot;      17. The Admiralty further complain that officers are posted away from the Naval  units before they have completed  their normal tour of  duty  and may be replaced  by  officers who have little  experience of Naval  matters.   The specific case of a senior  officer, who  had no Naval experience whatsoever, being posted to command the Naval  group at  Leuchars,  was  referred to by Admiral  Fuller (paragraphs  335 and  337,  4th Meeting).      48. The Air Staff are  unable to agree that it is more important for officers serving  with Naval Air units to  possess first &quot; sea sense,&quot;  on which can be superimposed air  training and &quot; air sense.&quot;   They argue that  the  reverse is the case, and  maintain that  it  is  comparatively easy to impose sufficient  naval knowledge and  sea sense on  an  officer who  already  possesses a thorough  groundwork of  air training.  It is  not  considered that the Naval  Air  Service is comparable to the  Submarine  Service, since  the former possesses  its own air strategy and air tactics.     49. With regard to the provision of  Naval officers as observers in reconnaissance  machines.  Here, again, the Air  Ministry consider that air knowledge is  of  primary importance, and that naval knowledge is a secondary consideration.     They maintain that it is far easier to train an  officer  to  observe over the sea than over land, and that their officers are trained to report exactly what is seen, and are not permitted to make  deductions from their observations, the  latter  function being the duty of the Naval officer to whom the reports are rendered.     50. With regard to the removal  of officers  from  duty with Naval  units, the Air Staff point out that such a practice is rare, and only carried out when the interests of the Service demand that such  a course should be taken.   With regard to the specific case at Leuchars mentioned, by Admiral Fuller, it was explained that the  officer posted was a particularly capable  officer  with  great experience of air work, and  was specially selected with a view to effecting an improvement at Leuchars. Seconding of Officers.     5.1. The question of  the  seconding  of Naval officers to  the  Royal Air Force, primarily for  duty  with  the  Fleet  Air arm, has been dealt with fully  by both Departments in N.D.  (R) 17 and N.D. (R) IS respectively.     The Air Staff would welcome Naval officers being seconded for service with the Air Force.    They complain  that their  original scheme in this  respect, although accepted  by the Admiralty, received  little support or commendation,  and that the Admiralty have taken no  steps  to  encourage Naval officers to  volunteer for service with the Air units, and  in support of these  statements; call  attention to the  various Fleet Orders calling for volunteers which  have been published  (N.D. (li) 18, Part II). The Admiralty, on the other hand, claim that it is not customary in the Navy  to offer inducements to  Naval officers to specialise in any particular branch of Naval service, and state that the Fleet Orders calling for volunteers for secondment to the  Royal  Air Force was couched in the same terms as used when calling for  officers  to  specialise in gunnery, submarines or torpedo work.
    52. The following  is  an extract from  the  summary  of the  Admiralty Case(N.D. (R) 17), in which their views on this question are expressed : -    &quot; Reasons showing why Seconding is unsound in Principle and  Application.         &quot; During the  proceedings  of the Sub-Committee  &apos; seconding&apos;  in  various    &quot; degrees has frequently been referred to  as a possible  means of producing a    &quot; satisfactory  scheme.    In  reviewing  any   seconding  scheme   the  primary    &quot; consideration is. will  it remove  the  main reason for the failure  of the present    &quot; system, viz., &apos; divided control&apos; ?  The Admiralty contend that &apos;  seconding,&apos; even    &quot; when carried tothe extent of officering the  Fleet Air Arm entirely by seconded    &quot; Naval Officers,  cannot do this.         &quot;The evidence given by Admiralty witnesses is strongly to the effect that    &quot; seconding would  not  meet the case, and  the evidence of one  of  the principal    &quot; witnesses of the Air Ministry is also largely  against it.         &quot; Why Seconding is not a Solution of the Difficulty.  It  would not  do away    &quot; with divided control because-         &quot; (i.) Naval Air Policy would  still be dependent on Air Ministry estimates.        &quot; (ii.) Specialised Naval training and daily training practices, other than those                &quot; carried out from  Carriers, would  still  remain in  hands  of Air                &quot; Ministry        &quot; (iii.) Appointment of Officers and drafting of airmen would  still remain with                &quot; Air Ministry, even  though they are Naval  Officers  appointed  for                &quot; ships of  the Royal Navy.        &quot; (iv.) Admiralty would  still have  no control  over the flying careers  of  the                &quot; Officers of  the Fleet Air Arm.         &quot; (v.) Admiralty would still have no control over development  and maintenance                &quot; of material for Naval Air purposes.        &quot; (vi.) Admiralty would  still have  no control over reserves  of personnel  or                &quot; machines.         &quot; Why Seconding is Unsound in Application.         &quot; (a.) Seconding was tried  in 1D20 at a favourable  time, as  the Lieutenants                &quot; list was crowded and  reductions were inevitable, but  there was no                &quot; response.         &quot; (6.) If volunteers should not come forward, compulsion would be out of  the                &quot; question.         &quot; (c.) A  seconded  Officer  has  a  feeling of insecurity,  as his  immediate                &quot; superiors belong to another Service who are not responsible  for                &quot; his future.                                                     *         &quot; (d.) In the Navy, where promotion is competitive throughout the Service,                &quot; seconding  to another Force  can never  be  popular, and  the  best                &quot; Officers will  not  volunteer, with the  result that  Officers  in  the                &quot; higher ranks of the Navy with Air experience will  not be  of  the                &quot; highest quality.                     &quot; Secondment  of the type suggested is entirely different  to  the                &quot; secondment which  obtains in  the Army from one regiment  to                &quot; another,  and where promotion is by seniority in the regiment from                &quot; which the  Officer is seconded.         &quot; (e.) There will be  a  considerable  increase in the Lieutenants list, which                &quot; will mean  blocking promotion in the  Navy unless a proportionate                &quot; increase  in the number of  Officers in the senior ranks of the Navy                &quot; is also allowed.         &quot; (/.) The Commander-in-Chief will have no practical means of judging the                 &quot; flying efficiency  of a seconded Naval  Officer  until  he arrives on                 &quot; board the  Carrier, and his first flight may be on active service.         &quot; Apart from all the  above reasons is it not incongruous to second an Officer     &quot; to another Service, when during the  greater part of his time when seconded he     &quot; is to  be employed in men-of-war and serve in his Own Service?         &quot; The seconded Naval Officer,  though camouflaged in R.A.F. uniform, will     &quot; still be a Naval Officer  at heart,  but he  will  have to camouflage this fact  also, if     &quot; he is to appear on the surface as successfully serving two masters.         &quot; This can only lead to inefficiency and lack of progress.&quot;
    53. The  Air  Ministry, in the Summary of their Case  (N.D. (R)  18), make thefollowing reply to the remarks of the Admiralty quoted in the preceding paragraph :         &quot; The Admiralty&apos;s objections to  the  proposals for  the secondment  of naval    &quot; officers for air duties are in fact that they do not  amount to the, same thing as    &quot; setting up a separate naval air service,   ft was, of course, not intended that they    &quot; should, but the Admiralty evade the point that a large element of secondment as    &quot; proposed by the  Air Ministry, while avoiding the disadvantages of setting up    &quot; two separate air services, would meet all the objections which the  Admiralty    &quot; have brought against  the efficiency of the present system  except the actual    &quot; question of Admiralty responsibility.        &quot; All the objections raised  in  their  paper are  based on this  question of    &quot; responsibility, which  is  given  a formidable appearance by  division  into six    &quot; sub-headings.  It  is really  a  question  merely   of responsibility  and not of    &quot; efficiency.        &quot; It has not been contended  by the Admiralty  in any of the evidence placed    &quot; before  the  Committee  that, if the  system of seconding were put into force, it    &quot; would not ensure the production of  a body of Naval officers with air experience    &quot; and competent to judge the true value which should be attached to the Air Arm    &quot;of the Fleet.   ;        &quot; A  separate  Naval  air service, on the other hand, has already  by practical    &quot; experience been proved to create antagonism and rivalry in aerial organisation.    &quot; Secondment would, moreover, preserve the principle that the conditions of service    &quot; in connection with flying  should be the same for all officers and airmen, whereas    &quot; dual organisation would  inevitably  create anomalies between the conditions of    &quot; employment, which would be a  further source of much friction.        &quot; As regards  appointment of seconded officers to  carriers, the Air Ministry    &quot; would have no objection to Admiralty concurrence in  such appointments being    &quot; obtained  or to consulting the  Admiralty on all  questions touching  the flying    &quot; career of those officers.        &quot; The Admiralty&apos;s criticism of the present system includes a reference to the    &quot; certainty of its  &apos; failure  in  war.&apos;   The  answer  to this  is that the  system of    &quot; provision of air units for  the  Navy by the R.A F. successfully stood the test of    &quot; war for 8  months in 1918, and   that  the  then First  Sea Lord, writing in    &quot; January 1919 (G.T. 6613) at a time  when the lessons of war were fresher in the    &quot; minds  of the Naval Staff, fully accepted  the present system as providing a    &quot; higher standard of airmanship than a purely naval air  service could attain.        &quot; The  Admiralty  adduce  seven  reasons  why &apos; seconding  is  unsound in    &quot; application.&apos;  These may be  considered in their order :          &quot; (a.) The Air Ministry emphatically do  not accept the statement that any    &quot; serious attempt has been  made to carry out the principle of secondment.  It was    &quot; first specifically  suggested by the Admiralty itself in   1919, but  by July 1920,    &quot; when  the Fleet Order inviting applications was issued, it was common knowledge    &quot; that the Admiralty were  pressing to regain a separate naval air service.   All    &quot; officers feared that it would be a  case of &apos; out of sight, out of mind&apos; if they    &quot; left the main line of naval service where there would  be no senior naval officers    &quot; to support their retention.        &quot;The  Admiralty  claim that the two Fleet Orders,  one  for officers to be    &quot; seconded  to the Royal  Air Force and the other for aircraft  observers, are    &quot; similarly worded.   This  is not the  case.  The   order  calling for observers    &quot; definitely states  that observers  will, form one of  the specialist branches in the    &quot; Royal Navy, which are notoriously most sought  for  and which form  the best    &quot; avenue  for  promotion.   There   was  no corresponding  statement as  regards    &quot; officers  applying  for  secondment  or  any  other  reassurances which would    &quot; counteract the widely diffused belief that the Board of Admiralty were opposed    &quot; to the existence of  the naval branches of the Royal Air Force.        &quot; (b.) With any  sign of encouragement from the Board of Admiralty the need    &quot; for  compulsion would  not arise. At the same time  it is difficult to  see why    &quot; &apos; compulsion would be out of the question.&apos;        &quot; There is, in fact, no reason whatever why the terms of entry for future caudi-    &quot; dates for admission to Dartmouth should not explicitly state that Naval Officers    &quot; may be required by the Board of  Admiralty to be seconded for specified periods to    &quot; the Royal Air Force for service  with the Navy.  Lack  of  precedent is obviously    &quot;&quot; no objection, for  dependence on precedent means stagnation.   Air warfare had no
 &quot; precedent 20  years  ago.   Indeed,  the  Air Ministry  are of opinion  that  the I &quot; introduction of compulsory secondment as between all three fighting  services! &quot; would be  a signal step of progress towards the evolution of  a common defence! &quot; doctrine.  Any  and  every step  for  promoting the  further  interchange of! &quot; personnel between the Navy, Army and Air Force cannot but benefit  all three! &quot; services,  and,  what is  more,  by  increasing the  efficiency  of our  defence! &quot; organisation as a whole, make alike for economy and the greater security of  the! &quot; British Empire.      &quot; (c)  and  (d).  The Air  Ministry  do  not  admit the correctness  of  these I &quot; contentions.  Secondment  has, indeed, in the past provided an  outlet for  1 &quot; abler officers of the  fighting  services, of which they have been eager  to avail I &quot;themselves.   Service with  a  Foreign Power or attachment to the Staff College &quot; of  another  service  have  actually  proved  an  avenue of  promotion.   Many &quot; distinguished  names could be cited in this connection, and it is certain that &quot;there has been  no  &apos; feeling of insecurity.&apos;   In the present  case, however,  the I &quot; proposal is not  for  a  few isolated secondments, but for a considerable body of) &quot; seconded  officers working  as  regards  the most important part of their duties I &quot; under the  eyes of senior  officers of their  parent  service.   Indeed, immediately! &quot; below the Admiralty stress this fact to the point of exaggeration, and argue I &quot; that   it   makes  the  secondment  scheme  &apos; incongruous.&apos;   Moreover,  their f &quot;immediate superiors will in many cases be also  naval officers seconded  for al &quot; second period, and a  senior naval officer will be in  command of every  carrier,! &quot; As regards promotion, the Admiralty have the remedy  in their  own hands &quot;making  this secondment rank as a specialist branch,  and by treating officers I &quot; seconded for air work on an equality with other specialists.     &quot; (e.)  This is an  argument in favour of the Air Ministry scheme as againstI &quot; the Admiralty&apos;s proposals.  There will obviously  be a  smaller  increase in the I &quot; Lieutenants&apos; List if  secondment is adopted than  if a separate Naval Air Arm I &quot; is formed, since in  the former event  only 30 per cent, of the personnel  of j &quot; Royal AirForce  units with the Fleet will  be regular  naval officers, as against) &quot; 100 per cent, in the Naval Air Arm.  The block in promotion will be the  morel &quot; serious under  the Admiralty&apos;s scheme  inasmuch  as it apparently contemplates j &quot; running  the Naval Air Arm without any increase  in existing senior commands. [ &quot; This fact is discussed  more fully in paragraph 20 below.   The Air Ministry&apos;s I &quot; proposals,  on  the other hand, will provide an outlet partly by re-secondments [ &quot; and also by occasional permanent transfers (subject  to Admiralty consent) &quot; officers of medium seniority who show special aptitude  for air work.     &quot;(/.)  The  Commander-in-Chief  would  be in  the same position if a newly I &quot; arrived pilot were a naval officer or ex-naval officer whom he had not met I &quot; before.     &quot; (g.)  Lastly, the Admiralty claim  that it is incongruous to second an officer! &quot; to another  service when during the greater part of his time he will be employed j &quot; back on his own service on a man-of-war.     &quot; The-answer to this is that the officer seconded for Air work will  not serve I &quot;the great part of his time  on board, or that if  he does he will be  short of &quot; flying practice.  It is  not according to facts that the naval air service if created &quot;would consist of  air  personnel working  in  ships,  and  expansion to shore bases &quot; of all natures and types is inevitable.     &apos;&apos; The  Air Ministry have thought it necessary to deal at some length with the &quot; objections adduced by the Admiralty to these secondment proposals, which,  in &quot; their view,  offer the best solution to the problem of naval air provision.   As stated &quot;above, they are satisfied that the policy of secondment has never yet been given &quot; a fair trial by the Admiralty.   So long  as  the Admiralty regard the system  of &quot; provision of naval air  units by the  Royal Air Force as an evil to be cured as &quot; soon as  possible, it   is perhaps  not  unnatural that their action  should be  to &quot; refrain from  heartily supporting any measures which,  if  brought to  fruition, &quot; would  deprive  them  of their  most  useful  arguments for restoring a separate &quot; naval air service.     &quot; The  Air Staff are convinced that there would be no lack of volunteers  if&quot; the Admiralty issued  an order making it clear that, subject to qualifications as&quot; an efficient pilot and in the event of being well reported  upon, service with the&quot; Air Force woulrt definitely be reckoned towards promotion.     &quot; It is possible that, following the course already adopted by the Admiralty&quot; in the matter  of  observers,  it  may be necessary to offer additional inducement  I
     &quot; in the form of extra pay.   When the question of pay is readjusted for all three     &quot; services  in 1924 it would  be quite feasible to  differentiate  somewhat more     &quot; between the pay of Junior  Officers  in  the  Royal Air Force and that of junior     &quot; officers in the other services.&quot;                                          : Training.     54. The  Admiralty  raise the  following points  in connection  with  training.&apos;: Firstly,  that the Officers posted for duty with Naval units have :not received sufficient training in  air navigation; secondly, that the course recently laid down by the  Air Ministry for training officers as observers for the reconnaissance, machines was drawn up without reference to the Admiralty, and that, in consequence, the  latter  have been given no  opportunity of  representing  their  requirements  in  this  direction ;   and, thirdly,  that instruction in certain  subjects which are essentially naval is carried  out. at the various technical schools by Air Force officers ; and that the Air Ministry have not asked that Naval Officers should be lent to them for the purpose of imparting such instruction.     55.  Rear-Admiral  Fisher, Chief of  the Staff, Atlantic Fleet,  also  called attention to the fact that the system of instruction in Wireless Telegraphy differed iu  the Navy and  the Air Force, and that,  in consequence, the Air  Foroe officer  doing duty with the Navy was required  to learn both systems.     56.  The Air Staff  explained that steps have recently been  taken to improve  the navigational training of Officers, and that an  improved  syllabus  of instruction  had been drawn  up.     With regard to the instruction in Naval subjects at the various Air Force Schools, it was explained that such instruction was at present given by ex-Naval officers  and petty officers who had transferred to the Air Force.   The Air Staff agreed that when this  supply  became exhausted it would be desirable to obtain  instructors in such subjects on loan from the Navy.                                             uiskp Control of Units Allocated to the  Navy,     57.  The Admiralty agree that  the liaison between themselves and the Air Ministry is on the whole satisfactory.   They consider, however, that  they  are  handicapped by not having  any Air Force  officer actually attached to  the various Divisions  of  the Naval Staff  in the Admiralty building, and they do &quot;not consider that  the  present system  whereby the &quot;Coastal Area&quot; controls the  Naval Air Units is entirely satis- factory.   Admiral Fuller in his evidence referred to this question as follows: -        &quot; While from the Air  Minisi.ry&apos;s point of  view the new arrangement   was     &quot; more  satisfactory as regards administration, the lack of a  link  between  the  two     &quot; services  soon  became  apparent.   The A.O.O.C.A. was not often  able  to give     &quot; personal advice  and  assistance to the various  Admiralty departments.  The    &quot; actual orders for the A.O.G.U.A. are as follows :-             &apos;&apos; &apos; The Air Division of the Naval Staff  has been abolished, and an  Air        &quot; &apos; Force area formed under an Air officer, who will undertake the adminis-        &quot; &apos;  tration and supply of R.A.F. units working with the Navy in Home waters,        &quot; &apos;  together with the  supply of R.A.F. material and personnel to His Majesty&apos;s        &quot; 1  ships at Home ports.                *         &apos;  *                      *       .     *             &quot; &apos; 3.....in addition to the functions described  in paragraph 1, he        &quot; &apos;  shall act on behalf of the Air Ministry as Adviser to the Admiralty on  the       . &quot; 1  execution of Naval Aerial policy as agreed between the Admiralty and  the        &quot; &apos;  Air Council, and in the Departmental preparation of such policy prior to        &quot; &apos;  its discussion with the Air Council.  When, however, it appears that  the        &quot; &apos;  two Departments  differ on questions of principle, the A.O.C.C.A. will  not        &quot; &apos;  be  in a position to act  as independent adviser of the  Admiralty.&apos;        &quot; In other words, he can run the units equipped for  the work of the Fleet,    &quot; but when it came to the question of policy and that sort of thing it was not for ., :&quot; him to discuss it; he had to go to  the Air Ministry.&quot;   .: 58.  The Admiralty state that under the present system  they  have no control overand no knowledge with regard to the progress of training and efficiency of the naval air units except from statements received from the Air  Officer Commanding,  Coastal      [10330]                                                           D
Area.  They can judge of the efficiency by the service rendered, but  have no standardof comparison.     No complaint has been made with regard to the general system of  control whenthe aircraft are embarked, but at such times they are entirely under Naval orders.     59. The Air Ministry regret that  they are unable at present  to  spare  officers forattachment  to the Naval Staff Divisions  at  the  Admiralty.   They agree that such  a practice is desirable, and are prepared to meet the wishes of the  Admiralty as soon asofficers become available for the purpose.     60. The Air Ministry claim that  the present system, whereby the Naval Air units are grouped under one commander, ie., the  Air  Officer  Commanding Coastal Area, isefficient from an administrative point of view.  They point out that this, officer shouldbe considered  the adviser to the Admiralty on all  air matters, with  the exception oflarge questions of policy, which can  only be  settled between the Board  of admiralty and the Air Council.     The Air Officer Commanding Coastal Area is at present an ex-Naval  officer.     It is claimed that this  officer is in constant  touch with the  Naval Staff, who arethereby kept fully informed  with regard  to  the  progress of training and all matters connected with the Naval Air units.Relations and Go-Operation between the Services on Board  a Carrier.     61. Certain  questions  of detail  affecting the  personnel are dealt  with in  thefollowing paragraphs.  The main, difficulties in the  present situation  are  in connectionwith what may be termed  &quot; discipline&quot;  and are  only  experienced  when  Royal  AirForce personnel are  embarked  on the carrier and serving side by side on  the shipwith the men  of another service.     In order to realise what these difficulties consist of, extracts  from the evidence ofCaptain  Calvert, who was  formally in&apos; command of an  aircraft  carrier,  are  given ,atsome length :          &quot; The  R.A.F.  unit  serving in.  an  Aircraft  Carrier  is  under  the Naval     &quot; Discipline Act, and  therefore hypothetically,  there  would appear  to be- no     &quot; difficulties in the application and maintenance of discipline differing from those     &quot;met with-in other men-of-war.  In practice, hoiuever, it  has  been found that     &quot; there are real and ever-present difficulties,          &quot;It should  be  borne in mind that the  fact of placing a unit of  the R.A.F.     &quot; under the Naval Discipline Act does not necessarily inspire  the members of     &quot; that unit with the true spirit of Naval discipline, any  more than the passing of     &quot; an Act  of Parliament inspires the people of a  State with a willingness to  conform     &quot; to the Act.          &quot; One  of  the principal factors  round which discipline  in  the  Navy -as in     &quot; other services is built up is  &quot;pride  of service,&apos;  &apos;Fleet&apos;  and  &quot;ship,&apos; and in  a     &quot; carrier  this factor is quite understandably lacking in that portion of the ship&apos;s     &quot; complement provided by the R.A.F., the latter for the most part having had no     &quot; previous connection with the Navy and neither is their future  bound up in it.          &quot; Again, Naval discipline is adapted to sea conditions and  it has been found     &quot; that  the  best  results are  obtained under a long-service   system, as life in  a     &quot; man-of-war is  admittedly totally different from  life elsewhere, and that  only     &quot; those who become inured to Naval  life by long association with it  can expect to     &quot;&apos; obtain  the highest proficiency.          &quot;The above makes it  evident that the C.O. of  a carrier is at once faced with     &quot; difficulties  owing to  having a separate and distinct  service   on  board, which     &quot; service lacks  the two essential requirements,  pride of ship  and  continuity of     &quot; Naval service  for producing the best results in Naval discipline.          &quot;  The present position  in  a carrier is 2  services-differing in the essential      &quot; factors such  as traditions,  customs,  pay, privileges, conditions of service;  and      &quot; the Captain has to endeavour  to manipulate these into  a perfect fighting unit.          &quot;  The difficulty  of  maintaining  true  discipline  in   a carrier  is further      &quot; accentuated by the  O.C., R.A.F. Unit, being  placed in  the impossible position of      &quot; having to endeavour  to  serve two masters, on  the one hand the Captain of the      &quot; ship, and on  the other  the Air  Ministry through  Air Force channels.   It is      &quot;further pointed out that the  promotion and career of the O.C., R.A.F. Unit,  is      &quot; entirely in the hands of the Air Ministry without any enforced reference to the      &quot; Captain of the ship.
    &quot; It would  therefore  appear that,  provided  the  Air Officer Commanding&quot; ashore reports satisfactorily on the O.C., R.A.F., in a  carrier, the opinion of the&quot; Captain of the ship on his conduct and efficiency is not taken into consideration.    &quot; Further, the 0.0, R.A.F., reports  on the conduct  and efficiency of  the&quot; other  Air Force  officers  serving  in the ship, and these reports do  not  pass&quot; through  the  hands  of  the Captain for approval  or otherwise.  There  is no&quot; guarantee, therefore, that  should the Captain  have had  occasion to correct an&quot;officer, such  reprimand  will  be  taken into account  by  the  0,0,,  R.A.F., in&quot; forwarding his report on the officer.    &quot; In  other words, the  Captain  has the  responsibility for  the  conduct and&quot; efficiency of the  Royal Air Force officers, but he is  not called upon to report&quot; thereon in order to commend for  merit and can  normally only bring incorrect&quot; conduct  to  his  superiors notice when it  is  sufficiently, grave to justify an&quot; application for a court-martial.    &quot; It will  readily be seen how the aforementioned  matters must of necessity&quot; affect  the prestige of the  Captain, as do other conditions consequent upon the&quot; present system.  One of the gravest of them is his probable total ignorance of&quot; air matters on first taking over the command of a  carrier and during subsequent&quot; months while he gradually acquires a certain superficial knowledge,    &quot; It is not reasonable  to  expect that the  highest state  of efficiency can be&quot; obtained where it is common knowledge to all  that the officer in pommand of&quot; the  carrier has no practical knowledge of the work for which the vessel herself&quot; exists.  This defect must remain until this present system is altered.    &quot; The position of the Captain in regard to air operations is an improper one.    &quot; Owing to the Captain having no knowledge of air work, other than general&quot; knowledge obtained during his service in  the carrier, whenever he requires to&apos;&quot; issue  operational orders, he is not only obliged to  consult a subordinate, but&quot; further, he is in the position of being morally  bound to accept the advice given.&quot; It is  admitted that  the  advice given  is the  best  obtainable on  the spot, but&quot; occasions arise well known to all who have held command^-when the Captain&quot; of a ship may have to decide and  act against the advice  of specialists, and in&quot; doing  so he  takes full  responsibility for the  consequences.  Should  such an&quot; instance occur in a carrier, namely, that the Captain has to give orders against&quot; the advice of the O.C., R.A.F., and the operation result in failure, one can well&quot; picture the  serious effects that such action  would have on  the moral of the&quot; officers and men of the Air Force.    &quot; It may be thought that the Captain should authorise the O.C.,  R.A.F., to&quot; issue  all  operational orders  connected  with  aircraft,  this is  invariably the&quot; practice  so far as detailed orders for the aircraft are concerned, but seeing that&quot; all such air  operations are executed in  conjunction with  the  ship, and are&quot; interdependent, it is obvious that  the main operational orders must be issued&quot; over the Oaptain&apos;s signature.    &quot; Quite apart from the above, it must  not be forgotten that the Captain has&quot; the final responsibility for all that takes place  in  connection with the ship, and&quot; he must therefore have the right of control.    &quot; In the application of  Naval discipline difficulties  and injustice arise due to&quot; the following causes :     &quot; (1.)  Lack of  knowledge of Naval procedure by those officers and n.co&apos;s. of            &quot; the R.A. F.  who have not had the necessary experience of life in  a            &quot; man-of-war.    &quot; (2.)  Certain offences not being viewed from the same  standpoint.     &quot; (3.)  Discipline affected by friction  between men of the R.N. and  R.A.F.    &quot; (4.) Naval punishment affecting airmen differently to  Naval ratings this            &quot; might lead to serious  indiscipline when airmen and Naval ratings             &quot; commit the same offence in company.     &quot; (5.)  Oaptain&apos;s power to punish airmen,  but with no voice in the matter of            &quot; award on their certificates.    &quot; (6.)  The most trying position of the  Executive Officer  when junior to the             &quot; O.O., R.A.F.     &quot; Disadvantages of the  present system due to the Air arm of  the Navy being&quot;&apos; administered by another Department include:-     &quot; (1.) The Naval system of manning a ship with ratings from one Port division             &quot;  is not fulfilled, thus doing away with one of the means of stimulating             &quot; esprit de corps.
          &quot;(2.) Lack of uniformity in conditions of pay-prospects  and preferment are                 &quot; introduced within a ship which does not tend towards contentment          &quot; (3.) The Naval Regulations  by which the  Executive  Officer  is  given                   authority over those of any other branch of the Navy is  seriously                 &quot; impeded, and this might result in jeopardising the safety of the                 &quot;ship.          &quot; It is maintained that with the present  system the time of all the flyin:     &quot; officers is not reasonably fully employed when  ,embarked in a carrier, and that     &quot; this is  injurious to the efficiency&apos;of the officers themselves.   It is not suggested     &quot; that this is due to faulty management, but that, owing  to the many days when     &quot; flying cannot and does not take place, there is insufficient work for themt     &quot; undertake on board ; were they naval officers, they could take their share in the     &quot; work of the ship, thus reducing the total number of officers required to  man     &quot; the ship.          &quot; This system is already carried out in  the case of Naval Observers, and     &quot; works quite satisfactorily, and it will  be found that they, at least, average  the     &quot; number of hours spent in the air by the flying officers.          &quot; From personal  experience in command  of  an aircraft  carrier, it  must be     &quot; stated that the results attained were in spite  of the system, and not due  to it     &quot; The present system may succeed to a limited extent, but it  can  never  be  satis-     &quot; factory or truly efficient,  as  its success is almost  entirely dependent on  the     &quot; endowment of tact, forbearance and good humour possessed  by all concerned.          &quot; The Navy claims to be one regiment, composed of officers and men of all     &quot; grades  and branches, thus  making it independent, and able to carry out its     &quot; various major functions without the assistance of personnel  from other sources;     &quot; with its Air arm manned by another service, the Navy  is no  longer in this     &quot; position.  With the  present system  there is dual  control at the fountain head,     &quot; in the Fleet, ship or unit, and  should the Air arm  of the Navy  fail in time oi     &quot; war, it will  be impracticable  to definitely fix responsibility and too late to make     &quot; good the damage.&quot;     62. The  Admiralty also  maintain that the  present system  is  extravagant in personnel, that a considerable amount of overlap exists, and that  the Royal Air Forceother ranks (apart from the pilots, who  have been previously mentioned) are not keptfully employed.     Both Services maintain the maximum number which they each require separately,and a blending of the two into one Service would result in a total saving of numbers.     63. Admiral Sir John  de  Robeck also  drew attention to the difficulties arisingfrom a system under which officers and men belonging  to  one service are called uponto serve  temporarily  under  the code- of discipline and orders  of another service,Referring to the period of his command of the Mediterranean Fleet  he stated :          &quot; To start with, they were trivial and could be  met by arrangement, but the     &quot; points  of  friction  multiplied and  grew  in importance until finally I  was     &quot;  compelled to address a letter  to the Air Officer Commanding in the  Mediter-     &quot;  ranean in  order  to elicit from him his interpretation of Air Ministry orders as     &quot;  regards machines and R.A.F. personnel embarked in one of  His  Majesty s ships     &quot;  of the Fleet that I commanded.         &quot; I. asked him to remark on the following observations i -         &quot; (A.) That the Captain of  a carrier  is Captain of the ship, i.e., commands                &quot; every soul on the books of  his ship, and is  personally responsible                &quot; for their conduct, efficiency and safety.         &quot; (B.) That the carrier  &apos; Pegasus &apos; is a unit of the Fleet under my command,                &quot; and that to her  Captain  alone  do I communicate  my wishes  and                 &quot; orders,  and that  he  must have  all necessary power and authority                 &quot; to carry them out.         &quot; (C.) That as Commander-in-Chief 1 cannot admit the  right of any other                &quot; authority to administer any ship  or unit under my orders.          &quot; (D.)  That all proposals for improvement in type of machines &quot;carried oi                &quot; methods employed must come to me as Commander-in-Chief for;&quot; approval.  The carrier in war or peace-which  is a  preparation foi                 &quot; war-has to  cany out the intentions of the Commander-in-Chief,                 &quot; and her efficiency and equipment are matters that concern him and                 &quot; him alone in  the  same way as the equipment and efficiency of any                 &quot; other unit, whether battleship, destroyer or submarine.
         &quot; Question (E) is not quoted, being unimportant.         &quot; (F.) Service communications between A.O.C. ashore and S.O., R.A.F., afloat                 &quot; in carrier should be restricted to technical matters of detail, more                 &quot; important matters being addressed to  the Commanding  Officer                 &quot; following the usual practice of the Royal Navy.         &quot; The  answer that  I  received  from  the Air Officer Commanding  in  the     &quot; Mediterranean was  as follows :               &quot; &apos;  I regret  very much that I am unable to accept the observations which         &quot; 1 you give as indicating the principles governing this very important question.              &quot; &apos;  I give this as an  instance  of the  irreconcilability of a very  natural         &quot; &apos; point of view of a Commander-in-Chiel&apos; afloat with that of a senior Air officer         &quot; &apos; ashore who is not under his orders.&apos; &quot;     64. With regard to the correspondence mentioned by Admiral Sir John de Robeck in the preceding paragraph, the Secretary of State for Air has  explained, in his paper dealing with the evidence  given before the Sub-Committee (N.D. (R) 12), that as soon as the Report  on  this question was received from the Air Officer Commanding, the Air Ministry hastened to express agreement  with practically every claim that Admiral de Robeck put forward, and  that the correspondence  was forwarded to the Admiralty, and that the matter was settled amicably without any suggestion from the Admiralty as soon  as it was  brought to the notice of the Air Ministry.     65. Both  the Air Staff and Wing-Commander  Kilner, who gave evidence  before the Committee  at their 3rd Meeting, are unable to agree  with many of the  points put forward with regard  to the relations and co-operation  between  the Services on board a carrier.     66. With  regard to the question of overlap, the Chief of the Air  Staff  makes the following statement (paragraph 76, 3rd Meeting):         &quot; There  is no  overlapping, but the  great point 1 want to make here  is that     &quot; from what  we have seen  so far of aircraft  on a carrier, and comparing the     &quot; conditions with those in a great shore workshop, the men are more fully employed,     &quot; working much longer hours doing  their work, the fitters and riggers  on the    &quot; machines,&apos;than anybody has any idea.&apos;    Wing-Commander  Kilner also explained  that overlapping  between  the  technicalmechanics of the&apos;  two services did not exist,  since  the  type of material dealt withdiffered materially between the services.  For  instance,  to deal with an  aeroplaneengine required totally  different training from that required for a marine engine.    Be  further pointed out that in certain details, such as blacksmith work, he relied on naval ratings to do the  work, whereas the Air Force mechanics frequently did work with motor boat engines.    67.  He did not agree  that the Air Force personnel on board ship had much timeto spare, and emphasised the fact that in time of war, when flying was constantly beingcarried out, the personnel had almost more than they could do.    Moreover,  it was the practice, when the carrier went into port for any  length oftime,  to remove the machines and personnel to a shore base, from which flying practicewas continued.    68.  He explained that the Royal Air Force personnel did take their  share in thegeneral  duties  of the  ship,  and were under the orders of  the  captain of the ship, who could give instructions for them to  carry out  any duties he might wish.    69.  He did not consider the fact that the Royal  Air Force served under the  naval discipline  Act  when on board ship presented any difficulty, and was  most emphatic inhis statements  that the present system appeared to him to work  perfectly smoothly.    70.  The following is an extract from this Officers evidence :         &quot; Wincj-Commander Kilner:  Air Force units in the  ship are under the  Naval    &quot; Discipline Act and  as  such  the Captain is  entitled  to give directions for the    &quot; employment of personnel, particularly where it affects the safety of  the ship,    &quot; that  is,  fire, collision,  abandonment of ship  and stations.  That  is  definitely    &quot; organized  and orders are issued by  the  Captain to  his second-in-command.    &quot; When it comes to questions of  actual flying,  the Captain directs  the Air Force    &quot; to can)&apos; out  the operations as ordered by the senior Naval  authority.   The    &quot; senior Flying Officer acts  in  accordance  with those instructions, directs      [103301                                                            E
    &quot; the Pilots  and  engine men and  others  who  are  to be employed on these    &quot; operations.   When there is  no flying going on the Air Force men have to keep    &quot; parts of the ship clean.  We take  part in the parades of the ship.  We man    &quot; certain boats and, when it comes to any work  being  required in  motor boats,    &quot; the Air Force men lend a hand and overhaul the parts if need be.         &quot; Lord Peel:  When the  Captain gives  orders  to you, you would say one of    &quot; two things, either &apos; I cannot do  that because  I have  received orders  from the    &apos;.&apos; &apos;  Chief Air Officer of the Fleet to fly,&apos; or would you use some strong expression    &quot; or do what you were told ?         &quot; Wing-Commander  Kilner: If I considered that it was going to be a waste    &quot; of machines or life or be an abortive operation, I would point out that it would    &quot; be unwise to carry out  the operation.                                      ,         &quot; Jjord Peel:  But if he gave you the order, you Would carry it out?         &quot; Wing-Commander  Kilner: I would.  I would be bound to carry it out.&quot;And again at a later stage:           Lord Weir: And may I put it this way, is  goodwill sufficient  to overcome    &quot; most  of  the  difficulties and. would  goodwill practically overcome  all  the    &quot; difficulties?         &quot; Wing-Commander Kilner: Yes, but I  do not see any difficulties.         &quot; Lord Weir: You mean  you do not have any difficulties?         &quot; Wing-Commander Kilner: I do not see any difficulties.&quot;    71. With regard to the  question of  the Confidential Reports on  Officers.  TheChief of the Air Staff expressed his willingness to allow such reports in future to pass through  the Captain  of the  ship  and the Naval  Commander-in-Chief  before beingforwarded to the Air Ministry.    72. The  Air Staff maintain  that  if  their  scheme whereby  Naval  Officers  areseconded to the Air Force  were put into practice wholeheartedly a proportion of senior naval Officers would have in time obtained  knowledge of Air matters which wouldobviate  the difficulties  arising at present from the  Captain of a carrier being ignorantof questions relating to the Air.    73. Questions such as &quot; pride  of ship,&quot; &quot; pride of Fleet&quot; and &quot; pride  of  service,&quot;which were touched upon by  Captain Calvert  in his evidence, as well as other mattersof a kindred nature, are in reality  intangible, and,  as such, scarcely open to argument.Such things undoubtedly exist, and must be given due weight in proportion to theother factors when consideration is given to the problem. (C.) THE  ORGANISATION  WHICH  IS PROPOSED BY  THE  NAVY FOR                             A NAVAL AIR  ARM.    74. It should be made quite clear at the outset  that the Navy do not desire toestablish a separate Naval Air  Force.  They wish to set up  a Naval Air  arm on similar lines to the present Submarine Service, the Naval Air arm to be entirely underNaval control and officered and manned throughout by Naval personnel.    75. To quote from  the evidence of Lord Beatty  (paragraph 3.1, 2nd Meeting) inreply to a question addressed  to him :          &quot; Of course it is not an  independent  Air  Force ; that I want putting quite    &quot;  clear.  We are not setting  up a Naval Air Force, but what  we are doing is to    &quot;  have a Islaval Air arm.   It is not a force, it is a  mere arm.&quot;    Originally the main change proposed by the Admiralty was  confined to the region of personnel, and the alterations suggested  with regard to the materiel side of- thequestion were but slight.  Later the Admiralty put forward proposals with regard tothe organisation of  the supply  of Air  materiel, in which it is suggested that  theresponsibility for supply should be removed from the  Air Ministry  and undertaken bythe Admiralty themselves.    The Admiralty have explained that their original  proposals were made in order tomeet what they supposed to be the views of the  Air Ministry and Cabinet and with theidea of making  as little dislocation as possible, but that, though ready to  give theseproposals a trial, they greatly prefer their later scheme (N.D. (R)I)).
ii c[10380]E 2 Design,  Research Work and  Supply  of Materiel.     76.  With regard to the design, research and supply of technical materiel, it&quot;&quot; was at first suggested that  the  present system whereby the Air Ministry are responsible for these services would remain unchanged.  The Admiralty  would insist,  however, on being  represented by  Naval officers attached to  the departments concerned at  the Air Ministry.  Given such representation, the Admiralty would be prepared to accept responsibility  for any  failure which  might occur  at  any  time in the  machines or equipment supplied to  them.     77.  Lord  Beatty&apos;s views  on that suggestion  were  expressed  as follows (para- graph  71, 2nd Meeting):          &quot; What I should say would  be this, that the Air Ministry is the home for Air     &quot;  progress,  Air research, design and experiment  and everything else; that we     &apos;&apos;  have representation there of those  who  have  not got  the   same technical     &quot;  knowledge of the advanced nature that the Air  Ministry have, but to represent     &quot;  the Naval requirements, and they go  to them  and say : &apos; We want  a  machine     &quot;  &apos; capable of being put on board ship, and  capable of doing this  or that,&apos; and       the Air  Ministry say : &apos; We have not one at present.  We will work out a design       for one.   We think we can do it,&apos; and in  time they say:  &apos; WTe have got  one     &quot;  &apos; now that will satisfy you if you  will look at it.&apos;   They look at  the design, and     &quot;  the Air  Ministry say: &apos; We advise this,&apos; and they will not only design, but will     &quot;  provide it.&quot;     78. The supply of  non-technical stores,  equipment and  materiel, which are at present ordinary articles of store in the Navy, would  be obtained  from naval sources of supply.     79. As previously  stated, however, the Admiralty  are desirous   of  undertaking their own supply.     It is proposed that the questions of  research and design should be dealt with by a Joint  Committee on research  and  design, on which the three  Services would be represented.     The  maintaining  establishment, which, in the case of  aerodynamical  research should be  the Air  Ministry, would  carry  out the  researches, and   the  authorised representatives of the other Services concerned would have access to  the maintained establishment  to observe the progress of work in which they were interested.     The  full proposals  are&quot; contained in Paper N.D. (R)  9. Supply of Personnel.     80. The whole of the personnel, both officers and men and  their reserves, would be drawn  from Naval sources.   It is not intended to draw any personnel  from the  Royal Air Force.     81. The immediate reserve of fully trained officers required to replace casualties would  be drawn from (a) officers on  the Active List who, having already completed a period  of service with the Naval Air Arm, would at the moment be employed oa general duties  in the Navy and could be replaced by general service officers from fthe general reserve; (6) retired and emergency lists of regular officers;  (c)  Royal  Yvaval Reserve ; and  (d) Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.   The detailed proposals witfn regard to this question are contained  in Appendix (E)  of the Summary of the  /Admiralty case (N.D. (R) 17.) Training.     82. The  Naval  officers  selected for duty with the Naval Air  arm;  would  not commence to specialise  in air work until  the  age of  22.   Up to  that  age th ey would be trained in Naval matters  entirely and would have acquired a thorough grounding in &quot; Naval knowledge &quot; and  obtained the requisite &quot; sea sense.&quot;     At the age of 22, the Naval officer would receive preliminary training in flying at an Air Force establishment and  on completion of his initial course  would) be posted to a Naval aerodrome for specialised training in Naval air functions.       t     83. It should  be mentioned that it  is proposed that these aerodronnes which, at present, are maintained by the Air Force exclusively for  the use of NavM Air units,should  be transferred to the control of the Admiralty.    84. On completion  of his  training he would be  posted  for duty witp a Naval Air.unit, in which  he would serve for two years.                           I    He would  then return to  &quot; General Service &quot; for two years, after whJicih he would

(c. i  Lack of knowledge of Naval Officers of the aircraft work of the fleet.A ^higher standard of discipline attained as follows :-       There will be a deeper esprit de corps.       The naval officers and men who undertake the air work  of the Navy          will have the traditions of the Navy behind them.       The officers and ship&apos;s company of the aircraft carrier will have the          same traditions and common customs.  ( d.) The. time of officers and men will be fully occupied.(a.) again return to the Naval Air arm for a further period of two years. . He would then he employed in a more senior appointment in the Naval Air arm or in general service.     He would then have reached the age of 33  and the rank of Commander, and his &quot; active &quot; flying service would be over.     85. Subsequently a proportion of such officers would be employed as Captains oi carriers, in  command of shore aerodromes or in staff appointments in connection with air work, and it is considered that a percentage would  ultimately rise to Flag rank.     86.  It is maintained that this system would result in due  course in providing a proportion of senior naval officers who possess a knowledge of air matters.     87.  The Admiralty would rely on the Air  Ministry for the  training of technical ratings and certain other special courses.     A summary of their proposals is as follows :      (a.)  The training of air mechanics and technical ratings to  be carried out in Air            Force establishments,     (b.)  Medical tests for flying fitness.  Naval Medical officers would undergo training            in this subject at the special  Air Force Hospital at Hampstead.     Training of Officers.     (c.)  In aerial gunnery             To be carried out in the  Air Force schools.     (d.) In aerial navigation             To be carried out under the Admiralty-            aerodromes.     (e.)  In aerial  fighting             To be carried out at the  Air Force School.     (/.) In aerial observation             To be  carried out  under the Admiralty probably  at  one  of  the  Naval                aerodromes.     (g.)  In aerial photography             To be carried out at the  Air Force schools.     8S.  It  should  be noted, however, that the  above  proposals  were put forward at the same time as the proposal that the Air Ministry should  be responsible for Supply, If, however, a  &quot;clean  cut&quot; is to  be made and  the later suggestion whereby the Admiralty carry out their own Supply is adopted, it is presumed that the  Admiralty will assume the responsibility for the whole of the  training and will no longer rely on the Air  Ministry  to  carry out  any  instructional functions.  No alternative training scheme on these lines has as  yet been put forward by the Admiralty. Control- of Naval  Air  Units.     89.  Since  the  whole of  the personnel of  the proposed Naval  Air arm would be drawn from-the Navy, the control of the Naval Air units, both  when on  shore  and afloat, would rest entirely with the Admiralty.IHie  Effect of the  Admiralty Proposals on the Personnel on  Board the Carriers    - .90.  If  the  Admiralty proposals are accepted, the  wdiole of the  personnel will heNaval.   The existing difficulties uf  co-operation between  the two Services on  whichthe AdnAiralty lay so much stress would therefore automatically cease to exist..     91. &quot;The following are the advantages which  the Admiralty  consider would be gained by)the adoption of their proposals :      (1.)  &quot;Inhere  will be no loss of efficiency due to          \(a.)  Dual control at the fountain head.
(e.) The investigations of offences  and punishments will be viewed, from       the same, standpoint.(/,) A common divisional system.&apos;g.) The ship will be manned by men from one port division.(h.) Similarity of uniform.(i.) The same  standard of  privileges throughout  an  officer&apos;s or  man&apos;s       service irrespective of where he happens to be serving.(j.) The elimination of those found,  unsuitable for  air work by reverting       them  to general service.   (This takes  place  in service in sub-       marines.)(7c.) An  ever-present  stimulus for  the personnel concerned to  study  all       work connected with the Navy so as to be prepared  when no longer       required for  air work           (Specialists reverting to general service.) (I.) Uniform conditions of prospects of preferment.(m.)  Good  ground  work  in  seai requirements from first  entry, greatly       facilitating a pilot&apos;s and observer&apos;s training for work in connection       with ships (sea  instinct).(n.) Specialisation  in air work at sea only  and not, as at present possible,       frequent changes to air work of totally different type on land.(o.) Economy due to the reduction in  personnel for the  same amount of       work accomplished                (D.)-THE AIR STAFFS OBJECTIONS TO  (C).    92.  The Air Staffs  objections to the organisation proposed  by the Navy may be best indicated by the inclusion of statements made in evidence by (a) the Chief of theAir Staff and (b) Air Vice-Marshal Sir W. G. H. Salmond, Air Member for  Supply and research.    The former deals with the organisation as a whole and the question of personnel and the latter with the materiel side.&quot; (a.) Evidence of the Chief of the Air Staff.    93.  &quot; First and foremost, to my mind, anything that  tends  to draw the three&quot; Services closer together is an  advantage  to the nation, and anything  that tends to&quot; separate them into watertight compartments is a disadvantage to the nation, from, the&quot; defensive point of view.    94.  &quot; Secondly, a new menace has arisen to the British Empire, and that is the&quot; air menace ; not only to the British Isles,  but to their overseas trade, and it seems to&quot; me that the security of these islands  against  air attack is  the most important of&quot; air defence problems, even at the present moment, and will  become more and more&quot; important in the future.   This being so, nothing should  be done that would militate&quot; against the effective organisation of our Air power as a whole.   In addition, we feel&quot; that all naval battles and the. majority of naval operations will be carried out in the&quot; vicinity, or within reach, of shore-going aircraft.  I could give my reasons at  length&quot; why fleet actions  in the  middle of  the Atlantic  and Pacific are improbable if the&quot; Committee want a paper on this subject.    95.  &quot; If this is so, it will mean that aircraft that the fleet will carry, and which is&quot; practically limited by the number of carriers, though a few may be carried in battle-&quot; ships, will be attacked and will have to be supported by aircraft based on shore.  It&quot; would  be very difficult to provide this support to a separate Naval Air Service trained&quot; and brought up in a different language and carrying out different tactics in the air&quot; and with a different conception of air work from that of the central and larger Air&quot; Fbrce.  I want to emphasise how  essential it is to have unity with regard to air&quot; strategy and air training.   It is impossible to separate the carrier work from the land&quot; work in any way in  any sea, except in the middle of the Atlantic or Pacific.  In&quot; other words, we feel that it is much easier for an Air Service  working in one element&quot;  the air to co-operate with another Service working in another element the sea &quot; than it would be for one Air Service working in the air  to  co-operate with another&quot; Air Service working in the air, which is what it amounts to.   I hope the Committee&quot; will give me a chance to explain this at much  greater length on a future occasion&quot; and to submit a paper.
     96.  &quot; The last reason is that  it is  absolutely essential  that the  aircraft of a fleet&quot; should be based on a shore station, and wherever it goes it must have a shore station.&quot; For instance, if it goes to  Japanese waters it must have a shore base; if  it goes to&quot; Singapore  it must have  a shore base ;  if it  goes to the Mediterranean it would be&quot;; based on Malta.  If it goes to the north of the British Isles it must have a base ; east&quot; south  or west of England it must have  a  shore  base.  I would  take the case of&quot; Singapore.  It is necessary to put troops and  guns on. shore, and if the Army have&quot; their separate Air Service they will have their spotting machines for their  big guns.&quot; Are they going to have shore aircraft belonging to the Army or  under the Separate&quot; Air Service ?  The Navy  will have to have their aircraft based on  shore, and if the&quot; Independent Air Force is responsible for the  superiority of the  air, it must  have&quot; theirs too three different services, talking three different languages, and brought up&quot; in three different ways.     97.  &quot; Finally, we hear  it said: &apos; How can the Fleet be up to a one-power standard&quot; &apos; when their air belongs to a separate service.?&apos;  I would ask anyone to look at the&quot; facts.   Are we not,  so far as the Air units working with the Fleet are concerned,&quot; more efficient and powerful at, the present moment than any other nation ?   No other&quot; nation  has  the carriers that we have, and at the  end of the year we shall have three&quot; more.          ******     98.  &quot; It is not understood  what economy&apos;would ensue in officer personnel if Naval&quot; officers replaced Royal Air Force officers  in carriers.   You must remember it is most&quot; inadvisable that  you should  use your pilots for naval work.  If they are to be used&quot; for flying they want to practice flying constantly.  Some economy might be made in&quot; peace  time, though  this  is most inadvisable owing to the expense  of carrier flying,&quot; provided it was accepted that  only a certain proportion of the very limited numbers of&quot; machines carried are manned for peace purposes, i.e., that the carrier was  regarded&quot; as a nucleus unit, but as you  have only one carrier at present, and are only going to&quot; have five, I do not  think that will ever come.  In war time no economy can result.&quot; Owing  to the very limited numbers carried,  each machine must have its full crew,&quot; who  have  no other work  except the care of their machines and instant readiness to&quot; take  the air for prolonged periods when required.  Think of the man who should be&quot; on watch and be is up in the  air and does not come back-it is impossible.  It never&quot; could be  clone.   A  pilot  cannot fly and do  watch-keeping work with the ordinary&quot; officer  on the ship.  To   use pilots and  observers in war time on watch-keeping or&quot; other ship&apos;s  duties when not required  to be in the air would inevitably lead to&quot; lamentable breakdowns on the  part  of  the personnel, and would  be unjustifiable&quot; misemployment of valuable personnel.&quot;(b.)  Evidence of Ah-  Vice-Marshal Sir W.  G. H. Salmond.     99.  &quot; The system would  be  discredited as soon as a  fatal accident occurred to&quot; to naval personnel through some defect in  a  machine  supplied by  the Air Ministry,&quot; I have  been through so many crises myself as  an Air Officer Commanding through&quot; that sort of thing happening,  and the only reason I have been able  to  get  over that&quot; difficulty has been the fact that I have been able to say that the people responsible for&quot; supplying the machines to our people are people  belonging to the same service as the&quot; user, belonging to the same service as the pilot.   Because they know that  they have&quot; sufficient  confidence when these appallingly difficult situations  arise  through a&quot; breakage in the air to carry on, but I cannot conceive myself, and 1 know  this thing;&quot;, will happen, it must happen,  when a machine breaks in the air, assuming that the&quot; Navy were flying an Air Ministry machine, however greatly they may feel now that&quot; they  would accept Air Ministry machines, that they could ever again, once  that thing&quot; had happened, carry on with that acceptance.   The morale of the  service is involved&quot; at once.  You get that extraordinary feeling coming up if distrust in the machine and&quot; it is the most difficult thing the Air Force has  ever had to  compete  with in the past&quot; This is one of the greatest difficulties  I foresee.  1 feel that the system  would  be&quot; discredited as soon as a fatal accident occurred to naval personnel through some defect&quot; in a  machine supplied by the Air  Ministry.  Secondly, complaints  and suggestions&quot; about  equipment would  presumably  be  sent,  through the  usual  channels to  the&quot; Admiralty  and then  would pass  to the Air Ministry.  Owing to the  fact that the&quot; Admiralty  wTould not have the technical knowledge to review such complaints and&quot; suggestions, the Air Ministry would be inundated with suggestions, and complaints&quot; of all kinds, some good and some bad;
     100. :&quot;- The advantage  of the present system is that complaints and suggestions &quot; by users have to pass through senior officers who are experts  thoroughly conversant &quot; with air questions before  they finally reach the Air Ministry, and consequently action &quot; can be taken immediately.   Any  systein dealing  with such delicate instruments as &quot; aircraft which increases the time before corrective action  can  be taken, is not only  dangerous to life but unsound.  Thirdly, apart from accidents, everyone who deals with &quot; aircraft knows  how numerous are the modifications put forward by pilots and how &quot; carefully they have to be  considered before they are adopted.   If these modifications &quot; were put forward by Naval  personnel they would either be accepted or rejected ; in &quot; the latter case, lengthy  correspondence  and  friction  might easily  result.  All &quot; modifications have to be considered in  the light of their effect on supply,  and it might &quot; well be that a modification  adopted owing to  naval  pressure  would result in great &quot; expenditure and loss of inferchangeability.          ^                                   %s           -fc    101. &quot; The modifications which are  put forward and  which  would be pressed by &quot; the Admiralty are not necessarily  ones -which fit in with the  general scheme of &quot; aircraft and spares and  stores as  developed, and  we would  constantly, I presume, &quot; be  having to refuse certain  modifications which would only cause  friction and &quot; unhappiness, because they would not understand why we refused them, and if  we &quot; explained it  they would say &apos;  we wish  we were running our own.&apos;    102. &quot; Lord Weir: Is  it not this ?  You would  then  really have two technical &quot; authorities for the same questions  and  they might not agree.    103. &quot; Air Vice-Marshal Salmond:  I am afraid it is bound to result in that.  The &quot;design1 of  machines and engines is based upon the most intimate personal touch &quot; between the  design staffs  and the users.   It is  clear that this  cannot be maintained &quot; if communications on such  questions have to  be made  between two  Departments &quot; of State.   If the personnel in the Navy were using our machines and we  had to &quot; go through the Admiralty, I have  to get a report  through  the Admiralty as to &quot; questions on which they would like  progress in one  way or another.  I should lose &quot; that intimate personal touch which at present flows absolutely direct up from the pilot &quot; using the machine right through to me.  It is one channel.  If I have to go through &quot; the Admiralty in order to  get my information I lose my contact with the pilot who.&quot; is using our machines, I cannot have that personal touch which, in my opinion, is really &quot; vital to progress and efficiency and safety in the Air Service.    104. &quot; Lord Peel: The only way out is a separate establishment for the making &quot; and designing of these aeroplanes  for each  Service, is it not ?    105. &quot; Air Vice-Marshal Salmond:  That is  the  only alternative I can see.  The &quot; other one I think must lead to it.    106. &quot; Lord  Peel:  You mean if the  personnel  is once   handed  over  to  the &quot; Admiralty the inference is that you must hand over construction and design?    107. &quot; Air Vice-Marshal Salmond:  It must follow.  I do  not see  any way  out &quot;  not if the user of an instrument on which life and death  depend is not under the &quot; same control as the producer.    108. &quot; Lord Weir: You mean the questions which arise at present in regard to the &quot; line of contact, which is on personnel, are really trivial in your view compared with &quot; the questions which would arise  when  you brought back  the line of contact to &quot; materiel ?    109. &quot; Air Vice-Marshal Salmond :  That is what I feel.  Then in war, if the war &apos;&apos; was a great war and the whole resources of the country had to be put forward, you &quot; would have,  unless some very close co-ordination existed in the past, which I cannot &quot; conceive would happen,  the two  great departments  contesting for their own type &quot; of materiel, you would at once have different aircraft, spares, different types of engines &quot; to supply in large  quantities, and the  arrangement for development and expansion &quot; would  be  exceedingly  difficult  with the various firms concerned, and unless there &quot; was some very strong controlling body there would  be enormous  competition &quot; between the  two departments  to try &quot;and get the orders to the best producing  firms. &quot; I am now going into the question  of expansion  for war purposes on the basis that &quot; the country which we might be up  against would  be France, and the  organisation &quot; which has to be gone into in order to supply the demands, such as  are required  for
&quot; the Air Force  first of all on the basis that  there  is  a  one-power standard, and  we&quot; have to keep up that wastage for a one-power standard, and  consequently of having&quot;to expand very largely on the one-power standard, which is  most complicated, with&quot; all the various parent  companies that exist; but if  we had someone else butting&quot; into  this  arrangement,  and not necessarily agreeing with us, although  we were  the&quot; dominating factor in the situation, it would be exceedingly difficult, I could very well&quot; foresee, to make any real proper scheme for  expansion.  Then another difficulty I&quot; foresee is that, under present arrangements, whatever is allowed in materiel to  the&quot; Navy is thought out by us from two points of  view: one is the  exhaustion of  the&quot; reserves,  and,  secondly,  the substitution of those  reserves, should the demand prove&quot; too much, by some  machines which  we could place in from the  pool that is,  the&quot; total number  of aircraft which  we keep of different types.  Of course that line of&quot; thought and  provision  would presumably cease  unless adequate steps were made to&quot; overcome  that  point.  Engines in particular, I think, would be a difficulty.  During&quot; the last war the demand for  engines  went up in  power, and no doubt they would&quot; under this new Board, and  we. should be forced in  war to go  back  to the same&quot; organisation, I think, after going through  a period  of great inefficiency to support&quot; them.&quot;                               &quot;     (NOTE. The evidence of Air Vice-Marshal Sahnond was taken before the proposals\of the Admiralty with regard to the organisation of their  own supply (N.D. (R) 9) hai\been received and circulated to the Sub-Committee.)     110. As previously stated,  this paper is intended to be  a Summary of the evidence given by the various witnesses before the Committee.     In addition the Admiralty and Air Ministry  have themselves prepared exhaustiveisummaries  of their cases which  have been circulated as papers  N.D.  (R)  17 and in.D. (R) 18 respectively, and which  contain matters of considerable detail, including,for example, detailed  analyses and criticisms on  the  financial effects  of the  various proposals, and also  recapitulate many of  the points brought out in evidence andalready referred to in the  present paper.     Should it be necessary to refer to the more  detailed proposals and  criticisms ofthe two Departments, it is suggested that those papers  should be read  in conjunctionwith the present document.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,       July 14, 1923.

This is dealt with in Part I of this paper.                                 PART I.    The great principle on which the Admiralty base  their case is :     THAT  THE ADMIRALTY SHOULD BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE  EFFICIENCY OFTHE FLEET.   2. In the problem of Imperial Defence the Admiralty are  responsible  for thesecurity of the sea communications, and this security is achieved by means of the -Fleet, which consists of units working on the surface, above the surface and below the surface.  The responsibility for all. such units must rest with the Admiralty.   At the present time the Admiralty have not full control of the unit for dutyabove the sea, namely, the Fleet Air Arm, with the result that the Admiralty cannot   held responsible for its efficiency, thereby destroying this fundamental principle.   3. In opposition to this principle on which the Admiralty base their case for aseparate Fleet Air Arm, what principle has been advanced  by the Air Ministry ?   None   ....  unless the statement &quot; that it  would not he in the interests sir h.of the country that there  should be a separate (Fleet) Air  Arm&quot; is  to be accepted ^&quot;mvWas such.      &apos;                                                                  MTG.,8.

The considerations in support of this statement will now be carefully examined.     4. The Chief of the Air Staff in his evidence advances three considerations.     The first consideration is :         &quot; First and foremost, to my mind, anything that tends to draw the thru     Services closer together is an advantage to the nation, and anything that tends     to separate them into watertight compartments is a disadvantage to the nation,     from the defensive point of view.&quot;     Now one of the insurmountable obstacles of the present system is the frictioncaused both on the administrative side and on the executive side in the Fleet and onboard the  Carrier.     This friction inevitably has the very opposite effect  to drawing the Servicestogether.     Further, the present system places the Air Force in a  watertight compartment,inasmuch that  Naval Officers get no  practical knowledge of air work and are, not ina position to judge the true value to be placed on the Air Arm of the Fleet.     5. The second consideration put forward is :         &quot; Secondly, a new menace  1MS arisen to the British Empire, and that  is the     Air Menace; not  only  to the British  Isles, but to their overseas trade, and it     seems to me that the security of these Islands against  air attack is the most     important of air defence problems at the present moment, and will become more     and more important in the future.  This being so, nothing should be done that     would  militate against  the effective organisation of  our Air  power  as a     whole . .  .  .&quot;     THE  &quot; EFFECTIVE  ORGANISATION OF OUR ALR POWER  AS A  WHOLE &quot;  CLEARLYENVISAGES DEVELOPING THE FLEET  AIR ARM WITH A VIEW  TO AIR DEFENCE OF THEBRITISH ISLES, INSTEAD OF FOR DUTY WITH THE  FLEET.     This can only be carried out by withdrawing aircraft from the Fleet  or to a lesser extent by failure to provide Reserves of both personnel and machines to make good losses in war time.  This clearly demonstrates the vital necessity of removingfrom the Air Ministry every vestige of control of the Fleet  Air  Arm.     The necessity  of safeguarding  the British  Isles  against  air  attack &quot;is  notquestioned, but neither must the security of the Empire, which rests mainly on theFleet, be disregarded.   Again, defence of  overseas trade is an  Admiralty responsi-bility.  This question is one of great  complexity, and  the Committee will realisefrom an inspection of the chart of the world which has been at their disposal, andwhich shows the ocean trade routes, how small a part the Royal Air Force can play in the defence of Oversea Trade.     With  the  Channel trade diverted Northabout, any air menace  to our  overseatrade must be met by  the Fleet,  of which  the Fleet Air Arm forms part; the onlyexception to this is the mouth of the Thames.   In this respect,.therefore, there canbe no justification for maintaining a United Air Force at the expense of the Fleet, on whom the  additional burden falls.     It is not comprehensible, moreover, why the  removal of the Fleet Air Arm, whichis  about 5 per cent, of the Royal Air Force and which cannot be-taken into account for the Air Defence of  the British Isles, should jeopardise the efficiency of  theremaining  95 per cent.   In fact,, judging by the evidence which  has been given as tothe difficulty of providing the  additional personnel necessary for an expanded AirForce, it would appear to be all to the advantage of the Air Ministry to be relieved of the onus of providing the personnel for the Fleet Air Arm.     In  this connection, it is pointed out that Naval Officer  personnel is drawn froma  different source, viz., Dartmouth,  entry at  an  early age, so that  it would notinfluence the entry of  Officers to the  Royal Air Force, as the latter join at a  muchlater age.     6. The third and  last reason put forward is:         &quot;  That itks absolutely essential that the aircraft of a Fleet should be  based     on a shore  station, and  wherever  it goes it must, have a  shore station.&quot;     So  far as an aerodrome, not necessarily of  a permanent type, is concerned, thisis  agreed to, and where possible it is proposed that Fleet Aircraft should use RATAerodromes, and vice versa  the Royal Air Force might possibly  make use of the fewNaval Aerodromes.
3m    It is well to remember that in war time it is likely that the Fleet will have toprovide itself with a base, such as Scapa Flow in the late war or the Elliot,Islands.inthe Russo-Japanese War, and included in the requirements of the base will be suit-.able ground  for an aerodrome.    7.  After an examination  of  these three considerations, the Admiralty claim that no great principle for a Unified Air  Force  has been produced.    They have searched in vain in the evidence adduced before both committees  forany other arguments which might be held as questioning the vital principle for whichthey are contending, namely, that the  Fleet Air Arm, being an integral part  of  theNavy and employed with other  arms for securing the safety of our  sea communica-tions, must be operated, administered and controlled by the authority responsible  forthese communications the Admiralty.    It is  true that one member of the Air Council stated that to give the Admiralty Air Marshalsuch responsibility might seriously call into question the necessity for the existence IJX CR)&apos;,of a separate Air Force.   This statement has  been confirmed  by the Secretary of 6thMtg.,230.State for  Air in N.D. (R) 12.    Should this question be raised, there is no doubt that it will be dealt with on its merits,  as must be the present point at issue, and in any event the fighting efficiency of the Fleet is  in its importance  something far above the existence  or not of aSeparate  Military Air Force.    In considering questions of the magnitude of the - present case, first principlescannot be  ignored as suggested by the Secretary of State for Air in Paper N.D. (R)  12.                                 PART  II.   -    Reasons showing why the  Present Scheme is unsatisfactory and that its                         Failure in War is  Certain.    The main reason why the present scheme is not satisfactory is because it is basedon divided control, and no fighting force  can attain maximum efficiency  where thisis the case.    2.  The following examples  confirm,the above statement:     (a.) Air Ministry estimates and not Admiralty estimates determine  policy and          development of the Fleet Air  Arm.  In plain  language, the  Admiralty          are never certain of having their requirements realised, as it depends on          whether the Air Ministry estimates-are sufficient to&apos; meet them.  Develop-          ment cannot make rapid progress as long as  such uncertainty exists.    Also, whilst this uncertainty exists, it is impossible for the Admiralty to make          out with confidence either their strategical dispositions or to place full          reliance on the Fleet Air Arm tactically.,    (b.) The Admiralty have no control over the design of aircraft for the Fleet Air          Arm.              N.B. The Joint Technical Committee deals only with  the fitting                  out of ships with the necessary appliances to carry aircraft, and                  not with aircraft design.    (c.) Specialised Naval training, except for the period  on board  the Carriers, is          the sole responsibility of the Air Ministry.    (d.) The appointments of  Officers and drafting  of airmen is  entirely in the          hands  of the Air Ministry.   Thus, on the outbreak, of war, with the          consequent expansion of the Air Force, it is highly probable that Senior          Air Force Officers may be withdrawn from the Fleet in  order to supervise          the training of newly-formed Air Force units.    (e.) The careers of the Officers and men carrying out the work of the Fleet Air          Arm, both on board the Carriers and in the Coastal Area, are  entirely in          the hands of the Air Ministry.    (/.) The Admiralty have no control over Reserve of personnel or machines.    3. The Admiralty maintain that the friction, absence of the spirit  that obeysorders cheerfully,  offences against  discipline and misunderstandings in  regard  toprospective action, that in time of peace may be  no more than a source of  annoyanceand discomfort to those primarily concerned, may, in the conditions of actual warfare,lead to the partial or complete failure of some important operation.   The numerousinstances  in  the past in&apos; which this has  happened in combined  Army  and  Navy     [10186]                                                         B  2
          operations are a warning of what is certain to happen under the present system in          Naval operations which depend on the co-operation of an Air Force Unit.              To quote the words of Major-General Sir Frederick Sykes in N.D.-35, page 5                   &quot; A system cannot rely entirely on goodwill.   Though in  all matters, and              especially in those of such magnitude, goodwill is essential, a sound system is              mainly  dependent upon good organisation and correctly placed authority.&quot;              4. It is clear, therefore, that at all costs the friction must be removed from the          operational zone, even should it be transferred to the administrative and supply side,          a contingency which the Admiralty consider  is sufficiently guarded against in the          proposals which they have put forward.                                            PART III.             Reasons  showing why Seconding is unsound in  Principle and  Application.              During the proceedings of the Sub-Committee &quot; seconding, &quot; in various degrees          has frequently been referred  to  as a possible means of producing a satisfactoij          scheme.  In reviewing any seconding  scheme the primary consideration is,  will it          remove  the  main  reason for  the  failure of  the  present  system, viz., &quot;divided          control&quot;?   The Admiralty contend that &quot;seconding,&quot; even when carried  to t          extent of officering the Fleet Air Arm entirely by seconded Naval Officers, cannot i          this.                      -M&apos;D&apos; (^R&apos;MIH      2. The  evidence given by Admiralty witnesses is strongly to the effect  thatvicSe&apos;-Marahai  seconding would not meet the case, and the evidence of one of the principal witnesses2i9T222&apos;     0^ ^e Air Ministry is  also largely against it.              3. Why Seconding is not a Solution of the Difficulty.   It would not do awaj          with divided control because                 (i.) Naval Air Policy would still be dependent on Air Ministry  estimates.               (ii.) Specialised Naval training and daily training practices, other than those                       carried out from  Carriers, would still remain in hands of Air Ministry,              (iii.) Appointment of Officers and drafting of airmen would still remain with                       Air Ministry, even though they are Naval Officers appointed for ships                       of the Royal Navy.              (iv.) Admiralty would still have no control over the flying careers of the Officers                       of the Fleet Air Arm.               (v.) Admiralty would still have no&apos; control over development and maintenance                       of material for Naval Air purposes.              (vi.) Admiralty would still have no control  over reserves of  personnel or                       machines.4.  Why Seconding is Unsound in Application.(ft.) Seconding was tried in 1920 at a favourable time, as the Lieutenants list      was crowded and reductions were inevitable, but there was no response.(&amp;.) If volunteers should not come  forward compulsion  would be out of the      question.(c.) A seconded Officer  has a feeling of insecurity, as his immediate superiors      belong to another Service who are not responsible for his future.(d.) In the-Navy,  where  promotion  is competitive throughout  the Service,      seconding to another Force can never be popular,  and the best  Officers      will not volunteer, with the result that Officers in the higher ranks of the      Navy with Air experience will not be of the highest quality.           Secondment  of the type suggested is entirely different &quot;to the  second-      ment which obtains in the Army from one regiment  to another, and where,      promotion is  by seniority  in the  regiment  from  which the  Officer is      seconded.(e.) There will be a considerable increase in the Lieutenants list, which will mean      blocking promotion in the Navy unless a  proportionate increase in the      number of Officers in the senior ranks of the Navy is also allowed.(/.) The  Commander-in-Chief will  have  no practical  means of  judging the      flying efficiency of a seconded Naval Officer until he arrives&apos; on board the      Carrier, and his first flight may be on active service.
     5. Apart from all the above reasons is it not incongruous to second an Officer to another Service, when  during the greater part of his time when seconded he is to be employed in men-of-war and serve in his own Service ?     The seconded Naval Officer,  though camouflaged  in R.A.F. uniform, will still be a Naval Officer at heart,  but he will have to camouflage this fact also, if he is to appear on the surface as successfully serving two masters.     This can only lead to inefficiency and lack of progress.     Appendix (A) gives the Fleet  Order  calling  for Officers to volunteer  for secondment to the Air Force, which resulted in no response.     Appendix (B) gives the Fleet Order calling  for Observers, who remain under  the Admiralty, and for which there  was no dearth of applications.     These Appendices are reproduced to refute the  statement of&apos; the Air Ministry witness that the Admiralty  had  not whole-heartedly  endeavoured to find volunteers for secondment.     It will be noticed that both  the above orders are  worded in accordance with the usual procedure.                                 PART  IV.                          The  Admiralty  Proposals.     In reviewing the  Admiralty  proposals, the necessary considerations are :      (1.)  Will  they give the Admiralty full control of the Fleet Air Arm?     (2.) Do the proposals remove the  deficiencies of  the present  system?     As regards (1)      (a.)  The personnel will be composed of Naval ranks and ratings, who voluntarily          give their  services under the control of  the Admiralty, the User service.                   (For details of personnel scheme, see Appendix (D).)     (b.)  Research  and design of material will  be carried .out by a  Joint Research          and Design Committee, on which the Admiralty are fully represented.              The Admiralty  will be responsible  for passing specifications for          . Naval purposes.              The responsibility for supply will, rest with the Admiralty, the User          service.   Full information will be found in N.D.  (R) 9.     (c.) Reserves of personnel and material will be maintained and controlled by the          Admiralty.              (For details  of Reserves of Personnel, see Appendix (E), and for          provision of Aircraft  Reserves, see Appendix (F).)    2.  It will  be seen that in (a), (b) and (c) above the Admiralty have  full control,with the result that (2) the deficiences of the present system will be eliminated.    The initial training in Air work and certain specialised  training for a propor-tion  of the personnel will be carried out by the  Air Ministry, and Air  CommodoreSteel has admitted  that there will be no difficulty in  doing this.    This  appears  to  be  the only point where there could be  friction, and theAdmiralty on their  part do not admit that there need be any.    It will be recalled  that the initial training of Officers of the Royal Flying Corps,both  Naval and Military Wings, was carried out at  the &quot;Central Flying School,&quot;Upavon, without friction, and at  the time the Naval Wing was composed entirely  ofNaval personnel, officers and men, they being under the control of  the Admiralty.    3.  During the enquiry, various statements have been made by the Air Ministrywitnesses, or points have arisen  on which the Admiralty have not  so  far had anopportunity to  fully state their views.    A summary of these points is given below, and in Appendix  (C)  will be found the Admiralty  view thereon :      (1.) The Co-operation of the Fleet Air Units  and the Navy  is  erroneously          compared with combined Naval and Military  operations.    (2.) Necessity for  an Officer who has Air Forces under his command possessing          practical knowledge of Air work.    (3.) Difference  between an Air Force Unit serving with the Navy and with the          Army.    (1) That, if the Fleet Air Arm is part of and administered by the Navy, it will          be inferior in quality compared with the Royal Air Force.
 (5.) That the Naval officer pilot will not be so efficient in airmanship as the       Royal Air Force pilot. (6.) Employment of pilots on ship work. (7.) That the Royal Air Force personnel of a carrier are fully employed. (8.) Reconnaissance observers. (9.) Spotting observers.(10.) Observers in general.(11.) Training of units when not on board a, carrier.(12.) The necessity for the &quot; Producer&quot; being in touch with the &quot; User.&quot;(13.) Removal of aircraft from the Navy.(14.) Complaints generally and development of Naval aircraft.(15.) That all Naval battles and majority of Naval operations will be carried out       within reach of shoregoing aircraft.(16.) Showing the standard of education  and training in science and engineering       reached by a junior Naval Officer.                                  PART  V.                 Economy resulting from Admiralty  Proposals.    Economy will lie in the fact that, with complete confidence in the Naval air arm, reductions  in the^Navy as a whole may become possible which would not bepossible were such confidence lacking.    2. Direct saving will also result from the differences in cost under the  following heads :-     (a.)  Personnel. As shown in evidence at N.D. (R),  5th Mtg., a saving in           personnel can be effected in the Carriers.  Personnel at aerodromes will           remain as  at present.  The  saving under this head  will amount to            37,892.    (b.)  A further saving under this head is probable owing to economies resulting           from the employment  of long-service Naval personnel, which cannot be           calculated.    (c.)  Material.- The actual cost of material will remain about the same.    (d.)  Administration. A saving will be effected in the administration of the           Fleet  Units  amounting  to   20,346.   An  increase  in  the  cost  of           administration of supply is expected, amounting to  12,872.    (e.)  The total saving,  therefore, which can be calculated amounts to  45,366,           This sum  will be  increased to  78,441 when five  Carriers of aircraft           carrying capacity equal to &quot; Furious &quot;  are in commission.    3. (1.)  In addition to the saving shown in paragraph 2, there is the probablesaving due to employment of long-service Naval &quot;personnel already referred to.    (2.)  Considerable saving over the transport of  stores and equipment.    (3.)  Saving by the use  of  storage accommodation in Naval Dockyards  and establishments.    (4.)  Saving by the use of Dockyard facilities in repair work.    (5.)  Saving in the original construction of  Carriers,  due to  the amalgamation of workshops, repair machinery and store rooms.    4. Economies are more fully discussed  and  the figures given in this paper are-explained in Appendix (G).    Naval Staff,  June 12, 1923.
APPENDIX (A).                 ADMIRALTY  FLEET ORDER NO.  2011A (1920).                        R.A.F.-Volunteers for Loan.                         (C.W.  10108/20-3.7.1920.)    Applications are invited from Officers who have completed their examinationsfor Lieutenant and have been granted Watchkeeping certificates to be  seconded tothe Royal Air Force under the  following conditions :     (i.) Period of attachment to be for three years.    (ii.) The majority of this period to be spent  upon Naval Air  work, and with          the Navy.    Officers so  loaned will be graded as &quot;Flying Officers&quot;  on joining,  but if theyhold rank  in the Royal Navy  higher than Sub-Lieutenant, they will  be  grantedhonorary rank in the Royal Air Force, equivalent to their Naval rank.    During their service with  the Royal Air Force they will carry the rank, pay and authority of their substantive Air Force Grading for all Air Force purposes.    They will  be eligible for  substantive promotion to  Flight-Lieutenant as soonas they qualify as  pilots,  such promotions being made by selection according tovacancies.    They will wear the Service  uniform of their Royal Air Force rank (or honoraryrank, if held) and the full dress and mess dress of their parent Service.    Officers so loaned may not return to their parent Service except with the approvalof the Air  Council, who reserve the right to return any Officer to his parent service at any time should he prove unsuitable for aerial duties, or for disciplinary reasons,and should the  Council consider such a course desirable.    In the event of any Officer so loaned desiring to obtain a permanent commissionin the Royal Air Force, the Air Council will, if they consider the Officer or Officersin question suitable, make proposals  to the  Admiralty to  this  effect  as  thesecases arise.    It will be necessary for Officers loaned to the  Royal Air Force to be medically examined by the Special Aviation Medical Board as to their physical fitness.    Applications should be forwarded as soon as possible through the usual Servicechannels to the  Admiralty.APPENDIX  (B).                     ADMIRALTY FLEET ORDERS, 3502/21.               Observers Volunteers for Training as Report.                          (C.W. 14229-28.10.1921.)   The Board has  decided to make Observers a Specialist branch  in  the  royal navy, similar to specialists in Gunnery, Torpedo, Navigation and  Signals.   2.  The details of the scheme are as follows  :    Number required. For the present, eight officers will be selected each half-3&apos;ear,       and although junior Lieutenants of two years and upwards will generally be       selected as in other specialist  branches, a few Commanders and Lieutenant-       Commanders are  required immediately for training.   Courses. The courses will commence in May and November each year, and each       course will be of seven months&apos; duration, viz. :            Two  months&apos;  preliminary training at the Naval Schools in Gunnery       and Signals, and- five months at the Seaplane Training  School at Lee-on-       Solent.
Pay, &amp;c. While under training with the R.A.F., Officers will receive the full    pay of their Naval rank, with extra remuneration as laid down for Officers    under training, viz. :         For each actual day of ascent during the period of such training :-            Commissioned Officers      ...       ...    ....       3s.        After qualifying, Officers will be eligible for appointment as Observers    in Aircraft Carriers in the  Royal Navy, and when actually detailed for    such work-will receive, the allowances laid down, viz. :         For  periods  during  which they  are actually  detailed  as Trained    Observers :-        Commissioned Officers              If  qualified in  Wireless Telegraphy (per diem)       6s.             Otherwise  (per diem)      ...       ...       ...       4s.Uniform. Officers  will retain  their Naval rank and will wear Naval uniform    while undergoing their course of training.Employment. On  completion  of the seven months&apos; qualifying course, Officers    will be rated Probationary  Observers and will be appointed to Fleet Carriers    for further  training, and on completion of six months&apos; training, which will    include a course at Leuchars,  will be  eligible  for  confirmation  on  the    recommendation of  the  Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet.
                    REFERENCE THE FLEET AIR ARM,  PART  IV.(NOTE. Appendix &quot; 0&quot; contains the 16 points enumerated iu the Fleet Air Arm, Part IV, paragraph 3.)                                                         Admiralty Remarks.or  fullletails.Extracts from Evidence  or  Points        that have arisen.1.The Go-operation of the Fleet Air Units and the Navy is erroneously compared with                   combined Naval and Military Operations.  The Air is  a different profession,just as much a different profession asthe Navy is to  the  Army, and  I  donot think because the Navy has  toco-operate occasionally with the Army,I do  not understand or know thatthere   are  proposals  between   theAdmiralty  and  the   War Office,  asthey have to work a  bit  in co-opera-tion, that the  Naval Officers should do a fair amount of training with theArmy and vice versd.  The result of what you say wouldbe this, do not let these Naval Officers,high  or low, bother&apos;  about what theairman can  or cannot do.  Let themrely  for  their  knowledge  on  theadvice - of   the  airmen   they   haveattached to them ?  I think that solution  is  the  best way of doing it.  The air is not a specialist function in the same way as gunnery or sub-marine work ?  I say distinctly not.  May I put it this way?  I emphatically say thatwhen it comes to these co-operations of the Navy with the Army there isnever any idea of the Naval  Officerhaving to spend a long  time  in theArmy and the same  on the other side,the Army versus the Navy.[10186]  This evidence:   (1.) Compares the  occasional co-opera-tion  that takes  place between the navy and  Army with  the  Air  co-operationrequired of the Fleet Air Arm ;  (2) and states that the best solution is  that naval officers  should  have  no practical  know-ledge of air work whatsoever, as  the  airis not a  specialist function.  As regards  (1), it  is  at once apparent that  the circumstances of each case are ona totally different footing for the following reasons:   (a.) The Fleet Air Arm is a portion ofthe  permanent  armament of  the Fleetsimilarly to its guns  or any other weapon,it is  not an occasional requirement of theFleet.  (6.) In   Fleet  operations  the   Carrierwith aircraft  is an integral  part  of theFleet, just as  are  Destroyers or Sub-marines.   The  Fleet Air  Arm does notoccasionally associate with  the Fleet, ashappens when the Navy and Army uncler-take a combined operation.  As regards (2):   (a.) How can it be maintained that theair,  so far as the Fleet  is concerned, isa life  study  for all  connected with  it,when half of  the R.A.F. Officers servedfor 4 years only ? (See  Sir  Hugh Tren-chard&apos;s evidence, question 40.)  (b.) The Admiralty intend thatapropor-tion  of the Naval Officers, who specialise,will  remain as  specialists to  administer the Fleet Air Arm.   These  Officers will,however, serve for occasional periods, intypes of craft other than  carriers, in orderthat  they may keep  suitably  conversantwith other arms of the Fleet.  (c.) Tn  times  of war,  all  men-of-wardown to  aDd including  Light Cruiserscarry aircraft.   Does the  Air Ministryseriously  contend that  the  Captain  of
  From  the  above examination it wappear to be incredible that Naval Oishould be doomed to continue in ignorsof this weapon and that the &quot;Air&apos;remain  a closed book to  them  as iscase at the present time.2.Necessity for an Officer who has Air Forces under his command possessing Practical                            Knowledge of Air Work.  &quot;The  policy of the Air  Ministry*all through the late war has been that every man who  is in command  hasbeen a. flier, because one of the draw-backs  during  the war  was airmenbeing ordered  into  the  air  by their staff officers who had had no experience in the air.&quot; (Quotation from Sir HughTrenchard&apos;s  evidence  at  N.D.  8thMeeting, pp.  21 and 22.)  * NOTE.-The  Chief  of  the  AirStaff uses  the words  &quot; Air Ministry &quot;wrongly,  as  this  Ministry did  not exist till just prior to the Armistice.The term, however, implies those re-sponsible for administering the  AirForces during the war.  The present arrangement whereby naval Officer has to give orders to Air?without himself having had practical teexperience  is  entirely  opposed  to Ipolicy.  The Captain of a  Carrier, who hgive orders to the R.A.F., suffers,from!very drawback pointed  out  by theCliof the Air Staff.  The Captain of the ship has frequetito originate orders for flying exercisesiitraining.   All  orders do   not  originfrom the Naval Coramaader-in-Chief.  It is on these  occasions,.viz., when tCaptain originates orders, that umbragecaused.  Whenever a flight  takes place the Gitain has to decide whether the conditimare suitable.  Such factors as   (a.)  Ship rolling or pitching,  (6.)  Low clouds,  (c.) Visibility,  (tl.)  Weather conditions generally!ticularly for extended flights),  (e.)

3.Difference between Air Force Unit serving with the Navy and with the Army.  That there is little or no differencebetween  an Air Force Unit  serving with either the Navy or&apos;the Army.There are great differences  (a.) An Air Force Unit afloat is really a unit serving within another unit, a  ship,hut a similar unit ashore serving with theArmy would be  a unit attached  to theArmy.  It would not on shore be broughtentirely within the orbit  of the primaryforce, as is the oase&apos;afloat.  (6.) The Army is  composed of a numberof regiments, and  the  Air Force  Unitsattached may be looked upon and aclminis-tered in the  same way as the various unitsthat compose an army.  From the above it is clear that, thereis liable to  be  much less friction  ashorethan in the life  of close contact in a ship.  (a) The Air Force1 units that operate with the Army  are carrying  out  dutiesover  the land  from  shore  aerodromes,which is in keeping with  their normalenvironment and duties.  The air work required  by the Fleet isof a more specialised nature and furtherremoved from ordinary flying duties than is the air work required  by the Army.                                       4.That if the Fleet Air Arm is part of and Administered by the Navy it will be Inferior in                   Quality compared with the Royal Air Force.  That if the Fleet Air Arm is partof and administered by the Navy, itwill be inferior in  quality comparedwith the R.A.F. inof  Carriers  andbe Naval  Officers A  proportion  of[10186]  The Staff to administer  the Navy&apos;s air arm will be composed  of  Naval officers who  have  specialised  in  flying.   the commanding  OfficersNaval Aerodromes willspecialised in  flying.Naval Officers will do duty with the fleet air  Arm  practically throughout  their service, as do a  proportion of  Officers inSubmarines.   Joint research and designas  proposed in  Admiralty scheme will ensure progress in technique and also thatthe Admiralty and Air Ministry both reapthe advantages of experience gained.  TheNaval Air Arm will have the benefit of the professional departments of the Navy toback  it.   At  present this knowledge isnot made use of by the Air  Ministry.  There  will be  a spirit  of  competition which will stimulate  the Naval Air Armin its progress.   The Navy is  not afraid of this  competition.  As it  is  proposedthat all   preliminary and  some special training  of the Naval Airmen  should be                             C 2
That the Naval Officer Pilot will not be so Efficient in Airmanship as the Royal Air ForceN.D. (E), 8th Mtg.Lord Peel, 112.Lord Balfour, 128.

Assuming there-                                     fore that the Naval Officer serving  in a                                     Carrier  averages 140 hours flying a  year,                                     viz., double  the average  given  for the                                     Officers  of the Air Force as a whole, it is              ..                      obvious that there will be ample time for                                     him to undertake some ship work.                                       (6.) It is pointed out in (a) above  that                                     there are  many Officers in  the Air Force                                     who, owing to the nature of their employ-                                     ment, are unable to  practice flying, but                                     these Officers eventually return to active                                     flying squadrons and again take up flying,                                     and quickly  regain their former efficiency.                                     This clearly  demonstrates  that  flying is                                     not an art that  is easily forgotten after it                                     has been once acquired, and that therefore                                     Naval Officers  can, similarly to Air Force                                     Officers, dispense with  flying for  certain                                     periods  and then take to it again.                                       (c.) During the war ,it was found  that                                     the morale of pilots detoriated if they were                                     allowed to loaf about without reasonable                                     occupation when no flying was in progress,                                     and in  consequence on shore they  were                                     given employment   in  such matters  as                                     supervising  work of the  camp, superin-                                     tending transport, - overseeing the  con-                                     struction of dugouts, &amp;c, and, in addition,                                     it was  often  found necessary to organise                                     games   and  other recreatioi when  there                                     was  insufficient   service  employment                                     available.looks  to  the  Navy for his  life  career.Half of the Air  Force  Flying Officers, onthe other hand, are short-service  officers with no previous Military training and no definite career, their work  with  the  Fleetrepresenting a passing phase of  their life.Surely their ability to&apos; perform  this workcannot  compare  with that of the naval officer.

It is common knowledge on boalCarrier that the majority of the  R.FOfficers have insufficient work to do.naturally causes ill-feeling, as the conJmerit of Naval Officers is cut down sofall are fully employed.8.Reconnaissance Observers.S.D. (B), 7th Mtg.Air CommodoreSteel, 459, 461.  Air  Ministry consider ah  elementshould predominate in an observer forfleet reconnaissance.  Reconnaissancecould not be effectually carried out bythe part-time Naval Officer.  (a.)

Naval  element should predominate    This  is  practically an  admission thatin observers for spotting.              the Naval  Officer is the more suitable for                                     spotting duties.  Thinks a proportion of the SpottingObservers for Navy should be naval officers.cance of a vessel or vessels sighted andtheir  movements, it is essential that  theOfficer  doing   this  duty  should  haveintimate Naval training  and  experience and further  that he should be personallyknown by his superior so that apportionatevalue may be placed on the reliability ofhis judgment.   (6.) From (a) above it will be seen thatthe  principle  on  which  observers  aretaught in the R.A.F. is on entirely wronglines for Naval requirements.   (e.) Another  great  difference  betweenreconnaissance work ashore  and afloat isthe means by which reports are made.   in work over the land, the machine can returnto Headquarters and the observer makes a verbal report, this enables the Staff to get into  close personal communication withthe observer and examine him fully.  Thismeans is not practicable at sea, as even ifa Carrier is available to land  on, too much time would be lost in the process owing tothe rapid, movements of Fleets and Ships.At sea important reports  must be  made immediately by W/T.  (d.) Even  should  the  reconnaissanceobserver working over the land, make useof W/T, his doing so will not imperil  theArmy or  give away valuable informationas to its  position  or  movements,  whichmay  be  the  consequences of  incorrect useof W/T at sea.   (e,) The Sub-Committee might like tosee Atlantic Fleet Air Order  112, whichwill readily convey the intricate nature ofthe duties of a reconnaissance observer.   (/.) The   Admiralty  have, repeatedlycalled the attention of the Air Ministry tothe fact that they were  dissatisfied withthe reconnaissance  observers, and that we wanted our own.

(E), 4th Mtg.Air Vice-MarshalVyvyan, 32.  The next point I come to is aboutthe training of Fleet Units when noton  the Carrier.   Aircraft can only take  on or  off&apos;  when a Carrier isunderway, and owing to  the  expenseof keeping Carriers under steam, aswell  as  owing  to limitations of the weather, it is impossible to keep FleetUnits efficient unless  they also do agreat deal of practice from shore bases.While  they are  on shore they are under Air Force discipline and carryon  training under the control  of the coastal Area.  (a.) This speaks for  itself,  and pilclear  language  an  example  of  the!control of the present system,  nameljfwhen the R.A.F. Unit leaves  the sliijthe shore for training it no longer iqunder the Naval Discipline Act.  To give  a practical example of Imay occur in consequence :       E,&apos;  A Fleet exercise takes place, costinjcountry  a large  sum,  and  during ithe aircraft of  the Fleet Carrier icertain  particulars.  The Command!Chief informs the  Captain  of the Cland orders  him to take action to Ithe aircraft crews  in their  failings. ICarrier returns to harbour and the Idisembarks to a base aerodrome if (available, in which case  the  Captaiijonly request the Air Officer Comma:ashore to carry out  the intensiverequired;   the   Unit  is  thus  emlremoved  from  the  control of  themander-in-Chief for the  daily  aerofltraining on  which their  efficiency Mdepends.   (6.)  In considering the  example;in  (a) above, it  may  appear to the!Committee that this defect still prevathe proposed Admiralty scheme, owijthe Air  Ministry continuing  to  can]certain  portions of  the  trainingNaval Air  Arm.  The  two eases ailparallel, as the Admiralty scheme pro!that the Air Ministry should carry oilinitial flying training  and  certain snair instructions  only and not the s]jor  advanced training  required  forwork.-                            10.
The necessity for the &quot; Producer &quot; being in touch with the &quot; User.&quot;  Referring to his being in a positionto get in touch with  the &quot; User &quot; ofthe machine, says: &quot; I think it couldbe,  but, after all, he is not my officer.I cannot send for him in the same way that I can send for anybody now and investigate a complaint.   I mustgo through the Admiralty.&quot;  (a.)  It is thought that if the Air Minis-try consider that the &quot; User &quot; of a machineshould belong to the, same service as the&quot; Producer,&quot;  surely it is essential that theNavy who is  the &quot; User &quot; of the Air Armof the Fleet  should be  the &quot; Producer.&quot;At the present  time  the Navy is in  no sense the &quot; Producer &quot; in either personnelor material.  (6.) The Navy feel similarly placed indealing with  the R.A.F.  Units  that the air marshal feels  in dealing with the individualNaval Officer, namely, that &quot; after all theyare not  our  officers,&quot; and when failureoccurs, criticism is  resented, as  coming from the Naval Officer who has no practical experience of Air work..(R), 3rd Mtg.,-190. Sir Hughmilliard.               13.Removal of Aircraft from the Navy  Referring to aircraft:   The Naval ones are different to theother types, but  we cannot withdrawanything  from  the.  Navy  withoutAdmiralty  concurrence or the  WarCabinet  overriding   it.    We  candefinitely, and are prepared to, lay it down, as  far  as  we can, that. wecannot withdraw a single thing givento the  Navy without their  concur-rence.  (a.)  This can  only apply  to  Aircraftactually on board the Carriers in practice the  Admiralty   have no  control  over&apos;machines on  chore  in  Coastal Area or over reserve machines.  The Air ministry have to supply an Independent Air force as well as supplying the Navy.   If bothNavy and R.A.F. have heavy losses intime of war, it is quite possible that theNavy  will  not  get  the  machines  orpersonnel it requires  to  make good the losses.   The machines in reserve  for theNavy i.e., 100 per cent, reserve can beremoved   by  A.O.C.C.A.&apos;s  order.    Asregards the &quot; general pool reserve,&quot; mostof these  machines are unsuitable  for usein Carriers without large alterations beingmade to adapt them for ship use.  The  machines  of  the  Fleet  may there-fore be non-existent  at a critical  momentshould the  Air Ministry decide that the call of  the R.A.F. on reserves  is the more urgent of the two.   This  is an instancewhere  the Air Ministry  can override theAdmiralty in the requirements of the fleet air Arm.[101S6J  (.6.) This exemplifies the great differencebetween the Marines and R.A.F. Units forNavy.  Admiralty have complete  controlover the Reserve of Marines.                                        12.

It may be  argued that the range of  air- craft will greatly  increase  from  year to year, and, in support of this, Mr  Marshal Trenchard, in  an  Air  Staff  Memorandum containing his  views, dated  January 1921, and handed into  the Sub-Committee of Committee of Imperial Defence, appointed to take evidence  on the question of the Capital Ship in the  Royal  Navy, stated  : &quot; At present  the extreme radius of action may be put  at 500 miles,  but this must inevitably increase .... it is not there- fore ,too much  to expect  that in the com- paratively near future,  say,  within  the next  10  years, larger types  of  heavier- than-air craft may have a radius of action approaching 1,000 miles.&quot;   As a set-off  to this  somewhat sanguine prophecy, the  Admiralty direct attention to a Memorandum by the Air Staff, dated January  1923 2  years  later-on  &quot;The Proposed Treaty  of  Mutual Guarantee,&quot; paragraph 4, which reads:   &quot; The present effective  radius of air operations  from a base maintained in peace is  somewhere in the  neighbourhood of  200  miles.  It is only within this radius that immediate air assistance  could   be  afforded   by  anv Power   ft cannot be maintained that craft with greatly  extended  radius  of  action  can rapidly be produced on  the outbreak of war, as only those machines which have been  perfected in  peace which means that a machine has been built, tested,  and jigs,  tools and  drawings made for rapid production-will be able to take part in a war of moderate length.    In the Great War  it took 3  years  to  produce  a  new type. .  A consideration  of  the foregoing leaves no reason  to  anticipate that  an increase  in  the range  of  aircraft  will necessarily  bring  the  scene of  futuremajor actions  within  reach  of our  own shore-going aircraft.  Should  by any chance shore going air-craft  belonging to the Independent AirForce  be  able  to take part in a majoraction, it  is  very necessary to realise how they would do  this.  Firstly, it would benecessary  to have an  easily  recogniseddistinguishing mark on our ships, other-wise  these shore-going  aircraft  will  bebombing  or torpedoing our  own ships inmistake for those of the enemy. Secondly,these shore-going aircraft will have to be                              D 2

From  the foregoing  it will  be seenthat the education and. training of a naval officer at,  the  time he specialises in flying-has   provided  such  a  foundation  in engineering  science that  he will find nodifficulty  in applying it  to  the  specialsubjects involved  in   Aviation,  and  forwhich a year&apos;s course  will  be ample. .  6. It is vitally important to remember that the Technical Officers  required forthe Air Branch  of  the Navy will be pro-vided by the Engineering and ConstructorBranches,  -whose training is far in advanceof any training that could be  given in a2  years&apos;  course  such  as the CranwellCadets undergo.  7.

APPENDIX  (D).                         FLEET AIR ARM (PERSONNEL).                        Provision of Naval Air Officers.    THE total of 350 Air Officers which the Committee  have suggested as a basis on which to show the flow of Air Trained Officers into the  higher ranks of the Navy,appears to be greater for the Fleet Air Arm than is to be expected  for some timeto come.    It does not seem probable that the number  will be over 200 within the next fewyears, nor is it expected, if the total number of Carriers permitted by the washington treaty is built, that as many as 350  will be required actually serving in the FleetUnits!    Any  reduction  below 350 will,  however,  cause  a   corresponding  reductionthroughout the figures given in this paper.    Although therefore a total of 350 has been assumed and worked to in this paper,the above consideration should be borne in mind.    2. The Admiralty propose that, after training in flying, Officers of Lieutenantsrank should serve as follows :          1st Period     ...       ...       3 years as Air  Officer.         2nd Period     ...       ...       2 years General Service.         3rd Period     ....       ...       4 years (average) as Air Officer.    If no allowance is made for  wastage, the number of  Officers serving  in eachperiod at any given time would be in the proportion of 3-2-4, but owing to wastagefor various causes and the fact that a certain number of Officers will  wish to revert to the general list permanently on the completion of the first  or second periods,  theproportion of Officers in the first period will in practice be greater and the proportionin the third period less.    Assuming that one-half  the Officers who commence the first period  of servicego on to the third period, and allowing a wastage of 10 per cent,  per annum duringthe first period and 5 per cent during the third period, an allowance which is con-sidered to be sufficiently liberal, the proportions would be  approximately 4-2-3.    The figures 4 and 3 represent Officers serving in. the Fleet Air Units and  thefigure 2 represents Officers serving at sea on general duties.    If 350 officers are  serving in the Fleet units, there will, therefore, be roughly200 in the first period  (air),  100 in the second period (general service) and 150 inthe third period (air), making a total  of 450 trained Air Officers,  apart from officers who have been trained  in air work, but have permanently reverted to general service.    With these numbers, it is calculated that, in time, 20 per cent, of the more senior officers on the Lieutenants&apos; and Lieutenant-Commanders&apos;  lists, will have completed,at one time or other, both of  the periods of air service,  while  in addition  a further16 per cent, will have completed, at one time or other, the first period of air service.    Assuming that these officers receive the same share of promotion as others onthe list,  the percentage of air-trained  officers  on the Commanders&apos;, Captains&apos; andFlag  Officers&apos; list will be the same.    Thus, if the numbers of the higher ranks are increased proportionately to  theincrease  in the number of Lieutenants and Lieutenant-Commanders, there would bethe following numbers of Senior  Officers all of  whom, at one time or other, have completed both periods of service  as Air Officer :              Flag  Officers     ...      ...       ...       ..;       19             Captains         ...      ... ^     ...       ...       55             Commanders     ...      ...      ...       ...       90    It is not possible to forecast accurately at the distant  date when the Fleet Unitsreach the size requiring 350  Air Officers, how many of these  Senior Officers-will beemployed at any  date on Specialist Air work.    But, at a rough estimate, it is considered that 50 per cent, of the Commanders,20 per cent, of the Captains and 10 per cent, of the Flag Officers would be so employed.
rx    If this be so, it is reasonable to expect that  the employment of Senior naval officers who have served their full period as Air Specialists would be as follows :                                                              Available for                                                             Employment in                                                Naval Air      General Naval                                               Appointments.     Appointments.          FlagOfficers   ...      ...       ...        2             17          Captains      ...      ...       ...       11             44          Commanders   ...      ...       ...       45             45    It is calculated that if the number of Lieutenants and Lieutenant-Commandersallowed on the Active  List are increased by 350, the total number  of Flag &quot;Officersand Captains allowed on the Active List will be :            Flag Officers     ...       ...       ...       ...        92           Captains        ...       ...       ...       ....     271    Therefore  the  proportion  of  Ex-Air  Specialists  available  for  generalAppointments, to  the total  Lists will be :            Flag Officers     .........      17: 92=1/5           Captains        ...       ...       ...      44:271 = 1/6APPENDIX  (E).                        FLEET AIR ARM  (PERSONNEL).                         Reserves of Officers and Men.    Reserves are required for         (a.) Replacement of casualties.        (6.) Expansion after the outbreak of war.    As regards  (a), an immediate reserve of fully trained Officers will be required.    It is intended.to find  the necessary numbers from         Active List.        Retired and emergency lists of regular Officers.        Royal Naval Reserve.        Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.    Active  List. There  will be 100  trained Air Officers serving in  their secondperiod on general duty.   Within a short time of the outbreak of war, it will bepossible to relieve them by general service Officers from  the general reserves of theNavy and thus have them  available.    In addition, a certain number of Officers, not in their second period, who havereverted to general service within the last  3 years would be similarly available.    Emergency  List of Regular Officers. It is estimated that 7 retirements perannum will take place from  among the 350 Officers actually employed in the FleetUnits.  Of the 21 who have retired within the last 3 years,  it is assumed that one-halfwill be available (say) 11.    To these might be added a  similar proportion of the Officers retiring during thesecond period (say) 3.    R.N.R. and R.N.V.R. The remainder of the immediate reserve of Officers willhe drawn from these lists.  Under existing arrangements R.N.R. Officers, besides the usual  training courses  in the  G. and T. Schools,  are allowed  to serve for12 months in sea-going ships, and many  avail themselves of this.  No difficulty isexpected in getting R.N.R.  Officers for a course of  Air training under somewhat similar conditions; in the  future aeroplanes may be expected to come into use to someextent in mail steamers, and Mercantile Marine Officers with a knowledge of Air workwill be of increased value  to their employers, and this possibility may be expected to attract Officers to get their Air training free in the R.N.R.   Generally,  R.N.R.Officers are  keen and  anxious to become efficient as Naval Officers,  and,  even if
aeroplanes do not come into use in the Mercantile Marine, they may be expected to be just as keen to be trained in aircraft work as in other Naval requirements.     R.N.V.R. Officers are also keen and patriotic and very anxious to keep abreastof the latest Naval developments, and it is certain that a few of these Officers will beready to come forward if called upon.     There  will  be  no difficulty  in these circumstances in arranging  that  (say)15 Officers on each list are  trained yearly, which should be sufficient to provide, in emergency, a reserve of about 72 Officers who have completed training within the last3 years.     There would thus  be  available on the outbreak,  or  very  shortly  after theoutbreak, of war the  following Officers who were fully trained and had completedtraining or active employment in the Air less than 3 years before :          Active list  ...      ...       ...       ...    100 serving in second period         Retired or Emergency List   ...       ...     14         R.N.R. and R.N.V.R.       ...       ...     72                                                    186     This would provide an immediate reserve, and in addition there would be under training             Active list ...       ...      ...       ...       ...     90             R.N.R. and R.N.V.R.       .........     30                                                               120     By speeding up training the bulk of these would become available shortly afterthe outbreak of war.  If 50 per cent,  is  considered a sufficient immediate reserveagainst casualties, there will be about  130 available from the above soon after theoutbreak of war towards expansion.     As regards (&amp;), Expansion. Considerable expansion of the Fleet Units is only possible  if additional carriers are available, since the number of  aircraft chieflydepends upon  the stowage capacity of the carriers.     Expansion  in the number of  carriers could be effected by the conversion ofmerchant vessels, but  this would take a considerable time, and during this time itwould be possible to train the personnel.     To provide the bulk of  the personnel required for war-time expansion it will therefore be safe to rely on an increase of the numbers of regular Officers and mentrained on or after the outbreak of war,  together with a temporary expansion of theR.N.R. and R.N.V.R., both to supplement the Air Arm and to replace in the Fleetthe Naval personnel required for Air work.     As has been shown, about 130 Officers will be available shortly after the outbreakof war.     Additional trained  personnel  would  also be  available from the Retired and emergency Lists and from the R.N.R. and R.N.V.R. Lists,, since although, for theimmediate reserve, it is proposed to take only Officers who have completed training or their first period of Air employment less than 3 years before the outbreak of war, themajority of  Officers who completed such training or service less than 6 years beforewould, after a refresher  course, be suitable.     These would approximately amount to : Retired and Emergency Lists (Regular Officers) ...    14R.N.R. and R.N.V.R.&apos;       ...       ......    72                                                   86    Of which, say, 75 per cent, are available   ... = 64    Add 130  already available        ...       ...   130             Total for expansion-     ...       ...   194 Officers.    Reserves Ratings. There will be no difficulty in building up  a resertechnical ratings as part of the Royal Fleet Reserve.    If necessary, the reserve could be increased by including technical ratings iR.N.R. and R.N.V.R.
APPENDIX  (F).                        FLEET AIR ARM (MATERIAL).                       Provision of Aircraft Reserves.    It has been suggested that there is an advantage  in a common pool of reservematerial which can be drawn on both by the Navy and  Air Force.    This is not considered to be the case, as, apart from the differences in type whichmay be expected to  increase with specialised development, it is  obvious  that  theRoyal Air  Force must expand enormously and rapidly  on the outbreak of war withany Power within Air range of England, and  therefore,  undue economy in  theprovision of  reserves in  peace time  would  result in the whole of the pool beingabsorbed by the Air Force in the first few weeks of war.    2. Experience shows that as a general rule reserves accumulated  in peace time are seldom  sufficient to meet the demands of war, and therefore, it is highly probablethat the common pool would prove inadequate.    The Navy therefore proposes   to create and  maintain its  own reserve of aeroplanes  and engines.    3. In  the event of a purely land or  air war  in which the  Navy could not participate, it would always be possible to allocate Naval reserves  to the Air Forcein emergency.APPENDIX  (G).     RELATIVE COST OF FLEET UNITS UNDER ADMIRALTY AND AIR MINISTRY.                           1. PERSONNEL.                           2. MATERIAL.                           3. ADMINISTRATION.                                1.  Personnel.    The relative cost of personnel for the Fleet Units under the Navy or Air force will depend on two things :  (a) numbers;  (b) difference of pay and length of service.    As regards (a), numbers.  The Navy expect to be able to effect a saving  in numbers by the combination of Air and Ship duties on board the Carrier, whichwill result in a reduction in the total cost of wages to the Carrier.    As regards the  personnel employed at the aerodromes, no great  saving in thenumber of men employed can be looked for, and the wages bill would be about thesame under either Service.    Headquarters, store and repair depots are dealt with separately.j    (b).  Differences  in  pay and length of service.  &apos; The Air Force  is at  presentdependent to a great extent on short-service personnel, and if under the  presentsystem it is greatly increased in the future, it must become more and more dependentpn short-service personnel.I    It is difficult to compare the  actual cost of a short-service system with a long-service system such as the Navy, but the following arguments will show  that whatever their relative cost may be at different times, the cost of the short-service system  islikely to increase, whilst, owing to the reduction in cost of living, the long-servicesystem is likely to decrease in cost.j    Even when, as  at the present time, employment in  civil life  is scarce, there  ish difficulty in obtaining  candidates  for  short  service,  and consequently, whenPpportunities in civil life  are abundant, it is  certain that candidates for shortlervice will be few and  not of the best.  In that case, it will be necessary  to makeIhort service more attractive by shortening the period, raising pay, and increasingthe amount of the gratuities at its termination.I    The present  time seems to be particularly well suited economically  for  theAdmiralty Scheme.   The Navy has been greatly cut down, and there is at the momentI surplus of suitable personnel whom it will be costly to  discharge.I   On the other hand,  the present time appears to be ill-suited  economically for aprge increase of short-service R.A.F.  personnel on the existing system.I    &apos; I.1018G]                                                          u
    A recovery in trade and employment in civil life is eventually looked for, andwith it must come increasing scarcity of candidates,  with consequent increase of cost in obtaining them.    Any saving of R.A.F. personnel which can be effected by replacement with naval personnel must, therefore, be  conomical to the country as a whole.                                 2. Material. &apos;    The quantity of material required under  either Service must  remain about thsame.  The actual cost of materials ordered may also  be  assumed to be  about thesame.  The total cost will, however, be effected by the cost of the personnel requiredto administer supply.   This is dealt with under  administration.Cost of Repairs.    Figures of comparative cost are not available.    The Naval Establishments, as also the Naval Engineering personnel, have greatexperience of all repair processes, and of these the Air Ministry, within its short lifecan have little by comparison.    It is probable that less &apos;&apos; scrapping &apos;&apos; would be done  by the  Admiralty--withattendant economy.    The machinery  for  repairs  is  available  in  the  Dockyards,  and  no extra expenditure would be required, while the  ability  of these establishments to  undertakmanufacture  of  spare  parts will be  reflected  in  reduced  prices quoted  bcontractors.                              3. Administration.    This falls&apos;under two heads:  (a) administration of Units; (&amp;)  administrationof Supply.(a.) A dministration of Units.    Under  the present system, the first administrative body is the  Air ministry the transfer  of  administration  from  the Air  Ministry to  the Admiralty  shouldinvolve no extra cost.    The Admiralty Departments which deal with pay, victualling  and personnelcould all carry out their duties as regards the Fleet Units without further increase.    In addition  to the Air Ministry, there are at  present the following  concernedin administering  the Fleet Units :          (a.) Area Headquarters  in London.         (b.) No.  10 Group Headquarters, Leuchars.         (c.) No.  29 Group Headquarters, Lee-on-Solent.         \d.) A.O.C. Mediterranean, Malta.    Under  the Admiralty scheme the work of these four Headquarters would be divided amongst:          (1.) The Commanders^in-Chief.         (2.) One Commodore (A).         (3.) The Commanding Officers of Stations.    Of these (1) and (3) exist at present;  (2)  would deal with organisation, &amp;c-,would recommend to the Admiralty for appointments, promotions, &amp;c, and would, infact, correspond closely to R.A. (S) in the submarine branch.    Under the Admiralty scheme, therefore, whilst four administrative Units wouldbe done away with, only one Commodore  (A) would be added.(b.) Administration of Supply.    As shown in N.D. (R), 9, the machinery dealing with research and design willbe  practically  the  existing R.A.F. machinery,  with the addition of  a  few naval officers.  This will at first involve a small increase in cost;     It is improbable  that the Air Ministry can  effect reductions on account of theseadditions,  but it is probable than an increase in the independent Air Force couldbe effected with less increase in the Research and Design Departments than would 1*necessary if the  Fleet Units remained R.A.F.   Further,  the Admiralty maintain that the introduction of  technical Naval personnel into this Department will leadto increased efficiency which in the long run is economical.

    Note.-In the above estimate the total personnel employed in the purely adminis-trative Headquarters have been added together.  No. 29 Group has not been included as this Headquarters includes the Aerodrome Command.   The AdministrativePersonnel at Fort Blockhouse has been taken as being what would be employed onadministering the  Fleet  Units under Admiralty proposals,  as the organisationproposed for the  Fleet Units is on the lines of that of the submarine branch.    Naval rates  of pay have been calculated and no flying allowance has been included.  As most of the R.A.F. Officers are of the flying branch the saving should in fact be greater.

SUMMARY.    It will be seen from the foregoing that a saving of  45,366 is estimated from sources which can be calculated, which may be increased to  78,441 when the numberof large Fleet Carriers is increased to five.    In addition to this calculated saving there is a further very considerable savingwhich cannot be calculated, under the following heads :     1. Difference in pay and Service (already mentioned).    2. Cost of repairs (already mentioned).    3. Cost  of  transport of stores  and equipment and personnel, due  to  Naval          transport system being fully utilised.    4. Cost of storage, particularly at Fleet bases abroad, due to full use being made          of existing Dockyard store accommodation.    5. Cost of  new buildings for accommodation of personnel due to employment of          existing Naval Barracks and Depots, particularly at Fleet bases abroad.    6. Further reduction of personnel in Fleet Carriers  due to the amalgamation          of all semi-skilled and unskilled ratings in the ship.    7. Cost of the original construction of Carriers,  due to the amalgamation of          workshops,  repair machinery and store rooms,  io

The &quot;great principle of Admiralty&quot; which  the  Naval Staff declare toat issue may be fairly and succinctly stated by a quotation from an Admiralty papwhich was issued earlier in the present  controversy :                          1         &quot;Firstly it must be emphasised that such air forces are part and parcel!    the fighting  fleet and perform a definite  function just as much as battleshiJ    light cruisers and submarines.  Without them the fleet is not ready for actid    Such air  forces cannot.be withdrawn from  the  fleet for work with the InJ    pendent Air Service without destroying the efficiency  of the Fleet.  Withdraw!    in war time could only be ordered by the Government of  the day  and woif    correspond to the paying off of battleships and the utilisation of the crews ff    work with the Army ashore.  In other words, the air forces of the fighting flef    are Naval units forming part of the whole naval fighting forces and require!    be considered separately from the air forces of the Independent Air Service!    2. It is stated even more briefly  in  the Admiralty&apos;s latest  paper  as :Admiralty should be solely responsible  for the efficiency of the Fleet.&quot;   .. The Air Staff cannot find in any part of the First Sea Lord&apos;s. evidence or in tlof the other Admiralty witnesses, any  recognition of the  fact that the efficiencythe Fleet cannot be properly regarded as an end itself, or that it should be consider!in relation  to the greater principle of the country&apos;s defence interests as a whollIf it can be shown, as the Air Staff contend has been done, that to  redivide theService  would be prejudicial to a vital defence interest,  namely,  that of  safetythe air,  and if it  is also the case that the efficiency of the Fleet in no way  suffersis indeed promoted by the present method of providing Naval Air  units, then thelis no  reason for  going back  upon the present system in order to satisfy a demaibased on an arbitrary principle which has no bearing upon the real issues  involvedthis controversy.   The Air Staff  feel that any concession to the Admiralty of &quot;responsibility &quot; as regards air units working with the Fleet should equally be ap.pl:to the War Office as regards the organisation of air units for the Army.   In vie&apos;of the recent decision as to  provision of these latter units they urge that it woullbe anomalous  that a decision in the opposite sense should be given in the matter (\air units working with the  Navy.    3. As a corollary to  their main contention, the Air Staff are absolutely convinctl(1) that if the principle of a separate Naval air service  is admitted,  no  partiJseverance is practicable, and the Naval air service must be completely independeiin all respects.  (2) That whatever hopes in organisation may now be held out by tl:Admiralty the final and  near result of setting up  a second air service will be largelincreased expenditure in proportion to the return obtained  from it.   This1 aspeiof the case  is dealt with in Part IV of the present paper.    4. The Naval Staff seek to establish their claim to a separate and independent aijservice manned, equipped, controlled and  administered by the Admiralty, partly 1alleging administrative  defects and failures  of the present system (see Appendixof this paper) and partly by urging that, apart from such defects,  a separate Navsair service is a  necessary and inseparable element in the naval  organisation fa.guaranteeing the security of  our sea communications.    The objections to the re-establishment of a separate naval air service, orthe Admiralty prefer to call it, a naval air arm,  were in  point of fact fully set onless-than a year ago.  It may be convenient briefly here to restate them :      (a.) The work of naval air units (whether provided by the Admiralty or the AiMinistry)  is inherently different in nature from that of Naval  units properly 9called.   Surface or submarine craft operate  in a two-dimensional element; aircraioperate in another element, which is one of three dimensions.  Moreover, if the actua.duties carried out by the Air units co-operating with the Navy are examined in detaifrom their various aspects, it is clear that air experience and training are prior flimportance to naval qualifications.  In short, Naval air units are primarily air units and  not  sea  units, whether regarded from the point  of  view  of operations oiequipment.                 ;                                              -   ,     (&amp;.) The  Chief of the Air Staff in his evidence argued that one reason  tor tnmaintenance of a unified air service was that to set up a subsidiary naval air serviwould militate against the effective organisation  of our air power  as a whole.Naval Staff fastened upon this as disclosing an intention to develop the Fleet air ar with a view to the air defence of the  British Islands instead of for duty witn w
 leet, and claim it as demonstrating the &quot; vital necessity of removing from the Airg / f) Ministry every vestige of control of the fleet air arm.&quot;   (c.) The attitude of the Naval Staff on this point indicates clearly what can only ^described as a fundamental lack of understanding of the real issues in this con-[(wversy.  The Naval Staff refuse to recognise that the extension of warfare to  the jr has introduced a new and permanent complication  in  the problem of national fefence, or to realise that, as the air overlies both sea and land, so the need for aerial lipremacy will be as vital to the security of this country as sea supremacy has been a the past.                                .        &apos;   &apos;                    .   If  at some future date the British Empire is compelled to fight in the air for its sistence as in the past it has been compelled to fight on land and sea, it is vital that ,.,r air forces should be  reared on a single policy, trained on a single system, and imbued with a single doctrine not only at Home, but throughout the Dominions.   The Air can be approached from one angle only; any attempt to utilise  it from lira totally different angles will handicap its employment to  a disastrous  extent.Moreover,  it is impossible to define the dividing line between the Air  arm of the fleet and the remainder of the air arm.  Between the air on the one hand and land  and sea m the other there is no high-water mark.  Definition of the  dividing line will always efy the attempts of either the Naval or Air Staffs.   (d.) The Air Staff feel that the case for maintaining a single unified air service  enforced by  the recent Memorandum of  the  First Lord of  the Admiralty on &quot;The Relation of the Three  Services&quot; (N.D. 5).   He  refers, for .example,  to  thepossibility of a future war might involve the seizure by the Navy of island bases offthe coasts  of Italy or Turkey or Japan with the object of conducting  from therepurely  aerial operations  against enemy coasts and vital centres.  Is it not  obviousthat  in such a situation  it  would be our aim to  apply the maximum available  air strength at the decisive point,  and to throw in not only air units primarily allotted to(he Fleet, but also Independent air units and units normally working with the Army ?      v .  :,.Decent experience in the  Levant has shown land-working squadrons can be conveyed;y aircraft carrier and flown off the deck.  But it is equally obvious that the conductif air operations on a large scale of the kind suggested by Mr. Amery would be  far asier if the units concerned are based on a single system of air training and strategy.   (e.) In order to support their contention that the operations of Fleet Air Units  N.D.  (E) 17,   he  segregated from other  forms  of air operations, the  Naval Staff now  seek to  A^e&quot;^c1&apos;6 reduce to a minimum the  possibilities of intervention by shore-based aircraft in naval  paragrap   4 jperations.  The locality of naval battles and naval operations will normally  at least :be almost certainly far  removed from &quot;British shore-going aircraft and considerably sitside their range of action.&quot;  This opinion is  in unexplained contrast with  the dews expressed by the Naval Staff  less than a year  ago.*  The Naval  Staff then  O.I.D. 357-B.. ffirmed that the co-operation  of air forces (other  than those belonging to a Fleet air irm), large or small, as circumstances might demand, would be essential in a secondary sphere of naval operations, such as the protection of commerce in confined waters,  the &quot;iefence of important bases and in  attacks on  enemy bases.   They went further and stated that &quot; if a big sea battle is considered  imminent  it  may be vital, in order to ithieve  the annihilation of the enemy,  to concentrate  independent  air  forces to it-operate in the naval battle.&quot;   (/.) Even  now  the  Naval Staff  are constrained to  recognise that shore-based  N.D.  (K)i7,. literaft may be required  for  clearly defined functions,  such as attacks on  enemy  Appendix aircraft over the sea, torpedo attacks  on enemy ships, - bombing attacks on  enemy  grapbi5-&apos; &apos;ips, but  seek to avoid the  dilemma  by suggesting  that  these operations  by  theindependent air arm can be carried out independently of the working of the Fleet ir arm.  *The Naval. Staff are prone to violent and unexplained reversals of view.  In 1919 they stronglyapported the maintenance of the Air Force (CP. 6478).  By February 1922 they were convinced ofit necessity for its abolition (C.I.D. 160C).  By July 1922 they had changed their minds again and*lared that to abolish  the Air Ministry or  to  destroy the Royal Air Force would be a  stepJ.D. 357B) &quot; retrograde and detrimental to their own as well as to the national interests.&quot;  Similarttradictions appear in the view of the Admiralty upon, the supply of aircraft material.  In JanuaryMO they claimed that &quot; the fighting departments must be left to purchase their own technical stores,&quot;pi that &quot; any system under which bulk storage is  maintained by another Department can  only lead1*inconvenience and possibly disaster.&quot;   (CP. 616.)  But  in July  1922 (C.I.D. 357B) they wereSpared to leave the supply of aircraft for the Naval Air Arm to the  Air Ministry.  This latter viewfjs also definitely  taken by Lord Beatty in his evidence before the Sub-Committee on  the 22ndI Mi, 1923.   (See Qq. 45-55.)   In N.D.  (E) 9 issued only a few weeks later the Naval Staff haveItemed  another volte-face, and insisted that  the Admiralty must have absolute control over the SDN and supply of its own air&quot; equipment.
   * A detailed examination of the defects alleged by the Admiralty witnesses and in theNaval Staff papers is attached to the Paper (see Appendices I-II).               (g.)  The First Sea Lord interpreted the evidence of the Chief of the Air Sta           to mean that all Naval engagements of the future would be fought within ranee           aircraft based on British territory.               The Chief of the Air Staff actually stated that all Naval battles and the majorit           of naval operations will be carried out in the vicinity or within reach of shore-coil           aircraft.   This opinion is adhered to.  It is reasonable to reckon that in any main           war of the future we should  not be  without allies, and that we should be able I           establish  air bases, if necessary, on their territory.               It is unlikely that diplomacy will fail us to the extent of depriving  us of           Allies.               (k.)  The Naval  Staff again minimise the fact that the Fleet Air  arm could           be maintained without a considerable number of shore establishments, by referrii PartPpwI&apos;  %h% to aerodromes &quot;not necessarily of a permanent type,&quot; which could, it graph b.     suggested, be used simultaneously by aircraft of the Royal Air Force and those&apos;of tl           Naval Air Service.  Such an arrangement will create far more room for friction tha           anything in the present  system.               Picture the administrative and operational confusion and duplication of repai           facilities, &amp;c, which would be bound to result from two separate Air Services usr           one  aerodrome at permanent oversea bases such as Malta and Singapore, where, i           addition to their  independent role, aircraft  may be required to co-operate  with tl           Army as well as with the Navy.  At the numerous temporary bases, which  wi           inevitably be brought into being in any future major war, confusion would be wors           confounded and endless difficulties would result from allied  air forces having to de           with two distinct air services with different systems of administration at one  an           the same station.N.D.(R) 17,       5,  The  answer of the Air Ministry to the  &quot;great principle&quot;  on which tPa&quot; L       Admiralty base their claim is, in brief,  that in view of  the  development, actua           and prospective, of air power, of its bearing on our insular security, and of tl           likelihood that  any future war of magnitude,  whether naval,  military or purel           aerial, will be marked by concentrated air operations, the unity of our air organisatio           is as necessary as the unity of the Navy  or of the Army.  Through the time&apos;,           institution of a  single air service under the stress of war we have gained a lead ove           other countries.   It  is essential that we should, not blindly  throw away this lea           and sacrifice the national interests  to  narrow departmental prejudice.   Tli           maintenance of one great air  service is the only sure foundation on  which can&apos;           built up  the  air power  of   the  British  Empire which  is  already  as vita           to our existence as the sea power won for us by the prescience of our Elizabetha           forefathers and which has a future of unmeasured potentialities.               6.  It is not necessary for the Air Ministry to prove  that the provision of i           separate air service for the Navy (and for the Army too) would have no advantage           or conveniences which the present system does not offer; nor is the question susceptibl           of settlement by appeals to pure logic from either side.  Their contention is  that if           broad and long  view is taken of the problems of national and imperial defence as,           whole, it  is  clearly in the interests of the  country  (including  those  of the NaT           itself) that a single  air  service should be  responsible for providing air units bot           for  independent air operations and for  air work ancillary to that  of naval  an           military  forces.  The Air Ministry  submit that their  views are in this respec           confirmed by the fact that the Admiralty, apart from their challenge to the preseii           system on grounds of theory, have failed  to produce evidence  of any defects* i           application  which could not be removed if that system was  accepted as final by bot           departments, subject to such administrative modifications as  the Air Ministry ha&quot;           declared their willingness to introduce.  The Air Ministry&apos;s proposals in that regarc           have already been set out in paragraph 8 of N.D. (R) 12.
                               PART II.Note on Admiralty Objections to Air Ministry&apos;s Proposals for Secondment of     N.D.(R) 17,                        Naval Officers to R.A.F.                              PnrlinL      7.  The Admiralty&apos;s objections to  the proposals  for  the  secondment of  naval   officers  for air duties are in fact that they do not amount to the same thing as setting   up a separate naval air service.  It was, of course, not intended that they should,   jut the Admiralty evade the point that a large element of secondment as proposed by   he Air Ministry, while avoiding the disadvantages of setting up two separate air   services, would meet all the objections which the Admiralty have brought against the   efficiency of the present system except the question of  Admiralty responsibility.      All the objections raised in their paper (Part 3, paragraph 3) are based on this   question of responsibility, which is given a formidable appearance by  division into   six sub-headings.  It  is really a question merely  of responsibility  and not  of   efficiency.                                          ;               ,      8.  It has not been contended by the Admiralty in any of the evidence  placed   before the Committee that, if the system of seconding were put into force, it would   not ensure the  production  of a body of Naval officers  with air experience and   competent to judge the true value which should be attached to the Air Arm of thera  Fleet.      9.  A separate Naval air service,  on the other hand, has already by practical   experience been  proved to create  antagonism and rivalry  in  aerial organisation.   Secondment would, moreover, preserve the principle that the conditions of service in   connection with  flying  should be the same for all officers and airmen, whereas dual   organisation would inevitably create anomalies between the conditions of employment,   which would be a further source of much friction.      10. As regards appointment of seconded  officers  to carriers, the Air Ministry  N.D. (B) 17,   would  have no  objection to  Admiralty  concurrence  in  such  appointments  being  paragraph 2,   obtained or to consulting the Admiralty on all questions touching the flying career of  sub-para-   those officers.                 -                                      ,             f^f       11. The Admiralty&apos;s criticism of the present system includes a reference  to the   certainty of its &quot;failure in war.&quot;  The answer to  this is that the system of provision   of air  units for the Navy by. the R.A.F. successfully stood  the  test of war for   &quot; months in  1918,  and that the then First Sea Lord, writing  in January 1919  M.8618.ta  at a time when the lessons of war were fresher in the minds of the Naval Staff, fully   accepted the present system  as providing a higher standard of airmanship than a   purely naval air service could attain.      12. The  Admiralty adduce seven  reasons  why  &quot;seconding  is  unsound  in  \.D. (B) 17,1a:application.&quot;  These may be considered in their orderPart III,paragraph 4,      (a.) The Air Ministry emphatically do not accept the statement that any serious ^important&quot;   attempt has  been  made  to carry  out the principle  of  secondment.   It was first M-O)..   specifically suggested by  the Admiralty itself in 1919, but by July 1920, when the  j Heet  Order inviting applications  was issued,  it was common knowledge that thel0t admiralty were pressing to regain a separate naval air service.  All officers fearedan( that it would be a case of &quot; out of sight, out of mind &quot; if they left the  main line of^ec laval service where there would be no senior naval officers to support their retention.f0.    The Admiralty claim that the two Fleet Orders,  one  for officers to be seconded  ; P ^ne ftoyal Air Force and the other for aircraft observers, are similarly worded.30 this is not the  case.  The order calling for observers  definitely states that observers   fill form  one of the specialist branches  in  the Royal Navy, which are notoriously!a1&apos; post  sought  for and which form  the best  avenue  for promotion.  There was  no   ^responding statement  as regards  officers applying for secondment  or  anv other   ^assurances  which would counteract the widely diffused, belief that the Board of    dmiralty were opposed to the existence of the naval branches of the Royal Air Force.      (6.) With any sign of encouragement from the Board of Admiralty the need for   jompulsion would not arise.  At the same time it is  difficult to see why &quot;compulsion   bould be out of the question.&apos;&apos;      There is, in fact, no  reason  whatever why the terms  of entry for  future    ndidates for admission  to Dartmouth should not explicitly state that Naval Officersiribi[ay be required by the Board of Admiralty to be seconded for specified periods to the    oval Air Force for service  with the Navy.  Lack of  precedent is  obviously  no    ]ection,  for dependence on precedent  means stagnation.   Air warfare  had  no
N.D. (E) 17,Part III,paragraph 5.precedent 20 years ago.  Indeed, the Air Ministry are of opinion that the introcijtion of compulsory secondment as between  all three fighting services would be]signal step of progress towards the evolution of a common defence doctrine.  AMand every step for promoting the further interchange of personnel between the NamArmy and Air Force  cannot but benefit all three services,  and, what is more, tiincreasing the  efficiency of our  defence organisation as a  whole,  make  alike foieconomy and greater security.     (c) and (d).   The Air Ministry do not admit the correctness of these contentionsSecondment has,  indeed, in the past provided an outlet for  the  abler officers of tifighting services,  of which they have been eager to avail themselves.   Service with]Foreign Power or attachment  to the  Staff College of another service have actual!proved an avenue of promotion.  Many distinguished names could  be cited in tliiconnection; and it is certain that there has been no &quot; feeling of insecurity.&quot;   In tlipresent case, however,  the proposal is not for a few isolated secondments,  but for iconsiderable body of seconded officers working as regards the most important part otheir duties under the  eyes of senior  officers of their parent  service.   Indeedimmediately below the Admiralty stress this fact to the point of exaggeration, aitargue that it  makes  the secondment  scheme  &quot;incongruous.&quot;  Moreover,  theiimmediate superiors will in many cases  be also naval officers seconded, for a  secor.period, and a senior naval,officer will be in command of every carrier.  As regardpromotion,  the Admiralty have the  remedy in their  own  hands by making tliisecondment rank  as a specialist branch, and by treating officers seconded for air wor!on an equality with other specialists.     (e.)  This is an argument in favour of the  Air Ministry scheme as  against tlAdmiralty&apos;s  proposals.    There  will  obviously be  a smaller increase  in tlLieutenants&apos; List if secondment is adopted than if a separate  Naval Air Arm iformed, since in  the former  event  only 30 per cent,  of  the personnel of Royal Ai]Force units with  the Fleet will be regular naval  officers, as against 100 per cent, ilthe Naval Air Arm.   The block in promotion will  be  the more serious under ttJAdmiralty&apos;s scheme inasmuch as it apparently contemplates running the Naval AiArm without any increase  in existing senior commands.  This, fact is discussed morjfully in paragraph 20  below.  The  Air Ministry&apos;s proposals,  on the other hand, witprovide an outlet  partly by re-secondments and also by occasional permanent transfer,(subject  to  Admiralty consent) of officers  of medium  seniority who show speciaaptitude for air work.     (/.)  The Commander-in-Chief would be in the same position if  a newly arrive!pilot were a naval officer.or ex-naval officer whom he had not met before.     (g.) Lastly,  the Admiralty claim that it is incongruous to  second an officer tilanother service when during the greater part of his time he will be employed back oihis own service on a man-of-war.     The answer  to this is that the officer seconded for Air work will not servegreat part of his time  on board, or that if he does he will be short of flying practice!It is not according to facts that the naval air service if created would consist of ailpersonnel working in ships, and expansion to shore bases of all natures and types islinevitable.     13. The Air Ministry have thought it necessary to deal at some length with thelobjections adduced by the Admiralty^ these secondment proposals, which,  in theirlview, offer the best solution to the problem of naval air provision.   As stated above!they are satisfied that the policy of secondment has never yet been given a fair trial!by the Admiralty. So long as the Admiralty regard the system of provision of navallair units by the  Royal  Air Force as an evil to be cured as soon as possible, it islperhaps not unnatural that their action should be to refrain from heartily sup porting jany measures which, if brought to fruition, would deprive them of their most useful Iarguments for restoring a separate naval  air service.                       -nil     The Air Staff are convinced that there would be  no lack of-volunteers if  theAdmiralty issued an order  making it  clear that, subject to qualifications as an efficient pilot and in the event of being well reported upon, service with the Air force would definitelv be reckoned towards promotion.                       .        .     It is possible that, following the course already adopted by the Admiralty in thematter of observers, it may be necessary to offer additional inducement in the form ojextra pay.  When the question of pay is readjusted for all three services in 1924 itwould be  quite feasible to differentiate somewhat more between the pay  of junior officers in the Royal Air Force and that of junior officers in the other services.
                           PART  III.Remarks by the Air Staff on the Admiralty&apos;s own Proposals for the        N.B.(R) 17,              Organisation of a Naval Air Service.                       Partly.     17. The Admiralty preface their review of their proposals by postulating, as a  lecessary consideration, that the Admiralty must have &quot; full control &quot; of the FleetBur arm.  It should be hardly necessary at  this stage of this lengthy controversy to  lomt out that the phrase &quot; full control &quot; can be used in two very different meanings.  .1 the suggestion is that full operational and disciplinary control by the Navy over  ur units working with the Fleet is dependent upon the adoption of the Admiralty&apos;s  wn proposals,  this is  emphatically denied by the Air Staff.  It has been fully   The Air Staff  desire to refer,  as  evidence of their belief  that  the  policy ofecondment  has never yet been fully backed by the  Admiralty, to  the procedure&quot;adopted by the Admiralty in other analogous cases.   A.M.O. 2/1914, inviting applications from officers to join for service with the .N.A.S., expressly stated-   &quot;that service of Naval officers in  the.R.N.A.S.  will count in  all respects as   service  in ships of war  at sea.&quot;   Further that    &quot;officers found to be unfitted for the duties of the R.N.A.S. might be required   to revert to ordinary duties, but that this would not necessarily indicate that any   blame was attributed to them.&quot;   Fleet Order  289/1921  inviting applications from Lieutenants  for training as  jrvers for Naval aircraft contained the following paragraph :-       &quot; Commanding officers are instructed to bring  this to the notice of all eligible   officers, and are particularly desired to point out that the Admiralty attach great   importance to  this training.   It is considered that the development of future   gunnery depends to a large extent on efficient  observation from the air.&quot;&quot;he same order  provided  for extra remuneration for these officers while underraining.                                               ^   14. Special  measures have  been adopted by  the Admiralty to attract  naval ratings for specialist services.   Thus A.M.O. 3845/1917, in calling for volunteers for he submarine service, provided for a notice to be    &quot;displayed conspicuously  on the Ship&apos;s Company Notice Boards of all  H.M.   Ships and establishments.&quot;The same procedure was followed with A.M.O. 3160/1918.   15. Fleet Order  1156/1920  (again dealing with  the submarine  service)  clearly stated-   &quot;that the submarine service offers  exceptional opportunities to  intelligent men.       &quot; The  percentage  of  higher ratings  required,  both substantive and non-   substantive,  is very high,  and classes for  higher  ratings are being formed   continuously.&quot;    16. In these  circumstances  they  feel  that  the  First Sea Lord is under  a  N.D. (R), m.misapprehension in stating that  it would  not be in accordance with Admiralty          s.practice to  do more than issue.a  bare announcement.   A comparison of the terms ofthe order in Appendix (A) of N.D. (R) 17 with the terms of  the orders quoted aboveappears to  the Air Staff in every way to support the views expressed  by the DeputyUhief of the Air Sta.ff, and they are at a loss to understand the resentment whichthe First Sea Lord has expressed in regard to the Air Ministry&apos;s criticisms of theA.dmiralty&apos;s action.   The final  remark, of the Air Ministry is  that a  ready  acceptance by all three services of the principle of mutual secondment is  indispensable to any real co-opera-iion between the services, and,  above all, to that unity  of higher direction in meetinglie problems of national and imperial defence.
          established in evidence that the existing arrangements already secure such control          though  the  Air  Ministry are,  as  already  indicated,  ready  to  consider  am          administrative adjustments which would facilitate its  working.  The  Admiralty          however, in the present context are using the phrase&quot; full control &quot; as implying an          inherent right on the part of the Navy to form a new  and completely self-contains          air service.              As  regards the Admiralty&apos;s specific proposals for carrying out these  objects, thi          Air Ministry have the following broad observations to make :           Provision of Personnel.              18. (a.)  The Admiralty propose that the Naval Officer pilots,of the Naval aii          arm should consist entirely of  Lieutenants  and Officers above the rank.  A naval          Lieutenant corresponds to an Army Captain or an E.A.F. Flight.Lieutenant.   Thf          is not an economical proposition as the officers will be by air standards over-graded foi          their duties.              (b.)  It is far easier for a unified Air Service to provide for the expansion of on&apos;          part of  it, i.e., the fleet aircraft units, than it will be  for the Admiralty to proyid          for expansion on the basis of a specialist branch of the Navy.  The regular naval          personnel brought back to flying duties would be mostly over thirty years of age an&apos;          out of practice, in an aspect of flying which calls for a high degree of skill, and whic          is  more than most kinds, a young man&apos;s business.  The position in this respect ol          R.A.F. Officers on administrative duties at Headquarter Units is not analogous, as          they are kept in  regular flying practice, which could  not be the case with officers          serving afloat in ordinary ships  of war.              (c.) The Admiralty ignore the provision of aircraft mechanics.   They  haw          previously stated that, except for a few higher standard mechanics, existing nava          ratings are competent to do the work.  This is not in accordance with experience, a&apos;          it  is common knowledge that when the Admiralty had their own Naval Air Servic          it  was found absolutely necessary to make new types of ratings in large quantities          for this work.              (d.) It is difficult to believe how  an organisation in which 100 per cent, of the          officer personnel are regular Naval personnel will not create a greater &quot; block in          promotion&quot;  than an organisation in which only 30  per  cent,  are regular Naval          personnel, even when full allowance  is made for the additional number of senior          appointments which would be created. The number of these appointments  would beN.D. (a) 17,  apparently small if the Admiralty  proposals to substitute 1 Commodore  (A) for theAPPENDIX    existing Coastal Area Headquarters, No. 10 and 29 Group Headquarters and MaltaWrt in.    Headquarters were carried out.  It is, however, difficult to reconcile their proposed          policy  with the estimates in  Appendix  (D),  which  provides for  2 Flag Officers,          11 Captains and 45 Commanders for Naval air appointments.  It is true that the full          number was only to be attained when the Naval air arm reached a total of 350 officers,          but the  actual ratio of senior appointments would,  on the figures of Appendix (D),          be considerably higher  instead of lower  than in the present  organisation  of naval          air units maintained by the R.A.F.  In other words, if the organisation of the Fleet          air arm was on the  lines proposed in Appendix (G) there would be no  room in it          for the number of  senior appointments  proposed in  Appendix (D), even if the          latter are to be read as including the senior officers in command of aircraft carriers.             - Possibly, as the proportion  of senior officers to men is far higher in the Navy  than          it  is in  the Royal Air Force, the Admiralty may have retained more senior officers          than are necessary for the Navy in its present reduced form with a view  to their          subsequent employment in their Naval air arm.          Research, Design and Supply of Materials..N.D. (E)9.       19, The Admiralty  propose that  a joint research and design committee          should be set up on which the Admiralty should be fully represented; that subsequent          responsibility  for passing of specifications and for supply should, rest  with the          Admiralty.  This loosely-worded proposal burkes the actual administrative issues          involved, nor is the obscurity removed by the fuller statement contained in the separate          memorandum, on design and supply circulated by the Naval staff as N.D. (R) 9.              (b.)  It is clear that a Joint Committee must be either executive or advisory,  li          it is executive, the  executive authority must  be vested in  one  of the  three service          departments and the other service departments must accept its decisions.  If it is
 Sfisory, the service departments concerned must, if the instrument  on which  itDBrjses is a vital one, maintain their own scientific and technical staff to enable themJMecide whether they should accept the advice or not.                           &apos;IB (c\) Such bodies as the Chemical Warfare Eesearch Committee and the JointIpinaiice Committee (which are referred to by the Admiralty as analogous) are all?Mrisory Committees.   The arrangements proposed by the Admiralty  would be in Sect another advisory committee, whose internal administration might be run by the jlir Ministry and which would advise the Navy as to research and  design.  If the admiralty representatives  dissented from its  conclusions,  it  is  clear  that  the Hdniiralty would claim the right for the protection of their own personnel to follow Heir own representatives&apos;  views.  The Admiralty&apos;s proposals, therefore, necessarily- Bjply the  setting up in the Admiralty of a  similar criticising body, such as the directorate of  Eesearch in the  Air Ministry  and  a Joint Committee, howevernjLful, could not avert the need for maintaining  dual staffs on research and design^Jtork.  The anomalous position would thus be created of a Government department finch was  originally set up  for the development  of  aircraft having  a precise Lnterpart of  itself set up within the  ambit of another department.e I  (d.) It  is impossible for anyone who is familiar with the intensely autonomousI pirit of the Admiralty, as illustrated both by past experience and in the  present con-j roversy, to  believe that  they would long stop short of full research facilities under  heir own control. The Admiralty were invited by the Air Board in 1916 to accept aj! oint system of experiment and research.   They replied that &quot; it is indispensable that  lie Admiralty should be free to carry out all experiments and researches required in,  oimection with the  work in the Naval Air  Service without reference to  any other3  Department.&quot;    (e.) The Admiralty&apos;s statement that &quot;they have  no control over the  design of  N.D.(B)I7, aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm &quot; is a half-truth which again illustrates their inability  ^rth&quot;*P^ra&quot; o overcome a purely departmental outlook.  The  Admiralty are kept fully in touch rith the progress of design and  its  bearing upon their requirements  in terms of lerformance, as  formulated by the Naval Staff.   But by &apos;&apos; control over design &quot; he Admiralty  clearly have in mind an independent staff  with the last word in [questions of pure design,  which  can only  be secured by duplicating  the  present echnical organisation existing in the Air Ministry. leserves of Personnel and Material.   20. See Appendices III and IV.    21. The Admiralty  refer to the proposals that initial training in air  work and abstain forms of specialised training could still be carried out by the Air  Ministry, md quote the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff as having  admitted that this would offer io difficulties.  The Admiralty&apos;s reference to this point is due to a misunderstanding &apos;f his evidence.   22. The evidence referred to deals with the possibility of training young naval  N,D.

The assumption made by the  Admiralty that  the quantity of materlrequired under either Service will remain the same is unlikely to be realised.    Under the scheme outlined by the Admiralty in N.D. (R) 9 the Naval Air Aiwill hold complete  stocks of  all aircraft material,  including reserves,  and a[suggestion of a common pool is negatived.    It is  a  well-known fact that, if common stores are kept in two  depots insttjof one, duplication of  supply  results.  This inevitably leads to  extra provision ajextra cost.Repairs.    28.

It ignores the complete difference in material and technique  betwathe construction of aircraft and ships.   It might equally well be contended  tilmotor cars should be repaired by railway companies rather than by motor car lir]because the former have had. longer experience.    The statement that less &apos;&apos; scrapping&apos;&apos; would be done by  the Navy than, royal Air Force rests on no foundation whatever;  and ignores the fact that  itioften more economical to replace than to repair.

Tjdiversion of this work from the trade to Government establishments at a time willevery effort is being made to provide sufficient orders to develop and maintain iadequate aircraft industry would not induce manufacturers to quote lower pncibut rather tend to increase the cost of aircraft manufacture generally.Administration of Units.    29.-(1.)  The Admiralty assume that the transfer of administration from\Air Ministry to the Admiralty should involve no extra cost.  This  is a conveneassumption, but is true, if at all, only as regards the: non-technical  branchesadministration.  In that respect (as the Air Ministry recognised in their evideJbefore the Geddes&apos; Committee) it is possible that the additional work involved imsuggested saving is the reduction of two cooks and butchers provided by the R.A1This has already been done on H.M.S. &quot; Argus&quot;  and. can be carried out on othjcarriers if the Navy agree to provide for the R.A.F. personnel.  Some of the othlproposals,  e.g., the substitution of  an R.N.  coppersmith for an R.A.F.  acetylelwelder&apos;, are only possible if the naval ratings are at present greatly under-employel    24. Another point on which the Navy fail to make allowance is the additioilexpenditure which  would be involved  by substituting Naval ratings for  airmen Jaccount of the substantially higher pay which  the  technical naval ratings  dralThese  differences, are, in, fact, remarkable.   An R.A.F, fitter or carpenter riggfof the  rank of Aircraftsman, 1st class, draws 4s. Qd. to 4s. Wd. a day; or if of 1rank of Leading Aircraftsman.  5s. Qd. to  6s. 2d. a day.   The corresponding navfratings would be 3rd of 4th class Artificers, who draw 10s.  or 9s.

In bicases naval ratings and airmen on board ship are lodged and rationed in kind,&apos;value of these allowances being approximately equal.    There is, however, no difference of  principle between the two Departments!regards numbers of  personnel required for aircraft in  a carrier, and the Air Minis!are at  all times ready to consider any concrete proposals for economies in  person]on their merits.    25. The remarks of the Admiralty upon differences in pay and length of servlare for the most part merely conjecture.   The number of applicants for the sholservice system of entry is, in fact,  on the increase,  and reductions in the.cost!living are likely in the long run to affect both  long and short services about equally.    26. The existence of surplus  naval personnel  referred to by the Admiralappears to be due to  a considerable extent to their including the establishment 1a Naval  air service in the present year&apos;s estimates in advance of any authority Iform an air service.
  taken in their stride by the Admiralty departments, though it is believed that this JS not the experience at the Admiralty  in the time of the R.N.A.S.   Conversely, &quot;o reductions would be feasible at the Air Ministry which would still require its Ipartments for the pay, &amp;e, of &apos;the Uon-naval Royal Air Force.   As  regards technical  administration, on the other hand,  it is certain  that idditions to the Admiralty staff would be required to deal with questions of storage, issue of and accounting for engines, aircraft, spare parts and technical accessories uch as bomb sights, aircraft  armament, photographic equipment, aircraft W/T, lor which at present no staff is maintained in the Admiralty.   (2.) As regards  administrative units outside the Air Ministry, see paragraph 20 wi above.   The Admiralty proposals suggest that they consider that naval  air can be effectively organised as a  kind of side-show to  the main business  of naval administration.  The units  the  Admiralty  propose - to abolish are,  moreover, not wholly maintained for aircraft embarked on carriers.Administration of Supply.   30. It has already been pointed out (see paragraph 19 above) that the Admiraltyproposals for Research and Design must necessarily involve the duplication in the Admiralty of the Directorate of  Research  in the Air Ministry, since  the  JointResearch &quot;and Design Committee  therein  proposed would be advisory  only, its recommendations being submitted to  and approved or rejected by the Admiralty.  N,D. (R)i7, The estimated additional staff would be  quite inadequate unless there  are  large  Appendixnumbers of trained technicians in the Admiralty not at present  fully  employed.    The Air Ministry could not reduce  more than two officers in the directorate of Research if the change were made,  and the relief afforded to other sections of the research Directorate would be comparatively slight.   So far as the Air Ministry is aware, Dockyard machinery is generally unsuitable for aircraft repair,  and probably extra expenditure would be necessary for special jlant for this purpose.   The Admiralty estimate that the increase in the cost of  inspection would  be 2,000.  This apparently represents  the cost of  4  or  5 inspectors.   As inspection during manufacture is contemplated and a large number of experimental naval types are being made, the amount of inspection work is grossly underestimated.   The cost is likely to be nearer  15,000  unless the  Admiralty propose to employ  surplus inspectors already included in Establishments,   Transport. The Admiralty are apparently maintaining  a larger  transport system than they actually require.  If the system can, as stated, be used with economy for the transport of Royal Air Force stores  and  personnel, the matter should have been brought to the notice of the Air Ministry in the usual way.   Storage. The  Air Ministry has, generally speaking, adequate storage accom- modation  both at stations and at central store depots.  But  the Air Ministry is prepared  to  consider using dockyard accommodation  at  any station  where  it is available. Estimated Saving on Carrier Personnel.   31.-(a.) The Admiralty apparently would propose to eliminate the Squadron Leader, Adjutant, Engine Officer and Wireless Officer on each carrier.  In  the first place these officers, under the arrangements aimed at by the Air Ministry, are pilots available for flying in emergency.  In the second, the Officers of the ship&apos;s complement w0 ,wou^  ta^e 0V6T responsibility for the  wireless of all the aircraft and the air W/T and the 30 odd aircraft engines must be at present very much under employed, and in addition they would need specialist training.    (b.) The reduction of one spare pilot per flight can be made at  any moment by the Air Ministry if the Admiralty agree.    (c.) As regards ratings it has already been stated (paragraph 23 above)  that the Air Ministry will co-operate  in any practical suggestions put forward.   In view of the much higher pay of naval technical ratings, any general substitution of these tor the R.A.F. personnel would mean considerable additional expenditure,    (d.) The proposed  amalgamation of unskilled and semi-skilled ratings  is not N.D. (E), understood^  It would  appear from  Admiral  Fuller&apos;s evidence that he  regards a carpenter-rigger as a semi-skilled.man whose work could thus be presumably under- tauen by an ordinary seaman.  This is decidedlv not the case; the work of a carpenter-      [102311                                                        c  2
rigger requires  a high degree  of  skill  and training if the pilot  is to have confidence in the machine.    (e.)  The Admiralty figures of saving, apart fsom other set-offs, are fallaiin that they assume increases in RA.F. Officer establishments for the larger carwhich will not be required.    (/.)  Even if the Admiralty figures could be accepted at their face value, it vube a curious form of economy to achieve the savings  indicated at the price of start!an entirely new  air service with an unlimited possibility of duplicated expenditas and when that service developed.                    &apos; -  -    32.  The  Admiralty&apos;s  proposals  for  &quot; economy,&quot;  however,  illustrate  tadvantage which lies with what may be called the opposition as against the &quot; Goveiment in power &quot;  in controversies of this kind.    Any defects real or fanciful in the working of the existing system lie openeasy criticism, while the system suggested for its replacement can be presented inlargely ideal aspect.

(R) 17.Co-operation of the Fleet air units with the Navy is  erroneously compared wi       combined Naval and Military operations.    The Naval Staff select one item of evidence apart from its context and on tlbase an erroneous deduction  of the Air Staff  views  on air co-operation with tlFleet.  It is almost a platitude to state that the air units working with the Navy iundoubtedly much  more  intimately connected  with the Fleet  than the  occasionco-operation between the Army and Navy.  The relation of air units with the Naido not represent co-operation in the  ordinary sense  of the word; seeing that t!units with the Navy are entirely under the operational direction of the Navy itsel    The Air Staff have never held, as is suggested, that air must be &quot;a life studfor all connected with.&quot;  The  real point  is that air operations (whether independfor ancillary) requires as distinctive a training and organisation as naval or militaioperations.  Whether the  Navy have their own Air Service or it is supplied as!present by the Air Ministry, it will be necessarily a distinctive form of duty in whitofficers of the Navy cannot all be equally versed.  A broad knowledge of the Airbe spread through the Navy, but it is also necessary that some Officers must know from A to Z.  It is a travesty of the Air  Ministry&apos;s attitude to attribute to them ansuggestion that &quot;the air-should remain a closed book to the Navy.&quot;    The Air Ministry &quot;favour every opportunity of the Navy being suffused from toto bottom with first-hand knowledge of the air and its problems.The necessity for an Officer with A ir Forces under his command possessing practice       knowledge of air work.    The Air Staff fail to understand why captains of Carriers or other Senior NavaOfficers cannot continually go into the air with machines from carriers in the safflway that many senior Army Officers go  up in the air.  Such experience could certain!be of great value.  Captains of carriers can in future be drawn from the categorof naval  officers  who have  had first hand experience of air work.  Nothing that wAir Ministry has said or now propose is  inconsistent with this.Difference between an Air Force unit serving  with the Navy and the Army.    The statement  that air work  required by  the Fleet is inherently of a fflorspecialised nature and further removed from ordinary flying than air work requireby the  Army is not admitted. &apos;  As regards  flying in the air the problems are the same; as  regards spotting anreconnaissance, the difficulties of observation, owing to  the methods of conceaimenwhich  can be practised on land, but not,so effectively  on the tabula, rasa or trie anmakes spotting and reconnaissance for the Army more complicated than similar wofor the Navy.
    Specialised training is needed for naval air work as it is also needed for military jir work.  Naval officers seconded and short-service officers  would specialise entirely In naval air work, while regular R.A.F. officers would interpose periods of other forms if air work to prevent naval air work getting into a  rut.    The minor point of closer contact of the  two services on board ship as compared vitk air  and army units at shore  stations is admitted, but the juxtaposition of naval and air  personnel on  board ship,  seeing  the  latter  are entirely  under the Naval Discipline Act, offers little more  difficulty than that  of  sailors  and marines or different grades of the Naval service itself. That if  the Fleet air  arm is part of, and administered by, the Navy  it would be Paragraph 4.     inferior  in quality compared with the  Royal Air Force.    If the Admiralty (as they apparently propose)  take the administration of the Air staff Naval Air Service in the sTfide of their present organisation and as an adjunct to remttrkB- establishments primarily proved for Naval purposes,  it is certain that the Fleet air arm will be inferior in quality to units from the R.A.F.   If at great duplication and consequent expense they provide themselves with  the full organisation necessary to a complete air service, it is probable that the standard of attainment  will still fall much below that of an  air service  with the  wider  experience and greater opportunities of experiment than will fall to  a purely Naval air service.    Reference to the British army in 1914 is merely rhetorical and beside the point. That the Naval officer pilot will not be  so  efficient as the R.A.F. pilot.              Paragraphs.    (a.)  Under the Air Ministry&apos;s proposals  air units will be manned approximately Air staff in the following proportions :                                                    remarks.

(&amp;.)  Flying on  and.off carriers represents a  high type of  airmanship.  naval officers in their second period of air service would be near  30 years of age or even over,and they would come back to air  duties much out of  practice; moreover, they wouldhave to be retrieved from naval units in all  parts of  the world.   The Air Ministrymust accept the statement  that they could in fact be released from naval duties toreturn to flying, though it is  difficult to see  how  this could be carried out without5&apos;reat inconvenience in time of expansion  of  ordinary naval requirements.    (c.) As regards continuity of service in  naval squadrons.  The  remarks of theNaval Staff make no reference to the fact which has been already definitely stated in N.D. (R),evidence, namely, that  out of 44 officers in two naval squadrons, an examination of ^^xtiae&apos;the list of the officers in two of those squadrons under present arrangements showsii have served continuously for over four years, and  another  16 for over two years.   fd.)  Naval officers  seconded  to the Royal Air Force will spend all  their time pecialising in fleet requirements, but they  will be  trained under a system which will;ive them better understanding of air problems than would be the case in a segregated taval air service.    (e.) The Naval Staff appear to deprecate the value of short-service officers, whoio four years on the Active List, all devoted to naval air work, but  contemplate inhne of war incorporating in fleet air units a proportion of R.N.R.  and R.N.V.R.)officers, who will have a much less complete air training.  (See detailed criticism inAppendix III.) employment of pilots on ship&apos;s work.                                               Paragraph 6.   An officer  whose  primary duties are  air work  from a carrier must  spend a  Air staffnnsiderable part of his time  flying from shore bases if he is to be efficient.   This onsideration  obviously affects the&apos; availability of  pilots for ship&apos;s  duties.  The  airtints, moreover, will be required  to embark,  hot always in the same  carrier, but ininy  carrier to which they may be ordered by the Commander-in-Chief.  When on &apos;oard, the time pilots are engaged on air duties would, under active-service conditions,remarks.
          be likely to coincide with the time when they would, be most required for naval dutic          Apart from that, it is difficult for an officer who has to fly by day to take his turn          night watches.paragraph .  That the R.A.F. personnel of a carrier are not fully employed.^Staff         This is a matter on which the Air Ministry are ready to consider all  concr          suggestions which would effect economies in personnel without reducing the efficiem          of air work, though, as shown elsewhere in this paper, they are not prepared to accei          in their entirety  the Admiralty&apos;s own estimates of savings  in this  respect.   (S          paragraph 18 (d), Part III, and paragraph 23, Part IV.)              As  regards the flying hours of pilots, the Admiralty fasten upon a figure whi        .  appeared in a medical report, and deduce from this that 140 hours flying in a ye          should suffice for an  officer&apos;serving on a  carrier.   This estimate  is &quot;far below t          amount  of flying which should be done by pilots of the first-line category.            .  As  regards other ranks, the  R.A.F.  personnel can take  part in general ship          duties to the same extent as, for example, artificers or shipwrights, and their duti          are no more specialised than those  of many naval  ratings whose specialisation          fully recognised by the Navy in the distribution of ship&apos;s duties.paragraphs, Reconnaissance Observers..9 ana IO.     Spotting Observers.          Observers in General.Air Staffremarks.    In dealing with the  Admiralty&apos;s remarks on this question the Air Staff haagain been misrepresented, and their chieT reasons for requiring a specialised R.A,observer in the two-seater reconnaissance aircraft, or indeed in a  lesser degree in ainew type of.reconnaissance aircraft, have been ignored.    This particular type of fleet aircraft must fight for its information.  It opera!at great distances from the fleet and can receive no support.  The nature of its dutmust take it close to the enemy fleet and within easy reach of their fighting aircralIt is most essential for it to be able to fight and to employ  the  tactics of a fight!which  chiefly  consist of highly efficient co-operation between pilot  and observergunnery tactics.  These are specialist duties, an integral part of the training ofair force officer.    The observer of a two-seater fleet reconnaissance  aircraft must, firstly, be highly skilled aerial gunner, and,  secondly, a good aerial navigator, and after thetwo qualifications comes  the need for efficiency in the  actual observing andtransmitting his signals.  No matter how versed the observer may be in sea knowledor how trusted by his C.-in-C, it will be valueless to him if his plane is shot downsoon as he  arrives within range of the enemy&apos;s aircraft.   Sound air knowledge  a:continuous work with a definite unit for a fixed period is essential.    The Air  Ministry&apos;s reasons in -the past for requiring an R.A.F. officer  inReconnaissance aircraft have always been clearly expressed.  It was impossiblethem to accede to the Admiralty&apos;s  request that these observers should be naval officeso long as they were unable to maintain the high standard on air duties which  TLIwork requires that is, so long as they were engaged in ship&apos;s work without beiidefinitely seconded to the Air Force for air work.    The Naval Staffs emphasis  upon the &quot;intricate  nature  of the duties oireconnaissance observer &quot; and &quot; reliability of his, judgment&quot;  is due to a desire ininterests of their argument to surround the wrork of the observer with a  degreemystery and  importance, which is entirely inconsistent with  their own propos(see Fleet Order 3502/1921, quoted in Appendix  (B) of N.D. (R) 17) that these dutifshould be undertaken after only seven months&apos; training mainly by junior Lieutenantof  two. years&apos; standing and upwards.  In practice these junior officers would,course, never  be sent up without  receiving  guidance from their  senior officers aswhat they should report and when they should break W/T silence.    In the spotting aircraft it is different; the naval officer, as the observer, had ]iispotting and observing to do in much the  same way as in spotting from the top ofship, and such a high degree of technical air knowledge is not so essential.  ;    The Air&apos; Ministry have made it perfectly clear that they are quite willingagree  that the majority of fleet observers should be seconded naval officers.

The personnel in the purely naval;units could not function unless they ].behind them the organisation of techiftraining  establishments,  Flying TrairiSchools, store and repair depots whichignored  in  the  Admiralty  proposals.the  Navy organises its  own Air  Senthere would be no loss of efficiency (apfrom the great administrative  difficultof severance) in  the R.A.F., but anyair   organisation   would  be,  fromcountry&apos;s point of  view, as  unsatisfactin the future as it has been proved to bethe   past.  If the E.A.F. started a NaWing to  build  and man its own  aircrcarriers  the efficiency of the Navy wonot   be affected thereby, but the prop-would be rigorously and rightly  opposbv the Admiralty.Q. 57 and Q, 58.  Lord Peel:  Beside the Fleet Orders, was any  effort made, we will say, by  Officerscommanding ships and  so on to talk  tothese  officers  and  urge   them  to  beseconded ?  Lord Beatty: No, none whatever.  Theydo not do that in any circumstances.  This  point is  dealt  with in detailPart II of the body of the Air Minireply,  but  the  following  Fleet  Ord289/1920 may be  quoted here in answer the First Sea Lord :     &quot; Commanding Officers are instruct  to bring this to the notice of all eligil  officers, and  are particularly desired  point out that the Admiralty attach gre  importance to this training.&quot;  The same  order provided for specia&apos;pay for Officers while under training.Q, 112.  If the air officer is to be seconded in all ranks of the service, that is to  say, he isto command carriers.  This is an entire misapprehension.  T.Air Ministry have never contemplated than  aircraft  carrier ship should be conmanded  by a Naval officer under secomment  to the Air Ministry.  The First &amp;Lord  has misunderstood a suggestion th:captains of carriers might well be officewho had at some  previous time obtaiuffirst-hand air experience by secondment,
mQ, 129 and Q. 145.  If  you have a  lot  of  officers . whomvou second you have  to  have an  extraLieutenants  list, you  have  no  appoint-ments which they can fill  when they riseto  higher  ranks,  and  you  make ....promotion much more difficult ....   &quot;Inour  (the Naval) scheme it is all  in pro-portion.&quot;  It is impossible  to  follow the  first sea Lord&apos;s argument.  If the hypotheticalfigure  of  350  officers for the naval airunits is taken as a basis only 30  per cent.of these, say, 120, would be, under the AirMinistry scheme,  regular  Naval Officers,for  whom outlets  for promotion  must beprovided  in the  Naval Service,  whereas,under  the Admiralty scheme, the outletswould   be  needed  for  the  whole  350.Against this largely increased number theAdmiralty can  get only a few additionalsenior  officers  posts  in a  separate naval air arm, the equivalent of whioh would be partially provided under the Air  Ministryscheme by  the opportunities  for  naval officers  being seconded  for  senior shoreappointments and for occasional permanenttransfer.Q, 204.  The Air Personnel  on board the Carrierwere, not to be allowed to carry ammunition to the guns when the  ship was fighting forits life.  (See  also  N.D.  (Ft), 2nd Mtg.   (Lord.Beatty) Q. 316.)  The,Air  Ministry objected to  R.A.F.personnel in  R.M.S. &quot; Vindictive &quot; being employed on  any work other than thatconnected   with,  aeroplanes,  and  somequestion arose as to  difficulty in providingammunition  parties.   The Air  ministry have now acceded to Admiralty wish thatthese  airmen might  be  employed  incarrying ammunition  to the  guns, if theship was heavily engaged and had sufferedcasualties.    They   have  also permittedthem if the ship is in great danger fromfire to help put out the fire.   This, afterthe correspondence  extended  for over  ayear or year and a half.  See also N.D. (R) 16.  This correspondence was largely due to -the Admiralty failing to make it clear thattheir proposals referred only  to the use ofR.A.F.  personnel  for  ships  duties  inaction.  As soon as  this was cleared upthe Air Ministry raised  no objections,  butonly suggested that  the  duties to whichR.A.F. personnel should be allotted shouldbe  such  as  require the  minimum  oftraining  and  practice.   No  such  limita-tions  as  Lord Beatty&apos;s  answer  suggestswere made.   The fact that the correspon-dence extended over a year and a half isdue  largely to the fact that five mouthselapsed between one Admiralty reply to an air Ministry letter  and two  other periods of three  months each between Admiraltyreplies to two other Air Ministry  letters.These  delays  were  immaterial  as  the correspondence  referred  to  the  futurecomplement of a ship which was not andis not yet  in commission  for   carryingaircraft.  It  is remarkable that the Ad-miralty  in  order  to make  up  a  case against the Air Ministry  should  bring up this  trivial  correspondence   time   aftertime.;i02bl]o
   226-228.  The Commander-in-Chief is not on thesame  footing to the A.O.O., Coastal Area,as he  is to the Admiral Submarines ;  . .  .He cannot make suggestions as to training for the aeroplanes.  These   statements   are   not  correct,Recent  operational orders by the  Com-mander-in-Chief can  be produced which show that his procedure for  dealing withthe A.O..C,  Coastal  Area,  and Admiral(Submarines) is the same.  The  Commander-in-Chief  can  make suggestions as to training  direct  to theA.O.C., Coastal Area, at any time.Q. 241.  The promise not to  withdraw aircraft from  the Navy without their concurrencecan only apply to aircraft on the carriers.The  Admiralty  have  no  control  overmachines on shore under the Coastal area or over reserve machines.  The statement of  the Chief of the AirStaff to which the particular point of theAdmiralty&apos;s evidence refers was a guaranteeby the Air  Ministry to keep  Fleet aircraftup  to strength.   The  Air  Staff  cannotbelieve  that  in  a situation in which theNavy  was  not   engaged,  but in  whichheavy wastage of aircraft was being  sus-tamed in other directions, the  Sfavy wouldnot be  prepared to  allow its reserves of aircraft to be drawn upon.   The sole pointappears to be that  the  Admiralty woulddislike such an initiative to proceed  fromthe Air Ministry rather than  from  them-selves.Q. 252.  The Naval Construction Branch  at theAdmiralty contains the  finest  information for  building  boats  of  every  sort  anddescription.   They have  never been con-suited or taken into the  confidence  of theAir Ministry;  The same with the engines.  Hulls for flying boats were not designedin the  Naval  Construction Departmentwhen the Admiralty  had their own  AirService, but by an outside consultant (Mr.Linton  Hope;.   This  gentleman advised the Air  Ministry also until his death in1920.  In March 1921 the Air Ministry invitedsuggestions, from  the Admiralty for co-operation in  this matter, but. no sugges-tions were ever received.Q. 314.  The case of  a Naval Commander-in-Chief is  a very important one in the factthat he can rely upon units which he hashimself  trained.   Under  the  existing scheme, no Commander-in-Chief can rely on his personal touch being conveyed  toa unit.  This  is an  exaggerated picture of theextent to which junior officers  can  be inthe  personal  knowledge  of   the  Oom-mander-in-Ohief.    In  1914  Lord  (thenSir John) Jellicoe  went  straight  to  theGrand  Fleet  at  the  outbreak from  theAdmiralty where  he  had been  servinga considerable time, and  might have hadto fight a great  battle early after taking over.  Subject&apos;to these limitations, which apply under any  organisation, there is noreason  why Naval  senior  officers shouldnot have as full  knowledge of  the  capa-bilities of officers in the Fleet air units asif they were provided by the Navy itself.
  Whether Naval Air Units are controlled by the Admiralty or the Air Ministry thebasis of the  scheme is that the  naval officers should  specialise for a period ofyears in air work, then return  to othernaval duties.    But whereas under theAir  Ministry scheme their  period  of airspecialisation would be  passed   contact with a service which existed primarily forthe air and in which the air sense is fully developed under the Admiralty schemethey will form part of a purely Naval airorganisation  dominated  by purely  navalbias.  The Air Staff are certain that underthese conditions  the Naval Officers under-standing of  air possibilities in relation tothe Navy will not be fully developed.    The Air Staff append to the above comments on Lord Beatty&apos;s final evidence a fewremarks  on some points from his earlier evidence (N.D. (R) 2nd Mtg.), also from theevidence of other Naval Officers : :N.D.  (R), 2nd Mtg., Q,. 260 (Lord Beatty).  There is a spirit of opposition  on thepart of the Air Force  Officers who, whenthey  go afloat, appear  to  be  given tounderstand that unless they fight (officially)the Naval Officers  they will be considered as letting the Air Force down. , Is it or is it not suggested that this is a picture of  the present  position ?  If theformer  it  should  be  substantiated  byevidence, if not a statement  of  this kindcan only be made to create prejudice.  This  statement was read out by  lord beatty  as   coming  from  an  officer  of,experience   whose  name   was  withheld.Lord Beatty refused to put the statementinto  the Committee after  reading it out.N.D. (R), 4th Mtg., Q. 337 (Admiral Puller).  Complaint that  officers highly efficientin naval work are liable to be removed and replaced by officers less efficient.  This  is  bound  to  occur  under  any system.    Individual  officers  cannot  beemployed on  the  same  duty throughout their  entire   career,  and  it  would  be-contrary to naval procedure to attempt todo so.  Under the Admiralty system anofficer would  be taken at some time in  hiscarrer from  flying duties,  in which  he might be highly efficient and returned to naval duties.    (R), 4th Mtg., Q. 415 (Admiral Puller).  The R.X.A.S.,  before its  amalgamationnth the R F.C., proved conclusively thatHe naval sense  provided a most suitableroundwork  ou which to graft air sense of nigh order.   Everybody will agree with  The  vast  majority  of   the  R.N.A.S.Officers were not Naval Officers,  had nonaval  training  of any  sort or kind andpossessed  no naval sense.   The examplechosen tends to show that  naval  sense isnot essential. By no stretch  of  imagination  can the esent system  enable naval officers toave a complete understanding and know- oe of the requirements of the Navy and equipment of the Air Arm.   .
N.D. (R), 8th Mtg., Q,. 2 (Admiral de Robeck).  Admiral de  Robeck enlarges  on  thedifficulties with which he had to  contendin his relationship with the A.O.C., Malta.He states  that he was eventually compelledto define the position of the Captain of an aircraft  carrier, vis-a-vis, the Air force under five different headings, and called for the A.d.s.c remarks thereon,  but  theA.O.C. merely replied  that he was unableto concur with his  (the Admirals)  views.  The Admiralty revert to this incident inN.D. (R) 16.  The A.O.C., Malta, informed Admiral deRobeck that he had referred the matter tothe  Air  Ministry.    The  Air  Ministryreplied to the A.O.O., Malta, that theyregretted. the situation which had arisenand  that  they were unable to support his attitude.     1  In brief, the Air Ministry were in agree-ment with Admiral  de Robeck and wrotethe Admiralty to  that  effect.   Admiral deRobeck does not appear, however, to havebeen  informed of this by the Admiralty.Admiral de Robeck&apos;s complaint, thereforeomits the final chapter of the story.  Noadministrative system  can be guaranteedagainst occasional cases of friction whichhave been known to occur  even betweAdmirals.  The emphasis  laid by the Admiralty onthis incident again illustrates the difficultyof the Naval Staff in  finding more solidgrounds of complaint against the workingof the present system.Appendix I, N.D. (R), 8th Mtg. (Admiral  Appendix  I  is a  written  statementhanded in by  Admiral  de Robeck enu-merating  his  difficulties  in  connectionwith  aircraft  in  the  Near East during1920-21.  Briefly he stated that:    (a.)  He continually called for  air rein-         forcements,  but  could  not  get         any from the Air Ministry.(b.) He  started  a  seaplane  base  at      Feneraki, but it was closed down      by order of the Air Ministry.(c.) When the Greek front collapsed in       September 1922 the Admiralty,       as usual, being  the only Govern-       ment  Department  capable  of       meeting the situation, sent the       &quot;Argus&quot; and the &quot;Ark Royal.&quot;       This entailed the removal of the       &quot;Argus&quot;  from   the   Atlantic       Fleet  (commanded  by  Admiral       de  Robeck), and  consequently       less efficient training in the Fleet. de Robeck).  Daring the period referred  to  (1920),the - only  operational units  in  existencewere those allotted to Admiralty and WarOffice.   The  Air Ministry were  only concerned in advising as to how and  wherethey could best be used.  Continuously  from  January to  April1920  requests  were  received  from  theC-in-C,    Mediterranean,   through  theAdmiralty for all  types  of aircraft.  TheAdmiralty consulted the  Air Ministry, whopointed out that this  request could onlybe  met  by sending &quot;Argus&quot;  equipped with aircraft working with  the  AtlanticFleet, and that  this would result in the&quot;dislocation of training  and the abandon-ment of experiments which it is understood the Admiralty require  to carry out.&quot;  Onthis the  Admiralty decided  not to meetthe C.-in-C.&apos;s demands.  It was the Air Ministry which instigatedthis establishment, and,  far  from  theAdmiralty making representations for the seaplane  unit  to   remain  there, .it  wasthe Air Ministry who, despite  the  heavy expenditure, asked them to allow it to do so,  Neither the War Office  nor  Admiraltyanticipated  the  collapse of  the Greeks.Reinforcements had to be rushed from all sides.  Admiral de Robeck complains thatthe despatch of the &quot;Argus&quot;  interfered with Fleet training, but  this was the verycourse johich he urged in  1920 when hewas in the Mediterranean.
     Answer by Air Ministry to Admiralty Paper N,D.  (R) 15 on Design, of                               Fleet Aircraft.    1.  The statement  in the first paragraph is entirely incorrect,  and does littlejustice  to the departments  concerned  and to the Pilots who have carried out the numerous trials during the last four years.   Deck-flying aeroplanes  differ  very considerably from land planes for a variety of reasons.  Deck-landing qualities andthe limited dimensions  for stowage in carriers impose peculiar difficulties,  which haveto  be studied from the very  inception of the design, whilst the  Naval  staffrequirements of crews of 3 and even 4 complicate matters very considerably.    2.  Admiralty representatives have always been present at all experimental deck-flying work, and full statements of all work carried out in 1921 and 1922 have beensent to  the Admiralty,  who have expressed satisfaction at the results obtained.    The facts are that after years of continuous and progressive research the AirMinistry have now produced ship-planes for  purely naval purposes which are vastlysuperior to anything of their kind in the world.    In August 1922 the new fleet spotters weighing no less than 2^ tons flew on andoff the deck of H.M.S.  &quot;Argus &quot; with great success.  This achievement places us far ahead of any other nation.    3.  The new types  we have built and are supplying this year  are naturally notaboard carriers because the  carriers are not built yet; but there has been nothing toprevent the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic  Fleet, ordering the new type torpedo-plane, the &quot;Dart,&quot;  to be embarked in H.MIS.  &quot;Argus&quot; since April 1922.    4.  The account  of the Development Flight Cruise  in paragraphs 3 and 5 is nota fair statement,  and if the  Committee wish to pursue  the matter the full report, ascompiled by the Air  Ministry and sent to the Admiralty, can be supplied. -      &apos;    The British cruise was to test out experimental boats, and, whilst bad weathermarred the whole cruise, one of the main objects, which was to test out seaworthiness,was certainly achieved as a  result of the bad weather.  The two standard type boatswhich were taken returned to their base in a  serviceable condition.    The American cruise referred to is not really comparable.   Standard type flying boats, exactly similar in design to our own, were used. The cruise was  carried out under  fine  weather conditions,  and  the flights were  of little value for  naval co-operation.    The Mediterranean overseas flights by standard boats compare favourably withthe American ventures referred to from a flying  point of view.    Neither in the past nor in the present  has  there been anything to prevent ourcarrying out similar cruises  with standard boats, provided a parent-ship is providedby the Admiralty.       -    5.  Note (A)  attached below shows that practically no flying boats  research isbeing carried on in  the United States.   All our information goes to prove that the americans are now  concentrating upon the design of  ship-planes in an attempt toreach our standard,  which they fully realise is far ahead of their own.    It  is difficult  to understand what object the Admiralty can have in giving the americans credit for a state of efficiency and record of progress which even they donot claim, as will be  seen by a comparison of Note (A) with Note (B).    The  implication  that  our efforts  are  inferior  is  untrue   and  much to  bedeprecated.^   6.  The general  development of flying boats is dealt with in paragraphs 2, 6 and7 of the Admiralty paper. As to this, it is obvious that certain problems in the design of a flying boat are peculiar to that form of aircraft and that research on these mustbe continuous.  The  principal requirements for a good flying boat are that it should-    (a.) Be seaworthy.    (b.) Comply with  aerodynamic requirements as to form and strength.    (c) Be as light as possible.    (d.) Have a hull which  will absorb the shock of bad landings in rough seas, and          also leave the water cleanly and easily.    Research on these  problems has been continuous, and has included the design and construction of many types  of model hull and the testing out of these types in the-Froude Tank at the  National Physical Laboratory.      [10231]                                                         E
      7.  Full-scale construction has admittedly been undertaken with caution, because  the solution of all these problems must of necessity proceed gradually, and because  the design and  construction of each experimental flying boat takes a considerable  time; moreover,  they are extremely expensive to build, and financial stringency since  the war has limited the numbers under construction at, any one time.      8.  At the end of the war the position was :-            In existence: The F. 2, F. 3 and F. 5 types. -            On order: The  N. 3, N. 4 and P. 5 types.  All these types had been designed by  the R.N.A.S. . The following progress has since  been made : i     9.  In 1919, after the  &quot; F &quot;  type  boats were in production, it l appeared that 3-ply construction in hulls was not satisfactory.  Exhaustive tests carried out on the  N. 3 and P. 5 have now proved tliis  construction to be unsound, and it  has been eliminated in the new N. 3 and P. 5.     10. In 1920 a competition was  held for Amphibians, and, as  a result of this competition, two orders were given in 1921 for amphibians of the flying-boat type (the Vickers &quot; Viking &quot; and the Supermarine &quot; Seagull &quot;.)&apos;.   ,     11. In 1921, it  was also decided to attack  the  problem of dispensing with wing-tip floats to improve the aerodynamic qualities of flying boats. For this&apos; purpose the &quot;Ayr&quot; experimental type  was ordered in the latter  part of 1921 and is now nearly completed.     12.  At the same time the problem of  seaworthiness for large hulls was definitely attacked by the order for the &quot; Scylla,&quot; which is now on the point of completion and will be ready for towing trials this year.     13.  The hull tests conducted on the first N.3 and P.5 also  demonstrated the necessity of having a resilient instead of a rigid hull, and the P.5 which accompanied the Development Flight cruise in 1922 was the first  boat of this size and type to embody this feature.  After the Development Flight cruise a new P.5 was  ordered, embodying the experience gained by  the  cruise, including  further improvements in hull design.    14.  The development of amphibian flying boats since  1921 has been rapid and continuous.  After a further experimental order in  1922  the  &quot; Seagull &quot; has been ordered for service with the fleet, and has been successfully landed on  the deck of an aircraft carrier.   The &quot;Viking VII &quot; was also ordered in 1922, and, it is believed, will constitute a definite advance on the &quot;  Seagull.&quot;    15.  At the beginning of 1923 it was definitely decided to test out the metal hull for large flying boats, and a metal hull for the P.5 is being ordered.  The specification which has been prepared for a three-engined flying boat also provides for  metalconstruction.    16.  It is impossible  to guarantee the complete  success of  any  experimental design,  and progress with the N.3 and N.4  types has been&apos; admittedly  slow.   Theoriginal  designs produced during the war have required considerable modification, which has delayed construction; whilst in both types  a series of accidents to the completed machines have hitherto prevented satisfactory trials being carried out. It is, however, hoped that trials of both  types will be carried out at  Grain in thenext few weeks.                                          .    The Admiralty statement with regard to the P.5  is completely incorrect.   Theresilient hull in this machine involved a radical departure from the design of the oldF.5 and  N.3 types.    17.  So far as the Air  Ministry  is aware, the statement  that &quot;the AdmiraltyDepartment responsible for hull  design and construction has never been consulted on the design of Flying Boats &quot; is true, not only of the present, but  also of the period when the Admiralty were responsible for  Flying Boat design..  In the early  part ofthe war the Admiralty, it is  understood, instead of attaching to the Air Departmentan officer of D.N.C.&apos;s staff, employed  the late Mr. Linton Hope, who was an outsideconsultant, to  deal with this special problem.  This gentleman continued to advise the Air Ministry on hull design until his death in 1920., When, however, the question was  raised by&apos; the Admiralty in &quot;1921,  the Air  Council,  in a letter  dated the11th March,  1921, stated that they would welcome any suggestions  which wouldpromote  co-operation in the  matter.    18.  No suggestions on the point  have been received by the Air Ministry,  whohave until now been under the impression that the Admiralty on further consideration
 were satisfied with existing  arrangements,  as  being  in accordance with  their ownJ previous practice.  The Admiralty are doubtless aware that model hulls of flying boats are tested out for the  Air Ministry in the Froude Tank Department of the National Physical Laboratory, and that  the wide experience  of this Department, and its knowledge of the hydro-dynamic problems  involved in hull design,  have always been freely placed at  the disposal of the Air Ministry, which has thus been kept in close touch with the latest developments in this branch of engineering.                                 .

Experimental.     Experiments have been carried out on the controls of a flying boat of an obsolete N.C. type (transatlantic), but these were for aerodynamic purposes,  and not with a view to flying boat development.     The latest report shows that there is very little work being carried out on flying boats in the Naval Air Service.  Modifications  are being carried out  on the F.5.L. type, but have not got beyond  the drawing office stage.     The construction of two experimental hying boats of a new single-engined type, known as B.S.1, has been postponed.                                  NOTE  (B).

APPENDIX III.                  Note on Provision of Reserve of Personnel.    1. It is difficult to remark on the Admiralty&apos;s proposals in their present nebulousform.  They contemplate obtaining reserve personnel and personnel for expansionfrom the following sources :         (a.) Active List.        (b.) Retired and emergency lists of Regular Officers.        (c.) Royal Naval Reserve.1        (d.) Royal Naval  Volunteer Reserve.    2. As regards category (a), viz., officers on the active list, the Admiralty propose; immediately on the outbreak of war to recall officers who, after a period of duty withjthe Air  Arm, have reverted  to general naval duties. ,  If  this is  feasible,  it will certainly ease the situation, if a separate naval Air Arm is not reconstituted and the[existing system continues.  A cardinal feature of the Air Ministry&apos;s scheme is that[the Royal Air Force units working with the Navy shall be partly manned by secondednaval officers.  The present Admiralty proposals imply that in the event of war suchseconded officers as have reverted to general naval duties can be made available again for air work immediately on the outbreak of war.    It will, of course,  be  essential for  this personnel  to  be maintained in regularflying practice.   It will not be easy to arrange for this practice, since the officers inquestion will be  dispersed in every class  of ship in all parts of the world.   Thisj difficulty will, however, be the same whether a separate Naval Air Arm is constitutedlor not.  A further consideration  is that such officers, at least after the completionI of their second period of air duty, would be getting old for flying on and off carriers.     3. As regards category (b), no comment is necessary, but  as an effective elements of reserve of flying officers it could count for very little.     4. As regards categories (c) and  (d) the Admiralty proposals will clearly entailIan increase in the number of the R.N.R.  and R.N.V.R. since the numbers requiredI for general naval duties will  obviously be  unchanged. It is  difficult to see how thesej R.N.R.  and R.N.V.R. officers  are to receive  their initial and  subsequent annualj training in flying or general duties  in addition to their naval  training.   In fact either the naval or  the air side of their  training will have to be scamped, so thatthey will either  be  indifferent sailors or  indifferent airmen-perhaps  both unless sections of the R.N.R.  and RN.V.R. are constituted who will come up under special regulations for much longer periods of training than personnel (Sub-Lieutenants) enrolled for  purely naval duties  whose total period of  initial  training, is only 3 months.  Elementary flying  training (presumably  under, the Air  Ministry) would take 3 months and  on top of that will be more specialised flying  at a naval shore establishment before an officer would be capable of  flying on and off a carrier,     5.  The certain  result would be (whatever.the Admiralty  may now,profess), that they would be compelled  to  open direct enlistment from civil life  into the R.N.R. and R.N.V.R. for air duties alone.  The Admiralty would,  thus be in direct com- petition with the R.A.F. scheme for direct entry of flying personnel to the R.A.F. reserve.     The most surprising feature  of the Admiralty proposals is, however, the reliance placed  on  the R.N.R.  and R.N.V.R.  to provide replacements for casualties  and for expansion of the Naval Air Arm on the outbreak of hostilities.  The Admiralty insist that R.A.F. regular and short-service  personnel, who will  normally serve 3 or 4t years continuously with the Fleet are  not and cannot be  competent to meet the Navy&apos;s air requirements  in  time of peace; but in  time of war they are apparently content to rely  on  personnel whose  air  training must necessarily be of the most scrappy character and whose period of embarkation with  the Fleet (in the case of theR.N.V.R. at least)  will normally consist.of not more than 14 days annually.  This is altogether incomprehensible, and it is clear that under the Air Ministry scheme the short-service commission officers will provide the Navy with a  reserve of personnel who will be far  more highly  qualified as airmen and who will have had in addition a far longer consecutive period of  service with the Fleet.
              The Admiralty&apos;s proposals contain no provision at all as to how and when tk          initial or subsequent annual flying and general air training of this reserve personal          will be carried out, which would in itself require an elaborate organisation.      I              6. The First Sea Lord in his evidence laid  considerable stress on the fact thai          the Admiralty did not  expect heavy  casualties in the Fleet Air  Arm, and thai          therefore they did not consider that there was the same necessity for these reserves          as in the case of the rest of the Royal Air Force.              The statement that air units  over land will be more continuously engaged in&apos;          operations than air units with the Fleet is correct, but the extent and  frequency of          the operations which the latter category will be called upon to perform,  and&quot; 4          probable consequent scale of casualties, appear  to be seriously underrated.IT.D,(R),        The First Sea&apos;Lord suggested  that the Air units with the Fleet will be calle)9th Meeting.  Upon  to       m one occasion oniy; ^en a great sea battle  takes  place, that thi          great sea battle will probably be decisive,  and that in consequence, however hea^          the casualties, this will &quot; preclude  the need for reserves.&quot;  The Air  Staff find it          somewhat difficult to understand this view, except in relation to fleet spotters, which          doubtless will not ordinarily be called upon to  go into action, unless  the  fleets or          material portions of  thein  are engaged.  As regards reconnaissance  and  fighting          aircraft, however, there will be every likelihood of these types being  actively and          continuously  engaged with the enemy&apos;s air forces, without surface craft coming ti          grips at  all and in such operations casualties will be  heavy.              The Admiralty&apos;s estimate of losses is based,  upon complete misunderstanding of          the function of reconnaissance aircraft and of the  fact that they will have to - fight          for their information.  This type of work would be continuous, and the reconnaissantt          aircraft  will not only  have to reconnoitre the enemy&apos;s fleet,  but also every type ol          vessel that leaves the enemy&apos;s coasts or at least they  will do so, if  the Air Arm ii          properly used by the Navy.              The Admiralty&apos;s attitude to the scope of reconnaissance work is in accordant!          with their mistaken belief  that any naval officer can be  put up into the air foi          observers duties with a  minimum of air training.              Further,  the proportion of total losses of  aircraft and  personnel in  a minor          naval action and still more in a big sea battle will be  far heavier than in  ordinary          land operations such as those on the Western Front in the late War, when  many of          the machines shot down  contrived to land within our lines with little or no damage          to the crew.              It is not  possible  in the midst  of  a naval action  for ships to stop in  order to          pick up casualties and aircraft which have landed in  the sea on account of engine          failure or even to locate  them.  Again it must not be overlooked that aircraft flown          off battleships or cruisers cannot be flown back  on  to these vessels, but must either          land in the sea or on the carriers; if fighting is  proceeding, it may be impossible to          manoeuvre these latter vessels so as to enable aircraft to  land on them, and in  any case          they will be fully occupied in dealing  with the aircraft which they have  themselves          sent up into the air and  will be unable to accommodate the additional numbers from          battleships and cruisers.  Owing tothese considerations and the usual  wastage due          to war strain the Air  Staff anticipate  a heavy rate of casualties in war  among the          air units with the Fleet, and consider that large  reserves  of flying personnel are          essential.  Even if  these reserves cannot be maintained actually  with the Fleet, local          reserves  could be posted to, the several naval bases on  the outbreak of war, so as to          be&apos; available for embarkation with a minimum of delay.  The Air Staff  have dealt          with this point at  some length since they feel that the Naval Staff are disposed to          dismiss this vital question of reserves  too lightly.
theme]APPENDIX IV.                  Note on Provision of Reserves of Material.   The assumption underlying the Admiralty&apos;s proposals are that at present the Navyjuid not the Royal Air Force is the user of aircraft and  aircraft material attached tohe Fleet, but the essence of  the present organisation is that the Air Ministry isesponsible for all air units wherever they are serving. There is a further assumption,iz!, that it is sound policy to keep reserves in  two separate pools rather than in oneoint pool, in order to increase stocks  held.   But if  the reserves in the common poolire sufficient (as they must be assumed to be)  the separation means the keeping of unnecessary stocks.   This is wasteful for any  kind of  store, but particularly so forliircraft material, which rapidly deteriorates  in  store and would probably become solete without ever being used.   2.  The  Admiralty  assume that  if  they  control  completely  a  portionIf the air  arm, they would  be able  to accumulate reserves  to  a greater  extentban would the Air Ministry for the same  force.  But the accumulation of reservesSip to whatever point is considered necessary is simply  a question of money, and theAdmiralty could only ensure this result by additional&apos; expenditure.  The same resultould be achieved in the same way by  the Air Ministry.
