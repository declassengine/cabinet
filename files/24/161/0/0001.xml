CABINS T.Secret.         Report of the Departmental Committee on theCP.301 (23).    Property and Endowments of the Church cf                               Scotland.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.     i.   This Departmental Committee (presided over byLord Raldane) was appointed by my predecessor in April of lastyear to advise on a step of great importance in the movement for Church Union in Scotland.  - In the negotiations for union which for a number of years have been in progress between theChurch of Scotland and the United Free Church, it has been recognised as fundamental to union that the Church ofScotland should have complete spiritual freedom and that itshould, hold i is endowments under a tenure consistent with thatspiritual freedom.          The first of these conditions has been satisfied bythe Church of Scotland Act. 1921. which declares the spiritualfreedom of the Church.          To satisfy the second condition further legislation is necessary, and it was to advise as to the nature and scopeof this that Lord Haldane&apos;s Committee was appointed.     2.   The report of the Committee (a, copy of which isattached hereto) was issued in April of this year, and its recommendations besides being approved in the recent GeneralAssemblies of the two Churches have been favourably received bythe public generally.   Indeed, there is a strong feeling inScotland that the moment is opportune for a further step towards union, and there is likely to be keen disappointmentif the ijecessary legislation is not passed before the GeneralAssemblies meet next spring.     3.   As regards the form of the legislation, I would propose to follow the lines laid down by the Committee su^&amp;ct,however, to one important variation in the matter of theredemption of stipends.   The Committee propose that redemptionshould be compulsory on the heritors, i,e, , those who pay thestipends, and that the measure of the capital payment^should^er.such amount as will purchase sufficient consols to yield ininterest a yearly sum equal to the annual stipend to be redeemed.   This, at present prices, means redemption on abasis of about twenty-four years purchase of the&apos; stipend, and Iconsider that these terms are unduly onerous on the heritors,lhat I would propose is that a heritor, should have the option to redeem the commuted value of the stipend by agreement- withthe Church authorities or to&apos;substitute for this commuted valuea fixed annual charge of a like amount secured upon the land which would he a burden of the nature of a feu duty and wouldrank as a first class heritable security and be saleable assuch .
     4,   I am aware that this departure from the scheme proposed by the Commit;tea may evoke considerable criticism,especially from Church cira^sv but I am satisfied that theproposal which I put forward is a more equitable solution ofthe problem.   It must be kept in view that the remit to theCommittee directed them to consider the matters into whichthey had to inquire from the point of view of what wasexpedient to facilitate union, end their recommendation on thehead in question was probably influenced by this consideration.Moreover.,  the proposed legislation is mainly in the i&amp;^cestsof the Churches and they may therefore he disposed to aoceptthe modification which I suggest rather than imperil thescheme for union.     5.  &apos; It is, of course, difficult to forecast to what extent, if any, a measure on the lines I. have suggested wouldbe controversial but I think that it is very desirable feet aBill should be prepared and introduced as soon as possible.          If it is decided to proceed with the Bill anannouncement to this effect might usefully be mace inParliament at the earliest opportunity.&apos;NOVAR&apos;.Scottish Office,     Whitehall.2nd July, 1923.

              COMMITTEE                          ONTHE PROPERTY AND ENDOWMENTS OF THE            CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.REPORT                             I.To His MAJESTY&apos;S SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.   MY LORD,         This  Committee  was  appointed  by  Minute of  theSecretary for Scotland, dated 19th. April, 1922.   The terms of theremit to the Committee are as follows :       &quot;To enquire and report  as to  the existing, law as affected   &quot;by the Church of Scotland Act, 1921, and as to what further   &quot;legislative  amendments or  readjustments particularly  in   &quot;relation to the tenure  and enjoyment of the property and   &quot;endowments of  the  Church of  Scotland are necessary  or   &quot;expedient in view of the coming into force of the  said Act,   &quot;in order to facilitate Church Union as contemplated therein.&quot;                     II. Introductory.   The terms of the remit clearly indicate that the adjustment ofthe tenure by the Church of Scotland of its property and endow-ments is governed by the consideration  that it is part of  a schemehaving as its aim union with other Churches.  The primary unioncontemplated is with the  United  Free  Church of Scotland.  TheCommittee therefore, while keeping in view the fact that theyhave been appointed  to represent not the special interests of anyChurch or Churches, but  those of the  people of Scotland, are ofopinion that it is important  that the recommendations they makeshould be  generally  acceptable, and  such as would  facilitateunion.   The Committee are aware  that the recommendations which follow may seem to those who have  not been brought into  close contact with the complicated teind law  of Scotland to be unneces-sarily technical and detailed.  It is eminently desirable that the law should be simplified and the matter dealt with in such a way thatthe complication will as far as possible disappear.  Such a result can hardly be obtained by any mere short cut, and an attempt of that
sort would be likely to defeat its own object and to lead to muchlitigation.              III.-Proceedings of  Committee.   The Committee held meetings in Edinburgh on 25th, 26th,and 27th  April, 6th June and  11th  October, 1922, arid on  10thand  11th January and  3rd April,  1923.   At certain  of these meetings  prominent  members, both  clerical  and  lay,  of  theChurch of Scotland  and of  the United Free Church of Scotland,and others interested in land and in questions relating to its title,were present, and discussed with the Committee the various points in which  they  were respectively  interested.  The Chairman  and members of the  Committee have  also  been in  informal com-munication with persons interested in the subject matter of theenquiry, and in much communication amongst themselves.  Theyhave  carefully  considered the various Reports of  Committees&apos; ofthe Church of Scotland and of the United Free Church of Scotlanddealing with the question of Union, and approved  by the GeneralAssemblies of the Churches.   The Committee are also indebtedto many  persons for assistance  in  furnishing information  of  a technical nature, and desire in particular to express their thanks to Mr. Alan L. Menzies, W.S., Law Agent  to the Church ofScotland, and Mr. George Turner, Clerk of Teinds.   The Committee have had before them  printed caonsiderations and relative Memorandum submitted on behalf of the Free church of Scotland, in which the points of  principle founded on  by  thatChurch are fully explained.                 IV. Fundamental  Principles.    The  Committee have  thus  attempted to make themselvesfamiliar with the views of  those most directly interested, and to study the  questions referred  to them  from different  aspects. They desire at the outset to formulate the  fundamental principles by which they propose to be guided in making the recommenda- tions  contained herein, and  believe that  a settlement based thereon will enable a re-united Church of Scotland to  make the best   and  fullest  uses of   its resources  in  the   religious interests   of   the   nation,   and  in  the   exercise   of  the powers and liberties set forth in the Articles declaratory of the Constitution  in the Church  of Scotland  Act, 1921, which are understood to  be acceptable both to the Church of  Scotland and to the United Free Church  of Scotland.    The  fundamental  principles which  the  Committee  have formulated are as follows :     (1) That the endowments of the Church of Scotland are not to        be secularised;  that is  to say, that they are to be  retained        for religious ordinances and uses, and that their  value        should be conserved for the Church.    (2) That existing life interests are to be respected.     (3) That the first charge on the endowments of. each individual        parish shall be  the proper requirements of  the parish or        locality, as such requirements may be determined by the       1 Church.
   (4) That  any  surplus  endowments  set  free  by  any  such       determination as aforesaid should be placed  in a general.       fund at the disposal of the Church.   (5) That the power of  decision as to what constitute proper       local requirements should be in the Church, acting through       its General Assembly, or a body or bodies holding delegated       powers from the Assembly.   -   (6) That in the event  of union the  assets of  the  Church of       Scotland, as part of the assets of a United Church, should       be under the exclusive control of that United Church.   (7) That the period of transition from the existing system to       that proposed by the Committee should be as short as       possible, and that every means consistent with equity and       efficiency should be adopted to attain this object.      V. General  Remarks on  the Endowments  of  the                     Church of  Scotland.   The Committee turn to a consideration of the endowments ofthe  Church  of  Scotland.    With the  assistance of materialssupplied by Mr. Alan L. Menzies and others, the Committee have prepared the following statement of the property  and endowmentsof the Church.  The statement is in some respects no more than an approximation to the true position  and is not exhaustive, butat the same time gives a sufficiently accurate general view  of theendowments  with which the Committee will have to deal.  Thepreparation of a statement full and accurate in every detail  wouldinvolve  an investigation so  complex  and occupying  so long  aperiod as to delay unduly the Report of the Committee.    Thereare various reasons for this, the  chief of which may be referredto.   (a) The  endowments  vary greatly  both in their historicalorigin and in their present  position.   (6) The Church of scotland has from its  inception been organised on a territorial  basis, andits endowments, so far as coming from public sources,  are almostentirely appropriated to the  individual  parishes.   An  accuratestatement of these endowments would thus necessitate an enquiry in every parish in Scotland,   (c) The endowments so far as con-sisting of stipend payable out of teinds vary in amount from yearto year owing to the variations of fiars prices.  Thus any figureput upon the value of stipend payable out of teind  can be true for only  one year, and may be, and of recent years has been, quitemisleading as an indication of the value of stipend in other years,or over a long course of years,   (d) The Church  has  large endow-ments originating from  voluntary sources.   A  large number ofthese consist  of local trusts  for religious purposes,  Church hallsand similar buildings,  and trusts in which the Church has an interest.   To compile an accurate list of  these would require a prolonged investigation all  over Scotland.    For these  and other reasons the Committee are of opinion thatthe statement given in the next paragraph is as  full  and accurateas can be prepared without  undue delay.   They  also  think thatthe  statement is sufficient  for  their purposes,  as though thefigures may in some cases be inexact, they are not so to the  extentof falsifying the  general view of the endowments; and  further.
a slight under or over-statement of the value of an asset does not affect the principles which the Committee must apply in dealingwith it.  No attempt has been made to value Churches, mansesor glebes.  Such a valuation would be costly and  occupy  much time, and would not, the Committee think, be of much practicalvalue.   The result of any valuation would vary according to theprinciple of valuation applied.VI. Statement of  Endowments  of  the Church  of Scotland.   The property and endowments of the Church of Scotland havebeen stated approximately as follows :           A. ENDOWMENTS  FROM PUBLIC  SOURCES.                    I. 880 Old Parishes.(1) Stipends payable out of teinds, subject to explana-    tions hereinafter  contained, per annum, ............... 240,842*(2) About 880 Parish Churches.(3) About 880 Parish Manses.(4) About 880 Glebes.(5) Obligation  on Heritors  to  provide and  maintain    Churches and Manses, and to provide Glebes.         II. 42 Parliamentary Charges provided under                  Act 5,  Geo.

TV., cap.  72    (1824), per annum, ...........................................   12,000(2) Eoyal Bounty,  being  an annual  grant  out of the    Consolidated  Fund to the  General Assembly for    Itinerant  Preachers (originally  paid  out of  the    Hereditary Eevenues of Scotland), per annum,  ......   2,000(3) Grant toward the expenses of the General Assembly,    etc., payable out of Consolidated Fund, per annum,   1,100(4) Other small annual land revenue allowances and sums   payable to various Ministers under ancient grants, the    annual  amount of which is in the aggregate incon-    siderable.                    IV: Burgh Churches. (1) Stipends of the Ministers of 46 Town Churches pay-    able by Burghs,  or out of special funds which were or    are held by Burghs.* During the war years, owing to the abnormal prices of grain, this      figure was very greatly increased.
(2)  46 Town Churches.(3)  17 Manses.        B. ENDOWMENTS FROM VOLUNTARY SOURCES        BUT ADMINISTERED UNDER ACT OF PARLIAMENT.                    Quoad Sacra Parishes.    (The endowments of these Parishes are derived from voluntarysources, but are administered under decrees of the Court of Teindsin accordance with the Act 7 and 8, Viet.,  cap. 44.)(1)  Stipends of about 500 Ministers, per annum,.........   73,784(2)  500 Churches.(3)  84 Manses provided as part of the original endow-    ments of parishes..

VII. Stipend payable  out  of  Teind.    The Committee proceed to consider the different items in theabove statement.    The first  item is A.I. (1),  Stipends  payable out  of teinds, 240,842 per annum.  This  figure includes the value of teindsappropriated to Communion elements.    This  item raises  questions  more  complex and difficult ofsolution than any other which the Committee has to consider.    Stipend is payable  out of teind in the 880 old parishes.   Ifpayable out of teind in any other parishes  such cases are very few,and the payment is not under locality.  Such exceptional cases asmay exist will  be adequately dealt with  under the Committee&apos;sproposals hereinafter contained, applicable to teinds not  redeern-able under the existing law.    The annual value of  240,842 put upon stipend out  of teindrequires some explanation, as  otherwise it  may be misleading.The latest official estimate of the value of teinds is contained inthe Parliamentary Return on Teinds  dated 6th May, 1907.   Thefigure of  240,842 is based on that Return, after making allowance for 122 augmentations of stipend granted by the Court of Teindssince the Return was issued and up  to a very recent date.   TheReturn of 1907 cannot be accepted  as giving an accurate state-ment of the value of stipend  even in 1907, as it merely  repeated the figures in a Return  dated  12th  September 1887, except incases where an augmentation of  stipend  had been granted  since that date.  The Return of 1887 in the same way in many  casesgave figures taken from previous Returns.  It thus appears  that
the value of stipend in the different parishes as  stated  in theReturn of 1907 was not in many eases the value at that time.  Inoases in which augmentations had been granted since 1887 it wasthe value for the crop and year 1906, in other cases for some cropand  year prior to  1887.   The figure  is  therefore an under-estimate of the present value of stipend out of teind, as  thoughfiars prices have fallen since the war, they are still considerably in excess of those of the Return of 1907.   The chief interest of the Church in teinds may be summarisedas  in substance  a right on  the part of the Ministers of the oldparishes  of Scotland to have competent stipends awarded to themby  the  Court of  Teinds  out  of the  teinds of  their respectiveparishes, in  so far as these are  adequate.   The teinds  of quoadsacra parishes are still included  in those of the  parishes out ofwhich they  were carved,  and thus the areas of the quoad sacraparishes  contribute  from  their  teinds  to  the  stipends of theoriginal, not of the  quoad sacra, parishes.   The  Minister of anold parish has the  right, if he thinks his stipend no longer compe-tent, to  apply at intervals of not less than  twenty years to theTeind  Court for  an augmentation of  stipend.    But  when  ithappens, as  is the  case in the majority of parishes, that the wholeteind of  the parish has been awarded to the Minister as stipend,and the  teind is thus exhausted, the stipend cannot be further increased.   A complication arises from the fact that under  Section 8 of theTeinds  Act, 1808, the Teind  Court  as  a  general  rule awardsstipends, not in money, but in  grain measured by chalders, whichhave to be converted into money before the money value of thestipend can  be ascertained.   The conversion is made on the basisof the fiars prices struck annually in each County, which rise andfall with the price of grain.  It  thus results .-that if the Teind Courtawards to a Minister a stipend of, say, 25 chalders,  this does not mean that the Minister will receive a stipend of the same value in money each year.   The 25 chalders  must be converted intomoney annually in order to ascertain  the money  value of thestipend.   The chalder is worth more or  less in each year accord-ing as the fiars prices are higher or lower, and the money value ofthe stipend thus varies from year to year according to the value ofthe chalder.    The inconvenience both to the Minister and the heritors of thisantiquated system is obvious.    The Minister cannot  tell what his stipend will be in any  one year.   If grain prices are falling hisstipend falls with them, as happened in  the years at the end oflast century; if grain prices rise, as during the war, stipend riseswith them,  to the advantage of the Minister but at the expenseof   the  heritors   concerned.    Moreover  the   fact   thatteind is often expressed in weights and measures now obsolete addsto the inconvenience of the whole system.    The system has long been subject to discussion and criticism,in particular by those who are most directly concerned.   It hasbeen  the policy of the  Church of Scotland, irrespective  of thequestion  of union; to have  stipend permanently converted intomoney.   Thus in  a Report by a Committee of the Church on fiars
prices in 1895 the present  system is severely criticised, and theviews of that Committee are  summed  up  in  the sentence :-&quot;In  actual working, it may be questioned whether any mode  of&quot;payment (of stipend) could be invented more uncertain in results,&quot;more antiquated in principle, and in operation more troublesome&quot;to all concerned.&quot;   Since that Report was presented, the system has continuouslygrown more troublesome  owing to the sub-division of large estatesand the feuing of urban lands.   For  the present purpose it is not necessary to go back beyondthe year 1920.  In that year, following on prolonged negotiations between a Committee of the  Church of  Scotland and  representa-tives of the  landed interest, there was drafted a Bill entitled theTeinds  Bill, 1920, carrying out a scheme.,that  had in the mainbeen settled by agreement between the parties.   The Bill, whichhad  been introduced into Parliament by the Secretary for Scot-land, was brought before the Commission of the General Assembly,but  after a debate was  disapproved by a  small majority, and  inconsequence made no progress.   The Committee are  of  opinion  that it would be  not only a material step  facilitating  union, but also to  the advantageboth  of  the  Church  and  the  owners  of  land,  if  a  fairarrangement were made for (;a) commutation of the varying annual value of teinds and stipends  into a fixed money value,  and  (b)redemption,  by landowners of  the teind  and stipend, with the resulting extinction of this claim on the land.   These  were also the  main objects of the Teinds  Bill,  1920,and  consequently the principle of the Bill commends itself to theCommittee.   They  therefore  propose  to  examine  the  main proposals contained in it, and thereafter to frame suggestions fora  scheme  on somewhat similar  lines, but adapted  to  presentcircumstances,  and avoiding certain complexities  in  the Bill  of1920, which were due probably to its having been drafted at atime when  circumstances  were abnormal,  and with a view  to dealing at once with those circumstances.   TEINDS  BILL,  1920.-The main purpose of the Bill was  toprovide for  the  standardisation of stipends  payable out of teindby fixing  their value in  money for all time coming, and for theredemption  by  the heritors of  the  stipend  as  standardised.Machinery  was provided by which, after an interval of years,through the process of  commutation and redemption of stipendand teind, land would have been relieved of this claim.   It was recognised that  the process must be gradual, and the year 1933was  taken  as the  year  by  which the  first  stage should  becompleted.    Section  1 provided that from and after 1933 victual stipend       should cease to depend on the fluctuations in the price of       victual, and should be  a  fixed amount payable  only  in,       money.    Section  2 provided machinery for fixing the &quot;standard value&quot;       of  victual stipend.  The average value of victual in. each       County for the 7 years from 190G to 1912 was taken as the       basis, and owing to the rise in prices  since 1912 (the result
   of war conditions) an addition of 48 per cent., was made.   Thus the  &quot;standard value&quot; of victual stipend was fixed at   the average value for the years 1906-1912 with an addition   of 48 per cent.  Provision was made for taking into account   special circumstances in any particular parish.Section 3 made provision for giving temporary supplements of   stipend to existing incumbents of parishes up to the year   1933 in cases where the &quot;standard stipend&quot; as fixed by the   Bill was less than the incumbent would have received under   the old  system.Section 4  enabled Ministers in parishes in which there were   free teinds to make application to the  Lord Ordinary on   Teind Causes for an augmentation.   No  discretion  was   left  to  the  Lord  Ordinary  as to the. amount  of  the   augmentation to  be  granted,  which  was  fixed  on an   arbitrary basis by the parties who negotiated the Bill.   No   further  augmentation could be applied for.Sections 5  and 6 provided for the  compulsory redemption of   stipend payable but of teind by heritors.  The process could   begin after the passing of the Act, and in any case would have   been completed (apart from sinking fund annuities) by 1st   October  1939.  The redemption was to be effected on  a   o per cent, basis,  either by payment of a capital  sum, or   by granting annuities secured on the lands out of which the   stipend was  exigible.   The period of  the annuities Was   limited to 50 years as a maximum.  Scottish Ecclesiastical   Commissioners were to be appointed to receive, hold and   administer the redemption moneys.Section 8  provided that the Clerk of Teinds should prepare a   Teind Boll for every parish in Scotland showing the value   in money  of   (a) the total teind of the parish,   (b) the amount  of  teind  applicable to the lands of each       heritor,   (c) the  &quot;standard value&quot; of the whole  stipend payable to       the Minister,   (d) the proportion of the &quot;standard value&quot; payable by each       heritor in the parish.   The Teind Bolls were  to be prepared as  soon as possible   after the passing of the Act, and in no case later than 31st   December 1933.Section 9  extended to all heritors the right to redeem surplus   teinds due to a titular on the basis of 9 years purchase.  (It   may be observed that under the existing law certain teinds,   to  which  reference  will  be  made hereafter, are  not   redeemable.)Section  10  abolished  the  present  method  of  obtaining   Valuations of Teinds, and substituted a simpler and cheaper   method by means of application to the Sheriff.       It also provided further facilities for the surrender. of   valued teinds.From  the above summary of the Teinds Bill of 1920  it willseen that from a monetary  point of view the important section
is Section 2.  By it the value of victual, and consequently ofstipend, is fixed.  The standardised value of the chalder of victualin the different Counties calculated according to  Section 2  wasshewn in the First Schedule of the Bill.  The value varied in each county but was on an average about  21.   To frame  a  scheme  for fixing the permanent value of thechalder was no doubt  the  most  difficult part  of the negotiations between the Committee of the  Church and  the landed interest,and as the compromise embodied in the Bill was rejected by theCommission of the General Assembly, the delicate task of suggest-ing an alternative plan now falls upon this Committee.   It is thekernel of the whole question of teinds, and a great step forwardwould be made if it  were satisfactorily settled.            I;       VIII. Scheme for  dealing with  Teinds proposed                      by the Committee.   The  Committee  now  turn  to  the  consideration  of  thescheme  which  they  propose  should  be substituted for   thatcontained  in  the   Teinds  Bill,  1920.     The  object whichthey  have  in  view  is  the  abolition  of  the  whole  systemof  teinds, including  the  system  by  which  stipend, varyingannually in amount, is paid from the teinds by the owners of  land to the Ministers; and the substitution  of  a system under whichthe Ministers will receive stipends, fixed in amount, from a purelyEcclesiastical  body, holding on behalf of the Church  investmentsrepresenting the redemption price of the teinds, and collectingthe income from these investments, and the land will be relieved from the burden  of teind.    The  Committee think  that the  recommendations  hereinaftermade would achieve this object without injustice.  It will be  seenthat  while adopting the framework of the Bill of  1920 as a basis for their scheme, they suggest several important additional provi-sions and variations in detail.            (a)  PRESERVATION  OF LIFE  INTERESTS.    As  above  explained, existing  life interests  were partiallypreserved by  Section   3  of  the  Bill.    That  Section   didnot, however, safeguard such life interests in their entirety in that (1)  only partial compensation  was  given to a Minister whosestipend  was  reduced  by  the  Bill  below what he  would  havereceived under the existing system;  (2) the compensation finallyceased in 1933.    The Committee propose that  the  life interests  of existing incumbents  should be  protected;   that  is  to . say  that  every incumbent of a parish  receiving stipend  out  of teind should be entitled, so long as he remains incumbent  of that  parish,  and elects not to  come under  the new system, to receive his stipend payable at the same  dates, and calculated by the same method, as would have been applied under the existing law and practice. The proposals  are  set forth in  detail  hereinafter.    The   same protection should be accorded to the existing  life interests of duly elected and admitted assistants  and successors.
    The Committee further propose that the existing right to apply for an augmentation of stipend should be preserved, but under theconditions hereinafter explained.    The Committee think that the suggested method of preservinglife interests will prove fair and equitable both to the ministers and the heritors, who pay  the stipends, and that under existingcircumstances it is preferable to the provisions of the Bill of 1920.   (b)  STANDARD OF CONVERSION OF THE CHALDER INTO MONEY.    Under the existing law and practice stipend is modified out ofteind in chalders of victual; that is to say, a Minister&apos;s stipend is fixed by the Teind Court at a specified number of chalders.  thus the chalder has  to be converted into money in order to ascertain the value of the stipjend in money.  The conversion,  as  aboveexplained,  is made each year on the basis  of the fiars prices asstruck  annually, and  the value of the chalder may, and usuallydoes, vary from  year to year.   Thus a stipend of,  say, 25 chaldersvaries from year to year with variations in the value of the chalder,which itself varies with the ever-varying fiars prices.    How then  to  fix  a permanent value  for the  chalder  andconsequently  of stipend?  The method adopted in the TeindsBill, 1920 (Section 2), as the result of  a compromise, was to takethe average value  of the chalder over  a 7 years period ending in1912, and to add thereto 48 per cent.  This method appears to theCommitteee unsatisfactory as a  basis  of conversion, except as a compromise specially  agreed  on between  the Church  and thelanded interest.  The seven year period adopted was  before thewar,  and  consequently   omitted  the war  years  in  whichgrain rose to  an unprecedented value.   The addition of  48 percent, was arbitrary and the result  of  a compromise.   The Com-mittee think that  in  fixing the permanent value of the chalderthe fair and equitable method is to take its average value  over aperiod of years, but  that  this period  must  be  of  considerablelength if it is to result in a fair average price.  The value of thechalder has not in the past,  except  during the war, fluctuatedviolently from year to year; the tendency has rather been for therise and&apos; fall to be gradual,  each rise or fall extending over a periodof years.   Thus a seven year period may include none but yearsof falling or of rising prices, and may be quite misleading as to the true average value of the chalder. But if a period sufficiently long toinclude the series of years both of high and of low prices be  taken,the Committee  are of opinion that  the  result is fair to all  parties concerned.  They therefore recommend :     that the standard value of the  chalder should be fixed at its    average value during the period of 50 years up  to and including    the crop and year 1922.This  period would include  the war  years, during  which thechalder rose to  quite  unprecedentedly  high values owing  to the abnormal circumstances of the times.    The Committee  think,however, that it is right that these years should be included, andthat their effect  will not be  unduly felt when  spread over the periodof years proposed.
   The Committee also think that, as proposed in Section 2 (3) ofthe Teinds Bill, regard ought to be had to special circumstances affecting the calculation of value of stipend in any parish.    (c) INTRODUCTION OF STANDARD CHALDBR IN PARISHES.   The  standard  value  of  the chalder being thus  fixed, there remains the question of its adoption in the different parishes.   TheCommittee, while realising to the full the desirability of  abolish-ing the old system with as little delay as possible, are neverthelessconvinced that it would  prove impracticable to effect the changein one step over  the whole  country, immediately on the passingof an Act of Parliament.   Some delay is essential  due, to two main  causes (hereinafter more fully explained), first, the necessityof respecting life  interests, and second, the large  amount  of highly technical work involved.  The Committee think that themore  carefully the question is studied the more apparent does itbecome that an immediate and simultaneous adoption of the  new system in  all parishes, however   desirable,  is  impossible  of achievement, and are satisfied that the proposals which they makein this Eeport would involve no delay not necessitated by  con-siderations of equity and practical expediency.   The Committee therefore recommend that the standard valueof the chalder should be introduced  in the particular parishes atthe following times :    (1) in parishes in which there is a vacancy in the incumbency       at the passing  of the Act, immediately on the Act being       passed;   (2) in other parishes, on the occurrence of the first vacancy in       the incumbency;   (3) in  Collegiate Charges,  in  which both  Ministers  have       stipends modified out of teinds, only when a vacancy has       occurred in both charges.   It is of course impossible to forecast, except in a general waybased on the doctrine of averages, how rapidly vacancies in parisheswill occur,  and even the number of vacancies does  not  tell theamount of work to be overtaken in accomplishing the transition,for the circumstances of parishes differ almost infinitely.   But theCommittee are sanguine that the work, after a little experienceof its operation has been  obtained, will proceed much more rapidly than  if it depended on  the. occurrence of vacancies alone.    Atemporary  addition  to the staff of the  Teind Office  would  benecessary to prevent delay.  The Committee therefore make thefollowing  further recommendation   applicable to  parishes  notvacant at the passing of the Act, and in which a vacancy shall nothave  occurred since that date       (4) that it shall  be in the option  of the Minister of any  such        parish to elect, at any time he desires, to have the standard        chalder introduced  in  the  parish as if a vacancy  had        occurred.Still  further,  with the view of promoting expedition, the Com-mittee have considered whether  there could be devised a schemewhich would reconcile and give effect to (a) the protection of the
life interests  and freedom of election  of the individual minister,and  (b) the general  desire which the Church and heritors have that the  period  of  transition  be  shortened.   They therefore recommend  with reference to  parishes in which  the ministers may prefer to adhere to the existing arrangements :    (5)  that it should be in the power of the General Assembly of       the Church to introduce the new system by guaranteeing       to the. Minister payment of the value  of the stipend  he       would have received under the  existing  system, and for all       other purposes to introduce the new system as if a vacancy       had occurred, the Minister having  the  option at any sub-       sequent time to complete the change by electing to receive       his stipend under the new system.The effect of this recommendation would be that, as between theChurch and the heritors, the new system would be finally adopted as if a vacancy had occurred in the incumbency.   The Minister,however,  would continue  in the same position as  before,  exceptthat he would receive his stipend from the  Church instead of fromthe heritors.    He  would  not receive the benefit  of  any  of theadvantages of the new system;  his stipend would remain payableat the  same time as at present; it would  continue to  vary  eitherupwards or downwards with the fiars prices, and he would not receive two stipends in the year in which the change was effected,a,s would  happen in  the case of Ministers  electing  to come underthe new system, owing to  the earlier dates  at which stipend wouldbe  paid.   Nor  would he acquire  a  right to  apply  for  a finalaugmentation before 20 years had  elapsed since the  date of  thelast augmentation.   On the other hand he would  run no risk ofdiminution of stipend under the new system.  The  redemptionprice of the stipend  in the case of a parish so treated would con-tinue to  be dedicated  primarily to payment  of the incumbent &apos;sstipend according to the  old system, and any guarantee  by  theChurch would in effect apply only to any  possible deficiency.   Inaddition the Committee  recommend that, if the Minister  is  not satisfied with the security thus afforded, he should be entitled tomove the Teind Court to  stay the proceedings until  the Churchhad provided a  reasonable sum by way of additional  security for any deficiency.   There should  be no  charge  on the funds  of the Church generally  or  funds applicable to other purposes.  The fact that the Church would have in hand the prepaid year&apos;s stipend at the  beginning of the change would be a considerable  security to  Church and  Minister alike that the guarantee  by  the Church from non-parochial funds would not be drawn  upon.    In order to  prevent confusion it ought to be enacted  that in every parish the transition from the old system to the new should take effect as from  the beginning of  a teind  year.   Thus if  a parish  fell vacant (actually or constructively) in May 1925, the payment for crop and year 1925 ought to  be made entirely under the old system,  and payment for the following year  under the new. Thus the year in which there would in effect be two payments of stipend would be the first year of prevalence of the new system.    It  might also be provided  that  in case  of delay in  regard to the introduction of the new system into any parish after the
occurrence of a vacancy, actual or constructive, any heritor whohad  not  actually redeemed the stipend  payable by him  should,during the period of transition, continue to pay stipend as in thelast  year of the old system-subject to  an  ultimate accounting.Such an interim  arrangement  might obviate inconvenience to ministers.   The Committee think that  these suggestions  protect the life-interests of existing incumbents and provide means of insuring thatthe change from the old to the new system should proceed continu-ously, and as fast as the nature of the work involved permits.   Inthe event of congestion, precedence should  be accorded to casesarising from vacancies in parishes, next to cases arising from theexercise of their option by ministers, and  finally  there should bedealt with cases arising from the action of the General  Assembly.      id) AUGMENTATIONS OP STIPEND OUT OF PEEE TEIND.   This question does not,  in the opinion of the Committee, raiseany difficult question of principle.   According to the existing law  the Ministers  of parishes inwhich stipend is payable out of teind, namely  the 880 old parishesof Scotland, are entitled to apply periodically to the Teind court for augmentations, provided that no  application be made within20 years of the previous augmentation.  While this is the right ofthe Ministers of all the 880 parishes, actually it is confined to a minority  of them,  because  an augmentation  can only be granted in a  parish in which there is free teind, and the teinds  are in factexhausted in a  considerable majority of parishes.   The Return of  1907,  referred to in Para. VII.., shows thatthe teinds were then exhausted in 502 of the 880 parishes.   Since-that  date there have been granted, as above stated,  122  augmenta-tions of stipend, which, it is safe  to  assume, have increased thenumber of  parishes in  which the teinds are exhausted. further the Return shows that there were then 133 parishes in  which thefree teind was under  100, and the number of such parishes must also have been increased by the subsequent augmentations.   It thus  appears that the actual number  of parishes in  whichthere is  any substantial  amount of free  teind  out  of   whichaugmentations.of stipend could be granted is comparatively  small.Even that  number is being gradually reduced under the presentsystem of periodical augmentations granted  by the Teind Court,and will be reduced yet more quickly if the  recommendations ofthe Committee are adopted.   These recommendations are :    (1)  That after  the passing of the Act only a single and final       application  for augmentation  should be competent  in any       parish;  and that, in order to give  compensation  to  the       Church  for the prospective value of all future augmenta-       tions, the Court,  in dealing with the application,  should       be directed  to take into consideration not only       (a)  all considerations relevant under  the existing law and          practice, but also
       (b) the fact that the application is final, and that  there-           after no further application can be made from the same           parish.              In cases in which  an application for augmenta-           tion is  competently brought before the  expiry  of           twenty  years  from  the  date  of  the  previous           augmentation, that  should  be  a relevant fact for           consideration by the Court in determining the amount           of the final augmentation.   (2) That  the  existing incumbent  of a parish should  have       preserved  to him the right to apply for an augmentation       under the present law, but under the proviso that only a       single and final application should be competent.   (3) That when the period for the introduction of the standard       chalder in a padsh has been  reached, the Minister, or, if       the incumbency  be  vacant, the Ecclesiastical  Commis-       sioners  hereinafter  mentioned,  should,  unless  a  final       application has already been  made, be entitled to make a       final application, notwithstanding the fact that  20 years       shall  not  have  elapsed  from the  date  of  the previous       augmentation.   (4) That it should be competent for the Minister,  subject to       the  consent   of  the   Ecclesiastical   Commissioners,       or  for  the Ecclesiastical  Commissioners  when   thern-       setves   applicants,   to   agree   with   the    heritors       of the parish as to the amount of the final augmentation,       and that the Court should be bound to give effect to such       agreement in so far as there is sufficient free teind.   (5) That in parishes in which the Minister has not elected to       come under the new system, but the change has been made       by  the  action   of  the   Church,  the  Ecclesiastical       Commissioners  should   be  entitled,  as  part  of , the   .  ;  transition  proceedings,  to  apply for a  final augmenta-       tion,  although   the  period  of   20  years  from  the       date of  the previous augmentation had not expired.  The       Minister would not be affected by that procedure, except       that the Teind Court, in granting an augmentation, would       direct how it,  and (if the Court  should think proper), any       accumulations of it,  should be applied by the Church on       the expiry of the period  of twenty years,  so as to preserve       the Minister in the same  position as if no change had been       made.   It has  been suggested to the Committee that it  would be proper to repeal the rule under which the  Court, in  determiningas to whether free teind exists  for purposes of an augmentation,proceeds on the basis of the average fiars prices of the seven years immediately preceding.   When in several of those years there hadbeen abnormally  high fiars prices, the seven years average mightshew no  free  teind,  although  in  the  year of  application, andprospectively in future  years, there  might be free teind.   TheCommittee are not prepared to advise the repeal of the rule, whichin normal circumstances operates equitably.  But they think thatas regards (a)  applications  for  augmentations  made before the expiry of 20 years from the previous augmentation,  and (b) the
consideration of the matter of compensation for abolition of futureaugmentations, the discretion of the  Court of Teinds should  beliberated from the restraints of the seven years average.   In the case of parishes in which the teinds have been exhausted,an application for augmentation of stipend would of course  befutile.   But there may be difference of opinion whether teinds areor are  not exhausted, and the Committee think  that there  oughtto be some means of having set at rest, within a reasonable time,doubts as to whether an application for augmentation will or willnot be  made.  The Committee recommend   that it be provided  that if no application for  an augmentation   be made within  four months of emergence of the event  which   authorises such an  application, or if an application be unduly   delayed after  presentation, any person interested may apply   to the Teind Court, which should be authorised to \give such   remedy as in the  opinion of the Court  the circumstances   require.   (e) EXPENSES OF  FINAL APPLICATIONS FOE AUGMENTATIONS.   The Committee  think that it would  be a hardship on  manyMinisters to leave them subjected to the expense of  making thefinal application for an augmentation.   In the  past  it has oftenhappened that a Minister to whom  an  augmentation has beengranted has  found the proceeds of the first year of it largely, ormore than, exhausted by  the expense of obtaining it.   The Com-mittee  therefore  suggest that  Ministers  be   relieved by the headquarters of the  Church of the expense  of making finalapplications  for augmentations  of stipend.   The Church  might provide  a  special  fund  for  the purpose.  The  propriety, and indeed necessity, for such a step are  specially evident in cases inwhich the Church  may itself introduce the new system withoutthe  consent  of the Minister  of the parish and in  which the ecclesiatical Commissioners would be the applicants.   It  should also be considered by the Teind Court  whether, inthe  changed circumstances, the procedure in  final  applicationscould  be simplified, and the expense correspondingly diminished.           (/) REDEMPTION OF STIPEND BY HERITORS.    As previously explained, Sections 5 and 6 of the  Bill of 1920 provided for the compulsory redemption by heritors of the stipend payable by them, either by single payment, or by the grant of terminable annuities secured on the lands out of which the stipend was exigible, calculated to  extinguish the heritors&apos; whole  obliga- tions  in a maximum  period  of 50  years.  In  both cases  the redemption was  to be made on a 5 per cent, basis, that is at 20 years  purchase, and payment was to  be made to Scottish Ecclesi- astical Commissioners to  be appointed in terms of the Bill.     The Committee, while  approving in  principle the provisions of the Bill of 1920, think that  in  present circumstances  certain alterations can be  made  which will meet criticisms to which the scheme of the Bill, if applied to the proposals of the Committee, appears to be open.  The chief of these criticisms are as follows. (a)  The scheme, in  proposing that all redemptions  should be on  a  5 per cent, basis, made  no  provision  for the  inevitable
fluctuations in the value of money,  and would result  in manycases in a heritor paying either too  much or too little accordingto the value of money at the time when the particular redemptionwas  made,  (b) The scheme affords no security that the Ecclesi-astical Commissioners would receive, whether the redemption were affected  by single payment  or by the grant  of  terminableannuities, a sum  sufficient when invested to produce in interest the amount of stipend payable by them.   The Committee therefore propose that the scheme of the bill of 1920 be modified  in certain  respects,  and their recommenda-tions may be summarised as follows :    (1)  That on the Teind  Boll of the parish becoming  final, as       as hereinafter explained,* it should be compulsory  on every       heritor to  redeem  the amount of stipend  shown therein       as payable by him.   (2)  That redemption should be made either by single payment,       or, at the option of  the heritor, by payment spread over a       period of years; in both cases all payments to be  made to       Scottish Ecclesiastical Commissioners to be appointed as       hereinafter explained.   (3)  That in the  case  of redemption  by single payment the       heritor should pay such sum as would, when invested at the       time in consols, produce  in interest an annual sum equal       to the  stipend to  be redeemed; or,  if he prefer,  transfer       such an amount of consols as would produce in interest       the annual sum required.   (4)  That in the case of  redemption by payment spread over a       period of years :        (a) The stipend to be redeemed, together with  a  fixed           annual addition for Sinking Bund, should be converted           into a  rent charge secured on the  lands from which           the stipend was payable.       (b) The addition to be made  for  Sinking Fund should be           10 per  cent, of the annual stipend to be redeemed, as a           minimum, or  such larger sum as the heritor might           desire, provided that the addition for  Sinking Fund           should in no case be less than  1 per annum.      (c); The rent charge should be payable in equal proportions           at Whitsunday and Martinmas.      (d) It should  be  the duty of the Ecclesiastical Commis-           sioners to invest in consols all sums received by them           as Sinking Fund, together with interest on all  previous           investments.      (e) When   the Commissioners  had  by  these  means           accumulated a sufficient sum invested in consols  to     .      yield in interest the amount of stipend to be redeemed,           the rent charge should automatically terminate..      (/) During the currency  of  the  rent  charge  the heritor           should have the option at any term of Whitsunday or           Martinmas of  terminating the rent charge by paying* See Para. VIII. (j).
          such sum, or transferring such an amount of consols,          as would complete the redemption.   (5)  That when redemption had been effected by single pay-       in ent, or  a rent charge  had been  constituted as  above       explained, the Commissioners should pay his stipend to       the Minister in equal proportions  at  Whitsunday and       Martinmas (or such other terms as  might be found more   IA       convenient), and the Ministers claim for stipend should be   W      - against the Commissioners only.   (6)  That  the  Commissioners should be entitled in paying       stipend  to deduct the cost of  remitting from the sums       paid.   (7)  That it should not be necessary for the rent charges to be       registered  in the Register of Sasines,  but that it  should       be  the duty of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to compile,       and keep up to date, a  list of all  rent charges created,       arranged alphabetically in  counties  and parishes, and to       keep at the office of the Register of Sasines in the General       Register House, Edinburgh, a copy  of the list brought up       to  date.   The list would then be open to all purchasers of       lands  or others having an interest,  and should  be  made       available without charge.                             ,   (8)  That any mortgage for a capital sum raised by a heritor       with a view to redeming stipend in one sum, and any rent       charge granted in redemption of stipend, should rank on       the lands to which it  applied preferably to  all  existing       securities  or  burdens,  other than   burdens  incident  to       tenure.   (9)  That heritors who were in actual receipt of  the income of       any lands  under limited  titles  (e.g., trustees, heirs  of       entail, liferenters&apos;, heritable creditors in possession,  etc.)       should, notwithstanding such limitations in their titles, be       under all the obligations  imposed upon, and have all the       rights possessed by, heritors who were absolute owners of       their lands, as regards redemption  of stipend, including       power to raise money in  capital sums to pay redemption       price, or to grant Bonds of Rent Charge with sinking fund.       To provide for cases in which the sums were  small, there       ought also to be power to pay the sum, and to add it to       the claim  of the heritable  creditor under his deed  of       security.   An   example  will perhaps  make  the  suggestions clearer.Suppose that the  share of stipend to be redeemed is  20.  If theheritor elects to redeem  by single payment   he  will  pay to  theCommissioners a  sum sufficient to purchase  800 of consols, thecost  depending on the price of consols  at the time redemption ismade;  or  he  may, if already the owner of consols, transfer  800thereof.   If, however,  he elects to redeem by payments  spreadover.a  number of years, he will constitute a rent charge over the lands out  of which the stipend is exigible amounting to  22 as aminimum, payable half at  Whitsunday and half at Martinmas,and consisting of  20 for stipend and  2 for Sinking Fund.  TheCommissioners  will pay  10 each  half year to the  Minister as
stipend, and will accumulate the additional  1 received by themeach half year by investing it in consols together with interest onall  previous investments.   When  the  Commissioners  are inpossession  of  800 of consols  the process &quot;is complete and the rent charge terminated.   It is calculated that,, when the additionfor Sinking Fund is the minimum of 10 per cent, of the  annualstipend, the whole process  will be complete  in about 50 years.This scheme, though perhaps at first sight somewhat complicated,is  in the opinion of  the Committee  perfectly practical, as it isanalogous to the method adopted by Insurance Companies, andproved sound by long experience, in the granting of endowmentpolicies.    The suggestions appear to  the  Committee to  have  certain advantages.  No  undue  burden is  put upon the  heritor,  and security is provided that the Commissioners  will  receive  sumssufficient to enable them to pay the stipend due.    Further theMinister is relieved of the trouble, and in many cases the expense,-of  collecting his stipend from individual heritors,  and receives it from a purely Ecclesiastical body, at fixed  dates during the  yearto which it applies, and not at the greatly postponed dates.incidentto  the existing system of payment according to fiars prices.   TheCommittee think that these advantages to the Minister will morethan compensate him for the  small deductions from his  stipendwhich may be necessary to  defray the Commissioners&apos; expenses.    The Committee have been led to make the suggestion that the bonds for terminable rent charges be not registered in the Register of Sasines  from a desire to obviate expense  to heritors.    They suggest that when stipend has  been redeemed a simple receipt showing this should be given by the Commissioners to the heritor. , The production of such a receipt when  required would obviate all further enquiry.  The non-production of such a receipt would put purchasers of lands and others interested on their enquiry, and what the Committee suggest would provide easy access to informa- tion as to the rent charge  for the redemption of stipend.   The Committee believe that redemption of stipend, once inaugurated, would go on.rapidly in few cases extending over the maximum period and that thus the special provisions proposed by the Com- mittee would have only a  temporary and limited operation.    In many cases payment of stipend is made in very small sums, and in these the claim would be extinguished by payment of corres- correspondingly small capital sums,  and there would be no occasion for a rent charge.  -         (g) SCOTTISH ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSIONERS.    The foregoing provisions  as to the payment and redemption of stipend necessitate the existence of a body of trustees to receive, liold  and  . administer   the  sums  to   be  paid   to  them  on behalf  of  the  Church  by  heritors.     The   Teinds   Bill, 1920  (Section  6 and  Schedule  4),  proposed  to  create. such a  body   entitled the  Scottish Ecclesiastical  Commissioners.  The Committee approve of these provisions of the Bill and recom-  mend that they should be adopted in any future legislation, subject  to necessary  adjustments.    They think,  however, that the
approval of the Secretary for Scotland should not be required forthe appointment of Commissioners by the General Assembly.    Since the Bill of 1920 was framed, there has been passed an act* confirming a Provisional Order by which Church of ScotlandGeneral Trustees have been incorporated.   The Act  inter  aliatransferred the  heritable properties  and investments  previouslyvested in certain Standing Committees of the Church to the newlyincorporated General Trustees, and gave them certain powers of investment and  administration.    It appears to the Committee to be a  matter for consideration whether the General Trustees should not also act as the  ScottishEcclesiastical Commissioners.  The Committee  see no objection tosuch an arrangement, and think it has some advantages, but  asthe question is concerned with the internal administration of theChurch, the Committee think that the wish of the Church on thesubject should receive effect.      (h) REDEMPTION  OE  FEEE TEINDS BY  HEBITOES.    As a general, rule a heritor who does not own the teinds of hislands is entitled to purchase, and the titular is  bound to  sell, thefree teind at nine  years   purchase, and many heritors  havepurchased the  teinds of then? lands on this  basis.  There are however  some exceptions to the right to purchase, as by the act of  1693, C. 23, the following teinds cannot   be sold, viz. : (1) Bishops&apos; teinds, so long as belonging to the  Crown; (2) teindsgranted to Burghs for pious uses;  (3) teinds belonging to colleges and hospitals, and (4) teinds in general destined or mortified forpious uses.    Bishops&apos;  teinds  fell  to the  Crown  on  the  abolition  ofEpiscopacy.  Under recent  Acts they can be purchased from theCommissioners of Woods and Forests, and the free teind  nowcollectable by the Crown amounts only  to a  sum varving  from about  1000 to  2000 a year.    Teinds destined  to  pious uses or belonging  to  colleges  andhospitals may still not be sold, and  so cannot  be  redeemed.  Asexamples of such cases  reference may be  made to the universities and the Chapel royal of Scotland.    The  Universities of Glasgow and St. Andrews both  haveamongst their endowments  certain surplus teinds.  The ChapelRoyal founded  by  Alexander  I., was  in 1502 erected into  aCollegiate Church and endowed with various  Churches and landswith their teinds and revenues.   The income  from its  presentendowments, consisting of  teinds, feu duties  and an annual rentpayable in grain, has  since 1868 been  appropriated entirely toTheological  Chairs in the  Scottish  Universities,  as  follows : To the Professorship of Biblical  Criticism at  Edinburgh,  one-third ; to the Professorship of Divinity at Edinburgh, one-sixth;to  the  Professorships  of  Biblical  Criticism   at  Aberdeen andGlasgow, one-sixth each; and to the Professorship of EcclesiasticalHistory at St. Andrews, one-sixth.* Church of Scotland (General Trustees)  Order  Confirmation Act,      1921.
   The revenue divisible amongst these Chairs was in 1868 about 2000  a  year, and  in  1913 was   1713.   It  was  seriouslydiminished.by the war, falling in 1918 to  373, since when it hasgradually increased  and was in 1921  694.   The Committee  think that, in pursuance of the general policyof abolishing the whole teind system, it should be  made  com-pulsory on  heritors to  redeem by purchase from the titular allsurplus teinds.  The amount of these is relatively  inconsiderable,while the trouble, and even expense, applicable thereto is out ofall proportion to the pecuniary interests involved.   The redemp-tion  of stipend furnishes an  occasion when teinds  could  most conveniently be abolished.   In the great majority of parishes those in which stipend already exhausts or will in  future exhaustthe teinds the proposal of course  involves nothing  at all.   TheCommittee think that the redemption of all free teinds should bemade on a basis similar to that recommended in the case of theredemption  of stipend,  except that they think that the price of nine years purchase now applicable to teinds, which are redeem-able according to the existing law, ought to be maintained.   The Committee  therefore recommend :    (1) that  on the Teind Eoll of the parish becoming final, as       hereinafter  explained,* it  shall be compulsory  on  every        heritor,  who does not own the teinds  of his lands, to       purchase  from  the   titular all surplus teinds,  if any,        including teinds the property of the Crown;   (2) that  in the  case  of teinds redeemable under the existing        law, such purchase shall be  made at nine years  purchase;   (3) that   in the  case  of  teinds not  saleable and  there-       fore    irredeemable   under   the   existing   law,  such       purchase  shall only  be made  either (a)  by paying to        the titular such a sum as will, when invested in consols,       produce in  interest an annual sum equal  to the  surplus        teind to be  redeemed, or by transferring consols  of  equal        amount; or, (b) at the option  of the heritor, by creating a        rent charge secured  on the lands  out of which the teind        is exigible,  for the amount  of the surplus  teind, together        with one-tenth part more thereof as sinking fund;   (4) that the rent charge shall be payable in equal proportions        at Whitsunday and Martinmas for a period of 50 years, on        the expiry of which the surplus teind shall be held to be        redeemed.           (It will be observed that (4) involves a  slight variation        from the scheme applicable to  rent charges for the redemp-        tion of stipend which the Committee suggest, in that the        rent charge terminates after a definite period of 50 years.        The Committee  have made the variation  in view of the        relative smallness of  the interests here involved, and the        advantage of definiteness.)                       (j)  TEIND  ROLLS.   The Committee recommend that  in order to enable stipends* See Para. VIII. (j).
to be put as rapidly and exactly as possible on a finally ascertainedbasis, there should be prepared a Teind Roll applicable to each ofthe parishes of Scotland.   Such a Teind Roll  would be finallyadjusted by the Clerk of Teinds, whose duty in this respect wouldbe that of an administrator.  He would  have to see that titleswere respected and legal uncertainties as far as  possible avoided,the Teind Court being the final arbiter on  such points. But they desire to add that this work of the Teind Clerk would be  muchlightened  if the parties could agree on the preparation of a draft frr  his consideration and approval,  and this  were in  the  firstinstance undertaken locally by agreement between the Minister,the heritors and any others possessing title.   This work shouldwhere practicable be done.   If it  can  be done much time may be saved.   The  process  might commence at once  as soon as  thenecessary  Act had passed.   The Committee  think  that  some means  must be found by  which  the  Teind  Roll  shall  become final  and  binding  onall concerned&apos; after a certain limited time.  If the Teind Roll isnot made final  any heritor whose teinds were  unvalued might,even after the lapse of years, claim to have his teinds  valued,  andif the teinds  when valued  were less in amount  than  the stipendpayable by him as shewn in the Teind Roll,  he  might surrender.This would create a shortage in the stipend, and might necessitate a re-allocation among the heritors whose teinds were unexhausted.But meanwhile such heritors would  have redeemed  the stipendpayable  by  them, and also  in some cases  the free teind,  andinextricable confusion would be.created.    The Committee think it is no  hardship on a heritor to requirehim to decide,  once for all, within a reasonable time,  whether heis satisfied with the value of his teinds as entered on  the Roll, orwhether he will take steps for a formal valuation, and also whether he will surrender.    The Committee  therefore think that a  time limit must be imposed both for valuation of unvalued teinds, and for surrender of teinds  whether valued or held as valued  from  the heritorsacquiescence in the Teind Roll.   The Teind Roll will thus in due course become final, and the process of the gradual extinction ofthe  whole system  of  teinds be  enabled  to  work smoothly  anduninterruptedly.    The Committee&apos;s  recommendations may be  summarised asfollows :     (1) that a Teind Roll be prepared for every parish in Scotland,        specifying in money -        (a) the total teind of the parish;        (b) the amount of that total applicable to the lands of each           heritor;       - (c) the value of the whole stipend payable;        (d) the proportion  of that value payable by each heritor.        The Clerk of Teinds  should adjust the Roll, but in doing      -  so he should avail himself of all materials laid before  him       by agreement of the parties,  for.which  every encourage-        ment should be given.
   (2) that the Teind Roll shall be prepared and issued for each      parish as soon as practicable, having regard to the purposes      for which it will be required.   The object aimed at is that      a Teind Roll for the whole of Scotland shall be  prepared      as soon as possible;   (3) that the fees in connection with the preparation and issuing      of the Teind Rolls  shall be paid to the Clerk of Teinds by      the heritors concerned;   (4) that valuation  of unvalued teinds shall not be competent      to any person unless application to the Sheriff to appoint      a valuer to fix the annual agricultural value of the lands,      as  hereinafter  provided for, has  been made within four      months after the issue of the Teind Roll;  if such applica-      tion  has not been made within  such period the teinds      shall be held to be valued  by acquiescence in the Teind      Roll;   (5) that surrender of valued teinds shall not, in cases in which      the teinds were already valued at the date of the issue of      the Teind Roll, be  competent unless made within four      months after the issue of the Teind  Roll;  or, in cases in      which a valuation  is obtained after the issue of the Teind      Roll, within two  months after the issue by the Clerk of      Teinds of a Certificate of the amount of the valued Teinds;      surrender of teinds held to be valued by acquiescence shall      not be competent unless made within  six months after the      issue of the Teind Roll;   (6) that the conversion into money of teinds shall be made on      the following basis :        (a) in the case of unvalued teinds, on the average of fiars          prices during the 50 years up to and including the crop          and year 1922;       (b)  in the case of teihds valued in money, according to the          money value as shown in the Decree of Valuation;       (c)  in the case, of teinds valued in victual, (1) where a basis          of  conversion  has been specified in the Decree of          Valuation, by reference to that basis; (2) where a basis          of conversion has not been so  specified, on the average          value of fiars  prices during the  50 years up to and          including the crop and year 1922.                 (7c)   VALUATION  OF .TBINDS.   The existing method of Valuation of unvalued  teinds  by actionin the Teind Court is in many cases, where only small amounts ofteind are  in  question,  cumbersome   and  expensive out  of proportion to the importance of the matter at stake. .   Section  10 of  the Teinds Bill, 1920,  substituted  for theexisting procedure a  simpler and cheaper method by  means of application to the Sheriff.   The Committee approve of the provisions of  Section 10, and recommend that the method of valuation of teinds therein set forthbe adopted with the necessary  adjustments.    Their recommenda-tions are as follows : 
   (1) that the  existing procedure  for  valuation  of  teinds  be      abolished;   (2) that any heritor whose teinds are wholly or partly unvalued,      or any minister whose stipend is wholly or partly exigible      from unvalued teinds, or where the benefice is vacant  the      Ecclesiastical Commissioners,  should be entitled to apply      to the Sheriff to appoint a valuer to fix the annual agricul-      tural value of the lands;   (3) the  valuer shall, after such  enquiry as  he shall  think      necessary, and hearing parties if so desired, issue a certifi-      cate of valuation showing the annual agricultural value1 of      the lands;   (4) within 15  days of the issue of the certificate of valuation,      any party interested  may appeal to the Lord Ordinary on      Teinds, who may either approve the certificate of valuation      or amend it.   The decision of the Lord Ordinary shall be      final,  and  no  appeal  to  the  Lord   Ordinary  shall      be competent  when  the annual  agricultural value of the      lands as shown in the certificate  of valuation does  not      exceed  100;   (5) within  10  days of  the  certificate  becoming  final,  the      person who  applied for the appointment of a valuer shall      lodge it with the Clerk of Teinds, who shall thereafter issue      a certificate of the amount of the valued teinds.   Such      certificate shall be recorded, in the Teind Office, and shall      be evidence of the  valuation to the same  effect as  an      extract Decree of Valuation of the Teind Court issued in      accordance with the present practice.             (I)  SURRENDER OF  VALUED TEINDS.   The  Committee propose  that the  provisions of Section 10  and schedule VI. of the Teinds Bill, 1920, as to surrender of valuedteinds,  should be  adopted in  so  far as  consistent with  therecommendations in this Report.                  (m)  VESTING  OF  STIPEND.   Under the existing law  a Minister&apos;s stipend  vests in him inhalf-yearly portions at the  terms of  Whitsunday (15th May)  andMichaelmas (29th September).   Thus, apart from the question,ofAnn, if the Minister be inducted prior to  Whitsunday, a whole year&apos;s stipend vests in him  (that is,  one half at Whitsunday andone half at Michaelmas); if between Whitsunday and Michaelmas,a half year&apos;s stipend vests in him at Michaelmas; while if he benot inducted until after Michaelmas, he is entitled to no stipendfor that year&apos;s crop.  It will be apparent that great hardship may arise to a new Minister from  this state of the law.    If,  as  an extreme example, a Minister be inducted on 30th September, nostipend  will vest in him until 15th May in the following year;and  as stipend is only paid after the fiars prices for the year havebeen struck (generally about February of the following year), hewould have to wait for nearly eighteen months after his inductionbefore actually receiving any payment at all, although a half year&apos;s
   Such are the recommendations as to teinds and stipend whichthe Committee desire to make.  They are fully conscious that theproposals involve delay, but believe that some delay is inevitable in any scheme that is to be both equitable and practicable.  Thiswas recognised in the  Bill of 1920, by which temporary supple-ments to the standard stipend were provided for up to 1933, whileredemption of standard stipend  by heritors could be delayed until30th September, 1939,  and even after that date annuity  charges would have remained payable for a period  in  some cases of 50years.   The  necessity for  delay is due  to  two  main  causes-thepreservation of  life interests, and  the  extremely complex  andtechnical character of the work  involved.   (1)  The  preservation  of  the  life  interests of  existingincumbents necessitates the continuance of the present method of payment of  stipend in each parish until, by one or other of themeans  suggested, the   standard chalder is introduced in thatparish.   Until this has been done,  it is impossible to apply thenew system, or to complete the  framing of the new Teind Roll ofstipend had vested in him at each of the preceding terms of Whit-sunday and Michaelmas.   The  Committee  think  that  under  the new  system suchanomalies can be abolished, and therefore recommend   that all stipend payable to Ministers  by  the  Ecclesiastical   Commissioners should vest de die in diem.Ministers would thus (apart from Ann) be entitled to stipend fromthe day of their induction, and would receive the first payment atthe first term of Whitsunday  or  Martinmas thereafter, or  at whatever other times where found  convenient earlier  or lateraccording to the dates of collection of the revenue of the investedfunds.   It will be  observed that the result would be that  if an existingincumbent  were to elect to come under the new system he wouldin effect receive two years&apos; stipend in the year in which the change was effected.   This would be simply an acceleration of an existingright, and  would follow  from the earlier dates at which stipendwould be payable.   It ought not to be overlooked that the proposed  new rule wouldhave an effect (not necessarily a prejudicial effect) on the Ministers&apos;Widows  Fund.   That  fund has.a certain right to the incomearising when  an incumbency is vacant.   If the deceasing or out-going incumbent received stipend up to the day of  occurrence ofthe vacancy, the vacancy of stipend  would commence from a later date than at present.    On the other hand, the right of the newincumbent  commencing on the day of induction and not in anycase dating back to the previous term, the Widows Fund would benefit presumably in the aggregate to an approximately corres-ponding extent.
the parish, and the redemption by the heritors of the stipend asshown therein.  (2) The preparation of a Teind Roll involves a mass of detailrequiring great technical knowledge and experience.    This  isparticularly  the case  in  parishes  where  the lands  have  been largely sub-divided and the heritors are consequently numerous.In  such parishes  the stipend is  payable by hundreds  or eventhousands of different heritors, to  each of whose lands a share  ofstipend has to be apportioned, large numbers of whose teinds may require to be valued, and all of whom will be under the obligationto redeem the stipend payable by them.    While it is true that the work at first imposed on the TeindOffice may be more than it can immediately overtake, the Com-mittee anticipate that when once the new system is introduced itwill proceed with  accelerating rapidity and efficiency.  Should it appear that more rapid progress can be made by temporary addi-tions to the staff of the Teind Court, steps should be taken in thisdirection.    The Committee further think that, though the process will  be gradual, this should not operate as  any bar to, or  suspension of,the union  of  the  Churches.   For  the  principle will have beenestablished  and will  come into immediate operation.    The old system will have been abolished, though it will, as is natural witha system that has its  roots in pre-reformation days, be some years before  the  last  trace   of  it disappears.  If  the Committee&apos;sproposals receive early  Parliamentary sanction, no inconsiderablenumber of the parishes of  Scotland will be actually  under the new system before any union  can, under  the  Constitutions  of  the churches, be accomplished.      IX, Churches, Manses, Glebes, Churchyards and                  Ecclesiastical   Assessments.    The Committee turn to consider Items A.I. (2),  (3), (4), and (5) of the Statement  of Endowments contained in Para.  VI.    These items are the Churches, Manses, Glebes,  and Church- yards in the  880  old parishes, and Ecclesiastical Assessments on heritors.  It is convenient to consider them together for reasons which will appear hereafter.     A short explanation  of the existing position of these items may prove useful  before the Committee proceed to state  their recom- mendations thereon.     Parish Churches in the old parishes of Scotland are in a unique position in law.  They are buildings dedicated to the use of  the parochial  community as places of public worship, and  while so dedicated are placed extra commercium.  There  are no written titles.  The heritors are joint owners of the Church qua property,  but hold the building qua Church as trustees for the parish.     Thus, if  a Parish  Church ceases  to  be used  as  such,  the  building,  and the site  unless in the churchyard, revert to  the  category of ordinary property, and belong to the heritors jointly.     Manses in the old parishes are also in a unique position in law.  The tenure is allodial and not feudal; and, though the property is
not in the heritors, as in the case of Churches, but in the incumbentand his successors collectively, yet, if the  heritors build a  newmanse,  the fabric of the  old manse, though not the site, becomestheir property.    Ecclesiastical Assessments on heritors are defined by Statuteas  &quot;All assessments for  the purpose of defraying expenses con-&quot;nected with the building, rebuilding, or repairing of Churches or&quot;manses, or the designing or excambing of sites therefor, or the&quot;designing or excambing of glebes or additions to glebes, or the&quot;designing or excambing of sites for additions to churchyards, and&quot;the  suitable  maintenance  thereof  (including  the  building,&quot;rebuilding, or repairing of churchyard walls), in any parish.&quot;*    The assessments are  imposed on the heritors,  who are all thelandowners  in  the parish, including feuars,  and as  land  is capable of infinite sub-division, so the heritors may be indefinitelyincreased in number.   In practice  the levying of assessments hasbeen  found a matter  of considerable difficulty and complexity,particularly in districts where there has been extensive feuing for building purposes.  The assessing of small  feuars, each of whom would be liable for a very small sum,  was so troublesome, that the ecclesiatical Assessments (Scotland) Act,  1900,  Section 3, gaveto  such small  heritors  relief  which  practically  amounted toexemption.    Ecclesiastical assessments may  be levied, as appears from thestatute quoted above, in connection with (1) Churches and Manses,(2) Glebes  and  (3) Churchyards.   (1) Assessments  for  building, rebuilding,  or  repairing  ofChurches and  manses  are at the present  time by far the mostimportant.   They impose on an average of years a substantialburden on  the heritors,  and have been the cause  in certain  casesof  considerable  friction.   In  recent  years  it  has  frequentlyhappened that the Church authorities  have desired to do  more extensive repairs on Churches than the heritors were legally boundto  execute, and in such cases arrangements have been made bywhich the Church has  borne part of the expense.    As regards manses, the obligation on the heritors is to providea competent manse for the Minister of the parish.  The minister is himself responsible for ordinary wear and tear.   (2) The obligation to provide a glebe for the  Minister of the parish is imposed by law in the first place on heritors owning Kirklands, or, if there are  none such, on all the heritors.   If there isno glebe, or one  of less than the statutory extent, a  glebe  is designed by  the Presbytery out of Kirk lands,  of,  failing  such,temporal lands.   The heritor  out  of whose lands a  glebe  is designed, has a right of relief against the owners of the same classof  lands.   When a glebe has once been designed, there seems tobe no further obligation or liability on  the heritors in connection therewith.  Glebes are held by no written  titles  and are allodialin  character.* See. Ecclesiastical Buildings and Glebes (Scotland) Act, 1868, 31      and 32 Viet., cap.  96, section 23, and Ecclesiastical Assess-      ments (Scotland) Act, 1900 , 63 and 64 Viet., cap. 20, section 4.
    The obligations on heritors in regard to glebes  have at the present day become substantially a matter of past history.   All parishes, it is thought,  entitled to a glebe have one, and it is unlikely that any further liability will fall on heritors either as to the provision or enlargement of glebes.   Consequently  this part of the Ecclesiastical Assessments is now of little or no value to the Church.    (3)  The last of the assessments are in respect of &quot;the designing &quot;or excambing of sites for additions to Churchyards, and the suit- &quot;able maintenance thereof  (including the building,  rebuilding, &quot;or repairing of churchyard walls).&quot;    The duty  of  providing,   maintaining,  and when  necessary enlarging, the churchyards  lies on the  heritors.   The  church- yard belongs to them  subject to the single burden of interring the dead.  All  parishioners, of whatever denomination, have a right to be buried therein.    The heritors have the management of the Churchyard, though they may devolve this duty to others, and in many cases the Kirk Session  have the actual management.    The heritors may,under Section 30 (6) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1894, transfer the property and management of the churchyard to  the Parish Council, who thereafter &quot;hold  the &quot;churchyard  for the  same purposes,  and  subject to the same &quot;rights  for and subject to which it was  held by such heritors.&quot; The  duty and expense of extending the Churchyard is, however, left upon the heritors.  Advantage has been taken of this section in  some  parishes  to  transfer  the churchyards to  the  Parish Councils.    The  Committee have  carefully  considered  the  present law concerning  the items in question, and think that in various ways it is unsatisfactory and capable of improvement.    They  think that  the  property in  all Churches  and  manses should  be in  the Church, and that the heritors should  have no rights therein.  As a natural corollary of  ownership  the expense of upkeep should devolve on  the Church.    The heritors  would thus  be relieved from assessments in respect of buildings, while the Church would gain by becoming the owners of such buildings.    A further advantage would accrue to the Church from such an arrangement.  At  present the   seats  in  Parish  Churches  are allocated amongst the heritors,  either by  agreement or judicially by  application  to  the civil  Court.   Though  in  recent years litigations  as  to the allocation of seats have been  rare, yet the jurisdiction of the Court remains, and such proceedings may at any time  be  raised.   This  undesirable  system   would naturally terminate by the transfer of  the property in the buildings to the Church.   As owners  of  the buildings  the Church authorities would have the right to allocate the seats in the way best adapted to congregational requirements,  and the heritors, as such, would lose their right to have seats allocated to them.   The Committee, while expressing no view as to the policy of imposing seat rents, think that the Church should have the powerto  levy  these  so  far as desired.  Any  proceeds from this source  might  form  a  fund to  replace  the  assessments  onheritors  for maintenance.   Such action  would  put  the  old
Parish Churches on substantially the same footing as the Churchesin quoad sacra parishes, Town Churches, and  the Churches  of most other Ecclesiastical bodies, in which, though on varying legalbases,  seat rents may be levied, and the resulting monies are insome cases spent on repairs.   As  above explained  the Committee think that the assessmentson heritors in regard to  Churches and manses should be abolished,as the natural consequence of the passing of the property in thebuildings to the Church.  The  Committee  are  prepared to  go further, and think that assessments  in  regard to  glebes, andassessments by heritors for churchyards, which are of little or no value,  to  the  Church,  should also be  abolished.   The whole system of. Ecclesiastical assessments  would thus disappear, andwith it a source of friction between the Church and the heritors.   The churchyard exists for the benefit of the whole  parish, andis in no way appropriated to the Church of Scotland.   The Com-mittee therefore think that the management thereof should be ina public parochial body, and not in the heritors or the Kirk Sessionas their delegates.  They think that the provisions of Section 30(6) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1894, should be madecompulsory, and the property and management of the Church-yards thus vested in the Parish Councils, on whom would also fallthe duty  of  enlarging  churchyards as required.   If this  wereenacted, the heritors as  a body would have no remaining functionsexcept in  cases where they had borrowed money repayable over a term of years.   Some  of  the archives  of  the  heritors may  be of historicalinterest,  and it would be well that there should be vested in theSecretary for Scotland power to direct these to be transmitted tothe General Eegister House at Edinburgh for preservation withother ancient records.  1 The Committee accordingly make the following recommenda-tions :-    (a) that the property in all Parish Churches and Manses in the       old parishes and their sites, in  so far as not  already the       property of the  Church, should be transferred from the       heritors to the Church  and  should be vested in the Church       of Scotland General Trustees;    (b) that the sole right to allocate seats in such Churches should       be vested in the  Church;   ic) that the Church  should have the power to levy seat rents in       such Churches,  and to  apply the proceeds either towards       repairs of the Church or otherwise, at the discretion of the       Church;   id) that Ecclesiastical  assessments on  heritors   should  be       abolished,  but that before such abolition the  heritors in       each parish should be under obligation to put the Churches       and manses, without undue delay, into a reasonable state of       tenantable  repair.   The  standard of tenantable  repair       should be such as may be  agreed on between  the heritors       and the presbytery concerned, but should not  in any case       involve structural alterations.    In the event  of disagree-       ment,   the question  should   be settled by summary
       application at  the instance of either party to the Sheriff,       whose decision should be final.    When  the repairs have       been executed, or if none are required, a Certificate signed       by the Presbytery or the Sheriff stating that the buildings       have been handed over by the heritors in a reasonable state       of tenantable repair should be sent to the  General Register       House, Edinburgh, for  preservation.   Moreover, before       Ecclesiastical assessments are abolished,  all obligations of       the  heritors,  including obligations  for repayment  of       borrowed  money, should be implemented, and on such       abolition  the Secretary for  Scotland should be  authorised       to make orders for.  preservation of documents of historical       interest;   (c) that the provisions  of Section 30  (6) of the Local Govern-       ment (Scotland) Act,  1894, applicable  to  churchyards,       should be made compulsory on  the  heritors  and  Parish       Councils.  In  cases  in  which Churches  are situated  in       churchyards, the transfer of churchyards should  be subject       to reasonable reservations, applicable to use, maintenance       and even possible enlargement of the Church fabric;   (/) that glebes should be the absolute property of the Church,       and vested in the Church of Scotland General Trustees.X. Parliamentary Charges  and  Other   Exchequer  Grants.,   These are Items A. II. and III. of the  Statement of Endow-ments given in Para. VI.   As regards the fabrics  of the forty-two  Churches and mansesin Parliamentary Charges, the Committee  assume that these would be transferred absolutely to the Church substantially,  asin the case of the old parish Churches and manses.   As regard Exchequer grants, the Committee recommend   that  negotiations  be opened  with  the Treasury  with  the-   general view of substituting for annual grants capital sums  in   the hands of the Church capable of producing  an income equal   to  the amount of the grants.  As the grants are payable under   Acts of Parliament, alteration may necessitate legislation.                   XI. Burgh  Churches.   These are Item A. IV. in the Statement of  Endowments  in para.  VI.*  They are town Churches, the  stipends  of  which are payable,  not out of teinds, but by Burghs  or from special fundsheld by Burghs for that  purpose.  The Ministers have,  as a rule,no right  to manse or glebe from the Burghs, but in many cases-manses have been provided by voluntary contributions.   The Churches are 46 in number, of which 6 are in Aberdeen,4 in Dundee, 14 in Edinburgh, 10 in Glasgow, 2 in Greenock, 1  inKilmarnock, 3 in Paisley,  3 in Perth, 1 in Queensferry, and 2  inStilling.   Be-arrangements  are in course of being made in con-nection with the Perth  Churches, but  the Committee  have not* A list of Burgh Churches is given in the Appendix.
been able to&apos;investigate the matter in detail.   They have dealt         ywith the Burgh Churches on consideration only of the principlesinvolved.    To  make  detailed  suggestions  would  necessitateprevious investigations  in  each Burgh concerned,  which  wouldhave been impossible for this Committee.   In each of these towus the history of the Churches is different,and  in  many cases obscure and  uncertain.   There is howeverreason for  believing that in many cases  the Burghs  originallyundertook their obligations in regard to these Churches  in returnfor Church property of  one kind or  another  which  they  had acquired.   Thus  in Dundee, by  a Royal  Charter of 1567, MaryQueen of Scots  disponed to the Burgh certain  Church propertyfor,  inter alia, the sustentation of the  Ministers serving the cureof the Burgh.   The present positions of the Churches  vary no less than theirhistories. In Glasgow the stipends are payable out of the CommonGood Bund of the  City, into which the seat rents &apos; of  the  CityChurches are paid.   In Edinburgh an entirely different, and, inthe opinion of the Committee  a preferable  state  of  affairs  isfound.                          ,  ..   ;              ,   In Edinburgh prior  to 1860 the maintenance of the ministers of the City  Churches was provided by an Annuity Tax on eachhouseholder in the Burgh.  The collection of  the tax was. resentedand  in some cases led to riots.  In 1860 the  system was changedby Act of Parliament,* the administration  and custody of the CityChurches being transferred from -the  Magistrates to  a  newly-constituted  body called the Edinburgh  Ecclesiastical  Commis-sioners.  The  annuity   tax  was abolished  and  the  financial obligations of the Burgh were commuted by payment of a capital sum to the Commissioners by the Burgh. The Commissioners havethus replaced the Burgh as administrators of the Churches.   Theirpresent capital funds are about  100,000, and  their income, outof which the stipends are paid and the Churches kept in repair,is derived mainly from interest  on capital  and from the seat  rentsof the Churches.   The scheme created by Act of Parliament for Edinburgh hasin practice proved  fairly satisfactory,  and the  Committee thinkthat it affords valuable guidance for the solution of the problem ofall the Burgh Churches.  It is  not possible for  the Committee to frame a.detailed scheme dealing with this  question.  They share the view held, they  believe, by the Church of Scotland, that theappointment of a Commission  with  executive  powers  will  benecessary  to  dispose  finally  of  this  question.   The   com-complexity  of the subject and the necessity for local enquiry, render it impossible for the Committee to do more than indicate thegeneral lines on which such a Commission should act.   The Commission would enquire into the circumstances in thevarious Burghs in which Burgh Churches are  situated, and would,in concert with the  Church and each Burgh  concerned, adjust ascheme, the general effect of which would be to transfer to the*  See Annuity Tax Abolition (Edinburgh) Act,  23 and 24 Viet., cap.      50, as amended in 1870 By Act 33 and 34 Viet., cap. 87.
Church the property in the fabrics and sites of the Churches andall existing manses, as well as all sums of money or other property held by the Burgh for Church purposes.    The  functions and property of the Edinburgh Ecclesiastical  Commissioners  should perhaps  be  transferred to the  body holding the  other  BurghChurches on behalf of the Church.  An  equitable arrangement asto obligations by Burghs to pay  stipend irrespective of particularmortified funds should be attainable.  The Church, as owner ofthe buildings, would relieve the  Burghs of all obligations for themaintenance and management of the Churches.  In each case thescheme would, no doubt, require to be adapted to local variations in  circumstances,  but  the  Committee  do  not regard  exactuniformity as material, provided  that certain requirements,  which appear essential to the satisfactory solution of the question, areobserved. These are :    (1) that property held by Burghs specifically for the purposes of       the Church  of  Scotland should  be  transferred to  the       Church;    (2) that  annual payments by  Burghs should be commuted       either by payment of capital sums or by the  creation of       terminable annuities with sinking fund accumulations;    (3) that the property in the fabrics and sites of the Churches       and manses should be vested in the Church, which should       thenceforth  undertake the obligation of upkeep;    (4) that in each case the life interest of present incumbents be       preserved, with a power  to  parties, as in the  case of the       old parishes, to accelerate by agreement  the introduction       of the  new  system.    As the  incumbents  of  Burgh       Churches are not affected by the variations in fiars prices,       an equitable arrangement ought in these cases to be the       more readily attainable.                XII. Executive Commission.   The Committee think  that, as the proposed  Executive  Com-mission will be concerned with questions of property,  and largelywith  questions  between the Church on  the one  part and partiesoutside the Church  on the other,  its members should be appointedby Government.  They suggest that it should consist of not morethan  five members, and that the Chairman should  have judicialexperience.   The functions of such a Commission would be to  investigateand decide all questions relating to the endowments of  the Churchas to  which special enquiries of a local or  detailed character were required.  Some such questions  can be foreseen  and are referredto below; but in a matter so complex it must be anticipated that other questions of a like nature will emerge for solution, and it isdesirable that the powers of the Executive Commission should bewide  enough to cover such points as they arise.   The Committee desire to refer  to the  following questions inwhich the intervention  of  an  Executive Commission  will  benecessary.
    (1) BURGH CHURCHES AND RELATIVE PROPERTY. These have       been dealt with in Para. XI.                      .,   , &apos;    (2) LANDWARD BURGHAL PARISHES. Not a few old parishes       partake partly of the nature of rural parishes and partly       of Burgh Churches.  It is probable that special circum-       stances exist in some of these as to which local enquiry and       arrangements  of  a  special kind will be required.   There       are also a few other Churches in an exceptional position,       and with these the Commission should have power to deal.    (3) VICARAGE TEINDS. These belonged to the Vicar, and con-       sisted of certain fruits of  an  unusual  kind  not included       under   Parsonage  Teinds, as, for  example, fish, calves,       lambs and wool.  They are now due only when there has       been habitual payment for forty years, and in most parishes       have been lost by desuetude.   Where paid at all they are       not  now  paid  in kind, but  are converted into money       according to use  and  wont.   In the cases in which such       teinds  are still payable, the  Committee think that their       value ought to be ascertained  and  a  scheme for  their       extinction devised on the same  general lines  as apply to       ordinary or parsonage  teinds.  This  will  involve  local       enquiries in which the services of an Executive Commission       will be essential.    (4)&apos; ANCIENT MONUMENTS. Certain Ecclesiastical buildings are       wholly or partly of the nature of &quot;Ancient Monuments,&quot;       calling for special precautions for preservation on account       of architectural and other features,  and it may be neces-       sary  to regulate their future administration accordingly in       the interests of all concerned.    (5) In the case  of communion plate and other ecclesiastical       furnishings,  in which any public body claims an interest,       the Commission  should  be  empowered to make orders       transferring  these to the Kirk Session of the congregation       to whose use they are already devoted.               . .    (6) If  there be any cases  in which the heritors had not fully       implemented the obligation to provide a glebe, or in which       the Minister had  accepted an annual payment in place of       glebe,  the Commission should  be  empowered to  make       orders  equitably  clearing  up  matters   as between  the       Church and the heritors.        XIII. Endowments  from  Voluntary   Sources.    These  are&apos;  the  items  included   under  B.   and   C.  ofthe Statement of Endowments  in  para. VI.  It may well bethat,   in    the   event   of   negotiations   for  union    with another   Church  being   entered   upon   by   the   Church  ofScotland, a  readjustment of the  conditions under which certain of  these  endowments are administered  will  prove  necessary.They are, speaking  generally, in a position  similar to the endow-ments or property of other Churches, in that they are the produce of donations or legacies,  or are  derived from  other voluntarysources.   They  are  less  directly  within  the  scope  of  the
Remit to this Committee, who therefore do not feel bound, withreference to such properties generally, to make recommendations.The Committee, however,  mention very generally certain classes;of voluntarily-raised property, to which attention may have to bedirected in the event of union.    (a) Endowments of quoad sacra parishes. This property is inthe position of being the product of voluntary effort, but is underthe judicial supervision of the Teind Court.  The Committee refer to what is  suggested hereafter in this Report regarding the TeindCourt.    (b) Ministers&apos; Widows  Eund. This  fund, in substance  theresult of Ministers&apos; contributions, is regulated by  Statute.    TheUnited Free Church has a  corresponding fund  also regulated by statute.   But the conditions of  the two do not correspond,  andas above mentioned, that of the Church of Scotland include a legalright to  the  proceeds  of vacant stipends.   it would seem  to be appropriate that  there be carefully considered by the Churches,in view of  union, how  the respective funds would be situated,  and how they would operate in the  event  of union unless the matterbe  regulated by appropriate concurrent legislation.   This seemsto be the  more appropriate, seeing that the contributors  to  the funds are not limited  absolutely  to Ministers of congregations&apos;ofthe respective Churches; for example the Principals and Professorsof the four Scottish Universities are contributors to the Church ofScotland Widows Fund.    (c) The Church of  Scotland, like other Churches, is interestedin outside trusts, such as the Ferguson Bequest Trust, and itwould seem appropriate that there be enquiry, in connection withunion, as to  the effect of union as regards the uniting Churches&apos;interests in such trusts.                      XIV.-Teind  Court.    The proposals for the entire abolition of teinds, by commutationand redemption,  compel the Committee to consider the positionof the Court or Commission of Teinds on the assumption that those proposals receive legislative effect.   If the Court were to existthereafter  under that name it would be a misnomer.    The  substantial  question is  what  functions the  Court would serve after abolition of teinds and augmentations of  stipends.   Itwould still be a  Court for erection of quoad sacra  parishes, forunion and disjunction  of parishes, transportation of Churches,  and similar matters.    But  amongst the  Committee&apos;s proposals  areincluded  the recommendation   that  all Churches, manses,  andglebes not now the property of the Church be transferred to theChurch, and that no outside body, such as the heritors, should haverights or obligations in  reference to them.   In  these  circum-stances, it seems to the Committee that after abolition  of teindsthere will  be no real need for the continued  existence of the court or  Commission of  Teinds.   Its  powers  as  to Churches, manses,and glebes (including  prices received for glebes sold), ought to betransferred to the General Assembly, and the Court of Teinds itselfought to be abolished, due provision being made for  custody of its archives and for other matters arising on its dissolution.
    The Committee therefore recommend :     (a) that the powers of the Teind Court applicable to Churches,       manses  and glebes, and  to disjunction  and  union of       parishes, be transferred to the Church as soon as may be,       and    (b) that as soon as all the old parishes in Scotland have been       put on the new system as regards teinds, the Teind Court       be wound up and dissolved.                    XV. Ann or  Annat.    Ann is a half year&apos;s stipend due to the executors of a minister in  addition to  the stipend vested in  him.  It is  payable only if the Minister die during  his incumbency.    It  is  in  effect  aprovision for  the widow and children or next  of kin of a minister so dying.   The Committee would point out that, in the event of union, Ann would require  to be either abolished or extended soas to apply in the case of all Ministers of a United Church.  Anyother course  would be productive of confusion.  The Committeeassume  that  in this, as in other cases, existing rights would be respected.  But the right is anomalous, and  if it were abolished and the stipends when vacant paid to the Widows Fund as atpresent,  there  would be  no  substantial  variation  of  purposeresulting from the abolition of the Ann the whole amount would fall into the general fund for Widows of Ministers.     XVI. Assets of the United Free Church of Scotland.    By the  kindness of the Law Agent of the United Free church of Scotland,  the Committee have been  provided with informationas to the property of that Church.    They asked the members ofthe United Free Church with whom they conferred, whether-therewere any points with reference to the property of that Church asto which legislation was necessary for setting  free the assets witha view to union.   The reply received was to the effect that, afterconsultation with the Conveners&apos; Committee,  it was impossible tosay at the present stage, and until the question of an incorporatingunion between  the  Churches  was  being dealt  with,  whether any such points would arise; and that the question  had  not been before the Committee for Conference with the  Church of Scotland,nor before  the Assembly  of the United Free Church.  The Com-mittee has  no reason, to think that it is one over which difficulty islikely to arise,  and it is  not specifically within the terms of theRemit to them.  In the event of negotiations being entered upon for  union between the Church  of Scotland and the United FreeChurch, it will in the view of the Committee be for those Churchesrespectively to consider whether they have occasion to approachParliament with a request  for legislation beyond what the Com-mittee has  recommended.   The Churches alone appear to have adirect interest  in  such possible  legislation.  The  committee therefore  make  no  suggestions  as to  legislation  in  regardto the property of the  United Free  Church  of Scotland,  butcontent  themselves with referring to what is said above regardingthe property  of  the Church of Scotland derived from voluntary
effort.   Some  of the observations of the Committee there mademay be applicable to property  belonging to  the  United  PreeChurch, or in which that Church may be interested.                           XVII.   The Committee have now completed the recommendations they wish to make under the Remit to them.   They   are   of   opinion    that    the   recommendations which  they have made  should  be  embodied  in  a  Bill  and passed into law as soon as possible.  The proposed  Bill should contain a clause in the usual terms declaring its enactments to be applicable to the Crown and Crown property.           XVIII. Summary  of  Recommendations.   The recommendations made by  the Committee are not givenin detail in  this paragraph,  as  to  do  so would  involve muchrepetition.  No more  is attempted than to give in concise form  asummary of the principal recommendations with  references to the passages in the Report where they are to be found in detail.    (1)  SCHEME  FOR DEALING WITH TEINDS  (pp.  12 et seq.).    The general object is  to abolish the  whole system of teinds,including the system by which  stipend, varying  annually  in amount, is paid therefrom by the owners of land  to the Ministers;and to substitute therefor a system under which the land ownerswill redeem the burden  of teind, and the Ministers will receivestipends,  fixed in  amount, from  a purely  Ecclesiastical body(p. 12).    The  provisions by which this object  is  attained are  asfollows :  &quot;   (a) The life interests of existing  incumbents  are  respected (p. 12).    (b) Provision is made for the conversion of victual stipend into a  fixed and  permanent money  value, on the  basis of average value  over a period of fifty years up to  and including 1922 (p, 13).    (a) The new  system  is  to be introduced in  the particular parishes at varying times, and under varying conditions, according to the circumstances  of different parishes (pp. 14 and 15).    (d) In future only a single and final application for augmenta- tion of stipend is to be competent  in any parish.  Compensation for future augmentations rendered incompetent is provided,  and other provisions  are made as to the conditions under which such final applications may be brought (pp.  16 and 17).    (e) It is suggested that Ministers be relieved by the Church  of the expenses of  final  applications for  augmentations  of stipend (p. 18).    (/) Provision is made for the compulsory redemption, of the stipend payable by heritors, either by single payment or by pay- ments.spread over a number of years.   Detailed  recommendations are made as to the conditions under which such redemption should be effected (pp. 19 and 20).
   (g) Provision is made  for Ecclesiastical Commissioners  ortrustees to  hold and administer  on behalf of-the. Church themonies paid by heritors for the redemption of stipend  (pp. 21 and,22).   &quot;      &apos;   The Commissioners  or trustees would  pay  stipends direct  to ministers, whose claim against the heritors for  stipend would  be abolished (p. 20).   (h) Provision is made for the  compulsory redemption of freeteind by all heritors who do not own the  teinds of  their  lands(p. 23).   (i)  A Teind Roll for every parish is to  be prepared specifyingin money    (1) the total teind of the parish;   (2) the amount of that  total  applicable to  the  lands of each       heritor;                                  ...   (3) (the value of the whole stipend payable;   (4) the  proportion  of  that  value payable  by each  heritor       (p. 24).   Time limits  are set  on the exercise of the rights to apply forvaluation of unvalued teinds, and to  surrender valued teinds.   Bythese provisions the money values in  the Teind Rolls in due coursebecome final and binding on all concerned (p. 25).   The basis on which teinds are to be converted  into money is defined (p. 25).   (7c) The existing method of obtaining a valuation of teinds isproposed  to be  abolished, and a cheaper  and simpler methodsubstituted by means of application to the Sheriff (pp; 25 and 26).   (0  The proposals as to the method of surrender of valued teindscontained in the Teinds Bill, 1920, are adopted so far as consistent with the recommendations in the Report (p. 26).   (m) Provision is made  that under the  new system stipendshould, vest in Ministers de die diem  (p. 27).(2)  PROVISIONS AS TO  CHURCHES,  MANSES, GLEBES, CHUBCH-    YARDS AND  ECCLESIASTICAL  ASSESSMENTS (pp. 28, etc.).   (a) The  property in all Parish Churches, Manses  and Glebesto be vested in General Trustees (pp. 31 and 32).   (b) The sole right to allocate seats in Parish Churches to  be vested in the Church (p. 31).   (c) Ecclesiastical  assessments  on  heritors   to  be abolished,subject to an obligation on  heritors  to put, Churches  and mansesinto a reasonable state of tenantable repair before being relieved ofthe burden of maintenance and repair (pp. 31 and 32).   (d) Provision is made for the transfer of the property in, and management of, churchyards to the  Parish Councils (p. 32.  see also  p. 30).   (3) RECOMMENDATION AS  TO ANNUAL EXCHEQUER  GRANTS.   It is suggested that  negotiations  be opened with the Treasurywith the view of substituting for annual grants capital sums in thehands of the Church (p. 32).  &apos;
   (4)  RECOMMENDATION  AS  TO  EXECUTIVE  COMMISSION.   It is proposed that a Commission  with executive powers beappointed to enquire into and determine questions in which local or detailed enquiry is necessary (p. 33).   Examples of such questions are   (1) Burgh Churches (p. 34.  See also pp. 32 to 34).   (2) Landward-Burgbal Parishes (p. 34).   (3) Vicarage Teinds (p. 33).   (4) Ancient Monuments  (p.  35).   (5) Observations are also made regarding :        (a) The  endowments of quoad sacra parishes (p. 35).       (b) The  Ministers&apos; Widows Fund (p. 36).       (c) Trusts in which the Church is interested (p. 36)..       (d) The  Court of Teinds (pp. 36 and 37).       (e) Ann  (p. 37).       (/) The  assets of  the United  Free Church of  Scotland          (p. 37).   (6) Finally,  the Committee recommend that the recommenda-tions which they make should be embodied in a  Bill and passed into law as soon as possible (p. 38).                           XIX.   In conclusion, the Committee wish to state that  they  are greatly indebted to their  Secretary, Mr. Alexander Maitland ofthe Scottish Bar, for very real assistance rendered to them through-out their work.   They have been fortunate in having his services at their disposal.  For he has brought  to his task, not only a keeninterest in the subject and a wide knowledge of the law involved,but  tact  and care combined with a marked power of getting on with men.         We are, My Lord,               Your obedient servants,                     HALDANE  OF CLOAN,  Chairman.                     .MACLAY OF  GLASGOW.                     JAMES   M.
