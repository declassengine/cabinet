7  7CfimDOCUMENT.PflOPEBgjY OF .JLXS BEITAMIO, MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.      It  la  essential  that  tho  Cabinet  should arriveat a  decision as  to the future of  the  temporary provisionsof Part  II  of the Safeguarding of  Industries Act before weseparate,   A situation has arisen whioh makes it imperativefor the  Board of Trade to  take a definite line and togive  a deoislon in a  number of oases.  The attached memorandum  sets out the position.  To  delay further isadministratively impossible and politically undesirable.      I am definitely  of opinion that tho exchange provisionsof the Act  should not be continued beyond the present statutory limit,   I have  always held the view that if an industry is to receive protection  at all, the only feasiblemethod is by means of a duty applied to imports from all sources.  The administrative difficulties of discriminatingagainst  importB for particular oountries are familiar to all who have attempted the task.   The  Treaty difficulties are set out  in  the attached Memorandum.      So long as Germany was the only exporting country inwhich an exchange bounty operated, it waB possible to Justifyand to work the exchange provisions of the Act, though themaohinery was cumbrous and troublesome.   But the position has changed.   There is littlo doubt that such a bountyexists to-day in Prance, Belgiur.  and Italy,  but we areprecluded by treaty from imposing  a discriminating duty againstBelgium or Italy) and if we attempted to do  so against Pranoe,Secret.CABINET.CP. 355 (S3).SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES ACT.Memo by the President of the Board of Trade.
while leaving other oountries free, I think it is oertainthat she would retaliate against us.   A general duty,however, on any particular artiole is no broach of anyTreaty,     I suggest, therefore, that we should deoide not to renew the exchange provisions of the act, while reservingfull power to impose a general duty in the case of any industry where the unemployment due to foreign competitionis so serious aB to call for speoial treatment.  Unemploymentimmediate and prospective is so extensive that I think weshould be fully justified in thlB action.   We have already referred the lace and silk industries to a Committee with ageneral reference.  Recent outs in prices will I fearundoubtedly cause a great reduction of employment in thetyro industry.   Woollen &amp; Worsted tissues are sufferingseverely from French competition.   At the same time freshsouroes of revenue are required to meet the cost of unemploymentrelief measures.    If the policy I have proposed is accepted, I should refuoeto entertain any further applications under the Safeguarding ofIndustries Act.   At the same time I should propose that theBoard of Trade should accept the responsibility of investigating the conditions of industrios which complained that their employment was being seriously  and abnormally affected by foreign imports.   If the Board wore satisfied as to the facts of the case, the efficiency of the industry,  and the  generaladvantage of imposing a duty, they should recommend theChanoellor of the Exchequer to take action aooordingly*  Inthe term     &apos;goneral advantage&apos; I  include the considerationof the effect of a duty on any industry which UBOS the product of the industry in question in its own manufacture.
     The Silk and Lace Committee will report before theHouse reassembles, and it would be possible for theBoard of Trade to give an opinion on the few ether cases that.press&apos;at present within the same period.P.L1.-G.  27.7.23.
          SAFEGUARDING Off INDUSTRIES ACT.Expiry of Section 2 (1) (b) - Import duties on goods      from countries with depreciated exchange.     1. It is urgently necessary to have a decision as to thefuture of Seotion 2 (1) (b) of the Safeguarding of industries act.  That Seotion empowers the Board of Trade, after certain conditions are fulfilled, to issue Orders imposing an ad valorem duty of 33ty3$ on specified olasses of goods ooming fromspecified countries, in oases where employment in any industryin the United Kingdom is being, or is likely to be, seriously affected by the importation of suoh goods at prices whioh,owing to the depreciation of the currency of the oountriesin question, are below the prices at whioh similar goods canbe profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom.  By Seotion of the Act, however, no suoh Order can be made or continue inforoe after 19th August, 1924,   A number of applications fororders are being held up until a decision on the general position has been obtained.2     2, The prooedure under the Act is to appoint a Committeeto deal with each oomplaint reoeived after the Board of trade have satisfied themselves that a prima facie case exists forreferring the oomplaint to a Committee.   As the enquiriesinvolved both on the part of the Board and of the committees are difficult, a considerable interval inevitably elapsesbetween the reoeipt of a complaint and the reoeipt of theCommittee^ Report upon it.    Hence even if Committees oould beappointed forthwith regarding the outstanding complaints, itis probable that, having regard specially to the fact that the holiday seaBon is approaching, the reports of the Committeesoould not be obtained before the Autumn and they would thenrequire careful consideration.  If it were proposed to make orders, these would have to go before Parliament arid await anopportunity of disoussion.  At the best, therefore,  any orderswhioh might be made regarding the outstanding complaints wouldhave much less than 12 months to run, and this argumentnaturally applies still more strongly to any complaints whiahmay be received hereafter.     The usual result of referring a complaint to a Committee isthat the importers of the goods affected immediately bringlarge quantities into this country in order to have large stooksin the event of a protective duty being imposed.    Such in-creased Importations would probably more than outweigh any advantage which the industries concerned oould derive from suchprotective duties, extending as these would for so short aperiod.   On balance, therefore,  the result of referring aoomplaint to a Committee in present circumstances might be definitely detrimental to the industry oonoerned.   For these reasons it would be inadvisable to refer complaints  to Committeesunder the Act, unless it is  definitely decided to continue theAct after August next.-4-The powers under Seotion 2 (1) (a)  of  the Act to  deal with &quot;dumping&quot; (sale below the foreign cost of production,  as defined) are not subject to any time  limit.
      3.   The  occupation of the Ruhr and the disturbed conditions  of Germany generally add very  considerably to the  difficulties  of the situation.    The rapid depreciation of the German exchange  has, no doubt, given an advantage to German exports  in the past, but if an eoonomio collapse of Germany  should occur, it would be impossible for Germany to continue exporting on even her present scale, and there would be  little further need for the Aot, so far aa ooncerns that oountry.  In the  meantime, until the situation is clearer,  any  Committee  to which a complaint was referred (particularly if  the  complaint were based rather on prospeo- tlve than on  aotual unemployment in this country) would clearly have  a very difficult task to perform.    The Board of Trade  have already postponed referring certain oomplaints to Committees on  the  ground of the uncertainty of the position  in Germany,  but so long as German Imports continue to come in  at suoh &apos;low prioes as to under-sell the products of British  manufacturers, this attitude on the part of the Department  is an unsatisfactory one and strong pressure oontinues and will continue to be applied with a view to having Committees  set up.      4.   Up  to the present no oomplaint of under-selling by reason of the depreciation of any foreign exchange except that of Germany (and  in two instances Czechoslovakia)  has been referred to a  Committee.    The cases now outstanding, however,  include complaints against Pranoe,  Belgium, Italy, czecho-Slovakia and Austria,   It is probable that at present the  relation  between the foreign exohange value and the internal  purchasing power of Czeoho-Slcvakian and Austrian currency  is not such as to establish a bounty on exports, and  in that case (apart from any other consideration) the conditions  required by  the Act for the making of an Order would not be  fulfilled.    In the oase of Prance,  Belgium and Italy, however, it  seems probable that the reoent movement of the exchanges has resulted in a bounty on exports and if, as a  result of ooourrenoes in Germany,  the French and Belgian exchanges were to undergo further rapid deterioration,  exports from those  countries would no doubt be stimulated to a considerable  extent.  Hence the volume of complaints against under-selling of British by foreign goods seems likely  to extend.  This will mean further pressure on the Government to oome to  the help of  the industries affeoted.      5*   The position  is further complicated by Treaty difficulties, as the Act provides that  no Order oan be  madewhioh is  at variance with any Treaty Convention or engage- ment  with any foreign state in force for the  time  being.We have a Treaty with Italy and an agreement  with  Belgiumwhioh preclude us from  issuing Orders imposing duties on Belgian or  Italian goods.    Hence,  if a complaint in respect of Belgian  or Italian goods were established,  it would  be neoessary before making an Order to terminate  the  Agreement or the Treaty as the case might be.     The arrangement  with Belgium oan be terminated at 3 months&apos;  notioe  and  the treaty with  Italy at 12 months&apos; notioe.  In the latter oase  the  Treaty oould not be  terminated before the  expiry of  the Aot;  and the termination of the Belgian arrangement  in order to give protection for so short a period would obviously be  most inexpedient.   There is  no Oommeroial Treaty with  Franoe,  but Pranoe at present gives  us  most-favoured-nation treatment,  and there would be a grave danger of losing  this treatment  if we made:5r
an Order applicable to French goods.   There are political considerations also to be taken into account.     6. The possible alternative courses include thefollowings-        (a) To introduce legislation extending the relevant            provisions of the Safeguarding of Industries            Act beyond August next.        (b) To allow those provisions to expire, In August            next, and for the reasons set out above to make            no further references to Committees under the Act.        (c) Whilst adopting this second course (b) to provide            for some other investigation of complaints, with            a view to determining whether action other than            that provided by the Safeguarding of Industries            Act can advantageously be taken.   (This course            has in faot already been adopted in respect of            Silk goods, Lace and Embroidery).     The adoption of the first course would require a short,but very controversial Bill.   It would involve the definitedeoision as to denouncing our commercial treaties with belgium and Italy, and the still mere difficult question of discrimina-ting against Franoe.   In the meantime the Board of Trade wouldbe forced to refer inquiries to Committees without being ableto declare whether orders would be made after the Committeeshad reported.   The second course is simple;  but if unaccom-panied by any declaration of policy as to the possibility of imposing &quot;McKenna duties&quot;,  it affords no relief to any industryhowever seriously afflicted.     In all the circumstances the third course Indicated above would appear to offer the best solution of the immediate problem.   Provided the Industry is efficiently conducted, theonly action possible is to Include it under the McKenna duties.If the third course is to be followed, the question arises whether the investigations suggested should be made by theBoard of Trade themselves,  or by a Committee or Committees(following the Silk and Lace precedent).   It would of course be desirable for some indication to be given In advance of thekind of conditions which would make an industry eligible forassistance of this kind.     7. A list of the complaints already dealt with isgiven in Appendix I, and a list of the outstanding complaints,together with notes on the  position of each, is given inAppendix II.
          APPENDIX I.Complaints referred, to Committees.     The 15 complaints referred to Committees havebeen dealt with as follows     Four (Fabric Gloves, Glassware, Aluminium Hollow-           ware and Wrought Enamelled Hollow-ware) were           the subject of the Order made by the Board           of Trade on the 8th August, 1922;     One  (Gas Mantles) was the subject of the Seoond           Order made on the 9th October, 1922 5           By these Orders, an ad valorem duty of 33 /$%           was imposed on imported goods of the           descriptions specified if manufactured in           Germany.   These duties will, under existing           provisions, terminate in August, 1924;     Mine, (Gold Leaf?  Plain and Enamelled Baths;  Toys;           Bronze Powders;  Wire Nails;  Snap Fasteners           and Hooks and Eyes.*  Glass Bottles (2  (l)(a)*           Holland);  Glass Bottles (2 (l)(b)K Germany);           Vulcanized Fibre (2) (l)(a)s United States);           were adversely reported upon by Committees;    . One   (Optical and other Scientific Instruments) was           reported upon favourably only as regards certain           comparatively unimportant classes of instruments,           and the Board of Trade decided to make no Order.* The complaints marked &quot;2 (l)(a)K did not relate to underselling     by reason of depreciation of foreign currency (2(l)(b) ), but     to selling below the (foreign) cost of production.
           APPENDIX II.Outstanding complaints and; applications     The following list shows the applications nowoutstanding together with the oountries to whioh they relate.        A^Definlte Complaints regarding whioh full           details have been furnished by the           applicants.     jl) Machine Tools...............Germany (^,T.C.101&amp;).     (2) Chrome Calf Upper Leather.Germany (B^C.1019).     (3) Rolled Gold, Gilt and                    X          Imitation Jewellery.......,Germany (B.T;&quot;cioi4).

Definite applications for  Orders,  regarding            which fulidetalls have not yet  been            furnished.     (6) Woollen and Worsted         Tissues....................Fran oe.     (7) Felt  Hats...................Italy,  Austria,  Germany,                                      Czecho-Slovakia  and                                      France.         Tapestry Table Severs.Belgium and France.         Wrapping Paper..............Gawnany.IS!     In the first three cases the applicants have beeninformed that a definite decision as to reference to aCommittee has been deferred until the German situation becomesclearer.  The fourth case has been referred to the Silk and Lace Committee generally, and not specifically as a complaintunder the Safeguarding of Industries Act.                      Other Complaints.     In addition to the above mentioned complaints a numberof other complaints have been dealt with and are still out-standing, in the sense that they have been neither rejectednor withdrawn, though in nearly every oas*j a considerable time has elapsed sinoe any correspondence took place.  Thesecomplaints relate inter alia to artificial flowers,microsoopes,buttons, magnetos, eleotrio batteries, radiators,and rubber tyres.  In each case some further information was required before the Board of Trade could decide whether aprlma facie oase had been established and the associations,whioh lodged the complaints, were asked to furnish this information, but have not yet done so.  The ease of buttonshas, however, been recently brought forward again through a letter from one of the button manufacturing firms.   Themost, important of the cases In this section is probably thatof rubber tyres.  The manufacturers have riot yet furnishedthe Board of Trade with all the information required by theDepartment, but they are now and have for some tijme beenconducting a strong campaign in favour of the 33f3$ motor-car duty being extended to tyres and this campaign hasreceived new strength owing to the reoent reduction in prices by a French fiim which sends its tyres into this oountry.
