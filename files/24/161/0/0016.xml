THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                      CABINET.              COMPENSATION (IRISH FREE STATE).      Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to  the Treasury.     The Memorandum of the Secretary  of State for theColonies (CP. 306 (S3) )  raises important  financial considerations and I- desire to submit to the Cabinet thefollowing observations upon the issues involved in this difficult matter,     The Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum deals  with two subjects which stand upon a different footing.     (1)  Pre-Truce Compensationj and     (2)  Post-Truce Compensation.1,   For Pre-Truce Compensation the two governments have accepted a joint responsibility, and it should beremembered that the existing arrangements are based upon an agreement reached between British and Irish  ministers immediately after the Treaty, supplemented by a furtheragreement made between Mr, Cosgrave and the then FinancialSecretary to the Treasury (Major Hills) at  the  financial conference of February last.   I am sure that it willbe agreed that any action involving a material  change inthese arrangements ought only to be taken as the resultof agreement between the two Governments af,ter  full discussion of the difficulties involved.     A3 regards the working of these  arrangementsI can find no evidence that any delays which havehitherto arisen have been caused by financial stringencyon the side of the Free State Government,   The delayCP. 516 (23).
seems to be due partly to legal difficulties which                                                         141have now been removed by the recent Pree State Act, partly to the necessity of ascertaining whether the holder of an award has mortgaged it to some other person, to whom, and -&quot;not to the original holder, payment must then be made, and&apos; -to some extent, no doubt, to inadequacy or inexperience ofstaff.     I understand from the Secretary of State1a memorandum that it Is hoped that&apos; the&apos; Free State Government will be ableto accelerate the payment of food Renton awards ,to an extentsufficient to remove all grounds of complaint and that, unlessthat hope is disappointed, it will be unnecessary to suggest any alteration of the existing system.   Of the four methodssuggested on pages, 3.and 4 as alternatives to the present&apos;arrangements,- the first three would probably cause more ratherthan less delay, apart from the financial objections to whichthey are open,  ,     The first,-that the settlement between the two governments should be made weekly or even daily, would be of no advantagebut very troublesome to the two Treasuries.   If the Free StateGovernment, really find themselves short of cash, a bettersolution would be to make payments on account of our share  ofthe liabilities in advance, but in view of the arrangements which the Free State Government are understood to have made forborrowing on Treasury Bills during the next few months this method appears to be unnecessary.     The second suggestion, that the British Government shouldmake all payments in the first Instance, and should subsequentlyrecover the Irish proportion from the Free State Government,  isin my opinion strongly to be deprecated, because, in view of  theamounts which the Pree State Government already owe to theBritish Exchequer, it is most undesirable that the balance  oftheir Indebtedness should be further swelled.   Moreover theBritish Government could not pay In all cases without consulting the Pree State Government, who are naturally most anxious thatpayments should not be made to Irregulars.
   Tbe third suggestion; that the Wood Renton Commission shouldItself make payments, was fully discussed at the Conference ofFebruary last  and rejected.    The Commission has no machinery.for such a purpose,  and it again would have to eonsult both the responsible Governments before making payment&quot; in any case.     The fourth suggestion,  that the Irish Grants Committeeshould make advances to Loyalists up to the full amount of the awards held by them, is perhaps less open to objection but I fear that it may involve  serious  difficulties.   It is clearly Imposs-ible to devise any precise definition of the term &quot;Loyalist&quot; inthis connection.   I gather  that, although payments would not be confined to persons  now resident in this country, the Irish GrantsCommittee do not  anticipate difficulty in distinguishing propercases, but in  view of the strong inducement involved, I do not feelconfident that such  difficulties would not arise in future.Further It would be  obviously necessary, before making payment,to consult the Free  State Government In order to avoid duplicationof payment and to ascertain that the holder of an award has notmortgaged it in part or in full;  and apart from the delay involved,.if those formalities are fulfilled, there would seem no reason-whyat that stage  payment should not be made by the Free State Govern-ment Itself.   Moreover I understand that, although the totalultimate liability of the British Exchequer would not be increased,the suggested  arrangement might increase that liability in thecurrent year and so  involve a Supplementary Estimate of possibly 750,000 in the Autumn, upon which a full discussion of the whole subject in the House of Commons would be inevitable.   In thesecircumstances  I ask  the Cabinet not to endorse the suggestedarrangement until the Under Secretary for the Colonies has had anopportunity during his visit to Dublin of discussing the whole matter with Mr. Cosgrave and it is clear that no other more satisfactory solution can be found.2o   On the subject  of Post-Truce Compensation theattention of the Cabinet should be drawn to the reply dated                            -3-                             /10th
10th August 1922 sent by the Provisional Government to theBritish Government letter of 6th July 1922, and circulatedto the Committee on Irish Affairs as I,T,0.60 (Revise).Para.9 of this letter, which was an amended version of a replypreviously sent and was not, I have ascertained, withdrawn, as was suggested during the recent discussion of the matter at theCabinet, refers to the question of Poat-Trube Compensation asfollows:-        &quot;I have to submit that this problem is one wholly   within the province of the Provisional Government, but at   the same time I am to inform you that the problem has been   receiving much and anxious consideration on the part of the   Provisional Government.   The Provisional Government have   in fact, appointed a committee to consider the matter in   all its aspects and to advise how it ia to be dealt with   aa soon as the Government&apos;s hands are free enough to allow   them to take up and solve the matter.   It is wholly   in the interests of the Provisional Government to deal with   it on a satisfactory basis - on such a basis as will   restore confidence and stability In this country&quot;.       In pursuance of this policy the Free State Governmenthave now passed into law.their Damage to Property (Compensation)Bill and I understand that the British Government did not &apos;think it necessary to make any representations on the subjectof the Bill during its passage,   Very strong reasons aretherefore obviously required to justify a request for there-opening of this&apos; stage of the terms of an Act which has only just received the aasent of the Governor General onbehalf of the Crown.        It is-,now bowser suggested that the reoent FreeState Act ia open to criticism on the following points:-        (a)   That it provides for part payment ofcompensation in Bonds,  -
        Seeing that the British Government has since 1909paid Irish landowners for their land in paper, and proposedin 1920 to purchase all the remaining land in Ireland   icompulsorily on payment in paper, it would seem impossible      this to take /objection in principle.   A different situation would certainly arise If the Free State bonds became seriouslydepreciated, &quot;but. in this connection it 1B necessary to remember  that the British Government did not succeed in preventing, the depreciation of the stock issued under theLand Purchase Act - of 1909 and that the 5$ bonds which it was proposed to issue under the Land Purchase Eill of 1920might have fallen below par.   (b)   That It specifically excludes consequential lose.It is already pointed out in the Secretary of State&apos;s Memo.that in the past consequential loss was strictly limited bythe Courts in case of malicious damages.   Here again thereis an important British precedent in the procedure of theDefence of the Realm Losses Commission in respect ofproperty commandeered during the war and in the terms ofthe Indemnity Act of 1980.   Moreover it appears that toabrogate the limitation would mainly benefit the Irishtraders and not the landlord class who have teen the chiefsufferers from the recent disturbances and for whom we arenow particularly concerned.   It is not immaterial topoint out that compensation for malicious damages is not given from public funds in this country at all, and itdoes not aeem possible to ask the Free State Governmentto re-open a matter which was fully discussed in the FreeState Parliament-unless it can be specifically shown that individual oases have failed to receive fair treatment
   (o)   That in certain oaaes a reinstatement conditionmay he attached to an award.Provided that this condition ia reasonably applied, noobjection can possibly be taken by the British Governmentto it.   Not only ia it equally open to the Wood RentonCommission to impose it, but in the cases of compensationawarded by the British Government for damage done in Dublinduring the Rebellion of 1916, the stricter conditions ofreinstatement    on the site was applied and has beenenforced in all oases.   Except vhere the recipient ofcompensation has been driven from Ireland, the conditionmay bo fully justified,   But for it the1 compensation payments might result in a serious drain of wealth from ireland.        It would appear doubtful, therefore, whethereffective objection could he taken by the British Governmentto the actual terms of the Act.   I submit that objection canonly be taken if experience shows that it ia being unreasonablyor unfairly administered by the Free State Courts, or that theFree state Government do not properly implement the awards oftheir Courts.   The British Government by their letter of the26th July 1932 have recognised a responsibility in the matter,not, it should be noted, as regards the loyalists only,hut on behalf of Irish citizens generally-.   But at the same time they have always maintained the vies that it ia the dutyof the Free State Itself to-meet the whole cost of compensationA or Post-Truce damage.   I hope therefore, that we shall bee*reful not to commit ourselves now to endorsement of any; basisof compensation which we could not reasonably press the Free StateGovernment to adopt.   The  damages caused by the disturbances in the Free State ever since the Truce are probably not less
than double the pre-Truce  damages and may therefore wellamount to  SO millions.   If the Cabinet were to adopt theview that the pledge given in Mr.Churchill&apos;a letter of the86th July 1988 requires this: Government to undertake directliability for the whole or part of this amount upon a acaleof compensation higher than, that granted by the Pree StateAct, a burden of many millions may in the end by thrownupon the British taxpayer.
