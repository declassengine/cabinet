THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS- BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S     I have read the memorandum of the FinancialSeoretary to the Treasury on the above subject (CP.573(23))and the reply prepared by tho Lord Privy Seal (CP.379.(23)),.done from a motive of economy which would injure orrestrict the efficient and proper discharge of the greatduties Imposed by the Treaty on all branches of theLeague of Nations Organisation (inoluding the InternationalLabour Office).  I have had now some three yearsexperience as delegate at International Labour   OffioeConferences, and so far as that Organisation is concernedI have always held the view that it has useful funotionsto discharge, and I should strongly deprecate any actionon the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government which might tendto weaken or restrict its usefulness,  Drastic economieshave already been effected in International Labour Officeexpenditure through my action last year and that of Mr,Betterton this year and I am doubtful about the policy offurther wholesale cuts, certainly on the arbitrary lines suggested by the Financial Secretary,     At the same time, I think that we are entitled to enquire whether, without impairing the efficiency of theLeague organisations it may not be possible to effect very&apos;considerable further economies.  We have acquired an extensive knowledge of the working of the InternationalLabour Office mainly through an enquiry conducted atGeneva by Mr0Watson of my Department: as far as I am aware,C A BI NET.RETRENCHMENT OF LEAGUE OF NATIONS EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Minister of            Labour,I agree with the Lord Privy Seal that nothing should be
no information of the same detailed character has been acquired with regard to the Secretariat of the League, andit is therefore not possible to say in advance whether further economies in the League expenditure can be effected.It is quite likely they can.  I am, therefore, so far ingeneral agreement with the Financial Secretary that I thinkfurther enquiries are desirable with a view to securingadditional economies where possible in all three departments of the League activities.  There are two points, however,both of importance, which I must mention,(1)  I am satisfied that the only way in which we could hope        for success would be to press at the Assembly for the        appointment of a strong International Committee of        Inquiry to examine the work, salary-scales, staffing        and organisation of all the bodies concerned, i,e, the        Secretariat-General of the League, the Permanent        Court cf Justice and the International Labour Office,        Whether a definite total sum for the 1925 Budget        should be fixed for the whole expenses of these        three Departments of the League and the Committee        be left to apportion it; or whether the Committee        be given a completely free hand is an important        question, but one which might, I think, appropriately        be settled in discussion between the Foreign Secretary,        the Lord Privy Seal, the Financial Secretary and myself.(2)  I should strongly deprecate further pressure for economy        at the Governing Body  of the International Labour        Office alone, without  similar pressure for economy.        on the other two Departments of the League.  As the        Lord  Privy Seal points out in his memorandum, it        has already been widely suggested that for politioal        and other reasons the  International Labour Office is
       being  subjected  by Great  Britain to far  more       drastic  treatment than the  other two Departments       of the League.   The  Financial Secretary  in his       memorandum suggests  a reduction on the International       Labour Offioe budget of 1923 by 39$ and  of the       Secretariat and  the  Court of only 19$.    I do not       know how these  percentages  were reachedt they       appear quite Inequitable  on the face of  ,them       especially in view  of recent drastic cuts In       International Labour Office Budgets, moreover,       if they  are pressed  in this way on the Assembly,       not only will the  above criticism against Great       Britain  assume  greater force, but, what  is more       important, the  whole proposal for economy will       (in my!view) certainly be defeated,             I therefore  ask the  Cabinet to approve the       following proposals       (a) That it is  understood that, while economies in           respect of  the  work of  both branches of the           League proper and the International  Labour           Office are  desirable, nothing should be done  to           effect them which would have the appearance of           discriminating between the two;       (b) That the British Delegates should press at  the           Assembly for the appointment of a strong           International Committee of Inquiry to review           the  work, salary-scales, staffing and           organisation alike of the League Secretariat,           the  Permanent Court and the International           Labour Office;       (c) That the basis upon which the Committee should           work, should be left to be settled between the           Foreign Seoretary, the Lord Privy Seal, the           Financial Secretary and myself.Ministry of Labour.                (Intd.)  H.B.August 11th,  1923.
