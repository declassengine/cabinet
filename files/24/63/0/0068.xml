[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1918.SECRET.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 11th September, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.An appreciation of the Trades Union Congress is given, and certain shop steward developments are described.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on the military position ; on foreign politics, with special reference to Russia, to the Internationale, and to India; on home politics, with special reference to the right of free speech, to the Trade Union Congress, and to the question of equal pay for equal work; and on the food situation, is described.Part III: District Reports.There has been a revival of discontent in certain districts, notably in London and South-eastern, in South-western, and in North-western districts. The effect of the police strike has been unfortunate.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. There has been somewhat serious strike by electricians in the Liverpool area on the question of non-unionism. The strike of co-operative employees is reported to show signs of collapse.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. The most serious pending dispute is that amoug cotton-spinners in Lancashire. There are a number of other important disputes in progress.I.-General Remarks.The Trades Union Congress.This year&apos;s&apos; Congress, which was held at Derby during the past week, derived its importance in the opinion of the general public mainly from anticipation of its pronounce-ments on War and Peace, and from the indication of the views of Labour on these subjects which it was expected to provide. The importance of the meeting from this-aspect would be difficult to over-estimate, but in emphasising the fact, other points of view must not be overlooked. The Presidents suggestion of the One Big Union, to include all organised labour of every craft and type, is an ideal hitherto unexpressed at the Trades Union Congress, though doubtless familiar to many of its individual members. Other circumstances adding to its importance are the fact of its Jubilee, the record number of organised work-people there represented, the resolution on the proposed seamen&apos;s boycott, the Havelock Wilson proposal for a new constitution of the Labour Party on a purely Trade Union basis, and the defeat of the Miners&apos; Federation on the subject of craft Unionism in connection with the colliery enginemen.Nevertheless, the attitude of the Congress on the question of War and Peace is unquestionably the most important fact under existing conditions, and it may be concluded with some confidence, from what actually occurred, that organised Labour as a whole is unshaken in its determination that the destruction of the German military machine is an essential antecedent to a satisfactory and lasting peace. The official resolution on the subject of the war was of little indicative value. It was a corn-promise resolution of the most non-committal kind, which was accepted with practical unanimity by a body which included men of extreme pro-war views equally with extreme pacifists. It is, however, to be noted in connection with this resolution that Government is urged to open peace negotiations only when the enemy, voluntarily or by compulsion, evacuates Belgium and France. Organised labour is therefore pledged to support the war, at any rate until this consummation.[1100-46] &apos; . B
2Incidental circumstances combined to demonstrate the feeling of members of the Congress, not perhaps as delegates from their respective organisations, but as indi-viduals who have special influence among the work-people. On Tuesday afternoon news of the fall of Lens and Queant was announced by the President, and was received with extraordinary enthusiasm. Again it is reported that of all the welcomes at the Congress none was so warmly expressed as that to Mr. Gompers, the fraternal delegate irom American labour, though his attitude in respect of the war and of meeting with Socialist and Labour representatives of hostile countries is well-known. It is also stated that his speech, which concluded with an impressive warning against conclusion of the Avar before 1 he abolition of the military machine was secured, received the cordial support of the Congress as a whole.Less important incidents, tending to confirm the general impression as to the attitude of the Congress towards the war, were the telegrams despatched to Sir Douglas Haig, Sir David Beatty, and Lord Weir, congratulating them on the devotion and courage of the forces, and expressing confidence that the bravery shown and sufferings endured will in the near future secure a, lasting and triumphant peace for the peoples of the world, and the loud and general cheers which greeted the replies thereto.The resolution moved by the Cardiff Sailors and Firemen condemning &quot; the brutal murders and robbery of British and neutral seamen on the high seas bj^the commanders and crews of German U-boats,&quot; and proposing a five-years&apos; boycott of the German people as a reprisal, was defeated by a blocking proposal, moving the previous question, which was accepted on a card vote by an 8 to 1 majority.Mr. Havelock Wilsons resolution in favour of a distinct political party for the Trade Union movement was proposed by Mr. Davis, of the Brass Workers. The resolu-tion was defeated by a 7 to 1 majority. An amendment proposed by the Operative Printers that a Trade Union Federation should be formed inside the Labour Party obtained more support, being defeated by 3 million votes to 1 million. The latter figure indicates that inside the Labour Party there is a considerable body which is dissatisfied with the existing arrangements. These are felt to allow excessive influence to a comparatively small, but compact and well-organised, &quot; intelligentsia &quot; clique. The dissatisfaction which has been expressed at the Conference is perhaps an indication that the next General Election will disclose an absence of cohesion in the Labour vote.The question of the reduction of working hours to forty-eight per week in all trades led to a result of some significance. An amendment was proposed to reduce the week to forty-four hours, and that a special Congress should be called immediately on the close of hostilities to fix a date on which the Congress decision would be put into operation. Of this date intimation should then be given to the Government and to the employers. The amendment, which was virtually a direction in favour of direct, as opposed to legislative action, was rejected by a very small majority, 2,021,000 votes being recorded in its favour, 2,108,000 votes against it.The remaining point worthy of special mention is the defeat of the Miners&apos; Federation on the question of their refusal to negotiate with the colliery enginernen in a dispute between them as to industrial versus craft unionism. Mr. Smillie has enunciated a deliberate policy of compulsion on all men working in or about the mines to join the Miners&apos; Federation, and it is in pursuance of that policy that negotiations with the colliery enginemen were refused. As a result of the discussion the Congress directed the Parliamentary Committee to arrange a meeting between the Federation and the craft societies. This decision constitutes a set-back to the policy of the Federation.Shop Steward Developments.Since December last there has been in existence at Liverpool a Shop Steward organisation known as the Reconstruction Committee, which has worked in conjunction with the District Committee of the Allied Trades Federation. The latter Committee is understood to have been represented by four members on the Executive of the former. Relations became strained, as was bound to be the case in view of the divergence of their policies, and a proposal is now before the workmen to replace both of these organisations by the General Council, Engineering and Shipbuilding Reconstruction Committee, of which the proposed constitution has been received.      1. This draft constitution prescribes, among the functions of the Council, powers which strike at the root of Trade Unionism.   The relevant passages are as follows: &quot; It shall hi responsible for all negotiations between the men and the employers, the Government and other public bodies, in respect of all questions that aflect the common interests of the whole of the men employed in the industry.&quot;
&quot; It shall have the authority to enter into agreements with the employers, the Government, and so on, subject to any such agreements receiving the ratification of a general meeting of the district.&quot;This is only an additional proof of the recognised and admitted fact that the Shop &quot;Steward movement is in radical opposition to constitutional Trade Unionism.II. Press Comments.I (A.)-Militarij.The operations on the Western front pass without notice in the Labour and Socialist papers, except in &quot; Justice,&quot; which expresses delight at the steady advance cf the Allied forces and rejoices that no German counter-attacks have been successful. It also eompaivs the depressed tone of influential German newspapers at present with their jubilation, during the first six months of the war. An interesting article in the &quot; New Statesman&quot; suggests that the success of the tanks will force the enemy to a line along which waterways can be used as barriers.(B.) Foreign Politics.Russia.The attempt upon Lenin&apos;s life excites a certain amount of discussion. The &quot; Herald &quot; says that with all his faults Lenin is a great man who has successfully withstood unscrupulous capitalism and Imperialism without a single stain on his integrity. &quot; Justice,&quot; while deploring the attempt as an outrage on humanity, also regrets it as likely to strengthen for a time, the Bolshevik Government when it was tottering to its fall.. The usual attacks appear on intervention by the Allies. In a number of notes the &quot; Herald&quot; argues that the revolution has the full support of the people and cannot be suppressed by bayonets. The attraction to the Allies at Murmansk is the possibility of trade. One result of the landing has been wholesale shooting at Archangel, a matter which requires explanation. The &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; quoting the &quot;Times&quot; correspondent at Yladivostock, believes that the Allies are in difficulties in Siberia, and the result of their intervention has been to cause half-a-dozen different factions to try to establish themselves. Such a state of chaos will ensure that the Allies will find an excuse for further interference. The &quot;Call&quot; thinks that the very foundations of the growing Socialist temple are being destroyed by the counter-revolutionaries. Another view is set out by Mr. Leslie in &quot; Justice,&quot;. who states his experience in smuggling arms and ammunition into Russia, and holds that the present state of the country is due to the persistent teaching of Anarchism rather than Socialism. Having, met all classes of Russians during the last ten years, he states that an administrative genius of the highest quality would be needed to evolve order out of their clashing ideas and convictions; their sole common characteristic was ignorance, not only of social I    and political conditions, but even of actual men and things.The Internationale.Mr. Hendersons recent recantation is widely discussed. The &quot; Herald&quot; points to his success in addressing labour conferences, and is pleased at his constant faith in the Internationale, but says little about his mistake in regard to the German Majority Socialists. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; while describing his speech at Birmingham as success-ful, thinks that Mr. Henderson is unnecessarily depressed about the German Socialists, It now takes the view that these never accepted the Allied memorandum, and it could never have been expected that they would. From this it proceeds inconsequentially to &apos; argue that Allied labour must get into direct communication with the Germans. In a I skilfully-worded series of notes in &quot;Forward,&quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald also pleads for a meeting. His sentiments coincide closely with the complicated phrases of the r,esolu-tion passed in the Labour Congress. He urges that the meeting will be a conference to discuss differences and difficulties and to define them, rather than one producing binding resolutions. The opposite view is taken by the &apos;&quot;&apos; Clarion,&quot; which describes Mr. Henderson as presenting a pitiable figure in confessing that he had been deceived. It points out scornfully that as he has not in a number of years converted a single
4countryman in the House of Commons to his views, he can hardly be expected to^ convert a whole nation. &quot; Justice &quot; presents a summary of the speeches and actions of Dr. Troelstra to show his unfitness for trust in bringing about an internationalist Socialist understanding.India.An active propaganda by Indian Home Rule extremists has opened this week in the Labour press. The &quot; Herald:&apos; publishes extracts from a note by Mrs. Besant, complete opies of which have been sent to branches of the Trade Union and Labour movements. She, complains of the censorship in India and of the terrors of the Press Act and the Defence of India Act. In appealing to British democracy, she quotes misleading examples of steps taken by Home Rulers to introduce trade unionism into India, and to ameliorate the condition of the workers. In the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; appears a special supplement on the Indian report, which contains more matter than the whole paper usually has. It suggests, possibly with irony, that the Russian Soviet system should be considered in setting up a new constitution for India, and concludes with a demand for the withdrawal of the proposals in the report and the production of a scheme of genuine democratic self-government for India.(C.) Rome Politics.Free Speech.Many comments are made by papers controlled by the LLP. on the interruptions at the Plumstead meeting addressed by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald. The &quot;Herald&quot; compares this incident and the treatment of Messrs. Bright and Cobden during the Crimean War, and the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; urges that the meeting was not for pacifism, but to assert the right of free speech. In addition to the I.L.P., it was supported by the Trades Council, the Labour Party, and the Shop Stewards.(D.) Labour.Police Strike.The Labour press is not unanimous as to whether the right of policemen to have their union recognised has been gained or not. The &quot;Herald&quot; considers that this has been won in fact, though not in theory. It argues that no body of workers will get their rights without strikes, and it refers to recent instances in the munition works at Coventry, aircraft workers of London, coalfields of Yorkshire, and the trams, &apos;buses, railways, and tubes in London. Passive resistance is the greatest weapon in a democracy. The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; describes the strike as the most remarkable on. record for its suddenness, unanimity, and for the support given by the press. Govern-ment must now accept some form of police organisation. The &quot; Call&quot; claims that the use of police against Labour in industrial disputes will be impossible in future, and the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; believes that the union is bound to grow. &quot; Justice,&quot; how-ever, is doubtful whether recognition can be assumed. It presses that the police should now be put under the control of the London County Council. Brief references are made to the flremen&apos;s claims, and the &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; condemn the delay in treating their case by the Ministry of Labour.Trades Union Congress.While the proceedings at the Congress are being reported very fully, comment in the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; is reserved. Mr. Snowden, however, is confident that at Derby trade unionism will use its power with less reserve and with more consciousness of its duty and responsibility than previously, and he thinks an advance is certain in regard to international action. He abuses Mr. Hughes, whose speech at Derby is described as prompted by the Tory conspiracy to break up the Labour party. In the &quot; Clarion &quot; Mr. Thompson says that after visiting labour centres throughout the country, he finds their attitude more correctly voiced by Mr. Havelock Wilson than by Mr. Smillie and his friends. ,Equal Pay.Both the &quot; Herald &quot; and Mr. Suthers in the &quot; Clarion &quot; maintain that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. Mr. Suthers argues that an employer has no right to pay lower rates to a bachelor or a woman producing the same amount of work
20!jas a married man, and to pocket the difference. In the &quot; Herald &apos;; it is suggested that discrimination in rates will lead to degradation, not only of women, but also of men. The question of Land Women and Motherhood should be considered apart from industry  not in relation to wages paid for work done.(E).-Food.Mr. Hyndman in &quot; Justice &quot; describes the debate at the Food Consumers&apos; Council on the question of a subsidy to keep down the price of meat. He controverts Mr. Clynes&apos;s argument against this proposal, and asserts that all direct representatives of Labour organisation except co-operators voted for the resolution. He praises the Food Minister for increasing the representation of organised labour on Local Food Committees and Councils. He hints at information he has received about profiteering companies connected with the Ministry of Food.National Kitchens.In the interests of coal economy the &quot; Clarion&quot; presses for the immediate institution of large numbers of national kitchens. The dislike of working-men for a scheme which they think though mistakenly savours of charity has still to be broken down in many districts.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.There has been a considerable revival of discontent in this district, mainly over claims for advances, and the example of the police strike, here as elsewhere, has had bad results, as is shown in Part IV. In London the employees of several public bodies threaten to give trouble if the authorities do not concede their demands.The stoppage of Saturday afternoon and Sunday work has caused some dissatisfac-tion among oilmen, beltmen, and millwrights at Cubittfs, who lose about 25s. a week, and a similar reduction also affects women in some branches of Woolwich Arsenal.Trouble is threatened in the London aircraft works, owing to the Trade Unions&apos; objection to further dilution by female labour.On the 8th September an important national conference of district committees in the engineering industry was held in London. About 217 delegates, representing all parts of Great Britain attended, and a number of resolutions were passed, urging Government to withdraw all form of industrial conscription, and to transfer control of labour to Trade Unions, working through district committees. Funds are to be collected.South-Western.Marked unrest is reported to exist at Bristol, principally due to the influence of the London police strike.The Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades Federation, Southampton, is enquiring about hours of work and rates of labour from all A.S.E. district secretaries, with a view to pressing for a working week of forty-five hours.West Midlands.The situation in this area remains satisfactory.A change in the time for beginning work, announced at Austin&apos;s Works, Birmingham, may lead to trouble.On the 7th September a national conference of shop stewards was held at Birmingham, with Arthur McManus, president of the N.A.C. of Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees, in the chair. In place of the ambitious scheme prepared at Liverpool, which was referred to last week, it was decided that shop stewards should continue to confine themselves to the conduct of business inside shops, and leave o1ther business alone. The Mersey delegates then left, and the extremist delegates passed resolutions condemning Government action in regard to Russia., press prosecutions, and political convictions.Dingley complained of being victimised, and received promises of support.[1100-461 C
GYorkshire and East Midlands.The situation in this district is fairly quiet at present.The Trades Union Congress, which was held at Derby last week, is dealt with fully in Part I of this Report.The majority of the Nottingham Corporation employees are willing to accept the wages rates offered by the City Council.The A.S.E. shop stewards, particularly at Derby and Leicester, are likely to treat discharged soldiers as blackleg labour if they cannot prove that they previously belonged to a union.A meeting was held at Nor man ton last week to advocate the establishment of a single Railway Union, to include members of the three existing unions.North-Western.There is considerable unrest in this district, especially among the electricians, over the employment of non-unionists.In Liverpool the London police strike has aroused discussion. The workers say that in case of future disputes they wall not resume work until their demands have been granted.The Manchester shop stewards on the 3rd September passed a resolution that skilled men should refuse to teach any diluted labour introduced into the shops. Messrs. Crossley have been obliged to discharge several dilutees in consequence.Northern.This area remains undisturbed except at Newcastle, where the co-operative employees are giving considerable trouble.Wales.A few isolated disputes have occurred in this district. The miners, however, seem satisfied with the steps taken by the Government in regard to their food supply, and all discontent on that score has died down.At the same time, it is reported that the London police strike has had a had moral effect on the workers.Scotland.Although there is little evidence of actual unrest in this area, it is reported that members of the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee are urging shops all over the district to make demands for higher wages.In &quot;Glasgow, trade unionists are laying emphasis on the fact that the London policemen&apos;s demands were adjusted, even while they were out on strike.Ireland.In Dublin, Boland&apos;s Mills, employing about 400 bakers and labourers, have been closed by the firm, who allege that the Government took over their works sixteen months ago, but have paid nothing as yet for the use of their property, and the firm have received no reply to their urgent enquiries.IY. Disputes.The general situation has been considerably disturbed this week, and much of the unrest may be put down to the effect of the London police strike. A number of the disputes in important industries are due to the refusal of Trade Union.members to work with nomunionistSijand also to the objection of skilled workers to instruct diluted labour, an-objection which has been -more strongly marked since the embargo strike..1(a.) Involving a-Stoppage o:j Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports seven stoppages of work this week.The electricians in eleven of the principal firms in the Liverpool area, including Graysons, Harland and Wolff, Cammell, Laird, and Co., and the Cunard -Steamship Company, cea&amp;ed work in sympathy with  he strike at Aintree, referred to below,
7295over the employment of a non-union foreman. About 1,200 men employed in ship-building and repairing yards were involved, but men in the power stations were not asked to come out.   Work was resumed on the 1.2th September.Three other cases of disputes between the E.T.U. and non-unionists, involving short stoppages, are reported from the Hull area.The employees of J. T. Thornycroft and Co., at Southampton, ceased work to protest iigainst the removal of British wounded from a hospital to make room for Germans.   The German wounded have been removed in consequence.All the engineer chargemen at Messrs. Ramage and Ferguson ceased work on the 4th, claiming an increase of wages.   The ease of the riveters is still under discussion.The riveters and caulkers employed by Messrs. Napier and Miller, who struck for the second time on the 5th over the threatened eviction of Drennan, have resumed work on the promise that Drennan shall not be turned out.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 5,470 people involved in strikes for the week ending the 4th September ; the number at the close was 721.The strike at Messrs. Douglas Brothers (Bristol), reported last week, has come to an end, on a promise by the firm to consider the points raised.The electricians at the National Aircraft Factory, Aintree, ceased work at the beginning of September, because they objected to working with a foreman who refuses to join their union. The electricians employed by several other firms struck in sympathy; work has now been resumed.The Goal Controller has nine new strikes to report, seven of which have already been settled.   The total number of men involved was only 4,230.The dispute at the Llanhilleth Colliery has been settled. No new cases of importance have occurred.The War Office Contracts Department reports three new stoppages.Much dissatisfaction has been caused by uncertainty as to the factories to which the recent advance granted to women by the Ministry of Munitions applies.A strike occurred at J. Feavers&apos; Tinware Factory in London, but work has been resumed on a promise of arbitration.Another strike occurred at Rice and Co.&apos;s Shirt Factory, Exeter, over a claim for the new Trade Board minimum from July instead of October, as existing rates in this shop are very low.Reported from other Sources.There are signs that the strike of the co-operative employees is beginning to collapse since the application of the Munitions Act. The Avonmouth (Bristol) strikers resumed work on the 7th September. At a meeting of the Newcastle employees on the -6th it was claimed that they had won a signal victory, securing, among other things, the removal of the embargo on their free choice of a union for the duration of the war.The employees of the Mitcham Gasworks and the Wandsworth Gas Company, who came out on the 9th, returned to work next day after obtaining the concessions asked for, viz., compulsory membership and recognition of the union, and pay in accordance with the last national award. \ .About 1,800 women are out at Messrs. Crossley&apos;s Motor and Aeroworks, Heaton Chapel, as a protest against the manager refusing to allow discussions among shop stewardesses during working hours.On the 10th the Liverpool coalheavers struck with the demand that their grievances relating to the supply-of beer for -overtime working shall be removed before they resume work. Acting in consultation with the officials of the Dockers&apos; Union, it has been decided to use naval ratings for the coalheavers&apos; work from the morning of the 13th September.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports the existence of several minor disputes.The members of the A.S.E. employed by Matthews and Yates (North-Western area) are refusing to instruct women in the use of certain tools while the embargo on skilled men remains in operation.
8The Ministry of Munitions reports a few controversial cases of importance.The platers, riveters, and caulkers employed by Messrs. Babcock and Wilcox gave notice to leave, unless their plain time rates were raised 100 per cent, above the pre-war standards.The shop stewards at Messrs. George Trollope and Sons, and Colls and Sons, have refused to allow women to be put on new woodwork until all women on woodwork receive lOri. an hour, and all women doing skilled men&apos;s work receive the skilled meu&apos;s rates. The firm contends that the work in question does not require skilled labour.The Goal Controller reports one new case of no great importance.The War Office Contracts Department has two new controversial, cases to report.There is continued unrest in the London clothing trade. The Shop Committees,&apos; in the absence of the Trade Union officials at Derby, put forward a demand for a weekly minimum wage of 41. 10s. The men were persuaded to remain at work provided the Ministry of Labour dealt with their case within seven days.Eeported from other sources.The template makers at Arrol and Co.&apos;s works, Dalmarnock, and at Babcock and Wilcox&apos;s, Renfrew, threaten to strike unless their pay is brought up to Is, 6d jjer hourFollowing the police strike the London Firemen are pressing for a recognition of their Union. They also demand that 20s. out of their war increase of 25s. shall be added to their permanent pay; that widows of men who die of natural causes shall receive pensions of 10s. a week, and they make other requests, some relating to the period after the war.The dispute .among the spinners in Lancashire on the subject of the &quot;Rota&quot; has developed adversely, and, unless some settlement can be reached at the eleventh hour, it is probable that they will cease work on the 14th September, when their notices expire.The Committee on Production heard twenty-five cases during the past week, five in London and twenty at Glasgow. The chief cases were an application for an advance to Scottish Colliery smithy workers, disputes about &quot; dirty money &quot; allowances at Dundee, and a building trade advance at Taunton.The number of differences reported to the Chief Industrial Commissioner is 146, of which ten were claims for the 12-1 Per cen^- bonus. The principal cases still under discussion are the dispute in the co-operative trade (wholesale and retail) and that between the L.C.C. and their firemen.G. H. ROBERTS.o
