O O ftlo3SUMMARY OP ENEMY ACTIVITY FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 9th SEPTEMBER. 1918.1. WESTER N   F R 0 N T.(a) Strength of German Air Forces 8c Changes in Accommodation.Tho strength of the German Air Service on the whole Rattle Front, i,e., Yprcs to Rhoims, and alterations in accommodation are as follows :-Sector   Sheds   HangarsFlanders   t 6 - 9			Lille-	* 1 .     - 59Reconn:	Pursuit: Protect:	Bombing					Lens	465     * 104Flighta			(West of	Hindenburg line			St.    (	*36      *144103	^55            33	23	Quent in(C ambr a1	to St.QuontinMachines			(	-5      + 19909	990          192	228				.. 214	flights          Laon	* 45	GRAND TOTAL	? 2319	machines	(b) Aerodromes.North of the Scarpe, accommodation continued to decrease in the Lille Area, probably owing to the withdrawal of the line, and to a further transfer of units to the battle front.Leas Sector,   Between ftambrai and Valenciennes 4 xew aerodromes were lecabed&quot;and 3   vacated owing to our advance,St.Quentin Sector. The remaining 3S aerodromes west of the Hindenburg line have now been vacated, and 12 new ones have&quot;teeen located between Cambrai and SWQuentin, and a number of aerodromes which appeared to be inactive during the Summer have been re occupied.Laon Sector. 2 new aerodromes have been located.The enemy1s policy at present seems to be to provide accommodation for the bulk of his units in the Cambrai Area, where they are centrally situated for use on the whole battle front.(c) EnemyTs Attitude.(i) General.   The enemy still appears to be apprehensive of thefront of attack being extended northward.   He has undoubtedlyreinforced the battle front between Douai and St.c;uentin*   Thebulk of the scout units appeared to bo concentrated in theCambrai Area from whence they can work in any direction as required. The chief centre of activity during the past week hasbeen north and south of the Soarpe.   Decrease in night bombing isdue to unfavourable weather conditions,(ii) Bombing.   Owing to tho unfavourable weather conditions
-2- 20little bombing activity has been displayed by the enemy.Forward areas near Bethune were attacked.   No Giant aeroplanes crossed the lines.(d) Distribution of German Bombing ?orcen on the Western Front. ^Twin-engine and Giant Macnmes).AREA *1inlanders.      3rd Bombing Squadron - 13th)14th) Bombing Flights Stationed at:*- Gontrode,Mariakerke   15th)and &quot;Maria Alter 16th)   - 36 machinesaerodromes. 17th)18th)501st Giant Aeroplane Flight. -   6 machines.Stationed At:- Scheldewindeke aerodromeTotal - 42 machinesLille 6th Bombing Squadron - 7th)8th) Bombing Flights Stationed at:- Froidmont, Marquain, 9th)and Templeuve aerodromes - 36 machinesTotal - 36 machinesSt .Q,uentin 1st Bombing Squadron    - 1st) Bombing Flights&quot; 2ndStationed at:- .

- o m(e) Losses In German Air Forces - Western Front, 291Aeroplanes,The total losses sustained by the enemy 6n the Western Front, due to British activities, from the beginning of January 1918 to September 8th,1918, aro as follows i-Western Front (R..A.P. with the Armies In tho Field).20R1 machines destroyed. 867 out of control. Total -   2948   machines.5th Group (R.A.F. with tho Navy - Dover &amp; Dunkirk).120 machines destroyed. 145   out of control.Total - 265      machines.Independent Force. (From May 26th - September 8th).47 machines destroyed.. 23   out of control.Total - 70   machines.GRAND   TOTAL - 32S5   machines.2.   OTHER   FRONTS.(a) ITALY.Austrian Air Service.   The arrival of a few Austrian Air Force Units on the Western Front, in order to work with the Austrian Troops already transferred from tho Italian Front, was reported but not confirmed.   But as tho whole situation of the Austrian Flying Corps is so bad, as regards engines, machines, and pilots, it is not considered that more than a few, if any, aerial units, have left, or will leave, tho Italian Front.The recent losses in the Austrian Air Service have been so heavy that the actual fighting strength is estimated to be 35^ below establishment.Tho decrease of aerodrome accommodation in some sectors is probably due to the withdrawal of companies.. -from tho front to be ro-constituted in back areas.V&apos;ith roforenco to tho reported movement of a German Pursuit Flight from Macedonia to Italy, so far no German machines had boon soon on tho front, and all Austrian prisoners are unanimous in declaring that no Gorman machines are existent on that front.   It i3 probable, therefore, that this unit, which undoubtedly left Macedonia, has gone straight through to the Western Front.(b) PALESTINE, MESOPOTAMIA, &amp; SALONIKA.No change, (c)   RUSSIA.W Finland. The German seaplane station at ABO (S.W.Finland)
is confirmed, Finnish airmen arc being trained at tho German Seaplane Station at LIBAU (Kovno, Russia),t   (2) Murmansk Expcditionary For o o. A new enemy seaplane station is reported &quot;under construction on one of the lakes near OBOZERSKAYA, and an aerodrome on the east lido of the railv/ay station,(d) NORTH SEA 8c BALTIC,Seaplanes.During the period &quot;under review there has boon no special activity on the part of enemy seaplanes in the North Sea. Sub-marines and their surface craft arc now reported to be escorted by seaplanes froifl both V/ilholmshaf en and Zcobruggo.Airships.During the period under review there has boon no patrol activity by Gorman airships in the North Sea,A report, at present unconfirmed, has been received to the effect that airships have been sigted in the Baltic Sea.(e) ADRIATICSeaplanes,   Seaplanes.Owing to the low state generally of the Austrian Naval Air Service, Gorman pilots and fast scout   seaplanes have reinforced the seaplane stations at Trieste, pola and Catbarro, Our aeroplanes attacked Cattarro on the 6th inst,, and wore opposed by 6 fast scouts.5, M I S C E L L A N E 0 US.(a) GSR! ANY(i) Policy. The German High Command appears to be turning its attention to Home Defence Flights, This undoubtedly is due to the perpetual bombing by the Independent Force, and to an anticipation of an increase in the future.A Pursuit Plight has already been transferred from the Battle Area to Lorraine, and another Pursuit Plight was reported at the beginning of this month to be on route for Offenburg (Strasshurg) from St.Quontin Sector.The above flights are obviously to reinforce the Homo Defence Plights on tho Rhine, 15 new towns between Cuxhaven. and Freiburg are reported to have Home Defence Plights. The area round Brand (Aachen) has been reported for some time past as . bein  an important centre of activity, one flight is known to be stationed there, 3 Flights arc known to bo in tho vicinity of Essen, and 3 more reported in that district,(* *) New Types of Aircraft.Aeroplanes,A new type of single-seater metal aeroplane has been reported as under construction at the Zeppelin works at Fricd-richshafen. Prom the general defscription it would appear probable that it is intendod for infantry work.*Prom a captured identification book, a number of different types of aeroplanes, of which reporto had previously been received, have been identified, but none arc definitely known to be or have been in use on the Front,
The typco includej-Singlo Scatcrtf&apos;- Roland D.V11Rumple a? IJ.1, Pfalz D.X11Two-seater     * Pfalz C.1Junker C.1A new typo of enginej the 180 h.p.

A now type of reconnaissance aeroplane has been brought down in Italyi the U.C.I. made by tho Hungarischc Flugzeug Akticn Gosollschaft. It is stated to have a speed of 125 miles per hour&apos;, and to bo armed with 3 machine-guns. It is fitted with a 230 h.p, Hiero engine.(o) HOLLANDIt is reliably reported that a train consisting of 26 wagons crossed the frontier from Germany to Holland at Ben the in-.These trucks contained aeroplanes, which from the labels on tho outside of the trucks arc of the Rumplcr type.This train left Jolmnninthal on the 14th ultimo and arrived in Holland on the 20 ultimo.
