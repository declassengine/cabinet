Maritime Transport Council was held at Lancaster House on the 29th and 30th ultimo, L^rd Robert Cecil and Sir Joseph Maclay representing Great Britain.The Council unanimously arrived at the following decisions, subject to the assent of the respective Governments(a) Food Programme for Cereal Year 1918/19.19-*The Food Council&apos;s programme as presented asked for importa-tions amounting to 27 million tons for the three European Allies, this representing an increase of      million tons ahove the actual importations for the last cereal year-.   An increase in the military oats demand from 2-? to 3i million tons was included in there figures.   Increases in the cereal harvests of about 2 mil]ion tons were admitted but full information as to all harvests was not available.Decision^   Programme to be commenced on the purely provisional batiiu of importation at the rate of lOf mi lid on tons excluding military oats.    The military oats programme to be furtne:: investi-gated, and in the meantime to proceed on the-basis of tne o&apos;.-..d programme.   The final programme to be worked to fo:.&apos; food au a whole, to be reconsidered at the next meeting of the Council -   iacanlime tonnage to be arranged on the basis of the above total figure and distributed between the Allies in accordance with the ratios recommended by the Food Council.This decision involves the allocation o  British tonnage for the importation of Allied Food as a whole, instead of as hitherto Allied cereals only, on an agreed basis of requirements.   The British Representatives assented to this decision provisionally and on the understanding that the continuance of the system would ne conditional upon satisfactory shipping arrangements being made with France and Italy and upon America&apos;s programme being included and worked to on equal terms.(b) Civilian Commodities.Decision.   That until further order the actual consumption of civilian commodities generally during the past year should be taken as setting the maximum limit for importation during the ensuing year, this decision not, however, preventing a different distribution as between the Allies or a greater importation of a particular commodity than last year where stocks have beer, used up and a larger importation is required to avoid reduction of con-sumption.I     ( c)      American Army Supply ProgrammeInsufficient information was available as to the programme, and in view of its great importance in the whole Allied Shipping and supply position this fact made the Council^ consideration of the other programmes necessarily provisional, ,A conference consisting of Lord Reading, Mr. Stevens, M.Tardieu and Sgr Cresp:. reported that it had been arranged that the Ambassadors of the 1 European Allies at Washington should request the information desired and/urge
&quot; 64urge that tho responsible American hinistcrs and Officials should at once come to London to deal with the question.It was Btatccl, in oonneotion v/ith the above items in theAgenda that even if no further tonnage were allotted to America,the European Allies started the cereal year 191G/19 with about2 million tone d.w. of shipping less than the previous year.(d).     Invitation to Japan to join the Council.Decision;   That Japan should bo invited to join the Council, &quot;a memroandum explaining the main objects of the Council, (viz to secure such an clleoation of Allied tonnage as would best assist the prosecution of the war) accompanying the invitation, but no actual conditions being attached to ac ceptanoe of membership,(c)        Supply of coaj. to, Italy via prance, and shortage oflieilwoy wagons.The Inter Allied Transportation Council recommended that 350,000 tons of cool should be sent to Italy by the long sea route (U,K./Italy) the supply from and via Prance being reduced to 2a-0,000 v/ith the object of relieving the congestion in the Prenoh railways by the release of some 12,000 r rd lw ay w ag o n s.The authorised progra me provides for 150,000 tons by tho long sea route and 450,000 from and via Prance. An increase of the 150,000 to 250,000, with a corresponding reduction of 100,000 in the quantities railed through Prance had already been authorized.The further increase of 100,000 tons by the long sea route would mean the continuous employment of about 150,000 tnnp o^ shipping.^uciaion:     That, Y/hile tae present shipment uy long sea route of 250,000 tons instead of the 150,000 of the programme should be ocntinued, the further increase is impracticable. Every possible effort should, however, be made to increase the Importation of railway wagons into Prance.(f)        Is linage for gwi ss needs.The Swiss Government had represented that in view of the extension of control over neutral vessels by the Allied/Governments, they acre no longer able to charter tonnage for their essential requirements.Decision.(l)   That the Allied Governments should accept the responsibility for providing tonnage for what the Council agreed to be Switzorlafldis minimum requirements.(2)   That the assumption of this responsibilityshould be in conjunction with a satisfactory      , arrange:.ent as to other negotiations the Allies may desire to conclude with Switzerland.(3)   That the foregoing resolutions should becommunicated to the Allied Governments with the recommendation that they shall take immediate steps to oarry resolution (2) into effect, &apos;
(4)   That tho proposal that the Gorman-Government should share the resv.onsitility for the pro-vision of tonnage (from vessels interned in Spanish or Dutch ports) - which the Swiss Government believed the German Government were prepared to do - should not he encouraged.(g)        A number of other questions ar- to emergency requests for tonnage for France and Italy, the use of double bottoms for oil fuel, and the permanent organisation of the Council were also&apos; discussed,, and referred to the Executive of the Council.Lord Robert Cecil and Sir Joseph haclay,&apos; in assenting to the above decisions, accepted responsibility for recommending them for acceptance by the British Government, and accordingly now submit that they should bevaccepted.September 6th, 1918.
