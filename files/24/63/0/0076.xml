n! (J .JTHE DEPUTY MINISTERTANKS z CONSTRUCTION OF OHATgAUROUX FACTORYSUGGESTED REPLY TO THE SUPREME \&apos;AR COUNCIL, VERSAILLES,The whole undertaking at Chsteauroux for the assembly of Tanks has now been put under one Controller with full powers under the Anglo American Commission.   This unity of control has already led to great improvement.     The Commissioners aro confident that the assembly of Tanks so far as the factory is concerned will be greatly expedited.   It is believed that the Liberty motors will be the limiting factor in the early stages of assembly, but the Commissioners are confident that the output of Tanks should start at the beginning of the year subject to the arrival of American components.    Many difficulties aro being experienced, but the Anglo American Commission is not at present in a position to specify definitely the assistance required.   A full report will be prepared as soon as the reorganisation is completed and-before the next meeting of the Supreme   ar Council.   Instructions should be given that any demands of the Anglo American Commission in the meantime should be met.(Sgd).   ALBERT J STERN Lieut .Colonel.COMMISSIONERM.W.O.A.D.123, Pali Mall.
