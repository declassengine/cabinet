CHURCHILL,I.-STRIKES.Statistics  or Week ending the 28th August.During the week ending the 28th August 1913, 8,635 working days-about one-eighteenth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time-were lost through strikes by munition workers.&apos;&quot;5 The greatest loss of time occurred in the London and South Eastern area, where 3,250 days were lost, 3,000 of them by 1,000 aircraft workers at Feltham.II.-TEMPER OP MUNITION LABOUR.The Outlook.The figures for munition strikes during the last four weeks have been very satisfactory. There have, however, been outbreaks in other parts of the industrial field and symptoms over the whole area of a kind that have demonstrated the need for constant vigilance. The &apos;bus, tube and police strikes can scarcely fail to react unfavourably upon the whole situation. One feature, in particular, of the police strike seems likely to increase the difficulties of the Ministry of Munitions in dealing with stoppages of work. It has always been the policy of the Ministry of Munitions, as well as of the Ministry of Labour, to refuse to negotiate with strikers until work had been resumed, not only because strikes on munition wrork are illegal and because negotiations with strikers would undermine the regular leaders in their attempts to. prevent strikes, but also because negotiations during a strike would lead men, even more than at present, to take the view that to strike was the one way of remedying their grievances. The concession of the policemen&apos;s demands before tKeir return to duty may have been unavoidable, but, like the concession of full pay fur the time of the strike, it constitutes an unfortunate precedent which future strikers will probably endeavour to exploit. To be noted also is the active intolerance shown by the police on strike to the &quot; blacklegs &quot; who continued to perform their duty. It is unpleasant to reflect that this has been the attitude of men who will be charged with the maintenance of order in future strikes in which &quot; blacklegs &quot; may figure.Opposition to Dilution.Rigid opposition to dilution continues to be manifested by the members of several unions, notably electricians and iron moulders. Three months ago representa-tives of armature winders from all parts of the United Kingdom held a conference at Blackpool and unanimously resolved that they would &quot; absolutely refuse to allow females to, perform any armature winders&apos; work.&quot; During August members of the Electrical Trades Union held up production work on aeroplanes at Waddon National Factory by refusing to allow women to continue on the electrical wiring of aeroplane fuselages, work on which they had been engaged for some months. The Friendly Society of Iron/founders do not profess to be opposed to dilution on principle, but their members in various parts of the country have shown great ingenuity in devising pretexts for refusing to allow women to be employed on the moulding of bombs and chemical shells.* For the purpose of these statistics munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in respect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike (a) in the munition industries proper (metals, chemicals and rubber) ; and (b) in certain auxiliary industries, e.g., iron ore mining, brick-making, timber-sawing, &quot;certified&quot; gas and electricity undertakings, &amp;c. x  (33)0496  Pk 50   125  9/18   E &amp; S
This stubborn attitude is to be explained, in part at Yesfit, by the doubts which have been so freely raised as to the binding&apos; nature oil Government pledges for the restoration after the war of trade union restrictive practices. A revised draft of the War Pledges Bill has been completed by the Interdepartmental Committee which has been at work on it under the chairmanship of Sir Stephenson Kent, and it has been transmitted to the Ministry of Reconstruction for approval.At Manchester the members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers have resolved to persist in their refusal to allow the introduction of dilutees or their transfer to machines other than those which they have been working. This policy was adopted as a reply to the embargo on skilled labour. The Committee of Inquiry on the embargo question has already considered the drafting of an interim report, the issue of which may be expected in a week or so.III.-MOVEMENT OF MUNITION LABOUR.Returns which are now being obtained by the local (munitions area) officers of the Ministry make it possible to follow in a detailed manner the changes which take place each month in the distribution of munition labour. A first instalment of these figures suggests the following points of varying interest in regard to the month of June last: 1. Roughly 1 per cent, of munition workers change their employment in a week; the proportions for females, boys under 16, and males over 16 are not very different.2. There was a gain during the month of about 20,000 in the number of women employed and about 2,000 in &quot;the number of males under 16. There was a decline in the number of males aged over 16 of about 10,000.3. The number of males posted to the army during the month was approximately 20,000 as given by the Ministry of National Service, and perhaps exceeded this figure. These were largely balanced, as appears from the figures, by intake of discharged soldiers, and possibly also in some degree by attraction of men from other trades.4. There was a decline of at least 8,000 in the number of skilled men.
