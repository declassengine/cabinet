SECRET14th September, 1918,909(V U1914   ADD   OALLIPOLI   STARSkfcmorandun by the JPirst Lord of tho Admiralty for the War Cabinet3The papers which have boon laid before the War Cabinet on this subject by Mr,Austin Chaalerlain (G,Te.S348), with a note by Mr,Barnes (G-.T.5386), the Secretary of State for India (G,T05413) and tho Minister of Munitions (GpTe5614) have received my consideration; and I should like to lay before the War Cabinet the Admiralty views so far as the proposals embodied in these papers affect the Navy,The history of the institution of these Stars and the scope of their distribution have already been so fully set out that it is unnecessary for me to recapitulate them, but the present position which has resulted from the decision already given can fairly be described as deplorable, and the object of tbis paper is to urq;e upon the War Cabinet the necessity of taking such steps as are necessary to make certain that this position does not become, even worseeThe Admiralty have always understood that the 1914 Star was originally intended as a special recognition of the troops which formed the original Expeditionary Force, that is, the Old Array which went first to France; and they have felt tlBt any- extension of the scope of this decoration so as to embrace any other military or naval unit was much to be regretted.   The Admiralty intention was, and is, to adopt in this war the same procedure as has obtained in the Navy since the Napoleonic Warf^o signalise by the award of a special clasp, successful battles, actions, operations,eto,, considered worthy of such distinction.   The adoption, however, of a similar system by the War Office appears to have been found to be impracticable owing to the impossibility of defining the scope of any particular battle and for other reasons, none of which were applicable in the case of the Navy, and holding the view as they do that the undey-lying idea of the 1914 Star was to cornmemorate the gallant deeds of the old army as represented by the original Expeditionary Force, the decision the Admiralty came to that units afloat should not *be considered eligible, seems incontrovertible.Mr,Crurchill&apos;s suggestions -(a) That the 1914 Star should be extended to all Naval units which came into action in 1914; and ,(b) That the Gallipoli Star should be given to all troops who landed on the peninsula, together with all Naval units who actually came under fire;are fraught with difficulties and, if adopted, can only, I fear, lead to further trouble and discontent.   He cannot,I feel/
I feel sure, have appreciated that if, for example, the Naval forces afloat&apos;which bombarded the flank of the enemy tin the Flanders Coast, the Harwioh Forces under Commodpre Tyrwhitt and Commodore Keyes, and the Battle Cruiser FJeet under Sir David Beatty, all of which battled with the enemy in the Heligoland Right, and the forces engaged in fronting up the 1EM)ENU and &quot;DRESDEN&quot; and at the Falkland Islands,      , are decreed to be eligible to receive the 1914 Star, the claims.of other Naval forces could not be ignored.   For instance, the olaim of units of the Grand Fleet further North which did not come into action will at once arise,  . for they rendered material assistance by covering the safety of the Battle Cruisers and the Northern approaches to ^he Channel,Tho suggestions put forward by Mrtt03iircbill, embrace another point ^hi^h is worthy of notice..   He proposes that, the award of the 1914 Star, so far as regards Naval units, should&apos; be limited to those units which came into action in 1914 and, as regards tho Gallipoli Star, to thoso Naval units who actually came under fire, and I feel bound to point out&quot; that the adoption of these proposals would assuredly-lead&apos;to much heartburning, as thereby a different standard of qualification for the Navy and the Army would be set up, seeing that there.must &quot;be thousands of i.aen belonging to units in France, and Flanders who are eligible to receive the Star without having fired a shot, or even heard a gun fired.   Further, if the &apos;1914 Star is given to Military Officers and men who were at Base Ports in France in 1914, why, if it be given at all to the Navy, should it be denied to thoso who were minesweeping. or patrolling the Channel or North Sea in 1914 (e.g.;the survivors of&quot; &quot;HOGUE&quot; ,&apos;ABOUKIR&quot; and D CRESS Y) or to those &quot;who wore working at Naval Bases in England in that year.   Thoir service is no less meritorious and, so far as regards practical absence of danger, has nothing to differentiate it from service at French Base Ports,.. Subject to what I. have already said, the position with-regard to the award of the Gallipoli Star needs no further comment from me, as it seems to bo unanimously agreed that the present position is quite untenable.   That, the 29th Division.which fought at Gallipoli should be.denied any decoration whilst Transport and Supply Officers at French Base Ports aro awarded the 1914 Star, is so incongruous and unjust that the mere statement of the proposition brings its own condemnation,I venture to suggest to the War Cabinet that th^s tangled position cannot unravelled by discussion at the War Cabinet table, and that any attempt to follow that line -of procedure involves the serious risk of matters becoming Worse instead of bettor.   I recommend to the War Cabinet that the Naval or Military Secretaries of three Fighting Forces, in conjunction with the Permanent Secretaries of the three &quot; Departments, should be constituted a Committee to discuss and consider all the problems involved in granting these Stars and other medals in this war, and that the&quot;result of their deliberations should bo embodied in a joint report which&apos; could then be considered by the War&apos;Cabinet,(SgdJ   ERIC GEDDES.14th September,1913,
