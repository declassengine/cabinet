KEPOBt relating to the War Work of the Board of Agricultureg,-&apos; 0 , for Scotland for the week ending 11th September. 1918?   7x JI. POOD PRODUCTIOHt1. Programme for 1919.The Board haYe had under consideration the question of policy to he adopted for 1919 in connection with increased food production in Scotland, in view of the results obtained this year and present conditions with regard to labour etc.    A scheme has now been formulated, and instructions issued to District Agricultural Executive Committees.(a) The Board have advised the Committees that although the natfcjaal supply of food is more satisfactory at the moment, no relaxation of the effort to increase home production is warranted.(b) The Board&apos;8 original scheme was to secure an additional area of 50,000 acres over the 1918 acreage but the recent withdrawal of the full quota of 5500 men from the land for the Army necessitated a reconsideration of this scheme.(c) Tor the 1919 harvest the Board have not asked Committees for any specific increase in the area of tilled land, but they have urged that their efforts should be directed in the first place to maintaining the acreage of cultivation of this year (a total of 1,650,244 acres) and to endeavouring to improve the cultivation of land at present under crop.   The Committees have accordingly been asked to regard as a desideratum an increased prc-rduction in 1919 equivalent to what might have been expected to have been provided by the increase in ploughed land originally contemplated by the Board.(d) At the same time the Eoard have impressed on Committees that every effort, wherever feasible and especially in corn growing districts, should be made to increase also the acreage under the plough, *;(e) The Board understand, for example, that in some cases Committees were unable during the past season to com-;plete the programme they had drawn up for their own guidance and land which might have been ploughed was for various reasons left unploughed.    The Board have instructed that such cases should be dealt with during&quot; -    ....   the coming, year and Committees have been requested in &quot; particular to direct their attention to cases where .   increased cultivation-was promised for this year but was not carried out. and to take steps where necessary and practicable to ensure that all promises of increased tcropping should be fulfilled in 1919.&apos;.      &quot; (f) the Board have also drawn the attention of Committees ...        to the &quot;terms of the Corn Production (Amendment) Act . t 1918 with relation to their operations in the interestsof increased food production.2. Corn Production Acts 1917 and 1918.Notice was given by the Board in the Edinburgh Gazette
on 5th instant of their intention to Make a Regulation under Part IV of the 1917 Act providing that the period, vrithin which any person aggrieved by a notice may, under sub-section (1) of Seotion 9 of the Act, require any question to be referred to arbitration, shall be 14 days from the date of&apos; service on him of the notice.    Applications for copies of the Draft Notice hare beei invited.3. Supplies for Agricultural PurnpBes.(a) Labour.Although the labour problem has been eased to a consider table extent by the supply of soldier labour during the past few weeks the laok of experienced hands is felt muoh in some parts.    Casual labour is difficult to obtain, and it is probab that harvesting will be delayed especially in outlying district As might he expected, the reports on the quality of the soldier labour supplied vary very considerably.    In some cases it is stated that the men supplied are unsatisfactory and inexperienc while in other districts, such as Perth, Kintyre, Bute, Hoxburg Selkirk, the Lothiane, and Peebles, the assistance provided is acknowledged to have aided very materially in the harvesting operations.(b) fertilisers.:  Blast Furnace; Dust.The Board have prepared for distribution throughout the country a memorandum on the subject of &quot;Blast Furnace Dust aB j , &quot;Potash yertiliser&quot; shoeing terms of sale of the commodity an explaining its.uses as a fertiliser.SulrPhatq of Ammonia.The total quantity-of Sulphate of Ammonia authorised foj -sale by Special Iiicence since the beginning of June is over 17,000 tone, only 628 of which have been granted for direct application to the land.(c) Sale of Horses Order,During the &quot;week,a comparatively small number of applica rtions for licences to sell horses under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2T was received; only 365 licences being , issued.    The total number of licences issued by the Board since the Regulation came into operation is 56178.(di Grain Sacks.    , .  .,- During the week the Board interviewed a representatire I the only private sack-hiring Company in Scotland in connectici with the supply of sacks for home grown grain. It would sef that this Company, prior to the war, were engaged for the moi part in hiring, sacks for Overseas grain trade. Grain import! to this country was loaded in the Company^ sacks at the landing ports and stored on the premises of brewers and merchants for considerable periods. The trade in Overseas t grain has diminished in volume with&apos; the result that about a P quarter of a million sacks belonging to the above Company wit be available for conveyance of Home Grown grain. The releai , . of these sacks will go far to relieve the shortage which wael anticipated in consequence of the increased area under cropJstepe 7
2193.Steps are being taken to bring this source of supply to the notice of farmers.(e) Hav and Straw Order.The Army Council have now issued an Order prescribing conditions under which the 1918 hay and straw crop may be sold. It is provided that producers requiring forage for stock in their possession or under their control must apply to the District Army Purchasing Officer for a licence.    In cases of dispute as to the quantity which a farmer may retain for this purpose and also in regard to prices, an appeal is allowed to the Agri-tcultural Executive Committee for the District.     The Board have circularised Committees drawing attention to the new duties falling on them and suggesting that these should be delegated to 3 or 4 of their number possessing full practical knowledge of the present position on farms and likely to judge fairly between the claims of the farmer on one hand and the needs of the Army and non-producing consumers on the other.    The Board have in this connection &quot;impressed farmers with the need for economy in the use of hay and straw during the coming winter.4. Scale of Charges at Glasgow Cattle Markets.The Corporation of Glasgow recently applied to the Secretary for Scotland for the issue of a Provisional Order enabling them to increase the charges for the sale and slaughter of cattle at the City Cattle Market.     The attention of the Board was drawn to the fact that maximum rates chargeable under the Order were higher than those in force at lierklands Yfoarf, which is the landing place for Irish Cattle.    It eras represented that if maximum charges were imposed Scottish feeders would be under a disadvantage as compared with Irish farmers who sent cattle to Scotland.    The Board accordingly called a conference to which were invited representatives of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Corporation of Glasgow.    From figures submitted by the Corporation it would seem that for the present the maximum rates chargeable by the Corporation under the Provisional Order will not be imposed and the increase now proposed wilj, merely bring the rates at the Cattle Saarket to the level of those at lierklands.    It should also be stated that the Corporation intend to raise existing ratee at tferklands in order to meet increased cost of maintenance,5. Tfer Emergency Advisory Committee.A meeting took place on the 6th instant of this Committee tfhich was set up by the Secretary for Scotland to advise the Board on inatters relating to agriculture.    The Coimuittee discussed at this meeting questions relating tjo Heather Burning, Supplies of Meat and Feeding Stuffs. Tood Production Programme for 1919, the Potato Distribution Scheme, Sheep Worrying by Dogs and issued recommendations to the Board on these matters.
