This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma;jesty&apos;s Government.]*^&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;THERE in at preseat an urgent priority demand for over 100,000 men for munitions, and less pressing demands amount to at least as many more.Some of these demands can only be met by release of men from the Army, and to a less extent the Air Force, and it is not possible for the Ministry of Munitions to contemplate any further appreciable withdrawal of men for the forces, whether skilled or others, unless some of the men now in the fighting forces are returned to civil life.Under a decision of the Council of Prime Ministers, the War Office have agreed to return 325 men recently withdrawn from the manufacture of tanks. The names of the men are being sent to them as quickly as they can be obtained. The Ministry of Munitions are also asking for the return of 450 to 500 men born in the years 1898 and 1899 who have been called up in the last few months from blast-furnaces. Applications are also being made for a not very large number of men of 1898 and 1899 who were withdrawn from the manufacture of scientific instruments, and who cannot be replaced from civil sources. 1 wish particularly to press upon the War Cabinet the need for giving reinforcement of this kind to the stampings and forging industry. The demand for stampings has greatly increased in order to meet certain of the most vital munitions programmes, in. particular, tanks, aero engines, and guns. The output of ships is also directly affected. Unless the increased capacity is fully used, programmes cannot be met, and labour is not forthcoming for the idle plant. The industry before the war employed about 4,300 persons. It now employs over 11,000, and it is estimated that the additional labour of all types now required amounts to 7,100. The comb-out of men of 1898 and 1899 withdrew 400 men and stopped 300 hammers. The number of men required to bring the hammers now idle into operation on a single shift is about 700.The War Cabinet&apos;s authority is asked for (a.) The immediate return to civil life of the 400 men of 1898 and 1899 ; (b.) An additioaal bulk release from the Army and Air Force of 300 men formerly employed in this industry.These additional 300 men should not be limited to men below Category &quot; A,&quot; or men serving at home. On account of the nature of the work, it is essential that the skilled men in charge of the stamps and hammers should be men of exceptional strength, capable of standing great heat.If these 700 men are returned, it will be possible to use profitably a large amount of unskilled and semi-skilled labour which we are making arrangements to train and upgrade. Even with them it is doubtful whether the full programme can be met, but I refrain from asking for more to be released from the Army, because it is doubtful whether, in view of the small number of persons originally engaged in the industry, more men could be obtained.Printed for the War Cabinet.
