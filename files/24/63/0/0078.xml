The object of the Commission is to inquire on the spot, on behalf of the United states Government and especially of the War agricultural administration of tot country, into the agricultural position of Great Britain and the measures which have been taken to meet tTao food situation by increased production.    The members of the Commission have con-ferred with officers of the Board on the agricultural as well as the fisheries side.      They have also met officers of the Ministry of Food.    Many points of interest in and around London have already been visited, e.g. the hop fields and fruit farms of Kent, Covent Garden Market, Billingsgate and smithfield.A ten days motor tour of the country has been arranged, one party to tiiTtl Westwards and another into the Midland and Eastern counties.    This tour would not have been possible except by the kindness of tho War office, who have placed cars at the disposal of the Commission.    This facility is greatly appreciated by the Commission and by the Board.After leaving England tjfe party will visit prance andItaly.fcand Division.Small Holding colonies. ,Holbeach.

In Somerset, which may be regarded a &quot;pig county&quot;, little appears to h-.ve been done or contemplated to stimulate pig production.    in the localities in other counties which have been visited the position is far better.Complaints are, however, general as to the difficulties in obtaining feeding stuffs.    The position in this regard is very unsatisfactory, and unless increased supplies become available it is anticipated that increased sluu&amp;aterin&amp;e of youn&amp; pigs will become necessary.- 3 -
a 9 ifelt) 1Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture andMinistry of Pood.During the week upwards of 700,000 copies of the Cereals (Restriction) Order, Joint Committee Leaflet Ho. 10 have been distributed.     This Leaflet embodies the Order and gives a full explanation of   it3 main points as chey affect farmers, pig owner8, poultry keepers and others.Prom the many letters received as a result of the issue of the leaflet it has become evident that widespread dissatisfaction and discontent exists among these classes of livestock owners as to the feeding stuffs position.     All over the country stock feeders experience   very great difficulty in obtaining the necessary, feeding stuffs for their livestock, and the little feeding stuffs available appear to be of inferior quality, retailed at eccessively high prices, and very unequally distributed.. The continuance of this situation suggests the danger of the possible diversion of human foodstuffs of a cereal nature to the feeding of small livestock, owing to their comparative cheapness and the difficulty of detection of misuse.The Deputy Director met the Joint Committee&apos;s County and District Representatives for Shropshire in conference at Shrewsbury on September 7th.Ordnance Survey.Maps were despatched as followings during the week:-War Office ......     3,552.Air Ministry ....   10,278.Admiralty .......   38,916.Overseas ........ 240,790.Other Services ..        326.The number of maps printed at Overseas Branch Ordnance Survey during August wa3 301,423.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets was 1,229, in response to which 4538 copies of leaflets were despatched.In addition 27,500 copies of Leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.- 4 &quot;
