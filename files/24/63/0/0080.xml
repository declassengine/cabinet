a/i28i.mmm of blooxajhs information .Tho Danish dolegatos at M ohington take exception toour proposal thai; tho surplus Danish produce set aside for Great Britain but not actually purchased shall bo exported to destinations approved by tho Allies,     his 1b the only aiffi-oulty now outstanding.    re have accordingly agreed to waive this condition.    We are pointing out to the United States Government that we cannot purchase at a loss foodstuffs not required in the United Kingdom and. thai; Germany may possi-bly obtain some of those supplies.    It is clearly to the interest of the Allies to purchase any surplus which might otherwise pass to Germany.    fe accordingly enquire whether the United States Government are prepared to bear part of the prospective loss.The Banish Government have informed the United States War Trade Board that&apos; they propose to sign a definite Agreement with Germany respecting the granting of German safe conducts to Danish ships.    S.H, Government trust that the United tstates Government will refrain from making any comment, or from assent-ing in any way to the principle of the proposed agreement.    We could hardly-approve the proposed Gor roan-Danish Agreement in view of the difficulties we have raised respecting the German Agreements with Norway and Sweden.mimtj.        The United States are believed to have deferred pro sent ing their protest at Stockholm against the recent exports from Sweden to Germany in contravention of the Swedish Agreement to which we alluded-last week. matter is&apos; clearly one\for united action.by all the Allies.    The Allied Blockade Committee in London have meanwhile considered the question in detail, and the members of the Committee are forwarding to
9 rt q&amp; .their several Governments the draft of a joint protest.    in the draft tho Swedish Government are asked for tether partieu-lare as to some of the exports in question (Vide Summary of Aug. 16-22)*    The exports of pyrites are denounced&apos; as a&apos; breach of tho express terms of the Agreement, and the Swedish Government are asked for an assurance that no further exports of pyrites to 0 rmany will be sanctioned.The Swedish General Export Association have rejected the overtures of an accredited agent of the German Government who proposed that the Association should cooperate generally with Germany in trade after the war and that they should in partial-lar persuade their members to assist in cloaking German trade with the Allies *    All the Bound inavisn.countries have-now refused to entertain &quot;suggestions for a post-bellum economic agreement with Germany.An Agreement has been reached between H*M* Government and the Swedish Government for disposing of the goods in transit for-Russia which have bean detained in Sweden since the Russian revolution.    These goods will be mostly sold for account-of the owners for consumption in Sweden.within the rations fixed by the Swedish Agreement ant! subject to guarantees against their.  re-export.    The Swedish Government will requisition any goods which the owners refuse to sell them.    Goods passing to finland will be allowed to go forward only on condition that an equivalent quantity of Russian transit goods of Allied origin or financed.  by Allied interests arc returned from Finland to Sweden to be disposes of under the above scheme.M^Tir^Rltidffi^.    The Netherlands Export Company are sending delegates to lon&amp;on to reopen negotiations respecting the Dutch fishing-trade.    They will have powers to conclude an Agreement on the
lines luid Iown In previous discussions, and only technical amendments will bo considered.BRUHD.    Partly owing to tho Italian silk and cotton scandals and. to the charges of bad faith brought against officials of the in the Italian Chamber of Deputies,an investigation has been made into the present working of the Society.    According to the investigator^ report, the Council of the 3.S.3. which is responsible for the discharge of the Society * a obligation towards the Allies, is In no way implicated;   but it has little real control of the Syndicates which represent the various Swiss industries oon-oerned and no effective powers of investigation.    Applioa-tions from importera recommended by the Syndicates are pro-visionally accepted by the Central authorities of the S*S*S* and, on the importer signing tho usual guarantees, the goods may be imported for his account.     In these circumstances very much depends Upon an effective supervision of the Syndicates.     She Allied Delegates at B orne have no control over the proceedings of the Syndicates.   One of these Syndicates, the Embroidery Syndicate at S t. Gall, has been systematically evading th   regulations of the Society.    H.M. Government are asking Sir H. Rumbold to report xuicther upon the supervision exercised by the S.3.S. over the Syndicates and on the character of the Syndicates themselves,   also to consider whether our commercial intelligence service!in Switzerland could be improved.     There appears to be sons need of a bettor watch on the trade between I taly and Swit-zerland and between Switzerland and Germany.     ,We noted last week that the Italian Governa&amp;nt proposed to release for Swiss consumption 10,000 bales of raotton which are at present lying in Italy.     Tho Italian Government state
4.that no firtispeot consignments will be relaasefl but only stocks &apos; belonging to bona fide bwisy f irras.    There are eorae 40,000 bali e 01 cotton stored in Italy for Swiss account.It is now certain that the Swiss will bo unable to obtain sufficient shipping for conveying Swiss supplies from overseas.    The Germans arc offering theia vessels internet in Spain, in the Dutch,Bast Indies and in South Africa;   but the shipping offered anly amounts to some 40,000 tons ana wo are not disposed to favour the acquisition by Suritserlaad of German ships for this purpose if alternative tonnage can be found.     The Swiss estimate their fainimum requirements at some 180,000 tons dead weight.    We are&quot;proposing to the French andGovernments that we should jointly guarantee to place at the disposal of  witaerlaad sufficient tonnage to carry 50,000 tons of- imported supplies monthly.    Htll. Government would under-take to find 2/5the of tho tonnage required.    We are asking the United States Government to find another S/eths and the French l/5th.PA IB.   The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs assured tho United States Ambassador at Madrid, on his presenting the Allied pro-pest against the validity of German safe conducts granted to neutral ships, that there could be no question of the Spanish Government officially recognising German&apos;aafe-conduots or authorising Spanish vessels to accept them.    He said that Spain &quot;would not surrender her right to navigate the high seas&quot;; and that, if any vessel of the Transatlantic Company sailing to American ports without a safe conduct should be torpedoed the Span-lah Government would confiscate German property it spaM.  he $pan-ish Cabinet may,however,prove less firm in their views than the Min ister of Foreign Affairs. It is reported that the Germans aro offer ing to hand over to Spain sis or seven of the 6 orman vessels in Spanish harbours in compensation for Spanish ships sunk outside,
5.the danger zone.     The Gor trans thus hope to placate Spanish opinion without surrendering their claim to sink neutral ship-ping in the prohibited area.SOUTH AMERICA.   A contract between the United States   ShippingBoard and the Peruvian Government was signed on September 6th under which the Board - ill take over the Gorman ships in Peruvian harbours.    All the Gorman vessels in Chile have been disabled by their crews, except three vessels for which the Chilian Government are negotiating.     The Chilian  Port Auth-orities, hearing explosions on board, demanded access to the vessels.but were refused.GERMAN 3UBMAHIBI BXDGKADB,   The following is a summary of the lossesto merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which wore reported in the period Sept. 6-18 inclusive.
