(&quot;*&quot;n,s Document 18 the Property ot^Av       His Britannic Majesty&apos;s.Oovernment) , *\---------g^ Qt 18tHOTT: Oil TIF- SITUATION IN RUSSIA AND BXBHIIA.1,      The information conveyed &quot;by Captain Steveni!s telegram, No; 45 of September 2nd, (copy attached), and confirmed today by the Japanese Military Attache, is of the highest importance because if -the facts are as stated the Czecho-Slovaks in Western Siberia have effected their junction with the Allied forces advancing from Vladivostock, and the Allies have now got complete through com-rnunication from Vladivostock to the Volga.     As suiting that this situation will not be materially altered by any possible action of the Bolshevik and German prisoner forces, that are reported to have moved north from Chita up the Amur railway, it is important that a definite decision should be taken forth,/ith as to the strategical employment of the Czecho-Slovak forces east and west-of the Urals.       With their line of ccsamunicatiohs secured and their rear protected by the Japanese forces east of Lake Baikal, the refitting and equipment of the Czecho-Slovaks is ensured, and they will be at liberty to concentrate for action in whatever direction Is most desirable.2*      The front at present held by the Czechoslovaks Is approx-imately the line Kazan - Samara - Orenburg with detachments be-tween Ekaterinburg, and Perm, west of the Urals.        In this area they are stated to have some 40,000 troops.    The Allied forces with whom it is desirable for then to effect a junction are (a) General Poolefs forces advancing from Archangel and now on the line Obozerskaya (on the Vologda railway) - Bereznitzkaya (on the river Dwina); and (b) General Alexeieff1s Cossacks reported to be moving up the Don towards Tsaritsin.     Over and above the Bolsheviks immediately in contact with the Czecho-Slovaks, the main hostile forces to be considered are four German divisions, reported to be concentrating about Kharkov and Beilgorod, whoso object is probably the protection of the Donetz
141 -2.Goal Basin, and the separation of Alexeleff from the Czecho-Slovaks on the Volga.,     It is probable, therefore, that any immediate advance of the Gzecho-Slovaks towards the Donetz would encounter superior forces of Germans.    On the other hand, in the north there appear to be only some 16,000 to 18,000 Bolsheviks between the Czecho-Slovak detachments west of the Urals and General Poole.     It is of the highest import-ance that a junction should be effected with the latter and that the Allies should obtain control of the railway from Ekaterinburg through Perm and Viatka to Vologda, in order to secure through communication with Archangel and to enable supplies from Western Siberia to be sent to the population of Northern Russia, who must otherwise be reduced to starvation.3.    The moment is highly opportune for an advance westwardsfrom Perm? for General Poole has just been reinforced by thefour American battalions and is advancing successfully towardsVologda,     With the Vologda - Viatka - Ekaterinburg railwayin our hands., it will be possible to establish a front betweenVologda and Samara, after which our forces can be concentratedtowards the latter place with a view to moving down the Volgaand effecting, a junction with Alexeleff.    When this hasbeen effected the Eastern front will actually have been re-*.1/156/   constituted as adumbrated in the General Staff Memorandum of 476 .A19th June, and may be expected to exercise a direct influence on the German position in France.4.    To enable the Czecho-Slovak forces to carry out these operations, it is essential that the Japanese, after detaching troops to the northward to deal with the hostile1forces on the Amur railway in the direction of Khabarovsk and north-east of Chita, should move westward along the Siberian railway, taking over the guarding of the railway and&quot;releasing allCzecho-This Memorandum was prepared by D.M.O., but not circulated.
