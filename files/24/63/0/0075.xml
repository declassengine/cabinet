opy.vB/ORAIW, BY PME ADELAIDE l^E^^P&apos;COLLECTIVE REPRISALS.In Maroh 1915 His Majesty^ Government subjected 10 officers and 29 of the crews of submarines to special treatment which involved no sevem hardship.The German Government replied by placing 39 British Officers, Carefully selected, in view of their real or supposed social position) in solitary confinement, feeding them atrociously and allowing them practically no exercise,   popular pressure in England shortly forced His ).-.&amp;jesty&apos;9 Government to give way, and it was agreed that submarine prisoners should be treated preci-seiLy-in the same way as other prisoners of war.In April 1916, the British Government transferred some German combatant prisoners from England to Prance to be employed under British supervision.   They were well fed and properly housed and cared for.   The Germans thereupon retaliated by transferring 2,000 British prisoners to Russia under German occupation, where they were employed under extremely harsh conditions *   These men -were retained in Russian territory until His Majesty Je Government ultimately brought the German prisoners back to the United Kingdom in the Sprang of 1917,In May 1916 complaint was made that money sent to British prisoners of wax in Germany was not paid at the current rate of exchange but at the pre-war rate of exchange, which meant a discount of sane 25$.   Upon the British Government threatening to pay money remitted to German prisoners of war in this country at the pre-war rate of exchange the German Government gave way and consented to pay at the current rate of exchange and to refund the amounts -kept back,January 1917 a   The German Government complained that German prisoners were improperly employed in proximity to the firing line on the V/estern Front and demanded their withdrawal to a distance of 30 kilometres.   In conjunction with the French Govern.-ment, His Majesty *s Government refused, to do so/  The German Government thereupon sent British prisoners to work close behind the lines &quot;both on the V/estern and Eastern Fronts under conditions of extreme brutality. The treatment, was deliberate, and the men were enoouraged to write home and relate their experiences. The German Government shrank from no extremes of cruelty, starvation or even murder.Shortly after the joint decisions of the two Governments to withstand the German demand, the French Government gave way, without consultation with His Majesty ls Government, and the latter were forced to do the same in April, 1917,In January 1918 the German Government sent 45 British who had been at Ruhleben to Havelberg - a very bad camp used mainly for criminals.   His Majesty&apos;s Government threatened reprisals collectively at, V/akef ield and Bonnington if ,&apos;they were not returned to Ruhleben.   The Germans thereupon threatened counter reprisals at Ruhleben.   At the conference at the Hague in June it was agreed to &quot;drop&quot; all reprisals on both sides till matters had been gone into.   Meanwhile things remain as they were at Havelberg.In February 1918, in view of the many petty annoyances and improper treatment to which British officers had been subjectedat
at certain damps in the loth German Army 0 ;rps District, His Majesty*s Government retaliated by subjecting all German office in tho Northern Command to equal arm yanoes and by withdrawing privileges.   The German Government replied by counter measures&apos; retail a,ti on.At&apos; the Haaaie Conference the German Delegates offered to withdraw all British officers from Olauethal and -Holzminden (the two camps c /noerne-d) on condition that certain complaints relati to Kegworth and Duffry Aled were attended to, This was agreed! (pending ratification of the agreement) and in the&apos;meanwhile reprisals on both- sides have beep .suspended, thus leaving mattei as they were in February.INDIVIDUAL REPRISALS.,In June 1916, a German Noh-C*mM ss/idned Officer (petzel) i sentenced after trial by British Military Authorities to a lengt term of imprisonment because his native servant was in possessit of dum-dum bullets. The German Government asked for a re-trial, which was refused. This re upon the German, Government placed two &quot;British officers, captured on the &quot;Moewe&quot; in solitary confinemei stating that soft nosed bullets had been found in their luggage, The British Government selected two prominent German officers fi reprisal. The Germans imprisoned two British Field officers as counter-reprisal and His Majesty&apos;a Government replied &quot;by imprisi Irig two German officers of equivalent rank. The matter was discussed at the meeting which; took place between the Delegates The Hague in June 1917,, and as the result., all the parties, Pet: included, were released iron prison.In October 1916 in consequence of a dispute &quot;between the ton Governments over the exchange of some consular officials, the German Government threatened to subject two Civilians at Ruhleto Messrs. Lambert and Balfour, to special treatment.   They were informed by His Majesty&apos;s Government that in that-event, two German civilans of good social standing would be subjected to reciprocal treatment.   The German Government thereupon gave an assurance that Messrs,. Lambert and Balfoux would not be molestfIn December 1916 the &quot;Caledonia&quot; (in Charge of Captain Blaikie) was captured by a submarine, after having attempted to ram the submarine in self defence.   His Majesty*e Government threatened reprisals should the German Government see fit.to murder Blaikie as they had done Fryatt,   Blaikie was exoneratedIn July 1917 Sir John Irvine, a prisoner at Ruhleben was transferred to Havelberg.   His Majesty&apos;s Government threatened t send two (prominent) Germans from Alexandra Palace&apos;to Knockaloe unless Sir John Irvine was returned within 4 weeks to Ruhle-ben. This was done the day before the 4 weeks elapsed.The question of retaliation arose at the recent conference at The Hague in connection with the dropping of pamphlets from aeroplanes.   In May 1918 the German Government had tried and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment two British aviators who had &quot;been caught dropping pamphlets over the German lines .and His Majesty*s Government had threatened reprisals if the two office in question were not released from cells immediately.   The. Gemat
9 9 9w (j wDelegates at The Hague stated that as this practice was &apos;&quot; out sidethe scope of acts of v/ar&quot; they intended to imprison all airmen whohad so acted, and asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to agree tosuspend this practice in future.   This has been refused by HisMajesty&apos;1 s Government who contend that the dropping of pamphlets i&apos;s not contrary to International Law and threaten     to adoptretaliatory action should the German Government persist.The only instance in which retaliation on a wide scale seems to have been successfully employed against the Germans occurred in the early period of the v/ar, when the Russian Government in consequence:&apos; of the ill-treatment of Russian prisoners placed German officers in men&apos;s camps.   It is understood that this acti on was sue cessful,   &quot;The conclusion to be drawn-from the above summary seems to be that whereas reprisals; or even the threat of reprisals in the case of individualsfhas achieved success, whenever we have embarked upon a system/collective reprisals, the results from our point of view have b^en thoroughly unsatisfactory.It may also be safely assumed that Germany will always b&apos;s in a position to outdo, any reprisals which we&apos;may undertake, since our people will probably- shrink from going to the extreme length necessary to&apos;secure success.&apos; &quot;It may be objected that the Russians have succeeded by reprisals in&apos;securing their object.   This is true in one case known to us but it is truoe because the Germans believe that the Russians certainly are so callous to&apos; human suffering that they //ill go to any length, in cruelty&apos;.to the -individual to secure &apos;their object.   In this matter if in no other the Germans have accurately understood the mentality of the&apos;people - of this country,The fact is that the1.real difference between the two nations   &quot; is that the British have some regard for prisoners in their power and will not&apos;go to extremes in their treatment of them, and the&apos; Germans have absolutely .no&apos; such feeling at all.ADELAIDE LIVINGSTONE,15th August, 1918.1
9 9 9 (*j Ci t)OBSERVATIONS EY LORD BE^uN ON MEMORANDUM BY DAME ADELAIDE LIVINGSTONE.With regard to the conclusions drawn in the above Memorandum it is advisable to draw attention to the fact that the reprisals in connection with Petzel, Havelberg Gamp and the 10th German Army Corps, were interrupted in consequence of the conferences which took place at The Hague in 1917 and during the present year.     It is therefore impossible to state whether they would have been effective or not, had they been continued.It should also be borne in mind that at the time the Memorandum was written, the Germans held more combatant prisoners than we, and were in a more favourable military situation.     The situation is how reversed, and we must have at the present moment a majority of at least 50,000 combatant prisoners, besides holding a much larger number of civilians.Experience shows that German treatment of prisoners varies in accordance with the course of the war, and the probability is that, under present circumstances, the German Government might be more amenable to threats of retaliation now than at any time in the past.     The conclusions drawn in the Memorandum can therefore scarcely be accepted as final, and should also be considered in the light of our own Improved military situation.(Signed)   Newton.PRISONERS OP WAR DEPARTMENT, ROYAL   COURT,HOUSE Off LORDS,    S.W. 1. -12th.
