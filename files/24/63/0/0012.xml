G.T. 5612.IL9 ridFOOD IMPORTS INTO UNITED KINGDOM FOR CEREAL YEAR 1918-19.Memorandum by the Food Controller,The ComraitUe of Representatives of the Inter-Allied frood Council submitted to the Allied Maritime Transport Council a programme of food Imports for the United Kingdom,Prance and   Italy, in the cereal year 1918-19, providing for a total import in that year of   23.4 million  tons, of v/hich the British share was 13*5 million,   The Allied Maritime Transport Council have informed tho Food Council that provisionally and pending the examination of other programmes they propose to provide tonnage for a total programme of 18,5 million tons,-of which British share is 10,5 million tons.In my view a reduction of British food Imports to 10.5 million tans involves eo complete a reversal of the policy of not rationing bread and such grave risk of injuring the productive efficiency of the nation   and causing popular unrest, that it should ar&amp;t be agreed to under any circumstances,     I am bound therefore to place the position at once before the War Cabinet, and to ask for an early decision,upon It,The total programme of British imports for 1918-19, as submitted to the Allied Maritime Transport Council, amounts, as stated above, to 13,500,000 tons (exclusive of military oats,)   This, after allowing for the specific military items still included in the programme, Is certainly -not more than the minimum programme of British imports for the year 1910, approved by the War Cabinet, which itself represented a cut nearly 1,500,000 tons on the actual food imports of 1917, and of some 4,000,000 tons on the imports of 1916.   I am satisfied that this-total of 13^ millions is the minimum required to provide with security for the morale and comfort of the civilian population, and to maintain the presentreserve/
reserve stock of essential foods.In view, however, of the strong representations made bythe Allied Maritime Transport Council, as to need for tonnage tetransport American troops and supplies for them, I have carefullyexamined the extent to which, on the ground of urgent militarynecessity, it might bo possible to reduce the food programme,and the effect of varying degrees of reduction.     The totalamount at issue is 3,000,000 tons, being the difference   between13*5 millions proposed by tho Pood Council and 10.5 millionswhich Is being acted on provisionally by the Allied MaritimeTransport Council.The following paragraphs shew the effect of successivereductions in three stages1.     FIRST CUT : It would be possible to reduce the fullBritish programme by roughly 1,300,000 tons without dangerouslyaffecting human consumption, on the following conditions(a) A reduction of animal feeding stuffs by 500,000 tons so as to bring it to the minimum of 8,100,000 tons of concentrated food (grown and imported) agreed  /upon with the Agricultural-Departments.   This figure is 30$ below the pre-war figure of concentrated &apos; foods-.   In addition, the root and hay crops of 1918 are estimated to be nearly 25$ below the average of the last ton years.(%) A reduction of the cereal stock at the end of theoereal year to the equivalent of eight or nine weeks&apos; supply, an amount sufficient to enable proper  -distribution to be made, but less than the standard prescribed by the Cabinet.   This will reduce the full programme figure by at least 600,000 tons.(6)A reduction of 200,000 tons on other commodities, made partly by taking from stock and pertly by restricting consumption.The first condition will involve the rationing of feedingstuffs.   The second raises a question of general policy on whichthe War Cabinet alone can decide.   The third represents the limitof possible saving on human food other than cereals*A reduction of 1,300,000 tons would bring the Britishprogramme for 1918-19 to 12,200,000 tons, which is 200,000 tonsbelow/
bolow the actual Imports in, 1917-18-   liven these imports only sufficed for the maintenance of the population by the aids of drafts on stocks to the extent oX some 850,000 tons,     Stocks of cereals and of oilseeds and cake were both seriously depleted.    To provide for consumption both animal and human in 1918-19 at the same level as in 1917-18 with-tut a further draft on stocks and apart from any gain on the harvest the imports in the coming year should actually exceed those for the past year by 850,000 tons.As is pointed out in tho Note on Harvests and Stocks appended to this memorandum, there is on the estimates hitherto used little,or no aett gain in tho present year over last year if the feeding value of the root and hay crops is considered as well as that of the grain crops2*    SECOND OUT:   Beyond 12,200j000 tons a further reduction of Imports is possible without bread rationing only by reducing  feeding stuffs below the agreed minimum.     Probably a further cut up to 600,000 tons could be made if we were prepared to render the maintenance ef the oettager&apos;s pig almost impossible and to incur serious risk of having te reduce the meat ration after Xmas even below the 15 oz. now eon-temp la ted.   This figure of 500,000 tons must be regarded as the limit if possible reductions without bread rationing.Any attempt te make a yet larger cut on feeding stuffs would probably defeat its own object through the   difficulty of enforcing restrictive regulations upon the farmers-   At a certain point the pressure on farmers to use their wheat and barley illegally for livestock would become so great as to defeat all attempts at prohibition, and the contemplated reduction of feeding stuffs would in fast fall on human food.Any attempt to reduce the imports of commodities other than repeals ($.or human consumption would involve hardship and popular unrest alto-gether eut of proportion to the degree of the   saving effected.(5) THIRD CUT:   Beyond the measures indicated above, a further saving of Imports could be   effected only by the rationln
9 0lot bread*   The possible saving here depends of course directly upon the degree to which consumption Is forcibly reduced by rationing. Since the total weight of cereal products going into human consump-tion In 1917&apos;-18 ia roughly ssix million   tons, a reduction of about one fifth In the consumption of all cereals would be required to save 1,200^000 tons of Imports. I think I need hardly say that I should regard any such measure as fimacJa^   with Incalculable danger * I adhere entirely to tho view hitherto adopted by the government that bread rationing should be avoided at almost any costt
3DMy general conclusion is., therefore., that whlla the wt$X*&amp;l programme of 13-! million tens is the lowest which I should he Justified in agree leg to m my own responsibility, it may be possible, if the War Cabinet are satisfied that reasons of primary military importance necessitate such a course, and subjeot to the risks and on the conditions indicated above, to provide for the feeding of the civilian population in the coming cereal year on the basis of imports representing a reduction of 1,800,000 tons below that pro-gramme, and amounting to a total of 11,700,000 tons.The jUvorglnc calculations assume harvests approximating tothe estimatee upon which the programme was framed.    If Infact the harvests prove to be better, a proportionate re-duction can of course, be made throughoutCon the other hand I cannot exclude the possibility thatowing to unforeseen contingencies It may pr^ve necessaryto revise the programme upwards instead of downwards * areThere/at the present stage Inevitable elements of uncertainty in the calculations.In Mr. dynes1 $absence 1 sign this olaufrb on his behalf.MINISTRY OP POOD.

NOTE A: HARVESTS AND STOCKS.0Allowance for the difference between the harvests of 1917 and 1918 does not, on present estimates, substantially affect the import requirements.The grain crops of 1918 are estimated to exceed those of 1917 by a total of about 794,000 tons.   In this oalculation wheat is taken at 1,740,000 tons in 1918 as against 1,578,000 tons in 1917*. barley at 1,240,000 as against 1,184,000; and oats at 3,900,000 as against 3,324,000 (excluding seed In each case.) The total crops for 1918 are thus 6,880,000 tons as against 6,086,00$ tons in 1917,On the other hand, the root and hay crops of 1918 are estimatedto be materially below the crops for 1917, and still more below theaverage of ten years.   The most recent estimates made by Sir HenryRew for the Board of Agriculture are as followst-Average Deficiency of 1918    Deficiency of 191810 years   1917    1918   on average on 1917    in.terms of maize. ......    on average of 1917*s        28,3   24,8    22,0    - 6.3 -2.8     )&apos;   . ) 800,000 400,000ds      11.4   10,4      8,9    - 2.5 -1,5     ) x               x15,3   13,1     11.5 700,000 360,000Allowing for half hay deficiency being made good by 3traw.It will be seen that in terms of maize 1918 root and hay cropsare reckoned as yielding a deficiency equivalent to 750,000 tons of, maize below the crop &quot;for 1917&quot;,   &apos;i&apos;ne area sewn \n th potaceias&apos; is&quot;greater than last year but the yield per acre is not expected tobe so high and the total yield will consequently be littlehigher.   The decrease on root and hay crops thus practicallycounterbalances the estimated Increase of the grain crops.It is of course, possible that the estimates in respect of both the grain crops and the root and hay crops will need revision and the import programme is in all cases assumed to be liable to revision when the actual amount of the crops has been ascertained.The only marked changes   in stocks during 1917/18 have been in cereals,oilseeds and cake and su$ar.   Cereals are estimated to have fallen during the cereal year by 600,000 tons, oilseeds and cake by 450,000 tons.. Sugar has increased 200,000 tons.   In all stocks are therefore 850,000 tons lower.
4!&apos;0alfl are the.only foodstuffs in which any reduction of stock, can he Mitoiuplated, for oilseeds and cak-^aro at tho point of endangering curjbpliea of margarine and milk, sugar is only sufficiently high to &quot;carryit, on present shipping arrangements, safely through the year, and wcks of oiler commodities are in the aggregate but small and to agfge extent held on Army account.IPrtm (1) and (2) it fellows that if, without drawing on capital isuraption during the present year is to be on the same scale as g 1917. imports must be approximately 850*000 tons higher.
%NOTE B   MILLING PERCENTAGE(1) It. is to be noted, that the arguments of the preceding^Memorandum are independent of the rate of extraction assumed in milling, since anything given on the indent for human food by raising, the extraction is lost on the1 indent for feeding stuffs,&apos; a compensatory import being required to make up for the diminished offals.   The Ministry of Food programme necessarily covers both food and feeding stuffs, and in considering possible reductions both have been taken into account.2)   The Shipping Controller appears to be under the impression (G.T.5400) that an extraction of 80 per cent, the basal rate accepted by the Food Council, represents for this country a considerable re^ duction of extraction &quot;in order to make bread more palatable&quot;. An extraction of 80 per cent with a dilution Of 20 per cent is, however, the extraction and admixture on which the Wheat Exeoutive programme of the past cereal year was based, and the programme for the United Kingdom for 1918-19 is baaed on the same extraction, the same admixture, and the same consumption as before.(3)    The figure also represents very little change from the actual practice of the cereal year just closed as regards the average    * extraction of flour in the loaf.    A contrary impression has possibly been created by tho fact.that considerably higher i^ktes of extraction have ruled for wheat milled in the    United Kingdom, the rate having at one time touched 92 per cent.   But at times during the year the home milled flour has been diluted with enormous quantities of imported flour obtained at a rate Of extrac ion well under 80 per cent, and the average extraction of flour in the loaf, as near as can be computed, was very little over that figure.     it is hoped that this ye&amp;r relatively more Ijjheat will be imported in the form of grain and the milling extraction will therefore naturally be lower.   Allowance has of, course bean made, in the Feeding Stuffs programme, for the larger quantity of offals that will be obtained in this way.I
