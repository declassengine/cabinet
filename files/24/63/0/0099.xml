SHIPBUILDING OVERSEAS.     .During the past week two steamers have been delivered The s/s &quot;WAR CARI30G,, a wooden steamer built in British  Columbia, and the s.s.&quot;WAR HATKOR&quot;, a steel steamer of 3400 tons, built at Port Arthur, Ontario. REQUISITIONING TONNAGEThe ex-Norwegian steamer &quot;AUDAX&quot; has been lost by ememyaction.COAL POSITIONThe general position as regards the amount of coal available for export has improved in the last two weeks, but even over these two weeks there is a percentage shortage on the whole programme of 10,35$ and a shortage of roughly 22$ over the last two months.Ships are, however, not being sent away now in ballast and the number of vessels waiting for coal is small.
It must, however, &quot;be emphasised thai the easier position is due, not to the fact that a sufficient quantity of coal is available, but to the fact that temporarily the supply of tonnage is not so plentiful as has been the case for the last two monthsj the reason of this is, that during the shortage of coal in July and August a large quantity of tonnage was sent away in ballast and has not yet returned, MIHERAL POSITION.The supply of tonnage for iron ore during August has been maintained at 550^000 tons and Ironmasters appear to be satisfied with their present stocks.Shipment of all available Spanish lead has been effected and Greece is again in a position to export 1,000 tons a month.For North Spain, tonnage exceeds the production whereas the position in the Mediterranean is the reverse.Various labour troubles have arisen at Spanish ports but have ended quickly.   The Spanish authorities have begun to ship a percentage of grapes on certain of the mineral transports, as they are entitled to do under the terms of the Anglo-Spanish Commercial agreement,Messrs. Sota &amp;&apos;Aznar, Spanish owners, have intimated their Inability to renew the agreement under which they ran a certain number of their steamers consecutively with iron ore and return cargoes of coal, on the ground that uncertainty as to the intentions of the Spanish Government in regard to Spanish shipping, makes it impossible to enter into any general engagement just now.  They are in fact continuing to run their hosts in the ore trade, and it has not been thoughtexpedient to press for a formal agreement at the moment,  The sinking of one of this firmfs ships, the &quot;AJCJPERI MENDI&quot;, is now a matter of political interest.  The vessel was outward bound with coal, but had brought a cargo of ore to thife country and had performed many similar voyages?
U &apos;ia n Another - firm of Spanish owners, the Nervion. Company,- baouranieired an. a^e^Dme^ for-^^ ore voyages hy twoof their vessels.In London advantage has been taken of the reduced coal imports to discharge, phosphate and pyrites at the special berths and 4200 tons was discharged from one ship in 23 hours, 9. American Trooping.   The steamer &quot;PERSIC&quot;, engaged onAmerican trooping was torpedoed off the Scilly Isles on her homeward voyage to the United Kingdom,   She had about 2,000 American troops on board.   There were no casualties, and the vessel was brought into port in the Scilly isles.   The American transport *;N0UNT VBRHOM11 has also been torpedoed, but has been brought Into a French port under her ovm steam, 10. Leave Services, (a) Arrangements are  being made for theconveyance of a certain number of British troops from Egypt to the United Kingdom,(b) The question of the provision of necessary tonnage for conveying leave men from Basra is still under consideration,(c) It is hoped that arrangements will be made for the first party of Australian troops, returning to Australia from France on leave, to be embarked towards the end of the present month and to proceed via Egypt,(d) The Salonica leave service is continuing. Stores for the British Army in France, The quantity ofMilitary Stores discharged in France in the week ending 7th September was 164,435 tons, compared with 163,326 tons during the previous week, 12.
