The, onlyquestion remaining outstanding was whether the . War Cabinet..would approve, as a matter of policy, Of the technical training&quot;of hatives.

152THE C01&apos;!] ITTXE had under consideration paragraph 2 (b), (c) and (d) of part III of the Memorandum by   the Secretary of State for Air on the subject of American Aviation referred to the Air Policy Committee by the War Cabinet, (\/ar Cabinet 417, Minute 13).r ftTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that on the 23rd Kay last the \7ar Cabinet gave its&apos; approval to a mission headed by General Brancker being sent to America. This mission went out with the definite objectives of, firstly, advising that an American Air Staff should be set,up, preferably in Europe, and seoondly, of discussing -the American Aviation programme,   The mission had been well received but progress, except in an advisory capacity, .had been very difficulty     The seeds, hov;ever, v/hich had been sown by the miosien were already showing good results. In America no one responsible could be found to settle anything about a joint programme without a full knowledge of General pershing&apos;s views end necessities which had not been fully expressed to the American authorities.   The consequence was that General Brancker and his staff were only able to explore the situation.     Arrangements had, however, been made to loan&apos;British aviation and technical officers to America, and this would react in the favour of the British Air Forfve and assist in building up an Aviatiun programme.As one result of the visit of the mission, the   -production Department in America has sent Mr, Lockhart to Europe and. he has been-followed by hx,, Stettinius to whom full instructions had been given.   Lord Weir said that he had seen both these officials and after Mr. Stettinius had seen General Pershing, a final programme for American aviation had been put forward which wa3 far more moderate than any before suggested.     The origins,!, programme for land work only was for- 266 squa-drons exclusive of long range bombers and. existing machines.   The programme now put forward. t$ be completed by the 50th June next, was for 202 squadrons including all existing machines and any long range bombers.   One disquieting feature was that no proposals were put forward for extreme&apos; range bombing machines. - The pro-gramme was one only to meet the needs of- the Amerioan Army, but included many night bombing squadrons.It should be understood that the American LTaval Aviation programme was-entirely distinct from the Army, programme.     This programme was proceeding well from the point of view of production, and from the operation cr organisation points of view promised better than the Army programme., -The preparation of the American Army and Navy pra-gramme disclosed not only the number -of &quot;Liberty&quot; engines which they would require, but also,,the number which would be available for the Allies.   It had been the intention, of the American representatives to hold a meeting last week in Paris and to allocate the number of &quot;Liberty&quot;, engines up to December next.. l,Cr. John Ryan had, however, been put in full, charge of all American Aviation, with the exception of Uaval Aviation, and he was now on his way to Europe.&quot;   It was hoped to hold a meeting in Paris very shortly at which the numbers of these engines would be allocatedLORD WEIR
153LORD WEIR expressed, the opinion that the policy of the Air Council should &quot;be to. continue to co-operate, with the Americano.as best it could rather than to attempt to carry through a combined programme *   It was useless to expect any early help at all from the Americans with regard to&apos; long distance bombing,     Questioned as to whether there would be any chance&apos;1 of the Americans being able to complete their proposed programme, Lord Weir said that, at present, they had 24 very mixed squadrons, most&apos; of the machines of which had been supplied from European sources,.. . If the1 American Army was engaged in a big fight, its air force would be weak for some time,   In his opinion, it was much more likely that the production programme would be arrived at than that the organisation would be complete.   It was probable that the Americans could have 160 squadrons ready by next summer.if they make greater exertions than they were doing at   present.SIR ARTHUR DUCKHAM said that the output of American Aeroplanes and engines was beginning to improve.     The Americans were, in addition to the Liberty Engine, making 300 h.p. and 200 h.p, Hispano Engines.The Committee agreed that up to the present all possible steps had been taken with regard to co-operation in an aviation policy with the Americans, location     3. .      THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum programme for   of the Secretary of State for Air (G.T,5425) a note by the Royal Air   the Chief of the Imperial General, Staff &apos;( G.T .5495) and for ft a,a Memorandum by the Admiralty (G.T..5569) on the Allocation programme for&apos;the Royal Air Force.&apos;THE SECRETARY OF--ST ATI! FOR AIR said that fulfilment of the total programme of squadrons for allocation ts the services was dependent on two f asters...(aj   Man-power , (b)   Engine SupplyWith regard to.(a) the  iar Cabinet deoision to the effect that the Minister of National Service should arrange from month to month.with the Secretary of State for the Air the requirements of the Royal Air Force.    (Y7ar Cabinet, 446, Minute 8) was too indefinite.   with regard to (b) owing to changes in the industrial situation and to -changes of priority the Minister of Munitions apparently considered that he could not carry out the&apos;estimates on which the programme was based, unless certain conditions, not yet put forward,. were carried into effect,, There was no.reason, however, why the programme should not.be.&apos;discussed.-.   This programme was Intended.to be completed by&quot;September 1919. Should&quot;there be a temporary breakdown, the fulfilment of the programme would only be postponed.   Lord V/eir said, that he did not propose &quot;to di-scuss the question of air policy as no k progress&apos; could be made   if ho entered into&apos; dttails.   ThereWere two points with regard to the. Admiralty and V/ar Office Memoranda.to which he would allude.   Firstly, with regard to,the-&quot;Admiralty Memorandum (G..T.5569 ), para 7 which -alluded to the&quot;responsibility of the Admiralty In laying down the strategy&apos;in connection with the Anti-Submarine campaign.Lord Weir
1544.Lord Weir emphatically disclaimed, on behalf of the Air Ministry, any Intention of criticising; tho submarine strategy.   He expressed the hope that the &quot;First Lord or First Sea Lord would give the Air Council information as regards the results achieved by Anti-submarine Aircraft, ec that the Council could have better information on the subject.   The Air Council fully appreciated the sympathetic manner in whioh their efforts were met by the Admiralty.   With regard to the Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (G.T.5495) Lord Weir called attention to the following para-graph. &quot;The effect of the Air Ministry&apos;s proposal to increase the Independent Air Force will be to give Ivjatfshal Foch control of a number of squadrons at tht expense of the British Army in France&quot; and pointed out that Marshal Foch does actually at present control all aviation, except the I.A..F. in France and could, through Sir Douglas Haig, * at anytime move British Flying Squadrons from the British tc the French line if he thought it necessary.   On the other hand the I.A.F.. could be removed from France and would not then be under Marshal Foch&apos;s orders..   A proposal had been put forward to M. Clemenceau that the I.A.F. should remain an independent Command, so far as British units art concerned.   Lord Weir was convinced that III, Clemenceau believed this proposition a sound one and that the British part of the Independent Allied Air Force would be left free to continue its bombing operations in Germany.With regard to the criticism on the alloca-tion programme, Lord Weir said that he believed -that, for the bombing of Germany, machines would be supplied by France, Italy and perhaps America by approximately June of next year.   Thi-s&apos;accession of strength would enable the,Air Council to reduce the,proposed programme for the I.A.F,   It has been proposed that by September 1919, the I.A.F. should have 63 squadrons of which 14 only should be in Great Britain and 54 in France.   He was prepared to reduce the number in France to 42 squadrons, provided that number could be attained by June&apos; 1919. The balance of the squadrons, estimated for,.oould then go into the pool for the Navy and Army to fill vacancies shown;in the allocation programme.. The result of this proposal would be that the I-.A.F. would be reduced by 12 squadrons which opuld, be allocated to the.Navy and Army as required, but the reduced establishment of the I.A.F. would -be completed 3 months earlier than the complete Navy and Army establishments.   With regard to the emergency reserve of 22 -squadrons-,\ it was&apos; proposed to reduce this by 12 by giving 5 squadrons of fighters -to the Army and putting the remaining 7 into this period between.-&apos;June and September and allocate them between the Navy and Army.   It was impossible at the moment to define-the,actual number to be allotted to each service but roughly the Army would have at its disposal, exclusive of Home Defence -between 135 and 140 squadrons and the Navy-between,102 and 107 squadrons,   Lord Weir reminded the Admiralty that these figures were
&apos;5. JKKmade out on tht. basis of, not only maintenance of wquadrons, but also allowing for wantage which basis had never been talc en into consideration before in naval practice and. which made, undoubtedly, a very oonciderable difference in the total strength alloca-ted to the Navy.THE SECRETARY &quot;OF STATE FOR WAR and the FIRST LORD CF THE ADMIRALTY agreeing with the proposals of the Scoretary of State for Air as regards allocation of the Air Forceo for Army and Navy..,Tho Committoo approved of the proposals as set forth&apos; in Lord Weir1s statement, and the -Secretary of State for Air undertook to forward to the Admiralty ana War Office copies of the programme of allocation altered in accordance with his-proposals,-Power. 4. GENERAL SMUTS pointed out that the Air Counciloould not expect to obtain all the personnel asked for in its proposals to maintain 328 squadrons.&apos; Lord Weir had asked for 136,000 men to be allotted to the Air Force for 19.19.   In view of the number of men which could be recruited during.1919 this was a figure far beyond what could be given to this Force, &apos; taking into consideration all the other demands on the Man-Power of the country.SIR ARTHUR DUCXHAM said that, as regards pro-duction,  the programme could be carried out but for - one limiting factor.   There would be a shortage.of about 1,000 men in stamping and forging for aircraft production and a further shortage.in stamping and forging for&apos;the production of Tanks. - The labour for -.production of armaments, instruments and aeroplanes was sufficient.THE SECRETARY&apos; CF STATE FOR WAR said that, while he must safeguard the interests of the Army as regards maintaining its strength in order that it might carry out its necessary work at the front, he could not &apos;oppose the withdrawal of some 1,500 men in order that the estimated Aeroplane and Tank production programme could be carried into effect.   He was much more alarmed at the demands on Man-Power made for personnel for the establishments of the Squadrons of the Royal Air Force.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that every effort was being made to economise in regard to the ratio of the number of men to the number of machines.    The  . &apos; present proposals worked out at about 40 men per machine, but this number included seaplanes, lighter -than air machines, and personnel for instructional purposes.LORE WEIR urged the difficulties of economising in Man-Power when building.up.    The-material available for the-R.A&apos;,F. was&apos; nearly all rag, and had to be trained;.up.   If the Fcrc:; was given trained mechanics, it could easily do with half the number1it was asking for.
1566vLORD MILKER said the programme put forvnro. for the RtA.4.F. was eased en- the assumption that the personnel for -528 squadrons would he available.   This was very improbable-,&apos; There must,  therefore, be pro-portional curtailment in all services.   Tanks and Aeroplanes were no good if there were not sufficient infantry - Tanks had been most successful, but the time might come when seme efficient anti-tank gun or seme ether means of countering this mode of. offensive might be found and then, as always, the brunt of offence and defence would have to be borne by the infantry who were and always would be the decisive factor in ws/r,The Committee decieed that t-It was ef urgent importance that the War Cabinet should,,  at the earliest opportunity, give its decision as to the a] location of the available Man-Po^er in the country to the various Services.Whitehall Gardens, SSL 6th September, 1918.
