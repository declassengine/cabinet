SECRET(This Document is the Property^ &quot;hTs Britannic MalesVs OovernmeiI   IMEMORANDUM ON GERMAN WAR AIMS,General Principles of German Peace Offensives.At the present time there can be,little doubt that a fresh German Peace Offensive is in course of preparation, to be launched this autumn. The recent speech of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Dr. Solf, lias initiated this peace campaign, which, however, for technical reasons is unlikely to attain its fullest development until some time in Odober, when, the fighting&apos; season being at an end, the moment is more propitious for anything in the nature of a diplomatic demarche.Inasmuch as the methods of the enemy practically never vary, the new peace offensive is certain to receive the best possible democratic window-dressing, so as to make appeal to pacifist opinion throughout the world, but to England in particular, where the partisans of &quot; peace by agreement &quot; are to be strengthened from without. For, notwithstanding the influence and power of America, England (in the enemy&apos;s judgment) is still the soul of the coalition against Germany. For&apos; the general purposes of this game of political deception, therefore, a variety of means may he employed, some of which are calculated to have far-reaching outward effects, such as the proposed dissolution of the Prussian Chamber on the question of the Franchise Reform Bill, &amp;c.....Fundamentally, however, the position is unaltered, in so far as neither a genuine democratic reform at home nor an honest diplomatic demarche abroad are intended ; the whole object of a so-called peace offensive, even in the eyes of relatively moderate men (e.g., ilerr von Kiihlmann).being to obtain by negotiation the greater part of what the extremists previously sought to acquire by force of arms alone.Fundamental Principles of German Terms in Peace by Negotiation.The difficulty of establishing the exact German war aims lies in the fact that the adherents of the party in power, i.e., of the Pan-German Military Block,1 have no settled policy; their expansionist designs being affected by the fluctuations of the Avar barometer to an extent unknown to any other belligerent Power. In its extremest form, Pan-Germans2 oL: the so-called &quot;Patriotic Party&quot; or &quot;Imperial Loyalists&apos; Party &quot; (e.g., Tirpitz, who leads the former) demand (a) Comprehensive aggrandizement of Germany in Russia, by means of directand indirect control of all territories from the Baltic Sea (converted into a German lake as a &quot; mare clausum &quot;) to the Black Sea ;(b) In the West, the restoration of the &quot;frontiers of 1552,&quot; which gave Germanypreponderance in the old Duchies of Flanders and Burgundy, as also the whole of ancient Lorraine and Alsace.These demands may appear grotesquely extreme at a time when the fortune of war has forsaken German arms, but it is to be noted that they were expressed in May last when Germany believed herself triumphant.The so-called &quot;Moderate Pan-German Militarists&quot; who at this hour still rule at General Headquarters (Quartermaster-General von Ludendorff being their head) desire : (a) In the East.Here the enemy&apos;s ambitions are definite, because to the present leaders of the German nation the real prizes of the war lie in the East.For this reason is there a far greater consensus of opinion ; all German parties having gone back one by one on the &quot; Reichstag Majority Resolution&quot; of July 19th,1 This party comprises: the Junkers or Agrarian group, the Prussian Protestant Party, and the so-called &quot; Conservatives;&quot; the Military Party proper, the officials, constituting in Germany a very numerous body, the &quot; Scliwerindustrie &quot; or Arniament Interests plus affiliated Press, the &quot; Patriotic Party,&quot; the &quot; Imperial Loyalists,&quot; and the &quot; &quot;militarizedbureaucracy &quot; in occupied territories.2 German terms : &quot; Vaterlandspartei. &quot; and &quot; Kaisertreue.&quot; (33)6465-lc
1 The Reichstag Majority Resolution of July 19th, 1917, advocated a peace &quot; without annexations and indemnities.&quot;2 The, last of the so-called &quot; state-preserving &quot; parties to eliminate this resolution from its party programme was the Progressive (Radical) Party (Freisinnige u. Fortzchrittliche Partet) iu April 1918. In iieu of the &quot; Verziohtfriede &quot; the &quot; Sicheruugsfriede &quot; was adopted.3 General Hoffman, in his pre-war experience, served at least three times iu tht^Russian section of the German Great General Staff and in the Manchurian war was, attached to Kuivkis army. Filled numerous missions in Russia.-1 Equals about 5 per cent, of the total of population.1917,1 not only in principle by eliminating it from tlio respective party programmes,2 but in practice by express approval of the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest, both of which were acclaimed in Austria-Hungary and in Germany without a dissentient vote other than the &quot;Diplomatic Opposition &quot; (composed of ex-diplomatists wholly or partly out of power) and the &quot;Minority Socialists&quot; who sustained immediate defeats at by-elections April-May 1918, their total loss in Saxony alone amounting to 100,000 votes.In fact, Rumania being still, in letters, the Treaty of Bucharest stands to-day unchallenged ; while the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk comes in for revision, not because it is fundamentally at variance with, the governing principles of the Majority Resolution, of July 19th, 1917, but because military disappointments necessitate its partial modification.This is important, as] it points very clearly to Germany yielding to necessity, not to any &quot; change of spirit.&quot;Austria-Hungary, strange to say, has in theory adopted the Reichstag Majority Resolution of July 19th, 1917, as an integral part of its foreign policy ; that same resolution which in Germany itself is a dead letter. Yet, in practice, the treaty of Bucharest, which is flagrantly expansionist, is held up to public praise by responsible statesmen (e.g., Count Czernin, &amp;c.) on account of its &apos;: moderation.&quot;Another point to be considered is that German pyschology, so lamentably inadequate as a rule, is thoroughly abreast of all problems relating to Russia, because German General Headquarters has always stood possessed of remarkable experts. First and foremost among these is General (Max) Hoffmann, whose experience of the Russians, with and. against them,3 is unique. The same applies to Field Marshal Hindenburg, who, in all other respects a professional soldier of great merit, in politics-follows blindly in the wake of Pan-German extremists. But, as regards Russian questions, he has expert knowledge of his own, which he partly acquired himself and partly assimilated from the teaching of his late brother, whose son survives as his confidential adviser. Apart from that, on Finnish problems Hindenburg poses as a specialist of many years&apos; standing. Lastly, Ludendorff, the political head of the Military Party, notwithstanding his more sober judgment on matters relating to the Western front, sees eye to eye with, the Pan-Germans in all questions which concern Great Russia, Little Russia, Poland and the Ukraine.The new Secretary of State, Rear-Admiral von Hintze, another &quot; expert,&quot; also belongs to this school, the teaching of which is : To consolidate German influence under cover of a continuous harrier of buffer-states on the principle of Quartermaster-General Ludendorff, by the creation of autonomous or semi-autonomous Stales, which are to he between Germany&apos;s old political frontier of 1914 and the &quot; Wolliynian watershed,&quot; or, on a line corresponding roughly to the 2o0 of Longitude E. of Greenwich (from the Gulf of Riga to Kamienietz-Podulski).Finland. North of this line, Finland, Hindenburg&apos;s cherished State, is to be united to the German cause by the monarchical principle upheld by. a German princeling and by commercial treaties.Baltic Provinces. In the Baltic Provinces, where the nobility is largely German in sympathy and almost wholly in extraction,4 these old &quot; German colonisations &quot; are to be closely reunited with the German Empire by German rulers, commercial treaties (Riga, Reval, &amp;c, as trading centres), tariff and railway conventions, and last, not least, by the direct supervision of whatever mode of government is.adopted. Above all, wherever Catholic influence is predominant (as in Lithuania), it may not be fostered even by a German princeling (e..g., Duke Wilhelm of Urach), lest, religiously or constitutionally, measures be taken which might prejudice the interests-of neighbouring Prussia.
Poland. The same applies to Poland, which may not come under tlie political and religious influence of Austria the so-called Austro-Polish solution having&apos; been vetoed by the Emperor in his capacity as King of Prussia, all promises to the contrary notwithstanding but must acjopt a form of government which is Prussian-controlled, so that the commercial development of this now Kingdom (led to the sea via the Prussian port of Danzig) may accord through railway and trade agreements and military conventions with the interest of Prussia. The veto of personal union between Saxony and Lithuania on new lines, or between Saxony and Poland on historical precedent, conforms to the same principle that Poland must not become a Catholic and independent State in detriment to Prussia, bufonly a wire-pulled buffer Kingdom. No territory which is now Prussian, but Polish in sentiment (e.g., Posen) is ceded to this new fiction of Poland ; on the contrary, Prussia as sponsor and tutor to the new State seeks a guarantee against all Polish irredentism within her borders,Ukraine. South-east of these semi-autonomous border States, where Germany can interfere any time she chooses, lies the new Ukraine Republic, which is also a buffer State, but under the joint protection of German and Austrian bayonets.To facilitate its economic exploitation during the Avar (which go far has largely failed) this State has been forced to conclude treaties of peace with all its neighbours, and Germany rules through the -Hotmail Skoropadski absolutely. Whoever objects-including Ministers of State who actually were the first to sign the peace with Germany goes to prison.Beyond the borders of this ring of buffer States, while the war lasts, the greater the confusion the better, since it necessarily retards the recovery of Great Russia.(b) In the West.Belgium. -The more moderate among the ruling class, e.g,, Ludendorff, envisage the kingdom of Belgium eventually restored, though unindemnilied, and adminis-tratively divided (in furtherance of future German intrigues). The Tirpitzian extremists (Patriots&apos; Party and Imperial Loyalists), however, g6 further ; Belgium is not only a pawn in all negotiations, but in negotiation with England Belgium is what occupied French territory is in negotiation with France.Only the most pacifist Germans envisage an indemnity to Belgium for her sufferings and then only (in most cases) in the form of a first charge on such parts of the Belgian Congo as are to be ceded to Germany in exchange for her lost Colonies or in addition thereto if these are restored to her !France. As for France, no indemnity is considered. Even moderate elements covet the Briey basin, if possible by direct acquisition, or alternatively by a commercial agreement giving the Germans equality in mineral rights with the French.Alsace-Lorraine. -Even some pan-Germans are prepared to cede to France such parts of iUsace-Lorraine as are now in her possession plus a few additional villages. But no extensive cession of territory is conceivable unless it is enforced at the point of the sword. Even the Minority Socialists are opposed to the cession of Alsace-Lorraine for fear of the consequences of such action upon the German steel industry.Colonies-So far as the colonies are concerned their recovery is a point of honour with about three-fourths of the parties of the Reichstag. Certain experts, like Solf, are in favour of an exchange of colonies, in the hope of bettering Germany&apos;s position!Only as regards Kiao-Chao, even the most sanguine pan-Germans realise that it cannot be recovered from the Japanese.Trade War. The trade war after the wav-which is most dreaded is to be avoided by negotiation ; Belgium and occupied French territory being a pawn, not only in all matters relating to the colonies, but in all guarantees required against commercial differentiation by tariffs or harbour dues to Germany s disadvantage. .CONCLUSION. &apos; 1The above represents the views of the so-called &quot; state-preserving&quot; parties, i.e., the Conservative, National-Liberal, Pan-German, Imperial Loyalists&apos;, Patriotic and Progressive (Radical) Party, i.e., all except the Centre (Catholic), the Majority
and the Minority Socialists. Of the three last-named, the Centre is in general agreement with the &quot; state-preserving bloc,&quot; but somewhat non-committal owing to Prussian-Protestant aggressiveness in the heyday of Germany&apos;s success (June 9th, 1918). The Majority Socialists, suborned by the State and losing in influence at the polls, are committed to the support of window-dressing schemes designed to deceive thei world, as and when Germany must resort to negotiation. As for the Minority Socialists, these, defeated in by-elections before the Germans reached the Marne, require the continuous and serious debacle of Military Policy before their very limited influence can prevail.The same applies to the so-called &quot; Diplomatic Opposition &quot; (ex-diplomatists, ex-ministers and ex-generals in opposition). The sane and reasonable counsels of this small group can only prevail when the Militarists are defeated at their own game. But even here the danger is, that the few white men this parly contains will be used as catspaws in peace negotiations for the purposes of deception.As things stand to-day, moderate and sane men have no adequate share in the responsibility of government, which is in the hands of what is called the bloc of &quot;state-preserving parties&quot; which are in fact dragooned Chancellors, Ministers, Deputies and all by the powerful party at Imperial Headquarters whose views, set out above, are the only ones which count in practical politics.(
