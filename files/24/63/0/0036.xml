SECRET.MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.102Report for Week ending Wednesday, September 4, 1918.PART L-ACTION  TAKEN.Speaking at Derby on September 2, the Food Controller said that notwithstanding the bountiful harvest, there could be no relaxation of food restrictions and economies. We must think of food in terms of ships and of American troops awaiting transport to France.Mr. Clynes, who attended the Trades Union Congress as delegate from the General Workers&apos; Union, took an opportunity to thank the members of the Consumers&apos; Council for their services to the Ministry of Food. The Council was formed in response to his own suggestion that organised labour should not stand outside administrative emergency work, and its existence reflected the anxiety of labour to be useful in a great State service. With reference to an announced resolution dealing with national kitchens and restaurants and favouring a State subsidy for meat, he declared his intention of extending the number of kitchens and restaurants. He pointed out, however, that labour ought not to commit itself to subsidies for food without mature consideration, as such a policy might have an adverse effect upon the wage claims of labour.The Congress passed a unanimous resolution in favour of State ownership and management of the supply and distribution of milk.The Food Controller is considering the situation involved in a strike arising in the first place out of an application for an increase of wages by the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees, which claims to represent all classes of labour in the co-operative movement.   It is alleged that whenever a benefit is conferred on a craft union, the A..U.C.E. endeavour to secure an additional benefit for their own members.   There are two distinct disputes.   The A.U.C.E. made demands on retail societies in the West Riding of Yorks for certain increases of war bonus, and the recognition of the principle of equal pay for female substituted labour.   They agreed to go to arbitration on the matter of increased pay, but refused arbitration on the question of substituted female labour, and subsequently issued strike notices against ten societies in Yorks.   A conciliation conference was held at the Ministry of Labour last week, but the Union declined to accept less than their original demand.   The conference, therefore, proved abortive, bub the Union were threatened with a pro-clamation in the event of their persisting in their strike notices, such proclamation to come into force on Saturday, September 7.   At the same time a separate demand was being made on the Wholesale Society for new rates of pay in respect, in the first * instance, of men em ployed at Longsight printing works, which-has since developed into a sympathetic strike.   It appears that the threat of a proclamation of the York-shire retail strike led the Union to concentrate on the separate dispute with the Wholesale Society, and to issue a demand to their members in all retail societies to refuse to handle the goods of the Wholesale Society.   The result of this is obviously to widen the range of the threatened strike to an alarming extent.   If the strike became effective, ten million registered customers of co-operative societies would have to go elsewhere for their goods and the consequent dislocation would seriously embarrass the Ministry of Food.   The Trades Union Congress at Derby have passed a resolution condemning the action of the A.U.C.E. and approving the attitude taken up by the Co-operative Wholesale Society.A difficulty of some importance affecting food administration in Scotland arises from, the action taken by the Scottish Federation of Grocers and Provision Merchants, in recommending their members to decline to send in the returns required from retailers, and the coupons evidencing the sale of sugar. The Inverness Burgh Food Control Committee has taken action against certain grocers, who have acted upon this recommendation, amongst them the President of the Local Grocers Association, who protests strongly against a local prosecution, stating that the question is a national one, and that local action will precipitate a crisis in food distribution.A  (33)6467-1   Pk 1   135  9/18  E &amp; S
2A meeting of the Agricultural Council was held on September 3, Sir Charles Bathurst in the chair.Mr. Wise presented a report on actual and prospective supplies of feeding-stuffs, and a discussion ensued on minimum rations and tho effect on meat and milk supplies in the event of a severe shortage of imports. Major Astor emphasised the difficulties with regard to the importation of adequate supplies. In reply to a suggestion that linseed and cotton cake and other feeding-stuffs should be released forthwith for dairy stock and lambs, it was pointed out that the total quantity of cake stored by the Ministry did not exceed 60,000 tons, of which only about 4,000 tons was linseed and less than 20,000 tons cotton cake. It was, therefore, impossible to distribute anything beyond the ration already available for milking-cows.Mr. Leslie Scott raised the question of control of milk distribution, and demanded \ that before any scheme was adopted it should be referred to the Council.   A sub-committee was appointed to discuss winter milk prices with a sub-committee of the Consumers&apos; Council.The following nominations of representatives of Irish agricultural interests were received from the Irish Department of Agriculture and approved: Mr. Robert Downs, Mr. N. J. Dunn, M.P., Col. Sir N. T. Everard, Bart., Mr. George Monaghan, Mr. II. T. Barrie, M.P., Mr. R. A. Anderson, and Mr. W. MacDonald.It was unanimously resolved to recommend that the Potato Purchase Scheme be re-considered by the Ministry of Food.On Friday, August 30th, Mr. Clynes met Mr. Tom Richards, M.P., and Mr. Winstone, of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, and heard from them a statement of the complaints being made of the shortage of food in the South Wales coalfield. He arranged that Captain S. G. Tallents and Mr. T. G. Jones should visit South Wales immediately. Captain Tallents held enquiries at Abersychan, Abertillery, Ebbw Vale and Porth, on September 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, when representatives of the Food Control Committees, the miners, steel workers, and food retailers explained their difficulties with clearness and moderation. They said that they could not maintain the output unless they were &quot;better fed. In effect, their request took the form of a demand for additional rations for heavy workers, complaints of distribution schemes based on a datum period, and a demand for food of better quality.The cheese supply came in for the severest criticism. It was urged that jam distribution was very unequal, and that the South Wales valleys did not get their fair share. The meetings asked for more butter, more condensed milk, better bread and better meat. The proceedings everywhere were of the most friendly character, and it is hoped that if measures are taken to remedy certain inequalities disclosed by the enquiry, existing difficulties can be removed.- A meeting of the Food Council was held on Friday, August 30th, at the Ministry of Food. Mr. Clynes presided. M. Vilgrain (France), Mr. Cotton (U.S.A.), and Professor Attolico (Italy), attended. Certain decisions were taken with a view to facilitating the work of the Committee of Representatives.A meeting of the Committee of Representatives was held on 3rd September. The programme of importation for the cereal year, 1918-19, has been further discussed with the Allied Maritime Transport Council. -Orders under Defence of the Realai Regulations.(1) An Order amending the Jam Prices Order No. 2, 1918, dated 26th August, 1918, fixes new wholesale and retail prices for jams and jellies, and several new varieties of jam have been added to the schedules. The prices shoAV an advance of \\d. to 3d. a lb. on those hitherto in force.(2) The Rats Order, 1918, dated 28th August, 1918, gives power to the local authorities to take such measures as may appear necessary .to them with regard to the destruction of rats, and requires any persons concerned to comply with any directions given by such authorities. 1(3) The Beans, Peas, and Pulse Requisition (Amendment) Order, 1918, dated 30th August, 1918, exempts from the Requisitioning Order of 1917, beans and peas imported for seed, and requires certain returns to be furnished.
3103(4) Order amending the Poultry and Game (Prices) Order 1918, dated 30th August 1918, fixes prices for partridges and pheasants. The wholesale price for partridgas hatched in 1918 will be 3s. M., and the retail price 4s. For other partridges, wholesale Is. 9cZ., retail 2s. 3d. For cock pheasants, wholesale 5s. ftd., retail 7s., and for hen birds, 5s. and 6s. Qd. respectively. The Order sanctions the sale of poultry or game other than by weight, so long as the maximum price is not exceeded.(5) The Vegetable Marrow Order, 1918, dated. 31st August, 1918, fixes maximum prices for growers, wholesale dealers and retailers. Jam manufacturers may buy for jam, in priority to any other purchase, any vegetable marrows in the hands of groweis or wholesale dealers, on tendering the maximum price. The Order cancels contracts above the maximum price. It does not apply to cooked, preserved or custard marrows, nor to Ireland.(6) The Grain (Prices) Order, 1918, dated 31 st August, 1918, embodies the maximum prices authorised by the Home Affairs Committee of the War Cabinet to whom the matter had been referred by the President of the Board of Agriculture. The prescribed prices are those put forward by the Food Controller, except that the scale of wheat prices is varied in favour of early threshing, but this variation does not affect the average price fixed for wheat.(7) By the Canned Meat (Requisition) Order, 1918, dated 31st August, 1918, the Food Controller took possession of the stocks of canned meat in the United Kingdom of the sizes specified in the Order. The Order does not apply to holders of 100 cases or less. The cost of the meat thus requisitioned is estimated to amount to 2,250,000L, for which Treasury sanction is obtained, but it is hoped to make a considerable profit to the Ministry on the transaction, either by bargaining with the holders for Jprices less than the maximum, or, if necessary, by slightly increasing the existing maximum prices. The Order was made necessary by the. decision of the Inter-Allied Food Council to restrict the consumption of canned meats in the United Kingdom to 2,000 tons a month, i.e., about one-fourth of the 1.917 consumption.(8) The Grocery Syrup (Distribution to Manufacturers) Order, 1918, dated August 31st, 1918, provides that on and after October 6th, no person may obtain supplies of grocery syrup for manufacturing purposes except under licence of the Ministry of Food or a Food Control Committee.(9j The Canned Salmon (Requisition) Order, 1918, dated September 2nd, 1918, , requires all canned salmon that may arrive in the United Kingdom from Canada and the U.S.A. to be placed at the disposal of the Food Controller, and prohibits anyone in the United Kingdom from dealing in canned salmon lying in Canada or the U.S.A. The Ministry of Food is prepared, on certain conditions, to purchase canned salmon already paid for by traders in the United Kingdom.Supplies and Prices.-Butter. The total quantity of butter afloat on August 31st was 1,715 tons, while the stocks in hand are 9,419 tons.Cheese. Owing to more favourable shipping arrangements, the position with regard to the supply of cheese from Australasia has been much improved, andHhe outlook, for the future is favourable. The Canadian cheese coming forward is also well up to what was estimated ; a large quantity of this is being shipped direct to France, 1,356 tons-having already arrived in that country. Though the supply of cheese from the United States of America has materially diminished, the position at the present time is satisfactory, and will remain so if increased shipments are made towards the end of the year. It is not yet known whether shipping space will be available for 300 tons of cheese awaiting shipment in South Africa.A distribution on a 100 per cent, basis was made on the 26th August, but, owing to the time taken in transit, a short period must necessarily always elapse before cheese that has been distributed is obtainable by the public.Cocoa. 2,227 tons of raw cocoa have arrived from West Africa, and a further 400 tons from West Africa and 800 tons from the West Indies are in transit. The bulk of this should be available for the first allocation under the distribution scheme on the 12th September, and is urgently required in view of manufacturers&apos; shortage of Accra cocoa.-Dried Fruits. 2,057 tons of natural Californian re-cleaned sultanas have been purchased for the Ministry of Food in the United States.
4Feeding Stuffs. The question of the supply of cattle feeding-stuffs that will be available for the winter, and the boat methods of rationing them, is engaging the urgent attention of the, Ministry. The quantity available depends entirely on the amount of tonnage that can be allotted to this purpose by the Inter-Allied Maritime Council, and the vital importance to the agricultural community of securing the maximum supply of feeding-stuffs consistent with the paramount necessity of soldiers in France has been pressed by the Ministry of Food and the three Agricultural Departments. It is practically certain that in any event the supply of feeding-stuffs will be short this winter. That being the case, it will be necessary to put into operation a scheme of rationing&apos;out the available supplies, so as to secure that on the one hand there is equitable distribution and on the other the country gets back in food the fullest possible return from the shipping devoted to the import of feeding-stuffs. It is hoped that some supplies of cake will be available for fattening purposes for cattle to be slaughtered during the early months of next year. The quantity cannot at present be stated, but it is intended to distribute the supplies only to farmers who undertake to bring forward cattle in the required months. Arrange-ments have been made for 100,000 tons of cattle cake and meals to be purchased from America, and it is hoped to arrange for larger quantities in the near future.Meat. -The supplies of live stock to the various markets continue to be affected adversely by the harvest demands upon labour. It is satisfactory to record that a larger proportion than heretofore of the home supplies has been successfully diverted to the Metropolitan area. There is still a certain amount of inequality in distribution, as it is impossible to deprive the producing areas of such a quantity of home-grown meat as would ensure absolute equality, and in this respect Southern counties have suffered most. Recent complaints of distribution chiefly arise from the continued aversion to foreign meat in the districts unaccustomed to its use. There is still a disposition to dispense with part of the authorised ration rather than take a portion of the supplies in this form, but a reduction in the total quantity allowed is imminent and will probably come into effect on September 22nd.Enforcement of Orders.The number of prosecutions for the week is as follows : --	Prosecutions.	Successful.	Percentage.England, Scotland and Wales   -         -         -Ireland -	439 304	400 242	91-1 79-6The average fine for England, Scotland and Wales was \l. 16s. 2d., and for Ireland 9s. 3d. Both figures indicate a material increase on those for the previous week.At Old Street Police Court a butcher was fined 25L for selling meat to an unregistered customer and 721. for not detaching a sufficient number of coupons. He was also ordered to pay five guineas costs. It was found on examining the defendants returns for several months that there was a deficiency of about 1,000 coupons.In Bishop Auckland a butcher was fined 401 for killing ungraded cattle. He had been cautioned three times previously, and the local committee has decided to withdraw his licence as butcher, which will result in his September buying permit being withdrawn.Two cases in which decisions on legal points were given against the Ministry may be mentioned. In the first, the defendant who admitted retailing milk for a period at Id. per quart, whereas the fixed price was 6oi per quart, was discharged on the ground that specific dates for breaches of the Orders should have been given. In the,second, a summons against a farmer for selling cheese above the maximum price was dismissed, on the ground that the farmer&apos;s daughter had sold the cheese, and that the defendant was not responsible.
1045PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.       v&apos; -   anImports.Owing to a marked improvement during the last week of the month imports of food during August were on the aggregate noticeably above those in July. Of the principal groups only meat was lower. Cereals, meat, lard, and tea were all higher than anticipated at the beginning of the month. The loss of a large cargo brought down the total for sugar below estimate. Cheese was unsatisfactory. The entry for August 1918 under butter, margarine, and lard in the table below consists almost wholly of lard ; no margarine, and less than 1,000 tons of butter for the month are included. Compared with August 1917 cereals were heavily down, but meat, fats, sugar, and tea were up : Average Weekly Imports.&apos;.-f i&apos;Uf&apos;,1   Date. .. ,	Cereals.

The total was for the first time since June 1st well above that of a year before. Nearly all the items contributed to the increase.Not for many weeks have arrivals of wheat and flour been sufficient to meet current consumption, as was approximately the case this week when the two together in equivalent grain rose to 105,700 tons. Rice at 6,300 tons was higher, but other cereals fell from 40,600 tons to 26,400 tons. All kinds of meat improved: bacon and hams rose from 5,700 tons to 13,900 tons ; beef from 4,300 tons to 9,800 tons ; mutton from 400 tons to 4,100 tons ; unspecified meat from 3,400 tons to 4,700 tons. Total supplies were 18,800 tons higher than the previous week, 11,000 tons higher than a year ago.Imports of condensed milk and lard were the largest for any week since the outbreak of war. Cheese was much higher than in the previous week, but barely up to the average of recent, months.   Butter has again fallen to less than 100 tons.Sugar rose from 54,500 tons to 59,700 tons. Imports during August have only just failed to secure the 15 weeks&apos; reserve with which it was hoped to commence the new cereal year.   Cocoa imports were the highest since the end of March.Consumption.Meat. The week ended August 24th saw a decided increase in the number of stock passing through the markets (Table C). Cattle rose 8 per cent., sheep 12 per cent. The large proportion of lambs, however, reduces the total weight of mutton yielded. Issues of frozen meat also fell off by 1,200 tons from the level of the preceding week.The month of July for which revised figures of slaughter (Table D) and of con-sumption (Table B) are now given, showed a remarkable increase in the supply of home-fed meat on that of June. This was partly due to the drought in the early part of the month which forced animals into the markets in poor condition earlier than had been anticipated. The resulting total supply of home-fed meat for the United Kingdom was 62,300 tons as against 48,400 tons for June. On the other hand, issues of frozen meat fell by 3,200 tons. The net result was an increase of 10,700 tons on the total supply for June, thus making the level of consumption in July the highest recorded this year.Flour. Consumption of flour by the principal biscuit manufacturers for the four weeks to August 17th was, in the aggregate, 8 per cent, less than for the previous four weeks, and 10 per cent, less than for the corresponding period a year ago.

Average weekly supplies of fish at Billingsgate Market during August were the highest since March, and amounted to 2,537 tons, an increase of 10G tons, or 4 per cent, on July, and of 164 tons, or 7 per cent, on August 1917.Milk. The fall in the supply of milk to the larger towns, as represented by the milk index numbers (Table E), has been stayed, probably only temporarily. During the last two weeks the index has risen two points, to 104-g-.
