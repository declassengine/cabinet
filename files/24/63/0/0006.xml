Bulgaria. /003.MEMORANDUMonTHE TURC0-BU.LG ARIAN BOUNDARY DISPUTE.1. The Settlement of 1915.IN the summer of 1915 the Turco-Bulgarian frontier delimited in Thrace in 1913, after the Turkish inoccupation of Adrianople, was &quot; rectified&quot; by agreement under German auspices as one of the conditions on which Bulgaria intervened on the side of the Central Powers. It was boasted in Germany at the time that this Turco-Bulgarian settlement was as final as that between Prussia and Austria in 1866. The course of the war, however, has already cast doubts upon the finality of both settle-ments, and the Turco-Bulgarian problem was formally reopened this spring in the negotiations preceding the Peace of Bucarest.2. Reasons for Turkish Dissatisfaction.The arrangement of 1915 was unsatisfactory to Turkey for the following reasons : (a.) It practically partitioned Adrianople,* and left the main part of the city on the left bank of the Maritsa (which the Turks still retained) incapable of defence. The possession of Adrianople, both as a shrine and as a fortress, has been bound up since the Balkan war with Turkish national feeling and wilh the prestige of the O.U.P.(6.) It meant a final renunciation of the Turkish and Moslem-Bulgar population of Western Thrace, already abandoned by the treaty of 1913. This population had protested against annexation to Bulgaria in 1913, &apos;3nd had become a Turkish national irredenta.(c.) The Turkish official class had not reconciled themselves to the loss of their other European provinces, and were prepared to reclaim any of these on the first opportunity, on grounds of &quot;restoration of integrity&quot; or &quot; disannex-ation.&quot; This claim contained the most serious possibilities of disagreement with Bulgaria, because it was unlimited.Bulgaria, on her side, regarded the 1915 arrangement as the minimum consistent with her interests. Bulgaria needs an outlet to.the iEgean, and the only possible outlet, geographically-at any rate for Eastern Bulgaria is the valley of the Maritsa.t By the Treaty of London in 1913 Bulgaria secured this outlet by advancing her south-eastern frontier to the Enos-Midia line. By the convention with Turkey, following on the Treaty of Bucarest later in the same year, she was compelled to accept a line which closed it altogether. The line of 1915 (the whole right bank of the Maritsa, and a strip 1 kilom. broad along the left bank also, from a point below Adrianople) is almost the least that will give her this outlet at all.3. The Reopening of the Question at Bucarest (1918).The Turks found their opportunity of reopening the Thracian question in the recent peace negotiations with Rumania,They claimed that the prospective acquisition of the whole Dobrogea by Bulgaria was (a) partly due to the Turkish troops which had taken part in the Dobrogea catn-paign, and (6) a consequence of the war between the Quadruple Allianqe and Rumania* Assigning- to Bulgaria the suburb of Karagach and the railway station on the right bank of the river, f &quot;We are keen on our acquisition of territory along the Maritsa because it secures to us the only possible outlet of South and Bast Bulgaria to the iEgean.&quot;  (&quot; Preporets,&quot; 7th June, 1018.)
 an event not foreseen when the arrangement of 1915 was made.* The situation was therefore altered, and Turkey could only agree to the assignment of the whole Dobrogea to Bulgaria on condition of receiving such compensation from Bulgaria in Thrace as to preserve the &quot; balance of power in the Balkans.&quot;Moreover, the Turks claimed that, on this principle of a Balkan balance, the compensation demanded in respect of Dobrogea could not be final, and that further demands must be marie if Bulgaria obtained unforeseen annexations in other directions.The Bulgars contended that the arrangement of 1915 was the unalterable &quot;condition on which Bulgaria abandoned her traditional policy towards Turkey,&quot; t and could not be invalidated by subsequent events. But, apart from their treaty rights, they denied that there was any intrinsic&apos;reasonableness in the Turkish claims. As regards the Turkish troops, they maintained (a) that they were sent in lieu of German troops due under a Bulgar-German military convention, and therefore Turkey&apos;s claim to compensation, if any, lay not against Bulgaria but against Germany; and (6) that the Dobrogea campaign was in defence of Turkey in Europe as well as of Bulgaria. They rejected the principle of a &quot; balance of power in the Balkans.&quot; It had been recognised by Bulgaria&apos;s allies that her war aim was national unification; she did not owe compensation to any of them for carrying it out. Bulgaria did not object to Turkish aims of Turanian or Islamic unity, and to the (much greater) Turkish aggrandise-ment involved in them.   Let Bulgarian aims be respected by Turkey.JThe Bulgars were further exasperated by the Turkish contingent claim for addi-tional compensation in the case of other Bulgarian acquisitions.Turkey must have formulated her claims to her allies some time between the armistice with Rumania (9th December, 1917) and the signing of the preliminary peace with her (5th March, 1918). It is certain that for some, though not all of them, she received German support, and her claims were recognised in principle by the provi-sion in the Bucarest Treaty retaining Northern Dobrogea (as far south as and including the Cernavoda-Constanta Railway) under a condominium of the four Powers until certain questions between Bulgaria and the other three had been settled. Of these, the question of Turkish compensation was the most important, and it is rumoured that when Talaat went to Berlin (presumably during the negotiations with Russia and Rumania) he received a written promise from the German Government that Northern Dobrogea should not be handed over to Bulgaria until the Turkish claim for compensa-tion had been met.4; The Proposed Solutions.The actual terms of revision suggested at different moments by different parties dannot, of course, be accurately known. Such accounts as we have are almost entirely rumours from confidential sources, and the following summaries are merely conjectures based on a comparison of these(a.) Von Kiihlmann&apos;s Proposal: j$ Bulgaria, in compensation for the acquisition of the whole of Dobrogea by herself, to cede to Turkey Karagach and a. strip of territory on the right bank of the Maritsa below it, up to and including Kuleli Burgas.(This Avould give Turkey an integral Adrianople, and railway communications with it through her own territory. (By the 1915 agreement Bulgaria was to pay for the construction of a line to Adrianople through Turkish territory east of the Maritsa.) At the same time, Bulgaria could easily restore railway communication with the iEgean through her own territory by buildir^g a loop-line from a point above Karagach to Dhimotika, in the low country still left between the rectified frontier and Ehodope.)Whether or not Radoslavov would have agreed to this proposal, on condition that the question should then be closed, is immaterial, because the Turks have never shown themselves Willing to content themselves with merely restoring the strategic security of Adrianople.(b.) The Turkish Proposal: If Bulgaria receives the Dobrogea only, the Turco-Bulgar frontier to be restored as it was from 1913 to 1915. (N.B. This gives Turkey considerably more than Von Kublmann&apos;s proposal, and makes the construction of a Bulgarian loop line more difficult.) If Bulgaria receives the Morava district also, Turkey to receive Western Thrace up to the Kara Su (Mesta).* According to certain Bulgarian informants, Bulgaria was, by the agreement of 1915, promised Dobrogea in the event of Rumania attacking the Central Powers, in return for Bulgarian assistance to the latter.&apos; But this&apos; statement is&apos; in no sense&apos; proved.t &quot; Preporets,&quot; 19th April, 1918.I &quot;Preporets,&quot; 16th April, 1918&apos;.g &quot; Tagliche Rundschau,&quot; 30th April, 1918;
Confidential Turkish sources were reporting at the beginning of April that Bulgaria agreed to this; and there was even one report that an agreement ceding Turkey the Kara Su line had actually been signed, with the stipulation that Bulgaria should receive not only the Morava district, but Greek Macedonia east of the Struma. These reports were unquestionably false.Another version, from a Bulgarian source, is that Turkey demanded the Kara Su line as compensation for Bulgaria acquiring the Morava district, but if Bulgaria received Greek Eastern Macedonia too, then Turkey would increase her claims still further.(c.) The Austrian Proposal: Bulgaria to cede to Turkey the territory she received from her in 1915, and also Dede Agach and Giimiiljina. But the rest of Western Thrace to remain Bulgarian, and Bulgaria to be quit ol all further cessions in compensation for acquiring either Dobrogea or other territories elsewhere.This compromise seems to have been unacceptable to both parties; but there appears to be an impression in Turkish official circles that Austria favours Bulgaria, just as Germany does Turkey.(d.) The Arbitration Proposal: In April it was reported that Helfferich was coming to Sofia and Constantinople to arbitrate, and there was another report in June of a conference to be called in Berlin.This proposal seems to have broken down over Turkey&apos;s contingent claim to the Kara Su line.(e.) The Bulgarian Counter-Proposal: Some time in April Bulgaria appears to have suggested that she might accept Turkey&apos;s claim to the Kara Su line if she herself received not only the Morava district and Eastern Macedonia, but Saloniki, and were assisted militarily in an offensive against Saloniki by her allies.Since Bulgaria knew that Germany was averse from an offensive against Saloniki on account of her Greek policy, it is likely that the proposal was not sincere, but was rather a manoeuvre intended to warn Germany of possible complications in which she might be involved by continuing to support the Turkish claim.5. The Bulgarian Attitude.Ptadoslavov may just conceivably have been willing to make the minimum conces-sion [i.e. that proposed by von Kiihlmann) in return for being quit of all further Turkish, claims; but it is clear that neither he or any other Bulgarian party has contemplated yielding to the wider Turkish claims (which, unless Bulgaria at the same time obtained Eastern Macedonia, would cut her off altogether from the iEgean coast).Whether Iiadoslavov remained willing to make even the minimum concession, in face of the growing Turkish demands and the growing public opposition in Bulgaria, is riot certain. According to one report, he, as well as the opposition, was opposed to any concession whatever. At any rate, there is no doubt about the policy of M. Malinov, who was asked to form a Cabinet on the 16th June. In an interview given within a month of his appointment to the Sofia correspondent of the &quot; Vossische Zeitung,&quot; he called &quot; the controversy with Turkey in regard to Dobrogea and the strip of territory on the Maritsa&quot; [no mention of the Kara Su line] &quot; a misunderstanding,&quot; and added: &quot;There is no question of discussing whether our possession of Dobrogea in anyway entitles the Turks to compensation.   The Turks cannot expect us to follow their policyin this connection any further.....Turkey&apos;s best protection in the North is not anew fortress of Adrianople, but a strong and loyal Bulgaria.&quot;Considering that the principle of compensation for Turkey had been recognised implicitly by the four Powers in the establishment of a provisional condominium over Northern Dobrogea, this was a very provocative statement for a Bulgarian premier to make.6. The Campaign in the Press.The rumour of the Turkish demands, which was confirmed when the terms of the the Rumanian Treaty establishing the condominium in Northern Dobrogea were published, gave rise about February to a violent anti-Turkish campaign in the Bulgarian press, which reached its height in April and has continued unabated.For four months the Turkish press made no reply, and since it was at that time under a rigid censorship, this silence evidently represented the policy of the Govern-ment. Presumably they were confident of Germany&apos;s intention and ability to secure them their demands, and, as the aggressors, thought it undesirable tof offend Bulgaria more than she must necessarily be offended by having to yield in fact to Turkey under German pressure.
But on the 10th June the Turkish censorship was suddenly relaxed.There were, of course, other motives too behind this measure. The Constantinople press itself had for some time -been agitating for greater freedom, and the chief object of the Government was probably to bring pressure to bear on Germany by a press campaign on the future of the Crimea, the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and Turkish influence in the Caucasus-all questions over which both the Government and public opinion were as much exercised as over the difference with Bulgaria. Still, it is perhaps significant that the step was taken at a moment when Radoslavov had just resigned, and the likelihood of a Malinov Government was known at Constan-tinople. And a counter-campaign against Bulgaria in the Turkish press was one of the first results.Both presses compared the situation with that of 1913 the Bulgars hinting that they were once more being betrayed by their allies, and the Turks threatening more openly that, if Bulgaria were as grasping now as then, she would be in danger of a second &quot; war after the Avar &apos;&apos; against a coalition of ail her neighbours.On the 21st June the Sofia &quot; Kambana &quot; quoted an article by Hussein Jahid, a fairly prominent C.U.P. politician, threatening that if Bulgaria did not yield amicably now to Turkey&apos;s demands, Turkey would make an alliance after the war with Rumania, Serbia, and Greece, and obtain them by force. Talaat himself was actually reported in July to have used the same threats in conversation with a Bulgarian representative at Constantinople.7. Resentment against Germany.The official attitude of the German Government was indicated in a speech by Von Kuhlmann in the Reichstag, on the 21st June,* the very day of Malinovs accession to power, and ten days after the relaxation of the Turkish censorship had made the controversy more critical.   His main points were these : (a.) Northern Dobrogea must ultimately revert to Bulgaria. (6.) The Turks have a claim to compensation.(c.) &quot; Being bound by exactly equal ties to our two allies, Bulgaria and Turkey, we must carefully avoid everything that could give the impression abroad that German policy and the substantial factors of German public life favoured the wishes and claims of one at the expense of the other.&quot;It is noticeable that both parties resent what they consider an evasion of respon-sibility on Germany&apos;s part. . &quot;The Central Powers know that the agreement of 1915 remains the basis of the alliance, and it is for them to speak out. This is not a question between ourselves and the Turks, but a question concerning all the Allies.&quot; (&quot; Mir,&quot; 25th April.)In its previous issue the same paper had attacked an article in the &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,&quot; which was also criticised by its German contemporaries for being too partial to the Turkish point of view. But the same article appears to have been attacked, as casting doubts on Turkey&apos;s loyalty to the alliance, by the Constantinople &quot; Tasvir-i-Evkiar &quot; ; and the &quot; Osmanische Lloyd &quot; (the German daily at Constantinople), which, after the relaxation of the censorship, joined its Turkish contemporaries in admonishing; Bulgaria, was driven after a few days into a defence of the &quot; Nord-deutsche &quot; against the &quot; Tasvirs &quot; attack. Confidential sources also imply that Turkish official circles mistrust Germany&apos;s sincerity towards them, although the)r have been assured of her official support.8. Reports of Hostile Action between Turkey and Bulgaria.It was rumoured in May that there had been anti-Turkish riots in Sofia; in July that the Bulgars were detaining military stores in transit from Central Europe to Turkey; and, later again, that there had been fighting on the frontier,! or taa^ a German garrison had been sent to Adrianople to prevent fighting from taking place. These sensational stories must be received with scepticism.There is more interest in a report, dating from March, that the Moslem deputies for Western Thrace had made an interpellation in the Sabraniye, declaring that the Bulgarian Government treated them not as brothers but as enemies.   This incident is* See &quot; Times,&quot; 26th June, t Report from Rome in &quot; Observer,&quot; 28th July, 1918.
said to have caused indignation among all Bulgarian parties, and to have been attributed to Turkish propaganda.Another report states that, at a meeting of the 0. LI. P., held about the 12th April, some members suggested sending the Turkish First Army to Adrianople, but that Talaat, though expressing himself violently against Bulgaria, represented this as unnecessary in view of Germany&apos;s diplomatic support.9. Effects on Bulgarian Opinion.The sum total of the effect of this eight months&apos; controversy on Bulgarian opinion may be viewed under three aspects : (a.) Bulgarian internal politics ;(6.) Bulgaria&apos;s attitude towards Turkey ; .(c.) Germano-Bulgarian relations.(a.) The feeling aroused in Bulgaria by the idea that Bulgaria had been blackmailed by her allies over the Dobrogean question was in part responsible, and was very largely the ostensible cause for the dismissal of the Radoslavov Government, and its replacement by Malinov.Malinov has categorically declared himself, both in public pronouncements and in press interviews/ as determined to secure the whole of Dobrogea to Bulgaria, and as equally determined not to give up a square inch of the Thracian territory ceded by Turkey in 1915. From the point of view of Bulgarian territorial aspirations Malinqv, therefore, poses as a far sounder patriot than Radoslavov. It is hard to say how far his contentions with regard to Dobrogea are shared by the bulk of the Bulgarian nation. Certainly every party and colour of politician, except certain Revolutionary Socialists, are favourable to the annexation of the whole of Dobrogea to Bulgaria. Bulgarian propagandists have concentrated their efforts on explaining both to the German and Entente publics that Dobrogea, like the Morava Valley, is really Bulgarian country. The activities of the &quot; Dobrudzha Society,&quot; and the favour openly shown to it by the Bulgarian Government are a striking witness of their determination to secure the province by one means or another, either by force or fraud. Their failure to secure unqualified German support for their demands means that their activities will be turned on to the publication of books and articles designed to persuade the Entente of the justice of their claim, and to subterranean intrigues considered likely to win Entente opinion to their side over it.How far the ordinary Bulgarian is prepared to make sacrifices for the annexation of the whole of Dobrogea it is hard to say. Certain Bulgarian revolutionary elements in Switzerland informed our agents that they would be content with the restitution of tlie pre-1913 frontier. As to this, under certain circumstances, given an equitable settlement of South-Eastern Europe as a whole, it is not likely that any insuperable difficulties with Rumania would arise, as the two departments of Silistra and Dobrich are not vital to Rumania either racially,.economically, or strategically.&apos; To sum up : The effect of the quarrel over Dobrogea in Bulgaria may have been to discredit finally the most directly pro-German party among the Bulgars, that of Radoslavov and his supporters. But in itself that is of little advantage to us, as the Malinov Government has come into power with ostensibly a more chauvinistic programme than its predecessor.(6.) A more valuable result from our point of view is that the quarrel has directed the hostile attention of the Bulgars just in the direction which we wished. Even with so practical and realistic a nation as the Bulgarians, national sentiment is not altogether to be discounted, and the memories of 1876 and even 1912-13 do not, whatever Bulgarian policy during the last three years has been, allow them to regard the Turks with over-friendliness. The Bulgars are perhaps beginning to realise now that, under certain conditions, Turkey may be as dangerous to them hereafter as before the Balkan war i.e., if behind the ill-organised State that is their neighbour they are always to picture the strong hand of Germany. The elimination of Russia from the world war certainly removes the danger which they feared of a Russian control over them from Constantinople and the Straits. But if instead of that a Turkey under the complete control of the Central Powers is to menace them, they are not better but worse off. On the other hand, they are perfectly aware, even without assurances from us, that,. - .       -. i-;   .   t. ........-.   , ,     (.       .   , 1.;.* See section (5). Only a few days ago Malinov, interviewed by the &apos;; Deli Hirlap,&quot; declared again: &quot; The Maritsa question no longer exists for us. It was finally settled in 1915. In my opinion it must not be discussed or even referred to.&quot;[367-381 C   ,
could a new orientation be brought about in Bulgaria there would be no primd facie objections on the part of the Entente Powers to Bulgaria recouping herself for certain inevitable losses on the west and north by the recovery of Turkish territory up to the Enos-Midia line.This is a delicate subject for the Bulgarian press to treat; openly at present, but hints of the consciousness of it have appeared in certain papers. For instance, the &quot;Preporets &quot; (.11th May) reminds the Turks that Greece and her Allies are willing to give Bulgaria the Enos-Midia line. &quot; Preporets &quot; naturally disavows any wish for this, yet at the same time it thinks it worth while to mention the &quot; fact&quot; to the Turks.Whether the various stories alluded to above as to actual fighting between Bulgarian and Turkish soldiers in Adrianople and elsewhere are to be taken seriously at present is more than doubtful, for these stories come to us from the &quot; interested&quot; sources of the Bulgarian propaganda. But there is no reason to suppose that such incidents do not fre mentfy take place, and, though in themselves unimportant, they might under certain conditions be the basis for a valuable change in popular opinion. That the Bulgarian authorities, without committing themselves politically, are keeping their eyes open to the possibility of hostilities with Turkey seems to be confirmed by various reports.(c.) Most important of all is undoubtedly the effect of the quarrel on Bulgaro-German relations. The whole subject of present discontents in Bulgaria will be treated in another memorandum, but in this direct connection it maybe noted that the relations between Bulgaria and the Central Powers have indisputably been made much more critical by Germany&apos;s attitude over the Dobrogean and Thracian questions. In the first place, although the Central Powers may not have been pledged^ to hand over to Bulgaria Dobrogea, as they undoubtedly were to hand over Macedonia, and also, according to Bulgarian statements the Morava Valley and even Serres and Kavalla, Bulgarian opinion, inspired, whether in good faith or from ulterior motives, by the Bulgarian Government, had taken it for granted that Dobrogea was to be part of Bulgaria&apos;s reward. It was, therefore, a severe shock, if not to the politicians, at least to the people, to find that the Treaty of Bucarest did not realise these hopes. The vague anti-German sentiment, which for other reasons prevailed in Bulgaria, was much strengthened by the growing feeling that Germany could not, in fact, be relied on to keep her word. As &quot; Mir &quot; (16th July) writes : &quot; Are not the results obtained during these last four years due not only to military force, but also to the conviction that the Allies will loyally carry out the engagements they have entered into, and that there will be no treachery ? This is the belief which has strengthened the Bulgarian army and inspired the nation, in spite of the losses which it has suffered. If doubt should be allowed to undermine this moral structure, then we must admit that the least which might happen is that the cause of the alliance will be gravely impaired amongst us.&quot; And &quot; Preporets&quot; (22nd April) says: &quot;As regards territorial questions, we have a foretaste of the way in which they will be treated now that Dobrogea is ceded to the Allies before passing to us. We also know that all war expenses will be heaped on us. Now we understand the true meaning of German &apos; financial assistance.&apos; &quot;If Germanys promises are in fact mere &quot; scraps of paper,&quot; what is happening with regard to Dobrogea to-day might, in the event of a complete German victory, happen with regard to other territories ceded, to Bulgaria later on. Bulgarian opinion feels strongly that, with the exception of certain German politicians (among them Stresemann and Friedrich Naumann have both been mentioned), German policy is not only tempo-rarily but must inevitably be on the side of the Turks, who are considered of more value to Germany than is Bulgaria.To sum up : In the event of a German victory, Bulgarians now realise they will be treated as ruthlessly by Germany as suits German policy, and further, that a German victory is becoming more and more improbable, and that it is therefore necessary to look elsewhere for a guarantee for Bulgaria&apos;s security. Much as Bulgarians still hope to mislead Entente opinion as to their rights to the Rumanian, Serbian, and Greek territories they at present occupy, they cannot but be to some extent aware of the difficulties of succeeding in this direction. On the other hand, where the territories desired by Bulgaria are in the possession not of the Ententes Allies but of its enemy, Turkey, Bulgaria stands a far greater chance of receiving some recognition of her claims. Such a recognition would necessarily presuppose hostilities between Bulgaria and Turkey, and as such a state of things would be both in itself perfectly natural and most advantageous to our policy, it may be regarded as no small profit to us that the attitude of the Germans and Turks has provoked a bitter dispute with Bulgaria over the Dobrogean and Thracian questions.* But see sectiou 3.
10. Effects on the Enemy Alliance.On the whole, the controversy is unlikely by itself to produce catastrophic results, but in reopening the question Turkey has clearly committed a folly, and the enemy Alliance has been distinctly embarrassed by it. The Turco-Bulgar boundary dispute is indeed significant as one of a number of rifts in the alliance which have been opened wider instead of being closed by the arrangements made at Bucarest and Brest-Litovsk.In his interview with the :&apos; Deli Hirlap,&quot; Malinov has spoken of the condominium in Northern Dobrogea as &quot; the great mistake of diplomatists, which has had a depressing effect both on the Bulgarian people and at the front.&quot;&quot; People in Germany,&quot; as the1&quot; Hamburger Nachrichten &quot; puts it, &quot; should not take the matter lightly. A slight coolness, perhaps for a long time scarcely observable, a change in the standpoint from which it was the custom hitherto to view the alliance  at a given moment all this may have far-reaching consequences.&quot;In other words, if Germany&apos;s prospects of a victorious decision of the war dis-appear, this is one of the points at which the disintegration of her alliance may begin.o
