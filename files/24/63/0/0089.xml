LieMemorandum on questions that have arisen with the. Treasury and Ministry of National Service,bySir John Collie, M.D., CM.G. Director of Medical Services to the Ministry of Pensions.An accute difference of opinion involving an important question of principle has arisen between the Ministry of Pensions on ono side and the Treasury and the Ministry of National Service on the other.The Minister of Pensions is responsible both for the just assessment of pension and for securing such medical treatment as will restore to the utmost the man&apos;s earning&apos; capacity and thus reduce the financial liability of the State.This responsibility entails1,   Medical examination on invaliding from the ArmyS,   Medical, examination on re-survey of a condition al pension award.   - &apos;3.   Medical assistance for the Awarding Officers.4.   A Medical Staff at Headquarters.In my opinion this responsibility cannot be transferred to another department. I hold that it is my duty to insist upon controlling the work for which I am responsible and further that I am entitled to obtain such assistance from the departments whioh control expenditure and personnel  as will enable me to exercise this control, with due regard to economy of-   (a)   Public funds(b)   Medical personnel.. .     The view of the Treasury and the Ministry of National Service appears to be that if that Ministry consider   that they can undertake any of the medical work above mentioned, no proposal to carry it out under my control can be entertained.     I propose to illustrate this by a detailed consideration of the Medical Duties enumerated above.Medical Examination on Invaliding from IIavy and Army. This work with one important exception has always been carried out by the Naval and Military Authorities. The Admiralty and War Office are. primarily concerned with the question of invaliding, though the assessment oX the Disability with a view to pension award is undoubtedly a matter for this Ministry.   As however an examination by an independent Pensions Board would involve inconvenience and expense it has been agreed to accept the decisions of the Naval and Military Boards. No change in this procedure is contemplated.
0 rJ 9- 2The exception is that the Army Authorities found it necessary to appoint a Speoial Medical Board to deal with cases of neurasthenia and other functional nerve disorders. At the request of the War Office this Board was taken over&apos;-&apos; by the Minister of pensiens, arid,! am satisfied that this important work must remain urider/5mmediate control.   The increasing number of cases involves the extension of the Beard and probably 12 Boards will eventually be required throughout the Kingdom.(2)   Medical Examination on re-survey of a conditional pension award.This was, originally done by the Naval and Military Authorities, but it has now been agreed that it should be done by Civilian Boards.   The Ministry *f National Service wish to take over the whole of this du$y and the Treasury support them,   I do not approve of this in principle, but owing to representations as to the shortage of medical personnel and to the fact that the Ministry of National Service already had reoruiting boards established through-&apos; out the country, I am prepared to agree as a temporary measure so long as these conditions obtain, subject to the following stipulations:-(a) The Re-surveys of Neurasthenia etc must remain undermy control through the Special Medical Board above mentioned.(b) The Headquarters Board at Chelsea must remain under my control mainly to act as a training centre for doctors to be employed by the ministry of National Service in this work throughout the Kingdom, fox this purpose and to ensure economy it is necessary that the Board should have charge of allre-surveys in the London postal Area.These stipulations have led to an acute difference of opinion.   A conference was recently held to see whether the work could be handed over to the Ministry of National Service, with due regard to the interests of the State and the dis-charged man.   Negotiations were on the point of breaking down when the Ministry of National Service proposed that as regards Neurasthenia etc, the whole-time president of each National Service Board, that would deal with these oases, should be trained at the Special Medical Board under my control. This was agreed to tentatively but the result shows &apos; that the Ministry,of National Service entirely fail to realise the importance of this work, They propose to give their men three weeks training - 10 days at Haghull, two or three days in a Heart Hospital and the reasainder at the Speoial Medical Board., I have no hositation in saying that this is absolutely useless.The work is of the utmost importance, involving not only a correct pension award in an extremely difficult class of case, but also a recommendation for one of the special forms of treatment, which have been inaugurated by the Ministry of Pensions and have given most successful results, If this work were to be done by doctors who had not^ received adequate training the recovery of the men would be prejudiced and there would certainly be a long list of men awaiting a form of treatment not suited to their disability. Delay in obtaining&apos; suitable treatment has a permanent effect on the man&apos;s health and consequently on his pension award..,.For
For these reasons I consider that wo must Insist upon these stipulations and wish to be assured that I may retain this measure of control in my own hands *   This does not invo-lv^ any.waste of personnel, as the work done by my Boards will not have to be done bythe Ministry of Ntt ional Service.   Now will it entail undue expenditure if the principle is adopted of paying a fair salary for the class of work required.The Treasury and the Ministry of National Service are opposed to the principle of special boards as being(a) Unnecessary(b) Extravagant \((a) The policy which they supfctort is that every case should be examined by a general board with the assistance of a specialist When required to deal vrith disabilities of special organs or systems.   Cases of general difficulty (apart from those requiring a specialist1s opinion) are referred to a Consultant Board.I do not agree that this plan, however suitable it may be for grading recruits, Is satisfactory for dealing with assessments of pension and recommendations for treatment. In my opinion it Is far more satisfactory to have Special Boards to deal with special disabilities. .Questions of general difficulty involving reference to a Consultant Board, do not arise under this method as Is proved by the results of the special Medical Board for Functional Nerve Disorders.   For the present. I am only asking to be allowed to adopt this principle In the case of this Board and its branches.(b) The Treasury and the Ministry of National Service assert that members of ordinary Boards should only be paid  1.1,0. fcer session as against the  1.11.6. which we ask for partotime dootors employed on our Special Medical Board. The fee fixed by the Ministry of National Service for a specialist is  2.2.0, and for members of a Consultant Board  3.3.0, Under this arrangement the cost per session of a Board dealing with neurasthenic cases isj-3 members of General Board        3.3*0 &apos;  1 Specialist  2.2.0 5 * 5.00and in cases etf general difficulty      -r\-3 members of a Consultant Board  9.9.0Under my system the cost of boarding these oases is  4.14.6 for 3 members with no specialists called in and no Consultant Board.   As a fact howevor I claim that the men can be adequately examined by 2 doctors who have been trained In my methods.The cost therefore is only  3.3.0.Medical assistance for the Awarding Officers.   This has been authorised as a temporary measuro by the Treasury but again the test they propose is not whether the work is being well done under my control but whether the Consultant Boards which the Ministry of National Service propose to establish may not do away with the necessity for Assessors   I have already stated that if it is found that these Assessors have less work to do as time goes on their numbers will be reduced, though I laid stress on the importance of the Medical supervision of first awards, with which the Ministry of National Service are not concerned.   The Treasury however insist on reconsidering the question at the end of the current year in the light of experience.
v 4 &quot;Kodi c o,l st aff at HeadQuart ers,There is no conflict of opinion on this question.   The following cases are cited as instances of the deadlock which has heen reached owing to tho attitude of these twodepartments.m application for authority to pay for the time spent in travelling by part-time Doctors employed on the Special medical Boards dealing with neurasthenia   and other similar functional nerve, disorders.This wag-, at first, refused on the grounds that the Kir-is try- of National Service had not found it necessary to make payments of this nature to part-time doctors employed in that Ministry,   inquiries from the Ministry Of National Service elicited, the fact that this form of remuneration was shortly to &quot;be introduced by the Ministry of National Service and further representations were made. &apos; The application is now rejected by the Treasury in their letter dated the 9th August, 1918. Sir R. Chalmers states that after consultation with the Minister of National Service it is found that this payment is only made in exceptional cases of stress of work. He therefore declines to sanction the proposal on the ground that concessions refused by tne Department should not be granted to another Department,The fact that the application is made entirely on the grounds of stress of work is ignored.&apos; It has been fully explained that under my system 12 of these Boards will eventually he required to do this work throughout the Kingdom. When this total is reached, it will not be necessary,for part-time doctors to travel. At.present there is only/one Bfcard in London and four branches, So long as this is the case part-time doctors must be required to travel on occasions. .Salaries^ and ffees,&apos; to he paid to members of the Special -Me-dical Board or any of its branches mentioned above. In November 1917, the Treasury were- asked to sanction Salaries, of  750 per annum for whole-time doctors employed&apos;on &quot;the Board; (Thi s.proposal was subsequently modified by a request that the president of the Biard or any of the branches should be paid an allowance of  50 per annum in addition, to the. above salary) and Pees of  1.11,6 per session of 2-f- hours up to 4 sessions per week, and at  1,1,0. per session only, if an Officer were employed for. 3 whole days or more in any one-week.The above proposals were sanctioned on the 8th December 1912.   On the 22nd December we referred to the Treasury the question of ordinary   Resurvey Boards which the Army Council mished us to take over at an early date. It was proposed that these should be constituted on the lines of the Special hedical Board except that as regards salaries and fees the members should be paid at the rates in force for ordinary Boards under the Linistry of National Servioe, The Treasury asked us to agree to these Boards being conducted by the Ministry of National Service and we accepted this, though for reasons already stated I do not approve of the principle. In replying to this letter the Treasury noted with satisfaction that we agreed to allow ordinary re-surveys to he done by the Windstry of National Service and therefore raised no objection to our retaining the Head-quarters Board at Choi sea and the Special Medical Board on condition that the fees paid were the some as those paid to members of ordinary finistry of National Service Boards. Itwas -
was pointed out to thai that they had aLxtHtdy-sarKr1^u?Wi  1.11.6. per session far the Special Medical &quot;Board and tiu&amp;t^. we were acting on this &quot;decision. In spite of this in their \ latest letter dated the 13th June 1018, the Treasury now decline to sanction these proposals as the payments appear to be greater than those which would be made by t^e Ministry of National Service. As that Ministry is not required to undertake the difficult and important duties assigned to this Board and its branches, it is hardly reasonable to insist on a striot comparison. It should however be noted that both fees and salaries were arranged in consultation with the Ministry bt National Service and the allowance of  50 is loss than the allowances which are in faot paid by that kinistry to the presidents of ordinary National Service Boards, in addition to their salary of  750.III.   Appointment of Medical Consultants to the 2 Appeal Courts which are being established to deoide appeals against assessments of pensions.This question is still under consideration but in their most recent letter dated the 14th August 1918 the Treasury have refused sanction in view of the representations made by the Minister of National Service. I have asked for one whole-time Officer on  800 per annum and one part-time Officer to serve on the 2nd Court, which is designed to sit occasionally to deal with arrears, The Treasury are prepared to authorise a sessional payment of 1 guinea per session because this is the ordinary fee paid by the Ministry of National Service to doctors attending their Boards although the fee paid by th^fcMini stry to a member of a Consultant Board is 3 guineas per session.It had previously been pointed out that the Appeals Tribunal has to deal with cases which have been considered by me as Director of Medical Services of this Ministry and that consequently the services of a medical man of high standing must be secured if the decisions of the Tribunal are to inspire the requisite confidences, but so far the claim has been ignored because in totally different cir-cumstances the Ministry of National Service pay a lower fee.I should be- glad to receive a deoision on the important question of principle in order that the various questions at issue may be decided. The difficulty of obtaining competent doctors to carry out these duties is enhanced by the delay in obtaining authority for their remuneration. I am fully alive to the necessity of economising medical man-pewer to its fullest extent, and, I have given this question serious consideration, and have come to the conclusion that if the system which I propose is carried out, so far from reducing the effective medical man-power, it will tend to increase it inasmuch as the somewhat expensive Appeal Boards about to be established are less likely to&apos; be necessary, and this consideration is entirely apart from the very material monetary Baving caused by the more efficient medical decisions given by experienced Boards,(Signed) John Collie.26th August, 1918..
