^2/, *pp&quot;Uy fpht^f- JxjCff^^ of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1918. ji ^1    SECRET.THE 1914 AND GALLIPOLI STARS.Memoeandum by the Minister of Munitions.1. THE Government have decided to grant the 1914 Star to all British and Imperial troops serving in France before the 31st December, 1914. This applies not only to men who fought but to everybody on the lines of communications, including very large numbers who never were remotely in contact with danger. It excludes, however, all naval units who fought afloat in 1914. The naval operations of this period were very important. They comprised the seizure of the initiative at the outset of the war, the blocking of the enemy in his ports, and the clearance from the oceans by sinking or internment of all his surface vessels of every description. They included the action of the Heligoland Bight, the invaluable assistance given to the left flank of the army during the Battle of the Yser, and the decisive victory of the Falkland Islands, as well as a number of well-contested combats such as that resulting in the destruction of the &quot; Emden.&quot; Considering that the 1914 Star was mainly a gift to the pre-war army engaged in the field at the outset, a very good case could, in logic and in justice, be made out for a similar extension to the pre-war navy engaged afloat during the same period. But if this broad position is abandoned on account of the numbers involved, and the comparatively small proportion of casualties sustained by the navy as a whole, a second and more moderate arrangement could be made, namely, to give the 1914 Star to all naval units who actually came into action afloat during the period. By this definition is meant all ships who actually opened fire or who were fired upon. There would be no difficulty in picking these out. It would be necessary also to include the British submarines, which, although they cannot open fire, &quot; came into action &quot; when they entered the Heligoland Bight or approached the enemy&apos;s coasts. This, again, would raise no difficulties and affect only small numbers. At any rate, I wish to put on record my protest against the exclusion of the officers and men of the Royal Navy who were actually engaged in fighting in 1914-from the special reward which has been accorded to that year, while at the same time this reward is lavished on the host of persons who served on the lines of communications in France as far down as Havre and St. Nazaire. It would have been far better to restrict the issue of the 1914 Star to soldiers whose conditions of service are analogous to those which have usually been marked by a clasp, and to have excluded persons who have not been in any. danger. But as this has been settled and cannot be gone back upon, it certainly would be very wrong to exclude sailors who actually fought while including soldiers who did not fight.2. The position into which the Government have got over the Gallipoli Star is not, I think, a tenable one. To give a special Star to a large number of the troops who took part in the unparalleled feat of arms of landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in April 1915, and to deny this to the 29th Division, with whom the main honours rested, will certainly not be accepted as a sensible or fair decision. No troops have played a more honourable part than the 29th Division. The Anzacs themselves will be the first to resent their exclusion. Many of them, I am informed,. say they will refuse to wear the medal if their British comrades are excluded from it. Indeed, it becomes almost an insult to the Dominions concerned for us to say in effect: &quot; You can confer any trash you like on your own people, but the War Office are not going to debase their standards of honour by piling such things on to the British troops engaged.&quot; The capricious inci-dehce of the award as now proposed as between man and man is bound to give rise to a very large number of cases of keen individual dissatisfaction to which no logical answer can be given. For instance, General Birdwood, in virtue of the fact that he held an Australian commission as well as a British commission, would be entitled to the Anzac
tStar, but no single British officer serving with him on his staff, no matter what clanger they were in, would be entitled to share it. It is no use taking up a position in matters of this kind, from which later on one is sure to be driven. The object of medals, decorations, and awards of this kind is to give pleasure and promote contentment, and and to discriminate between men engaged in the same enterprise, facing the same dangers, suffering the same losses, and behaving with the same exemplary courage is only to expose the administration to unnecessary reproach. It may have been an unwise thing to agree to an Anzac Star, but from the moment that had been approved it was inevitable that it should be extended to all who took part in the episode for which the Star was awarded. There is no doubt that the original landing on the peninsula on the 25th April constituted a signal feat of arms, the name of which will never die, and all troops who participated in that landing should be treated equally. I say exactly the same with regard to the Naval units employed, though in this case I think the line should be drawn as to whether they came under fire or not. No one can doubt that in the original landing the troops achieved all that was humanly possible, and the blame of subsequent failure, if failure it was, does not rest with them.With regard to the other theatres, it is still open to decide whether special rewards, other than a local clasp, should be given, and there are serious arguments against giving any such rewards; but if any reward is given to any one class of troops engaged in an operation, it appears to me obvious that all the others similarly engaged must share in it. We ought not to underrate the amount of feeling which questions of this kind develop in the breasts of the fighting troops. What is intended to be a compliment, ill-applied, will become a source of perpetual irritation and offence.3. I therefore suggest (a.) That the 1914 Star should be extended to all Naval units which came into action in 1914 ; and(b.) That the Grallipoli Star should be given to all troops who landed on the peninsula, together with all Naval units who actually came under fire.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.September 3, 1918.
