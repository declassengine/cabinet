PrtOPAGAITDA 111Copy., tf letter from the secretary,  ner-y Propaganda Department, to Secretary, War Cabinet.Crowe Housu, Gurzon Street,i14th September, 1918.Sir,I am directed &quot;by Lord Uorthcliffe to convey the fello^in^ information to His Majesty&apos;s 7/ar Cabinet upon the working of the Department of Propaganda in Enemy Countries.From the outset this Department has based its activi-ties upon the essential connection between Allied War policy and propaganda.   From time to time it hag submitted for the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government suggestions in regard to the policy to be adopted in propaganda, and has been happy to receive a 1ar^e measure of official assent to them.   This course &quot;ill be followed in future whenever *hnn-res in the political situation seem to require any modi-fication of propaganda policy.   The most important step recent-ly taken in the direction of co-ordinating British Propaganda policy with that of Allied Governments was taken by the Inter-Allied Conference on propaganda in Enemy Countries which met at Crevre House cn August 14th last.   The rork of this Con-ference.is the subject of a separate report no\r before the War Cabinet.   The beneficial effects of its labours are already apparent in important directions.The ^ork cf the Department includes the preparation and distribution cf material in the shape of leaflets, pamphlets and books:   the supply of articles to neutral and enemy papers:   and the organisation of news services through neutral countries,   Leaflets for dropping over the German lines and behind them are prepared in large numbers.   By special arrangements for quick printing,- and for loading and transporting balloons, the Department has been instrumental in securing the rapid delivery in Prance cf a regular service of leaflets for aerial distribution within forty-eight hours of their being written.   As these leaflets contain for the most part news accompanied by maps, this speed in production is particularly advantageous.   A million and a quarter leaflets are now distributed weekly by balloons on the Western Front, and we hope very soon to increase this number considerably.   A large proportion of reoently-oaptured prisoners were found to have our leaflets in thejlr possession, and General Hindenbur^&apos;s recent manifesto proves that these leaflets also find their way from the trenches into the interior of Germany with marked effect.Methods of distribution are both military and civil. It has unfortunately not yet been possible to arrange with the Air Ministry for the dropping of leaflets by airmen on the Western Front.   Aeroplanes art, however, employed by us
and our Allies over the Austrian lines from Padua, which lo one of our chiof cent re 3 of distribution;   and at Oattaro arid other places on the South Eastern front in co-operation with the Admiralty. .   Arrangements have he en made to employ the same moans of distribution from Salonika against Bulgaria.This Department has always worked in close and friendly co-operation with all Departments of State and ec-pecially with the War Office and the Foreign off 100.    Its activities have steadily increased.     The Department has now t a icon over practically the whole production of X-ropganda for enemy countries with the exception of Turkey, but it naturally remains in close touch with tfcs War office and G.H.p. (France) i which ere so largely concerned in transport-in^ and distributing the matter prepared.The&apos;civilian agencies used i&apos;.i the secret dietribu-tion of pamphlets and the circulation of information are widely ramified.    Their influence in provoking Field Marshal Hindenburg&apos;9 recent outburst is indicated by the fact that the German Government has adopted drastic measures - which we have fortunately been able to circumvent - to check our work of distribution, especially across the Dutoh frontier.Special attention la paid in c*r.r pamphlets to tie economic issues involved in the war.     Treatment of these issues is found to influence enlivened German opinion more than any other form of propaganda.     The insertion of articles in neutral papers, especially in those German-Swiss and Scandinavian organs which are regularly read in Germany, has a useful effect.&apos;    A regular series of &quot;London Letters&quot; has boon started, written from an apparently pro--German point of view, but conveying disguised infoiraation as to the real state of affairs in this country.     This tends to counteract the stories which have been current in Germany about &quot;star-vat ion in England&quot;.     Correspondents in. neutral countries of enemy newspapers are successfully n;,&apos;ed&quot; with suitable inform-at ion.Use is regularly made of wireless telegraphy as a means of disseminating information, combating false German statements or suggestions and influencing opinion in Germany through neutral newspapers and pub!.:&quot;, a opinion.     In this connection wo have had the invaluable aid of tho Admiralty with foihich we maintain a close working arrangement.Mention should also be made rf the periodicals which arc being secretly prepareo. by t&apos;i is Department;   one  -for the German troops;   another for loyal inhabitants of Belgium; smuggled across the frontier from Holland;   a third for Bulgaria, printed in the Bulgarian language in Paris.We are now considering the production of a paper for prisoners of war *    A great deal of woric has been done in distributing books, pamphlets and newspapers in Prisoner of &quot;.&apos;ar Gamps in this country aid the work is being ex ton dec! to the camps in France.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,(Signed) H.iC.Hudson.Secretary, Enemy Propaganda Department,Lieut.
