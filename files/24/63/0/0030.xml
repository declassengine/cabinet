(1).4th September, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following report on the work of the Pood Production Department lor the week ended 3rd September, 1918:-The Weather and Condition of Crops. Harvesting was to some extent at a standstill during the first half of last week, owing to the break in the fine weather.  &apos;From Wednesday onward there was, however, a gradual clearing, and rapid progress with the harvest was again being made. No serious damage to standing corn is reported.   Roots are improving and grass keep is plentiful,   a good deal of breaking up of stubbles is already being done.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. The members of the Agricultural Executive Committees are at the present time largely occupied with the gathering of the harvest.Yorks. North Riding.   Moor House Parm, Scruton, has been cultivated by women under the Women&apos;s County War Agricultural Committee.   It was in a very neglected and foul state when possession was taken on 11th October, 1917, and up to May, 1918, when a male foreman was appointed, the entire work of the farm was done by woman labour. The Executive Committee report that the farm is now in a much improved state of cultivation and is in a condition to be let to a capable tenant.   They propose, with the agreement of the owner, to
withdraw from possession on October 11th., and the owner will thlet the farm to an approved tenant who will pay the Committee asfor a tenant right valuation.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Allotments - A large number of allotments in the Dover militaryhave been inspected, and suggestions given as to cropping andharvesting.     The crops are, without exception, in a healthy andclean condition;   extending over several miles, they are a verygood illustration of what can be done by care and perseverance eion the most inhospitable soil and exposed situation.The total area in 1918 Is 60 acres, and up to the presethe total yield is as followsi-Vegetable Marrows ...... 9,000 feonaPotatoes...............     198Cabbages &amp;c. (estimated)    600   &quot; Lettuce................10,000 heads.In addition there are over 300 pigs and 800 rabbits in Garrison, while 66 tons of hay have been collected.At Waterbeach (Cambs). a small parish with only 1,430 inhabitants comprising 255 householders, 67 acres of allotmentsi being cultivated, which approximates rather more than an averagea quarter of an acre to each household.   In addition to this, pi;....50% of the householders have large enough gardens to grow suffici vegetables for their own consumption.3*m* eei^it. Inspections of fruit plantations have been carried out Lingfield (Surrey,) amd Boreham (Chelmsford.   During the week 61 demonstrations in the preservation of fruit and vegetables have I1 carried out, while 7 exhibitions have been given in large towns. Owing to the shortage of the stone fru.it crops, most of&apos; the Itineraries fixed for the season have now ended, and the appoints; of the staff engaged for this purpose have gradually been termini
0 JMarketing - Dorset, A large and representative- meeting was held at Dorchester on the 28th ult., at which a special Marketing luceoutJve-of the horticultural Sub-Committee was formed, and there is every prospect that this county Will soon have a registered Society, Small Live Stock - Up to the present time eleven &quot;100 Doe&quot; Centres, fifty-three &quot;50 Loe&quot; Centres, and ninety &quot;20 Doe&quot; Centres have been formed.   About 1,500 rabbit leaflets have been dispatched, together with 470 copies of model rdles for rabbit clubs/TECHNICAL DIVISION. Hill Sheep Farming.   A report has been prepared of an enquiry held last spring with a view to determining the effects of the ploughing up programme upon hill sheep farming in this country.    The enquiry was made by two of the Department&apos;s Technical Advisers, assisted by a well-known Scotch sheep farmer, and a tour was arranged embracing some of the best known and most typical sheep districts in the north-west of England, Devonshire and Wales,   Forty-four farms were visited, and information collected aa regards the stock carrying capacity of the farms, and the yield of mutton and wool produced. The average output per acre of mutton and wool for the farms visited was found to be as follows:-vMutton produced.    Wool produced. &apos; (dead weight)&quot;.&apos;lbs. lbs.Devonshire............    17*6 5*9Wales .....................6*6 1*8North-western countie s.......      9*2 2*3The recommendations made as the result of the enquiryinclude;   (1) More effective control of comitons;   (2) earlyinvestigation of the diseases affecting hill sheep;   (3) eradicationof bracken^ which has extended largely in recent years?   (4) burningof heather and gorse in a rogular rotation;   (5) planting of shelterbelts;   (6) improvement of sheep land by manuring;   (7) fencing;(8) shorter rotations on the enclosed land on sheep farms, with aview to increasing the supply of winter keep.
Effect of Ammonium Nitrate. Plot experiments have been carrle with ammonium nitrate as a fertiliser. In the past, unsatisfa results have been obtained in England, but better in Scotland, Observations made this year it appears that as a fertiliser amnn nitrate is highly effective when used as a top dressing, but ^ crystals that fall on the leaves and remain cause serious scorci and may injure the young plant. It is, therefore, only of valm if it can be applied just before rain so that it is washed off i leaves into the soil.Seed Testing Station. During the first four weeks of the seed testing year, starting on the 1st August, 300 samples have been received at the station, and 90 firms have opened deposit accomLABOUR E1VISI0K. .   &apos;    .   .Agricultural Labour and Military Service, A conference has beei held with the Ministry of National Service and the,. Local Govern Board at which a number of special cases were discussed and agr -meats arrived at, detailed instructions,are in course of preparation. Among other matters, it was decided that the case private gardeners should in future be dealt with by Tribunals, more agricultural vouchers will be issued to.: such men by Count Agricultural Executive Cowdttees.Harvest Labour.&apos;&apos; Reports show that in most parts of the countr labour supplied by the Lepartmont is sufficient for the in-f?athi of the harvest during the present favourable weather.    Applies&apos; for additional men are, however, being; received from several counties in the North of England and in North Wales, and steps beinf. taken to supply the men required from counties where the harvest is well advanced.    7,813 soldiers temporarily released the military authorities are out on hervest.,work, in addition t soldiers continuously employed in agricultural,companies.
9(1gomen&apos;3 Branch,Training and Employmenti     Thatching classes have been openedin Carnarvonshire and Denbighshire.   The demand for women thatchersis increasing, and has,   up to date, been met.Four hundred women have been sent to Kent for threshing work, and a further 600 will be dispatched shortly.     Schemes for the employment of women in threshing have been approved for Essex, Glamorgan and Westmorland.Recruiting.   A recruiting tour has been made during the past week by three women speakers in a car, the following places being visited:-   Herne Bay, Margate and Ransgate, Deal, Folkestone, Hastings, Eastbourne, Bexhill, Brighton and Bognor,     Forty-two open air meetings were held and large numbers of recruits of good type were enrolled.CULTIVATION DIVISION. Tractor Scheme,     A scheme has been devised under which tractors owned by the Department may be loaned to contractors for work on ordinary business lines.     The control of the Executive Committee will be limited to a right to order any particular work to be under-ta!cen and to fix the, maximum prices to be charged, for work on different types of land.     The contractors will be responsible for executing repairs, finding supplies, engaging labour, rendering accounts for work done, and collecting payment from&quot;formers.   The receipts will accrue to the contractors, but, in view of possible loss under this scheme owing to   the present high prices of iuel, labour, spares, etc., the Department are authorising a contribution towards the upkeep of the machinery amounting .to 2s. in the pound on the contractors&apos; receipts.     This amount will be paid by the Committee to the contractors in respect of all work carried out to the Committee&apos;a satisfaction.It is anticipated that the scheme outlined above will reduce substantially the loss per acre which has been incurred, in the past.
The Executive Committees of the counties of Cambridge Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Staffordshire, Sur and the West Riding, of Yorkshire have accepted this scheme and made the necessary arrangements v/ith their contractors.The executive Committees of Leicester and the East Rli of Yorkshire have accepted the scheme, but the arrangements Witl the contractors are not yet completed.The following statement shews the position with regar; the provision of tractors,, machinery and implements for the wee! ended 31st August, 1918:-  -. . .

Henry Ford and Son had been dispatched to farmers.During the week ended 16th August, 6,205 acres were ploughed, 1,431 acres&apos;were cross-ploughed and 2,684 acres were cultivated.Steam Tackle&apos;.   The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows:-   cross-ploughed 4,032 acres, cultivated 34,149 acres, harrowed 714 acres, mole-drained 80 acres, rolled 335 acres. Tot 39,310 acres.Arrangemeats for 1918 Harvest.   14 binders and 17 threshing macti were consigned during the week ended 31st August, making a total 4,206 binders and 310 threshing machines consigned to date.     \ Coal for Agricultural Purposes.   The arrangements for ensuring I supplies of coal for agricultural purposes are now completed,  j
Consumers will, in the first instance, endeavour to obtain coal from their coal merchant or factor.   Failing this, an application will be made to the Agricultural Executive Committee on a prescribed form.   The Committee, if satisfied that the application should be granted, will add a certificate to this effect, and forward the- form to the District Superintendent of the Coal Mines Department for the area in which the supplying colliery Is situated.   The issue of priority orders will be discontinued.   The new system covers all kinds of direct consumption of coal for agricultural purposes and not only steam cultivation and threshing, to which priority orders were restricted.   While, in view of the present grave shortage of coal, some time must necessarily elapse before the new system is in smooth working order, it is believed that it is the best scheme which can be devised to meet the difficulties of the situation.   The Department will remain in close touch with the Coal Mines Department and ijlll deal with any matters for which the local machinery now set up may prove inadequate.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers.   The lists of Approved Agents have now been approved in nearly every case by the Agricultural Executive Committees, and are being prepared for circulation.   The total number of these agents is 966.Lime.   The experimental grinding plant which has been erected at Stoneycombe is now practically complete, and arrangements are -being made for the sale of ground limestone in the south-western counties.Testing of Seeds Order.   Some difficulty has been anticipated in the case of newly harvested cereals in complying with the condition of this Order requiring a declaration of germination, owing to the fact that cereals are frequently sold immediately after threshing on terms which do not give sufficient time for the test to be made.,.
while in addition the gemination test of new seed, unlessspecially dried, is unduly low.     In order to overcome thisdifficulty the Licensing Committee has recommended the issue of&apos;General Licence authorising the postponement of the delivery ofdeclaration for a period of one month.   This will provide sellejwith aa opportunity of testing seed while complying in allessential respects with the Order.A somewhat similar position arises in the case of soinelother seeds, particularly ryegrass, and specific licences onsimilar lines will be issued to firms on application.Seed Potatoes.   The demand for seed of immune first earlies, whilthe Department is.providing from crops grown under contract inScotland, is considerable, and arrangements are being made fordelivery during September and October.   Supplies of &quot;l/ajestic&quot;,,f;;&apos;;err&apos;s Pink&apos;, &quot;Lochar&quot;, &apos;&apos;Dominlon&quot; and other immune varietiesalsn be available for autumn delivery,T,Vrrt diseaset   A number of cases have been reported in which im\varieties of potatoes grov/n under licence on infected land havebeen found to contain a considerable proportion of rogues ofsusceptible varieties, though licences ^ere only Issued aftercareful enquiry.   These facts illustrate the need for more effec!control if a higher degree of purity in stocks is to be securedIt is hopec: that the provisions of the Wart Disease Order of 191and the forthcoming Seed Potato (Prices) Order of the Pood Coiitndeal in? with this cues Lion, together pith the , schepe of Inspect!of growing crops inaugurated this year, will fio much towards obtaining a greater purity in supplies.spraying.   Potato blight has been reported from Northumberland during the peek.     The Disease is now present practically throi^ out the country.   The attacks of the disease are slight in most oarts nf the country, but in parts of Wales, in Cheshire and in1 Kurness cistrict of Lancashire some severe attacks are reported. In the spraying trials at Cambridge very little disease has made its appearance as yet either on unsprayed or on the sprayed plot5
Reports from Wiltshire show that horse drawn spraying machines have given general satisfaction.   The area sprayed by this type of machine in this county is approximately 700 acres.   The results of spraying this season appear to have given general satisfaction, and instances are common of the increased yield resulting from it.I am,. Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.,President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
