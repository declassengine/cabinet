4tb September^1918,   9g(a.LONO-  PANPrE  H-TTNC   IN  MONITORS.rt^5   --------------------&apos;-------Admiralty Femcrandum fcr the T7ar Cabinet.The possibility cf tho enemy using a long range (160 kilometres) gun fcr bombarding London&apos; or any other town in this ocntitry has been fully considered, and the following arc the conclusions arrived at(1)     It is perfectly feasible fcr the enemy to mount such guns in monitors, hut in view of the fact that the objective would be cut cf sight at such a range, a method of indirect firing would have to be resorted to, and, under a&apos;&apos;oh circumstances, a very slight degree of inaccuracy at the gun produces a very large error at the tarret.In order tc obtain the accuracy that Is necessary-, the geographical position cf the gun must he known with exactness, and such exactness cannot be produced in a ship under way at seav    This fact limits the positions from which monitors can operate tc the waters off the Dutch or Belgian Coasts where buoys could be laid.    Guch positions are net within the radius cf London.(2)     The rate cf fire from such a gun would net he more than one round in 15 minutes, and since the position cf the vessel would he quickly ascertained by sound ranging stations,,counter measures could be adopted which would lead tc an attack on the vessel.(3)     Tc bombard London the monitor would have to be at sea,    Dover, Chatham, Harwich and Yarmouth are, however within a radius cf 100 miles from Ostend.(4)     The bursting charge cf the shell cf such a gun is so comparatively small that the material effect would be but slight.(5)     At present the feasibility of mounting such a gun In a submarine is net considered practicable,(6)     It is considered that the result cf such action on the part cf the enemy would not be commensurate with the efforts put forth, and that although he might have considered such an attempt advantageous seme two years ago, he is hardly likely tc embark in such an unprofitable scheme at this stage cf the ,rTar.The above views are put forward fcr the information cf the &apos;&apos;rar Cabinet in accordance&quot;with their request.(Cgd.)
