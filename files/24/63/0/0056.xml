COLONEL ROURE-C Iti^OItt&apos; ON BRITISH i&apos;.AN-POWERNOTES BY T;&apos;IE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF OH REFERENCES TO. THE,ROYACIlRFORCE,It is not my province to deal at length with this intcrest-ing report, but I desire to make a few observations on the criticism of the Royal Air Foroe which is made on the final page, Section B, Where tho following statement appears;-&quot;The foroe of the Air Service numbers 214,000 men. In France v/ith a larger number of machines 100,000 only (soldiers and sailors) are attached to this servi ce&quot;In replying to this statement, I do not desire in any way to criticise the French Air Service, as no one is more sensible than I am of its efficiency but it is neoessary briefly to indicate the main points of difference between the British and French Air Services which appear to have been overlooked by Colonel Roure.In the first place, the operations of the Royal Air Force are necessarily very much more extended than those of the French Air Service. The latter operates in three theatres only, the Western Front, Italy and Scf^nika.   The Royal Air Foroe operates also in Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia, India and and Murmansk,    It is also responsible to a very much greater degree than the French Air Service for the protection of Allied Shipping and the keeping in check of the submarine menace.The personnel employed with naval operational units alone numbers over 18,000 and no organisation on any comparable scale exists in the French Air Service,   Much additional personnel is involved in the very considerable use made by the British squadrons of large flying boats requiring as they do large parties of men for their handling from shore bases and from sea going light cr3.Both services are responsible for Home Defence, but the defence of the British Isles,is obviously a more difficult problem than the defence of France which is to a large extent provided for by the battle front.,The Airship and Kite Balloon Services of the British Army and Navy are also responsible for the absorption of a consider-ablc personnel,  some 25,000 being engaged upon this work,Again, the Rfyal Air Forse through the Independent Force, carries on a continuous campaign of long distance bombing of Germany which it is nlaimed has had most satisfactory and far reaching results.   Luring the month of July alone this force conducted 98 raids into Germany and dropped ?ver 88 tons of explosivesc   Nothing at all comparable to this is attempted by the French Air Service,
163Tho fact that the French are - operating practically the whole Of their Air Force in their own country makes it very much easier frr them t   centralise their erganisati -n and depots.   The ccn-ditigns under which the II yal Air Feroe is required to operate, however, necessitates a c nsiderable increase in the number of auxiliary units, -,f which one unavoidable censequence is the-ptfo-P&quot;:rtienately increased, demand f&apos;.&apos;r personnel.&apos;  Duplicate personnel must often be maintained owing t  &quot;the necessity of more frequent reliefs due t   the distance and. climatic conditions of the &apos;theatres cf war.As &quot;is &quot;well kn - vn the.British Air Service is organised as an entirely separate and self-supporting entity, as distinct fr.m bfth Army&apos; and Navy as these two are from&apos;one an ther.   All its requirements in respect :.-f transport repairs, recruiting, pay, training, medical arrangements, Quarter Master General * &amp; services, meteor-logical services and&apos;-all technical matters are undertaken by the Service &quot;itself, and all future plans of development and expansi &apos;n are being organised en this basis.On the ether hand a very large prr jporti &apos;n :i the labour, c-instruct! rial and auxiliary units required by the French Air Service are underst -.-.-d t. be provided by the French Army and do- net theref re-appear on the strength of-the Air Service which remains a department of the genera? military erganisati-n of the French Forces. -&quot; .It must be remembered that the R--yal Air F.-rce is. designed to be an expanding force and. is -still in cmrse of development * &quot;While new oadres and establishments are in pr-cess  .f f.;rmati.-n &quot;it has at the same time been necessary t   br adon and supplement the original f undati ns which had proved insufficient t-- support the structure, and which the rapid deyel pme-nt ..-  -the Service . during the past 2 years had --utsrrwri.   Under these circumstances it is clearly imp ssible t   sh -w the highest ratio. ,-f efficiency and most effective use .-f man-power.o .Fr m the extract quoted at the beginning of this memorandum it w-..-uld appear that C lon.e-1 R.ure&apos;?s main test of efficiency is the number -f machines maintained.   Comparison&quot;is not easy&apos;as Colonel Ro-ure dwes-nvt state the number - f machines maintained &quot;by the French.   The only figures we have are those furnished by ,them after the 2nd Sessi-h of&quot;the Inter-Allied AviatiUn Committee o n th e 31st M ay i n wh i ch th e y r6 turne d their&quot;tot al numbe r cf active service aeroplanes and seaplanes at 4,&apos;7l2.   It is true . that the British Return of approximately the same date she-wed only&apos; 3,041 machines and this is possibly where-Col mel R-ure has obtained his c mparative figures, but the number returned by the British represented o-nly- the establishment   f- the aquadr ns and n* t the number of serviceable machines on charge * This number at 1st June 1918 amounted, t&apos;&quot; &apos;5,504eor nearly 700 machines more&quot; than th.se returned, by the French *On this basis the c -mparis. n is n.t by any means-unfavourable t) the Royal Air Ftrce.-It is submitted, h--,:rever, that the hnly real test is results obtained and as the figures f,r the V/estern Fr nt fr.m the 18th May to&apos; 28th July 1918 have been furnished by&quot; the French some c mparis n-ean be made.   During this period the French Air Service accounted for 651 enemy machines and the Royal Air Force (ex-cluding&quot; the Independent Fi-rco) f hr 997,   Hence itrniay fairly be
3.Claimed that during the period under review, one of Intense &quot;battle activity on the Western Fr-nt, the Royal Air Force accou for d0% more machines than the French Air Service.   Other than between these dates the French figures are not available, but it is interesting t. note that from the commencement of the Soffline battle on the&quot; 21st Bfarch to the 14th August the Royal Air Force destroyed and drove down out of control no fewer than 2,386 machines *(Sgd.)
