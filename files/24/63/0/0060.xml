There is now no margin in our&apos; reserves in civil life which will enable us to meet tho demands first, from ono source then another, or to repeat tho effort of this spring when in the months of April, May and June 300,962 were posted to the Forces,The following is a short statement of the hypothesis underlying the recommendations put forward at tho end of this paper.     The Allies must and will aim at placing in the field in&quot; Europe millions of Americans if they arc to secure a pure military decision in 1919.     It appears to follow that the Germans may be expected materially to shorten their present line in the West, in order first to secure military reserves to enable thorn to act strongly on the defensive, second to return to industry sufficient men to maintain naval and milit-ary supplies so far as that is now possible for thorn.     They may also be expected to make a supreme effort at sea to inter-fero with the flow of Americans to Europe.    Whatever may prove to be the details, the major part of this naval effort must bo by submarine attack.It is to be anticipated therefore that the closing months of this year and the first half of 1919 will be marked by increased Intensity of submarine effort.     If this anticipatioi bo correct, if follows that this country as the naval pillar . of the Alliance, will be called upon greatly to increase its anti-submarine activities.Much has already been done to meet the difficulties which aro to be expected.    Man power has been provided to produce the contrivances doomed necessary to control the passage of submarines from the North Sea to the Channel, and to reduce to the lowest possible value to tho Germans their possession of the Belgian coast.     Indeed so low ob-viously is the strategic value of that coast to them now that it is not unreasonable to speculate that they will not much longer consider its rotontion worth tho military effort absorbed in holding it.Further man power has been absorbed in equipping the fleet with largo numbers of anti-submarine craft, and appli-anees which, in conjunction with the American contribution, may be regarded as reasonably adequate to moot, so far as
174such craft and appliances can, the.-coraii^,,inten.sd.ficat:Lcn of. the submarine war.,   . *   -As yet adequate provision does not appear to have been made for anti-submarine aircraft, nor is the output of merchant tonnage satisfactory.It appears therefore that in the interests of the Alliance as a whole It is necessary for this country to con-centrate its energies, in the first placo on making, provision to complete its preparations against tho probable intensified submarine attacks.     This will necessarily include the pro-vision of the requisite enrolled and enlisted personnel, as well as the maintenance of the basal industries.The second call upon the energies of the country appears to bo to maintain Its capacity for producing supplies for its own Forces and for those of tho allies,    Clothing materials, boots, equipment.-arid the more intricate land-munitions, especially tanks and&apos;guns, appear to deserve to rank highest In this second category of war needs..    Close after these in order of priority come such activities as food and timber production.In the third class appear to fall such needs as the supply of recruits for the Army and that portion of tho Air Force which serves with it.In setting out calls upon our man power in order of urgency there is no Intention to suggest an absolute priority of those in the first class over those in the second or even in the third.     All are obviously urgent.     The object is to determine tho emphasis to placo upon the different parts of f our war effort.     It is upon considerations of this nature      that the recommendations which I make arc based. *Before proceeding to them however there are two matters which do not directly fall within my sphere of responsibility but which vitally affect the distribution of our man-power upon which I desire to express an opinion.i&apos;e have now a supreme direction of the military forces i In Franco and Belgium.     It appears to me that there is some tendency on the part of that direction to attempt to arrogato to itself the function of the supreme control of the war. That I regard as most dangerous.    Fundamentally this is a naval struggle;   and I know of no evidence which would entitle anyone to assume that France has a profoundor grasp of the problems of naval warfare than there is to be found in this country,-   Colonel Rourefs report upon our man power position, appeared to me to be most mischievous, and I venture to express the hope that no similar episode will bo permitted to occur,. a The second matter is of a different kind but. perhaps not less important...    One or two examples will best indicate Its nature.Tho total number of coppersmiths and coppersmiths mates -employed in tho whole of the munitions and shipbuilding Industries, including men ovor tho military age, is estimated
- 5 -I 1 vito be Of these--only a f reaction are employedon aeroplane construction.    The Royal Air Porce-domand for J^oa^.--eopporsmiths and coppersmiths&apos; mates during the remainder of 3.      this year and the first five months Of next amounts approx-g      imately to 5,580.    Even assuming that part of this demand might, and indeed should, be converted Into a demand for sheet metal workers, though this suggestion is not put forw ward by the Air Ministry;   this means that the Air ministry is arranging for maintenance in such a way as would absorb far more than the total number of coppersmiths employed on tho output of aero engines.     Such a proposition must immediately defeat its own ends.     To take another example, a demand is submitted for the samo period for 16,000 wood workers.     This typo of labour is perhaps the least difficult to release, but this demand if granted would absorb upwards of 40$ of the whole of the skilled wood workers engaged on munitions work, other than shipbuilding and constructional work.I have selected two examples, tho most extreme, but -  they arc not isolated.     I can find no evidence that any of the sorvicos have oven yet realised that the skilled men of the country are to-day among its most precious assets, nor am I convinced that everything that could be done to economise In the number of skilled men allowed on establishment has ycc boon done In any of the Forces,     It is not difficult both to understand and to some extent to sympathise with the desire of unit commanders to have thoir units as complete In them-selves as possible, but there is no doubt that skilled men in the Forces spend many hours standing by or doing work which unskilled men could equally well perform.     Until tho Intens-ity of employment in the Forces of all skilled men on skilled work approaches that of similar men    - on munitions work In civil life there must bo subtraction from, our theoretically possible effort on the mechanical side of warfare.     I am not ignorant of the difficulties,     I recognise them;   but the existence of these admitted difficulties Is I fear too often an exeuso for doing notliing.     The whole position is however reduced to absurdity when a service seriously demands for maintenance a number of men which, if supplied, would hopeless-ly cripple the output of tho very machines which they are destined to maintain.It is hardly within my province, nor have I sufficient material to recommend the steps which should be taken by the Air Force to economise its use of skilled labour.    But I would urge that not only its establishments, but also tho whole system on which those establishments are based, should be thoroughly reviewed in order to secure the most efficient use of skilled labour to moot the oxpansion of tho Force.   I need hardly say that any assistance which I or my Department can give will be most gladly offered.fthile dealing in this general way with the Air Force demand I desire to placo on record my belief that It is most urgent in view of the considerations expressed above that the provision of squadrons capable of employment on anti-submarine duties should not be drastically limited in tho manner appar-ently contemplated, com- that men power should almost at any cost be made available to meet tho requirements of the Admiralty reduced estimate,
178P A RT   II.I have estimated that 300,000 men can be receuited In 1919 without seriously weakening the industrial side of our&apos; war effort,   This estimate is based upon the assumption that ppendix 6. 700,000 men will be recruited in 1918.   Of these 546,781 had art 1.)     been recruited up to 31st August.   The immediate problemtherefore is to consider first the least disturbing steps to be taken to secure the recruitment of the estimated numbers, second, the best possible distribution between the three Forces of the men recruited.As regards recruiting; the most difficult question is undoubtedly to determine the numbers to be recruited from establishments and firms under the control of the Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions, practically the only source from which any appreciable number of skilled and semi-skilled men can be recruited.   I suggest that the releases by the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions should be on the following lines(a) Both Departments should release the balance ofGrade 1 men born in the years 1895 to 1897, who will be available after the Departments have adjudicated upon the special claims submitted for men born in(b)those years. It is estimated that this yield more than 7,000 men.will notThe Admiralty should release this year the Grade I men born In the year 1900 who have not yet been recruited, with the exception of men engaged in occupations for which an a ore limit of 19 is fixed in the Schedule of Protected Occupations, such occupations comprising the most important types of, labour employed on hull construction and repair;-and excepting also men engaged on the manufacture of scientific Instruments, for which there is an urgent demand from a limited number of firms.SimilarlytheMinistryof Munitions should release- the unrecruited Grade I men born in the 1900, with the exception of men engaged in the following Industries:-year1, Iron k Steel,2, Mines and Quarries,3, Tanks.4. Guns,5, Scientific Instruments.6. Occupations marked (S) in the Schedule of Protected Occupations, i.e. occupations which have been found to be sufficiently vital to be graded for release, subject to substitution.This it is estimated would involve the retention of 5,300 Grade I men in the 1900 Class,.ppendix 4.It is estimated that the combined releases by the Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions on the ai-or principles would yield from the 1900 Class apprcx-imately 15,700 recruits.*X- It is estimated that there are in these occupations some4,000 Grade I men born in the year 1900 and a similar ,   number born In 1901.
1! i177Ippendix 4,- 5 -(c) The Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions should next year release, as they attain the age of 18, the Grade I youths horn in the year 1901, subject to the same reservations&quot;as are suggested In Paragraph (b).   It is estimated that the reservation In the case of the Ministry of Munitions would involve the retention of some 16,200 Grade I youths,  ;and thatthe combined releases by the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions would supply approximately 33,800 recruits.(d) The Admiralty and. the Ministry of Munitions should release such further numbers of men of other ages as they find possible, having regard to their pro-grammes of production and the reinforcement and dilu-tion of their industries.lendix 5*The balance of men required to complete the recruitment of 700,000 recruits for this year and 300,000 recruits next year,will be obtained In the ordinary course of recruiting, and the arrangements to give effect to this call for no special remark, except that it must be clearly understood that it will be impossible to raise more than a very small number of Grade t men between the ages of 18*8 months and 43 years, and that the greater part of the necrults will be youths of the 1901 class.   It is, however, perhaps relevant to note that the concen-tration of all constructional work under a single control - a subject which has been already brought to the notice of the War Cabinet - would greatly facilitate the solution of the man-power problem, so far as that Industry is concerned, both In relation to recruiting and to the supply of labour.jendiX&apos;&quot;6, it II.)As regards the distribution of recruits among the Forces, I suggest that if the premises on which this Memorandum is based are approved, priority should be given to the naval requirements, and to such part of the Air Force requirements as are attributable to the maintenance and development of the naval effort of this country.   The naval demand would absorb approx-imately the following number of recruitsSeptember to December 1918    23,266 January to May 1919    28,655   :June to December 1919     31,523The Admiralty have not fonnulated any demand for the second half of 1919, but the above figures are based on the hypothesis that their requirements for the second half of 1919 would be 25* less than for the first half of 1919 -filth the exception of 4,314 for the Royal Marine Engineers * 5,502 for wastage during 1918, and 7,571 for wastage during the first half of 1919, the whole of the naval demand is based on the manning of new craft according to the authorisedprogramme ofil development.
-   0   -17I have not been able to fix any figure for the Air-Force demand in relation to the naval effort;   but the total personnel which I suggest should be allocated to the Air Force is given in the next paragraph.I suggest that&apos;-the Ministry of National Service should be instructed to meet the gross demands of the Air Force up to 75$, excluding aviation candidates. This would mean:-September to December 1918 36,000 recruits, &apos; January to May 1919 43,000      &quot;I have suggested 75% because I understand that apart altogether from the question whether the gross demands of the Air Force is excessive, there is very little chance of more than 75% of the production programme on which that demand is based being realised.I suggest that the balance of recruits should be allocated to the Army.   This ,YOuld give the Army approx-imately the following numbers of recruitst-September to December 1918 95,734 . January to May 1919   53,345-X* June to December 1919 143,477As regards aviation candidates, the Air Force are asking for 3,500 a montho   Presumably this number would be proportionately reduced by any reduction of the aircraft programme.   Negotiations are at present taking place between the War Office and the Air Ministry as to the number of aviation candidates which can be released from the Army,   I suggest, therefore, that the War Office., the Air Ministry and the Ministry of National Service should agree as to the number of aviation, candidates whom it Is necessary to provide each month, including the number that can be found from the Army, and that the Ministry of National Service should use its best endeavour to recruit the balance.As already stated, the number of skilled or semi-skilled whom it would be possible to obtain is wholly insufficient to meet the demands of the Navy and the Air Force for recruits with technical experience. I propose therefore to allocate such recruits in the first place to meet the requirements of the Navy, and that portion of the Air Force which is associated with the naval effort;   and in the second place to meet as far as may be possible the balance of the Air Force requirements.It Is estimated that Admiralty and Munitions releases between now and the end of 1919 should approximated,o 56,000 men, not counting any men over 23 years of age who may be released by the Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions in the ordinary course of administration. This does not mean that there would be 56,000 men and youthsThe Air Ministry has not formulated any demands for the latter part of next, year and I have not -budgeted for any further demand by the R.A.F., as the wastage In their personnel, other than pilots and observers, is very small.Gee first footnote.   If it is decided to make any allocation to the R.A.F. for these months this figure^must be corres-pondingly reduced.
&quot;7- 173of exactly equivalent occupations to those specified in the Admiralty and Mr Force demands,   On the contrary, talcing the relative proportion of the occupations of the types required by the Navy and the Air Force to the total number of types, the number of directly suita-ble skilled and semi-skilled men and youths will only amount to the following1895 to 1897 classes 2,000 1900 class 4,0001901   &quot; , 8,000Total 14,000In addition to these, in the ordinary comb out, Ehe Ministry of Munitions will probably bo able to release an additional number of wood workers and sheet metal workers.The Navy and the Air Force will no doubt, however, need men who are possessed of technical training&apos; and Who, though they do not correspond to the types laid down in their requirements/ can be more readily trained than men without Such qualificationd to do the work which is needed.In these circumstances it will hot be possible to allocate ant technical recruits for the Army.   This will mean that the Army must maintain its technical unita by drawing on skilled men serving in non-technical units, and by&quot;using any technical units which become surplus to requirement3 by the reduction of the number of divisions, as draft finding units.The further question whether the Army may be able -to supply the Air Force with skilled men depends on the extent to which the reduction of the number of divisions Is to be carried.   But unless the number of divisions Is reduced below the number at present contemplated by the War Office, the War Office does not expect to be able to afford any material assistance in this direction.
