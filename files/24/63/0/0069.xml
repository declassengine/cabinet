THE Minister in. charge of the Bill will be authorised to state at the appropriate stage that the Report of the Local Government Committee presided over by Sir Donald Maclean on the transfer of functions of Poor Law Authorities in England and Wales has been carefully considered by the Government, and that the Government accept the recommendations of the Committee that services relating to the care and treatment of the sick and infirm should not be administered as a part of the Poor Law, but should be made a part of the general health services of the community. It will also be stated that the Government regard it as a matter of urgency that effect should be given to these recommendations as soon as possible.2. It will further be stated that the Government accept the principle that the remaining functions of Poor Law Authorities should also be transferred to other bodies, but are not in a position to formulate precise proposals at the present time.3. Any approach to a complete application of the scheme recommended by the Committee will involve considerable labour, and must be preceded by further enquiries into certain questions, some of which must be of a detailed character. It will, however, be stated that the Government recognise their responsibility for making proposals on these subjects as soon as the exigencies of the Parliamentary situation permit of their being dealt with.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 1, September 11, 1918.o1[785]
