On 18 days end 16 nights no raids were carried out owing to adverse weather conditions.43, Increase of During the month, the strength of the Eorce hasStrength,   been increased by the arrival of- throe Night Flying and one Day Flying Squadrons.No.97 Randley-Pagc Squadron arrived on the 9th of August from England,   On the 19th, No, 215 Squadron - - arrived from the Expeditionary Force,   On the 31st No,- 115&apos;Squadron (Hancllcy-Pages) and Ho,&quot;110 Squadron (D,H.9a ) .   arrived from England,No.97 Squadron commenced operations on the 19th and No, 215 Squad.-on on the 22nd,   Both these \ .   &apos; Squadrons have already carried out good raids,- ..        . No. 100 Squadron is in process of having itsF.E31g replaced by Handlcy-Pages,   They now have five Handley-iPages and six F,E.!s.   I hope to complete the exchange by September 6th. In the meantime, this , . Squadron is operating with Handley-Pages and F.E. s.4, Distant Raids,During the month the following long distance raids into Germany have been carried outi-By day: DUREN, FRANKFURT, DARUSTADT, C0BL::-NZ, KARLSRUHE, -   . and MANNHEIM.1
-2-By night: COLOGNE and FRANKFURT: phe, latter twice.Repeated attempts to reach these two places have been foiled by cloud and wind,I append brief details of each of the above mentioned raids ,(a) PURBN.On the 1st of August 12 machines of No, 55 Squadron left to attack COLOGNE,   On arrival over the target COLOGNE was covered with thick cloud, and the leador of the formation turned and proceed-ed to DUREN, where bombs were dropped on the Factories and Railway from 15,000 feet,   A large fire was started.   All machines returned safely. See photograph &quot;A&quot;,(b) FRANKFURT.FRANKFURT, for the first time, was attacked on August 13th, twelve machines of Noe 55 Squadron dropping two 250 lb,, eighteen 112 lb, and several smaller bombs from 14,000 feeta   The majority of the bombs burst in the town, East of the Goods Station, and all the machines returned safely, with , the loss of one observer killed by machine gun fire &apos; The formation was heavily attacked by 40 Scouts of various types over MANNHEIM on its way to the ob-jective, and throughout its return journey.   As a result of the fighting two hostile machines were destroyed and three were driven down.On the night of the-2l/22nd of August two machines of No.216 Squadron reached FRANKFURT, and dropped one 550 lb, and eighteen 112, bombs on the Railway Station.Again on the night of the 25/26th a machine of No,216 Squadron succeeded in bombing FRANKFURT, The majority of the bombs foil in the neighbourhood of the Railway Station, , See photographs   Dtt and &apos;&quot;B.1&quot;,(c) DARkSTADT.On the 16th of August ten machines of No, 55 Squadron attacked the Railways,at DARMSTADT, Tho Squadron was attacked by 20 hostile machines over the target and lost three machines. Three of the enemy&apos;s machines wore driven down out of control. See photograph &quot;Ct!*(d) COBLENZ.On the 22nd of August eight machines of No, 55 Squadron attacked the Railways and Factories at COBLENZ from 13,000 feet,(c) KARLSRUHE.On the 11th,of August No, 104 Squadron sent eleven machines to the Station at KARLSRUHE,   The formation was led by the Squadron Commander, and1
2A Q &apos;J 0dropped their bombs from 0,000 feet, causing a heavy explosion in the Station and1scoring many direct hits on the Railway Sidings.     In the course of fighting one of our machines wasrbrought down. Throe/ of the enemy were driven down out of control.(fj.COLOGNE.On the night of the 2l/22nd August two machines -of No.216 Squadron dropped just over a ton of bombs on Cologne Station/causing a very large explosion.,Chemical - Sift raids have been carried out- on chemicalWorks.      works,   The Badische Aniline und Soda Farrik at MANNHEIM- have been attacked twice by night and once by day.On the 22nd August; ten machines of No.104 Squadron reached this objective and dropped bombs from 11,500 feet.   On their way to MANNHEIM the formation was very heavily attacked and ].ost two machines.   Severe fighting continued over tho objective, but useful re-lults were observed.   Seven bombs burst on the Factory and four fires broke out.   One direct hit was scored on a large new building Immediately South of the Factory., &quot;and a fire was also caused in a Factory on the   last side of ,    - the River.   The hostile machines pressed their attack- throughout the return journey and five more of our machines fell.   The enemy lost three machines during the--fighting, and others were driven down out of control.On the night of the 25/26th August. No.215 ... ,\ ;Squadron made -their first attack on the Badische-Aniline und&apos;  oda-Fabrik with two machines.   The result of this; -,v:i&apos;,\.&apos;&apos;  raid is of particular interest, and I therefore include a more detailed account.&quot; The two machines left at 8 ofclock.   The first approached : the target from the North west, following the River, and gliding&quot;from 5,000 feet,   An   intense A.A. &quot;barrage was put up, ,,but the bursts were all above the &quot; machine.- The 1 pilot of this machine flew over the tar-get at 200 feet and dropped sixteen 112 lb. and ten 25 lb. bombs on the objective.   All bursts were observed and the pilot claims:direct hits with every bomb.   Two   -large fires and one small one were started, and a heavy explosion, which violently rocked.the machine, was caused. The lights of the Works were, extinguished, but the target was well lit up by the Searchlightsthe beams of which were directed almost horizontally in their efforts to locate the machine,.   After releasing his bombs, the pilot circled ;round for seven minutes, sweeping the various Works and Searchlights with machine gun fire.   The second pilot also approached the target from the North West, after making two abortive attempts to reach his objective from the South-West and West.   He flew over the target at 500 feet and dropped sixteen 112 lb. bombs and fourteen 25 lfc.
*4-bombs, all with good effect.   Again all bursts were&apos; observed and all hit the target. , A second large $c** plosion was caused, and&apos;Ihuge columns of smoke rose. This pilot likewise circled round the target and swept the streets with machine gun fire.   On the roturn journey both of these machines passed through :;rain and &apos;      thick clouds, whilst lightning and thunder were pre., valent throughout the trip.On the night of the 22/23rd August one Handle&apos; Page of No* 100 Squadron attacked the Gas Factory at , &apos;  SAARALBEN.   Bombs were dropped from 1500 feet, causing an explosion and a fire, which was seen to,be blazing &apos; I-! hours..later,   Comparison of photograph &apos;JDI; with photograph &quot;D,l&quot; shows considerable damage in the $out West corner of the Factory.6, Explosives On the 8th of August ten machines of No, 55Factories.;     Squadron attacked tho Factory at WALLINGEN; North East . . of ROMBAS,   Bursts were observed on the Factory.The only other attack on a target of this * nature was the one on DUREN described in paragraph 4 ( above. - &apos;7. Blast On August the 20th one machine of No. 99Furnaces.        Squadron, flying in low clouds, attacked the Blast Furnacos at LILLINGEN from 2,000 feet, and obtained a direct hit on the Works.Attacks by night have been made against the Blast Furnaces at VOELKLINGEN, BURBACH (three times), FORBACH and FREIMENGE.   Considerable damage has been -done at FORBACH and BURBACH,Many successful attacks have been made against Railway objectives0   At EHRAtfGE Junction, on the night of the 23/24th of August,&apos;a machine of No, I Squadron bombed the Station from 1,500 feet.   This target wa.s bombed in order to co-operate with the Fret Squadrons in their attacks on the Railway Outlets to the BRIEY Iron Basin.At Metz Station, on the night of the 19/SOtl ,August and following night, No. 97 Squadron dropped fi tons of bombs with good effect.During the month 64 attacks have been made against aerodromes and a total weight of 61 ton3 of b has been dropped.   Much damage has been caused,to the enemas installations.

290There are now In this Area two Bombardment &apos; Groups of the French Aviation.   Arrangement3 were con-cluded with the General Officer Commanding the Group of Armies of the East for a combined attack to be made by the British and French Aviation Services against hostile aerbdSomos1 on this front,   On the first night, the French Groups attacked MARS-LA-TOUR, and the Inde-pendent Force attacked FOLSPERWILLER,   The results Of the damage caused by these raids are shown in photo-graphs &quot;Eol and &quot;F,l&quot;*   Unfortunately, after the first night, the weather broke, and since that daue no further combined   attacks have been possible.10. Roconnaiss-ances.The night reconnaissances carried out by No.100 Squadron were discontinued on the 21st of August, the General Officer Commanding the Group of Armies&quot;of the East agreeing to carry them out from that date, This was necessary on account of the change of type of machines in No, 100 Squadron,Photographic reconnaissances have been carried out by No. 55 Squadron whenever opportunities occurred.11, Baby Incen- On the 17th of August No, 216 Squadron droppeddiary boxes of Baby Incendiary Bombs and five tins of petrolBombs        on the Black Forest, from 3,000 to 4,000 feet.   Pilots report that seven very large fires broke out, one of them covering an area about half a mile square.   Six of these fires were just West of GENGENBACH.   Owing to bad weather there was no opportunity on the following days of ascertaining whether the fires had spread, but on the 21st August an American pilot, flying over the lines on the EPINAL front, reported seeing clouds of smoke rising from the Black Forest South-East of OFFEN-BURG.On the night of the 25/26th of August No, 97 Squadron dropped 23 cases of B9I. Bombs on the aerodrome at BOULAY.   The shooting was not particularly good, but one fire broke out in the vicinity of the aerodrome.It is my intention to further test these bombs against aerodromes, factories, and, after s spell of dry weather, again against the Black Forest, in order that their value may be definitely determined.12. Hostile Bombing,Up to date the attacks made by the enemy against our aerodromes have been insignificant.   His activities in this direction have increased, but have been directed principally against NANCY, LUNEVILLE, EPINAL, BACCARAT, and other thickly populated areas.   The aero-drome at XAFFERVILLERS has been attacked five times, the only damage caused, so far, being a small fire in one of the workshops.
&quot;6&quot;AZELOT Aarodrome has boon attacked four time) On the night of the 30/31st August bombs were dropped by six twin-engine machines,   Some damage was done to four huts, and casualties amounted to four killed and five wounded.It is certain that desperate efforts will ^ made by the enemy to defeat our object by the destruc-tion of our aerodromes, and a hard-fought bombing battl must be anticipated.13, Increase in)) Identifications of hostile units during theHostlie&quot; Tmonth have established an increase of four Pursuit and I IvTation Home Defence Squadrons opposed to us.   This means an UnT &quot;s.&quot;&quot; &apos; addition of 72 Scout machines.   Our formations invari.ably meet with heavy opposition, and have on several occasions been attacked by 20, 30, and as many as 40 hostile machines.On the 12th of August No, 104 Squadron on their way to attack HAGENAU Aerodrome were attacked by 23 machines.   As the result of the fighting four of th! enemy were destroyed and three others were driven dovra out of control.   In this fight we lost two machines. On the same day No. 55 Squadron in their raid &quot;Oh PRA] FTJRT were attacked by about 40 Scouts.   We lost no machines, and destroyed two of the enemy.On the 22nd of August, on their way to MANki No, 104 Squadron were attacked by, approximately, ./40 hostile machines.   Before reaching the objective two o] our machines were brought down.   Fighting continued over the target, but, in spite of this, bombs were dropped with a fair amount o  accuracy!   The enemy (kept up the\ fight on the return journey to w..tb.i:i a few miles of our lines, and five more of our machines werel destroyed.   The enemy1 s tactics on this occasion appealconcentrate their attacks on the rea: of tho enemy&apos; s machines wore undoubted! some were probably destroyed, bub the close that neither pilots nor observer!to haye been to machines. Many ly damaged, and fighting was sohad time to observe results.Again on the 30th, twelve machines of No, 551 Squadron, in an attack on THIQNVILLE, encountered 35 hostile machines, and&apos;on this occasion lost four,   Thr;l of   the enemy were shot down out of controlsOn the night of the 15/l6th of August, a pilj and observer In an F,Es of No, 100 Squadron shot down twin-engine machine over the enemy1s aerodrome at BOULAY,   The enemy turned on a searchlight, and the crashed machine was seen on tho ground.enemy1s month.As the result of fighting in the air over w country, we havo lost 21 machines during the
2114. No.55Squadron.-7-The raids&apos;to DUREN, FRANKFURT and DARMSTADT took respectively 5,1 hours, 5.5 hours, and 5 hours.Duration of  As you are fully aware this machine carried only 5jRaids.5. No,104Squadron6. American. Personnel.17. Statistics,hours of petrol.   This narrow margin of safety is the cause of additional strain on the pilots.   Every effort should &quot;bo made to increase the fuel in future types.^he D.H.9 B.H.P. can no longer bo considered as a service type of bombing machine. Their coiling is not sufficiently high., and the losses which they would suffer if their uso was continued would be unjustifiable. To increase the size of the formations would not over-come the difficulties; it would merely increase the losses.It should be noted that American pilots and observers, attached to the Independent Force, have taken part in many of the operations carried out during the month.   Thoy have rendered much valuable service.A Table showing the hours flown, bombs dropp-ed, etc, during the month is attached for your information.(SIG-NED) H, TRENCHARD.Major General, Commanding Independent Force, Royal&apos;Air Force.1st September, 1918,
