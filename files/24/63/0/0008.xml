mnt lent l/h fr- *; &quot;OReferred toCommittee of Home Affairs(THIS -DOCUMENT IS THE P30PS3TY OF HIS BRITAwIC MAJESTY1 9 GOVTOMNT) .SEC R E T . G.T&quot;. 5600.I rWAR CABINET.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE RESERVE DEPOT AT HLAKPFORD. Memorandum &quot;by Sir Alfred Mond. (Circulated&apos;with reference to G.T. 5544).To the War Cabinet,Whilst full;/ recognising the seriousness of the situation in connection with this particular wcrk, I feel hound to enter the strongest possible protest against the proposed attempt to meet it by the payment rf Winchester rates of wages.(2) Though the Air Ministry only admit that such a course would be liable to lead to demands fcr increases at ether Government works in the area, the fact is that it would inevitably do so, and with the certain result that while the extension of the rates was under discussion most, if not all, of the men would transfer their labour.   The memorandum leaven entirely out of account the all-important faot that nc amount of increase in wages or improvement in conditions of labour will create a furth-er supply of labour.(3) it is suggested that there is only one alternative, namely, the e ployment of prisoners rf war.   Without entering into the question rf the wisdom of such a course, I wish to make it perfectly clear that, in my opinion, there are no alternatives, but only one course cpen to the Government in dealing with the pressing matter cf the dearth of building labour in its relation to the construc-tional needs of the moment, and that is&quot;to place all building work and maintenance in the charge of one Department, that Depart-ment executing the work in strict conformity as to priority with the decisions of a strengthened works Construction Sub-Committee cf the Cabinet.(4) &apos;The advantages in respect to labour of this course are manifest.   All labour would be pooled and its capabilities for dealing with the programme of construction could be accurately estimated.   Workmen could be informed in good time of the probable length of their employment on any one job, and advisee as to the nearest district where they could secure further work and cf the   . rates and conditions which would be attached tc that Jcb*   In the event of a dispute the men, through their Unions, would deal with one Department only, instead of with half a do sen - one of which has itself had no less then eleven separate divisions responsible fcr carrying cut building operations.   The &quot;Building Labour Com-mittee could concentrate en deciding on what were the rates payable and in settling any differences that might arise between the Department and the men, instead-of spending much valuable time in the endeavour to adjust differences between Departments.(5) There are many other advantages,, proved in practicein other directions, all tending to a considerable reduction in the cost of the work and to expedition in the execution, but, as these have no bearing on the immediate question cf labour I content myself with indicating them
H     2(a) Avoidance of multiplication of technical staffs,(b) Reduction, &quot;by ooneentration, in administrative and clerical staffs.(o) Standardization of requirements would be facility(d) A consistent application of cheaper methods of construction.(e) Continuity&apos;and uniformity of policy ensured in Government&apos;s dealings with the building trades.(f) &quot;Government Gould obtain better terms from ocm-tractors, including the diminution of prime cost contracts which have been so oostly to the State.(6) The disadvantages of having several Departments engaged Upon building work have been exemplified to a marked degree during the war, but in nothing so much as in the competition for labour,(7) successive Governments have adopted the policy of entrus ing more and more to the Office of Works - which,was instituted for the purpose - the responsibility&apos; for the provision and maintenance cf the buildings of the State&apos;erected by civilian labour.   The Ministry of Labour, the Cawley Committee, the Retrenchment Committee a&apos;nd other bodies have at different times urged very strongly the concentration of all building work in the Office of Works.   In.point of fact a proposal to hold an u quiry into the various building Departments has been made to w by a Committee which is enquiring into my Department and the matter is at this moment under the consideration of the Treasii It would be of immense advantage if .this enquiry aould be expedited.In the meantime I would like to point out that if the Air Ministry proposal is allowed to take effect.it will draw all labour from the Flax Factories which my Department is erecting in the area, and the completion of which is so urgent that there is a grave risk of the flax crop being lost if the buildings are not completed forthwith.   I would also point out that as no aeroplane can be made without flax it is clear that Flax Factories should take priority.(8) I can only suggest as the proper course for the moment that the question of the priority should be left to the deter-i       mination of the Works Construction Sub-Committee. ,I may add that I understand that the Chairman of the Building Executive Committee, shares my conviction as to the solution offered by.the one building Department idea.H.M. Office of Works.5rd September, 1916.
