SECRET.if; ?r-:i September, 1918,LSRCHANT   SHIPBUILDING   POSIT IONMemorandum for the War Cabinet by the Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding,I have examine.] the forecasts made in the Simmer of last year, of the possible output of merchant ships under certain circumstances and under improved conditions as to additional labour,    I am of opinion that these estimates were justified, but circumstances have prevented the diversion to Merchant Shipbuilding of the additional labour relied upon when the estimates were based, nor has it been possible to free the Cargo Shipbuilding Yards from Naval construction, and this work (together with the increased repairs) has to a large extent neutralized any additional men brought into the industry.Unfortunately, notwithstanding the nonfulfilment of the conditions, these forecasts have given rise to exaggerated expectations which cannot be realized for some time, and which will render my position a difficult one.By utilizing all the available resources in the Engineering and allied trades, which include firms ordinarily engaged on land work, I am of opinion that a sufficient supply of propelling machinery, auxiliaries, and fittings generally can be procured without drawing a large number of men from their present situations,Essential materials are also forthcoming in sufficient quantity, 1The question of increased output of Merchant tonnage
1resolves itself, therefore, ir-to one of man power for the aetual work of hull construction.In considering the possibilities of obtaining: additional workers, it must be borne in mind that She essential shipbuilding operations, which are the only ones at present seriously short of men, mush be carried out by men of good physique and accustomed to heavy work - largely on scaffolding. The employment of unlimited numbers of women, or men of low category, :1s therefore unlikely to produce appreciable results.The question of dilution of essential trades, by less essential tradesmen, is being carried out, although there are many difficulties still to be overcome, in the way of further provision, and better uses of labour saving tools.The number of men engaged today on new merchant ship construction is sufficient to produce only 1,650,000 gross tons of merchant ships per annum.I have been considering the question of the number -of additional men it would be necessary to devote to Merchant Shipbuilding to yield the desired output of 3,000,000 tons per annum, and I am of opinion that an additional 76,000 men (of whom one-half, if possible, should be skilled) are &quot; required, and increases beyond the present figuses are only possible pro rata to the extent to which these 76,000 additional workers are forthcoming.These figures apply to Shipyard workers only, for the reasons already stated.There are only three sources from which suitable men can be drawn, viz1, Transfers from Repair Work.2, Transfers fro;; Naval Construction,3, Withdrawals from the Army,1.     With regard to Repairs&quot;,    A reduced volume of work woAld
release men for new construction, and I am very hopeful that a considerable number of men will be so released, There was a continuous increase In the tonnage of merchant ship repairs completed from August 1917 to August 1918, -and although there was a falling off in June and July, it is perhaps a little early to definitely count on this decrease being continuous;   still, I am hopeful that it will be sufficient to release men for new merchant construction,2,     With regard to Naval Construction,      I am bound to admit that the policy of constructing protective craft has been attended so far by most successful results, by reducing the losses.      But the increase to these craft is already very great, and looking at the matter from the merchant ship construction side, it is apparent that the need for Naval Construction has seriously restricted the building of Merchant Ships, and that the present programme will allow of little relief during 1919sA division -has been made of the shipbuilding yards for Naval and Merchant Construction, but although 66,1 of the Merchant-Yards have been cleared of naval work, yet in the balance, which includes a numeer of large yards, there * are no less than 115 Naval and Auxiliary Vessels under*construchion, equivalent to 412,972 gross tons of Merchant Ships, and 20,000 men who should be on Merchant Work are working on these vessels.Under an$ circumstances it will be necessary to complete the construction of these Naval Vessels, in order to make room for the Merchant work, and at present the Naval Construction is being given equal priority with Merchant work,
There are also 29 Naval Vessels, equivalent to 88,254 gross tons of Merchant Ships, ordered but not laid down in the Merchant Yards.Inversely there are 25 Merchant Vessels (92*489 gross tons) under construction in Naval Yards, but these vessels are not being given equal priority with naval work, and are regarded simply as &quot;stand by&quot; jobs.There are m Merchant Vessels under orders to bo laid down in the Naval Yards.&apos; o.    With regard to the withdrawal of further skilled men from the Army.       I have been unable to obtain any figures as to the number of Shipyard workers still with the Forces, but there is undoubtedly a large number.I believe I am. right in saying that so far very few(if any) men have been withdrawn from the actual.fighting line, or from the technical units, and I can quite understand that the military situation has hitherto rendered this undesirable, but I submit the time has now arrived when everyshipyard worker - without any exception - should be returned to shipbuilding.To sum up the position, -  Considering the very small increase in labour on new Merchant Ship Construction during the last six months, I consider the recent improvement in output is most satisfactory, and I am of opinion that it is largely duo to improved organisation of control during the whole of the last twelve mouths.    During the last six months the increase in output is 14.3$ with an increase in labour of 3.3$.1 i
To improve the output of Merchant Ships I thereforemake the following recommendation^, which appear to me tohe matters for which tho Cabinet alone can take the&quot;responsibility:^ .So far as Naval Construction is concerned, I am glad to learn that the Board of Admiralty have recently recommended to the War Cabinet a material reduction in the 1919 Naval programme, which willenable a most valuable transfer of 22,000 men, progressively to the second quarter of 1919.    This will be of inestimable value to me-, but it is I understand contingent upon an agreement being reached TKifch America on Naval co-operation, and I cannot too strongly urge that this agreement should be effected a,t the earliest possible date, if the improvement desired in Merchant shipbuilding is to be attained.Arrangements should be made for the immediate release,&quot; for Merchant Shipbuilding, of all Shipyard Workers - without exception or qualification - at present with the Haw,&quot; Army, Royal Air Force, or other Government employment,and that these workers be returned tothe districts in which their homes are situated, as far as possible,(Sgd)    PIRRI2.Control!er-General of Merchant Shipbuilding.Forwarded,(sgd) Erie Geddes.On9a18.
