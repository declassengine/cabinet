E 0 R E T.Ml&quot; HALL ^y&apos;ariew of 1* nent eventsppcupation of &quot;eraan CoastsAPPRECIATION OF SITUATION II: NORTH RUSSIA. .9th September, 1918*The reasons which originally led to the despatch Of Allied troops to North Russia were i-(1)   To maintain communication with the patrioticand Anti-German elements in Russia. (2)   To deny Western Siberia and its supplies to the enemy,  -(3)   To support the Czechs who were then on their way to the Northern Ports with a view to their transfer to France, (4)   To protect the Allied stores at Archangel, In order to protect our communications with Archangel It was necessary to hold the Murman Coast and, during the summer, the west shores of the White Sea,2* The first, steps were taken in June by.theappointment of Major-General Poole, as Allied Commander* in-Chief and by the despatch of a small British force to re-inforce the marines from the battleships and the French and Serbian detachments from the interior of Russia who were then at Murmansk, Petchenga and -Kandalaksha,In July it became apparent that the Czechs would not be able to arrive at any early date at Archangel, but it was nevertheless decided that this port should be held by the Allies for the other reasons stated.
.11352.Occupation cf 3.    Accordingly at the beginning if August, General Archangel.I&quot;&quot;&quot; Poole taking With him a portion of the Murmansk forcesand a battalion of French infantry which had recently reached him made a hold and highly successful descent on Archangel (Aug*2.)      He pushed southwards along the railway and along the Dwina, but owing to the delay in the arrival of the further forces promised he was not strong enough to progress any great distance,,Situation at   4.     Meanwhile the force at Murmansk was. only reinforced lairmanak.by one battalion of (Italian) infantry, (Sept,2.) andthe Serbian troops proved themselves of doubtfuldiscipline and reliability, while the Karelian leviesfrom Kern announced their decision only to fight intheir own district.Enemy 5,    The enemy had not been passive during the monthsactivities.of June, July and August; troops were poured into Finland. (The present number is estimated at about 55,000)*   No effort was spared to organise the Finnish Army and to force the Finnish Government into waif with the Allies, but fortunately these efforts have met with little success,   nevertheless the preparations of roads, light railways and bases have been pushed on with the greatest energy and it is apparent that the enemy has the following objectives -(1) To seize the Southern section of the Mirman railway from Zvanka to Petrozavodsk,(2) To cut the kurman railway from the direction ofI Kajana.(3) To attack Pechenga from the direction of Rovaniemi,Question of    6.    In these circumstances Major General Maynard, who had evacuation ofPechenga. been appointed to command at Murmansk, stated thatwith
with tho small effectives at his command he could not guarantee his hold on Pechenga and recommended its evacuation,,&apos;To this policy the Admiralty took the very strongest objection, on the grounds that our evacuation inferred enemy occupation, with the result that by the Spring is should have to cope with an organized, well-protected submarine base which would be an infinite source of danger not only to our Archangel communications but to our Atlantic shipping,, Further it was realized that such evacuation would immensely lower our prestige in Russia, and produce deplorable political results *General Maynard was therefore Instructed to report the minimum reinforcements he would require to guarantee his hold cn the whole northern Murman Coast.He asked for4 battalions of infantry., 2 Machine Gun Companies * 1 Stokes Mortar Battery, 2, 4,5&quot; howitzer batteries, 1, 18 pr, battery.These demands were concurred in by the General, Staff, and after consideration the War Cabinet decided they should be furnished from Home Defence forces.     The necessary preparations are now in hand and it is expected that a portion will sail in a fortnight and the remainder in a month from now.The communications with Archangel will thus be secured.
1$ (4.ation at      7.   With regard to the situation at Archangel and the actionangel.      to be taken by General Poole1 s forces operating thence, it mastbe realised that the circumstances under which the originalv decision of the Supreme Ear Council was taken have radicallyaltered, in two directions(1) The 20,000 Czechs on which General Poole relied for the defence of the Northern Ports, and to the rallying of pro-Ally Russians, have not reached Archangel, from which they are separated by a Bolshevik force estimated at from 16,000 to 18,000 strong.   This force may be reinforced by German elements. The local situation in North Russia is thereby changed very much to our disad-vantage, more especially at Mirmansk, where the position gives rise for anxiety.(2) On the other hand, by a stroke of unexpected good fortune, thanks to the energy, patriotism and fighting spirit of the Czechs, the Allies are now in control of the whole Siberian railway from Vladivostock to the Urals.   They have thereby the power of re constituting a fighting front in Russia which will immediately and materially influence the strategical situation of the Central Powers to their disadvantage, and re-act favourably on the Western Front.The presence of the Czechs-Slovak forces in EuropeanRussia, Ill-equipped and weak as they are, Is already causingconcern to the Germans, who are now concentrating troops roundKharkov and Bielgorod, in order to safeguard the ImportantDonetz Coal Basin *   T/hen re-equipped and rested, the ooncen-tration of the whole Czech Army on the Volga front, supportedI by such Allied detachments as are available and the re-organisedelements of the Russian Army, which even now number some 80,000men, will create a serious menace to the enemy, already hamperedby the lawlessness of the Ukraine and the Insecurity of a longline of communications.   By next Spring a fighting front canbe re-constituted In Russia, formidable enough to force theenemy to divert troops in considerable strength from theTfestem front at a time when the maximum Allied effort will bemade.    This factor may well go far to render that effortdecisive.8.
1 9 Ploo5.8.    The situation of the Czech)-Slovaks in Hussia hasbeen dealt with in a separate Note (0.1/172/494), in whichstress is laid on the necessity of a junction being effectedbetween them and General Poole *   It must be realised thatthe Czechs have been subjected to a severe trial during thelast few months and are now tired.       Unless speedilyreinforced and supplied with the necessary warm clothing,equipment and stores with which to face the Russian winter.there will be considerable danger of their relinquishingtheir offensive efforts and drifting away Eastwards witha view to regaining Europe. To counteract thistendency it Is necessary for General Poole&apos;s force tobe able to- push forward uninterruptedly and stretch outa band to them before the winter sets in.Tlx forces at his disposal are now:-5 battalions of Infantry. (i.e. 3 American, arrived Sept. 4. 1 British &apos;       &quot;      Aug. 26. 1 French1 battalion of ongineers (American) Details (British, French, Serb a) equivalent to perhaps i battalion. 1 battery 18pdr. manned by mixed British and Russian.The enemy forces at present are a rabble of Bolshevists supported  by Germans, but they are very well provided with Machine guns and munitions *This force will increase in numbers and quality further south and is likely to be reinforced by German elements.To ensure the junction with the C2echo-Slovaks the following courses of action are essential:-(l). To push out from Archangel and to hold as great a length as possible of the only two lines of approach, i.e. the Vologda railway and the Dwina river.
sary6, 133(2) To occupy the comparatively civilised and well pop-ulated districts round Vologda and thus establish touch with the large pro-ally elements near Yaroslav.(5) To control the Vologda-Viatica and Kotlas-Viatka linesof railway along which the Czechs can advance to meet ua.9, To carry out the above we estimate the following minimumforce is required(1)   to cover Vologda and the 4 battalionsRailway towards Viatka -       4 batteries artillery,(2)   to secure Kotlas and control      2 battalions of railway towards Via-oka -       2 batteries.(3)   in reserve - 2 battalions2 batteries^(4)   on L, of C. and to watchKargopol-Plesetskaya post 2 battalions,road -Total 10 battalions, 8 batteries with addition of aircraft, engineers, etc.To the above must be added the Russian levies, largely composed of officers and old soldiers whose numbers will increase as the Allied treops increase, provided they are strong enough to act offensively and can penetrate the country dispensing food and establishing order.This estimate of force Is based on the report of two officers who have been sent from Archangel to express to the Versailles Council the views held by General Poole and by other allied military representatives, in North Russia.The reinforcements required to make up this total, namely, five battalions of infantry and six batteries of artillery, should leave western Europe not later than the end of September,   The Admiralty expect that it will be possible, with the Ice-breakers now at their disposal, to keep the approaches to Archangel open until December,   Thus it will be possible to send clothing, equipment and stores for the Czechs by this route after a junction has been effected.(Signed)   HENRY WILSON,General Staff,War Office, S.W.1, C.I.G.S.9th September, 1918.
