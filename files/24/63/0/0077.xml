GOVLRihloNT,WA.lv CABINET, PROPAGANDA   IN   ENEMY   COUNTRIES,G.T. 5677.Copy of Note by secretary of State for foreign affairs, (151047/^/50)The Secretary of State for foreign Affairs has had under consideration the letter from the Secretary of the Enemy Propaganda Department at Crewe House, G.T.549S, enclosing the various reports agreed to at the Inter-allied Conference on Propaganda held in London in ^ugust last.2, Mr. Baliour assumes that the views of the Foreign Office are more particularly invited upon the Report of the Committee on Policy, which forms the first enclosure in I.Ir. Hudson&apos;:- letter. Mr. Balfoui considers that this report furnishes an excellent basis on which to conduct propaganda, and it has his general approval,3; With regard, however, to the specific resolutions referred to in the report he yould offer the following observations:-(1)   Although there would appear to be no objection to the recommendation on .page 4 of the report adopted by the Committee for eventual communication to the Jugo-olav Committee., Mr. Balfour assumes that the formal approval thereof by His Majesty rs- Govern-ment is not asked for and is unnecessary,(2)   Similar considerations would apply to the resolution on page 4 of the report to the effect that Representatives of oppressed nationalities should be admitted to the Technical Committee of the next Inter-Allied Conference on Propaganda in Enemy Countries.(3)   The adoption of the resolution on page 5 of the report, proposing a formal declaration in favour of a Jugo-olav State, would, it is assumed, lead to such a declaration being made at the next meeting -of the Supreme V/ar Council.     Mr... Balfour thinks that His MajestyTs Government would be perfectly ready to agree to the terms of this resolution, provided always that it is accepted by the Italian, French and United States Governments.(4)   Although the recommendation which the Committee propose    I on page 6 of the Report should, be communicated to the Polish j.National Council, meets \ 1th the entire concurrence of the kSecretary of rotate for foreign affairs, he Is inclined to dOubt        , Whether the present is- a suitable time for Its announcement. ie feels that,&quot; in view of the activities of the Central lowers to secure the support of the Poles, an announcement of the kind - proposed-, even though made confidentially, would inevitably weaken the hands of the National Committee,1   He would, therefore, utge that, while both the.resolution and recommendation should bi- adopted by H.s MajestyTs Government, no communication of it sSjiould be made for the present, or at any rate until the&apos; German position has become considerably weaker.
(5)   Mr. Balfour considers that the resolution on page 8 of the Report on the subject oi Economic Cooperation can be accepted without alteration;   while that which recommends the constitution of a permanent organisation in order to co-ordinate the Allied policy is for the decision ox Lord Jiorthcliffe alone, it concerns only the internal affairs oi Hie. Lordship&apos;s Department,,4.   As regards the Report of the Committee on Distribution of Propaganda, Mr. Balfour does not consider that he is called on to make any observations on part I which deals entirely with military matte re.     &apos;/ith reference to the last sentence of the recommendation on pages 12 and 13 of the second (Civil) part of the Report, Mr, Baliour feels convinced that His&quot;Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic and Consular Officers will do all they can to meet the wishes of the Committee.     He is net quite certain what exactly is meant by recommendation 8, i.e. &quot;that additional diplomatic support should be given to the members of enemy Propagandist Agencies in neutral countries&quot;, but he will of course see that the foreign Office takes all possible steps to assist the Committee in this matter.5.   The Report of the &quot;Committee on Material would not appear to require any observations from the Foreign Office.FOREIGN O-aFICk,&apos;September 13th 1918.
