Government.    The Contraband Commit tee -is the oldest of tho special organisations connected with the Blockade-nu has been sitting since the latter part of 1914.    She period of its greatest-activity was in the years 191a and 1916, before the out-break of unlimited submarine war and the general embargo on the import Iraae of the Northern ihmtrals.At the suggestion of the Australian Government, our Consul General n Batavia has bean instructed to form an advisory Committee of British radon? resident in Java, who will advise on applications for licences, o export&apos; goods from the Commonwealth to that island. This measure, esides dealing a further blow to suspect firms in Java, will make it fore difficult to store goods there for post-bellum trade with Germany, n&amp; will strengthen our hands if we have at any time to offer oompensa-lon for supplies of Dutch last Indian products.The French Government have already published a decree announcing hat any .neutral vessel which ao-septs a German -safe conduct without he leave of the Allies will be presumed, in the absence of proofs to&apos; e contrary, to be sailing in the interests tot our enemies, and will jherofore bo liable to capture and confiscation.    i t the instance of % e United states the Allies have decided to meXe a declaration on the fibjact of these safe conducts to the Spanish, Uutofc and Scandinavian ovemments.    Our declaration insists that the safe conduct system 8 an illegal threat to ooadem^and destroy any neutral shipping which puses to accept Go man control, and that the tendency of this control ml a be to deprive the vessels and their cargoes of their neutral
character.&apos;    It is interesting to compare /with this declaration theneutral point of view as expressed by the Dutoh Minister of ForeignAffairs in a recant communication to Sir A. Johnstons.    II. Loudenargues in effeot that we have acquired by force the use of more Dutohtonnage than we should ever have obtained with the goodwill of theNetherlands,.and that we have no right to complain if the Dutoh Gov-ornment take the best steps they can to preserve the ships which theystill retain, oven if this course involves severe restrictions on thetrade of the Netherlands with the Allies.     If we persist in refusingto recognise the cafo conducts, the German offor to the neutrals lapsesautomatically.    This is the course which the French Government desirethat the Allies should take.     It is not improbable that the Alliesmay agree as a general rule to condone the acceptance of safe conductsspeciallyjprovided that there is nothing/objeotionable in the German conditions. But H.M. Government consider that Sweden would be violating her agreement with the Allies if she accepted German safe conducts for her vessels.BENMAHK.    &apos; The Danish delegates at Washington have now agreed that nothing shall be exported from Denmark to Germany except the following articles; Butter, Milk, Cheese, Bacon, %gs, Cattle, lasts Fat, Vegetab-les and Deeds, Beer and some other Danish products, Agricultural Machin-sry and Tools, Cryolite.     The maximum quantities which may be exported are rigidly defined in the case of each article.   The Danish Association? will give guarantees that articles imported from Sweden and Norway shall not be re-exported.    It is also arranged that the Danish Govern-lent shall be entitled, failing any special agreement with Great Brit-fin, to charge, for exports of bacon, eggs and dairy produce to the United Kingdom, the average price paid for these goods     Norway and Sweden.    We have asked the United States Government to arrange, before the Agreement is finally signed, for the granting of a Danish loan to ourselves.The Banish delegates are delaying the signature of the Agreement
i. 78Jjith the Allies.    (Eheir motive is not clear.    But the date of sign-Iture is not matorial, since the Viar Trade Board will insist that the greoment shall take effect as from Aug. 15.RUSSIA.    Mr. Lindley has now submitted a revised and increased estim-ts of the more pressing requirements of the Archangel district in re-peot of food.   He asks for 53,000 tons of flour, sugar, rioe, oats,tea ad coffee.    H.M. Government hope that two cargoes of flour will reach rohangel before the middle of September.    All further shipments ofIood will be sent from Amorioa, except a large quantity of fish, which s being despatched with our consent, from lorway to Archangel.SWflBM.     The United States are presenting at Stockholm a serious pro-eat against the recent exports from Sweden to Germany in contravention f the Swedish Agreement.   -The note states that the President reserves tie right to take whatever measures seem appropriate, such as the stopp-Ige of American supplies to Sweden.     She Swedish Government are requir-Jd to give full information as to (a) their obligation to Germanyjader the Goal Agreement and any other Agreements still outstanding, lad (b) Swedish   exports to Germany 3inee the Agreement with the Allies las signed.     It has transpired that the June shipments of phosphoric Iron ore to Germany were in excess of the figure sanctioned &quot;by that Igroement.IMHi^lATO.      3!he Netherlands Isport Company desire to re-open nego-liations in London respecting the Dutch fishing trade. H.M. Government lave stated that an agreement can be concluded on the principles which fere laid down in the earlier discussions;   only amendments of a detailed (ad technical character can be discussed.!     2?he Dutch expect to find that their exportable surplus of Cows pd Horses will be their most valuable asset in the forthcoming negotia-lions for an economic agreement with Germany.    SJheyjwill ask for comp-insation in the shape of potash and other fertilisers!&apos;;. 1 3?hey recognise fiat we shall probably veto any export of Dutch hide si to Germany.
roposal that an Allied Black List for Switzerland shall be recognised, o far as concerns the distribution in Switzerland of goods from Allied ountries.     The S.S.S. Agreement stipulates that no firm which was on fie Swiss commercial register before the beginning of the war should be acklisted by the Allies.    But the French Government have long been essing gfor the abrogation of this clause;   and the new proposal goes )me way towards meeting their demand.     It is probable that the Federal iiinoil, even if they accept the recommendation of the will claim) be consulted in .the compilation of the list.The Italian Government are said to be on the point of releasing for iss consumption 15,000 bales of cotton ?/hich are at present lying in aly and are believed to be German ewned.    H.M.. Government are asking e Italian Government not to complete this transaction before it is made ear that no enemy interest wouid be directly or indirectly benefited, aly can hardly expect her Allies to facilitate her own imports of oott$ the stocks which she already controls are released without due pre-utiori.SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.

CARLESS DAVIS.PAIN.    The Spanish.Minister for Foreign Affairs is apparently prepared o make a firm stand on the submarine question, and to insist on seizing German interned ship for every Spanish ship whloh is sunk.   The German overnment have adopted the ingenious expedient of offering to sell the ttterned ships to the Italian Government.   It is not altogether oertain hat the Spanish Cabinet will support the Minister for Foreign Affairs.flTZBRLAID.     The S.B.S. have agreed to submit to the Federal Council a
