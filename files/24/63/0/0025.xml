(This DooHnpent Is the Property r/Confidential.September 4, 1918.Political mteHigence Department,I?0HBIGE OFFICE.MBMORATOflonDenmark /005.THE DANISH-ICE LAND 10 AGREUIEHT.This Agreement, fall terms of whioh were published in Copenhagen on the 27th July, is in the form of a draft pro-posal for a Danish-Ioelandic Constitution, which, if ratified, will dome into force on the let December.    The Bill will come bef6re the Danish Rigedag and the Icelandic Althing and has further to be submitted to a plebiscite in Iceland in accord-anoe with the Icelaudio Fundamental law of June 19th, 1915. If it is passed it will remain in force until the year 1940. After that year, either the Rigsdag or the Althing Can at any time demand that tho negotiations for the revision of the Law be recommenced.    It may be taken for granted that the Rigsdag will pass the Bill and as 38 out of 40 members of the Althing have voted in favour of the proposal, it would appear oertain that unless public opinion in Iceland veers completely round -an unlikely contingency - the plebiscite will result in an overwhelming majority in support of it.Prom information received from a very reliable source in Iceland it appears that satisfaction there with the settlement of the dispute is universal and that it is recognised that Den-mark has conceded to Iceland all that can be reasonably expect -ed;   further that the majority of the Icelanders feel that the tima has not yet ooms for Iceland to stand by herself, and that as her financial position does not warrant complete sepa-ration yet, or while the TIar lasts (and possibly for some timeto come), it may still be useful to enjoy the protection of Denmark.-1-/Taldng
Taking into consideration the fact-: that the Icelanders have, generally speaking, aspired to a personal union only with full oontr^l of their own foreign policy, it must occasion some surprise that the proposal as it stands should have been receiv-ed in Iceland with such complete satisfaction.    The Bill is manifestly a oomproiaise and. the Danes would appear, taking into consideration the fact that they are not in a position to im- . pose their will on Iceland, to have made a good bargain.    It is true that Iceland is to be a &quot;free and sovereign state&quot; and that Ice3and is to obtain her own commercial flag;   that al-though treaties between Denmark and foreign countries, already published, are to remain binding in Iceland, future treaties will not be binding on her exoept with the consent of her own authorities and that Danish financial assistance on a oonsider-able scale is to be accorded to Iceland.    Yei it is clearly stated in the Agreement that Denmark is to conduct Iceland&apos;s foreign affairs with the advioe and assistance at the Daiish Foreign Office of an Icelandic offioial and that Danish Mini-sters and Consuls will continue to represent Iceland in foreign countries although by special arrangement With the Danish Mini-ster f*r Foreign Affairs, the Icelandic Government will be per-mltted at their twn expense, to appoint delegates for the oon-duei oi negdtiat iens regarding matters specifically Icelandic...Hkere are in addition one it two points in the proposal which would seem to place Iceland in a worse ptsitiin tnan bo* fore.    For instanoe, Danish citizens are to enjoy in Iceland in every respect the same rights as Icelandic citizens bom in Iceland and vice versa, Instead of as heretofore being ob* liged to reside five years in the country before acquiring franchise rights.    In theory this arrangement iB equitable and irreproachable.    In practice it must work tut otherwise. Denmark has about &amp;! million inhabitants, Icelsnd 150,000 - a/porportion
proportion of more than PA to 1.    Icelanders who take on Danish citizenship can, therefore, manifestly to no approoiaslo extent play an important r^lo in tho political and economic life of Don-mark,    On the other hand, the daroger that Icelandic nationality will gradually bo swamped by Danish immigration appears to be obvious, more especially as Earmark has signified her intention of helping Iceland to develop her eoonomio resourooc.    She will holp hor with money and, presumably, mon and the latter will not automatioally, on taking up residence in Iceland, become Icolandic citizens.Another point - a minor one perhaps - is that relative to the fishorios question.    Hore again there is to be equality with regard to fishing rights in Danish ana Ieelaudio waters and the Icelandic fishing, one of the main seuroes of Icelandic wealth, may, eloquently in the future, should the Bill become law, be exploited ad libitum by the Danish fishermen.It has been hinted so often in Icelandic circles that tho Icelanders would break with Lexmark Unless the latter agreed to virtual separation and osnsecuent emancipation of - Iceland from Danish control that ono wonders at the Icelandic acceptance of suoh proposals.    It may be that the Danes, more particularly Mr, Bsrgbjerg who has been working in intimate contact with tho Icelandic Socialists, havo succeeded in persuading the Icolan-dor-3 that at the present time a really independent Iceland would ho at the mercy of any great power with predatory in-stiucts-, and so persuaded them to agree to terms which are- to their disadvantage.    Certainly they havo been told that if Iceland -wishes to link up m^re closely with hor own kith and kin and thus extend tho scheme for Scandinavian co-operation, it is essential for her tc maintain her connection with Denmark.With regard to press comments in the Scandinavian coun-tries, the Danish Government organ &quot;Po litikon&quot; naturally shows/great
ogreat satisfaction at tho amicable sufctloraent.    In a carorfully-worded, article on the 87 uh July it points out the advantages which will accruo to Denmark.    Such an article was, from the Government point of view, callod for in view of tho attitudo of tho Danish Conservative press, which, as the Conservations refused to nominate a delegate for the negotiations, naturally takes the point of view that the Danish concessions are too far-reaching.    There was some friction while the negotiations were going on between the Danish Government press and the Hor-wegian papers, the latter boing accused of displaying a mali-cious joy as regards the difficult position in which Denmark has been placed.    But articles in the Norwegian &quot;Norske m-telligenssedler&quot;, &quot;Dagbladet&quot; (July 28th), and &quot;Tidens Tegn&quot; (July 21st) have since been written evidently with the inten-tion of placating tho Danes.    The last pa$er even gees so far .as to write enthusiastically about the results obtained and to oon&amp;ratulate both countrIns concerned.In the Swedish press there has been little comment as the papers evidently foared to offend Danish susceptibilities by giving too warm a welcome to tho &quot;fourth Scandinavian state&quot;. The Conservative &quot;Stockholms Dagblad&quot; thinks that if the new proposal becomes law Denmark also will have her &quot;Union quea-tion&quot;.    It further adds that too many concessions have been made te Iceland and presumes that the Danes folt it imperative to satisfy Icelandic claims in view of tho schemes of &quot;oertain great powers&quot;, which would press Iceland into a wholly separa-tist policy.    &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot; (Sweden), on the other ljfen&amp;, welcomes the proposals and regards the peacefully won in&amp;epen-dOnce of Iceland as a proof that tho &quot;solf-determination of tho peoples&quot; is not a mere empty phrase.
