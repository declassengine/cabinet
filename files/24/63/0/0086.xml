11SECRET.MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.Week ending Wednesday, September 11, 1918,PART I-ACTION TAKEN.Inter-Allied Food Council.Committee of Representatives. In accordance with the decision of the Food Council a freight committee of the Committee of Representatives has been established to deal with shipping questions as regards all food imports. The first meeting of the committee was held on Monday, 9th September, and was attended by representatives of the Allied Maritime Transport Council and Ministry of Shipping.A meeting of the Purchasing Committee was held on Wednesday, 11th September.The programme of food importation for the cereal year 191.8-19 has received farther consideration, and two letters on the subject have been received from the Allied Maritime Transport Council containing their views as to the amount of tonnage -likely to be available.The execution of the programme is being commenced on the basis of the quantities covered by the priority figures which were submitted by the Committee of Representatives to the Allied Maritime Transport Council, it being understood that the figures are subject to review at any time, on the motion of any country if the circumstances render this necessary.The Allied Maritime Transport Council state that the total arrivals of foodstuffs in the three European Allied countries during the four months September to December, 1918, inclusive may be estimated at about 6  million tons excluding military oats, or 7 million tons including military oats. An export programme showing countries of origin and the quantities of each commodity to be obtained from each country on the above basis is now in course of preparation.The Allied Maritime Transport Council also expressed the view as regards military oats that the programme of importation adopted during the past cereal year should continue until the matter has been further considered. This procedure is being adopted for the present, but the military authorities are being requested to reconsider their oats importation programme in relation to the supplies of tonnage and oats which are available. &apos;Bacon, Earn, and Lard.-Green bacon suitable for boiling was recently made available at a maximum retail price of Is. Sd. a lb. By an Order amending the Bacon, Ham, and Lard (Prices) Order, 1918, made on the 6th September, it has now been arranged for such bacon to be sold when pale dried or smoked at a maximum retail price of Is. 10d. a lb. *Cereals.-The Small and Additional Acreage Order, 1918, dated the 4th September, 1918, authorises a person whose total acreage under cultivation in the year 1918 does not exceed, in Great Britain one acre, in Scotland five acres, or in Ireland 10 acres, to use the cereal crop (other than wheat) harvested on such land in the year 1918 for the purpose of feeding any live stock belonging to him.A person who in England or Wales has ploughed permanent grass land in excess of any amount of such land directed to be ploughed, for cultivation in the year 1918, by any directions of the Executive Committee given prior to March 9, 1918 (therein called excess land) may use for the purpose of feeding any live stock belonging to him, such part of his total cereal crop (other than wheat) harvested in the year 1918 as shall be certified by the Food Controller to be equal in amount to the cereal crop (other than wheat) harvested on his excess land in the year 1918, provided that he has complied v/ith the conditions prescribed in the Order. ANothing in the Order authorises the feeding of any live stock in contravention of the Horses (Rationing) Order, 1918.Cheese. The quantity of Canadian cheese now on the way has been increased to 5,061 tons, but no further arrivals in France for the War Office have yet been reported.A  (33)6407-2   Pkl   140  9/18  E&amp;S AControl of Supplies and Prices.&apos;
2900 boxes of clieese, ex S.S. &quot; City of Vienna &quot; stranded off Halifax, Have been shipped per S.S. &quot; Kildonan Castle &quot; to the United Kingdom. A small supply of cheese from the United States is still coming forward.Cocoa.-Shipments of cocoa show considerable improvement. Since September 1st, 4,500 tons have arrived ; 3,000 tons are reported to he afloat from British West Africa, and 800 tons from the British West Indies.Coffee. The Admiralty Marshall continues to supply the coffee market from stocks in respect of which the President of the Prize Court has made orders for sale.Dried Fruits. The S.S. &quot; Kassiani &quot; with 2,300 tons of currants has arrived at Bristol, and the S.S. &quot; Warturn &quot; with 3,600 tons of currants has arrived at Liverpool.The Treasury have informed the War Office that they can only sanction the purchase of 0,000 tons of Spanish dried fruits to be divided between that Department and this Ministry. As the Army requires 8,000 tons of Spanish dried fruits to enable them to reduce the jam ration, this Ministry will be unable to effect any purchases in Spain, and will have to rely on private importations.Feeding-stuffs. The Controller of Horse Supplies and Transport has made urgent representations in favour of some action being taken in order to prevent a repetition of the state of things last year, when it was practically impossible to buy any home-&apos; grown oats for the feeding of town horses. The Home Cereals Committee are considering, in consultation with other Departments, whether any action can usefully be taken in order to render a better supply of oats available for this purpose.Margarine. It has been announced that the weekly ration of fats is to be increased at the end of next month from the present allowance of 5 ozs. of margarine and butter to 4 ozs. of margarine and 2 ozs. of butter. To provide this ration 4,400 tons of margarine will be required weekly. The manufacturing capacity of the country is now equal to turning out 5,955 tons weekly.The margarine now on the market is of the highest quality, equal to butter as a wholesome article of. food, and in respect of keeping its superior. It is made entirely of oils and animal fats.   The ingredients include : Palm kernel oil - - - - 45 per cent.Coco-nut oil - - - - - 15     ,,Ground-nut oil - - - - 10      ,,Cottonseed oil - - - - 10      ,,Animal fats - - - - - 10      ,,Meat. The public have been well prepared for the increase in price and the reduction in the ration, which come into force together on September 22nd. There will, no doubt, be grumbling, but there will be no real hardship, as although the quantity of fresh meat available will be the lowest allowed up to the present under the Rationing Scheme, bacon is now ration-free, while the equivalent weight of other commodities on the coupon has been increased from time to time.The limited supplies of canned meat likely to be available are to be distributed under the control of the Ministry, in order that the meat may only reach the classes of consumers to whom it is an absolute necessity.On September 22nd it is hoped to bring the new Pig Control Order into force ; this will, complete the work of bringing all classes of meat under absolute control.Milk. The Committee appointed to advise on the financial arrangements in connection with the control of milk distribution has finished its work, and will report to the Food Controller very shortly.The Food Controller has decided that the wholesale price to producers of winter milk in Great Britain shall be 2s. 3d. a gallon. The English Board of Agriculture have approved this price, and the approval of the Scottish Board is awaited.Potatoes. As the result of a conference with representatives of the wholesale potato trade at Covent Garden on Monday, all objections to the scheme for the distribution of potatoes of the 1918 crop have been removed. It was unanimously resolved that the Executive of the National Federation of Wholesale Merchants would recommend the trade to accept the Ministry&apos;s proposals and would do their best to carry out the scheme successfully.The Joint Commission appointed by the Food Controller and the President of the Board of Agriculture under the chairmanship of Mr. Rigby Swift, K.C., M.P., to assess the prices of the 1918 potato crop, commenced its sittings on the 3rd instant. Evidence has already been taken in 16 counties.
3Oils and Fats. The Tallow and Dripping (Restriction of Export and Import) Order, 1918, dated September 10th, 19.18, the object of which is simply to minimise transport, prohibits the export of tallow and dripping from Ireland to Great Britain, and vice versa, except under license.Tea. At a meeting of the Tea Advisory Committee the method of distribution of the China tea purchased by the Ministry of Food was discussed. It was decided that further arrivals of (Jhina tea should be awaited before any China tea was put into distribution.The Tea (Licensing of Wholesale Dealers) Order, 1918, dated the 10th September, 1918, requires all persons dealing wholesale in the United Kingdom to be licensed by the Ministry.Organised Distribution.Rationing. Owing to the difficulty of disposing of venison against coupons, especially in Scotland, it has been decided that this food may be obtained without coupon as from September 8th.National Kitchens. In view of the scarcity of fuel, it has been decided that the development of the National Kitchens movement cannot be confined to the towns, but must be extended to the rural districts. It is thought village kitchens, established in a parish hall or school, would provide soup, good puddings, fish dishes, and other things which organized marketing and economical cookery would make available at low prices.The Inverness National Kitchen has been utilised for some time for the manufacture of jam, which, when made, has been distributed to applicants at the rate of 6 lbs. per head in the case of households which received no sugar for jam-making, and at a lesser rate to those which had a certain amount of home-made jam. Incidentally the venture proved a financial success.Ministry of Labour Report. This report indicates a state of irritation in labour circles, not caused by food troubles or directed against the food administration, but generally ready to take offence.The action of the Government in proclaiming the Co-operative workers&apos; dispute appears to have had wholly beneficial results. The majority of the workers never stopped work; such stoppages as occurred have in some instances already ceased; and it is expected that a normal state of things will recur almost immediately.In some districts, it is suggested that the fats ration is inadequate, and in Cornwall the lard ration has been found insufficient.Enforcement of Orders.There is a decrease this week of 190 prosecutions, Ireland having dropped from 304 to 99, which is the lowest number so far reported from Ireland. There is a slight rise in the number reported from England, Scotland, and Wales, the total being 454, with a percentage of convictions of 94, while the percentage of convictions in Ireland is 88.The Divisions showing the greatest number of prosecutions are as follows :  Division. Cases. Convictions.North Western - - - 105 99 per cent.North. Eastern - - - 83 96South West - - - 43 97South Wales - 38 94Scotland West - - - 37 97     &quot;   ;Prosecutions occurred under 66 Orders, notably the. Milk (Summer Prices) Amendment Order, 1918, the Eationing Order, 1918, and the Flour (Restriction) Ireland Order, 1918.The Soft Fruit (Sales) Amendment Order, 1918, appears for the first time in the Prosecutions List.The offence of the unlawful use of a ration book appears to be on the increase.
4&apos;    PART II.-tSUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.In the following paragraphs and in Table F the means are afforded for a com-parison of: the food position at the beginning of the cereal year 1918-19 with tTjat which existed on September 1st,1 1917. For this purpose the best estimates of the home crops have been used, but these are subject to revision and more reliable figures will not be available for several weeks. Assuming their approximate accuracy, the cereal position may be described as similar to that on September 1st in last year. The increased acreage put under grain counterbalances the smaller quantity of grain imported and warehoused. Oats is high while maize is extremely low. Rice has more than doubled and stands at a very high figure.Turning to meat and general provisions, meat, if all kinds be included, shows a slight fall, while bacon and ham have more than doubled. If these be taken together there has been an increase of about 50 per cent.   The stocks of fats are somewhat less.Sugar stocks are good, though here it must be remembered that importation from the East will be comparatively light; hence the necessity for a large stock (amounting to 15 weeks&apos; supply), if a reduction in the ration is to be avoided. Tea stocks, as far as.stock in bond is concerned, have doubled, though looking at total tea stocks it should be noticed that stock out of bond is considerably less than was the case at this time last year.   In coffee and cocoa there has been a great fall.The stocks calculated in terms of weeks consumption are stated in tabular form Wheat -        -        -     27j Butter and margarine    -       2Meat  -        -        -       2\ Potatoes -        - 52Bacon and hams       -       5 Sugar    -        -        -      15Cheese -        -    &apos;. 7   - Tea      -        -       - -     16It might be added that the potato crop in all probability will provide supplies considerably greater than those required for the consumption in a normal year.Having regard to the above, something may be added as to the prospects of the year. Certain favourable considerations present themselves. In the first place, experience both as to methods of supply and the means of distribution has been gained from the difficulties and efforts of the past year. In the second place, the harvests of both North America and the Argentine are gOod. On the other hand, it should be noticed that tonnage difficulties are great, and. diminished shipping space is already threatened. Again, the consumption of the Allied forces has necessarily increased. It is probable that the civilian demand for meat will have to be met to an even larger extent than last year from home-fed meat. The pressure on this supply may be relieved by more plentiful supplies of bacon, but, on the other hand, the home live stock is likely to suffer from inadequate supplies of feeding-stuffs.There are two outstanding difficulties, the one the supply of feeding-stuffs, the other the rising prices of the necessaries of life.Imports.The new cereal year has not commenced well. Of the Tjrincipal foods, only sugar, bacon, lard and condensed milk were received in sufficient quantities during the week ending September 7th to enable current consumption to be met Avithout drawing on stocks. The aggregate, 174,600 tons, was 66,700 tons lower than in the previous week and 20,000 tons less than in the opening week of the cereal year 1917-18. The total of all cereals, including wheat, was 107,300 tons against 144,200 tons a year ago. Wheat and flour together fell on the week, from 93,300 tons to 89,700 tons. In equivalent grain the decline was, from 105,700 tons to 97,700 tons, or 8,000 tons. Other cereals were all lower; since the beginning of January only . 606,000 tons of maize have been received against 1,083,000 tons in the corresponding period of 1917.Beef fell from 9,800 tons to 2,700 tons. Mutton and meat unenumerated were also lower, bringing the total for butchers&apos; and preserved meat to but 5,400 tons against 18,600 tons in the previous week and 11,800 tons in the week ending September 8th, 1917. Bacon and hams rose from 13,900 tons to 19,800 tons. Lard, cheese, and condensed milk, although lower than in the week before^, were all higher than a year ago.   No butter at all arrived.   Sugar was an average import.Imports of oilseeds, nuts and kernels during. August at 89,300 tons, though slightly lower than in July, were much higher than in August 1917. Arrivals of cake were again negligible. Receipts of oil, both fish and vegetable, were much above average; total arrivals in the first eight months of this, year have been in 11 128,000 tons against 60,300 tons in the corresponding months of 1917.
Consumption,Meat.-i.Li recent weeks the increase in home supplies that was expected has been realised, but the movement of stock to the markets has been retarded by the scarcity of agricultural labour at the harvest season. The issues of imported meat have fallen from the high point reached in the middle of August, but the net result of the two, i movements has been a steady increase in the total consumption of meat. It is significant that the increase is concurrent with the greater proportion of home-led supplies: Average Weekly Consumption.	Hume.       &apos;	Imported.	Total.^our week5 ended : 	Tons.	Tons.

Index numbers of consumption based on returns - from a large number of co-operative stores and multiple shops for the four weeks ending August 31st, 1918, are given in Table E. For the third month in succession sales in bacon and hams have fallen; during August the drop was 9 per cent. After the sharp rise recorded for July the consumption of lard diminished by nearly 7 per cent., and is now again below that of a year ago ; stocks have accumulated to nearly three weeks&apos; supply.The actual weights sold, included in the returns, are shown in the following table : 	Four Weeks ended 			August 31st, 19.18.

6Stocks.&quot;As yet only Very provisional estimates of the new harvest are available. The ifigures shown in Table F. for cereals are consequently subject to a big margin of error and may need, considerable revision when the yields of the home crops are known with, greater accuracy. On the information at present to hand, the wheat position is hardly satisfactory. In spite of the inclusion of a harvest which has been taken as exceeding that of 1917 by 30 per cent., the stock on September 1st&apos; is approximately 150,000 tons lower than a year ago. Consumption can thus be continued at the -same . rate as during the past cereal /year only : by , increased importation, which, is /unlikely, or by large drafts on reserve.The stocks held of, the principal cereals at the commencement of each cereal year -since the outbreak of war are given below.: Stocks&apos; of Cereals.September 1st.1914.1915.v Wheat i Barley i Oats ^Maize MticeTons. 2,656,000 1,750,000 -2,765^000101,000Tons. 2,782,000 1,^98,000 3,094,000216,0001916.1917.1918.Tons. 2,599,000 1,470,000 2,968,000128^000 85,000&quot;Tons. 3,290,000 1,427,000 3.469,000 102,000 107,000(Tons. 3,147,000 1,416,000 3,824,000 36,000212,000* Figures not available.Against a fall of 40,700 tons during August 1917 stocks of oilseeds at ports and in the hands of manufacturers fell only 8,600 tons during&apos;last month. They are now .125,000 tons lower than a year ago. The quantity of cake held in reserve has risen, but is still 56,000 tons lower than on September 1st, 1917. The deficiency that has to be faced is much greater tha n appears from this figure, for a year ago farmers held stocks amounting to probably some hundreds of thousands of tons, and 1 these stocks have now been almost entirely consumed.\With.! the exception of butchers&apos; meat and butter, stocks of meat arid provisions are good. Bacon has risen to 80,600 tons, and cheese to 25,500 tons. Both are noticeably higher than last year. Condensed milk increased 6,000 tons ; a comparative figure for a year;ago is not available.Sugar stocks rose 89,000 tons during August, thus practically assuring supplies for the winter months. Tea, coffee, and cocoa taken together fell nearly 1,000 tons, and are 48,000 tons. less, than on September 1st, 1917.Prices.Wholesale. --Apart from a fall in the Gazette price of &apos; British &apos; wheat from 74s, Sdj to 72s. Zd. per quarter, wholesale prices are practically unchanged.Retail.-The general level of retail prices of principal foodstuffs Avas 1 per cent, lower on September 1st than.a month earlier. This was due to a dropiin the price of potatoes partly counteracted by increases in the prices of milk and cheese, the remaining articles showing either no change. or movements of less than L per cent. The fall in the price of potatoes amounted to 2\d, per 7lbs., or,22 per cent., but the price on September 1st was still 20 per cent, higher than a year before. The average price of milk was 6fdL per quart, showing an increase of 4 per cent, on August and of 21 per cent, on that of September 1st 1917. Cheese rose nearly 2 per cent., the price being now everywhere at the new maximum (Table G).The only changes during August in the retail prices of the subsidiary, foods set out in Table H. were, increases of fdper. lb.; in sago and. tapioca.
