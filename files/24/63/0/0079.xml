OF AGRICUL1URE AND FISHERIES.\1FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,Tt avoid delay, address all crmmunications to &apos;-       The Director General.72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1).Referenet No-,11th September, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of theFood Production Department for the week ended 10th Septembergreater part of the country and rain caused considerable inter-ruption of the remaining harvest work.   Reports of some early threshings show that the yield of wheat in certain localities is not likely quite to fulfil the expectations of the few weeks just before harvest.Herefordshire - Reports show that the harvest in this county is extremely good, and that as a consequence any feeling of irritation against the policy of ploughing up permanent grass has disappeared.Nottinghamshire - Prizes for the best crops grown on newly broken&apos; grass ^.and in the Bingham district have been presented by the Chairman of the District Sub-Committee.   The judges reported that they examined about 1,000 acres of crops on the newly ploughed grassland and failed to find any land ordered to be ploughed that was not suitable for the purpose.   About 480 acres of wheat, which was inspected, was much more healthy than might have been expected for a first crop, averaging about 4 quarters per acre.   The oats on a similar acreage averaged 6 quarters per acre.   The leastThe Weather and Condition of Crops.The weather during the past week was variable over theLOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.- 1 -
successful crop on the land inspected appears to have been potatoes and tho judges attributed this to want of knowledge on part of tho growers, but considered that tho land was suitable the growing of this crop.Prosecutions - A Greek residing at V/orthing and carrying on bus in the City has boon prosecuted and convicted for failing to co with an Order to plough up 11 acres of land in West Sussex.   The defendant was fined  15 and  10 costs.   This decision will probal have a useful effect, as another Bench of Magistrates in the c had practically refused to convict in any case of the kind.     In Essex a farmer at Layer-de-la-Haye has been fined  25 and 15 guineas costs for failure to comply with an order to plough up acres.Changes of Tenancy - A memorandum has been prepared acquainting Agricultural Executive Committees with the legal position of the quitting tenant who has broken up grassland or taken two white crops in succession in contravention of his contract of tenancy, is pointed out that if the outgoing tenant suffers loss owing tc not being able to recover the value of his cultivations from the incoming tenant he may claim compensation under the Corn Product (Amendment) Act, 1918.   It is also suggested that where payment these matters cannot be arranged with the landlord or the incorn: tenant the Committee should take possession of the land which requires cultivation and carry it on by the outgoing tenant as their agent, the value of the cultivations being recovered by ti on withdrawal, from the incoming tenant.Determination of Tenancies - During the week 12 Orders have bee made by the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farmi in respect of .1,219 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Allotments - At Liskeard (Cornwall) 60% of the 1,075 householde are cultivating gardens, and in addition 151 people are cultiva- 2 -
12 acres of allotments.   A number of householders also rent potato patches from farmers In the district.An inspection of the Show composed of exhibits from the allotments of employees of Messrs. Selfridges, Oxford Street, was carried out during the week, and certificates from the Department were awarded to the most meritorious exhibits from the food production point of view.   The exhibits all round were very fair considering that a great deal of the produce was grown in the very immediate suburbs of London.Shows at Middlesbrough and Lee Green, Eltham (Army Service Corps Food Produce Exhibition) were attended during the week.   At the latter place an inspection of several depot gardens was carried out.   This land two years ago consisted of very undesirable clay strata, but by constant working, and the incorporation of all available vegetable matter, good crops of well matured vegetables are now being produced.During the week claims for compensation have been dealt with for an area of 13 acres.      221.10.1. was claimed and  128. 5. 0. recommended in settlement.FruitSection - Fruit plantations at Salehurst (Sussex) and Marden (Kent) on whioh special spraying systems and plant had been installed were inspected during tho past week.50 demonstrations of tho preservation of fruit and vegetables have been held during the week, and special exhibitions have been attended at St. Helen&apos;s Merthyr Tydfil, Chatham and Exeter. Marketing - The Horticultural Sub-Committees for Merioneth, Carnarvon and Flintshire have decided to work in conjunction with the North Wales Fruit and Vegetable Society for the purpose of marketing surplus produce.Arrangements have been made for the issue of acetic acid to pickle manufacturers for use in the preservation of red cabbage which would otherwise have been wasted.
TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspections.   The following are instances of inspections made of farms taken over by Agricultural Executive Committees Drayton Manor, Warwickshire.   This farm, 462 acres in extent, 380&apos; acres of which are arable) was taken over by the Committee early last year.   It was then entirely over-run with thorn &quot;bush&quot;, havinj been left to &quot;tumble down&quot; 30 years ago, and been allowed to go from bad to worse ever since.   The first operation of the Committel was to clear the land, which they did by cutting down the &quot;bush&quot; in the first instance, and then systematically uprooting the stump) with steam tackle.   In this way nearly 100 acres were cleared in 1917 and cropped with corn and potatoes.   An additional 270 acres have been dealt with during the summer, and will be sown with whei this autumn.   The hedges, which had run wild and could hardly be distinguished from tho &quot;bush&quot;, have all been cut down to the grow and many hundreds of yards of ditches have; been opened and clearei When the Committee&quot; took over the farm it was practically worthless but the member of the Committee in charge of the operations is of opinion that when possession is relinquished there will be no difficulty in letting the farm for  1 an acre.   The whole of the work of reclamation and cultivation has been done by prisoner lab( Old Hall Farm, Delves Green, Staffordshire.   This farm (113 acres was taken over last March in a deplorably foul condition, having been very badly neglected by the previous tenant.   The only crop on the farm was 13 acres of wheat, which had been sold standing f  99.   Since taking over the farm the Committee have employed steai tackle on the whole of the arable land that had not been sown, am most of it has been ploughed and cultivated nine  imes during the summer,   The land is now fairly clean and will be sown with wheat this autumn.   The ditches have been cleaned out, and a consideral) amount of fencing done.- 4 -
23SLABOUR DIVISION.Harvest Labour.   The break in the weather which has delayed harvest work, and increased the area of laid corn has caused additional demands for labour to be received from counties in the north of England anal in North Wales.   Additional men have been allocated to these counties, and it is hoped that the number will be sufficient to complete the harvest work in these districts.   The number of soldiers specially released for harvest and now on farms is 8,548 and in addition, between 4,500 and 5,000 prisoners of war have been loaned temporarily for harvest, and sent out under the scheme for the provision of migratory gangs.Prisoners of War.   In response to representations made by the Department as to the insufficient rations supplied to prisoners of war engaged in agriculture, the War Office have issued instructions providing for a small increase in the ration to enable prisoners to take out each day some food for a mid-day meal.   It is hoped that this concession will meet some of the difficulties which have been experienced in connection with prisoner labour. Threshing Engine Drivers.   Arrangements have been made for the employment of a small number of prisoners on threshing machines.. The War Office have informed the Department that they will endeavour to release on agricultural furlough a number of soldiers who areskilled threshing engine drivers, in order that some of the idlethreshing machines may be got to work.ffOmen^s Branch.Employment.   Reports show that woman labour has been utilised successfully in flax pulling in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Training.   Women are now being, trained In hedging work to meet the Increasing demand for this labour.    Training Centres are being temporarily converted into billeting hostels for the harvesting and potato gangs.Welfare.   The number of Welfare Officers definitely appointed for- 5 -
England to date Is 16.   Two voluntary Welfare Officers and five Deputy Welfare Officers have also been appointed.Arrangements have been made for all girls passing throu London to be met at the station, and it is hoped that temporary hostel accommodation may be obtained for them-A course for Welfare Officers has been arranged, at whi instruction will be given on the working of various legislative enactments&quot; such as the National Health Insurance Act, the Workmen&apos;3 Compensation Act, Health Regulations, etc Women&apos;s Institutes.   An Agricultural Show is becoming one of the usual features of afomen!s Institute.   Reports show that such exhibitions are receiving increased support from the members, and the exhibits Improve each year.CULTIVATION DIVISION.. Tractor Scheme.   The scheme outlined in last week&apos;s report which provides for the loan of tractors to contractors to be worked on ordinary business lines, has been favourably received by the Agricultural Executive Committees to whose notice it has been brought with few exceptions, and a draft scheme has now been sen to all Committees for their consideration.The following statement shows the position with regard to the provision of tractors and ploughs for the week ended 7th September, 1918:-No. consigned - Total No. during week.     with countTractors &apos;......... 32 3,864(54 withdrawn)Ploughs .....(......... 83 4,955Up to 7th September, 1918, 1,990 of the Pordson tractoreleased to Messrs. Henry Ford and Son had been despatched tofarmers....During the week ended 23rd August, 1918, 6,624 acres were ploughed, 1,147 acres were cross-ploughed, and 2,897 acres cultivated.
L t) iSteam Tackle,   The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follov/s:-   ploughed 2,300 acres, cultivated 28,466 acres, harrowed 643 acres, mole-drained 64 acres.     Total 31,473 acres. Arrangements f cr-^1918 Ha vest.   The total number of binders consigned to countios to date is 4/207.   Tractors arc being used very extensively to draw the Department1a binders, and tho reports received show that the work done has been very satisfactory.   Prom July 26th to August 23rd the amount of work done represents 114,795 tractor days 1 work.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Superphosphate.   In view of the heavy demand for basic slag, farmers ..aro being urged to use superphosphate in its place.   Returns from makers show that considerable quantities of superphosphate are on order, but there is a reluctance to take delivery early in tho season.   The works of one of the largest makers in the Mersey district are very much congested owing to this cause, but action Is being taken to remove their stocks to the south west of England. Binder Twine.   Arrangements are now being made with the makers of binder twine for the manufacture of the quantities required for the 1919 harvest and the price to be charged.   Owing to the greatly increased cost of hemp, wages and manufacture, a very substantial addition to the current year&apos;s prices cannot be avoided. Testing of Seeds.   Representations have been made that the supplies of clover seed are likely to bo reduced owing to the difficulty in securing threshing facilities.   Agricultural Executive Committees have, therefore, been urged to encourage farmers who have good crops of clover to save seed from part of their crop, both to meet their own requirements and for sale.   It is hoped that Committees will give assistance in threshing. 1Since the Testing of Seeds Order wa3 issued over 600 seed firms have been visited by tho Inspectors of the Department in order to ensure the carrying out of the requirements of the Order-- 7 -
Seed Wheat,   Tho wheats selected for seed may now be obtained by farmers at the following prices from the Distributing Agents appointed by the Department&apos;:-&quot;Little Joss&quot;    )&quot;Browick&quot;    .     )     97/- per qr. of .504 lbs. f.o.r., ;lRivett&quot; )         &apos;&apos;   &apos; sacks 2s.6d. extra.&quot;Yeoman&quot;- - 110/-&apos; per qr. of 504 lbs. f.o.r.,sacks 2s.6d. extra.Spraying.   Very successful results have attended the Departmentsendeavours to demonstrate the value of /spraying.   A return of salof knapsack spraying machines received from the leading manuf actu:shows that whereas the yearly sales before the war averaged about1,000 machines, those for 1918 amount to 14,579.I am,Sir,&apos;Your obedient Servant,Director-General,The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, .M.P. , -President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.- 3 -
