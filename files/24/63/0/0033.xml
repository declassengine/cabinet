The strike of co-operative wholesale society&apos;s employees has spread.Part TV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. There is no strike of serious importance with the exception of that of co-operative employees.(6.) Not involving Stoppages. With the exception of the dispute in the cotton districts on the question of the &quot; Rota,&quot; there is no very serious dispute now in progress.I.-General Remarks.The Trouble in the Cotton Industry.Iii the month of June IV) 17 the Board of Trade issued the Raw Cotton Order, 1917, and established the Cotton Control Board for its administration. The main object was to regulate the distribution of available cotton so as to minimise the inequalities of supply among the mills. Subsequently power was also taken to limit the amount of machinery which might be worked in any cotton mill. This power was administered by the Control Board, which fixed a normal percentage of machinery which might be employed in each mill and issued licences for the use of further machinery ^ on payment of a levy based on the amount of excess machinery used. The proceeds of this levy were to provide for payment to those operatives who became unemployed by reason of the operations of the Cotton Control Board. These payments were made to both non-unionists and unionists at Trade Union oflBces, and no union unemployment, pay was permitted as an addition to the Control Board&apos;s payments. A system of rotation was introduced, by which permanent unemployment in the case of individuals was avoided. All employees were thus compelled to take their turn. The system was at first criticised but proved in the end to be satisfactory to the operatives. These arrangements were first introduced for thirteen weeks from the 10th September, 1917, and oh the expiration of this period, as a result of the experience gained, the levy rates
were reduced and the Trade Unions were permitted to supplement levy payments from their own funds. On the 17th May, 1918, the Board of Trade passed the Cotton (Restriction of Output) Order, 1918, under which all spindles and looms worked required the licence of the Cotton Control Board, which was authorised to prescribe both the hours to be worked and the amount of machinery to be used, and also to make conditions as to payments for licences. Under this Order new regulations were issued, e ducing the week, in the case of very many mills, to forty hours, and permitting a fifty-five and a-half hours&apos; week only in exceptional cases. The previous regulation with regard to &quot;playing off&quot; by rotation was cancelled. Thus, operatives would only be paid from Control Board funds who were &quot;played off&quot; continuously through the regulations of the Control Board, and no operative so &quot;played off&quot; would receive out-of-work payment if he declined to &apos;undertake, when offered, other work which the local joint committee considered suitable.These orders were to come into force from the 10th June, but they gave rise to very serious criticism and opposition, and their operation was postponed for six weeks from that date. The effect of the orders on xbe numbers unemployed was not serious, but the reduction of hours, which affected some 80 per cent, of the mills, resulted in serious reduction in the operatives&apos; earnings, a reduction which went far to neutralise the effect of the 25 per cent, increase in wages which had been granted in the month of May.The principal reason which is believed to have actuated the Cotton Control Board in the abolition of the &quot; Rota &quot; system was the waste of man-power which that system involved. That waste was comparatively unimportant at the commencement, when, notwithstanding the shortage of cotton, many of the mills found it impossible to obtain the labour which they required. It became progressively serious as the supplies of cotton further decreased, and the maximum spindlage was reduced to 50 per cent. The provision empowering the Cotton Control Board to refuse payment in those cases in which the operatives &quot; played off&quot; would not accept work elsewherejwas in the nature of things extraordinarily difficult to enforce, and it was alleged that no attempt was made to obtain work elsewhere on the part of those temporarily unemployed. The objections to the abolition of the system have been urged on the ground that voluntary unemploy-ment was, in fact, rare, and that, behind the apparently innocent provision of the present regulation, there is a desire to release men for the army, and to introduce a modified form of industrial conscription, by compelling operatives to work in mills where they do not desire employment.The agitation was so intense that after receiving a deputation from the Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association Sir Arthur Stanley requested the Cotton Control Beard to pospone the abolition of the &quot; Rota&quot; until the 3rd August, a request which the Control Board accepted. He subsequently interviewed the Control Board, and, after the interview, an official statement was issued, stating that the Rota system would be definitely abolished on Saturday, the 10th August; that the scale of unemployment payments would be increased from the 12th August by 20 per cent, all round ; and that refusal to take other work in districts away from home would not disqualify unemployed operatives from receipt of Control Board payments. On Saturday, the -3rd August, a delegate meeting of textile workers was held in Manchester to consider the question, and decided to accept the recommendation of the Legislative Council of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association. That Association had recommended that the terms should be accepted. An amendment to submit the latest proposals to members in the districts for their acceptance or otherwise was proposed but was not carried. Following the meeting the spinners decided to take a ballot on the question whether they should enforce a continuance of the &quot;Rota&quot; system and payment for hours lost per week through restriction of working hours. This action of the spinners complicated the position in two ways. First, they broke away from the decision of the general delegate meeting on the question of the &quot;Rota,&quot; and, second, they introduced the question of payment for the fifteen and a-half hours time lost through short running of machinery. The ballot taken by the spinners obtained an 80 per cent, majority , against acceptance of the new conditions, and notices were tendered to expire on the 7th September. This action of the spinners is not supported generally in the cotton districts, and the &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; published a strong article on the 9th August sympathising with their grievance, but condemning their action.The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations addressed the Ministry of Labour on the subject, and the Executive Committee of the Operative Spinners&apos; Amalgamation was invited to attend for an interview. On the 29th August they visited Montagu House, and Sir David Shackleton drew their attention to No. 42
of the D.O.K. Regulations, and warned them- as to the serious effects which would result from any stoppage of work. The Executive Committee thereupon resolved to post-date the strike notices for a week, and to call a general meeting of the Spinners&apos; Amalgamation to consider the question. This is the present position, and it seems probable that, in view of the fact that they are not supported by the weavers or the card-room operatives, and that they now have a clear understanding that Regulation 42 prevents payment of strike pay, the spinners may retreat from the position which they have taken up. Should they maintain that position the Government will be faced with a very serious state of affairs in Lancashire.II. Pkess Comments.(A.) Military.The failure of the Allies to win successes equal to the greatest German victories is ascribed by the &quot; New Statesman&quot; to the fact that our High Command insufficiently realised beforehand the value of driving through to strategic objectives. Recent success is attributable primarily to the tactical superiority which we have gained by the employment of tanks. The delay in developing this superiority was chiefly due&apos; to the stupidity and prejudice of our &quot;military mandarins.&quot; No comment of special interest is reported from the Labour Press, except from the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; which by reference to press accounts of Turpinite, seeks to prove that the French had invented poison gas in 1914. It concludes that atrocities are a feature of warfare, and that to continue fighting in order to punish the other side for atrocities is hypocritical, wicked, and absurd.(B.) Foreign Politics.Russia.Nothing fresh emerges from the stream of comments on intervention in Russia, which is still condemned, as aiding reactionary Russia to overthrow the revolution (the &quot; Herald &quot;) or as committing the Allies to the monarchist party (&quot; Justice &quot;). In the &quot; Herald &quot; the editor of the &quot; Pravda&quot; attempts to magnify the constructive measures carried out by the Bolsheviks. A manifesto by the British Socialist Party, which appears in the &quot; Call,&quot; urges that the defeat cf the Russian Revolution means the defeat of Labour everywhere. Labour is also appealed to by the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; which ascribes the shortage of coal to the taking of 75,000 men from the mines for the expedition to Russia, or to replace men sent there.Pacifism.The &quot; Call&quot; refers to recent speeches of Allied statesmen upon peace terms, and discusses them as being full of hypocrisy and mendacity. It considers that Dr. Solfs speech opens the way to a negotiated peace but that the Allies will not take steps to meet him, and asks whether it is not time that the peoples took the matter into their own hands. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that there is a counter-offensive in progress against the peace proposals which may shortly be expected from Germany. It attacks recent declarations of policy as being incompatible with the chastened spirit necessary as a preliminary to adherence to a League of Nations, whose object is to maintain lasting peace. The writer expresses his disgust at reading Mr. Kellaway&apos;s speech at Hull, which followed Dr. Solfs &quot; speech of moderation &quot; reported on the 22nd August, and concludes &quot; so the abyss is made deeper by vicious and reckless talk.&quot;The Internationale.Press activity an favour of a new Internationale has diminished. The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer&quot; admits, though with- regret, that hopes of success have receded, if Dr. Troelstra has been correctly reported in &quot; L&apos;Humanite.&quot; Assuming that he has, &quot; Justice &quot; describes the International Socialist Bureau as incompetent, and holds the Internationale incapable of securing a democratic and durable peace by any metnod. It also publishes extracts from the letter of M.M. Vandervelde and de Brouckere to Mr. Henderson, saying that the action of the German Majority Socialists during the war leads to the same conclusion.
(C) Borne Politics.General Election. .The &quot; Herald &quot; continues to support an election as a means of getting rid oi a Government which it describes as unwieldy, untrustworthy, reactionary and corrupt, and incompetent to conclude any peace. An election might secure a Government which would take the view of a possible peace expressed by the &quot; Herald,&quot; viz,, &quot;the Internationale or disaster.&quot; The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; envisages an early General Election with little enthusiasm, but thinks that it will result in a larger body of independent members than the present Opposition in the House of Commons. It is essential that the Labour Party should have a definite policy on this subject, though it has none at present.Housing.The monthly circular of the Durham Miners&apos; Association presses for a large measure of reformation in the housing conditions of the industrial classes.(D.) -Labour.Mr. Gompers.In welcoming the visit of Mr. Gompers to this country, the Labour press is critical of his general policy. Thus the &quot; Herald&quot; alleges that British Labour is quite ready to listen to his advice, but will accept no sort of dictation from him or anyone else from the other side. As Mr. Gompers has never accepted the Internationale as the basis of the Labour movement, and is frankly anti-Socialist, he is entirely out of sympathy with the principles of national and international solidarity on which the Labour movement of Britain has been built up. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; welcomes Mr. Gompers, but warns him not to intermeddle with our domestic political affairs by fighting the pacifists and other elements which favour a speedy compromise peace.Trades Union Congress.The &quot;Herald&quot; prints a symposium calling for unity at the Jubilee Congress at Derby. Mr. Ogden characterises trade unionism as a religion, demanding brotherhood and real Christianity; the need to-day is for greater unity and trust in each other. Mr. Lansbury attacks Mr. Havelock. Wilson, whom he charges with being supported by the &quot;Yellow Jingo Press,&quot; owing to its fear of the solidarity of the workers. Mr. Henderson considers that paralysing divisions and disputes should immediately cease, before both the industrial and political sides of the labour movement reach the brink of a great disaster. In the &quot; British Citizen &quot; Mr. Victor Fisher pleads for leadership, concentration, and unification, with more sympathy for the cause of the workers, if the Congress is to do real good. The Labour Correspondent of the &quot;Christian Commonwealth&quot; regards the coming Trades Union Congress as in some ways the most important held during the war, and maintains that the most vital question is the formation of a Trades Union Party. Mr. Havelock Wilsons circular, backed by the Northcliffe Press can be signed by anyone and should count for nothing, whereas any delegate who votes at the conference is instructed how to vote by the organisation which sends him. Both the &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; and the &quot; Cotton Factory Times&quot; oppose Mr. Wilson&apos;s scheme. The &quot; Clarion,&quot;.however, thinks the revolt a useful stimulus.Women s Wages.The question of equal pay for equal work is much discussed. The &quot; New Witness&quot; is elated by the successful combination of women clerks. Mr. Brailsford, in the &quot;Herald,&quot; insists on the difficulty which the acceptance of the claim will cause to women who require employment after the war, though this argument is contradicted by the &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; which points to their success in cotton weaving. Mr. Brailsford&apos;s remedy is State grants for wives and children, modelled on the military separation allowances The &quot; Herald,&quot; in &quot; Trade Union and Labour Notes,&quot; demands that the problem should be tackled nationally and at once.1The Embargo.Mr. J. T. Murphy has a cijaracteristic article on the embargo in the &quot; Workeis, Dreadnought.&quot; The monopoly value of the skilled men has gone never to return. Trade Unionism belongs to an era of the past, and attention should be turned to forming
the workers&apos; committee&apos;, and so aim at the workers&apos; republic. Mr. Dawtrey, secretary of the Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society, in his monthly report hints at sinister pacifist influences behind the curtain in the embargo strike.The Government and Labour.- In its &quot; Trade Union and Labour notes&quot; the &quot;Herald&quot; attacks the Ministry of Munitions on the ground of lack of understanding in its dealings with labour, and alleges that 90 per cent, of the troubles since the first Clyde strike have been due to the blunderings or insolence of civil servants.Food.&quot; Justice&quot; argues that the certainty that the rise in the price of meat will cause internecine industrial difficulties justified the demand for a State subvention in order to maintain prices at their present level.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Several minor disturbances, chiefly connected with demands for higher wages, have occurred both in munition works and in other trades. The strike among the transport workers practically ended on the 28th August, and that of ladies&apos; tailors on the 27th.The Amalgamated Union of Upholsterers issued a circular to the employers concerned, demanding a rise in wages for both male and female employees, based on advances conceded in the trade outside London. A strike was threatened on the 23rd August, but from the latest information it seems that the question has been settled, and there is no fear of a stoppage.The women at Cubitts are carrying on a strong agitation for increased wages, and are making efforts to induce all their fellow workers to join the Union. The men in the tool room at Messrs. Berwick&apos;s (Park Royal) have demanded a general increase in. wages. This question will he referred to the Ministry of Munitions, and the firm has promised to press for an early settlement.A meeting held by Mr, Ramsay MacDonald, under the auspices of the Independent Labour Party, at Plumstead, on the 31st August, was broken up, amid scenes of violence, by a hostile crowd, spurred on by Stubbs and members of the Royal Arsenal Branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers. Some friction has been caused in the Gun Inspection Department at the Royal Gun Factory, Woolwich, owing to the dismissal of a man named Rossiter for refusing to explain the work to the new military officer in charge of the department. Stubbs, who was a member of a Committee to put the matter before the management, has been dismissed for using insulting language and for insubordination.West Midlands.The situation in this district remains undisturbed at present, and the most serious complaints relate to the shortage of beer and tobacco.Trouble may arise in Coventry from the fact that Dingley&apos;s applications for work there have been refused.Efforts are being made to organise the coal porters in Coventry in the event of a national strike. The signalmen of the United Kingdom, at their their conference in Birmingham, passed a resolution condemning the employment of women in signal boxes.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The unrest among the co-operative societies&apos; employees&apos; causes considerable anxiety. Otherwise the district seems fairly quiet.In Nottingham, the Corporation employees have applied for increased wages, but are willing to continue work if the case is dealt with expeditiously.North-Western,The situation in this district is more serious than last week. Unrest has spread among co-operative employees and munition workers, and has affected railwaymen also.[1100-451 &amp;
6At Liverpool at. a meeting of the Mersey District Shop Stewards on the 1st September, with John Finnigan, president of the Reconstruction Committee in the chair, the draft scheme for the new organisation was approved. This is to be culled the General Council of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, Mersey District, and the intention is that it shall supersede the Mersey Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, taking over the functions ordinarily undertaken by Trade Unions. It is to control workshop committees, though these, at the same time, are to have greater freedom of action within their particular shops. Copies of the draft are being widely circulated throughout Great Britain. A Liter meeting of shop stewards again discussed the question of the distinction between new and repair work. They contend that the matter is not one for arbitration, as agreements already exist. This question may lead to serious disturbance in a week or two if no agreement is arrived at.On the 29th August a mass meeting of rail way men was held in Liverpool, demand-ing a ten shilling increase in wages, and equal pay for men and women. They do not want to use the threat of a strike if their petition has any chance of being granted without it.About thirty electricians at the Lilac Mill, Manchester, are &quot; going slow,&quot; because the Ministry of Munitions has made no reply to their claim for wages lost during a stay-in strike last June.South Wales.It is now suggested that the reports of unrest among the miners in this area owing to food shortage are considerably exaggerated.Scotland.The situation in this district remains fairly satisfactory. In Glasgow the majority of miners are said to favour a strike over their demand for an increase of wages, and the railwaymen are asking for more money. Neither party has leaders at present. Throughout the district women are talking of their right to equal pay.Ireland.At Belfast on the 21st August, at a large meeting of workers engaged in the ship-building and engineering industries, a resolution was passed in favour of shorter hours with no reduction of pay.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of W^ork.Less disturbance is manifest in the general situation this week, while the disputes at present in progress are of minor importance.The Admiralty Labour Department has only five new strikes to report.These include a strike of riveters at Messrs. Barclay Curie and A. Stephen and Sons against an award of the Committee on Production. The men claimed a 20-per-cent. advance, but the finding in the present case is, that the parties should try to agree upon piece prices, or, where this is impossible, that they should work at piece-work speed at certain rates mentiuned in the award.Some electricians at the Humber Graving Dock ceased work on the 26th owing to the refusal of the firm to discharge two men whom the E.T.U. alleged to be inefficient. It was ultimately decided to resume work on the 28th, but to give notice of further cessation of work unless the men in question were transferred.Work has been resumed at Messrs. J. J. ThorneycrofVs and the Ministry of Labour is endeavouring to set up a Court of Demarcation to deal with the case.The strike of riveters at Messrs. Ramage and Ferguson is now over. The cause of the dispute was the employment of unskilled labour on cutting out with oxy-acetylene burning plant.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 5,031 people involved in strikes for the week ending the 28th August, but the number out at the close was only 602, compared with 2,580 on the 21st August. 1A strike occurred at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s Glasgow, owing to the transfer of a number of engineers from work on a bonus system to experimental work at time rates. They threatened to bring out the whole of the howitzer shop in sympathy.   At a conference
of the shop stewards and management, however, it was decided that the firm should not compel any employee to accept experimental work at time rates while sufficient bonus work was available; the men, on their part, are to exert no compulsion to prevent any man who is willing&apos; from undertaking such work.The brassworkers at Messrs. Douglas Brothers, Bristol, ceased work, while remaining at their benches, in order to enforce recognition of their trade union officials and shop stewards, and had ultimately to be ejected by the police. Before tho war this was a non-union shop, and though since 1914 unionists have worked in it, there has been no recognition of any union.&quot;Workers at the Siddeley Deasy Motor Company refused to work overtime, on the ground of inadequate feeding, and eventually ceased work altogether, alleging that the firm had refused to receive the shop stewards. , A settlement has now been effected, however.The Coal Controller has five new strikes to report, involving in all 5,900 men.The only strike of any importance is one at the Llanhilleth Colliery, where a complaint was made against certain officials on a matter of safety. A temporary resumption of work has been secured pending negotiations.The War Office Contracts Department reports three new stoppages.These include a short strike of workers employed on clothing at Liverpool owing to the non-payment of an award of the Committee on Production; also one of the workers upon the manufacture of tents in the London area, who demanded a flat rate advance of 6s. a week.   In the latter case the men do not belong to any union.Reported from other Sources,The strike of Co-operative employees is still unsettled, and a number of other works have come out in sympathy with the original strikers at Longsight.The directors of the Co-operative Wholesale Society still desire that their employees should form craft unions, and there is at present little prospect of an amicable settlement. The Ministry of Labour has been approached by the directors of the C.W.S., and it has been decided to proclaim the dispute under the Munitions of War Act, a course which has already been taken in the case of the strike of employees of retail co-operative societies in Yorkshire.The strike of building trade operatives at Dublin has been settled, the men accepting l\d. per hour, as against an initial demand of 3 d Some workers had previously resumed owing to the concessions made by the employers.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department notes considerable dissatisfaction in Barrow with the recent award of 3s. 6d. granted by the Committee on Production. A mass meeting was to be held on the 1st September, and in the meantime all overtime has been stopped.At Messrs. Yarrow &amp; Co., Glasgow, the joiners have been ordered by their society to leave the firm owing to the existence of a system of payment by results. This has hitherto apparently worked satisfactorily and has been favoured by the men. A prosecution of the executive of the trade union under D.O.R.A. is now under consideration.The shipwrights and joiners employed by boat-building firms on the Thames outside the London area have ceased working overtime, to press their demand for London rates and conditions.Few disputes of importance are noted by the Ministry of Munitions.The men employed at the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, Bristol, have threatened to strike unless conceded an advance of 20 per cent, and a reduction of hours.Aircraft workers at High Wycombe are objecting to the employment of men who do not belong to recognised trade unions, and a resolution to strike has been passed unless these men join a recognised union. The agitation seems to be directed against the Building Workers&apos; Industrial Union, which is not recognised by the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives. The firm are now dismissing men who will not transfer their membership to recognised unions.The Coal Controller has two new controversial cases to report. 1The Enginemen&apos;s Society of Somersetshire has claimed increased wages and reduced hours. The owners offered certain concessions, but these were refused and it has now been agreed that the matter should be referred to arbitration.
8Considerable unrest is resulting among&apos; the surface workers owing to the delay of the Miners&apos; Federation in giving any final reply as to the payment of war wage for substiluted shifts and overtime. The Controller is again exerting pressure upon this point.The War Office Contracts Department has six new controversial cases to report.The most important of these is in connection with the clothing trade, in which much discontent is expressed with the recent award of the Committee on Production granting an advance of 6s. a week. The men had previously put forward a demand for 18s. a week. At one firm two days&apos; notice of a strike was given on the 31st August, without reference to the United Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union; this was, however, modified and a week&apos;s notice given instead. The London branch of the Union, again, have given orders for a decrease in the work done by cutters, and have informed various London firms of this decision. It is now hoped that a stoppage Avhich might involve serious consequences, will be averted.Reported from other Sources.The employees of the co-operative distributive societies in Yorkshire have given notice to cease work from the 7th September, on a question mainly of wages. The dispute, which might have had disastrous results in dislocation of food supplies, has been proclaimed under the Munitions of War Act, 1915, and will be referred to arbitration.The Committee on Production has heard thirty-eight cases in London and seven at Newcastle during the past week. The principal of these concern the women tramway and omnibus workers, an application by men in the building trade, and another by vehicle makers for increased wages and the 12^ per cent, bonus.The number of differences reported to the Chief Industrial Commissioner is 188, of which nineteen are claims for the 12^- per cent, bonus. By far the largest number fall within the engineering, shipbuilding, and metal trades group.D. J. SHACKLETON.(For the Minister, who is absent from London).o
