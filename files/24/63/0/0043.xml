4$5 D0CUL3NT IS THE FKOPIftTY OF HIS BRITAlKvIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEMEMT^\7 A R   C.ABI N E T.FORD   VANS   FOR   MESOPOTAMIA. Note by the Secretary. (See also G.T.564&apos;1, War Cabinet 455/6, and 465/2)With reference to War Cabinet 466, Minute 2, of 30.8.18, relating to the supply of Ford Vans for Mesopotamia, the Quartermaster General informs me that he has been in oommuni-cation with the Food production Department, and gathers, though accurate figures are not available, that they have about 500 Ford Vans.        The Quartermaster General adds that there are other Ford vehicles on the road which might be requisitioned, but neither in the case of the vans belonging to the Food production Department nor in the case of privately owned ones, would they be of any real value to be sent to Mesopotamia. They would all require thoroughly overhauling, and there would also be the difficulty of the provision of spare parts.      The Quartermaster,General states that on the whole, after discussing the matter with Lord Milner, he thinks the only sound plan is to press America to get on with the 1300 Ford Vans,     This the Quartermaster General is doing.(Sd.)   T. JOKES,for Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens-,. S.W., September 9th, 1918.10 RET.1,-5645. rM.
