-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government]&apos;Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1918.12MUNITIONS POLICY.1919 or 1920.1. THE extremely important paper written by the Chief of the Staff on the 25th July affirms the conviction that the German armies in the West could be decisively defeated in the summer of 1919, provided that we selected a climax, concentrated every available resource upon it, and subordinated intervening events to it. The method of mechanical attack was also set out by the General Staff, and our preparations to produce the necessary vehicles are at hand. The brilliant successes which have been gained, almost without intermission, since General Wilson&apos;s paper was written, reveal the justice of the above conception, with which, I may mention, General Retain seems to be in the most complete accord. No doubt it is right to exploit to the full the present favourable situation, and we need not exclude the possibility of results being achieved of a very far-reaching character. On the assumption, however, that these results are not decisive, and that the winter closes down with an unbroken German front in the West, we ought now to have reached definite conclusions as to the character of next year&apos;s campaign. The questions involved affect directly every arrangement for munitions supply and man-power. All these questions can be settled harmonious]y if they are related to some central design, if for the first time we have a definite war policy towards which every part of our organisation contributes.The first question, therefore, to be answered is: Are we. to try for a decisive victory in the West next year as the Chief of the Staff advises, or alternatively are we to make our arrangements on the basis of carrying on as well as possible without running too great risks during 19.19, and reserving the climax of the war till 1920&apos;? It is obvious that on this decision depends the treat-ment of almost every question, national and inter-Allied, pending at the present time. For instance, if we do not hope for victory next year, and resign ourselves to 1920, there is clearly no need to worry about a hasty development of the American armies in advance of their own domestic munitions supply. We ought to-refuse to make any large commitments in the way of artillery or equipment. We ought to ease up the strain on our own population, civil industries, shipping, &amp;c , so that in its modified form it may be borne as long as possible. We ought to press on with large works of construction and war projects which require 12 to 18 months for their execution. We ought to press continually and to the utmost the development of our mercantile marine. The objections which may be urged against the further increase of our immense naval superiority over the enemy would lose much of their force; and, lastly, our army should be promptly cut down to the limit of divisions which could be kept in the field to the end of 1920. Our munitions programmes could be fitted in with such arrangements, so as to pile up large reserves of all kinds in .1919, which could be used in 1920. This might enable further releases of munition workers to take place in the early months ol 1920, while yet insuring adequate supplies for the reduced army.Agreeably with the above, an increasing proportion of our war effort would be devoted to the East, to ensuring the defence of India, to endeavouring to rebuild the Russian fighting front, and to prosecuting our attacks upon the Turkish Empire. We should be content to play a very subordinate role in France, and generally in the Allied Councils, during 1919, and count on having solid forces and conserved resources available for the decisive struggles of 1920, or held in hand for the peace situation if our Allies break down meanwhile.Now this, at any rate, whatever else may be said about it, is a clear policy, and it cannot be denied that, taking a particularist view of British interests, there are many features in it to which weight may be assigned.   But if it is to be adopted it should be[768]
scientifically organised and. deliberately pursued. This should be the definite theme in accordance with which our policy in every sphere of national activity should be shaped and developed. Having adopted, it, we should not be drawn from it by flickers of success, or by the entreaties of our Allies. Home politics, foreign politics, trade, food, munitions, man-power, shipbuilding, Army, Navy, Air Service-all should be governed by these general conceptions. It is better to have a policy of this kind than simply to drift, the sport of circumstances and accident, and a facile tool of other Powers with a will and a plan of their own.2. The alternative policy of aiming at victory next year would also carry with it a whole series of consequential decisions, which it is urged should be regarded as a designed whole, and not a mere accommodation of departmental aspirations.This second alternative would appear to require, inter alia, the following measures : (a.) The bringing over of the largest possible number of American troops.(b.) In order to encourage the above, we must do our very utmost to arm, equip, and clothe them in advance of their own war industries.(c.) All works of construction which cannot yield a war result during the period of climax in 19.19 should be rigorously pruned.[d.) Every effort should be made during the winter to accumulate munitions, and further releases from the munitions works should be stopped during that period; but in the early spring of 1919 large releases should again begin from the munitions works, and for this purpose our reserves of ammunition, filled and unfilled, should be decidedly drawn upon.(e.) From March onwards every effort should be concentrated in the shipyards on vessels nearing completion, and there should be a definite diminution in the starting of new work or of long-dated work. A substantial contribu-tion of men from Admiralty industries of all kinds should be made in time , for them to reach the field trained during the battle period.(/.) The release of coal-miners from the mines should be renewed in the early spring, agreeably to the diminution in the output of munitions, and we should be prepared to run considerable risks in the winter of 1919 in coal supply in the effort of making victory certain.(g.) It should be possible for the Navy to assist during the period of the decisive battle by releasing temporarily sailors and marines to strengthen the Army. There could be no better form for a naval contribution than to supply the men necessary to steer and manage, say, the last 2,000 British tanks to be completed before the battle.(h.) The Air Force should conform in its development to the policy of a climax, i.e., all establishments in this country should be cut down to the minimum during the decisive period. The Aerial Home Defence in all its forms should be temporarily cut down. The long periods of training and preparation which intervene between the handing over of machines and the formation of squadrons should in regard to the last batch of squadrons that can be completed in time be deliberately curtailed.(i,) The people of the country as a whole should be taught to look for a climax and work for it. They would then be found to be ready to make very great sacrifices to secure victory, even if this involved a far harder state of life than anything we have yet experienced.3. Although I have contrasted these two alternative courses for the purpose of showing how important it is to make a choice, it is obvious that a very large proportion of our action will be common to both courses. If we try our best to preserve as much strength as possible for 1920, it will weaken our war effort in 1919, but nevertheless that war effort will be a great one. Conversely, if we make every exertion to procure a climax in 1919, and then fail, we shall still have the means of continuing asa powerful factor in 1920. The question is not one of an absolute choice, but of emphasis. It seems to me that the War Cabinet ought to give an early and unmistakable decision on which side the emphasis is to be thrown.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.September 5, 1918.o
