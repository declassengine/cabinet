(THIS DOCUT-fBNT IS THE P^OPSftTY OF HIS BTETAOTTIC KAJliSTY&apos; S GOTOKMEHT)of Home1 Affair8 25 C RET.Statement by the Ministry of Health Committee of the Royal College cf Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England..............Tho Ministry of Health Committee of the Royal College cf Physicians of London anc tho loyal College of Surgeons of England have considered tho draft Bill for &quot;establishing a Ministry of Health and Local Government and a Board of Health and Local Govern-mont in England and Wales and in Scotland, respectively&quot; together with a draft Order in Council relating thereto *v/ith regard to the draft Bill, tho Committee are strongly of opinion that the title of the proposed Ministry is open to objec-tion, because it doe3 not dissociate with sufficient distinctness, Health questions from Local Government questions, and does not sufficiently emphasise the functions of a Minister of Health.The question of Title is thus much more than a verbal one and in the opinion of the Committee the usefulness of the Department might be diminished, by any more complicated or less distinct Title than that of &quot;Ministry of Health,&quot;On the clauses of the Bill itself, the Committee have&apos; no recommendations to offer.&quot;&apos;ith rtspect, hovever, to the Order in Council, the Committee are unanimously of the opinion that certain alterations should be made,These alterations are embodied in the following resolutions adopted by the. Committee.(1) (a). There shall be a Medical Consultative Council set up by the Statute as part of the permanent organisation of tho Ministry.(b) Sucv: Council shall meet frequently, have the right of access to the Minister and the power to initiate advice.(c) The members of the Medical Consultative Council shall be equally representative   of the curative and pre-. Tentative sides of the profession.(d) Such Council shall have the power to co-opt not more than two members,^ith regard to (l) (a).   If it is to be understood that the words in Section 4 of the Bill &quot;It shall be lawful for Hie Majesty by Order in Council to establish Consultative Councils&quot; means that the Consultative Councils shall be established, and that one of such Councils nil be a Consultative Council of registered Medical Practitioners, resolution (r). (a) of the Committee iVi met,Resolution (l) (b) of the Committee must be strongly emphasised. The Committee consider, it to be absolutely essential that the Medical Consultative Council should have, through their Chairman, right of access to the Minister, and the right to initiate advice on medical questions althou h these have not been referred to them by the Minister.V/AR CABIEET.G,T. 5631.
In order U carry out this resolution the Committee consider it vital to insert in the Order in Council a provision to the effect that the Chairman of a Oouncil, on behalf of the Council as ft whole, shall have direct aooess to the Minister and furthty that a new aub-paragraph should be added after $ufo-paragraph (2) of clause 12 of the draft Order in Council, to the following eftfm(3) It shall further be open to a Council to present Ho the Minister from time to time a report on any matters &quot;affecting or incidental to the health of the people which have not been made a subject of reference to them under ty foregoing provisions of this Order, and the Minister shall receive and consider any such report/&apos;if this additional sub-paragraph be added, the Committee v&amp;in no objection to sub-paragraph (2) of clause 12 remaining as it ij drafted*the Committee attach great importance to the resolution (I) (( as well as to the proposed mode of selection of the members ofConsultative Council,    this U dealt with later on.Resolution (1) (d) is proposed to provide against accidentalomission of persons specially suitable for appointment on &amp; Councils,with regard to the periods of meetings of the Council clangs (8) sub-paragraph (1) of the order in Council provides that a Council shall meet at such times as the Council may with the approval of the Minister determine provided that the Council meet at least ome in each quarter.The Committee understand by this provision, that the Minister would have the power .to prevent the Council from meeting more frequently than once in each quarter, by withbdW&amp;ag his approval! to more frequent meetings, and in the opinion of the Committee this provision might be destructive to the efficient working of Council *the Committee are aware that clause 12 sutHparagrapn 3 provid that waubjeet to the provisions contained in this Order a Coumi may regulate their own procedure&quot; but the regulation of their m procedure in regard to the number of meetings would appear to fee govermd by clause 0 sub^paragraph (1) namely, that they cannot mm% morej than once a quarter without the approval of the Ministr he Committee submit that this provision should be modified, sso that a Council may have sufficient opportunities of diseu$$inj subjects germane to it.With regard to the selection of the persons who should fosw tf Consultative Council dealing with medical questions, and in e*dw to assist the Minister in Ms desire to find the best eombinatiof of advisors? the Committee discussed with dr* Addison means.,by % representative bodies within the Medical Profession might be ask suggest suitable names of persons representing varieties of knot and experience as distinct from representatives of organisations districts from whieh the Council should be selected by the MinisThe Committee recognise that it may not be desirable to laswl in the Order in Counail m$ precise method of appeintme&amp;t to the Councils1 although they have jreparad a scheme for this purpose f are willing to supply the iist or representative Bodies, within profeseion referred to*1The Committee desire to express their appreciation of the eoiil utton shown by the goto!ttee for Home ktt&amp;irn in allowing them tl opportunity of expressing their views on these matters * They wii &amp;dd that&quot;-they will be happy to give further information by laterfor in writing.september ^tk &apos;&quot;
