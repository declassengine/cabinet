SOME ten years ago the Italian Professor Brighenti, when publishing his series of admirable dictionaries and grammars of the modern Greek language, could find no more suitahle or natural dedication for his works than &quot;Alia Grecia Irredenta.&quot; Strange as that dedication would have appeared to almost any Italian or Greek during the last six years, it represented the almost universal feeling of both peoples up till 1912, as it may once again, there are signs to show, represent the best feeling of both nations. Italians and Greeks have in common the consciousness, on which their writers continuously, perhaps too insistently, dwell, that they are the descendants and representatives of the Greco-Roman tradition on which European civilisation ultimately rests. More than that, in modern times, once the rivalries of the two Churches and competing commercial interests had been swamped by common misfortunes at the hands of alien races, the nineteenth century saw both peoples entering on a new course which led in both cases to national emancipation and independence. The result of the War of Greek Independence, in which Italian volunteers took part, was welcomed as cordially by Italian opinion as the making of Italian unity, which followed thirty years later, was welcomed by the Greek people. Both Mediterranean nations Greece, of coarse, to a greater extent than Italy knew themselves dependent finally on the Powers which held the seas, to which fortunately both peoples were bound by ties of sympathy and gratitude. There was further no active cause for dissension1 between Greece and Italy beyond such healthy commercial rivalry as exists between most neighbouring nations. Once the Ionian Islands with their tradition of Venetian culture had finally passed by the gift of Britain under the Greek Crown, no possible territorial question seemed likely to arise between the two nations. There was always, however, once Italian policy became even in part identified with that of her Germanic Allies, a suspicion lest Italy might improve her position as regards Austria by an aggressive policy in the Balkans over the Albanian question. But it was not from that side that the first cloud arose.2. It arose in fact in a purely incidental fashion. When in September 1911 Italy had engaged herself in war with the Turkish Empire, compelled to restrict her activities to non-European Turkey she finally proceeded between the 22nd April and 22nd May, 1912, to occupy in turn Rhodes and the small neighbouring islands, together known as the Dodekanese.* The coming of the Italians was hailed with joy by the Greek inhabitants who numbered about 133,761 out of a total population of 143,080. The army of occupation was acclaimed as a liberator, and no doubt at the moment seems to have arisen that the occupation was a temporary one, a necessary act of war, and that the Italian Government would certainly execute its good intentions, t   Italy in fact* There are far more than twelve islands, but the twelve generally named are: Rhodes, Kasos, Simi (Sumbegi), Tilos (or Episkopi), Kos (or Stanco), Karpathos (or Scarpanto), Nisiros, Khalki formerly comprising the sanjak of Rhodes; and Leros, Patmos, Kalimnos and Stambalia (Astipalea) included in the sanjak of Khios.t For which see p. 3.14[367-39]B
2assured the Powers that she held the Dodekanese as a pledge against Turkey, and that, as soon as all the Turkish forces were withdrawn from Tripoli and Turkey had carried out the engagements she had entered into by the Treaty of Lausanne, she would no longer retain these islands. The Greek Kingdom, indeed, possessed no actual title to the Dodekanese, but to the average Greek the territory was as much national territory as any within the Greek frontiers. Eight through history down till the end of the Middle Ages these islands had been Greek. Moreover, the population, as we have seen, is practically purely Greek, with the exception of a sprinkling of Turks (L2  per cent.) in Rhodes and Kos, and a small cosmopolitan population (6 per cent.) in Rhodes. As against such a claim,, the only case that could be put forward by other Powers-Turkey or Italy was the right of conquest. There was in Italy&apos;s case the further somewhat fahtastic^oint .tmdrfrom 1309 to 1524 Rhodes and the neighbouring islands had belonged to the Knights of St. John, and that Italy was their legitimate heir.3. Before the Italo-Turkish war had finished, the Balkan war broke out. The Greek fleet, which held the iEgean, was restricted to the occupation of the Northern Turkish Islands, since the Italian authorities were already in occupation of the Dodekanese. This was felt as a distinct grievance in Greece, but as a grievance which was only likely to be a temporary one. Greco-Italian relations, however, received a severer shock from the emergence of the Albanian question in the course of the discussions between the Powers which followed on the rearrangement of the Balkan map. The Conference of Ambassadors in London, presided over by Sir Edward Grey, decided (11th August, 1913) on the constitution of an independent Albanian State, and, after a heated discussion and in spite of vigorous Greek protests, there was included within that State Southern Albania, or Northern Epirus as the Greeks call it, the frontier between Greece and the new State running from Lake Presba down to Cape Stilos. The work of frontier delimitation, entrusted to an International Corn-mission, was concluded in December 1913. The new Kingdom of Prince William of Wied (who arrived in Durazzo on the 7th March, 1914), however, was unable to establish any real authority over this southern province. The inhabitants of it are admittedly Albanian by race (Tosks), but by religion they are Greek Orthodox, and their cultural history up till quite recent times was entirely connected) with that of Greece, within the borders of which so many thousands of their race lived perfectly contentedly and, in many cases, quite absorbed in the Greek population. In towns like Aryirokastron (Ergeri) the purely Greek element was to be found, but, on the whole, the question at issue was whether race or culture was to be the criterion of the character of Northern Epirus. Unfortunately, no satisfactory appeal to the wishes of the inhabitants was attempted, or perhaps was possible. Greek bands organised them-selves in Northern Epirus-in part the spontaneous work of local Phil-Hellenes, in part, it was alleged, at the instigation of the Greek authorities. A Provisional Government was formed there under M. Zoghraphos, who afterwards held the post of Foreign Minister in the Ghounaris Government. Greek regular troops, which had penetrated into the province in the course of the Balkan wars, were formally withdrawn by the Venizelist Government in deference to the wishes of the Powers, but Albanian controversialists asserted that in practice they were still to be found there. The com-plete breakdown of Prince William&apos;s administration increased the disorder in Northern  pirus, and the outbreak of the European war made any attempt at effective inter-i vention by the Powers out of the question. On the 3rd September, 1914, the &quot; Mbret&quot; abandoned his kingdom. In October 1914 an Italian garrison occupied the island of Saseno, which had hitherto been regarded by the Greeks as forming part of the Ionian Islands ceded by the British Government in 1863. Following on that, Yalona (Avion) was occupied by a small Italian detachment. Not to be outdone, M. Venizelos at once proceeded to send Greek troops into Northern Epirus and occupied the whole district, declaring in justification that he had done so with the &quot;concurrence&quot; of the Entente Powers.and with the consent, obtained through them, of Italy. * He admitted that his action was purely a provisional one, and that the question must finally be definitely regulated by the Peace Conference. As an earnest of his good intentions, he refused to allow the administrative incorporation of Northern Epirus in the Kingdom of Greece, and did not admit representatives of the province to the deliberations of the Greek Chamber. i4. Unfortunately, during the following year the increasing bitterness between Greece and Italy was much accentuated by the course of events.   Greece failed toSee further pp. 4, 5.
3adopt the policy of M. Venizelos and to throw in her lot, as Italy did, with the Entente Powers. Consciousness of this on both sides intensified the mutual animosities. The Italian scornfully represented Greece as shirking her part in the struggle; the Greek returned this contemptuous language with a studied depreciation of Italian ideals and of Italy&apos;s effective part in the war. The Ghounaris Government and its press organs adopted continuously an offensive and provocative attitude towards Italy which increased the Helienophobe feeling of Italians. Little as the Venizelists approved or encouraged such language, they could not but be sensible that Italy&apos;s couduct towards the Greeks of the Dodekanese was, perhaps, partly in consequence of this estrangement, becoming more aud more unjustifiably severe. Instead of liberation, the Dodekanesiots found themselves reduced to a worse regime of oppression than even in recent Turkish times.&apos;5&apos; Those who emigrated were not allowed to return if they stayed away three months. Little was done by the Italian authorities under General Ameglio to alleviate the economic distress of the inhabitants, though every attention was paid to the small Turkish and Jewish population. The Italian authorities introduced Italian as the official language and the Italian postage everywhere, set aside local Greek administration and the local customs&apos;!&quot;, and announced Italy&apos;s intention of permanently annexing the islands. Further, word soon got about, though the fact was not clearly published till January 1918, that the Western Powers had in the Treaty of London (Article 8; agreed to Italy&apos;s &quot; full possession of all the islands of the Dodekanese at present occupied by her.&quot;Once embarked, by design or accident, on an Imperialist policy against Greece, the Italian Government and Italian opinion deliberately set themselves to hamper the activities of the Venizelist National Movement and, by keeping Greece out of the war, to encourage her in a policy which could only lead to her being completely discredited with the Western Allies and deprived of any hope of achieving her national aspirations. From the Italian Imperialist point of view King Constantino with his insane policy of alienating Greece&apos;s natural friends was fir less dangerous to Italy than M. Venizelos who, by bringing about Greek intervention on the side of the Allies, might have justiSeel an acceptance by them of his &quot;great idea,&quot; the union of Hellenism, which had become repugnant to Baron -Sonnino and to a large section of the Italian press and public. The exponent of this frankly anti-Greek and, in form, pro-Constantinian policy was Count Bosdari, the Italian Minister at Athens, whose stay there did more to embitter Greco-Italian relations than the action of almost any man. The anti-Venizelist Governments on their part must be held responsible for much legitimate Italian exasperation.   M. Venizelos&apos;s pledge that the Greek occupation of Northern* From the 16th century on the Sultans had allowed the islands a full measure of local autonomy in return for a payment of tribute: as well as the use of the Greek language and exemption from military conscription. The Young Turk Government in July 1909 attempted to abolish these privileges and to introduce the Turkish language, conscription, and sweeping taxation. In consequence of the lively protests of the islanders, these ordinances were revoked in November 1910 and the status quo restored. A special Commission was to examine the question, but nothing had been done when the Turco-Italian war broke out. The arrival and proclamations of the Italians excited the lively hopes of the inhabitants, though on the 7th June, 1912, they admitted in their memorial to the Powers that &quot; the privileges of the islands were so wide, so extensive, that, save for the nominal sovereignty of the Sultan, autonomy was complete&quot; (A. Reinach, &quot; L/Autonomie des Sles grecques.&quot;) The proclamation of Rear-Admiral Presbitero on the 12th May had promised them not only respect for their privileges aud institutions, but freedom from tribute. On the 17th June a congress of the islands at Patmos expressed &quot; its gratitude to the sister nation of Italy for deliverance from the insupportable Turkish yoke,&quot; proclaimed an independent &quot;iEgean State&quot; and &quot;the national, age-long desire of the iEgeans for union with their motherland Greece.&quot; Failing this, they asked for independence under the protection of the Powers. General Ameglio dissolved the congress and issued a warning against such a policy.   From thenceforward relations became bad.t An account of Italian &quot;oppression&quot; is given by a correspondent of the Athenian weekly &quot; Politiki Epitheorisis &quot; (26th March-8th April, 1916). Obviously this is a biassed source, but many of the statements are confirmed by impartial witnesses. The suppression of sponge-fishing, the staple industry of Kalimnos and Simi, is a burning grievance. After the occupation of Tripoli the Italian authorities established a monopoly of sponge-fishing off the African coast which told against the Dodekanesiots. In the spring of 1916 the Italians took the extreme step of summarily suppressing all;sponge-fishing in the Dodekanese, thereby inflicting heavy financial loss on the inhabitants. The reason given the growth of espionage is probably a perfectly good one. But the precaution taken was considered excessive. During 1916-17 the situation of the islanders went from bad to worse. The authorities failed to provide adequate food for the inhabitants  refugees last month report that the flour and bread ration is as low as 200 drams weekly in Kalimnos  and the result has been emigration on an increasing scale. According to an agent&apos;s report, 5.500 women and children have left Kalimnos recently for Crete and neighbouring islands. During 1915-16-17 the Italians prohibited Venezelist newspapers. Lately they have suspended the old constitution of Kalimnos and appointed a directorate of three persons. The Dodekanesiots have petitioned the Greek Government for assistance and formed a Committee in Athens to plead their cause. For diplomatic reasons M. Venizelos has not allowed public demonstrations in Athens on this subject. It is hard to say how far the Italian authorities&apos; repressive policy was justified by military necessity and &quot; exceptional circumstances.&quot;
4Epirus was only provisional and that the question was to be definitely settled by the Peace Conference was broken bv the Skouloudhis Government which allowed sixteen deputies from the province to take their seats in the Greek Chamber on the 4th February, 1917, following this up in March by the introduction of gradual administrative and economic union of Northern Epirus with the rest of Greece. It is true that M. Skontondhis declared, in response to the protest of the Powers, that &quot; this action was in no way in conflict with Greece&apos;s declaration of 1914, at the time of the reoccupation, when she recognised, that the question of Northern Epirus would be definitely settled in the final peace treaty,&quot; but there was a legitimate feeling of annoyance in Italy at such an action, which might well be considered to signify an agreement with tho Central Powers, who had almost pushed Greece into the annexation of this country in the hope that that would accentuate Greco-Italian differences and deflect Greek attention frem her Balkan quarrel.5, The provocative attitude adopted by both Governments had the natural conse-quence of still further inflaming the feeling of the two peoples. Insulting references were made to Italy in the Greek Chamber, for which the Skouloudhis Government was compelled to apologise. On the other hand, the Italian press, with the exception of a few more enlightened Radical organs, indulged in persistent recriminations against Greece and contemptuous references to the Venizelists. It says much for M. Venizelos that he did not allow either these slanders, or the more or less undisguised support that the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Italian Minister at Athens were lending to King Constantine, to alter his restrained and friendly attitude towards Italy. Himself always in favour of a Greco-Italian understanding, he did not allow his faith to be shaken by the unsympathetic attitude of the Italian Government. It is characteristic of the anti-Venizelist party politicians and press that, though they have been most insulting in their references to Italy during the past two years, they became during 1916 most friendly in their attitude towards her in consequence of the support that the Italian Foreign Office accorded to King Constantine. In September Venizelos left Athens for Saloniki to put himself at the head of the Provisional Government there established. From now on he was able once again to outline his ideas of foreign policy, and on the 1st December, the day of the battle of Athens, he gave a long interview to the &quot; Secolo,&quot; of Milan, which had distinguished itself from most of the Italian newspapers by its sensible attitude not oniy to Jugoslav, but to Greek aspirations. The Italian censorship did not allow this interview to be published till the 28th June of the following year, although, perhaps because, the tenor of it was wholly favourable to Italy. After explaining that his attitude towards Italy had always been a friendly one in spite of the way it had been misrepresented by his opponents, Venizelos went on to discuss the two difficult questions of Northern Epirus and the Dodekanese. .&quot;As regards the former,&quot; he asserted, &quot;I consider that our national claims on Northern Epirus are in no way incompatible with the vital interests of Italy, which push her to possess the mastery of the entranco to the Adriatic. This mastery is assured to Italy by the possession of Valona and by that of the island of Saseno.&quot;  [Cf. article VI of the Treaty of London.] He went on to say that as regards Valona, so long ago as December 1913 he had assured the Marquis Di San Giuliano that Greece would be perfectly content, with an Italian annexation of Valona, Similarly he had never dreamt of raising difficulties as to the occupation of Saseno, but &quot; Northern Epirus is another matter. Its possession is for us an ethical and patriotic question. Dhelvinon, Aryirokastron, and Koritsa have always been foyers, true centres of Hellenic civilisation. When the Conference of London obliged me to withdraw our troops from Northern Epirus, I obeyed without raising objections. When I again sent troops there I did so, taking advantage of the upheaval produced by the war, after having come to an understanding with the Italian Government, not directly, it is true, but through the medium of one of the Powers of the Entente. Believe me, I would never have sent Greek troops into Northern Epirus without the consent of Italy, a consent given me, I repeat, by the intervention of a Power very friendly to you. In any case, I declared to all the Powers, the Centml Empires included, that the occupation of Northern Epirus on the part of our troops did not imply a desire to establish a fait accompli, that I respected the decisions of the Conference of London, and that the question of Northern Epirus ought to be submitted, together with all the other questions, to the general peace conference.&quot;As regarded the question of the iEgean, Venizelos made it clear that he under-stood &quot; very well that Italy may have a vital interest in the Dodekanese, and for this-reason during the Balkan wars I began conversations with Count Bosdari, with a view
to an arrangement on the subject. As the Island of Stambalia (Astipalea) possesses two magnificent harbours which, it is said, were for Italy of great strategic interest, I said to Bosdari, &apos; If Stambalia has indeed a strategic interest for Italy well, let her take it; and if there is another island which Italy holds out for, let her take it too.&apos; But Italy should not forget that the Dodekanese holds the heart of our people, because it is a question of islands profoundly Greek by origin, by sentiment, and by culture. Ours is, then, an entirely ethical interest.&quot;This view of M. Venizelos as to the lines on which agreement over the question of the Dodekanese could be reached was confirmed also in an interview to the &quot;Secolo&quot; by M. Mikhalakopoulos, then Minister of Public Works and now of Agriculture. While asking for Rhodes and the Dodekanese as a whole on racial grounds M. Mikhalakopoulos expressed his willingness to agree to the cession of such an island as Stambalia to Italy.*6. Unfortunately, during the first months of 1917 (i.e., before the publication of these interviews), Greco-Italian relations went from bad to worse. Baron Sonnino&apos;s undisguised support of King Constantine put a great strain on the position of those in Greece who were anxious for a Greco-Italian understanding. Finally the Italian Government yielded to, while it did not approve, the decision of France and Britain to bring about the union of Greece through the elimination of King Constantine. Simultaneously, however, with the energetic action of M. Jonnart, the Italian Govern-ment proclaimed a protectorate over Albania (4th June), including therein Northern&apos; Epirus, which they followed up by the despatch of Italian troops into Greek territory at first as far as the River Kalamas. This action itself and the ill-treatment alleged to have been inflicted by the Italian troops on the Greek population of the province, made the worst impression possible in Greece. The Italian occupation stretched as far south as Yannina and even further, while at the same time the Royalists of the province were shown every favour by the Italian authorities. Fortunately, &apos; through French and British intervention, the occupation of actual Greek territory did not last very long, and by the end of July Italy had promised to withdraw her troops beyond the Greek frontiers of 1913, with the exception of the triangle of land round Poghoniani, which the Italian military authorities considered it necessary to retain for strategic reasons as commanding the road of Santi Quaranta. A leading article in &quot;Nea Ellas&quot; written at the time (early in August) expressed its satisfaction with this withdrawal, and dwelt hopefully on the new prospects for Greco-Italian rapprochement which might ensue. On the 6th August in the Chamber M. Venizelos had regretfully to refuse to admit deputies from Northern Epirus to its deliberations. Owing to the &quot; criminal policy of the anti-Venizelist Governments &quot; Greece now found herself deprived &quot; of the occupation of Northern Epirus which the Liberal Government had succeeded in erecting during the first month of the European war with the concurrence not only of one of the belligerent groups and one member of the opposing belligerent combination, but with the acquiescence also of the remaining Powers of this, combination. To-day, as unfortunately we possess no international title to Northern Epirus, nor even the military occupation of it, we cannot admit the deputies of . Northern Epirus to this Assembly without subverting international law and creating international complications. But&quot; (in spite of this) &quot;we have with Northern Epirus other unwritten bonds, bonds stronger than any declaration of men and any agreementof nations.....Now that Greece shares in the great European war, ready toundergo the necessary sacrifices in the common struggle; now that Greece will not be judged unheard at the Peace Conference which will follow the war, but will necessarily be represented, it is difficult for us to imagine that racial rights to Northern Epirus will be ignored, inasmuch as these harmonise entirely with the aims for which the Allies are carrying on the war.&quot;7. By the 22nd September Yannina and practically the whole of Greek Epirus had been re-occupied, but Northern Epirus has since remained entirely under Italian occupation, with the exception of the North-East corner, where, at Koritsa, from December 1916 till December 1917, the French authorities set up a sort of Albanian Republic. In spite of the temporary loss of Northern Epirus, however, Greco-Italian relations have steadily improved. The new tone of moderation which has marked the Italian press and, to a large extent, the Italian Government since the accession of Signor Orlando to power and the disaster of Caporetto, has been seized on with dtelight in Greece.   So long as Count Bosdari remained at Athens, however, it was difficult for* Three months ago M. Mikhalakopoulos, in conversation with the writer, reiterated his desire to see a solution reached on these lines.[367-39] .   C
6the atmosphere of distrust to be wholly dispelled. But in the beginning of June he was succeeded by Baron Romano D&apos;Avezzana, who hastened to introduce an entirely new spirit into the relations between the two countries. In his first audience with the King Baron Romano spoke of Greece and Italy as &quot; inspired by the same ideal of freedom, justice, and beauty,&quot; and declared himself &quot;determined to make more intimate and more cordial the relations between the two countries.&quot; ITis words were received with enthusiasm by the Greek press; indeed with such enthusiasm as to slightly embarrass him. Lord Granville reports (6th June) that Baron Romano &quot;is afraid lest Greek hopes should have been raised too high,&quot; but Lord Granville understood him to say that Italy had every intention of handing over the Dodekanese to Greece, though a quid pro quo would be required. As regards Albania, it was of vital importance to Italy that Albania should form an independent State, really independent and not a sort of protectorate, but he sees no reason why Greece should not obtain certain frontier rectifications.On the 7th June Baron Romano had a conversation with M. Venizelos. M. Venizelos made it clear that he wanted to enter into negotiations for a regular arrangement with Italy. Baron Romano doubted if the time had come for this, as any arrangement which M. Venizelos agreed to now might disappoint the Greeks later on. At the same time he was most anxious to consolidate Greco-Italian relations. Lord Granville, in conversation with M. Venizelos on the 8th June, learnt from him that he was still of opinion that Greece was justified in her claim to Northern Epirus and also to the Dodekauese, and that he was still willing to allow Italy to retain Stambalia and perhaps another port. M. Venizelos&apos;s position is, in fact, what it has always been. He is anxious to make every concession compatible with the safeguarding of Hellenic unity.Since then a new tone of cordiality has marked Greek references to Italy and Italian to Greece. An interview given by M. Politis, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the &quot;Patris&quot;on 24th July, frankly attributes this to the new spirit which has marked Italian policy and moral since Caporetto. &quot; Italy&apos;s return to the traditions of the immortal Mazzini has brought about her accord with the Jugo-Slavs and her indisputably sincere effort to arrive at a similar accord with Greece.&quot; Given this new attitude on Italy&apos;s part, there was every hope that a &quot; complete accord on vital questions &quot; might eventually be reached and the Greek Government hoped to convince Italy that they desired nothing beyond the &quot; purely national interests of Greece &quot; and &quot; recognised in full Italy&apos;s situation as a great Mediterranean Power, with whom Greece could most advantageously co-operate.&quot;This is the last published utterance to hand of the responsible Greek politicians on their attitude towards Italy.8. In its turn the Italian press has adopted an entirely friendly point of view towards Greek aspirations, corresponding to the friendly attitude of Signor Orlando and the new Italian Minister in Athens. The conciliatory attitude of the &quot; Secolo&quot; has now been copied by many other Italian papers, among them the important &quot; Corriere della Sera.&quot; Especially significant was the appearance at the beginning of July of three important articles in the clerical &quot;Corriere dTtalia,&quot; the following resume of which is taken from the weekly paper &quot; L&apos;Unitk.&quot;* &quot; TJnita&quot; summarises the gist of the articles as follows: (1.) The Greek State and the Hellenic nation constitute an insuppressible political force; consequently, any opposition of ours to them is destined to substantial failure, and definitively brings such a force into line against us.(2.) There are no real and vital Italian interests the satisfaction of which would be incompatible with Greek vital interests.(3.) In the defence of the European-Balkan equilibrium and the closing of the coast of the Mediterranean to the non-Mediterranean powers, our vital interests coincide.&quot; Consequently, it is a legitimate conclusion, that a Greco-Italian agreement not only saves Italy from risks and losses, but actually solidifies our position in Asia Minor, and so in the Mediterranean, in Europe, and in the world.&quot;On the question of the Dodekanese the paper controverts the,point of view that it is an Italian interest to establish Italian sovereignty over the islands, &quot; which are a region demanded by Greek irredentism as an integral part of the Hellenic world.&quot; &quot;The truth is that the Italian position in the Dodekanese in itself is a mere negation,&quot;* July 13.
7economically. &quot; It is true it might be of political value as a starting-point for an Italian hold over the JEgean and Smyrna, but the negative conclusion we have reached with regard to this makes us consequently deny our interest in keeping the Dodekanese for such a reason. All that remains then is our interest in a naval, base, in order to control from the Dodekanese JEgean naval communications and the East-Mediterranean naval equilibrium. But as regards this, Italy cannot demand a privileged and exclusive position. If Italy attains such a naval base, Britain, France, and perhaps Germany and, in the future, Kussia would also attain them. Would this be an Italian interest ? In any case, even if we have such an interest, it can easily be satisfied by the acquire-ment of one of the little islands of the Dodekanese, thereby avoiding the opposition of Greek national interests.&quot; The formula of conciliation over the Dodekanese may therefore be the following: &quot; &apos; Italy recognises the national character of Greek claims to the Dodekanese, and, in her turn, Greece is disposed to recognise in the -ZEgean the vital political and military interests of Italy as a Great Power, especially when analogous vital interests of other Great Powers in the iEgean are recognised.&apos;&quot;&apos; If we do not deceive ourselves,&quot; says &quot; L&apos;Unita,&quot; &quot; the publication of these articles is an excellent sympton of a return to good sense also in Greco-Italian relations. They had been cynically and arrogantly upset by the late Di San Giuliano. They should at least after the outbreak of the European war have been regularised in a spirit of equity; instead, during the years 1915-16-17 they were systematically made worse under the influence of those same elements who also over the Italo-Jugoslav question worked with all their might pour le Roi de Prusse.&quot;o
