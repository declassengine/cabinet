MBOHAIIOAL $BAN93?QBE FOR N.W.PERSIA. A 1 J;Ui I i5W L,J-----------f.......................Ihe only line of oomoiunioation by which we can hope to obtain control of the Caspian and maintain a foroe in North-west fersia is the main road running through Hamadan to JSnzeli.     This road is of great length, and traverses a most difficult country and consequently it will not be possible to substitute a railway which would be completed in time to counter a hostile movement towards Trans-Oaspia and the frontier! Of India.Every effort is being made to improve the road but even so the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, considers that it will not be possible to use heavy motor lorries on it during the winter, which begins about the middle of November, and after that date and for many months the only type of vehicle of practical use will be the Ford Van.     General Marshall has estimated that after making full use of local food supplies (which are not great owing to the depredations of Turkish and Russian armies in the past years of the War) and assuming that he will be supplied witfl. 10 more Ford Van Companies, he will be unable to support East of Kirmanshah during the winter more than 14,000 men and 2,500 animals.      On the other hand it is estimated that the Turks at the present time are supplying a force of nearly 17,000 rifles based on Tabriz which is connected by rail with the Black Sea.General Marshall has committed his forces to North-west Persia and based his calculations on the assumption that he will receive an additional 1,300 Ford Vans by the end of this year.    With these extra Tans and by wothdrawing every van that can be spared from the Army in Mesopotamia it may be possible to maintain a division in Persia, and i&apos; is considered that the situation demands a force of this size at lesfet but it is to be remembered that the depletion of the mechanical trans-port in Mesopotamia proper will seriously affect the mobility of the Army in the plains.Application for these 1,300 Ford Vans was originally made by the War Office to the Ministry of Munitions on the 9th July 19181and
120and on the 2nd August the latter informed the War Office that the Inter-Allied Council could not agree to supply the Vans,    She subject was brought &quot;before the War Cabinet on the 7th August and on the 17th August the War Office was Informed &quot;by the Ministry of Munitions that the Interallied Council had withdrawn, their object-ion,      Befusal of the demand however was given a second time under circumstances which were submitted to the War Oiih inet on the 28th Augusts      She question has been brought to the notice of General Bliss who, on the 26th August, sent a telegram to the President of the War Purchase Council in which he expressed his personal opinion that the request for the vans should be granted8If there is any failure In tho supply of the Ford Vans promised it is not too much to say that General Marshall will be faced with a very grave situation, ,far Office7th September, 1918,
