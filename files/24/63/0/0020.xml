T.ACQUISITION OF LICF.KSED PIWISSS,1:1 gmg ran dura by ( Z or d D1 Alb or no n.(Circulated with reference to Hone Affairs Cwnraittec 10th Minutes, ilinute 4,)(previous Paper G.T.5187),.) V/hile the Court of Appeal &apos;s judgment stands, the CentralControl Board are not in a ptsition to deal with the types of cases mentioned below, however imperatively this may be demanded by any of tho War Departments,     Although the Board have ne such demand under consideration at the present moment, there are two areas in which (they have reason to believe) compulsory acquisition may be necessary in the near future, viz: -(a)   At Inverness.   The advent in large numbers of American naval ratings, and the establishment on a considerable scale of American naval works, have combined with other causes to involve, at the request of the Admiralty and the local naval authorities, a substantial extension southwards in the direction of Inverness of the Board&apos;b Invergordon and Cromarty Firth Direct Control Area. There is at present a good boundary between this extended area and Inverness, but the conditions at Invornoss are such that the necessity may arise for the taking over of the licensed premises at Inverness; but without legislation, re-defining the powers of the Board, it wculd be out of the question for tho Board to attempt oompul*orily to acquire the licensed premises in this area,M   At Chopstow.   The Admiralty have already asked theBoard to consider taking over the licensed premises at Chepstow.   It would be out of the question for the Board, with their powers as defined by the Q/&amp;urt of Appeal, to attempt compulsorily to acquire the licen-sed premises in such an area as Chepstow, and the Board have been compelled to reply to the Admiralty in this sense and to intimate that, without a re-definition of their powers, it is not worth while even to consider the proposition.2) In the Carlisle area, the type of difficulty in which thoB&amp;ard are involved by reason of the Court of Appeal&apos;s judgment . is somewhat different.(a) In certain parts of the Carlisle area, particularlyin the outskirts of the area, there are a good number of premises, of which the Board have not yet taken possession.   In some of these cases their entry is now being obstructed, and their power to acquire compulsorily except on the dilatory and expensive terms of the Lands Clauses Acts (in some cases even their power to acquire compulsorily at all) is being seriously disputed. In a few of the outlying villages, and in one or two  4 towns a highly detrimental situation is thus being created.(b). In tho
A very rough estimate, given with all reserve., of tho cost of acquisition at Inverness and Chopstow would be  250,000; while that of the houses in the Carlisle area whore obstruction is threatened may be put at  50,000.   But important as it is that the Board should not be compelled to purchase licensed property under extravagant financial conditions, the more important and which the proposed legislation will secure will\ ti enable the Board, if and when the contingency arises, to exercise the powers which parliament intended to confer in 1910 Action by the Board, to   be effective, must be prompt,   This is! an essential of the problem of direct control as a War measure, in the present position the Board cannot guarantee prompt actii it is, for instance, certain that if the Board attempted to approaoh the problem at Inverness, they would be resisted.(3d.)   D! ABBRNON,Central Control &quot;oard, (Liquor Traffic), Lwtymer House,134, Pico dilly,, Vi.,1..5th September, 1918.(b)       In the Carlisle area there art- some properties 0f -which the Board have been in possession for the Taost part of two years, without being able to .settle tho compensation to be paid.   In these eases the; owners have bo en holding out for exorbitant terms, and sobiq, of than, encouraged by the Court of Appeal&apos;s judgment are threatening or instituting legal proceedings to compel payment of compensation on a Lands Glauses bo This particular type of case, though its settlement would be facilitated by legislation, is of important only from the financial side, and docs not (like the other types described) impede, or threaten to impede, the proper control of the liquor traffic.
