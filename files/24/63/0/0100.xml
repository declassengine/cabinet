&quot; 306,  * :TUia ttfcPUElit 13 TUB WEBTV 0?. HIS BMtAMWIC JWftBTftp OOTBtoTOJ!I  SECRET.WAH CABIOT.THE MILITARY COSMUD IN TUB MIDDLE EAST,X regard the military situation in thi Kiddle Saat ts very unsatisfactory,    While on all other fronts we are holding or driving back ine enemy, his advance in the QaAXoamia^ Traneceepia, and North feat Persia continues.   And this is a matter which in a very special degree concerns the British Kmpire and ifcft future in Aaia*    If the enemy reaches Central Persia and Afghanistan next summer, a situation might arise on the&apos; Indian frontier which would cripple btir military effort from Palestine and Salonica to Central Asia.from this point of view our holding of the Baghdad-Hamadan-Bnzeli line and denial of the Caspian to the enemy in a matter of cardinal importance,    Baku is almost certain to be lost, but that does not mean the lose&apos;of the Caspian^    If m can hold on to Enzeli and Krasnovodsk and obtain control of at any rate a portion of the Caspian fleet, while our friends in Russia hold Petrovsk and Astrachan, an enemy advance across the Caspian and towards the centre of Persia and the border of Afghanistan will be prevented.    Once this situation is definitely stabilised, a blow might be struck against the Turks at Mosul which would have far-reaching results.The misfortune is that jRur commanders in that area are either incompetent or willim cannot   grasp the situation. Dunsterville was sent to Baku to obtain control of the Caspian fleet, but his efforts have mostly gone to waste in another direction-     General Marshall again, good military commander m he is, does not seem to realise the larger and wider strategy of the enemy which has denuded his Tigris front of troops and is outflanking his whole position in Mesopotamia by a great movement to Persia and Transcaspla*   His eyes are kept unmovftkjjr  fixed on the Tigris front, which has for the moment losw all importance.    He has been most dilatory in moving troops towards the Caspian, and he now proposes to withdraw Troops from Snaeli westwards in order to meet the Turkish menace from the direction of Tabriz    If Enseli is evacuated, we could   not hope to hold out at Krasnovodsk, and the Caspian route will fall completely under enemy control,- and the menace to Afghanistan will at once become serious. General Marshall has all along exaggerated his transport &apos; difficulties.    At first he could only maintain 1,000 1*&quot;* ntry on motor cars;   later he found he could maintain an inf* ntry brigade, and X am under the impression that he has not grappled seriously with the situation, Just because he does not realise our dangers in that area and the strategy to be followed.The Government of India, realising the gravd dangers, and the necessity for a unified command over that vast area, has proponed that the conduct of   operations shall be put under the control of the Commander-in-Chief in&quot; India.   This the War Office oould not, for good and sufficient reasons, agree to. But I feel sure unity of command in the Kiddle Bast is necessary, as all moves and operations in Mesopotamia, Persia and Turkestan will henceforth be interdependent.   This command should, however, remain direct under the War Office.    The solution .I would propose io the following.
307I have &quot;been struck for months rfcw by the insight whioh Sir Charles Mnnro has shown into the military situation in that vast theatre.   His judgments have been, mostly sound and sure, while those of General Marshall have iiisj&amp;rfcd me with no confidence.     I would suggest that Sir Charles J onrh raoate his position as Commander-in-Chief in India and be given the entire command - from Baghdad to Eeshed.      As CommancW^in^ Chief in India should be appointed a man who will work liw-olose harmony with him.    For General Marshall another suitable fcpiwtf^ of work should be found;   I do not think he has- the stratesgio mind to&apos; oope with the situation now developing in the East, Events are moving fast and whatever is done should be done quickly.(Intd.)
