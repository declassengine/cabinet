This has rarely happened before-the total British merchant tonnage lost since the outbreak of war being more than 50 per cent, greater than the losses of the other Allies and Neutrals combined.
The Table in Appendix I shows the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of losses Losses of by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of all merchant steamships, British both British and Foreign, of over 500 tons gross register, and the Table in Appendix II and Foreign is a summary of those percentages for recent weeks. in TradwDuring the week under review not only are the losses of tonnage engaged in United Kingdom trades considerably less, but the tonnage which arrived at or left home ports during the week was considerably greater than in the previous week, making the percentage of losses to sailings in all such trades - 39 as against - 90 last week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by in which enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.Notwithstanding the increased number of submarines operating, the number of attacks in the week under review declined considerably. On the Ocean routes and off the American Coast about the same activity was experienced as in the previous week, and in the English. Channel submarine operations were resumed, but in the North Sea and particularly in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel there was a considerable falling-off in the number of. enemy attacks.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoy Vessels which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such - convoyed.

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. France.Rear-Admiral Merveillaux du Vigneaux, C.B., lately commanding the Salonika Division, has been appointed Chief of Staff to the French Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean.Spain.Germany has not yet shown any intention of giving way to Spain on the question of the immunity of Spanish shipping in the barred zones, and is attempting to negotiate by offering greater facilities in the issue of safe-conducts, and other evasive measures, The recent announcement of the Allies as to dealing with vessels holding these safe-conducts will undoubtedly embarrass Germany in this matter, and it is believed that the Spanisl Government will maintain a firm attitude in its decision to seize interned enemy tonnage to replace future losses.Meanwhile two Spanish vessels have been torpedoed in the barred zones, viz. the s.s. &quot; Carasa,&quot; on 25th August, with a loss of six lives, and the &quot; Atxeri-Mendi,&quot; on 29tl August, but the Spanish Government has postponed decisive action until complete report! on these losses are obtained.Naval Staff,5th September, 1918.[Appendices!
