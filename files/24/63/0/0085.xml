Bishop&apos;s Rock Light.  Vessels were sent to her assistance and she was. brought to St. Mary&apos;s Roads, Scilly Isles.   There were no casualties to troops or ship&apos;s company and it is reported that the attacking submarine was destroyed by the escorting vessels.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.The number of large enemy submarines of a type which operates further afield than Submarines the North Sea, which were located during the week, was 18, again including five of the operating. &quot; cruiser &quot; type. AOf these latter, one converted &quot; Deutschland,&quot; one of the improved type, and one new class minelayer were working in the Atlantic homeward bound from the North American coast. One converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; was in the vicinity of the Canaries, and one new class minelayer was off the French coast of the Bay of Biscay. The remaining large boats were operating chiefly in the Bay of Biscay and in the Irish Sea. There was a marked reduction of activity in the North Sea, but two boats, probably of the Flanders Flotilla, were operating off the coast of Portugal.(C14001  Wt   50-9/18  R &amp; S

In future, therefore, a Table comparing the figures for the two -previous months will be appended monthly and the weekly comparison discontinued.It will be seen that the tonnage engaged in United Kingdom Overseas Trades in August was appreciably greater than in July, while the August losses were slightly less than those in the previous month, making the percentage of losses to sailings in these trades 1.35 for August as against 1.45 for July. On the other hand, there was a somewhat greater percentage of loss in the later month so far as regards Cross-Channel and Coasting Trades, with the result that the percentage of losses to sailings in all United Kingdom Trades was .65 in August as against .58 in July. The losses on non-United Kingdom Trades were very similar in each month.
257The Table in Appendix IT is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British&apos;, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by in which enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.&quot;Notwithstanding that about the same number of enemy submarines were operating in the last two weeks, a considerably smaller number of attacks were made in the week under review. Enemy activity, both in the North Sea and English Channel, was very slight, but there is some increase of activity to record in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel. The vessels which have recently been operating off the American coast were on passage home during the week.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoy Vessels which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoyed.

4The losses of World tonnage in August due to enemy action, remain at about the average oi the last few months, but if British, losses alone are considered the tonnage sunk by the enemy in August was considerably less than in any month since September, 1916, and is even less than the corresponding losses sustained m August, 1915.Daily The following Table shows the Daily Average of World Tonnage Sunk by Enemytonnage0f   ^ction an-d of British Merchant Tonnage Sunk or Damaged by Enemy Action, or attacked    Escaped from Attack, for each month since Unrestricted Submarine Warfare commenced, standardized by taking 100 as the Daily Average for February, 1917, in each case:-Month.

258Notwithstanding the reduction in tonnage losses by enemy action in August there is a net loss of British tonnage to record for the month. This is clue partly to a greater tonnage than usual having been lost owing to ordinary marine casualty and partly to the restricted output of new vessels. The tonnage transferred from foreign flags also has now fallen to a very low figure.Owing, however, to a further reduction during the month of about 10 per cent, in the British tonnage under and awaiting heavy repairs, the British tonnage available for service was greater by nearly 30,000 tons at the end than at the beginning of the month.The net gain or loss in the total tonnage of the British Mercantile Marine in recent Corn-months is shown below:  parative1917.November DecemberNet Gain.

No enemy ships have entered or left mm. Rotterdam.(0 1400) A 3
0FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. France.Rear-Admiral Grasset, who has been appointed Naval Attache to the French Embassy in London., has recently relinquished the command of the Atlantic Cruiser Division, where he has been co-operating with our North American Squadron.Spain.The crisis with Germany on the question of the sinking of Spanish vessels remains serious. It is possible that a solution may be found by the Spanish Government accepting an offer from Germany to lease some of the ships to Spain, or to replace certain of the Spanish vessels recently sunk outside the barred zone, but any step on the part of the Spanish Government to recede from the position taken up in the Note of 14th August is almost certain to lead to a Ministerial crisis.The Government propose-to requisition all merchant vessels and to establish a service which will regulate imports and exports according to economic and political require-ments.Italy.Rear-Admiral Secchi, the Director of Operations, has been appointed Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff in succession to Rear-Admiral Triangi.The rank of Commodore has been recently instituted in the Italian Navy, and four Captains are to be promoted to that rank.Russia.A reign of terror now exists in Petrograd, and the Germans are arresting and handing over to the Bolsheviks Russian officers suspected of desiring to escape to join the Allies. These unfortunate men are immediately shot without trial, and Admiral Razvozoff, ex-Commander-in-Chief of the Baltic Fleet, and numerous other officers have already suffered the extreme penalty on this plea.In Northern Russia the Allies have driven the Bolsheviks from their position at Oboserskaya on the railway, and the latter are retreating. It has now been definitely decided to continue in occupation of Pechenga as it is the policy of the Allies to hold that harbour and the Kola inlets, the control of which by Germany would greatly facilitate the achievement of enemy objects.The Allies have recentlv taken over from the Russians in the Arctic Sea one cruiser, 17 trawlers, 4 destroyers, 3 yachts and 3 icebreakers, which will be manned by British French or American crews.In the further supplementary treaty, dated 2nd September, between Germany and the Bolsheviks, it has been agreed amongst other things that after the ratification of the Russo-Ukranian Treaty, Germany will evacuate all the Black Sea region, exclusive of the Caucasus, and that Germany recognises that all warships taken after the ratification of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty (*.e., primarily the Black Sea Fleet) are the property of Russia.Baku, was still holding out on the 5th inst., and it is reported that Bicharakov took Petrovsk on 2nd September, and sent forward to Baku five steamers with reinforcements consisting of 12,000 Cossacks under Liakhov.Four destroyers and two submarines Avhich were building at Nicolaev are now reported to have been completed in March, 1918.There are as yet no indications regarding the possibility of thfe Russian Black Sea Fleet being used for offensive purposes by the enemy. The manning of the Russian ships by Germany is not altogether a matter of naval expediency as the German Foreign Office is not in agreement with the naval authorities. The difference of opinion arises from the fact that the Ukraine have claimed the Black Sea Fleet, and any attempt on Germany&apos;s part to use it would only augment the friction between the two countries. All the big ships are at Sevastopol. They are flying no flags and have no crews, but there are German sentries on each ship.
Although the minefields outside Sevastopol and Odessa have not been cleared, mine-sweeping is still in progress. Russian T.BDs. are taking part in these proceedings under German supervision, and swept and buoyed channels are in use for merchant vessels. The merchant vessels in Sevastopol are flying the moraine flag.China.Reports indicate that the Southern forces -are about to advance on Amoy, the present base of such units of the Chinese Fleet as continue to obey Peking. Although a recent similar attack on Foochow was not attended by any outrages on foreigners, precautions cannot be neglected. A British sloop is at present in the harbour at Amoy, where the large majority of foreigners live on a small island opposite the native quarter.The nearest Japanese Naval Base is at Bako in the Pescadores, roughly 100 miles away. One light cruiser and two destroyers are attached to it, but no recent reports of their movements have been received.Naval Staff,12th September, 1918.[Append ice
