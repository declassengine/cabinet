107(a .    P(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIO MAJESTY15 GOVERNMENT),S EGRET.     ,-      ^ ......0.T.6Q34. \ -      W A Rj    C A B I EUTHE INVESTIGATION OP PROFITS IN INDUSTRY, (Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works)&apos;In view of the labour unrest, end the continual accusations of profiteering and excessive  xrofits in various industries, it would appear to me that a most useful purpose would be served if the Government would establish a saal1 committee of expert economists and accountants to investigate authoritatively the average interest earned on industrial capital over a number of years.     This would  . do much to check the growing tendency to pick out certain companies, which, either by special processes, or exceptionally good manage-ment, or low capitalisation, appear to be earning very largo profits, whereas, the industry, taken as a whole, is probably yielding a low return.Investigations of this i-zind have been rnsde in tha pest, but I am not aware that any authoritative investigation has been made in recent years.If workmen can be convinced that the return to the capitalist in industry is not more than is justified by the uncertainty and risk of returns, and that there is not an unlimited&apos; -amount of profits out of v/hiob their wages can be indefinitely increased, I feel certain It will do a good deal to allay unrest, end unreasonable demands.   As most large industries are now controlled by limited liability companies, whose balance sheets are mblic property, a ^ood deal of the information is available.   I up not think that large ^mnloyers, who are all interested in this question, would be averse to giving all the information that is required to a carefully selected committee.I would propose that if this Idea is approved, .,;.\e President of the tJoard of Trade be requested to draft the Reference, and nominate the Oonrnittee.(Signed)      ALFRED MOIID.H.M.
