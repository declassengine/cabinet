Central of Wages. tyemaranduro by the ICinister of Labour.My predecessor^ms,&apos; I understand, considering his reply to the Barks of Lord llilhar on the control of wages, but it has been aseuiaed it in the changed cirourastanoes the discussion on the lines proposed the War Office had lapsed.   It id now understood that the Flaanoinl jretary to the War Offioe is still desirous that Lord HilnerTs paper mid be considered.   $he following remarks are therefore made.Hostilities have ceased since the War Office memorandum was written, i adverse results duo to lack of co-ordination of wages to Which ;ention is drawn by the War Office are:-(1) Independent action of purchasing departments in fixing wages.(2) Collusive agreements between employers and employees stimulated by the knowledge that the Government pays the bill.(3) Failure of the Ministry of Labour to criticise agreements as to wages, and generally to take oontrol.All of those difficulties havo now oeased to exist.As regards (1)., the powers used by the Hinistry of Munitions and admiralty for fixing wages&apos;under the Munitions of. War Acts havo &quot;boon lushed by the Wages (Temporary aegulatioh) &amp;ot, 1918.As regards (2), the. abnormal war conditions which made collusion bible have disappeared.,   Tho pressure o.n industry for supplies necessary( military purposes has disappeared-.   GoYornEiont contracts are being idly reduced and;employers know that further increases of wages may s it impossible to produce goods et a price at which the;: can soil them.As regards (3wages in industry are now regulated by the,Wages mporary Regulation) Act, 1918,-undbr which it is provided that rates sting on November 21st, 1910, arc to bo paid until lay  1st, 1919, opt: -(a) By agreements for other rates only legally binding if approved by the liinister of Labour.(b) other rates imposed by arbitration. &apos;There is thus a totally new situation/ and the.intervention of Jhasing departments in wages paid on Government contracts can again be ited as it was before the war to directions given in accordance with Pair Wages.Olause in Government contracts,   Similarly, the wages of Loyees in the direct employment of Government Departments can again be alated by comparison with prevailing civilian rates in private life.In the circumstances it appears to me that however; useful the ?suggestions of the War Office might have been during the war period, the 1$:vention of the State in wages questions must now be settled from a &apos;lly. different point of view, and&quot; it does not appear&apos; that any purpose I be served by a detailed consideration of the memorandum of the retary of State for War.(Signed) 2. S. E&apos;HH3. February 1919. &apos;., .
