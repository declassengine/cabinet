ffllS,DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC. MAJESTY&quot; S. .^VJgRN!MDB!NT \ ^II E C R E T,   19I WAR CABINET *T, -6852.ORGANISATION OF STATE METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE. (Memorandum byi the Air Council.)The Air ffeuncil have been requested by the Department Of Scientific and Industrial Research to furnish their observa-tiens en the proposal tr jplade the control of the &quot;Meteorological tffioe under the Committee of the privy Oounoil for Soien-scientific and Industrial Research.   A ?opy cf the letter containing, the request and outlining the suggested scheme cf relation-ship &quot;between the central Meteorological Office and the Air Ministry is. attached for reference (Annexure A).&apos; &apos;      The Air Council desire to submit to the home   Affairs Committee of the War Cabinet that the proposed transfer if carried into effect will perpetuate a duplication of state meteorological services which is admitted at present to (-exist but which both for financial and admini st rat ire., reasons   \ it.appears&quot; desirable to terminate.This duplication can in the view.of the Air Council be avoided only if the Meteorological Service is. placed under the oontrol of the Air Council,fee necessity of supplying accurate looal me t e cr cdjogiaal. information for aviation purposes has produced a network, in the United Kingdom and abroad, &quot;of meteorological stations for the Royal Air Force.   These are SO in number as against 7 Of the Meteorological office -and. are.station for station, as well, or better equipped than the others.   This netv/ork oannot be reduced for peaoe. purposes to any great extent in the United Kingdom as meteorological information must still be supplied not only to the various aerodromes, seaplane bas-en.. and airship stations which are to be retained for military purposes but also, as civil and commercial aviation grows,, to safeguard the public and to meet the requirements of aerial commerce and engineering.   Abroad it will be necessary largely to develop the Royal Air Force service to provide what Trill become in aK&amp;ot the, meteorological lighthouses along&apos; the great aerial routes of the British Empire.A very important part of the Royal Air F&quot;rce system -which must net be forgotten is the &quot;methods of the dissemina* tion of meteorological information, a highly organised system depending largely&apos; on the.general administrative machinery of the Air Force and one which in the future will-, to a great extent be carried out by wireless telegraphy, with. Service apparatus and Service personnel.Tho supply of information, olimatio investigation and. -reseajoh for flying purposes can- only be carried out by personnel- -rho thoroughly understand and are intimately acquainted with the climatio requirements of flying and such experience aan only be gained by oloae oontast -sith the people who do the flying,   $he Royal Air yoree officer trained in meteorology is alearly thv. only type who oan be entrusted with this /
work as a Government Service,   While moreover the Royal Air force is only concerned with that part of Meteorology which affects flying, the information obtained-by means of its network of stations, with their trained personnel, by the facilities for obtaining upper air data, and by the wireless and telephonic systems is the same information as that required for the wido field of public interests served by the Meteorological Office.The Air Council accordingly submit that (1) there can be no&apos;doubt of the necessity for the retention of a system of meteorological stations under the control of the Air Ministry to provide information for flying purposes and (2) that the organisation for collecting and disseminating meteorological information required for other than aeronautical purposes will essentially, deoend upon air-force personnel and equipment, and that (3) for these reasons it would be unsound for the Meteorological Office to be responsible to any Department other than the Air Ministry,The ;;lr Council fully recognise the number and importance of navigational, agricultural and other non-aeronautical interests for which under -existing arrangements provision is made by the Meteorological Office.   They are confident that in meeting their own noeds they can&quot;also provide for these other needs and they would propose that it should be a condition of the transfer of the Meteorological Office to tho Air Ministry that an Advisory iioard containing depart-mental representatives of&apos;these various interests as well as independent experts should be set uo to advise the :.ir ministry in meteorological matters.   It should be added that in the scheme for the&apos; ie-organisation of the Air Ministry it is proposed that the civil  o :;art-ment Of civil aviation shall assume -1esponsibi1 ity for meteorological services.A IB MliUSMY.12th February, 1919.
AlfJBXURB A.DEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND-INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH.15, Great George Street, Westminster,London. S.-:&apos;f*l,*10th January 1919.Sir,I have been asked by the Home /affairs Committee of the Cabinet to consult the Air Ministry in the following circumstances:   *At a meeting of the Committee of Home Affairs on Thursday, November 21st last, they had under consideration the future organisation of a central meteorological service for the Government and the Comr.ittee decided, subject to any representations which the departments immediately concerned might wish to make, to give their approval to the proposal to transfer the meteorological Office, which is at present under the Treasury, to the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, enlarging the po?fers  &quot; of the Committee of Council so as to enable this to be done. It we a not in the mind ot the Committee of Home Affairs to concentrate allmeteorolo^lcsl Fork in the office thus trans-furred.   They thought it possible that&apos; your Ministry might desire to make their own arrangements for such meteorological work as ,as necessary for the, purposes of your Department and for which provision could not conveniently be made by a central office.   It was also recognised that the collection of observations in the air for the purposes of your Ministry as well as for the central rfl&amp;teorolorical service must continue to be made by the Air Force,* But the intention Is that if the meteorological       *Office is transferred in the manner proposed the departmental meteorological services should be very closely linked up with the central service in the two following ways:-(a) the Meteorological Office would be under the control of an Executive Board responsible to the Minister.Departmental representatives would sit upon this fioardj and(b) it is suggested that accommodation at the central office, which would probably be transferred to a place in the neighbourhood of Whitehall, could be set aside for Technical Officers of the departmental services which would thus be kept in Intimate touch with the organisation and current work of the central service; they would also have direct access   -to the library and records which have been accumu- -lated.This outlined scheme has already been discussed in-formally between Sir &quot; .A. Robinson and myself.As the whole matter has to come again before the Home Affairs Committee, of the Cabinet at an early date I should be greatly obliged if I could be furnished with the observations of your Ministry as soon as possible.I am,The Secretary, Sir,Air Ministry, Your obedient Servant,Strand,    .0.2*H.
