On Friday a thaw setxm, accompanied in some districts by rain, but ploughing is still impossible in most districts.Pen wheats have suffered from the frost, but in Anglesey winter wheat looks promising.     In ^id-Wales &amp;arly lambs arq suffering from the alternate frosts and wot, and in the south-eastern counties the hard weather has necessitated serious inrc&amp;ds   ti sttcks of straw and hay.L cal Organisation Division.:!:-rv &apos; f Agricultural Executive Coinmittoes, roceivedTn tico fr^m the B afel o  Inland rtly be obliged to withdraw tho servicesrecentlywould irish&apos;rxiy oe c their staff whn .havo beep employed during the war Agricultural i&amp;ecutive Committees.

The owner is resuming - occupation at Ladyday-next and the authority is required in order to enable him to carry out the necessary cultivations, none of which are being proceeded with by tho tenant.     The authority has therefore boen granted, and tha Committee will take possession cf the farm and buildings and will cultivate it by the owner as their agent until such time as he is able to enter into occupation,Petermination ^f Tenancies,      during the week two Orders have been issued determining tenancies on account of bad farming in respect Of 88 acres.     In one of these cases, the Executive Committee had had the farm, which is situate at South Heighton in -Jast buss ox, under observation since October 1917.     v-ost of it had fallen into an almost derelict condition owing to the neglect and want cf capital of the tenant and the Committee considered the advisability of taking possession of it;   the tenanfs brother, however, undertook to see that the land was efficiently farmed and it was decided to leave the oontrcl at the farm in his hands.     The Committee continued to exercise the olosest supervision of the land and inspections were made at regular intervals.     It lias now been reported to the Board that no appreciable improvement has taken place during the past year and that none can be expected under the present tenancy.     The Board have therefore issued ft Order determining tho tenancy which will take effect according to V.e usual procedure under the C^rn Production (Amendment) Act, 1918.Land Drainage.     The Board have made a further exercise of their powers under beotion 1? of the Land Drainage Act, 1918, and have made Orders constituting Drainage Committees in Berkshire, in Lancashire and in the Jilast Riding of Yorkshirefl     In Lancashire the Committee will consist af 15 members, cf whom 10 will be appointed by the County Council and 5 by the Board.
Allotments.     The Board*s Inspectors continue to instigate Local Authorities to acquire land fcr allotments with the result       j that 4 more Authorities have undertaken to acquire undnr thft iCultivation of Land Order       acres of land which will provide 438 allotments;   one area of 20 acres will, it is hoped, be acquired on a 7 years lease under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act.   Owing to the action of the Inspectors in various other areas, land has been let for allotments by landowners direct to the cultivators.Horticultural Divio ion,.iffrult Section,Meetings have been attended and growers advised at Bexfsrd, Hadleigh, Thorlcw, Little ialdringfield, Groton.

It is expected that ab^ut 100 m&amp;n will start shortly, and it is hoped when the scheme is in full working order to treat 1,000 men at one time.Swanwick, Hant3.    In th$ Swanwick area there is roeaa for improvement in the oultivation and cropping of allotments, and numerous interviews with allotment leaders have taken place, and advioe given to them.Arndd, Notts.      A pruning demonstration was given to 30 pe^pla, who w**re keenly interested in the work,    questions as to the types of trees, stocks, varieties, etc., were dealt with,    Plum tra&amp;s around Nottingham are badly affected with &quot;Brown Hot&quot;, many of th* growers knowing nothing &apos;rf the affects cf this disease, and attributing the damage which it does te spring frests,Primsby.   An area of 8 acres of school gardens has besn examined at the rsques$ ef the Horticultural Instructsr for tho County:   very good work is being done there.    Tho scholars aro receiving a sound tuition, which should prove of great value to them, and to the country later on.     Tho vegetable cr*ps produced after supplying the whole of the children&apos;s homes, leave a considerable surplus for market.    Previous to the Local Authority taking the field over, a market gardener was in possession, and gave it up because he could not make it pay, whereas by treating it intensively the Instructor has made a profit even with unskilled juvenile labour.Radnor,   At a Conference convened by the Horticultural sub-Co:&apos;amittee it was resolved that neans should be adopted to ;iake public that sprayers were available for hire in order to proceed with the cleaning of fruit trees.

At a Conference of the Horticultural Sub-Committoo a Scheme sot up for placing discharged soldiers on tho land v/as disoussod, .aud it was considered that tho land in question would provide allotments; &apos;and market gardens for 6 suitable men.Quinton (Birmingham)     A pruning demonstration was given on trees which were previously reported to ho much damaged by the free use of paraffin oil.     It was noticed that the advice given en tho previous visit had l:oon followed with good results, tho owner, further, on the present occasion undertook tc grub up and. burn trees of black currants badly affected with &quot;Big Bud&quot;.Small holdings and allotment areas have also been visitod for the purpose of observing types of buildings and huts suitable for reproduction in small holding colonies etcTeohnioal Division,Inspection of Land. -   A visit was paid to Bliokling Park, Norfolk, in connection with an application made by the Agricultural jlxeoutivo Committee for authority to enter into possession.     The park is 400 acres in extent, and is surrounded by farms mainly under arable cultivation;   consequently there has always been a kean demand for the grass from the surrounding farmers.     During the past few years, however, the park has been in the.hands of the military authorities and large numbers of troops have been stationed thoro.     The    *? trops left some months ago. but the military have not yet relinquished possession.     Tho soil cf the park varies from light gravel, to moderately heavy loam;   the natural herbage is poor,, and bracken flourishes under the trees, but is stunted and thinly distributed in the open,     During tho military occupation, tjie turf has been closely grazed and well trodden, and much of the bracken cut for bedding;   tho condition of the park is therefore favourable for further improvement, An area cf about 23 acres on the north side was broken up by order of tho Committee in February, 1918, and a good crop of cats secured,     A further i?rder has recently been issued in respect of atoout 40 acres of similar clear land adjoining, and if this is tackled at once the results should be equally satisfactory.     The proper utilisation of tho rest cf the park is complicated by the presence of a herd of deer, recently reduced from 250 to 50 head.     The Agents f *r tho estate would welcome tho total destruction of the herd, but there aro legal difficulties, and while willing to carry the reduction process still further, their view is that they must stop short of t6tal extincticn.On the whole,the Agents appear to have boon reasonably amenable to the Executive Committee, and the Inspector suggests that the owner8 should be given an opportunity of improving for grazing purposes that part of the park lying fiutaido tho area ploughed tr to be ploughed. This might be done by such means as sheep-folding, suitable manuring, pig-keeping, etc     It is clear, however, that so lf*ng as any deer remain, enly tho owners could be expected-- to undertake improvement cn these linos.     The surest method of obtaining an imaediato return from the park is to insist sn the breaking of tho 40 acres reforrod to above. The Committee might also consider the question of serving an order relative to tho improvement cf the remainder for grazing purposes,I       tash.   Frequent examinations aro made of some cf the waste substances new being used as potash fertiliser, for the purpose of finding out whether injurious constituents are present,     Rocently a sample of potassic fortilisor was found to contain quantities of load and zinc that would have had very bad effects on plants.     A sample cf a Swedish preparation has been examined:   it could be prepared in considerable quantity, but unfortunately it only contains 4 , - b% of potash (KnO).

The demobilisation of the Agricultural Companies is being proceeded with gradually.     The maximum strengtn of tho Companies at the beginning of January was 72,051, and the strength now is 47,514, a reduction of 24,537 men during the last six w&amp;eks.J^^^h^J-satj^fin.   A return received from tho V/ar Office shews that up to the 12th*instant 53,933 officers and man formerly in Agriculture hal Icon demobilised since tho dato of the Armistice^   Numerous complaints continue to be received, however, that &quot;pivotal&quot; men whose names havo boon sent in to the Department of Demobilisation and Re settlement h&amp;70 not yet been released.     In ;.viow of tho backwardness uf farm work and tho short ago of labour gonoraily it is absolutely oasential that tho romaindor of the &quot;pivotal&quot; men should bo demobilised at once, and tho reloaso of agriculturists genurally speeded up.   Representations on the matter aro Leing made to the Department of Demobilisation.Iris oners of -var.     V/ith the return of agriculturists Prisoners of Mr engaged cn agricultural w**rk are being withdrawn as soon as this becomes possible without adversely affecting f^od production.     In most Counties, however, labour is so short that there is no risk at present of prisoners interfering in any way with the engagement of civilians, A largo demand for labour will arir,e early next month as so an as father conditions improve and the retention of prisoner labour tc moot this domand is necessary, if cultivations are tc bo maintained,

Much of the material had been used in the Counties ard had been sent to the Depot as being beyond local repair,,     The tractors worth repairing had been overhauled and these realised very good prices.     Overtime tractors realised from  100 to  170; Moguls from  100 to  115; and a Sa underson Tractor realised  260.Horse Scheme.     The prices previously realised at horse sales were well maintained during the past week.     The total number of horses sold to date is about 2, 00, and the average price obtained rather over  60.Steam Tackle.   During the past week 140 acres were ploughed and 3k&apos;acres mole drained.     The low acreage is primarily due to bad weather but in addition i my sets of tackle are out of commission undergoing repair for spring ploughing.Commercial Division. ;Fertilisers.   The position as regards control of production and sale next season has been discussed with a representative, body of Superphosphate Makers who were in favour of its continuance with some modifications.     It is doubtful whether any system of control Can be arranged on a purely voluntary basis, as although most manufacturers would, be content to comply with any arrangements that might be made, a minority would probably refuse, and thus render a uniform system impossible.     Compulsory powers therefore appear to be necessary in order to secure any effective continuance of the arrangements which have been found to work so satisfactorily during the war.     An enquiry on this point has been addressed to the Treasury Solicitor.Superphosphate.   The prospects of the future supply of    -   -Phosphate Rock are far from satisfactory.     The estimated production of the North African mines is very much less than before the war, and after satisfying the demands of France, the surplus available for the Allies and neutral countries is not likely to exceed 500,000 tons, whereas the quantity required by the United Kingdom alone is estimated at 400,000 - 450,000 tons.     The diminution, in the imports from North Africa will Probably necessitate importation from Florida and the Pacific at higfer prices, and will result in a substantial increase in the prioe oi Superphosphate in this country next season.Sulphate of Ammonia,   deliveries for agricultural Purposes in the eight months June I5T8    January 1919, have amounted to 156,000 tons as compared with 137,000 tons in the same period in tha precede season, an increase of 14 per cent.     In the case of basic slag, the figures are 374,000 tons in the current season as compared with 324,000 tons last season, an increase of 16 per    . cent.tt,nnlv of Drain ?lpes,   The output of drain pipes during the p*3t m yearn has been m^h reduced owmS to the shorty of
2 5 (2labour and coal, and the cassation of brick-making *     With an improved supply of labour and development in brick-making, the supplies may be expected to become more normal.     The prices of drain pipes are, however, vory high, and there is little prespset of any reduction as tho two main items in the cost are labour and coal. Indeed the? opinion of several people in the trade is that prices may be expected to riss rather than to fall.     Makers have no stc?cko in hand since they are able to sell their output as it is produced. The demand would probably be larger than it is but for the high prices, as buyers appear to be helding back on this account.-marketing,,   The number of Fruit and Vegetable Societies bo far registered is 23;   5 others are in process of formation.     In addition, 23 Counties, although they have not definitely formed Societies have some organisation, such as stalls at markets fcr the sale of Horticultural produce,     7 .. Counties have taken no action.The position of th* 23 Societies has bean somewhat changed by the termination of the war, and the line of their future development is now being considered,,     a meeting cf representatives has been convened to discuss tl :s qw itidn.Transport,     The railway position appears to bo much easier than it was at this time last year and ntit many complaints are being received of delays in transit.Enquiries as to districts requiring additional transport facilities ara being made in order that the Board may \e in a position to advise as soon as any policy in regard to this question is settled.flart Disease,     Preparations ara being made to issue an Order relating te the export of susceptible varieties of seed potatoes frcm Scotland as soon as a further communication is received from the Board&apos;of Agriculture for Scotland.Testing of Seeds Order,     Up to the end of January., 215 official samples of seedTHad been drawn by the Board5s Inspectors and tested at the Official Station.

The final decision as to the location of the facTcory^has s^Tll to be taken.   It seems practically certain that it will be either Bridgewater or Haslington.   At Bridge-water there is a difficulty about acquiring the land necessary, as on part of it there are three or four freehold cottages which are, more or less, in a dilapidated condition.   At Haslington      the farmers Co-operative society are exceptionally keen that we should place the factory on the site offered by them.   They promise the whey at l/&amp;rd.d. per gallon and offer the necessary land for  50. Aa mentiokiad before the only difficulty is the Water Supply. This has recently been examined very carefully by experts and the Branchnow expeoting a report.   The preparation of the plans and the designing of the apparatus is being pressed forward ao as to avoid possible further delay.Rennet. The Branch, in       conjunction with the Government Laboratories is going most carefully into the standardisation of cheese rennet.   Up to the present, there has been no standard in England and on full examination the method adopted by the trade in estimating strength has been found to be one which could not be absolutely defined, and wouJ.d, therefore, be of no value in the case of a prosecution.Investigations have been carried&apos;out by an officer of the Branch and a definite method of estimating the strength of reniBb has been devised.   This method is now being examined by the Government Laboratories.Publications Branch.   The number of applications for ordinary issues of1 the leaflets was 1692, in response to whioh 4380 copies were despatched.In addition, 11,300 copies of the leaflets were des-patched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.Applications were received for 530 copies of the three Sound Volumes of Leaflets, and 233 oopies of the pamphlet &quot;How to Manage an Allotment&quot;&quot; were sent out.During the week the requisite supplies of pesters and leaflets were forwarded to the four Railway Companies who are continuing the distribution of leaflets through certain of their booking Offices.

A certain portion of the land lying below the Kelham Woods has been almost worthless in the past owing to its being covered with treeB, briars, thorns, and hedges, from 10 to 20 yards wide*   This region has boen left to the last to develop, but it has been dealt with during the last month with very good results.      Ahout 30 acres have been cleared and land that&apos;was . previously not worth 5/- per acre is now manured, ploughed, and left in good condition to take a crop.The sheep are doing well on grass with a liberal supply of swedes,   The ewe flock which consists partly of Linoolns and Oxfords and all being the first year*s crop-need extra food and care.   The grass is.not up to expectation and the ration has to be supplemented with roots and hay.   The rest of the livestock is also in good condition.i11s,.

The monthly Crop Report showed that work in the fields was much hindered during January, and the situation was hack ward at the end of the month.    There is, owing to the progress of de-mobilisation, some improvement in the supply of labour on farms.The monthly report of fish landed in England and &quot;ales, showed that there was an inorease in January in the quantity as corn-pared with the same month last year, but a deorease in value.The work of finding Crop ^ep^quarters for new districts in connection with the collection of the agricultural returns proceeds steadily.Agricultural -ages Board .     Meetings of the &quot;Administration&quot;, &quot;Panning Costs and Cost of Living&quot;, and &quot;Customary Hours&quot; Committees were held on the 12th Fenruary, and a meeting of the &quot;Selection&quot; Committee on tho 13th February immediately prior to tho meeting of tho &quot;-&quot;ages Board on that day.At the meeting of the &quot;rages Board held on the 13th February, An the motion of ;.:r. Edwards, seconded by . ir. Overman, the Board unanimously resolved to place on record their high appreciation of tho *&quot;ork of Mr. Arch on behalf of the agricultural labourer, and to com-municate to ;.iir. Arch&apos;s family an expression of their respectful sympathy.A large number of letters were reported from Workers&apos; Organisations asking for an immediate increase in the minimum rates of wages fixed by the Board.
The Chairman presented a report from tho &quot;Administration&quot; Committee dealing with (a) questions raised with regard to Permits of Exemption, (hi questions raised as to the Spooial Classes Orders Of the Board, (o) proceedings taken for the enforcement of the Board&apos;s Otfders, and (d) action taken on complaints as to non-payment of the minimum rates.    The Board adopted suggestions made by the Committee for the guidance of District *&quot;ages Committees in connec- i tion with the granting of permits of Exemption.    It was reported that the first prosecution taken under the Act for non-payment of the minimum rates had been heard on the 10th February at Maidstono,; and that prosecutions were pending In a number of other oases.   The: report on action taken on complaints as to non-payment of the mini-mum rates showed that up to the 8th February, 1919, the sums of  827 had been paid to workers in arrears of wages as a result of action taken by the Inspectorate.Mr. Orwin stated that the Committee on &quot;Farming Costs and Cost of Living&quot; had met on the previous day and made further progress with their report, which it was hoped to complete on the 2flth Feb.  ,&quot; and then to oiroulate to all members of the Board.Mr, Bobbins presented a report from the Committee appointed at the last meeting of the Wages Board to go into the whole question of fixing rates on the basis of &quot;oustomary&quot; hours. The Committee had met and agreed on the general linos of a oommuni-cation which they proposed should be sent to all Distriot Wages Committees for whose areas speoial rates for speial olaoses of workers had been fixed on the basis of &quot;customary hours&quot;, and they hoped to submit the considered draft to the next meeting of the Board.The period for lodging objections to the Board1s Proposal dated the     10th January, to define as overtime employment all em-ployment in excess of 6\ hours on a Saturday, or on suoh other day (not being Sunday) in every week as may be agreed between the em-ployer and the worker, having expired, the Board considered the ob-objections which had been lodged and also the reports made on the proposal by the various District Wages Committees.    Considerable discussion took,place in regard to the position under the Proposal of the various classes of Stockmen for whom special rates had been fixed on the basis of customary hours.      It was eventually agreed to make an Order on the basis of the Froposal, with the addition of a provision that any time spent by Horsemen, Cowmen, Shepherds, Teammen and other classes of Stsckmen in connection with the feed-ing and cleaning of stock shall not rank as overtime employment in cases where it does not 30 rank under the Orders already in force. The Order, will come into operation on the 3rd Jarch.^ The Board decided to appoint a Drafting Committee con-si sting of one Appointed Member, two Representatives of Employers and two Representatives of r&apos;orkers for the purpose of considering and approving the Orders drafted on the basis of the Board&apos;s reso-lution with a view to ensuring that the Orders as drafted correctly expressed the intention of the Board.The second prosecution under Part IV of the Act was heard at Havant Police Court on the 1*1 th February.     Summonses had been issued against an employer in respect of the payment at leBa than the minimum rates of five of his workers.     Only two charges were heard r-n Friday, one in respect of the payment of a youth at less than the minimum rates, and ohe in respect of the non-payment of the same ynuth on Sunday.     The Bench decided, against the weight of evidence as we were advised by our Solicitor, that the employer did n-^t know and oould not with reasonable diligence have ascer-tainod the rates.     They dismissed the first case andawarded three
guineas costs-to the defendant;   in the eeoond case they decided by a majority not to oonvict, but ordered the defendant to pay the arrears of wages to the worker.    It has been decided to ask the Bench to state a oase for the opinion of the High Court,A third, prosecution down for hearing at Spping on the 14th February wa3, in the absence of the defendant and four of the wit-nesses, adjourned for a week.During the week 119 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received;   74 oases were sent to Inspectors for visit;   enquiries by correspondence were made in 219 cases;   and 42 cases were completed.    Reports were received from Inspectors in 31 cases.Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey Branch.The Board continue to receive many enquiries as to the proce dure in redemption under the Tithe Act, 1918,  -and requests for large numbers of forms of application.    Among the enquiries received was 1 one by the solicitors to the Duke of Portland, who is considering the question of redeeming tithe rentcharge amounting to  1,943 charged on his property in 15 parishes.    The requests for forms included one from the Somerset County Council for property in 130 parishes and one from a firm of Hertfordshire land agents who reported that they had instructions from a client to redeem the tithe rentcharge charged upon his property in 31 parishes .    The number of the applications for redemption actually lodged Was 18, the same as in the previous week.Many applicants report that they have diffioulty in obtain-ing from the tithe rentcharge collectors the particulars necessary for filling up their forms of application.    The required information can usually, however, be obtained elsewhere.    It is only natural that tifthe/rentcharge collectors should not look with favour upon redemption^ proceedings, the effect of which is to extinguish the rent-charge ,.upon the continued existence of which their business depends.As a result of th  issue of a Press Notice on the 12th inst. announcing the revision of the Board&apos;s Scale of Compensation for guidance in the enfranchisement of copyholds of inheritance, many applications have been received for copies of the Scale which have been duly supplied.Joint Committee of Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and Ministry of Food.Numerous resolutions have been received from Agricultural Associations and others in respect to questions of control, and de-control of agricultural produce, indicating contradictory opinions.The excessive slaughter of calves ^s causing anxiety and a memorandum is in preparation by the Committee for sending to specially selected representatives, in milk producing areas, asking their views on a proposal to establish distributing centres from which special transport arrangements could be mad&amp; to the rearing districts.The Stands on the Corn exchanges have been kept&apos; *&amp;?ticularly 1 busy during the week.&quot;Weekly Notes&quot; No. 29 has been issued. The general literature of the Committee has been much in\ demand.

There appears to be some doubt whether these premises can now be allocated to this Department.    Meanwhile, several Branches of the Board are without sufficient or suitable accommodation and the work of the Department is consequently very much hindered.The forestry Branch (now working under the Interim Forest Authority) will be moving this week from 1, Whitehall to Sunderland House, Curzon Street, Mayfair^ W.l.It is hoped that the ^omon&apos;s Branoh of the Pood Produotion Department will be moving to their new offices at Grosvenor Gardens on ah early day next week and that consequentialmovements of other sections may then be proceeded with.-It can only be repeated that these constant movements Of staff rendered necessary by the endeavour made to carry on urgent and important business under the most unfavourable conditions as re-gards office accommodation aro not likely to cease until the problem of oecnoentrating the staff of the Department in one building can seriously be taken in hand.As suggested in previous reports it is desirable that immediate steps   be taken for restoring to the Board Armament Building, whioh was specially built for this Department, but was diverted to tho use of $he Ministry of Munitions at the outbreak of war.
