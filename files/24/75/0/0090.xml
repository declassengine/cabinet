Mediterranean zone in certain eventualities. It is hoped however that Italy will desist from this proposal as thore is no military reason for tho &quot;landing and it is not required for putting farther pressure on Turkey, &quot;but only to ease the Italian political situation at homo* Such a stop might lead Greece to land at Sr.c*?na and Prance to occupy Cilicia, thus destroying the principle of a single military command in Asia Minor and possibly leading to Turkish reprisals and a renewal of hostilities.The Italian Government has notified that the German troops being repatriated from. Turkey and South Russia cannot proceed via Trieste or Genoa.   It is also impossible for them to land at Marseilles owing  to tho congestion there..
