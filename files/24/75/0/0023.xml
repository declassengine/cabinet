RETIRED PAY&apos;.,1.   &apos; THE MINISTER OE PENSIONS said that he wished to&apos; bring before the Committee the question of the supple-men t a ry separation allowances to men in the Armies of Occupation and. in the post-war Army.   A paper on this matter (paper No. 128) had been prepared, but had not yet been circulated to the Committee.   It was, however, urgent in that permanent new rates of pay might soon be settled for the , regular Army.   He proposed&apos; to bring this forward as early as possible.THE COMMITTEE decidedThat this matter should be considered at the next Meeting. &apos;2.     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a paper by the Minister of Pensions (paper No. 127) making proposals for a war bonus on officers1 and nurses&apos; pensions and on the alternative pensions of men.-THE MINISTER 017&apos; PENSIONS said that his predecessor ,,ln office had promised to bring forward proposals on this matter, and he was now carrying-out that promise. A big principle was involved, namely, was the government-ment prepared to rive a war bonus on officers1 pensions ?   He hi .self thought that as the House of Commons was constituted at present there was no doubt that great pressure would be exerted on the Government to grant a war bonus.   If that were decided upon, the next question was whether it should be assessed on retired pay which might oonsi3t partly of serrice pension and partly of disability pension or merely on the disability pension.   He understood that it was difficult to draw any line between these two in the case of a man who was drawing both,- and for -  -administrative purposes it woulc certainly be much simpler to give the war bonus on the &quot;hole of an officers1 retired pay.   Next, if it was decided that
all ranks were to be eligible for the bonus, would officers of -the&apos; hi $i&apos;er ranks be granted the game percentage increase?. In this connection, he pointed out that the main.&quot;purpose of any war bonus&apos;, was in order to enable the recipient to meet the increased ftost of living, and where higher ranks in the services were concerned, this consideration scarcely applied.   He therefore proposed certain money limits for war bonus and pension combined as set out in paragraph (e) of his memorandum.   lie proposed that this war bonus should hare.effect from January 1st 1919, up to Uaroh 31st, 1920, the fost being&apos;estimated at  807,000**THE -CHAIMAN pointed out that the war bonus on men&apos;s pensions (granted in December last was for the period Of six months only, namely./ up to June 3oth, 1919.THE MINISTER OF PENSIONS, continuing, pointed out that his Memorandum also contained a recommendation that the war &quot;bonus&apos; granted to men should also be extended to Mardh.31st 1920, but owin,s to difficulties of administration, the question of a further extension should be considered again not later than next JJovember.   Finally, when the question of a war bonus on men s pensions had been dealt with, alternative pensions were excluded on the ground that they were higher than the ordinary disability pension, and so the ar-mment as to the high cost of lifting did not apply to them.   He was now- aakin ; for a war bonus on the alternative pensions of officers, and if that- were conceded it was not possible to exclude the alternative pensions of the rank and file.   In reply to a question by the Chairman, he said that his proposals did not touch the ordinary service pensions which were administered&apos;by the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry, but oonly those which came under hie own Department.*THE CHAIRMAN said that he was In sympathy with the proposals of the Minister of pensions. He thought there were certain difficulties in the way. If a bonus of 20 per cent were given on officers disability pensions, he thought that the question would also be raised of a war bonus on service pensions which in bo many cases were very smal1*THE MINISTER   0? PENSIONS pointed out that in all the jcases which were included in his proposals there was an element of disablement which would presumably have a &apos; deleterious effect on a man&apos;s earning capacities.8th. CHARLES HAI&amp;I3 was of the opinion that this raised the whole question of a ^rar bonus on pensions of^very kind. At the end of th-e-scale there were purely disablement pensions;.at the-other end the purely service pensions; and between them were any number of grades, partly disability and partly service.   It was nor proposed to give a war bonus at every intermediate point of the scale but to stop abort at the purely service pension.   He doubted if this position could be maintained against pressure,   &apos; -Another/difficulty was that if.the&apos; war bonus was.given in cases arising from the present war,i ihere was no doubt that a cry would be raised for it to be extended to men who had been en^ged in former wars.   In their case, the argu* ment was even stronger, as they were older, in many&apos;cases, infirm, and less capable of earning a living   in addition,
it would raise the question of. a war bonus? on the civil pon-aiona of such Government servants as postmen, and others, He was not at all in favour of this scheme, especially as prices were now falling hut if on account of parliamentary pressure it became necessary to grant any war bonus, could the difficulty not be met without this very expensive method of granting a bonus to all and sundry?   If the work entailed in this was- too heavy to be done at headquarters, he thought perhaps some adaptation of the machinery of the Civil Liabilities Committee could be arranged to meet the difficulty,MR. BaLxJVvIW said that Treasury was very concerned over matters of, this kind, particularly as regards the question of giving war bonuses on the pensions of all men in the Civil Service,    The Chancellor of the Exchequer was continually receiving deputations whose demands, if conceded, mi jit cost the country millions of pounds.   These bonuses could only be paid by borrowing more money, at present a very dangerous procedure.   Another point was, that we should if possible avoid giving bonuses to men of the officer class at the present time, when labour was putting forward such excessive demands for higher wages.TIE iniJISTEH OP PENSIONS snid thst if any kind of differs ential treatment was introduced, as suggested by Sir Charles Karris, the administrative difficulties would be so great that the headquarters staff of the Ministry of Pensions would not be able to undertake the work.    It might be possible to do it through the Special Grants Committee, or through the Civil Liabilities Commission, although it would be introducing a novel element into the latter scheme.   In any- oa*ef he thought differ-ential treatment was objectionable, a? anything of the kind savoured of a charity grant.   As regards the possibility of having to extend war bonus to all.Government service pensions, he thought it could be quite easily argued that the men of the armed forces were quite apart from other Government servants, In any casej there w; s the element of disability in all cases&apos; which he proposed to include, and there was a quite definite line of distinction between wound pensions and those of people like postmen and dockyard workers!   the matter was one of extreme urgency, and he must press for a decision.TliE CO&quot;!. IT TEE failed to reach a decision on this matter, ana it was decided:-To refer it to the War Cabinet immediately.SIR CHARLES HARRIS desired to place on record his pro-test against the manner in which   most important matters of policy in regard to pay and pensions of the armed forces, involving sometimes millions of pounds, are dealt with by the Committee at. such short notice that no time time is allowed for the drafting of a Report which members of the Committee can either sign or dissent from.   He felt that the War Cabinet did not under these conditions get the full value of the Committees servi ces,,3.       THE I I1TISTER 0? PENSIONS raised the question of the pay of invalided officers while undergoing sanatorium treatment, Ke pointed out that any private undergoing treatment received pension at the full rate, and his wife and family received their separation and other allowances, the only deductions being l/- a day maintenance allowance during treatment.   An invalided officer, on the other hand, had 4/6d a day for treatment deducted from his pension, and received no children&apos;d allowance. &apos; We thus had a condition of things in which a priv-ate undergoing treatment received  l:l^B a week, a sergeant-major received something over  3 a week, while an officer
obtained only  l;15:9d a weak for the upkeep of hi a home and family. In order to make the position fairer, he desired to extend children&apos;s allowances to officers undergoing treatment.THE COiudlTTEE decidedThat this was a question to be settled between the Ministry of Pensions and the Traasury.2, Whitehall Gardens, g.W.1. 13th February, 1919.
