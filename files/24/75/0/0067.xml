0149/6320.War Cabinet.. Supplies for General Denikin1s Force. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War*In view of the discussions which have taken place in Paris, I propose to allow the supplies and stores, including the 100 aeroplanes (of which we have an enormous surplus in this country) to proceed as arranged to General Denikin&apos;s array, unless the War Cabinet desire that the matter should be again brought before them.Attention is drawn to the important success recently gained by General Deniki^s Army which makes &amp;t urgent to give him the supplies he has been led to expect,21st February, 1919.Winston S. Churchill.
