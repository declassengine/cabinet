/z -SEC RET.. 12Copy Ho79/789.16th February, 1919.^brandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,. DISBaNDMENT OF THE 6th BRIGADE ROYAL AIR FORCE,The Air Ministry in a letter No.8689/D.F.O, dated 4th February, 1919, (Appendix a), ask the Army Council to agree to the disbandment of the 6th Brigade Royal Air Force, from which are found the Air Forces for the defence of Great Britain against aircraft attack,     The reasons given for this proposal are : -(a) The serious shortage of personnel consequent on the demands of demobilisation,(b) The changed conditions with regard to the possibility of attack on England by hostile aircraft.2,     For the same reasons the Air Ministry propose to disband the7th Balloon ifi/ing Royal Air Force, which provides the BalloonAprons for the protection of London,3,     Under the scheme proposed by the Air Ministry, the number of squadrons will be reduced to 10, and will be located, in accordance with the requirements of administration, but with no regard to defence considerations.Should the proposals be agreed to, the Air Ministry propose to formulate a scheme whereby, in the case of necessity, these squadrons may be immediately brought together again, in order to operate under one command,4,     It must, however, be accepted that the first essential of any system of Air Defence is the power to be ready for action at short notice; consequently the scheme suggested by the Air Min-Istry will, in effect, mean that the Air Defence of Great britain is/
992eis temporarily abandoned;   this is clearly pointed out by tho General Officer Commanding^in^Ohief$ Great Britain, in his letter No. 14443/2. (A,. A.) dated 11th February, 1919 (Appendix B),5a     Tho War Cabinet are asked to decide whether the risk of attack by air nay now be neglected, in order to give effect to the administrative measures required by demobilisation.If it is decidedrthat the risk can be taken, it is reconstruction-x.ed that, in doing away with the 7th Balloon Wing and the 6th Brigade Royal Air Force, the existing aorodr-omes and alab-orate communications built up theraon should not bo dismantled., as they will probably be required for the after-war scheme.General Staff,War Office, 16th February, 1919(Sd.)

AIR MINISTRY,mStrand, V/.C.2,4th February 1919.Subjeot:-   Disbandment of 6th Brigade,Sir,I am commanded by the Air Council to acquaint you, for the information of the Army Council, that in view of the very serious shortage of personnel, and of the changed conditions with regard to the. possibility of an attack on England by hostile aircraft, they consider that the 6th Brigade, Royal Air Force, as such should cease to exist..2. I am also to-say that they are of opinion thatthe number of squadrons allotted for Home Defence should be reduced to a total of 10, which should be allocated to Royal Air Force Areas, in accordance with the attached table.3. I am further commanded to state that, should theArmy Council agree to the suggestion of the Air Council, they will submit a scheme whereby in case of necessity these squadrons may be immediately brought together in order to operate again under one command.4. Finally, I am commanded to inform you that it isconsidered that the necessity for the maintenance of the 7th Balloon Wing no longer exists and, therefore, In view of the afore-mentioned shortage of personnel, should be completely disbanded.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(3d.)

102APPENDIX   B,of.No. 14443/2,(A,A.)General Headquarters, Great Britain, Horse Guards, London S.W.1.11th February 1919,ir,In reply to your letter Wo. 79/739 (M.0.4.) of the 7th instant, [ understand from the letter of the Air Ministry that it is proposed 0 abolish the 6th Brigade, R.A.F. and replace it by 10 Squadrons /hioh are to be located regardless of Home Defence considerations, /ith the promise cf regrouping them under one oommand in the event of their being required for protection against air raids.   I consider this proposal radically unsound,2,     I have already informed the Army Council In my memorandum orwarded under  2173 (A.A.) of the 13th December last what I consider should be the future organisation of the Anti-AIrcraft Defence of this country, and I adhere to tho views expressed therein.   In my opinion it will be necessary to maintain 16 Squadrons, R,A,F, (each of 24 first class fighting machines) namely 6 for the Northern Air Defences and 10 for the London Air Defence Area, and I hope the Army Council will therefore press for the retention of this number of Squadrons which should be located in their present aerodromes. 3*    As regards paragraph 4 of the Air ministry&apos;s letter, I cannot agree that &quot;the necessity for the maintenance of the 7th Balloon Wing no longer exists&quot;.     On the contrary, I am convinced that the Balloon Apron will be necessary in any future war and I asked in my above mentioned memorandum, for a &quot;cadre&quot; of the 7th Balloon Wing to be maintained in peace and consist of a Depot Apron with tho necessary personnel.     This in my opinion is the minimum that should be retained.The Secretary,WAR OFFICE.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.) W.R. Robertson,General,General Officer Commanding-in-Chief THE FORCES IN GREAT BRITAIN.
