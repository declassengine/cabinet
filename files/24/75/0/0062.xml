1. The Minutes of the 46th. Meeting were approved.

PROPOSED GRATUITIES                                                                            TEMPORARY NAVAL OFFICERS.

2. DR. MACNAMARA said that he wished to raise the question of gratuities to Temporary Naval Officers.   Temporary Officers in the Army were being given a gratuity of 124 days pay for the first year and 62 days pay for each succeeding year or part of a year. No provision had been made for giving Temporary Naval Officers a corresponding gratuity and much pressure was certain to be brought to bear when it was realised that they were receiving different treatment to the Army Officers. The Treasury&apos;s argument was that Naval Officers were receiving Prize money: but this was not really a convincing argument in so far as Naval Officers were only eligible for Prize money if they had been thirty months at sea. In any case the amount they would receive on this account would not compare at all favourably with the gratuity. The Admiralty had suggested a compromise viz. 100 days pay for the first year, and 50 days pay for each succeeding year or part of a year. The matter was made still more difficult by the fact that the men of the Naval Division would have to receive the Army rates, since it was not advisable to differentiate between them and the soldiers. Questions were sure to be asked in Parliament which it would not be easy to answer satisfactorily.

SIR A. GEDDES asked how the actual amount of gratuity to young men who had gone into the Navy compared with that of men of the same age who had gone into the Army. He enquired if it was not the case that the Naval pay was rather better than that given to the Army, so that if a gratuity of a 100 days pay were given in the Navy as compare with 124 days in the Army it would not necessarily mean that the total amounts of the gratuities would be in the ratio of 100 to 124.

Ho........
He suggested that perhaps the case might be met if the Naval gratuity was to be fixed at 110 days.

DR. MACNAMARA agreed and promised to go into the question with a view to seeing how many days pay would bring the total gratuity to Naval Officers up to the same amount as that given to Army Officers.

MR. WATERFIELD thought it was a pity to re-open the matter after it had been settled, but in this view Dr.Macnamara did not agree.

MR. BLAND raised the question of Prize money and the extent to which the War Cabinet had been informed as to the conditions under which it was given, but after a short discussion, Sir A. Geddes said that he did not think it was necessary or advisable to enter into a lengthy argument on the question of Prize money.

It was agreed:-

That Dr. Macnamara should consider the question of how many days pay would give to Naval Officers the same total gratuity as that given to Army Officers, and that he should submit proposals for the further consideration of the Committee.

GRATUITIES WARRANT OFFICERS  ? ? ? 

3. SIR A. GEDDES explained that the question of Gratuities to Warrant Officers, Petty Officers, N.C.O.&apos;s and Men of the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force had been before the War Cabinet at their Meeting of the 14th. February and that the War Cabinet had decided, that as Chairman of the Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Pay Committee, he (Sir E. Geddes) was to have full powers of decision.

DR. MACNAMARA said that the War Office had prepared a Memorandum, in the first instance, proposing a scheme. This paper was submitted to the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee and finally approved by the War Cabinet. As he had already pointed out, he was present at the Meeting when the scheme was approved, and he regretted that he had overlooked the point which was now at issue. The War Office argument was

that.....
that the monthly increments to the gratuities to those men who have been drawing service pension and pay concurrently, should be one half the increment granted to men who have not been drawing such pay and pension.   The Admiralty, on the other hand, took the view that since a man&apos;s pension has been earned by service, it should not be affected by, nor should it affect, any other payment the man might receive in respect of duties performed, and for these? reasons recommended that the men concerned should receive the full monthly increments to their War Gratuity.

It had been suggested that, since the gratuity for the first year was not to be halved, the fact of only giving half the monthly increment in succeeding years would not make a very great difference on the whole gratuity.   He did not agree with this view, as in some cases the gratuity for the first year only worked out at a small amount. The fundamental argument of the sailor was that his pension was for services already rendered, and the same line was taken by the men in the dockyards. Up to October 1st. 1917, men in the Navy who had completed their time but were kept on in the Service got no pension and were given a small addition in pay. This system had been tried for three years, and caused increasing irritation and agitation with the result that the Admiralty had eventually to give way. Every witness before Admiral Jerram&apos;s Committee, although the bulk of them were not pensioners, took the view that pension was for "services earned" and should not be taken into consideration, nor brought in as a make-weight in any way, in connection with remuneration for further services. If the Admiralty proposal to give the full increment to pensioners were agreed to, it would mean, in the case of the Navy, a total non-recurring expenditure of about £70,000.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS who had entered at this point said that the difficulty of the War Office was that the officer who

was....
was called up for service was in exactly the same position as the soldier pensioner. It had been decided that the retired officer was only to have the lower scale of increment, that is 31 days pay as compared with 62, and, in order to put the commissioned and non-commissioned ranks on the same basis, the War Office proposal was that the pensioner should only got half the full increment. If the full increment was given to the non-commissioned ranks questions would certainly be raised as regards treating the commissioned ranks in a like manner. The policy of the "Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee" had always been to treat, so far as practicable, both commissioned and non-commissioned ranks in the same way. Since the last meeting, he had taken up the question of the cost to the War Office if the full increment were to be given; it was calculated as a rough estimate that the amount to provide for the non-commissioned ranks would be £90,000 and that for the commissioned ranks £750,000.

DR. MACNAMARA suggested that the question of giving the full increment to the commissioned ranks was not before the Committee. He did not agree that the argument that officers and men should be treated on exactly the same lines was a very weighty one, since under existing conditions they received all sorts of differential treatment. The contention that both grades should be treated alike might be used as an argument for levelling down as well as levelling up.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS could recollect many instances of it having been used for levelling up, but he had never heard of it having been used for levelling down. He thought that there was no use in shutting our eyes to the fact that if the men got full increment, it would also be demanded for the officers.

SIR A. GEDDES said that everyone realised that that would probably be so. He presumed that the officers drawing pension were in almost all cases regular Army Officers on retired pay, and Sir Charles Harris agreed that this was the case.
MR. BLAND, suggested that this class of officer was, on the whole, the best off.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS said that the policy always adhered to by the "Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee" was not to attempt to enquire into the private means of the different classes concerned. He was concerned to see that the War Cabinet recognized that questions would be raised as regards a similar concession in the case of officers. If with that knowledge it decided to grant the full increment to the non-commissioned ranks, he had nothing more to say.

SIR A. GEDDES explained that the power of decision had been delegated to him.

MR. WATERFIELD said that, so far as he know, the view of the Treasury was that the Admiralty claim could not be resisted. It was well, however, that the Committee should realise the claims that might be put forward on behalf of the commissioned ranks. The position of the non-commissioned ranks was quite different to that of the commissioned ranks, since the retired officer had, relatively to the non-commissioned officer or man, a very much higher rate of pay. When all considerations were balanced he thought that the retired officer would now leave the service better off than when he came back to it.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS said that it was a mistake to think that retired officers were all men of means. This was by no means so; a very considerable number only drew a pension of £80 a year, and, although it might seem strange to say so, many of those who had taken this small pension had left the service because they were poor men and not because they had private means. The Committee were not to think for a moment that the average retired officer is a man of means, since he know of some cases where such officers had incredible difficulty in making both ends meet. While not wishing to advocate the claim of the recalled retired officer to more he would like to call attention to the fact that 31 days additional pay for each year of service.....
service, though fair in itself, would not be a big amount as compared with the gratuities which were being given to temporary officers. Those were, in his opinion, absurdly excessive, and many of these receiving them did not really want them.

MR. WATERFIELD suggested that if it were decided to give the full increment to the non-commissioned ranks, a rider should be added to the decision of the Committee pointing out that they fully expected a similar claim would be made on the part of the commissioned ranks, and further that in such an event they did not consider the same grounds existed for recommending an increase as in the case of the men.

SIR A. GEDDES said that he thought the case had been well put by the Treasury representative.

It was decided:-

That pensioners in the non-commissioned ranks should receive the full monthly increments, but that in so far as the commissioned ranks are concerned it is not desirable to make any change as the result of this decision.

CONTINUANCE OF SUPPLEMENTATION &amp; SEPARATION ALLOWANCES IN THE CASE OF THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION AND THE NEW STANDING.                                                                                4. The Committee had under consideration a Paper No. 128 by the Minister of Pensions on the question of the continuance of Supplementation and Separation Allowances in the case of the Army of Occupation, and the new Standing Army.

MR. HORE explained the position as regards the Ministry of Pensions and said that the first question was whether supplementation or other assistance should continue to be given to the Army of Occupation. Although the pay might be higher, there might possibly be some case for supplementation or other assistance, but this did not apply to the voluntary Standing Army.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS thought that no practical question arose. The men composing the Army of Occupation were compulsorily retained, and supplementation or other assistance must go on as before. As regards the men who were enlisting for the first time in the new Army the case was different, since they.......


they enlisted voluntarily and there was no question as to what they were to get.

DR. MACNAMARA suggested that there was a slight difference as regards the continuance of supplementation or other assistance to the Army of Occupation, since the amount would have to be based on a higher level of pay, and it was for the Ministry of Pensions to consider whether the rules should not be modified. He also thought that it was necessary to guard against being misled as regards not giving any supplementation to people who volunteered for service in the new Army. It would not do to take the line that supplementation should not be given to volunteers since most of the men now being treated in this manner were originally volunteers. He thought that the question of supplementation being given to the men of the new Standing Army was a very big one, and could not be dealt with until later.

MR. HORE said that from the point of view of the Ministry of Pensions, it was a matter on which an early decision was required.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS in reply to a question by Sir A. Geddes, said that no new terms had been fixed for men being re-enlisted and men were being re-engaged for service in India, etc. under the existing conditions.

SIR A. GEDDES said that what it really amounted to was that there were practically four categories of men to be considered viz.

(l) The men who were being demobilised.

(2) The men of the Army of Occupation.

(3) The transition men, that is the men who were being re-enlisted for the Standing Army.

(4) Now recruits for the Standing Army.

As regards the first two categories, in the case of the men who are being demobilised no question existed: and in the case of the men of the Army of Occupation it would appear that supplementation or other assistance would have to continue. The case of men being re-enlisted, or newly enlisted, for the Standing Army was however.....


however not so easy and required consideration. He would like to ask for how many years men were being allowed to re-engage.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS said up to 4 years. No prohibition was being made aginst their marrying and it was an understood thing that allowances would continue as before.

MR. HORE said that the Ministry of pensions took the view that supplementation or other assistance was not called for in the case of the Standing Army, and if this was decided the matter did not concern the Ministry of Pensions.

MR. WATERFIELD supported the argument that men who enlisted voluntarily should not be given supplementation or other assistance, in view of the fact that they were being treated so generously. As regards grants by the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee to which the Chairman had just referred he thought that the line taken by the Treasury would be not to review existing grants but to continue them unless a man asked for an increase, or unloss a new application were made for the first time after February 1st. when the bonus became payable, when the whole question of his allowances would have to be considered. A reasonable part of the bonus ought to be considered as available out of his emoluments towards meeting his family liabilities.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS did not agree with this view as regards the Armies of Occupation and said you could not take away with the left hand what you had given with the right! He submitted that the answer to the question as to whether supplementation or other assistance should be given to the Army of Occupation wan "Yes"; and as to w? Department should administer it the answer was "Ministry of Pensions".

SIR A. GEDDES said that the whole question of supplementation or other assistance to the new Standing Army should be put before the Committee. A Paper had been received from the Minister of Pensions that morning in this connection: there had not been time to circulate it and he proposed that it should be considered at the next Meeting of the Committee. There appeared to be no question that supplementation or other assistance...
assistance would have to be given to the Army of Occupation, and that the Ministry of Pensions was the Department to administer it.

MR. HORE said that as regards the Standing Army it would create an extremely difficult position if some men who were being kept on got supplementation or other assistance and others did not. It was not desirable to give any pledge for the future.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS agreed, and said that certainly no pledge should be given as to what conditions men would serve under for the next twenty years. It was quite clear, however, that men who had re-enlisted on the same terms as they were already serving must continue to receive supplementation or other assistance.

It was agreed:-

(a) That the principle of supplementation would have to continue in the case of men retained to form the Armies of Occupation.

(b) That the Ministry of Pensions should undertake the administration of supplementation.

(c) That it is probable that supplementation or other assistance will have to be given to men of the new Standing Army who are not raw recruits, but that the whole question of supplementation or other assistance to men of the new Standing Army should be discussed at the next Meeting of the Committee.
