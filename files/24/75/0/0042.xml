h[$      1    RELEASE OF SPIRITS FROM BONDFurther Memorardt?m by the Food   Controller.&apos; 1, Since my memorandum of the ^th February was written I have reoeived Information which makes it reasonably clear that whether a definite increase is permitted or whether the restrictions affectingthe clearance of spirits are wholly withdrawn   the additional amount delivered from bond for home consumption will not exceed 10$ to I understand, moreover, that if the authorisation is merely for a specific increase, effect cannot be given to it by the Customs authorities until the 1st April.2.       he situation to my mind calls for immediate relief. Thirty-seven questions have been asked in Parliament during the last fortnight concerning the short supply of spirits, and not only Departments of State but the King himself ts pestered with complaints against unnecessary Government restrictions.5.   If, as I believe, the additional amount of spirits placed on the market will be the same whether a definite increase is sanctioned or restrictions wholly removed as in the case of wines, I am clearly in favour of the latter alternative.   It would have immediate   effect now that illness is prevalent instead of postponing increased supplies until better weather sots in.      It, would, moreover, have the enormous advantage of relieving the Government from the imputation of causing annoyance and discomfort, and the public could thereafter fight out their grievances with the trade.4.   I suggest therefore, that the restrictions on the delivery of spirits from bond should be wholly withdrawn.G, H. ROBERTSMINISTRY OF FOOD, .February, 20.. 1919,
