[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government] CONFIDENTIAL. [February 7, 1919.] 6 %&apos;.Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office.Germany/034.n tb.lTHE GERMAN CONSTITUTION.PROFESSOR HUGO PREUSS, the German Secretary of State for the Interior, lias been employed for some time in drawing up a scheme for the Constitution of a new German Federated Empire,^ and has at last produced the draft of part of the scheme. This part deals (1) with the Empire and the German States; [2\ with the fundamental rights of the German people; (3) with the future Reichstag; and (4) with the President of the German Empire and with the Imperial Government. The draft is accompanied by a long introduction, explaining the faults(of the former Constitution of the Empire and the reasons for the arrangements which the author of the draft recommends.The draft has been submitted in Berlin to a conference of representatives of the Federated Governments, and with very important alterations, made at their instance, will be laid before the National Constituent Assembly, which is to meet at Weimar on the 6th February.The President of the Empire.Professor Preuss&apos;s scheme had proposed that the President of the German Empire or Republican Confederation should be elected directly by universal suffrage. He argued that, in order to give the President of a parliamentary democracy the advantages of the position which a constitutional monarch occupies where there is parliamentary government., he must not be elected by the Parliament, but by the people. Preuss characterises the French system, where the President is elected by a Congress of the two Chambers, as "spurious parliamentarism," whereas "true parliamentarism pre-supposes two supreme organs of the State essentially on an equal footing." Yet there need be, in Preuss&apos;s view, no real opposition between the two. "Parliamentary government constitutes the flexible link between them."Preuss further proposed that the President should appoint the Imperial Chancellor and the other members of the Imperial Ministry, who should nevertheless be parlia-mentary Ministers in the sense of being dependent upon the confidence of the parliamentary majority. The ministers were to be chosen by the President on the recommendation of the Chancellor. They need not necessarily be members of parliament it is understood that the Conference of Ministers of the Federal States has declared against this method, for the present at any rate, and that the National Assembly at Weimar will be invited both to elect a President of the German Republic, and to indicate the Ministers it desires to be installed in office. In Preuss&apos;s scheme the President of the Empire would be elected for seven years, and would be re-eligible. The Imperial Parliament. Professor Preuss&apos;s scheme would have set up a two-Chamber, system for the Empire : the Popular House and the House of States. The Popular House would consist of the representatives of the whole German people, elected like the present National Assembly, by universal suffrage. The House of States was to be composed* The "Deutsches Keich" (German Empire), a term used throughout the draft of the Constitution, is defined in Article 1 as follows: "The Herman Empire consists of the Slates which have hitherto been members of it; and also of the territories whose population by virtue of the right of self-determination desires to be received into the Empire and is so received by an Imperial Law. The word "Reich" does not convey, and is not intended to convey, the special meaning of the word *&apos; Imperial." which implies an Emperor at the head of the State. The last words in Article 1 are important in their potential application to German-Austria.
of representatives of each of the German States elected by their Strte parliamentary Assemblies. The House of States would have been a much smaller body than the Popular House, since it was contemplated that there should be only one representative for every million inhabitants. No single State was to elect; more than one-third of the Bouse of Suites-a provision which, like certain other and still more important parts of Preuss&apos;s scheme, was manifestly directed against the supremacy of Prussia. Stales with fewer than a million inhabitants were to combine for election purposes with neighbouring States in cases where the similarity of their economic interests permitted.The proposals regarding the House of States have bt&amp;n subjected to a good deal of newspaper criticism. It has been pointed.out that the. House of States would merely be a second popular representation, as it would be elected by bodies-the State Parliaments which themselves were the product of universal suffrage. It is also suggested that representatives elected by the Parliament of a State might on occasion find themselves in conflict with the Government of that State. In any case, they would not necessarily have any direct connection with, and would certainly have no direct dependence upon, the Governments of the States. There is no indication that they would take instructions or even advice from the State Governments.A Kind of Federal Council.In addition to the House of States Preuss, therefore, proposes that the Govern-ments of the States should have the right to .send representatives to the Imperial Government. These representatives would have the right to appear before the Popular Assembly, and to bring forward the views of their respective Governments. Moreover, in each of the Imperial Ministries &quot; Councils would be formed from these special representatives of the States, and their opinion would have to be asked before bills were laid before the Popular Assembly and before the administrative instructions requisite for giving effect to Imperial legislation were issued.It is evident that these councils would in effect come to discharge a good many of the functions of the former Federal Council. It is easy to imagine conflicts between them and the Popular Assembly on the one hand, and the House of States on. the other. The trend of opinion, nevertheless, seems to be that some substitute for the Federal Council is indispensable, and that it is to be found in a body representing the governments rather than the parliaments of the different States.Democratic Safeguards.Preuss&apos;s scheme contemplates a good many democratic safeguards. The Popular House and the House of States-which together are to be called the Reichstag or Imperial Diet are to be elected for a period of only three years. The Reichstag must bre convoked at least once every year. It must be convoked at any time when one-third of the members of either of its Houses demands its convocation. Neither House can be adjourned for more than one motuh without its own consent. The President of the Empire, who has the right to adjourn, close or dissolve the Reichstag, may not dissolve it twice on the same ground.A member of the Reichstag may not be arrested or brought to trial, without the consent of the House to which he belongs for any act committed during the period of the session, unless he is caught when committing the act or in the course of the following day. Proceedings against a member of the Reichstag must be suspended for the duration of the session on the demand of the House to which he belongs. Members of the Reichstag and this is a very important matter, have the right to refuse to give evidence regarding persons who have confided facts to them in their quality as I eputies, or regarding such facts.The Reichstag may propose a popular referendum with a view to deposing the President of the Empire before the end of his term of office. If the popular vote is against deposition, the President is regarded as elected for a fresh term of seven years.ft is proposed to institute a State Court for the German Empire, before which the Imperial President, the Imperial Chancellor, and the Imperial Ministers can be arraigned on the charge of having violated the Imperial Constitution or an Imperial Law.Changes in the Constitution can during the first five years after it is established be made only with the assent of two-thirds of those members of both houses who are
present at the sitting at which the change is voted upon. Two-thirds of the total membership forms on such occasions a quorum.After the new Constitution has been in force for five years, any alteration will be subject to a referendum.The object of this interval is to enable the Constitution to obtain a fair trial, and to obviate rash changes during the unsettled period which is bound to continue for some time after the war.On the other hand, Preuss&apos;s scheme &quot;expressly excludes a popular initiative by referendum such as exists in Switzerland. &quot; The right to propose laws belongs to the Popular House, the House of States, and the Imperial Government.&quot; It is pointed out that in Great States the popular initiative by referendum is not practicable. If a small number of citizens were permitted by the constitution to call for such a reference to the people, the result would be constant political disturbance. If a large number say one million were requisite for every such demand, an elaborate and costly procedure would each time he involved, and the referendum would thus lose its interest for the Vast majority and might even involve serious dangers for the public life of the nation.In cases where a difference of opinion arises between the Reichstag and the President of the Empire regarding a particular Bill, but where the whole policy of the country is not involved and a dissolution would consequently seem to be too drastic,an expedient, the President may consult the country on the point at issue by means of a referendum.It has been remarked in many of the German newspapers that the particular system of proportional representation which was adopted for the recent elections proved very unsatisfactory, and in many cases prevented the true opinion of the majority from finding expression at the polls. The draft contains no provisions on this head. The memorandum which accompanies it says that the Constitution must not be burdened with derails on this subject, but that a - proportional system is requisite in order to secure just representation. Special Imperial laws are contemplated to this end, and the experience of the elections for the National Assembly will be valuable.Partition of Prussia and Rearrangement of German Stale Boundaries.One of the most important &apos;and ablest parts of Prenss&apos;s introduction to his scheme is that in which he deals with the necessity for partitioning Prussia and readjusting the territorial extent of the different German States. The draft itself does not enter into concrete proposals.   It merely says in Article 11 : &quot;It is open to the German people, without regard for the territorial boundaries hitherto existing, to set up new Free States within the Empire, so far as the racial character of the population, the economic conditions and historical relationships suggest the formation of such States.&quot; The union of several member-States into a new Free State takes place by a State treaty between them, which requires the assent of the representative Assemblies and of the Imperial Government.&quot;And some further details follow as to the method of procedure.But Preuss devotes more than a third of his long introduction to a discussion-of the past and future position of Prussia and the other German States in the Empire. He shows how Bismarck constructed the constitution of the German Empire so as to give Prussia the position to which she was entitled by virtue of her population and territorial extent, her military strength, her economic resources and her cultural eminence, and how he at the same time.obviated a sense of injustice in the other States by various devices, including concessions to Bavarian particularism. Preuss is under no illusions as to the inevitable character of the continuance of Prussian predominance if Prussia remains as she is with forty millions out of the seventy millions of the population of the Empire.&quot; A single State which contains four-sevenths of the population of the whole . Empire is only possible as a State holding the hegemony.&quot;But Preuss thinks that it is impossible to set up the new German unity with Prussia at its head. For one thing, the National Assembly could&apos;never subsist in a satisfactory fashion side by side with another Assembly, the Prussian, which represented the vast majority of the nation.    In 184b, when the proportion of
population and power was not so adverse to Germany as it is at precent, the &quot; dualism &quot; between the National Assembly at Frankfurt and the Prussian National Assembly at Berlin wax one of the essential reasons why the attempt to establish a constitution for Germany tailed. Prenss thinks that &quot; little appears to have been learned in Germany from this experience.&quot;&apos; Yet it is certain, in his opinion, that a Prussian Assembly which represented the great majority of the German people would never be content to occupy a position which would be compatible with a successful constitutional settlement of the German Empire. He finds that the election of many State Assemblies before the German National Assembly is in itself an ominous: symptom, since, although ,the twenty-two German sovereigns and the faults of their Governments have been got rid of, the new democratic Governments may well display fresh weaknesses of their own. In the case of Prussia the evil will be worst. The problem, he says, cannot be thrust aside. It must be tackled. And he does not shrink from tackling it. Prussia, he asserts, is, like many of the other German States, the creation of arbitrary agencies, only it is a more glaringly artificial creation: &quot; The formation of the Prussian State shows precisely the same signs of dynastic policy as the other principalities of the confederation, only on a larger scale. Neither from the economic nor from the cultural point of view, nor from the [joint of view of racial connection, does the Prussian State form an organic whole. Portions of Germany of the most various character from these points of view have been forced together by a strong and successful policy of expansion conducted by the dynasty, its army, and its officials, and made into a rough-and-ready edifice as a substitute for the German State which was lacking. There is no occasion, after the present collapse, to depreciate the political services and the historical significance of this work of centuries. But it was and remained just a rough-and-ready edifice ; it was the German State, imperfect in every regard, the&apos;unaccomplished, and on those lines, the unaccomplishable unification of the German people.&quot;Preuss notes that the collapse of Prussia, its dynasty, and its army has promptly been followed by separatist movements within its borders. These movements were natural in view of the lack of homogeneity, but they were only directed against the artificial unity of Prussia. It is only the perfected unity of the new German Empire that can resolve the opposition of the agrarian east and the industrial west, which Prussia has failed to reconcile.Another objection to the present territorial disposition of Prussia is the way in&apos; which her territory is jammed in between some of the smaller German Slates, especially tho-;e of Thuringia, so as to thwart their natural tendency under the new conditions to form unions among themselves.The question of Berlin as the capital at once of Prussia and of the Empire is like-wise raised, if Berlin remains the capital of*Prussia, it will also be the centre of her inevitable efforts to retain the Prussian hegemony. Indeed, the cry of &quot;away from Berlin,&quot; which is being raised in so many places throughout Germany, really means, in Preuss&apos;s opinion, &quot; away from the united Prussian State.&quot;But it is not very desirable and it would not be easy in present circumstances to change the capital of the Empire. It would certainly be very costly, since the whole of the apparatus of government would have to be transferred and new buildings constructed. Industry and commerce would suffer grievously by the transference of the centre of administration, and so would the whole system of communications. Preuss&apos;s solution is that Berlin should cease to be the capital of Prussia, and should form with its suburbs and their immediate neighbourhood one of the new States into which Prussia could be divided. It would still be the capital of the Empire ; but, as a separate State, it would be immediately subordinated to the Empire and freed from.&apos; existing Prussian influences.The precise nature of the partition of Prussia which Preuss would propose was not set forth either in his draft of the Constitution or in the memorandum by which he accompanied it. But it was revealed in a paragraph in the &quot; Deutsche Allgemeine-Zeitung&quot; of l;()th January, 1919 (evening edition, p. 3). The proposal was to divide Prussia into eight republics, some of which were to be augmented by the addition of territory taken from other German States :I. The leading State in respect of numbers and wealth was, according to this proposal, to be the Pepublic of Greater Berlin, with a population of about ten millions ;
Further : 2. A Republic of Prussia embracing the provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia,.and the district of Bromberg; 3. A Republic of Silesia, embracing the province of Posen, the lands in the region of the Sucletes, and Eastern,Bohemia. ;     4. A Republic of Brandenburg (embracing the province of Brandenburg, but excluding those parts which belong to Greater Berlin), the province ofPomerania, with the Altmark and the two Mecklenburgs. 5. A  Republic  of  Lower Saxony, embracing Hanover, Schleswig-Holstein,Oldenburg, and Brunswick. 6. A Republic of Westphalia, embracing the province of Westphalia, the district of Schaumburg, the two Lippes and Pyrmont. &apos;..    7. A Republic of Hesse, embracing Hesse-Nassau and the Grand Duchy of Hesse. 8. A Republic of Rheinland, embracing the Rhine provinces, the BavarianPalatinate, and the principality of Birkenfeld.The Government district of Erfurt was to be detached and incorporated with the contemplated new German State of Great Thuringia.These proposals are on the lines recently sketched out by Herr -von Batocki, Chief Government President of Konigsberg, and referred to in Political Intelligence Department memorandum (Germany/029, of the 4th January, 1019). Preuss, like Batocki, lays stress upon the German dislike of excessive centralisation and the German attachment to local institutions and traditions. It is claimed for the scheme that it would &quot;dissolve Prussia into its natural elements.&quot;The scheme, in so. far as it concerns Prussia, is bound to excite much criticism. ]Jt was precisely the diversity of local interests and traditions which made the political life of Prussia in the second half of the 19th century a record of bitter and irreconcilable party feuds. Would the landowners and nobles of the provinces of East and West Prussia, it may be asked, be less aggressively reactionary if they are left to themselves in a little eastern republic ? The proposed Republic of Branden&apos;uirg, embracing the non-metropolitan districts of the old province of that name, as well as Pomerania, the Altmark, and the two Mecklenburgs, would likewise contain a powerful reactionary element. Together with the proposed Republic of Silesia, the new States might, in conceivable circumstances, associate themselves wdth the new Republic of Prussia in a fronde, or even in a separatist movement.The idea of constituting a metropolitan Republic of Greater Berlin doubtless proved attractive to the German professorial mind. City states in ancient Greece and mediasval Italy had often a brilliant, but generally a troubled and comparatively brief existence as real democracies. It does not seem probable that the Republic of Greater Berlin would prove an exception to the rule. On the contrary, it would be almost certainly pulled in a different political direction from the less progressive sister republics immediately surrounding it. It might easily become a field for daring experiments in political and social innovation.Another criticism, which has already been made in the German Press, is that the proposed partition of Prussia does not take sufficient account of the financial, industrial and general economic ties by which the different portions of the existing Prussia are connected, and which have been drawn very close by the prosperous development of the late Kingdom&apos; during the 43 years between the establishment of the German Empire and the outbreak of the great war.The fate of the proposal was sealed for the present, at any rate-by a step on the part of the Prussian Government, which in itself confirms Preuss&apos;s contention that Prussia will continue to exercise a preponderant influence in the new German Empire, and that the Imperial Government will not be able to act without Prussians support. The Prussian Government published on the 1st February the following declaration: &quot; We pointed out as far back as the 10th December, 1918, that the future political formation of Prussia will be determined by the Prussian Constituent Assembly, and that all attempts to wrench away portions of Prussia will be firmly opposed. The Prussian Government has maintained this position in its full extent in the recent discussions on the organisation of the German State. While we again bring these facts under general notice, we likewise again give expression to our expectation that the competent authorities will definitely oppose all . .   endeavours wrhich have a different tendency.&quot;
The result of the elections for the Prussian Constituent Assembly^ has made it plain that the Majority -Socialists will depend even more than in the German National Assembly upon the support of the Democrats [bourgeois Radicals). Many of these are interested in the maintenance of the economic unity of Prussia, and would therefore oppose its political partition. The Independent Socialists, who have their chief backing in the Prussian industrial centres, will alsh be against partition schemes. The Conservatives, although no longer in the commanding position which they occupied under the old regime and the old franchise, are stronger (48 out of 401) than had been expected. Their press rejects Prenss&apos;s scheme, and is peculiarly incensed at the proposed abolition of Prussian ascendancy in Germany. The &quot; Lokal-Anzeiger,&quot; the organ of the great industrialists, says that the draft exhibits the complete subordination of all historical,, political, and patriotic considerations to the dogmatic dictates of parliamentary democracy, and is so un-German and un-Prussian that it is bound to arouse the anger of all patriotic Germans, and to expose Germany to the ridicule of the world.The Decision of the Government.It is, perhaps, superfluous to deal at present with the other features of Preuss&apos;s scheme, as the German Government, the five Commissaries of the People, seem to have taken fright and to have hurriedly drawn up a provisional Constitutional Act which they will submit to the National Assembly at Weimer. The following are the provisions of that Act according to the German pressj : 1. The task of the German National Constitutional Assembly is to draft the future Federal Constitution, and to pass other urgent laws.2. The consent of the Committee of States (i.e., the new Federal Councils, the Conference of State Governments, which has been twice convoked in Berlin, once in December and again on 25th January, to discuss the Constitution) is necessary for the introduction of proposals by the Federal Government in the National Assembly.Each Free German State shall have at least one vote in that Committee. Large States are to have, as a rule, one vote for each million inhabitants But no State is to have more than one-third of all the votes. This works out so that the votes are distri-buted as follows : Prussia, 19 ; Bavaria, 7 ; Saxony, 5 ; Wiirtemberg and Baden, 3 each; Hesse and the remaining Federal States 1 vote each. The chairman of this Committee is to be a member of the Imperial Government.If German-Austria joins Germany, it is to be represented in the Council of States by a number of votes to be fixed by Federal Law. Uutil that time it will participate by an advisory vote.if no agreement is reached between the Federal Government and the Council of States, each party may submit its proposal to the National Assembly.3. Members of the Federal Government, and of the Flouse of States,J have the right to participate in the debates of the National Assembly, and to speak at any time in order to set forth the views of their respective Governments.4. The future Federal Constitution shall be voted by the National Assembly.The territorial possessions of the Free States cannot be changed without their consent.Federal laws are passed by agreement between the National Assembly and the Committee of States. If no agreement can be reached, the Federal President must obtain a decision by a referendum.5. Articles 21 to 23 and 26 to 32 of the present Constitution apply to the National Assembly   [These articles concerned procedure and privileges of members.]b. The Federal President has the charge of the affairs of the Federation in the sense of international law, and is to conclude treaties with foreign Powers in the name of the Federation, and to accredit and receive diplomatic envoys. The declaration of war, and the conclusion of peace are effected by a Federal law. As soon as the German Federation joins the League of Nations, which excludes secret treaties, all treaties with members of the League of Nations mast be approved by the National.

and the Committee of representatives of Free States. The President of the Confederation must promulgate all laws in the official Gazette.7. The National Assembly elects the President by an absolute majority. The President^ tenure of office lasts until the new President, elected according to the Federal Constitution, has assumed office.8 The Federal President appoints a Ministry for the administration of affairs. To this Government, all Federal authorities and the Supreme Command of the Army are subordinated. The Federal Ministers require &quot;the confidence of the National Assembly in order to retain office.9. All civil and military decisions and ordinances of the President must be countersigned by a Federal Minister.Federal Ministers are responsible to the National Assembly.The existing State Governments and the Constitution.At the date of writing (5th February), the text of the German press statements^ on which the foregoing information * regarding a provisional Constitutional Act is based, had not yet arrived in England. There is, however, an account of the first meeting of the conference of representatives from the different German State Governments, which was held on Saturday, 25th January. About 100 representatives attended.Preuss explained his scheme, and deplored its premature publication. The proposals for the partition of Prussia, he complained, had been made the subject of agitation at the election, and even the Democratic Party (bourgeois Radicals) had been intimidated by the attitude of the reactionaries. He objected to associating the idea of &quot; national pride &quot; with a single German State. The nation, he implied, was German, not Prussian.Hirsch, President of the Prussian Ministry, expressed the opinion that the proposed partition of Prussia was unduly unfavourable to that State, and unduly favourable to the South German States.Heine, speaking for Anhalt-Dessau, feared that the proposed partition of Prussia would divide the German people, and lead to arbitrary action which would damage the prospects of the constitution.The intervention of Eisner, the Bavarian Minister-President, showed how unpopular he is with other leaders of the revolution. What he proposed was that an Emergency Constitutional Act should be drawn up. It was, indeed a proposal of this nature which was in the end adopted, but the Conference took care that it should not seem to be adopted at EisneFs instance.The feeling of the Conference appeared to be, first, that the partition of Prussia would increase the number of small States in Germany, a change which would merely &quot;serve the ends of France&quot; ; and, secondly, that the compromise between Catholicism and Protestantism which was exhibited in Prussia would be sacrificed, since purely Catholic republics would be set up both in the east (Silesia) and in the west (Westphalia and the Rheinland). The debate revealed a considerable body of opinion among the delegates in favour of merging all the German States into one great republic, &quot; unitarianism,&quot; as the Germans call it. But there was general agreement that, if this consummation wrcre ever to be reached, it could only be by gradual development. State feeling was still too strong. Finally, the following resolution was adopted: 1. Under the presidency of the Secretary of State for the Interior (Preuss), a Commission (26th January), composed of one or more representatives of each of the separate States, will meet to-morrow (26th January) in order to discuss a provisional fundamental law wrhich shall be submitted to the National Assembly for its immediate decision. This fundamental law will be concerned solely with instituting a central authority, forming a a Ministry of the Empire, and securing the co-operation of the Govern-ments of the separate States in the work of the National Assembly.2. The Commission will be entrusted with the consideration of the present draft of a Constitution (Preuss&apos;s).3. The reports of the Commission will be submitted to the Imperial Government* iVIr. Robertsons despatch.
It is in all probability the recommendations of this commission that have been hurriedly adopted by the Imperial Government, as reported in The Hague despatch cited above. What is evidently desired is that a provisional form of a democratic constitution should be set up by the National Assembly with all speed, so thai Germany may appear before the Powers of the Paris Congress in a posture of readiness to negotiate for peace, and with a Government which the lowers can recognise as based upon the will of the German people.Fieri&apos;s Opinion.It is generally agreed that Ebert*, who at first was formally at the head of the Imperial Republican Government, and who still seems to be its moving spirit, is the shrewdest and most practical of the new German statesmen. He recently gave the press his views on the question of the Constitution, and ihey are sufficiently illuminating in an obscure situation to deserve to be reproduced in exienso. They sum up the situation on the eve of the meeting of the National Assembly at Weimar. Ebert saidt&quot; The main task of the National Assembly will be to determine the Constitu-tion of the Empire. That will be a difficult piece of work. For the remaking of the Empire will involve the demolition of a great deal which is entwined with the heart of the individual German on grounds of history and sentiment. We, more than any nation, are attached to what is traditional. Centuries of the system of small States have demonstrated this fact, as we know to our cost. But the revolu-tion would forfeit its most precious and most necessaiy results, if it did not clear away in the domain of the State things that have only subr-erved dynastic interests and which were, so to speak, preserved in the interest of the separate power of some Sovereign House. In the new German Republic, the only things peculiar to the different branches of tin; German people that ought to be preserved are those things which are of real value, but not any harmful particularism that would be perpetuated at the expense of the whole body politic. By.&apos; particularism,&apos; I mean in this sense both the selfish interests of a small Federal State and lust of domina-tion and of hegemony on the part of a Great State.&quot; &apos; Neither anarchy nor hegemony &apos; that must be the watchword of the new Germany. Secretary of State Preuss&apos;s draft of a Constitution-Preuss is well known as one of the leaders of the bourgeois democracy is a good piece of pieparatory work for helping to achieve this great object. Those who are now conducting the Government of the Empire are not yet committed to Preuss&apos;s scheme. They want first, to hear the views of the representatives of the Free States, now in conference, who have been making their criticisms upon it, and have thus been exhibiting the great interest in the Empire which animates ail its parts. The final decision must be left to the detailed consideration and the vote of the National Assembly.&quot; In Prussia, fault is being found with the draft because it is alleged to aim at breaking up great States into small ones ; while in South Germany the criticism is that it has far too centralising tendencies. The truth is that the scheme aims at a Federation of the Free States which would exclude any position of hegemony on the part of any single State. In the economic sphere, no doubt, the idea is to get as great unity as possible.. &apos;&apos;Our Conference of State Governments yesterday (25th January) showed that an arrangement with the Free States in this direction is quite practicable. The Envoy of German-Austria, Dr. Hartmann, expressed his approval of the main lines of the scheme for 1&apos;russia; but it is a well-known fact thai political arrange-nients can only be discussed when there is something in writing to wrork upon. Our friends in German-Austria are determined&apos;to put an end to an unnatural separation which has lasted a hundred years (sic) and, after having been so long under constraint through the right of dynasties to determine their destiny, they are resolved to obey henceforth no dictates save those of self-determination. We are not going to substitute one kind of constraint for another. On the contrary, we would accept in its fullest sense the principle laid down by Secretary of State Preuss :- &apos;The rearrangement of the territorial disposition of the Empire cannot simply be dictated from above.   The free self-determination of the populations* He has since (11th February) been elected President of the German Republic, j See &quot; Frankfurter Zeituug, &quot;January 26 (2nd morning edition).
must take the initiative in accordance with their economic and cultural necessities, while the Empire must only act by way of guidance, mediation, and finally, by giving its sanction.&apos;&quot;Ebert&apos;s declarations, by the way, reveal the important fact, which none of the reports disclosed, that the Austrian Minister, Dr. Hartmann, was present at the Conference of German State Government representatives, and that he gave his opinion on Preuss&apos;s draft of a constitution.o
W GERMAH COHSIMUTIOfl.5. The Provisional Constitution Bill was passed by the National Assembly at Weimar on the 10th February against a small minority composed of the IndependentSocialists and a few members of the Catholic Centre Party.A new Article was. introduced with regard to the States Committee.    That Committee is to admit only representatives of States whose Governments are formed on the basis if constitutionally elected Diets.It was further agreed that the National Assembly ia to retain the sele power to determine the ultimate form of the 3-erman Constitution, while for all other legislative measures the assent of the States Committeeis requisite.     (German Wireless, February 11, Serial!Tbis last provision assimilates the prerogativesHo. 8207).of the States Committee still more the former federal Council.
