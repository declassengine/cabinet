IK PR AH CIS.It may be worth while to draw attention   o French opinion which is in some resoects in an irritated and suspicious mood.    It is not merely a matter of reaction from the rejoicings of the Armistice or reaction from the exaggerated enthusiasms about President Wilson, which no statesman who ever existed could have lived up to.     For is it merely a.matter of particular sub ?ects Cf friction between France and her /-Hies, though these are by no means wanting.     It is partly the (result of a very slow &quot;awakening to realities on the part of Frenchmen, lor *erha ^s of the unwillingness or incapacity of F-&apos;eno* ^en to nerceive Irealifeies which are clear to all other eyes.     France, like Ireland, lis living on a double diet of memories:   remembered injuries and re-pembered glories;   the former always a very unwholesome (-iet;.&amp; the tatter even when; as in the case of France the glories are real, not flways a wholesome one.     France cannot forget Louis XIV or llaooleon pi it is very natural that she should not.     Uo country which h s rnce led the world will ever ferget it.     And no country which has gone through that experience will easily recognise that it belongs only to [he past and neither to the present nor to the future.     Throughout the tar ? ench orators and the French press have habitually exaggerated the fart played by France, and have concealed the decisive part played by for Allies, especially by England.     r.?his has been due not merely to &apos;&apos;&apos;T:t vanity which is the mast ancient characteristic of the French, ffld which made one of her greatest ooet? remark that &quot;la sotte vanite &apos;est nroorement le mal francais&quot;, but a noble reluctance to abandon [he greatest position in the world.     It is often the business of
-   V5-politicians raid r3most   lwoys of journalists to flatter the vanity and t e prejudices of those whom they address, end this process -&apos;as carried so far in France that only the exceptionally well-infered realised during the war that it had finally proved that France cou.lt; no longer stand alone in the world.     France had leaned on Russia since the Russian Alliance hut had eoncelaed it from herself as the Alliance was never put to the test and as France had always been in the position of the financial patron of Russia.     The war has shown her that re-liance on Russia was reliance on a broken reed, that she cannot stand alone and that her alliance with Great Britain is definitely an alli-ance of a weaker cower with a greater.     Only a few, no doubt, realise this, and perhaps no one realises that even in the military sphere the ultimate strength of the British Empire is decidedly greater than thai tfjf France, but all thinking Frenchmen &quot;mist realise that in the naval, finrncial and industrial spheres Great Britain is overwhelmingly strrnger than France either is or can ever hooo to be, and that, in fact, her position in the future depends u^on the protection of Great Britain,     At least there are only two alternatives for France outside that of alliance with Great Britain in which it would be always Great Britain which would be the predominating partner.     One is ruin, and the other is the establishment of r -League of Nations &quot;Men would really work.neither of these two alternatives to ruin can be welcome to an exceptionally proud neoole, especially one very innerfectly acuamnted with any part of the world except France.     They are too painful, in fact, to be openly mentioned and exist only as a source of irritation at the back of the minds of intelligent Frenchmen.    Probably no Frenchman Understands them better than P.01emenceau, whose genius has always lain largely in seeing facts,.and. his recognition oi   these facts may explain his co-operation with or at least acquiescence in the English and American -cheme cf * league of LI tions? &quot;dtir its
&apos;    .i , 296&apos; i iI II-o-- .andatory system, an attitude -hi oh rq.e scarcely expected of him even ,7 &apos;  - foreigners and still less by his. own countrymen.^erhaos by so doing he has still further irritated the i^ostientoe f Frenchmen less well-informed end less clear-sighted than himself, hey see the Conference spending its time for weeks unon abstract aestions like the League of Nations which, in their ignorance of the ecessities of France scarcely interests them at all, and of remote questions like those of the Pacific and of the African Colonies which npear to Frenchmen to be of very secondary importance.     &apos;-.nd they Dnder why lr.Clemencc-au who is the President of the Conference, whom bey know to be a strong man, and whom they expected somehow to make ranee lead the Conference, has allowed himself to be so much over-mdowed by President Wilson and l!r. Lloyd Ceorge.     Only a very few palise that on any point on which the United States and ^reat Britain jre really agreed and d. termined to Insist the other ^owers have no jlternative but acquiescence.But all this vague irritation is aggravated by a very real and Jressing sense that France has suffered far more during the war than ly of the Allies with the exception of Serbia and the doubtful ex-?otion of Belgium, and that she has therefore first claim to considera-Lon.     And it is not unnatural that Frenchmen should feel that; they lve said the price of their nearness to Germany to a degree vr- ich makes t absolutely necessary for them to have ;-ome protection more tangible Qd more instantly available thafl o League of Nations of which no one n tell whether it will nork until it has been tried and not found anting.     Consequently there was some irritation at the contrast he-Keen WDeschanel&apos;s soeech welcoming ^resicont wilson  to the Chamber he other day and the speech made by the &quot;Resident in reply.     ?Tr Uson seemed almost wholly to rely on the league of nations and on a hanged temper in the minds of the peoples, all of which not unnaturally Perns shadowy, remote, and unsubstantial to oeoole who five years age
ago saw the Germans over-run all Belgium, and the riche-gir^art- of France^ in a few weeks and had to wait, many &quot;months b-efe^e-British assistance could come on any considerable scale and three years before America so much as declared her readinesstr begin preoaring to come.This cannot be said to be an unreasonable attitude on their nart. But there is one thing w&apos; ich it is perhaps worth while pointing o it which is an unreasonable attitude.   The French are-constantly urging and have been doing so in the last few days that some system should be established by which theAllies s&quot;:ould pool the financial looses of the war so far as they are not re-paid by Germany.     How they cannot have it both ways.     If it is true that .hey are the oarty particularly interested in resisting German ambitions and particularly exposed to these dangers, it is clear the:.  J-ey cannot eomolain, even if it were true, which it is not, that England v&quot;as less ready to meet the Carman aggression than they were.   The British Navy was certainly at least as ready as the French Army.     Still less can they complain that the Americans , to whom the ^erm.&apos;:n danrer rTS non-existent at the beginning of the war and at least v ry remote at its end, should be exnected to be as ready &amp;o meet that danger as France who saw it staring in her face these last 40 years, cr even England, who saw it more or less clearly for the last 10.     If the danger is, as the French justly claim, Drimarily a French danger that iay aive the French a right to special ! territorial protection, but it obviously also lays upon them a special I obligation t.j meet it.     If their interest in defeating or resisting Germany is so much greater than that of England or America, it is ob-viously impossible that they should expect not to be called uoon to i bear the nrincicJ burden of resisting it.     It is obvious, then, that this claim far r financial pool of allied expenses is entirely unjustified-pfiable and that if anything is done to assist France, France must be required to admit that it is done as an act, not of justice but of generosity.
^-0iven these conditions^of &quot;s-ensi.ti ve&quot;pride^-mixedh,wrthjaruunea-sy^coiv sciou&amp;hess that if France is in the future to lead the world her leadership can only he intellectual net political, it is not surprising that occasions of friction occur at a moment like the present,   wounded pride drowns its misgivings as to its ewh strength by setting itself an extravagant programme tc accomplish.     The financial authorities oh France will h-ve the greatest difficulty during the next generation in meeting the liabilities to which the hjtate is already pledged.   ;*. Hihot, one of the highest authorities on such a question, has estimated that even if the state took in taxes 2/7 of the total income of the whole nation, an amount which he regards as the utmost possible, it&apos; still would not be able to meet its liabilities.     Hence the demands which he and others make for a big indemnity and for assistance from the Allies,     In his view, and that, for instance, of the Debits, it would not bp generosity byt &apos;strie?s justice&apos; that the Allies should pool at least their war debts as a common charge.     Yet the financial prospect does not prevent the Minister of IJarine from developing an extremely ambitious programme for a great Pavy and Mercantile Farine which even if they could be built could almost certainly not be manned. And territorial ambitions on the some scale are ooenly encouraged by journalists and less ooenly by   statesmen, without any regard to the fact ihat colonies and possessions &apos;require both men and money for their development and that France is not likely to have any superfluity of either for at least a generation.This temper and these programmes, especially the territorial ones, tend to cause friction:   and it is with England that both the temper, which is ^ne of not unnatural jealousy, and the programmes, most often come into conflict.     All thrrugh the war, and right up to the Armistice, the French, ignored so far as they could the work of the British Army and the fact that without the British navy the war would have been over at ence.     Here and there a few journalists like ILHerve. of the. Victoire made confessions of the injustice done to us and admitted that
i&quot;itho;it Knglend Prance would have been crushed in two or three months, 3ut the common attitude was either criticism of the army for being too svia 11 and not tailing a large enough part of the f,ont, or silence, kr at best&apos;a very grudging recognition,     Ho nation can like admitting chat it is dependent on another people and perhaos, ungenerous as it ia&apos;s,&quot; it was not ^ery surprising that very few Frenchmen were allowed to enow that it was the British armies &quot;ho played the chief part in the ast months of the war.     It is true that a few days before the .\rmis-:ice Marshal Foch said to a distinguished Englishman &apos;C&apos;est 1&apos;Angleterre sign a sauve la France&apos;..     But neither Foch, nor the statesmen, nor the iournalists told the public this rather unpleasant truth.     So also the surrender of the Herman navy was fcrrdly noticed in the pares s.       nd since the Armistice the Jealousy has shown itself in various ways, as n a perpetual insistance on what in itself deserves to be emphasised, he great losses, suffered by France and in particular the time it must ;ake before she can fully renew her industrial life.   To-day (Feb.15) here comes an official recognition by ;;eClemeneeau of the splendid iart played b&quot; the British Army in tVe task of what m.?y be called the irimary reconstruction of the devastated provinces.     But its generous anguage will come as a surprise to most Frenchmen, who have been mush lore inclined to think of English industry profiting by the German des-ruction to get a three:years start of Fiance.     So again our financial elp has been little recognised:&apos;   the far greater sacrifices madgr by he English taxpayer than by the French:   the amazing and almost absurd enerosity which paid rent for the land ; e occupief and defended, forement is made on the prosperity of English industry in supplying war fiterlals:   nCne is &apos;.. : ever mad-- on the prodigious sums poured into ranee by the daily expenditure of several millions cf foreign soldiers: r on the profits now being derived from the ?eae? Conference being eld in Paris.     So with regard to the future, it is insinuated, that England is plotting for disarmament on the land while she remains su-
preme at sea:   that she advocates the abo1 iti*,n of the submarine to make herself invulnerable and all-powerful;    that she neglected her duty in the main theatre of viar in order to forestall France in Asia and Africa.Too much must not be made ?f these symptoms ri&apos; ill-temper, though it may be fairly remarked that there has been an almost entire absence in the English press thr ughoat the war of similar, insinuations arainst France.     Criticisms were made privately of course, but in parliament and the Press everything French, army, people, even navy, was   distantly praised and never attacked.But however unreasonable this temper may be there it is and we have to deal with it,   Happily it do: s not. appear to&quot; have made itself serious-ly felt within the walls of the Peace Conference:   and the success of the conversations preliminary to the acceptance of the scheme for the League of   nations is an excellent augury fox the future.    -But&apos; the matters most likely to arouse French susceptibilities have not ryet been faced. The chief of these are;   the disposal of the &quot;mandate&quot; to be exercised over the German colonies in Africa:   the future of JAoroccd and Tangier; the future government of Asiatic Turkey-   tesettlement of the Balkans: the new frontiers of France and Germany and the political status of the district of the Left Bank of the Rhine.   On most of them there is nothing that need be said.     The future of Horecco does not directly concern the Conference,ond the Conference, having more than enough to do, may well leave it to he.negotiated between the &quot;powers concerned, that is&apos; France, Spain and Great Britain.     It is mown that France proposes to take advantage of the defeat of Germany to free herself in Heroceo from the restrictions imposed, by the Act of Algeciras, reserving only, - says the Temps - &quot;the principle of the open door&quot;.     If France does this Spain will claim to do the same;   so Count Romanones has announced. Prance also demands that Tangier should be under the Sultan of Morocco, that is under France, and tho present international system be abolished, Spain will of course resist this if she can and would orebably prefer
langier going to&apos; England if she cannot keo/i it herself.   The Temps in reference to the Treaties and to England makes, no -domand^.fer&quot;Unneocatien3f the Spanish zone, though French opinion makes   little concealment ofits desire ultimately to oust&apos; S&quot;-ain from &quot;orocco where&apos; by universal ad-evennission she has failed/ta keen order, and much more to develop the ountry.     Even her Prime Minister admits her failure in general terms, Jut this Horth African question may not arise at all at oresent;   and houg   the French have just grounds of complaint against Snain for allow-ng the Spanish zone to be used by the Germans during the war, and though hey may&quot;foment, as they did recently, &quot;agitations aimed at getting us ut of Gibraltar, they are net likely to carry their ambitions to the ioint of serious conflict with Great Britain.So with the resettlement of the Balkans.     Here it is a matter of (cmmeroial ambitions, especially at Salonica, of suspicion of Italy, and f the old French dream, new more absurd than-ever, of making the mediterranean a French Lake and reviving r,hat, in fact, never existed it is cal led by Frenchmen &quot;our Protectorate in the oast&quot;.     In the lalkans there is little or no opportunity for direct friction with Sng-and, as our policy is there, at any rate, v-holly disinterested, without jay selfish aims, or indeeo any aims at all except those of justice, pace and permanence.Nor need the disposal of the German colonies cause friction.     Though parly all the work of conquering them was dome by us - little as the ench public like to recognise it - we ire inclined to be very generous out then;   and even the French can scarcely grumble if, as seems fkely. they get the 1 i ?n&apos; s share of Cameroon and Togo land without nay-g - very large price for there either in fighting or inkconcessions ,English desires elsewhere.There regain the t&quot;0 really difficult questions-   the eastern f:on-\ms sf France, and the disposal of Asiatic Turkey.     Luckily here ain we are absolutely disinterested in the first of these .esceot .as
-4fthe frontier cf 1914 which gave France the whole cf the $aar galley andthe district of Landau.    A more important thing is that it is pretty&apos;f     ,    . retainclear that &quot;finder one form or another the French mean t6/control of thewhole L0ft .B&apos;ank of the Rhine,   it is true that IT.clemenceau has givendefinite assurances, confirming those given in July 1917 by !V0ambonto Mr. Balfour,that- France does not pro case annexation oi the Left Bank&apos;4&quot;except the Saar Valtey.    But he said that he regarded the Rhine as the natural frontier ar$.V Bulges ted that the Le:it Bank should be in a state of guaranteed neutrality.     The Foreign Office Commission of the Chamber was announced by its Chairman h\Franklin Bouillon, to havo been opposed to annexation      the Left Bank, &quot;hich indeed was not surgested by any of its members.     Sx^ept for tv-o Socialists, however, it unanimously demanded the annexation of the Saar.   The bulk $f*.the Socialists still remain faithful to thoir opposition to all annexations whether&apos;in, Europe or elsewhere and Gondenn not only the Syrian ambitious-vions of their ccuntrymen but also those which are aimed at the Rhine-land and even the Saar.     But they are a tiny minority on these subjects and it is certain that the French government will aim at getting all itbothcan.     So it is worth noticing that/the French armies oi occupation and the French journalists are very busy both in the collection of evidence of French sympathies in the &quot;bin el and and &quot;in Luxembourg and in placing themselves in a o&amp;sition to manipulate opinion in those countries and. sake French influence an established, f-ct which the Deace Conference Jsust recognise.    In Luxembourg for instance it is said that the French, fcent the ,elgians out&apos; on pretence that it -&quot;as to be the American zone oi occupation 3rtd then got in themselves and, sending Catholic regiments, used every effort to create a current ni desire for unity with ? anee a*&quot;ong the oeoole.trustees for the future&apos; peace of the world.     But there iswdoubtr that here as- elsewhere French appetites have-dangerously-increased since the i\mistife\.     Formerly nothing was publicly asked-for but the ,.lsace-% -V&quot;wt lit(Lorraine. %f 1870.     How aa official pronosal has been put forward for
&quot;bere :is ir need to blame them for acting so.   Our own military staff appears to admit th- t from a strategical point of vi-- w it is necessary for France to have at least some control.over Luxembourg;   and much therna ne may no doubt be said, of the &quot;Rhine provinces.     The only object of this memorandum is to point out that a vigorous propaganda is being car-ried eft in this direction;   and to give such instances of it as the language of the Tempo which has again and. again used such Phrases asi&apos;&quot;the raturn of France to the Rhine&quot; and spoken of the necessity of the Rhine be&apos;ng the military frontier whatever the political may be (Bsc.11) find (Jan. IP.) printed an article by General Malleterre, not claiming annexation,&apos; but insisting that the Rhine must be fixed as tho permanent frontier of Germany, and that without the Rhine Fr a nee can never be free from the danger of invasion.     For that reason, he argues, if and when the French Army of Occupation departs garrisons whould be left be-hind permanently to secure the Rhine.     And. in the Temps as elsewhere efforts are made to prove that eonsiderable French sympathies still linger in the Rhine countries and even in the palatinate, as indeed some German newspapers      have admitted.;  It is Plain that the Temps wh ch is generally in close touch with theFrench Government means French influence to be predominant on the LeftBank.   Less judicious pipers like the Gaulois (Dec.11) include thePalatinaee in their demands, and are iiiifce ready for its annexation.In all these matters we have no immediate or personal interest ex-cept the two great interests of European peace and justice.     From the^oint of view of peace Engli hmen are scarcely less anxious thanFrenchmen that France should be secure from attack.     But the problemit ascertaining what is needed for security and then of reconciling xxthese needs with the rival claims of justice and right :s interpretedby the speeches of President Vilsen in accordance with which the rllies&apos;.ave declared their readiness to frame the terms of peace, is one thesolution of which must be left to the Conference.    It ought not to be
. -11.insoluble: for it is no mere ohruse buttho simple truth to i?ay that a peace which leaves the French frontier insecure will promise but a short life to the Allied principles of justice and right;   and o e that ig-nores Justice will bo a poor guarantee of security.The other iifftoult question is that of Syria.   Here again practi-cally all Frenchmen except the Socialists insist that the whole of Syria must be made French and. that for that purpose the 1916 Agreement, whajch L^lchin and ILCambon continually declare to be binding on England, must be.admitted to be a )surd as involving a partition cf Syria and must therefore be torn .up in favour of France.     That is, apparently, the agreement is good against England but not against France.     The(&quot; truth however is that except for b rgaining purposes even the French are obliged to admit that t;e 1916 Agreement is dead.     They do not often allude to the later arrangement of Hov. 8, 1918, by which the t&quot;0 ^owcrs aggeed on -English suggestion to base th- settlement of these countries on the self-determination of the inhabitants.   But if t&quot; oy remember it they inv riably assume that the inhabitants of Syria prac-tically unanimously desire French protection,1    A great Tress campaign has gone on for some time with the object of getting this believed. This is directl ? contrary to the best information possessed by.-thefVBritish Government which indicated that the enthusiasm aroused by the joint declaration in Syria was largely due to the belief that it marked the end ts the claim t* a French Protectorate.     But French propaganda is clever and very persistent and it has succeeded in persuading some english correspondents in Paris to give some sort of accaptance to its statements as to Syrian desire for French assistance, and to give these statements a currency in the English press which will certainly be claimed by the French as giving English confirmation to their claims.In practice the whole problem of the settlement of Asiatic Turkey (fill have to be apprcached de novo and v/ill require very careful handling.     The French have ancient claims to a special -oslti:n in :
Syria, which however shadowy they ?ay appear to as, appear to them very substantial; and fortifies by religious, ?cational, strategic and above all commercial interests will certainly not be set aside without difficulty. Their jealousy snowed itself directly General Allenby began to advance in Palestine. All his successes were felt in Paris to be blows to French prestige almost as much as to Turkish power. And recently the claims of the King of the Hejaz, the arrival of his son Feizul in Paris to support those claims, and the favourable impression he has made on the Conference, have revived the controversy and led the Temps and many other papers to criticisms of Great Britain which are bitter in tone if not inactual words. In particular the cur? grievance is started that we alone and not the Allies generally, financed King Husein. No allusion of course is ever made to the fact that it is partly owing to this money and to Husein&apos;s soldiers that the French are now in Beyrout. Further difficulties have been caused by some action which the British Admiral has felt obliged to take on his own responsibility at Constantinople, as for instance the occupation of enemy banks by British troops. As usual the French want to have it both ways. Just as they appeal to self-determination to give them what was to have been the Russian share of Armenia and defy it if it gives us Syria and Palestine, so they use their occupation of the Rhine, which they certainly had no greater share in conquering than we, for the undisguised  prosecution of French econmmic and political aims and yet claim that in Asiatic Turkey, in the conquest of which they had hardly any share, they should play an equal part with the British representatives:

For the moment the storm must be recognised as rather a nasty one. But it will probably blow over. ?. Clemenceau gave a very cautious or ? recention to the French ?rians when they called upon him and he probably knows far better than the Cha?vinists how ready England is to meet all French claims which can be reconciled with justice and the princi? of the rights and desires if native peoples; and how vital it is ? France to face the future armed with the whole-hearted respect and ?ship of Great Britain and the United States.
