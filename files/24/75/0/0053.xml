Finland.has always been depend-ent on Russia for her food supplies and when once again normal conditions prevail tho inter-dependence between Russia and Finland will assume more than the old proportionsaPossibly the ordinary intercourse and commerce between two such friendly states might meet the exigencies of thisinter-dependence were it not for fact that Finland would get by far the best of the economic bargain and that russia would be placed at a great strategical disadvantage0     thus the Russians whom I have met feel dead against the independence of ^Finland and it is their opinion that Finland will eitherreturn to its allegiance to Russia, on account of the greatereconomic advantages it would thus secure,, or else, Russia willbe forced to attempt to coerce it either by economic boycottprobablyor by force of arms.     Thus future trouble would/result from the bare fact of Finland1s being declared an independent state,but if to this the handing over to Finland of Karelia is addwd,future and most likely immediate trouble will bo a certainty,When Russia recovers herself she will certainly endeavourto develop Murmansk harbour and thus Murmansk Railway willbecome an important commercial artery.     The eastern boundary of Karelia has never been do fined and in fact Russia deniesthat there is any separate district which can bo called Karelia,but it is certain that Finland will wish to claim territory which if it docs not include territory will certainly be veryadjacent/
adjacent to it.     It is easy to understand the strong objection to the frontier of an independent state ? either in close proximity tb-j or even including,., a railr ay of this nature cMoreover Finland would gain possession of the vast timber and mineral wealth lying vest of the railway fro?-Polyarni Krug to Segeja, and probably in addition the fishing industry on the oast coast of; the White Sea.     These material gains are evidently her aims, for *he claim that the Karelians are more exactly Finnish than Russian or at least the majority of them have leanings towards Finland; is ridiculous.     There a many districts scattered throughout Karelia whose inhabitants are purely Russian and in whose government no Karelian has a share.     Also more than half the native born farelians live outside Karelia in the area to the east and south-east of Petrograd.     Further, since 1809 the present frontier has existed and the history of the last 900 years is entirely contrary to the substantiation of any claim on Karelia by Finlando     As regards the immediate effect of ceding Karelia to Finland, when I said that I considered the position of the allies would be abhorrent I did not exaggerate.     Any such cession would undoubtedly be regarded as treacherous on our pa.t by Miller at Archangel, Yermolof, the Commander of Rissian fore here, and all loading Russian officers, and so far from receive the Russian support which, after months of labour I am at last beginning to receive, I should find every leading*Russian bitterly opposed to the transaction, and even those weuld refuse to ce-operate with us who are at present the most loyal to us.So strong is the feeling that to-day I was informed by the Commander of the Russian forces that if Karelia were given to the Finns he would devote his whole life to/ regaining It for Russia,,It would even be difficult for the League of Nations toprevent the conflict0     Moreover, when we withdraw, if theBolsheviks/
/Bolsheviks are to bo &quot;opposed successfully it is of utmost importance that the Karelians trained by me she/aid- be incorporated in the Russian Army and I am using every endeavour to ensure amicable working between Russians and Karelians o     It is probable,, in the event of Karelia being annexed by Finland that my Karelians would refuse to join tho Russians against Bolsheviks and set themselves the sole task of preventing the Finns from entering their country*     I consider far less mischief would bo done by ceding Peehenga to Finland, if any sop is required to be given them,     I must add, in order -to avoid giving a wrong impression that although I have discussed this question with the Russian authorities it has been entirely at their instigation,     They appear to be fully, aware of Finnish aspirationsl9     I have refrained from acquainting them of the fact that I am in possession of any official information on the matter,C,2 copies to M.I,lc,a0
