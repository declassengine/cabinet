This err-rr&quot;&quot;&quot;.     *N.o Property ofreL Hi?. Gril-government,Righte and Liabilities of Landlords and Tenants.^j^morandum by the President of the Local Government Board.The question of amending legislation relating to the rights of landlords ana tenants is exciting a good deal of public attention ana a number of questions on the subject have already appeared upon the order Book of the House of Commons.rioughly the demands fall under three heads -(l) For the continuance in some form or another of a restriction on the rents of small houses ouch as was imposed by the Increase of riant and mortgage Interest (War restrictions) Act, 1915.(2) For the extension of that Act and the amending statutes to houses of a higher rental than those to which that Act applies.(3) For other amendments in the interest of the tenants in the law relating to landlords and tenants.The Government have promised consideration of the question generally,     I ippenu for the convenience of the Committee a copy of a report received from a Committee of the Ministry of reconstruction which was set up to consider what should be the future of the Act of 1915 ana the Acts which have amended It.     The recommendations ox&quot; the-majority will be founa summarized on pages 14 and 15,The seoona point has not been specially enquired into but it is more or less common knowledge that there are man; cases in which the ten mts of houses above the rental limits of the Act of 1915 are being called upon either to purchase their houses or to quit.     This is no doubt a hardship but the restriction of the rl&amp;ht of an owner to sell his property seems to be a serious matter.On the third point 1  ippenu a copy of a Bill which was drafted for the ministry of reconstruct Ion list year dealing generally with the rel.initio.no of landlords and tenants and providing for the establishment of a bouy of judicial commissioners for the settlement of disputes.The v/hole subject U: difficult and controversial, It is also beset with many legal technicalities.     The Local Government Bo *ra are not concerned in the matter departmentally except in so far as their general interest in the question of the housing of the working classes gives them an interest in all questions with which houses are concerned,     Neither the Department nor local authorities have any duties or powers under the Act of 1915 ma it was more or less of an accident that that Act was introduced by wir. Long, while President of the Local Government board,I would therefore urge that legislation on these mitters relating to lmaloras ana tenants should not be undertaken by my Department.     As I have sale the subject is very technical ana any Bill on the subject, woula have to be in the hands of a trained lawyer.     The subject is foreign to the province of the Local Government Board ana under the recommendations of Lord Halaanefs Committee on the machinery
of Government it would seem to fail clearly within the functions which would be exerciseable by the minister of Justice.I suggest to the Home Affairs Committee that they should invite the Home Secretary to consider the question generally with or without the assistance of the Law Officers ana to report how i\ir legislation to deal with it can properly be undertaken.0, ADD13OH.Mil Government Board, Whitehall, rt.W.1.19th February, 1919.

Thomas, M.P., Mr. Will Thome, M.P., Mr. Thomas Richardson, M.P., a, others, but they were not able to attend.The Circumstances in which the Increase of Bent, &amp;c, Act was passed and its Provisions4.   Prior to the outbreak of war there was a growing shortage throughout the United Kingdom houses for the accommodation of the working classes.   The result was that rents showed a tendency to ris Under normal circumstances the effect of this would have been that capital would have been attracted building enterprise, new houses would have been built, and rents would have ceased to rise.   After til   J outbreak of war, however, building practically ceased.    Labour became scarce, the cost of buildii and the rate of interest on capital increased,  and the building of working-class houses was I longer a sufficiently profitable undertaking.   At the same time there was a large influx&apos;iof; munition work into many of the great industrial centres.   This resulted, towards the end of 1915, in an abnormally heal   ; demand in these centres for houses of small rental.   The situation thus created lent itself to the raisinge. rents and ultimately to the exaction of scarcity or monopoly rents.   Certain increases were made and otnais 1 intimated.  According to the report of Lord Hunter and Professor Scott (referred to in the footnote to para.lfTes in the Clyde district, where the feeling of discontent was most pronounced, few increase? in rent were discover c. to have been made up to November, 1915, which were not justified by the increased outgoings.   Nevertbeltiss ] strong feeling of discontent and irritation was shown among tenants, who seemed to consider that there mT^c no reason for any increase in the rents of houses which were already built before the increase in prices lJL^ commenced.   In some cases there was organised opposition to any increase in rent whatever. If,.5. There was general agreement that individual owners should not be permitted to take advantage M o] the exceptional circumstances to charge scarcity rents, and the Government, in December, 19.15, introducA m a Bill intended to prevent this. This was passed into law as the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Intenleie (War Eestrictions) Act, 1915. I6.   This Act (with its amendments referred to hereafter, where the context permits, as &quot; the Act &quot;I provided that the rents of all houses whose rent or rateable value did not exceed, in the case of houses in til Metropolitan Police Distinct,  35, in Scotland  30, and elsewhere  26, should not during the continuance Jqq the war, and for six months thereafter, be increased above the standard rent.   &quot; Standard rent &quot; was definA Q. for this purpose as the rent at which the house was let on 3rd August, 1914, or, if not let at that date, thfca the rent at which it was last let before that date, or, if first let after that date, then the rent at which it wH first let.  &quot;No tenant was to he ejected from such houses except for specified causes.   Further, no interest oKl any mortgage on any such house- was to be increased during the same period, nor was any such mortgajKi to he called in. IL,7. The Act of 1915 has been amended by the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act, 1917, ss. 4, 5, and 7, asp a by the Increase of Eent, &amp;c, Act, 1918. Briefly stated the effect of the amendments in the former ActiBy to permit rent or mortgage interest paid in excess of standard rates to be recovered, to prevent such exceT being entered in the rent book as arrears, to provide that the prohibition against taking any premium for til renewal of a tenancy shall not apply to a lease for a term of 2.1 years or upwards, and to make it clear thil in the case of a house let at a rent less than two-thirds of the rateable value the Act does not apply to til rent or tenancy, but that it should apply to such dwelling house as if no such tenancy existed. The lattJ Act deprives persons purchasing houses since the 30th September, 19.17, of the right to obtain possession I those houses for their own occupation or the occupation of persons in their employ or in the employ of soraBe^ tenant from them, except in the case of houses in regard to which a certificate is obtained from the Boardl Agriculture and Fisheries that they are required for persons engaged in agricultural work of urgent nation! importance.The Change in Circumstances.8. Since the passing of the Act in 1915 the cost of repairs has rapidly increased. The cost of manage ment generally, including insurance, has also increased. Under the Act no increase in rent can be made t( cover these extra outgoings. It is true that in many cases repairs have not been done (often because thf materials and labour were not obtainable), but it is a truism that postponed repairs eventually cost more, is also true that the owners&apos; losses from unlet houses and from bad debts have been reduced to a minimum On the whole, however, we have no doubt that owners have suffered hardship from the fact that while theii outgoings were steadily increasing their rents were kept stationary. The rate of interest on mortgage outside the scope of the Act and the market price of money have also greatly increased.The Position which will arise when the Act expires.ferem st erii1C.1c lie9. If the present Act is allowed to expire six months after the termination of the war, rents wi undoubtedly rise to a considerable extent. The increase demanded may, in many cases, be no more than i reasonable in view of the change in circumstances outlined above. However, with the great shortage o: houses which will exist, the opportunity to exact scarcity rents will be present. Further, this increase in rents will take place at a time of extreme dislocation, when demobilisation is proceeding, when a certain amount of unemployment may be present, and when (if only because of the reduction in overtime) the income; of wage earners may be lower.Incorporated Society of Law Agents in Scotland, the Faculty of Procurators in Glasgow, the Society of Advocates ii Aberdeen and the Faculty of Procurators and Solicitors in Dundee (Mr. J.

On the other hand the cost of building at the present time is enormously in excess of the pre-war cost, and, though this may soon begin to fall, it will be veiy high in the years immediately succeeding the ffar and is likely to he permanently higher than the pre-war cost. The rate of interest will also remain for 5ome time considerably higher than before the war. It will be unreasonable to expect that the number of douses needed will be provided on economic lines in competition with the existing houses, even when normal conditions return, if the rents of these are restricted to anything like their present level.i EVIDENCE  TAKEN.i   11.   We have endeavoured so far as possible to ascertain the views of all the different interests concerned.The Mortgagees (or Bondholders).12. The views of mortgagees have been expressed by the representatives of different Law Societies, who Lve devoted a good oeal of.their evidence to their case. Generally, of course, there is a desire that all jiestrictions on mortgages should be removed. The hardship of limiting the returns of one small class of Investor, who is frequently a man of small means, has been forcibly put. It has been generally stated that jiot only is he unable to-, obtain the return which other investors are getting, hut he actually suffers capital Ls if he wishes for any reason to obtain repayment of his money and has to transfer his mortgage. A large amount of trust money has been invested on mortgage because of -the preference of trustees for an investment Aich carried the right to repayment of the trust money in full at short notice without loss of trust funds. [With the determination of this right under the Act, trusts cannot be wound up except by a sacrifice of a portion of the trust money. At the same time, while the unfairness of continuing a restriction on the calling in of a limited class of mortgages was strongly emphasised, witnesses were prepared to admit that it might lie necessary to continue the restriction for a short period, and to agree to this provided a reasonable increase [sere permitted in the rate of interest.The Owners.13.   All the property owners emphasised the great increase in cost of repairs (which was put at from 100 per cent, to 200 per cent, according to the district) and in management generally (including insurance). Though repairs in many cases had not been done this was often due to the scarcity of labour and materials, and these repairs would have to be done eventually and would then cost more.   They admitted that the percentage of bad debts and &quot; empties &quot;. (or &quot; unlets &quot;) was very small, but they urged that nevertheless their list return was much less than in 1914, while, with the increased cost of living and high taxation, an increased [net return was necessary if they were to be put in anything like as good a position as in 1914.   They [illustrated this by showing that in oases where houses&apos;subject to the Act were occupied they could only be sold fat a considerable loss, by reason of the low return on the investment in relation to other investments.14. There was considerable variation as to exact figures, but the general effect-of the evidence was that,, [on the average, repairs amounted before the war to approximately 20 per cent, of the rental&apos; (exclusive of&apos; [rates), and that the cost of repairs at present might be taken to be considerably more than double the pre-war [cost and was likely to be approximately double for the next one or two years. Other costs of management [we also higher. A rise of some 20 per cent, on net rental would he required to cover these additional [outgoings. An increase of 1 per cent, on the net return to the owner upon his capital (allowing for an extra [lper cent, to mortgagees where, as in most cases, the property is mortgaged) would require an increase in^ [let rental of at least 15 per cent. To put owners in as good a position as in 1914 therefore, a 35 per cent, [kcrease in net rental should be permitted. Figures varied, but this is an approximate statement. A claim IBs made, and was generally regarded as fair by tenants, that owners should on a change of tenancy be [allowed to increase such rents as were in 1914, for some sentimental or other reason, substantially lower than [tie rents of similar adjoining houses. Finally it was urged that in some cases the level of rents in 1914 was [low, as they had not recovered from the slump resulting from over-building a few years previously, and that Jiibare justice was to be done to owners some higher level should be taken as the pre-war &quot; standard.&quot; More [Ian one witness from the Glasgow district stated that for the years 1906 to 1911 many owners were obtaining [little, if any, return upon their property and that even at the outbreak of war the average return was only [from 3ij to 4^ per cent. On the other hand Mr. Griffin representing the London Owners stated that as much [as8 per cent, net on weekly leasehold properties and 6 per cent, to 7 per cent, on weekly freehold properties pas being obtained in London before the war.15. The owners contended that if producers of houses were to be treated in the same way as other producers they should be allowed a reasonable return upon their capital; that it was unfair to restrict them [to pre-war prices when others were unrestricted, or at the most only restricted to a price based on present py costs. They therefore considered that in fairness the restrictions should be removed as soon as possible. [At the same time they were desirous of preventincr any owner charging a scarcity rent and realised that Pine control might be necessary for a period after the war. Indeed many of them considered that the effect M removing all restrictions would be that mortgages would be called in everywhere, forced sales would take&quot; [place and owners be ruined, this being the final result of the policy of restriction. They were, therefore, psirous that some restriction on mortgage interest and, as a consequence, on rents, should be continued for P short period. In any event, however, they all urged the absolute justice of their claim to a substantial [increase in rents over the present standard.j The Builders.I 16. In their capacity as owners the evidence of builders was similar to that of the owners given above, pey dealt, however, more particularly with the effect of restriction of rents on new building after the war. Rey pointed out that building by private enterprise depended upon the flow of capital into house property Investment, and this in its turn depended upon the return offered, in relation to other investments. Prior to Pe war an investor in house property expected a return of approximately 5 per cent, net, hut in view of the pieral rise in prices he would after the war expect a considerably greater return than under pre-war Kditions. No houses could be built in the years immediately succeeding the war without subsidies. But r view of the fact that the cost of building and rate of interest were likely to be pervianently higher than 21135 a *
before the war, it was not to be expected that houses could be built on economic lines at all even tinder pdst-^ normal conditions so long as the policy of restricting rents of existing houses was continued. A commercial rent could not be obtained on new houses in competition with similar existing houses built at a lower cod and restricted in rent. Private capital woiild therefore be attracted to other investments offering better and more secure prospects. Local Authorities themselves would equally find difficulty in obtaining a commercinl return.17. If housing was ever to return to an economic basis, rent restrictions should be removed as soon a; possible. Some of the builders realised that it might be dangerous to do this all at once, but they conside mat an immediate increase in rents should be permitted and that further increases should be allowed it stages.The Tenants.18. We had the advantage of the presence on the Committee of Mr. Dan Rider, the Hon. Secretary of the War Bents League, and he has been able to present to us the tenants&apos; point of view. We also examine! some witnesses suggested by him. We thought it well, however, to obtain the bulk of the evidence dealing with the tenants&apos; case from organised labour.19. The views expressed to us were very various. All were against restriction of rents being altog-ethci removed at the expiration of the. present Acts. All were in favour of the landlord being compensated for tit extra cost of repairs and other management expenses actually paid by him. All were agreed in principle that the good landlord should be justly treated.   There the unanimity broke down.20. Some of the trade union officials examined realised the great increase in cost, of repairs and tit fairness of giving an increased rate of interest to mortgagees, and agreed that all such reasonable increase is outgoings should be borne by the rent, which should be increased accordingly. They were prepared to agree that probably a 1 per cent, increase in mortgage interest and a 33 per cent, increase in rent would be requiitl if this were to be done. They thought, however, that a sudden and substantial increase in rents would men serious discontent and industrial unrest and that this increase might have to be made in two or more stagei, but they considered that, if the matter were properly put before them, tenants would realise that, with ai all round increase in the cost of everything else, rents must also rise. They were emphatic, however, that, while this increase in rent should be allowed to good landlords, no increase whatever should be allowei to owners of houses which did not come up to a proper minimum standard of habitability; and in particular to owners of slum houses which were only permitted to be inhabited because of the present famine of accoi modation. These witnesses considered that the Act should be extended for a period, with permitted increases in rent and mortgage interest. Opinions differed as to whether a general percentage of increase should It allowed or whether a decision of a Rent Court should be required in each case. They were almost unanimous, however, in claiming that some control over rents must be maintained as a permanent feature even afei the expiration of the extended period probably in the form of a Rent Court to which general appeal coul he made..21. The witnesses representing the War Emergency Workers National Committee, the Labour Housitf Association, and others, considered that restriction of rents should be continued until the shortage of house; was entirely made good. By &quot; shortage &quot; they meant, not the shortage caused by the war, nor the shortage in supply in relation to demand, but the number of houses necessary to replace all slums and to provide at least one room for every two of the population. They calculated that for this purpose one million houses and probably five million rooms should be provided in the next five years, and they considered that these houses should be built by the State and the Local Authorities in co-operation. They also considered that such financial assistance should be given by the State as to enable the new improved houses to be let at tie rent &quot; customary&quot; in the district before the war. For this purpose the Workers National Committee proposed that the State should provide subsidies, and the Labour Housing Association that the State shoull grant&quot; loans free of interest.&quot; When these new houses had been provided at pre-war rents, they were thea willing that existing houses should be allowed to compete freely in rents with the new houses. They were prepared to compensate the owners of existing houses for increased sums actually spent in repairs, and mortgagees for the handicap caused by their not being allowed to call in their mortgages, but according te some of-them this compensation was to be provided by the State (perhaps by an abatement in property tax), and not by an increase in rent. Mr. Webb considered, apart from other things, that to permit all owners to increase their rents in order to compensate some of them was an extravagant method. They were not prepared to countenance an increased return to either owner or mortgagee simply for the reason that other people were getting an increased return because of the war; nor because of the reduced value of money, unless everyone else with fixed incomes were to be similarly compensated. Thev expressed the view, with which we all agree, that the prime consideration to be insisted upon was that, in the national interests, fit and healthy housing should be provided for all. But some of them were of opinion that the provision of better housing should not involve any increase in existing or new rents, and emphasised the fact that any attempt to obtain such an increase would cause great political and industrial unrest.22. Councillor Andrew M&apos;Bride of the Glasgow Labour Party Housing Association expressed similar views except that he urged the provision of five-room and scullery houses in place of one or two-apartment houses and at no more, or even less, than the pre-war rents of the latter.23. The views of the representatives of the labourers on the Cottage Rents Committee of the Agricultural Wages Board were interesting. They considered the system of uneconomic rents, which is present in agricultural areas, undesirable and thought that wages should be fixed at such a figure as would enable the labourers to pay a commercial rent, and so to be independent of their employers in the matter of housing.GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.24. The problem upon which our advice is sought is an exceedingly difficult one. The policy adopted may determine whether housing is to continue on an economic basis, or whether it is to be permanent subsidised; and thus, in effect, to become a State enterprise.
Whether Restrictions should be Allowed to Lapse.25. We are unanimously of the opinion that it would be imprudent to remove all restrictions on rent af the expiration of the present Acts, six months after the termination of the war.* The Act was passed because the shortage of houses was such that owners were in a position, if they so determined, to charge a scarcity rent. There is now a far greater shortage of houses than at the date of the passing of the Act, and while this continues the risk of excessive or monopoly rents being charged is correspondingly greater. Many owners of houses would no doubt realise that it was against their own ultimate interests to demand advances in rent in excess of what might be required to recoup them for additional outgoings. Some owners, however, would not show such prudence, and the risk of having to meet heavy advances in rent due to scarcity of supply would cause great dissatisfaction and unrest among the tenants. This will be particularly so six months after the war, when there will be great uncertainty as to the future, when unemployment may possibly be present, and when demobilisation will be proceeding. We agree, too, with the view held by some of the representatives of owners, that there is a danger that, if the restrictions are suddenly removed, there may be a general calling up of mortgages affected by the Acts. We think, therefore, that, for the protection of both tenant and owner, restrictions on rent and on mortgage interest must be continued for a period.Hardship on Mortgagees and Owners.26. At the same time we are satisfied that the restrictions in their present form are inequitable both to mortgagees and owners.27. It is of the essence of an ordinary mortgage that it should be capable of being called in at short notice. The prospect of being able to obtain payment of the mortgage money in full at short notice is an inducement for accepting a lower rate of interest than would otherwise be demanded. If mortgagees of property under the Acts had, like other mortgagees, been able to call in their mortgages they would have been able to secure a considerably enhanced return, which would, to some extent, have compensated them for the increased cost of living. Further, most mortgages on property affected by the Act belong to people who are not wealthy. The wealthy find more remunerative investments. It must also be remembered that not only do the present restrictions prevent an increase in income, but they and the fear of their further continuance actually cause a decrease in capital value; because mortgages so restricted can only be transferred at a discount. We think it must be a condition of any extension of the period of the present legislation that ordinary mortgagees who, but for the Acts, would be entitled to call in their mortgages should be permitted to charge a rate of interest corresponding more nearly to the present rates charged on new mortgages.28. As regards owners, we think an increase in rent should be allowed to compensate them in part, at any rate, for increased mortgage interest and increased cost of repairs and other outgoings. Further, we do not think that any distinction can be drawn between mortgaged and unmortgaged houses. We have been informed that from T5 per cent, to 80 per cent, of the bouses under the Act are mortgaged, usually to the extent of approximately two-thirds of the value, and as regards the remainder of the cases we see no reason why an owner who is in effect his own mortgagee should not have equally good treatment.29. We have great difficulty in saying what actual increases in mortgage interest and in rent are equitable, but we are satisfied that the amounts of increase which we recommend should be permitted are substantially less than are sufficient to put mortgagees and owners into as good a position as in 1914.  -Restriction as a Permanent Policy.30. While we consider it would be unwise to remove all restrictions at the expiry of the present Acts, and that, subject to certain permitted increases, restrictions should be continued for a time, we do not think that this policy can with advantage be applied as a permanent measure to houses of small rental, and that the aim should be to return to economic conditions as soon as possible.31. According to the evidence before us the cost of building will in all probability be permanently higher after than it was before the war, even when normal conditions are reached. This, combined with the probable higher rate of interest and the attractiveness of other investments, will make the building of small houses a sufficiently difficult matter. If, in addition, rents continue to be restricted (even if the restriction is confined to houses built before the end of the war) private building enterprise will be further discouraged, if not destroyed. Capital will only be employed in building houses if there is a reasonable prospect that the return in the shape of rental will allow the owners, after payment of outgoings, a fair return upon their capital; and if restriction of rents is continued permanently this reasonable prospect will scarcely be present.32. Several of the bodies who favoured us with their views frankly admitted that they desired to see the abolition of private ownership in working class houses (except perhaps occupying-ownership), and all building&apos;undertaken by the State, or the Local Authorities aided by State subsidies. Jt is true that a great (leal of property provided by private enterprise in the past does not conform to proper standards, but it must be remembered that this is not necessarily due to the default of the owners. Suitable houses cannot be provided if working class tenants are not able and willing to pay an adequate rent, and the remedy for bad lousing may largely be found in ensuring the ability of the tenant to pay a fair rent. It is no doubt the business of the community to see that a proper standard of housing is maintained, but it does not therefore Necessarily follow that under ordinary circumstances the community should itself own all the houses. It fan equally protect the interests of the tenants by exercising a strict supervision over the character of the bouses erected and their maintenance in proper condition. We consider, however, that it would be unfortunate-ttate if houses, whether built by public or private enterprise, were to be permanently subsidised by the State. We recognise that during the abnormal conditions of the next few years subsidies&apos;will be required, but we jrould urge thai so soon as possible housing should be again established on an economic footing. This cannot &apos;ake place until restrictions on rent are finally removed.( The &quot; termination of the war &quot; has been defined as the date to be declared by Order in Council under the Termination of the resent War (Definition-) Apt, 1918, which Act states that the date to be so declared shall be, as nearly as may be, the date of tho  change or deposit of ratifications of the Treaty or Treaties of Peace.21135
RENT COURTS.36. It has been urged upon us h\ certain witnesses that the whole question of the rent to be charged any individual house should be determined by a Court; either an existing Court or one specially constitute! for the purpose. Some witnesses were in favour of Courts on the lines of Industrial Conciliation Boards with equal representation of tenants and owners and a neutral Chairman, but we are of opinion that a contribute so constituted would not be a satisfactory tribunal to determine Such questions as would arise. Other wit nesses suggested that the matter should be left to the County Courts37. No doubt, the ideal thing during the period of restriction would be to have every case separated; dealt with on its merits, but after careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that, apart from thi difficulty of the constitution of the Court, this would be impracticable. There are, perhaps, seven or eig million houses falling within the scope of the Acts; practically simultaneous decisions would be required ii an enormous number of cases and the work involved would he immense. Apart from this, it would h necessary to determine in each case what is a &quot;fair rent&quot; and different views would be held in differa* We think it important that steps should be taken to ensure that, when such an increase in rent is demanded, the reasonablene: of making the increase should be put before the tenant in simple terms. It might therefore be an advantage if a simple form o notice were set out in the amending Act or drawn up by the Central Housing Authority.t It has been very strongly urged on behalf of the tenants that any increases in rent to cover increased cost of repairs shoul only be permitted in cases where houses are kept in proper repair, and that in any event the owners of slum property should no benefit. We are all in sympathy with this view. On the other hand, owners of property examined by us expressed the view that tt powers already conferred upon Local Authorities, under the Public Health and other Acts affecting housing, were ample to affoi protection to the tenant. The difficulty is as to the form any safeguards of the kind should take. We have had several suggestion before us, but the one adopted received the more general approval. Two other alternatives were suggested. The first was that m further increase over the 10 % should be claimable until the owner had received an order of the County Court, based on th certificate of an architect appointed by it (the architect being practically in the same position as a Medical Referee under th Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts). The second was that no increase in rent should be claimable from one month after the service b; the Local Authority of any notice under the Public Health or Housing Acts requiring repairs or improvements to be done, until tb notice was carried out.Even the 10 % increase should be disallowed in the case of houses unfit for human habitation. $ When reference is made here and in other parts of the Report to the County Court, it is understood that in Scotland th application would be to the Sheriff Court.33. Until economic conditions are restored private enterprise, which has provided approximate] 95 per cent, of the houses in the past, cannot he expected to provide any substantial number of houses. At. in the case of houses built by the State or the Local Authorities it is equally desirable that an economic footing should be maintained; because if once the standard of an economic rent is departed from no stand remains, and greater and greater subsidies will be demanded with results that need not be elaborated, Incidentally, occupying-ownership, for which many of the Labour witnesses expressed sympathy, would ceii^The Period of Extension and Modifications.34. It is perfectly certain that for a considerable period after the war abnormal conditions will affee the building of houses and the rents that may be procured for existing houses. The war has lasted longer than was contemplated at the passing of the Act, and the shortage of houses has been greatly accentuate On the evidence submitted to us we are satisfied that the present cost of building houses is at least one lnmdn per cent, over the pre-war cost. This figure will no doubt gradually fall, and, after the lapse of a perioi what may be described as the normal post-war cost will be reached. It is impossible, however, to say w&quot; period will elapse before this condition of things is reached, or to what extent the cost of building will then exceed the pre-war cost or be less- than the present figure. Meantime many houses must be built and mi be subsidised. We think the restriction on rents should last until the shortage of houses caused by the war has been made good, and more or less normal conditions have been reached. It is impossible to forecast when this will be.   The situation will have to he reconsidered at a later date in the light of the actual facts.We therefore recommend that:  &apos;   The present Acts should be continued with modtifications for a period of three years from the ter nation of the war (that is to say, should be extended for a period of 2^ years).The following increases in mortgage interest and, in rent should (upon notice being given in an approved form*) be permitted to mortgagees and, owners of existing houses who, but for the statut restrictions, would, be otherwise free to demand, increases.Mortgagees should be entitled, in cases where the standard rate of interest, is less than 5 per cent to an increase-(a) at the end, of six months after the termination of the war of an amount not exceeding \ pa(b) at the end of another twelve months of a further amount not exceeding \ per cent but with a maximum of 5 per cent.mith a mammwm of f) per cent,Owners should be entitled, to increase their rent, at the end, of six months after the termination the war, by an amount not&apos; exceeding 10 per cent, of the rents exclusive of rates.At the expiration of another twelve months they should, be entitled, to increase their rents furtl by an amount not exceeding 15 per cent, of the present, rents exclusive of rates, upon obtaining certificate from the Local Authority to the effect that the house in respect of which the increase in m is contemplated is, at the time of the certificate, in reasonable tenantable repair and, condition A35.   We recognise that the proposal to permit increases in mortgage interest lip to a maximum of on 5 per cent, may be unfair to some mortgagees who by reason of the inferiority of their security are fair entitled to expect a higher rate of interest.   We have not, however, felt able to recommend any differentiatioi in their favour.   We recognise, too, that the granting of certificates by the Local Authorities as proposed us will mean increased work for their officials, and often the need for a larger staff.   Whatever proposal had adopted would, however, have meant inspection by somebody, and we think it best that this should done by the Local Authorities, upon whom lies, under the present law, the obligation for seeing that a pro standard of housing is maintained in a district. &apos; In cases where the present duties are being efficiently pet formed the extra work will not be great.   In other cases our proposal may act as a useful stimulus.
118districts. If rules were laid down as to what should he regarded as a fair rent it might amount to sub-stantially the same thing as fixing a percentage. Finally, both landlord and tenant would be involved in considerable expense. &quot; &apos;38. Although we cannot recommend that the question of the rents to be charged should in all cases be left to Rent Courts, yet we recognise that our recommendation in favour of fixed percentages of increase will be found to lead to various anomalies and that some of these might properly be dealt with by the decision of a Court. We are of opinion, therefore, that in certain exceptional circumstances applications to a County Court should be permitted to landlord or tenant. One of these cases is where the &quot;standard rent&quot; of houses is appreciably lower than the prevailing level of rents of similar houses in the neighbourhood; either, for example, because the tenant is one of long standing and the rent was fixed at a time of depression, or because the tenant is the widow of an old servant and generous terms were for this reason granted. It seems reasonable that, at any rate, on a change of tenancy, the &quot; standard rent&quot; should be increased to the prevailing level. Another case is where houses have since the passing of the Act been sub-let, partially let as unfurnished lodgings, or been used for the accommodation of boarders. Sub-letting of houses under the Act should be unlawful,* Where by reason of letting lodgings or taking in boarders the wear and tear on a house is substantially increased the owner should he entitled to an increased rent. Again, application for relief, complete or partial, from the suggested increases, might be allowed where houses have been let for the first time since the shortage of houses became acute and the standard rent is abnormally high in relation to similar houses in the district.   These matters might appropriately be dealt with in the County Courts.STATE SUBSIDY AS ALTERNATIVE TO INCREASED RENT.39. It was urged upon us by Mr. Sidney Webb and others that if it was deemed necessary to make extra payments to owners and mortgagees, these payments instead of being made by increased rents and mortgage interest, should be made by a subsidy from the State, for example, by an abatement from property tax. This suggestion would mean that housing would in this way&apos; become permanently uneconomic. Further, it would lead to innumerable other claims of a similar character in regard to other commodities than housing.   We have, therefore, not adopted this suggestion.AGRICULTURAL RENTS.40 The case of the agricultural cottage presents special difficulties. There, in the great majority of cases, the &quot;standard rent&quot; was uneconomic before the war. Cottages were let by the farmers to the labourers at rents of from Is. to 2s. Qd. per week, the cheap cottage being given in part payment of wages. Under the Corn Production Act, 19.1.7, an Agricultural Wages Board is established for the purpose of fixing minimum wages for agricultural workers in all districts. The Board have expressed themselves in favour of eventually fixing a wage sufficiently high to enable agricultural workers .to pay economic rents for their cottages. The Labour representatives on the Cottage Rents Committee of the Board, in their evidence before us, strongly supported this proposal. The Cottage Rents Committee reported that, taking a typical case, the economic rent of a good modern cottage built before the war would, under post-war conditions, *be some 7s. per week. Yet, in their Order of 6th September, 1918, it is laid down that, in calculating the benefits which may be reckoned as payment of wages in lieu of cash for the purpose of any minimum rate of wages, the maximum value of a labourers house shall be 3s.. per week. It is understood that the decision to fix this figure was based upon the fact that during the continuance of the present Increase of Rent, etc., Actsi the existing uneconomic rents could not be increased.41 In these circumstances, merely to permit rents of agricultural cottages to be increased by a per-centage on the &quot;standard rent&quot; will not bring rents appreciably nearer an economic (in the sense of a &quot; commercial &quot;) level. What is wanted is a new standard, fixed in regard to the complete change in the labourers economic condition.   As one method of achieving this, we recommend that: ......In the case of agricultural cottages, if in any district the standard rent, with the addition recom-mended by us, he less than the value for the time being fixed for a labourer&apos;.? cottage for the purposes, of calculating the benefits which may, he reckoned, as payment of wages in lieu.of cash in the case of any minimum rate of wages, under the Corn Production Act, 1917, then that value should be taken as the maximum rental for the time being under the Increase of Rent, etc., Acts.RATING.42. Views were expressed by both owners and tenants to the effect that the present rating system is inequitable, that it imposes an undue burden on the class of property falling within the Act, and exercises a prejudicial effect on new building. Several witnesses thought it would be preferable that a local income rate should be substituted for the present system. While noting these expressions of opinion, we do not feel in a position to deal with the rating question generally. Certain special points connected with rating arising out of the restrictive legislation which we are now considering may, however, be noticed.Equal Treatment foe Scottish Owners.43. A considerable part of the gross rent&apos;&quot;paid for houses of small rental consists, in general, of rates payable to Local Authorities. The rating system of Scotland differs from that of the remainder of the Kingdom, with the result that certain anomalies under the Act have arisen to which our attention has been drawn In the rest of the Kingdom rates are leviable in general upon occupiers. In Scotland&apos; they are leviable partly upon owners and partly upon occupiers. In the case of the smaller houses, however, the rates in all parts of the Kingdom are usually paid by the landlord who, in each case, recovers the rates in the rents obtained by him from his tenants. Under the Act of 1915 (Sec. 1 (1) (iv)) it is provided that &quot; when &quot; the landlord pays the rates chargeable on, or which but for the enactments relating to compounding would &quot; be chargeable on, the occupier &quot; rent may be increased to cover increased rates.   In virtue of this provision* It should be noted that it was only after security of tenure had been granted by the Act that sub-letting of houses of small rental without the consent of the landlord became practicable.21135 A 5
the landlord in other parts of the Kingdom may almost always recover any increase in rate, while in Scotland he can recover only that portion of rate which is leviable upon the occupier. &quot;We were informed that certain increases of owners&apos; rates had occurred in Scotland since the passing of the Act, without landlords having any right to recover this increase from the tenants. Whether rates are designated &quot; owner&apos;s &quot; or &quot; occu-pier&apos;s &quot; rates, they have to be met out of rents.   We recommend, therefore, that: In any continued control of rents by legislation owners of houses in the different parts of tliQ United Kingdom should be put on an equal footing as regards the right to increase rent to coven increases in rates.Various Anomalies&apos;.44. Complaints were made that under the provisions of the Act owners were not able to recover the full amount of the increase in rates. Owners of property in the Particle and Govan districts of Glasgow had a special grievance which may also be present elsewhere. The Act (Sec. 1 (1) (iv)) permits an increase in rent to a landlord who pays rates &quot; if the amount of the increase does not exceed any increase in the amount &quot; for the time being payable by the landlord in respect of such rates over the corresponding amount paid &apos;&apos;in respect of the yearly, half-yearly or other period which included the 3rd day of August, 1914.&quot; They pointed out that though &quot;the rating period in their district runs from Whit Sunday, the amount of the rates is not announced until September. Consequently, the &quot; standard rent &quot; on 3rd August, 1914, was based on the 1913-14 period, whilst under the wording of the Act, only increases in rates over the 1914-15 period could be claimed:  The difference in rates between 1913-14 and 1914-15 was thus permanently lost to them.We understand also that it has been decided that the provision of the Act permitting increases of rent to cover increases in rates does not apply to houses built after the commencement of the war. We think that these and any other similar anomalies should be dealt with.45. Eates in England and Wales and Ireland are levied upon the &quot; rateable value,&quot; which is a figure arrived at after deduction of an allowance for repairs and management. It was represented to us that, in arriving at the rateable value in England and Ireland, a more generous allowance should be made for repairs and management, upon grounds similar to those with which we deal in connection with assessment for income tax under Schedule A of the InCome Tax Acts. In view of the known complexity of the present rating system and the variation in practice in different districts, as we have not had expert evidence or the views of the rating authorities upon the point, we do not feel in a position to make any recommendation as to this. We would point out, however, that the granting of any such concession in the form suggested would only benefit English, Welsh and Irish owners; as in Scotland rates are levied on the &quot; rent &quot; as appearing in the valuation roll, and this figure is the actual rent (exclusive of rates) without any such deduction as is made for repairs in England.If, therefore, the suggestion is adopted some equivalent concession would require to be made to Scottish owners.Eetention of Present Rateable Values.46. The result of making the increases in rent which we recommend will be that the rateable value of the houses will be increased, and this in its turn will be likely to cause increases in rates and consequently further additions to rent to cover the increased rates. This will cause a good deal of extra friction, which we think might well be avoided during the extended period of restriction.   We therefore recommend that The &quot; rateable values &quot; of houses falling within the Acts should not be increased during the con* tinuance of the restrictions in consequence of the additions to rent which we recommend should be permitted.This recommendation would not, of course, preclude alterations of rateable value due to other causes.Compounding.47. In a previous paragraph of this Report we have referred to the fact that under compounding arrange-ments landlords pay directly to Local Authorities the rates leviable in respect of houses of small rental. In Scotland, compounding takes place compulsorily under the House Letting and Eating (Scotland) Act, 19.11, in respect of houses under certain rentals, the owner receiving a small consideration (not exceeding 2  per cent.) to cover the cost of collection, and having the right to recover from the rating authorities the amount of rates which he has not been able to recover from his tenants. In England and Wales the owner takes the risk of not recovering the rates, and in respect of this risk he receives an abatement of rate of from 15 per cent, upwards. In certain cases he undertakes or is required to pay rates irrespective of whether the premises are occupied or not and for this receives an increased abatement amounting in some cases to a total of more than 30 per cent. This allowance, in general, much more than recoups the owner for any loss he incurs. The effect, therefore, of the English compounding system is to rate preferentially houses to which com-pounding applies. If the recommendation made in the previous paragraph be adopted no difficulty will arise. But if that recommendation be not adopted, and if the increases which we recommend are (as they will often be) sufficient to raise the rents of houses, the owners of which receive a compounding allowance, to a rental above the present compounding limits, the effect will be that the preferential discount will be lost and the rates payable in respect of those houses will be disproportionately increased. This will mean either that the rent will be further increased or that the owner will receive a smaller net increase in rent than he would otherwise obtain.To prevent this we recommend that If the last recommendation be nat adopted, provision should, be made that the increases in rent allowed under our previous recommendations shoiild not alter the owner&apos;s liability- to pay rates or affect his right to payment of a compounding allowance.Eates on Houses Built after the War.48.   Eates in Scotland are levied on the actual rent (exclusive of rates).   In other parts of the Kingdom they are levied on the basis of the &quot; reasonable letting value &quot; of premises.   This value cannot, presumably,
in the case of houses falling within the Act, be higher than the maximum rent permitted for the time being by statute. Assuming, as we do, that no restriction is imposed on the rents of houses built hereafter, the rents of new houses, whether built by Local Authorities or private enterprise, are, for the reasons we have indicated, likely to be considerably higher than those of similar existing houses. As a result their rateable values will also in each case be higher, and they will, therefore, be called upon to pay a greater contribution in rates than similar existing houses enjoying the advantage of similar local services.We think that steps should be taken to see that new houses are put into as good a position as regards rating as similar existing houses. This will be particularly necessary if the suggestion in para. 44 be adopted. We have not had an opportunity of considering in detail the best method of. dealing with the matter. It might, however, he met by enacting that, at all events during the period of restriction, the rate-able values of houses built hereafter should be deemed to be the same as those of similar existing houses, after making due allowance for difference in age and condition.DEDUCTIONS FROM INCOME TAX UNDER SCHEDULE A.49. One very general cause of complaint of the owners was the inadequacy of the present allowance for repairs and management under Schedule A of the Income Tax Acts. The present allowance is one-sixth of the gross value. The general effect of the evidence was that even before the war repairs to the cheaper class of property absorbed up to 25 per cent, of the rental, and the amount now will be much greater. This iras not so important when the income tax was is. 2d. in the  , but at the present rates it is serious. It is true that repayment of tax can be claimed in respect of dwellings of a rental not exceeding  .12 where expenditure in excess of the abatement is proved to have been made, but the preparation of the necessary claim is a difficult and expensive matter. We think that a more generous allowance should be made than at present. It would probably involve a very great deal of labour to assess houses separately on the actual profits, even if the necessary figures could be obtained, ancl.it seems to us that the matter might be met liy allowing a greater deduction in respect of the cheaper houses. The figure suggested to us as fair is one-fourth or one-fifth^We recommend therefore that as the present deduction in respect of the cost of repairs and management for the purposes of\ income tax under schedule a appears to us to be inadequate, at any rate, in the case of small house property, a larger deduction should, be allowed, to owners of houses falling within the acts. some provision should, however, be -made to ensure that this larger allowance should not be obtained in cases where proper repairs have not been done.THE RIGHT OF A PURCHASER TO POSSESSION.50. Under the Act of 1915 a landlord was not prevented from obtaining an order for possession of his remises if he could prove that they were reasonably required by him for his own occupation, or for that of me person in his employ or in the employ of some tenant from him. The amending Act of 1918 provides, madly speaking, that for this purpose &quot; landlord &quot; shall not include a person who bad purchased since the :0th September, 1917 (except in certain circumstances, in the case of agricultural cottages).51.   Several witnesses representing the owners of houses stated that this Act of 1918 was passed chiefly !: o prevent persons who desired to remove from areas exposed to air raids from buying houses in what were awarded as safe districts and turning out occupying tenants.   They urged, therefore, that, with the comingI (peace, this provision was no longer necessary, and that, as it prevented any sale of houses affected by the let from being made except at a sacrifice, it should not be continued in any proiorigation of the present :- sgislation.52. Undoubtedly the exodus from the London Metropolitan area in consequence of air raids had a good j. leal to do with the passing of the Act. At the same time the purchase of houses was in some cases being I Bed in other than raid areas as a means of evading the Act, and it seems to us that some control of the sale ( if houses is a necessary corollorary to the restriction of rents. In its absence it would be a simple matter I ir a person desiring a house for occupation, and not being able to rent one, to purchase a house and pay the 1 rice in instalments; which might be little in excess of the rent the purchaser was otherwise prepared to pay. I hi this way tenants who are entitled to the protection of the Act might suffer serious hardship. On the other I and, several cases were brought to our notice where the hardship was on the side of the purchaser. There nil be many such cases in the near future, and, as we may hope that before long, with the shifting of I opulation and the building of new houses, alternative accommodation will become available, we consider I fere should be some means for dealing with them. We think this matter might be dealt with by the County Wrts.We therefore recommend that:  in cases where a person has purchased a dwelling house since the 30i/t september, 1917, and requires the premises for his own occupation, or for that of some person in his employ or in the employ iof some tenant from him, a county court judge shall have poicer, upon application being made to him, to make an order for possession if, after consideration of all the circumstances, including the presence or otherwise of suitable alternative accommodation, he shall consider it reasonable.HOUSES BUILT HEREAFTER.53. The present legislation applies to all houses, falling within the appropriate limits, whether built efore the war or not.   There are, however, really three separate classes of houses demanding, in our opinion,iI -parate treatment. There are, first, the great mass of houses built before the war, the standard rents of rljuch were fixed by economic processes before the war.   These are dealt with in our main recommendations.1 here are, secondly, a relatively small number of houses let for the first time after the shortage of houses, I msed by war conditions, had become acute, and therefore at high rents. Some of these houses were built I rfore the war, and the rents of such bouses may frequently represent an exceptionally high return upon the &quot;pital invested. Others have been built during the war at a heavy cost (though usually subsidised to a tain,exjent), and the rent will not constitute an excessive- return,   This second class of cases is covered
by our recommendation, that, where the standard rent is abnormally high, an application should lie to f Court to say that the whole or part of the general percentage of increase recommended should not be permitte. Thirdly, there remain for consideration the houses built hereafter.54. We do not think that any restriction whatever should &quot;be placed on the rents of these houses. ] will, we recognise, be impossible to obtain a commercial return for houses built in the year or two inim diately succeeding the war, and subsidies will have to be paid, but we should hope that a commercial retut would eventually be obtained on what is found to be the post-war normal cost of building. It appears tot desirable that subsidies should only be granted to meet the temporary abnormal conditions. If, however economic conditions are to be reached in regard to houses built in the future, their rents must be free 1 rise without restriction. Meantime, the competition of the overwhelming number of existing houses wit their restricted rents, should form a sufficient safeguard against any unreasonable demands for rent in regan to the new houses.We, therefore, recommend that The restrictions should not apply to houses built hereafter.55. As we have already said, it is impossible at present to forecast the cost of building when boitw&apos; conditions are reached, but it would appear almost certain that it will be very substantially higher than tli cost of building before the war. On this assumption it follows that, when the restrictions on rent are final removed, the tendency will be for the rents of houses built before the war to rise approximately to the levt of the commercial rents which it will be necessary to charge for post-war houses. We suggest, therefort that before the Act expires, consideration should be given to the question whether some steps should be take which would have the effect of permanently lowering the rents of post-war houses, so as to enable them \ be let on a commercial basis, at prices not materially higher than the proper post-war commercial rent of pi war houses. It has been suggested to us that this might be done by some system of differential rating, j scheme has been submitted to us under which post-war houses would be rated only on the site value, whit pre-war houses continue to be rated on the composite hereditament, all additions to rates being levied on sit values only. Consideration of this scheme does not appear to us to fall within the scope of our reference an we are not in a position to make any recommendation thereupon, but we suggest that tire proposal may \ worthy of investigation.MISCELLANEOUS.Information as to &quot; Standard Rent.&quot;56.   It has been represented to us that tenants who have taken houses since the 3rd August, 1914, as often ignorant of what the &quot; standard rent &quot; is and find difficulty in obtaining this information. We recommend that An owner should be required, under penalty, upon the request in writing of the tenant, to ]supp\ particulars in writing of the amount of the &quot; standard rent&quot; of any dwelling house within the Acts.More Summary Remedy for Ejectment.57. Representations were made to us in favour of a more summary method of ejectment in England ans Wales in cases where rent is in arrear or other breaches of the tenancy agreement are committed. In Scotland where the rent of houses affected by the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1911, is in arrear foi seven days, the owner can give the tenant 48 hours&apos; notice, and if he fails to quit can take immediate actioi in a summary court. This procedure is said to be more satisfactory and expeditious than that which prevail; in England and Wales. We think that, having regard to the privileges enjoyed by tenants at present, tin owner is fairly entitled to a summary remedy where the conditions of the tenancy are not observed, and w&apos; recommend that this matter should have consideration. .Costs.58. We think that in order to avoid unnecessary applications to the Court the unsuccessful party, whether owner or tenant, should in each case be required to pay the costs of both parties unless, in the opinion of tie Court, there is good reason to the contrary. Steps, however, should be taken to see that these costs are fixed on as moderate a scale as practicable.Penalty for Accepting &quot; Key-Money.&quot;59. We had evidence before us that, in many cases, bonuses are being offered and paid for the key ol a house. Advertisements appear in the press offering  2,  5 and sometimes  10 and more as &quot; key-money&apos; in this way. It appears that this money is usually received, not by the owner, but either by the sitting tenant or the owner&apos;s agent or both. The Act (Sec. 1 (2) ) forbids the receipt of any such sum and provides for its being recoverable in certain cases, but no provision is made for any penalty. Representation was made to us that a penalty should he imposed, and we are of opinion that this should be done on the lines of Sec. 5 (2) of the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act, 1917. We recognise that when restrictions are imposed upon economic laws, attempts will always be made to evade them, but so long as the restrictions are main-tained they should be made as effective as possible.Sundry Details.60. We have dealt with the present legislation mainly so far as questions of policy are involved. Certain matters of detail have been brought to our notice with which we do not propose to deal in this Report but which should have attention in any amending legislation. As an example of this, we may mention the need for a more precise definition of what is a &quot; shop &quot; and what is a &quot; dwelling-house &quot; within the meaning of the Act.
120* Mr. EDWD. M. GIBBS signs subject to the following reservations,I agree with the Report generally but with reservations, especially as to Clause 34, respecting the period of extension of the Act, the increase in rate of interest on mortgages and the increase in rent.In my opinion, the Act as amended should be for not more than one year, but renewable year by year with the &quot; Expiring Laws Continuance Acts &quot;; to permit of the very earliest adjustment whenever changed &quot;conditions arise, and return to freedom of contract as soon as normal conditions eventuate. The removal of unnecessary restrictions should not wait until the shortage of houses ceases, but it is most important that it should be made as soon as possible so as to encourage early renewal of investment in the housing of the people, whether by Local Authorities, Utility Societies or private enterprise.The Act was a war emergency measure and has restricted increase in mortgage interest and in rent, during a period when the cost of all other necessities of life have largely increased, and when wages have been simi-larly increased. The restrictions have been borne by the mortgagees and owners for the benefit of the tenants and for the good of the State. It is generally admitted that the time has arrived for some re-adjustment. The equity of re-adjustment, as it appears to me, is to continue to protect the tenant from any excessive rent due to scarcity of houses, until normal conditions return; but to allow rent to be increased sufficiently to provide a market rate of interest to owners out of which to pay an equivalent increase in mortgage interest. The State to subsidise the owner for extra cost of repairs due to the war. If the cost of the necessities of life, other than houses, decrease, as probably they will do before the expiration of the Act, six months after declaration of peace, then the tenants will be better able to pay an increase in rent. If there be unemployment or a lowering of wages, then any inability to pay arising therefrom is not&apos; a just reason why the owner and mortgagee should continue to suffer any xmdue restrictions. The houses are required for employees who are necessary for trade and other purposes, and employers should pay wages sufficient to provide for a suitable house at a reasonable rent. During the transition period, in the event of the employer not being able to pay sufficient wages, or in the event of unemployment, then the increase in rent due to war should be paid by the State, as part of the cost of war. The owners and mortgagees certainly should not be called upon to suffer any undue restriction for the benefit of employers, or for the relief of the State from its just burden.The extra cost of repairs to existing hotises is due to the same cause and is of the same nature as the tetra cost of building new houses. If it is right for the State to subsidise the latter as a war charge, as is ?generally admitted, it is right also to subsidise the former. By so doing the State would remove a serious &quot;one of contention between owners and tenants; the former holding that they should not be called upon to do tepairs at such extraordinary cost unless rents be increased proportionately; the latter objecting to any riseCONCLUSION.61. The recommendations which we have ventured to make as to the steps to be taken to remove difficulties iu the present circumstances are essentially of the nature Of a compromise, rendered necessary, as -e think, by the abnormal situation brought about by the great scarcity of houses and the rise in prices onsequent upon the war.They are open to many, though not all, of the criticisms to which the original Act was exposed. They ill satisfy the claims of neither tenants nor owners as these were presented to us. If, however, economic conditions are to be restored, as in our opinion they ought to be, tenants must realise that a general rise in rices involves a rise in rents. The rise in cost of repairs and building has been largely brought about by n advance in wages. The occupiers of houses affected by the Act ought to remember that, although under our proposals they may be called upon to pay somewhat higher rents, the owners will not,, even after the ucreases take place, be put into as good a position as they were in prior to the war. On the other hand, wners of houses should appreciate the danger of an abrupt return to economic conditions, the justification or which would not be generally acknowledged, and the consequent advisability of meeting an abnormal hiation by concessions.The final solution of the housing question, so far as the working classes are concerned, is that wages liould be sufficient to enable workers to pay economic (or &quot;commercial &quot;) rents for suitable houses. It is an nsound policy to subsidise all houses because some tenants are unable to pay an economic rent. Assistance liould be given to those only who, for good reasons, are unable to pay for proper housing, and it is in the interests of the State that the numbers of these should be reduced to a minimum.62.   We have recapitulated our principal recommendations below for convenience of reference.63. In conclusion, we desire to express our appreciation of the careful and efficient way in which the Secretary, Mr. William Wallace, has discharged his duties, and of the valuable assistance rendered by him to us throughout this inquiry.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,WILLIAM HUNTER, Chairman.W.

W. A. LINDSAY, M.P.Owing to my Parliamentary duties I was unfortunately prevented from hearing a great deal of the evidence given to the Committee, and therefore do not think it right to assent to or dissent from the recom-mendations contained in the Report.W. A. LINDSAY.SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MAJORITY.(1) The present Acts should he continued with modifications for a period of three years from the termination of the war (that is to say, should be extended for a period, of 2\ years).The following increases in mortgage interest and in rent should (upon notice being given in an approvel form) be permitted to mortgagees and owners of existing houses who, but for the statutory restrictions, would be otherwise free to demand them.Mortgagees should be entitled, in cases where the standard rate of interest is less than 5 per cent., to an increase (a) at the end of six months after the termination of the war, of an amount not exceeding \ per cent,.,and(b) at the end of another twelve months, of a further amourit not exceeding \ per cent., but with a maximum of 5 per cent.of rent due to such extra cost. The State subsidy might be paid on production of the bill of repairs, subject to authoritative determination of amount of extra cost due to war. It would encourage owners to do repaid forthwith and thoroughly. The increase in rent should be subject to repairs having been done as is provided in the Report at the end of Clause 34.Increase in rents of existing houses to a reasonable extent is also necessary, so as to approach somewhat the economic rents of houses to be erected, that is..if local authorities are to be encouraged to provide further houses, with little or no charge on the rates, at. a time when such large extra charges are due to cover increase of cost of other local services. The increase indents is also necessary if Utility Societies are to provide housing, except on a philanthropic basis; and if private enterprise is to be enabled to renew its great services to the State in housing the people. Increase to market rate of interest will be justice and nothing more to owners and mortgagees; but it will be definitely beneficial to the tenants by encouraging the largest increase in number of houses and obviating scarcity rents immediately and also on return to normal times.In fixing the increase to be permitted, it should be remembered, that, mortgagees obtained rates of interest differing according to proportionate amount of loan and nature of security and that owners obtained rents differing according to character and position of property, and that the arrangements were made before the war, when there was perfect freedom of contract. For the present and for the temporary transition period it will therefore be unreasonable for any of the parties to expect the State to consider and re-adjust any inequalities in such vohintary agreements. I submit that the equity will he in permitting proportionate increase in the amounts for each. I suggest 25 per cent, on mortgage interest, equivalent to a rise of froni say 4 to 5 per cent, interest, and I also suggest an equal 25 per.cent, on net rent, exclusive of repairs and rates, equivalent to a rise of from say 5 to 6  per cent, return for gross investment, plus the State subsidy for increased cost of repairs due to. war. It may be some years before the market rate of interest will -be substan tially reduced but the cost of repairs may be reduced much more quickly and the State subsidy should soon cease.   The re-adjustments, as before provided, would be year by year.I have further to submit that, under Clause 34, as it appears in the Committees Report, the increase recommended being in one case on rate of interest and in other on rent, the amount of percentages are not comparable, and it will be found by test cases that in most of them the mortgagee will be ensured an increase, but that the owner will receive less from increase in rent than he will pay for increase in mortgage and extra cost of repairs; he will during the period of three years be receiving less net income than he does under the existing Act. The Committee&apos;s suggestion of J per cent, on mortgage interest, and 10 per cent, on rent is misleading to the careless reader. The former will appear a mere trifle compared with the latter, whereas under the circumstances above shown it is the reverse in effect.In reference to Rating (Clause 42), I desire to draw attention to the relief, by reform of rating from the undue burden on the class of property falling within the Act, being sufficient to largely contribute to relief from the higher rents anticipated.I find no reference in the Report to the suggestion for house duty on houses of less annual value than  20, which are at present alone exempt from, the duty. The duty would produce many millions of pounds per annum for State assistance for housing and thereby help very considerably to avoid scarcity rents, to the benefit of tenants of existing houses as well as to tenants of houses to be erected.
121-   MINORITY REPORT.BY MESSRS. WILLIAM B. NEVILLE AND DAN RIDER.1. Whilst we are able to agree with many of the recommendations contained in the Report, we are not in agreement with those paragraphs (26-29 and part of 34) which deal with the position of the mortgagee and the suggestion that he should be permitted to charge an increased rate of interest equal to 1 per cent.&apos; per annum with a maximum of 5 per cent, per annum, the owner being allowed to recoup, himself for this and other charges by raising rents to an amount not exceeding 25 per cent, of the rent less rates.2. The owners have contended that they should be placed in as good a position as they were in 1914, but this is a very elastic suggestion. Evidence was tendered to the Committee that, during the war, rents lave been paid, on the whole, with greater regularity than at any previous period; losses from uniet houses lave been practically nil. The income of the owner has, therefore, been higher generally than the pre-war receipts, whilst the expenditure in many instances has, in our opinion, actually decreased. It is notorious that during the war repairs have been, for obvious reasons, neglected and, therefore, seeing that interest, paid to the mortgagee has not increased,&apos;it is difficult to believe that the owners&apos; net returns are not as good as they were immediately preceding the war. We regret that no certified Revenue Accounts showing the position of investors in house property were submitted to the Committee, nor has the Committee authorised any investigations by chartered accountants to determine&apos; the balance of income over expenditure that was current with house-owning companies and private&apos;investors in pre-war periods and during the war. Higher income tax has, of course, been payable, but this personal expenditure is not peculiar to the owners of house property.3. It is recognised that the mortgagee has been unable, by reason of the restrictions of the, Act, to tall in mortgages and subsequently invest in securities at a possible higher rate of interest; but this is a position in which many other investors in undertakings scarcely less beneficial and necessary to the community have been placed. On the other hand the mortgagee&apos;s security has been, to a certain extent, safeguarded. His interest has been regularly received; there has been no slump in property adversely affecting the security of the mortgage- in fact the reverse is the case and there is a reasonable expectation of the full return of the principal when the present restrictions are moved. In no other belligerent country have owners been treated so far as we have information better than in this country. A comparison of the position of the British and French owner in this respect shows a specially marked advantage to the former. The separation allowances and the special grants in respect to rent by the Civil Liabilities Commissioners have, in our opinion, largely assisted the regular payments of rent.4. The proposal to allow rents to rise so that there shall be an additional income to the mortgagee or ojmer equal to 1 per cent, will, if adopted, yield a large additional income to the mortgagee and/or owner, lo definite figures are ascertainable, but the amount can hardly be less than  15,000,000 per annum. In our Judgment there is, at present, no justification for proceeding to collect this sum from the tenants of small houses, and it should not be contemplated. No one knows what the actual post-war rate of interest, dependent as it is on so many unknown factors, is likely to be; nor is anyone able to accurately forecast what fill be the ability of the tenant to pay as much as 25 per cent, increased rental in addition to the increased jutes.   . .  &apos; \&apos; &apos; &apos;5. The increase recommended in the Report would benefit first and foremost the mortgagee, the owners&apos; taisideration being secondary.   The first increase of 10 per cent, would largely pass to the mortgagee and theOwners should be entitled to increase their rent, at the end, of six months after the termination of the war, by an amount not exceeding 10 per cent, of the rents exclusive of rates.At the expiration of another twelve months they should he entitled to increase their rents further by an amount not exceeding 15 per cent, of the present rents, exclusive of rates, upon obtaining a certificate from the Local Authority to the effect that the house in respect of which the increase in rent is comtemplated is, at the time of the certificate, in reasonable tenantable repair and condition.   (Paras. 25-34)(2) In the case of agricultural cottages, if in any district the standard rent, with the addition recom-mended by us, be less than the value for the time being fixed for a labourers cottage for the purposes of calculating [the benefits which may be reckoned-as payment \of wages in lieu of ca.sh in the case of any minimum rate of wages under the Corn Production Act, 1917, then that value should be taken as the maximum rental for tie time being under the Increase of Rent, etc., Acts.   (Paras. 40-41.)(3) The County Court (in Scotland, the Sheriff Court) should have power to vary the 11 standard rent&quot; in certain particular cases.   (Paras. 36-38.)(4) In cases where a person lias purchased a dwelling house since the 30th September, 1917, and requires the, premises for his own occupation, or that of some person in his employ or in the employ of some tenant from him, a County Court Judge should have power, upon application being made to him, to make an order for possession if, after consideration of all the circumstances, including the presence or otherwise of suitable alternative accommodation, he shall consider it reasonable.   (Paras. 50-52.)(5) The restrictions should not apply to houses built hereafter.   (Paras. 53-54.)(6) Thte &quot; rateable values&quot; of houses falling within the Acts should not be increased during the con-tinuance, of the restrictions, in consequence of the additions to rent which we recommend should be permitted; houses built hereafter should, be put into as good a position as regards rating as similar existing houses; and certain other alterations shoidd. be made in regard to rates and, taxes.   (Paras. 42-49.)
* Information necessary to apply this suggestion already exists in the office of the Local Fuel Overseer.f The Income Tax Assessment (Schedule A) is equal to the aggregate of five years&apos; allowances, made at the rate of ith off the Gross Assessment, to cover the cost of repairs, etc., at the pre-war rate. Our proposal should not be&apos;considered unfavourable to the landlord since, if repairs have been executed during the war at, say, a maximum of 100 per cent, above the pre-war cost, an owner who has duly expended the statutory allowance has carried out less work actually than he would have done had the cost of repairs been normal.margin left to the owner would he no encouragement to him to overtake arrears of necessary repairs. It seems to us a distinctly more urgent matter that overdue repairs should be executed forthwith than that tin mortgagee should receive an additional income.6. We regret, therefore, our inability to agree to any proposal to increase rents immediately in order to give a higher rate of interest to the mortgagee. If, however, it should he decided to make a concession to the mortgagee and owner as compensation for the restrictions imposed by the further extension of the Acts, it is suggested that, because the legislation proposed is essentially in the national interest with a vift to preventing unrest during what is bound to be a troublesome period of reconstruction, any grant in this direction should he borne by the Treasury and take the form of a reduction subject to necessary safeguards, during the currency of the Act, of the amount of Income Tax charged under Schedule A. A decision of this character would assist the mortgagee and the owner and would not be directly detrimental to the tenant: In the event of this proposal being adopted, together with the further recommendation for a greater reduction of,the assessment under Schedxile A to meet increased cost of repairs suggested under paragraph 47 of the Report we believe any hardship which may be deemed to exist as a result of the Committee&apos;s resolution that the Acts should be continued, would be considered as having been reasonably met.7. In our opinion the recommendation to advance all rents covered by the Acts on a percentage basis will, if adopted, be productive of a substantial number of anomalies and of real hardships upon owners aiij tenants. From our point of view a most valuable piece of evidence is referred to in the concluding passages of paragraph 14 of the Report. The differences therein mentioned of net return for money invested in household property are very remarkable and it appears to us to be conclusively established that the real cause of comparatively high rents in London is found in the fact that the London owner has not hitherto been satisfied unless he was receiving from 2 per cent, to 3 per cent, per annum above the rate of profit which has recompensed the provincial and Scottish landlord. This marked difference in the treatment ol tenants constitutes, in our judgment, a strong reason why a percentage basis should not be adopted in any increase of rent decided upon. In the application of paragraph 34 the owner who has been satisfied to let his property at a fair rental stands, probably, .in the same&apos; position towards his mortgagee as the owner whose rents have been no less than he could possibly obtain; but the latter would get preferential treatment if rents are permitted to rise on a percentage scale. In fact, legislation on the lines suggested in the Report would penalise the landlord who has been satisfied with a moderate return on his capital, and ensure that the tenant who pays the highest comparative rent would pay still higher. Apart altogether from the question as to whether the rents of household property, which has yielded 8 per cent, per annum net should be allowed to rise with the object of giving a still greater return to investors, the flat rate of increase of 25 per cent, on actual rent less rates, would emphasise and widen the varying inequalities and differentiations of rents generally, and would prove, in practice, unsatisfactory to landlords and tenants alike. Many houses have been built on loans at a fixed rate of interest (e.g., State loans and Building Society advances), and there would appear to be no legitimate reason to advance rents to meet additional interest charges in these cases-seeing that there is no recommendation to revise the terms of the loan. It should not be overlooked that in some districts whole villages are the property of commercial companies built for the housing of work people employed in the undertakings and any increases of rent beyond the amount necessary to meet any additional cost of repairs would presumably add to the dividends of the shareholders which may or may not be already adequate. After giving the position our most careful consideration we think it is most unwise to adopt the suggestion of increasing rents by a fixed percentage, unless there is set up some machinery to deal with a number of anomalies which such legislation would undoubtedly produce.8. The proposals in paragraph 34 dealing with repairs appear to need strengthening. It is observed that the first 10 per cent, rise is to be allowed whether the dwelling house is in good repair or otherwise, This would enable the owner of what is termed &quot; slum &quot; property to get 10 per cent, additional rent. We feel.keenly that this should be provided against. No increase whatsoever should be authorised in respect ol &quot; slum&quot; property; an advance of rent &quot;to cover any further cost of repairs would only perpetuate the existence,of these undesirable dwellings; they should be demolished on the demand of a vigorous State Directed Policy instead of being made more remunerative to their respective owners.We are in favour of allowing rents to rise sufficiently to meet increased expenditure on repairs, but we want to provide that the execution of the repairs, at present sadly neglected, precedes the rise in rents.Contracts between landlord and tenant as to repairs, vary considerably as between different areas, andwe are of opinion that an allowance for any additional cost of repairs founded, not upon the rent paid, but upon the size* of the messuage would be more equitable and we recommend accordingly.We alsp recommend that (a) the word repairs be defied so as to include such decorative or beautifying repairs internal orexternal as are usually carried out by tie owner;(b) before any increase of rent takes place the owner should, in addition to obtaining the certificate - from the Local Authority as provided in the Report (paragraph 34), declare that there has been spent upon the dwelling house in respect to which an increased rental is reauested, during the preceding five years, a sum or sums for repairs aggregating an amount equal to the net annual value for Income Tax (Schedule A)t such declaration to be subject to a fixed penalty unless the owner proves the same to be correct. *(c) if at any time the dwelling house is not in reasonable and tenantable repair and condition, thetenant shall be entitled to apply to the County Court for a reduction of rent;(d) the post-war cost of repairs be reviewed from, time to time and any necessary adjustment in the allowance for repairs over and above the standard rent effected.9. We must also take exception to the further increases of rent recommended in paragraph 38, in connection with sub-letting, &amp;c.   The majority of the houses within these Acts have always been let without
Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office By DARLING and SON, Limited, Bacon Street, E.2.(striction of the right of letting furnished or unfurnished rooms and the standard rent was based upon this nderstanding. To increase the rents by an alteration of the terms of tenancy in the manner suggested is, e submit, only another form of obtaining scarcity rents which will press hardest Upon tenants with families ml will tend to intensify overcrowding.The words &quot; appreciably lower &quot; should be more strictly denned in relation to houses let at a lower rent aii those prevailing in the district and the suggestion to vary the standard rent in such cases should not, nder any circumstances, apply to sitting tenants.10. With paragraphs 50, 5.1, and 52 we are mainly in agreement but we are entirely against any luxation of the clauses of the original Act and the amending Act referred to. It would, however, in our jinion be entirely against public policy to allow thousands upon thousands of tenants to be turned out of eir homes with no prospect of finding other accommodation during the present and prospective house ortage, in order that the speculative landlord might obtain a scarcity value on sale of his property with ssession. We, therefore, must view with some misgiving the suggestion that discretion should be granted County Court Judges to decide when possession should be given to purchasers. 1 In this connection we desire to point out that the phrase in the original Act (sub-section 3, section 1)  reasonably required by the landlord for the occupation of himself or some other person in his employ, or the employ of some tenant from him, or on some other ground which may be deemed satisfactory by the nut &quot; lias been variously interpreted, according to the dissimilar views of different Judges, in a manner which we believe does not reflect the intention of Parliament when the Act was passed.Evidence was placed before the Committee by Mr. H. Schultess Young&apos;, Barrister-at-Law, and Mr. J. H. illey, J.P., of the injustice of permitting ejectment cases to be brought in the Police Court and before deal Justices instead of in the County Court as provided in the Acts and the Rules set for their administra-iii. Whilst such applications under the Small Tenements Act are permitted tenants occupying houses ider a yearly rental of  20 are deprived of many of the provisions of the special legislation embodied in the tts under consideration. Therefore we recommend that this defect from the tenants&apos; point of view should remedied.11. With regard to the more summary method of ejectment advocated in paragraph 57 we can only press our astonishment that this should be recommended. Where are the ejected families to find other commodation when an ejectment order is summarily obtained? The scarcity of houses must continue for reral years and simultaneously there will be the tremendous changes involved in the re-settlement of return-? soldiers and demobilised munition workers. We are convinced that for the next few years the life of llions of working class families will be a most anxious one. The tenant must have regard to his landlord&apos;s jperty and respect for all the conditions of the tenancy and we want the landlords&apos; interest properly pro-:ted; but we are strongly of opinion that the proposal for more summary ejectment should not be entertained, incidence has been submitted to the Committee that during the past three years a certain type of agent and ner has advanced the most trivial plea as a breach of the tenancy agreement in order to obtain an ejectment iler for no other reason than that the tenant had refused to be intimidated into paying increased&apos; rent, e would not only not place more power in the hands of this class of property owner&apos; and agent but we would pose stringent penalties upon all who attempted to intimidate tenants into paving more than the legal it.12. In our opinion the absence of any restriction of rents on houses not falling within the restrictions posed by these Acts is bound to accentuate the demand for houses which are restricted and thus render the oblem of housing the working classes still more a&apos;cute, which will remain until schemes of house building iture. There is an abundance of information that the tenants of houses outside the scope of the Increase Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act, .19.15, are being made to pay much higher rentals, sumably to meet the landlords increased income tax. Competition for restricted houses would undoubtedly lessened if the owners of houses of higher rateable values than those dealt with herein were restrained from wdinately increasing the rents of such houses.13. As the extension of these Acts is recommended for only a further period of 21 years we have not rocated the creation of any new tribunal for their administration but we recommend that before the time fixed for the expiry of these Acts, the Government shovbl thoroughly investigate the position as it then exists wi+li a view to ascertaining how far the establishment of Rent Courts are advisable for dealing with all matters appertaining to landlord and tenant.WILLIAM B.
