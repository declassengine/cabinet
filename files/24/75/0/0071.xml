Ay/.ministry  OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, February 19, 1919.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.The Food Controller addressed a meeting of editors of London and Provincial papers on February 18th on the question of decontrol and reduction in food prices. The following is brief summary of his statement, part of which was for the confidential information of the meeting and not for publication: (1) During the first three years of the war, up to July 1917, food prices rose steadily and rapidly at the rate of 2*87 per cent, per month. On Lord Rhondda&apos;s appointment as Food Controller, a marked change took place. During the 16 months from July, 1917, to the end of hostilities, although food prices continued to increase, they did so at a far slower rate, namely 1&apos; 87 per cent, per month. On the termination of hostilities there was another change. During the last three months, from November 1st to February 1st, 1919, prices have declined slightly in this country, though they have continued to rise in nearly all other countries. This decline is certainly continuing and it may safely be anticipated that next month will show an appreciable fall of food prices as a whole.(2) H.M. Treasury have agreed to bear any loss incurred upon decontrol taking place in the disposal of stocks of foodstuffs held by the Ministry which were acquired under war conditions and at war rates, provided that by decontrol prices will be reduced to, and maintained at, a lower level.(3) Since February 1st the prices of condensed milk, dried fruits, and beer have been reduced; steps have been taken by which margarine and tea will be decontrolled at an early date, which will be accompanied by a reduction in prices; and it has been decided that a reduction of 2d. per lb. in the price of both home-grown and imported meat shall take effect as from March 1st. The two main difficulties in the face of an immediate decontrol of meat are that supplies must not be freed while there is .any risk of the market being dominated by the Meat Trust, and that, in order to secure that adequate supplies of home-grown meat should come forward, it has been necessary to guarantee prices for live stock until September 30th next.(4) Sugar was taken as an instance of a foodstuff in which decontrol would lead to a considerable rise in price. The wholesale price at which sugar is now being sold in this country is considerably below the price at which it would stand on imports purchased to-day in the producing market. . The present wholesale selling prices are about 21. per ton below the price at which sugar could be got from Java, and about 111. per I ton below the price of Cuban sugar. The estimate which has been made by the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply of the world&apos;s production and consump-tion for 1919 shows that there will only be a moderate margin of supply over consumption. If sugar were decontrolled, the price would almost certainly rise, and there would be danger that the supply would not meet the demand.(5) In some further cases, the question whether decontrol would, in fact, lead to reduction in price is doubtful. It is, for instance, by no means certain whether the price of hogs and consequently of American bacon will rise or fall. There is still some uncertainty as to tea. If the Russian demand becomes effective, then the world&apos;s supply will probably be less than the world&apos;s need, and prices will, tend to rise; if not, prices may fall or keep stationary. On the whole the Ministry have felt justified in acting on the latter assumption.a (33)7383-4   pk9  150  2/19   8 k S aSECRET.
(6) The following considerations were also emphasised : (a) The Food Controller was specially instructed on taking up his office to deal with the question of food prices, and the bearing of this question on industrial unrest is realised. On the other hand, excessive publicity may defeat its own object and actually stimulate industrial unrest by encouraging the idea that the working classes have just ground for impatience.(6) The threatened coal strike adds an element of considerable difficulty. In order to protect the public against the consequences of such a strike, it is essential that foodstuffs should be distributed as widely as possible, and, in particular, it is necessary to encourage wholesalers and retailers to carry large stocks. Any uncertainty as to prices however, and, in particular, any prospect of a rapid fall without notice, will certainly prevent wholesalers and retailers from holding stocks. The Ministry of Food do not mind losing on their own stocks, but it is a. different matter to cause a loss to private traders.(c) Our relations to the Allies have also a bearing.   In order to promote pro-duction of food in the. United States, Mr. Hoover gave certain liberal &apos; guarantees to American producers on the assumption that Europe would need to be feed mainly from North America since tonnage to carry the cheaper stocks from the Southern Hemisphere could not be found. These cheaper stocks are now becoming available, but the British Government have at least some moral obligation to take part of their supplies from North America (including Canada) and assist the Food Authorities there to bear part of their guarantee.(d) The existence of trusts which constitutes a very real difficulty makespremature decontrol dangerous in certain cases.Inter-Departmental Committee on reduction of Food Prices. The first and second meetings of the Committee were held on February 14th and February .18th. i - . The Committee have decided (a) that a reduction of 2d. a lb. in the price of both home-grown and imported meat should come into effect as from March 1st. It was generally considered that this course was to be preferred to a larger reduction in the price of imported meat only. &apos; (b) that a further reduction in the price of meat should be brought into effect on or before May 1st, and that in connection with this reduction the question of differentiating between the prices of home-grown and imported meat should be considered.Food Council-Meetings of the Council were held on February I3th and 18th.It was agreed that an immediate announcement should be made of the Food Controllers intention of suspending at the earliest practicable date the Orders governing the distribution and price of tea, and that contracts for the period after May 31st, when the present contracts expire, should not be placed.An undertaking was given to the Council by Sir John Beale that any loss on the sale of 30,000 tons of bacon to&apos;Germany,, which had been approved by H.M. Treasury, would be adjusted on future transactions. Sir John Beale also stated, that there appeared to be no risk that Germany would be in a position to buy hog products in such quantities as to force up the price, and, further, that Mr. Hoover had given an assurance that there would be no abnormal rise in the price of hog products to this country. It was agreed that, in the circumstances, arrangements for the decontrol of bacon, hams, and lard might safely proceed.Memoranda&apos; embodying proposals on the future policy of milk control were considered. - It was agreed that in the first instance an inter-departmental conference should be held between the Ministry of Food, the Local Government Boards and the Boards of Agriculture for England and Scotland to consider the merits of the proposals made, and the procedure to be followed in order to give effect to them.;&apos;   Consumers1 Council. The Council met on February 19th.The Council discussed State Control of Milk, and passed&apos; the following resolution :  &apos;&apos;,    ,&quot;This Council appreciates the measures taken by the Ministry for the national and local distribution of milk, but. having regard to the vital importance of this article of food to mothers and young&quot; children, expresses
-   .     the opinion that the production, quality, and supply can no longer be left to hazardous enterprise and initiative, and urges upon the Ministry the necessity \: .      of taking early and effective steps to ensure an adequate supply under national&apos;&apos;.The attention&quot;of the Council, was called to the view of the Chief Commissioner of Police that in the event of the decontrol of certain articles it was to be feared that.queues, dissatisfaction, and unrest would result.Supplies and Distribution.Cereals. The following information has been sent to Viscount Wolmer at his request: Only one purchase of foreign wheat, viz., 6,500 tons of Argentine wheat has been made this year. This is still unshipped. The Wheat Executive, however, hold on behalf of the Allied Governments, unshipped stocks in Canada, the United States, the Argentine and other markets upwards of 31 million tons of wheat and wheat flour purchased during 1918. Shipments are proceeding in the normal manner as tonnage and discharging facilities are available. During January approximately 500,000 tons were despatched to Europe.Cheese. In the month of January the stocks of cheese were only sufficient to warrant a 25 per cent, distribution being made to the civilian population, and this is no doubt the explanation of why cheese is so short in the retail shops at the present moment. On February 11th a 50 per cent, distribution for the month of February was issued. This cheese should commence to arrive in the retail shops early next week, although in certain parts of the country it may not arrive until some time later, owing to transport difficulties.The cheese in stock previous to this distribution only covered seven weeks&apos; supply on a 50 per cent, distribution basis. The quantity in course of distribution at the present time is 9,500 tons, made up of 8,500 tons on ordinary distribution and 1,000 tons issued through the Divisional Pood Commissioners under the Emergency Supply Scheme; this forms the supply for 41 weeks. The remainder of the stock on hand, 2f weeks&apos; supply, is held over to form the nucleus of a further prospective &apos;50 per cent, distribution in the month of March.The difficulty at the present time is that although the Ministry has plenty of cheese &quot;in store in New Zealand, the effect of the extra shipping does not operate so far as arrivals are concerned until the month of May, from which time there will be ample supplies of cheese to meet all demands., New Zealand and Australia are the only sources of supply for cheese at the present moment, with the exception of a lot of 4,000 tons which is being obtained from.: Holland on an exchange arrangement for bacon.Bacon, Hams and Lard. The arrivals for this week show a slight increase. Arrangements are being made to secure a better distribution of the Ministry^ stocks by moving a certain quantity of bacon from the ports to inland areas. The amount of lard issued this week was again 4,000 tons.An agreement having been reached for the sale of 30,000 tons of pork products to Germany, an order for 5,000 tons in replacement is being placed in Canada, the balance being obtained from the United States. Arrangements are in progress for the shipment of a first consignment of 5,000 tons of bacon and lard to Germany.Milk. Reports from Divisional Commissioners show that, notwithstanding the colder weather, the supplies of milk have been satisfactory.The travelling Commission of Inquiry into the cost of production of milk has begun its work, the first sitting having been&apos;-held at Derby on the 17th and 18th February. The Commission will visit all the Divisional Food Commissioners&apos; Areas in due course, and it is hoped that the investigations will be completed before the end of March.Fish. It is reported from the North of England Division that there/ is an appreciable increase in supplies of fish. The improvement is due in part to the fact that two large trawlers have been released by the Admiralty for use. In the North-Western Division in the past fortnight 18,530 boxes, equivalent to 1,161 tons, have been landed at Fleetwood, a great part of which was sold below controlled prices.&apos; Supplies of fish in the North-Eastern Division are good, and a total amount of 4,519 tons: was landed between January 1st and February 13th.
From the North Midlands it is stated that at Grimsby last week 117 vessels landed catches, amounting to 70,480 lbs. of prime iish, all of which have been duly allocated. In the Midlands supplies have improved considerably and the appearance of salmon in the market is said to have been of material assistance in this respect.During last week prices in wholesale markets were again, in many cases, below the maximum prices fixed by Order. The question of suspending controlled prices is now under consideration.Tea. Another sale of tea for export only has been held, at which, owing to the &quot;strong continental demand, increased prices were realised. It has been decided to hold a further sale shortly.Goeoa. At the Raw Cocoa Distribution Meeting, which will be held on 20th February, some 3,244 tons of raw cocoa will be distributed, which, with last week&apos;s interim allocation, will give manufacturers over 6,000 tons. The position of supplies is extremely satisfactory.Opening of Businesses by Discharged Men. Arrangements have been made by which discharged men wishing to re-open an old food business or to establish a new food business in a district where they previously traded receive afCertificate of Regis-tration at once and are given special facilities for obtaining supplies in advance of their immediate requirements, and for having their old customers transferred to them.Emergency demands. Reports received from Divisional Food Commissioners with regard to distribution of supplies show that the emergency measures required to meet the demands made by the large influx into many areas of demobilised soldiers, by the closing of munition Avorks, and by dislocation of trail sport in home districts owing to strikes, have been successful in preventing any serious shortage of supplies.Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.Order dated the 11th February 1919, amending the Live Stock (Sales) Order, 1918, embodies the revised prices agreed as from the 1st February.Order dated the l^th February 1919, amending the Grain (Prices) Order, 1917, revokes clause 11 of the principal Order, which prohibited grain from being torrified or bleached. Grain which has been subjected to either of these processes may be sold only by weight, and the maximum prices are those otherwise chargeable plus a usual and reasonable charge for the treatment.A General Licence dated )Ath February 1919, under the Otis and Fats (Restriction) Order, I918, frees lard from the restrictions imposed by the Order limiting its use to foodstuffs.A General Licence dated 14th February 1919, under the Sugar Order, 1917, and the Sugar (Restriction) Order, 1918, allows manufacturers as from 24th February to purchase without a coupon and without any restriction as to quantity, certain low grades of sugar sold only for manufacturing purposes.An Order dated 14ih February 1919, revokes the Vegetable Marrow Order, 1918, which controlled the price of vegetable marrows, and gave priority for their use by jam manufacturers.The following Orders have been revoked as from 1st March:  The Sale of Sweetmeats (Restriction) Order, the Sale of Sweetmeats (Restriction) (Ireland), Order, the Sale of Sweetmeats in Theatres (Restriction) Order. The object of these Orders was to secure that persons who were wholly or mainly dependent on such sales for their livelihood, should be able to secure supplies. Increased supplies of sugar render it unnecessary now to exclude other traders.The Dealings in Sugar (Restriction) Order, 1917, which prohibited dealings in sugar outside the United Kingdom except under licence.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions reported during the week ending the 8th February was 967, of which 910 resulted in convictions. The average fine for England, Scotland, and Wales was 5Z. 7s. Id., and for Ireland 2s. Sd. Prosecutions were reported under 69 different Orders.A sentence of one month&apos;s imprisonment with hard labour was passed upon Jean England, Woolwich, who picked up the ration books of three persons which had been left upon a shop counter, and used them for the purchase of rationed articles.

With the rise of prices to farmers coming into force at the beginning of the month, supplies of cattle and sheep in Great Britain were fully double those of the preceding week, and the estimated supplies of home-killed meat of all kinds rose to 16,600 tons. With a decrease of only 2,600 tons in the high level of imported meat issues, total supplies of butchers&apos; meat came to 24,800 tons, of which 20,400 tons were available to meet the weekly ration requirement of 18,500 tons. Against this large quantity, however, must be set the exceptionally low quantity for consumption in the preceding week, since consumers&apos; demands on the coupon may be carried forward to the middle of the following week. On the estimated quantities for the two weeks taken together, the consumption of rationed meat was still 5 per cent, below the quantity which the public might purchase on the ration.Bacon. The returns made by bacon-curers show that the total quantity cured in January was 8,500 tons. This output is substantially better than that of January 1918 (7,000 tons), and represents about one-fifth of the total consumption of home and imported bacon together. Home-production in the year 1918 provided only one-seventh of the total consumption, as compared with a pre-war proportion of about one-third.Jam. The returns from jam manufacturers give the total output in January as 12,000 tons of jam and 20,700 tons of marmalade, or together 32,700 tons. Jam stocks decreased from 14,800 tons to 8,900 tons, while marmalade stocks increased from 3,600 tons to 9,400 tons. These figures indicate a consumption of manufactured jam amounting to 17,900 tons, equivalent to a weekly consumption per head of 3&quot;3oz., apart from 14,900 tons of marmalade.Principal Foodstuffs. Table B (1) shows a general increase in the quantities of the principal foodstuffs passing into dealers&apos; hands; in the case of flour and bacon,a   7383-4 Bi     -.,\ hi.,! PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION. r&apos;    &quot;&quot;&apos;&apos; Imports.The week ended 15th February showed a large falling off in the imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs, the total (103,500 tons) being the smallest recorded since 19th January 1918. Cereals were especially low; wheat and flour imports amounted to only 29,600 tons of equivalent grain as compared with an average of 99,600 tons in the first 24 weeks of the cereal year and were the lowest since the week ended 30th March ; a small quantity only of oats (1,600 tons) and practically no barley (35 tons) were entered. On the other hand, maize imports (19,000 tons; were above the low averages which have obtained since September 1917, and there was a large import of rice (11,500 tons). Sugar imports (11,400 tons) were low. Of provisions, less than 700 tons of butter was entered, but imports of cheese (2,300 tons) and condensed milk (2,700 tons) were fully equal to the average for 1918 ; on the other hand, imports of bacon (8,200 tons) and lard (1,300 tons), though substantial, showed a tendency to fall.   A relatively large import of coffee (1,200 tons) arrived.The figures for the first 24 weeks of the cereal years 1917-18 and 1918-19 are compared in the following table.
this is in accordance with the policy of the Ministry to increase stocks held by local traders and householders. In the case of sugar it reflects the increased supplies to meet the higher ration.The estimated current rale of consumption of the principal articles of food per head of population within the United Kingdom is given in the following table. Estimated figures are also given for the pre-war consumption. In making a oom-parison it should be borne in mind that the winter consumption may differ from the average rate for the year and that the constitution of the pre-war population included a larger proportion of men.Weekly Consumption per Head.-	Pre-war	Present	(Annual Average).

During the ensuing week the stocks of meat fell &apos;4,300 tons, or 3 per cent, (principally&quot;beef); bacon and hams, 2,700 tons, or 4 per cent.; cheese, 900 tons, or 6 per cent. ; and lard 600 tons, or 2 per cent. There were no increases of any importance. The quantity of bacon stored by the Ministry declined to.a greater extent-namely, from 52,200 tons to 42,000 tons.
