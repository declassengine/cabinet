elections/291.WAR  .CABIJ9ET..o   Soldiers and Parliamentary Elections.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.Under the Act to regulate the btations of Soldiers during Parliamentary Elections, (10 ft 11 Victoria, Cap.SI) 23rd April, 1847) it is provided that -&quot;On every day appointed for the nomination or for the election for for taking the poll for the elect-ion of a member or members to serve in the Commons House of Parliament no soldier within 3 miles of any City, borough, Town or place where sucn Humiliation or election shall be declared or polx taken, shall bo Allowed to go. out of the barrack or quarters in which he is 3vr:io&apos;asd, unless for the purpose of mounting or relieving gu.ird or for giving his vote at such elec&amp;ion and that every soldier allowed to go out for any such purpose within the limits &apos;aJ&apos;^..esaid shall return to his barrack or quarters with all convenie.it speed.* .   o   *  *  .Section 3 of the Act lays down that whenever a writ for an election is issued the Clerk of the Crown shall give notice to the Secretary of Btate for -Var, who shall notify in writing the local military authorities concerned instructing the latter to take action to enforce the provisions of the Act.For &quot;some considerable time it has been apparent that the necessity for such restrictions no longer exist.   The Act was passed before the Ballot Act and is not applicable to present day conditions when a much larger proportion of soldiers than formerly have the franchise.        &quot; *The law permits non-commissioned officers and men to leave barracks for no purpose other nthan mounting or relieving guard or recording their votes.   In some cases the military Headquarter Offices, the Record Offices and the Pay Offices are located some distance from the barracks and on occasions this has rendered it necessary to suspend work at these offices for several days during an election.The ceremony of nomination generally takes place in the middle of tho day and occupies only a short time.   There does not appear to bo any reason for depriving soldiers of the ordinary&apos; liberties of the citizen on such occasions,ITo legal restrictions of this nature are imposed on sailors or airmen.During the recent general election considerable prominence was given to the matter and there was a good deal of agitation on the subject.   The question was brought before the War Cabinet who decided that soldiers should not be confined to barracks on polling day.It was also decided that if this decision, in contravention of the Act of 1847, were challenged, the House of Commons should be asked for indemnity having regard to the fact that the matter had been overlooked during the stress cf war.It is now proposed that the Act should be repealed.   The necessary provision could be included in any Act to amend the Representation of the People Act-   No doubt such an-wae^di/?g Act will be required to correct defects discovered as a result of the vecert general election but in any case, it is thought that a special Bill to repeal the Act of 1M7 would meet with no opposition in Parliament and could be quickly passes ae soon as a convenient opportunity arose.&apos; (Sd.)   Winston S. Churchill 19th February, 1919. j
