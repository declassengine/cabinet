[This Document is the property of Hie Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Secret. G.T* 6864.WAR CAB BEET. &quot;Office Accommodation.&quot; Memorandum by the President of the Bo^rd of Agrioulture and Fisheries.The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries is called upon, in addition to its normal functions, to promote increased production and to settle ex-Serviae men on the land.     Progress in these two directions, to say nothing of the Board&apos;s minoa? activities, is checked and delayed by the want of office accommodation.     My own headquarters pre at 4, Whitehall Plaae, but the Food Production and Land Drainage Departments are housed near Victoria Station; the Reclamation Branch is lodged at 3, Great College Streetj Westminster;   and other almost equally important Sections are located at St. James&apos;s Square, Pall Ms11, Parliament Street, and elsewhere.     In all, 19 different sets of buildings, more or less distant from one another, are at present occupied.     Loss of time, loss of papers, loss of reputation, are inevitable.The Board urgently needs a building, or a series of buildings adjoining one another, of sufficient size to bring all the Heads of the various Division of the Department, if not under the same roof, then within reasonable reach of myself and of the Permanent Secretary.     No other Arrangement permits that constant personal touch between the chief officials and myself, and between the various officials with one another, which is essential to promptitude of action.     Any commercial firm of standing in this country would be hopelessly beaten in the race of industrial enterprise if it were in the present position of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,Armament Buildings, in Whitehall Place, was especially planned and built for the accommodation of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.    But on completion, early in the war, it was taken over by the Ministry of Munitions,     At that time munitions were certainly entitled to first claims on any available building. The position has now altered.     I fully realise the importance of the Ministry of Supplies , now in possession of Armament Buildings. But I think that the claims of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries who are now responsible for carrying out important pledges of the Government, are, at the present time, greater.     Whether the business of the Ministry of Supplies increases or decreases, the work of the Board of Agriculture is bound to expand rapidly, both in bulk and importance.     The necessity for the proper housing of the Board of Agriculture during the period of unexampled pressure is so great that, unless Armament Buildings, or some equally suitable accommodation, can be rapidly placed at the Board&apos;s disposal, it is difficult to accept responsibility for the prompt and effective discharge of the duties laid upon the president.If a decision could be reached that the 3o--rd would enter into possession of Armament Buildings in one year, or two years, or never, it would be a heip.     At present we can only enter into agreements for short terms.BRHLE.February 22nd. 1919.
