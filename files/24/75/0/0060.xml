This Document is t&apos;:o Pmnerty of   /lis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government^     &apos; &apos; &apos;  &apos;&quot;   / MlHISTHY OF HSALTH. M.H.2.m BY THE PHESI DIBIT 03? THE LOCAL G0VKRHM1TI BOARD.I think it is of groat and urgont importance that the Cabinet should give a definite ruling(a) that no Department of State shall create a new Medical Branch within its owj province;(b) that no Department of State shall expand an already existing Medical Branch or make new medical appoint-menta or establish a revised scale of medical salaries;without the concurrence of the President of the Local Government Board.8.     There are now in the Government not less than 20Departments having some kind of medical responsibility.   Exclud-ing the war1 Office, Admiralty and Air Fores, the principalDepartments4 concerned with Medicine are five in number, namely,&apos;l) Local Government Board.2) National Health Insurance Commission.3) Board of Education.4J Home Office.5) Ministry of Pensions.There are also a number of Departments which have minor MedicalBranches.3.    It is obvious that the organisation of a comprehensive State Service of Public Health to which the Government is committed involves close and effective co-operation between the several Departments, and that such 60-operation can hardly be secured unless one Department is treated as a Central Health Department charged with functions of co-ordination.   The inten-tiona of the Government may be greatly prejudiced both pending the establishment of a Ministry of Health and subsequently, unless precautions are taken against extensions of overlapping, the inconsiderate creation of important vested interests, the establishment of unnecessary medical machinery, central and local, and the further complication of unoo-ordinated salary scales.8al Government Board, C- ^?D*S H&apos;        ,ftnrtMtehall, S.W.I. 21 February, 1919.
