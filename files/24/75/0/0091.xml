&quot;^fflttf&quot;Bot?iment is the Preperty of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. [February 20, 1919.]Political  Intelligence  Department, Foreign Office.       &apos;Germany /036.MEMORANDUMonGERMAN FORECASTS.\ I. The Two Consolations.A QUESTION which, it seems important to consider is what hopes and aspirations we desire the new German)7 to cherish. It is certain that a nation, like an individual, wants to have something to look forward to.* We have destroyed the visions upon which the German lived in the day of his power; it would be vain to expect the German people to accept their present condition of profound weakness and humiliation as permanent. If to try to block all vistas into a happier future for the German people would be the worst of all possible policies, we are unquestionably concerned to know whether such new visions of the future as the Germans form are free from any menace to the rest of the world.&quot; Now after the war there is no danger any longer,&quot; writes Naumann.(&quot; Die Hilfe&quot;; for 28th November, p. 5G9), &quot;that the awakening of the national spirit might mean fresh military adventures. That is wholly a thing of the past (&apos; Das ist griindlich vorbei&apos;).&quot; Of Radek&apos;s suggestion that Bolshevik Russia and Spartacist Germany might fight side by side on the Rhine against the Entente, Naumann writes (&quot; Hilfe&quot; for the 23rd January): &quot; The idea of a Russo-German war against the Entente Powers is now, after the break-up of the German army, pure madness. We must say that with such emphasis in order that no one abroad may be led by irresponsible talk to suppose that we have not had enough of war by this time (&apos; als batten wir am bisherigen Krieg noch nicht genug gehabt&apos;).&quot;The Germans seem disposed to seek refuge from the distresses of the present hour mainly in two consolatory lines of thought. Whatever humiliations and impoverishment the issue of the war has brought them, it has brought them two good things : 1. One is the realisation of the old dream of a united German Fatherland, extending over the whole Central-European area whose speech is German (with the exception, of course, of German Switzerland and Alsace). This is the outcome of the break-up of Austria-Hungary, which has set free the Austrian Germans to join the Reich. To this thought German writers recur again and again. Again, there were the inner divisions within the Reich, between one State and another, the continuation of the old particularism, The new Germany is to be one in a completer sense than the Hohenzollern Empire.&quot; Now we can rebuild our hcuse from the foundations in another way than our fathers did in 1871. Then all kinds of dynastic and particularistic separate interests and prejudices had to be taken into account. To-day the princes have been hurled from their thrones, they constitute an impediment no more. On the broad basis of the whole German, people, including our Austrian brethren, we can now rear the fabric of a unitary German State, the united State of the free German people. How the several German States worked against each other during the war for instance on the question of the food supply ! How much more difficult were singleness of purpose, determination in action, and clearness of aim made by the Bundesrat, by the &apos; Federated Governments,&apos; representing the old multiplicity and division !&quot;(Heile, &quot; Die Hilfe &quot; for 21st November, p. 559.)* &quot; Eiu Yolk rerlangt nach mehr als uach der Lebensmoalichkeit. Es verlangt nach sehopferischen Helen.&quot;(Axel Schmidt. &quot; Deutsche Politik&quot; for 17th January, p. 69.)[1130-187] B
&quot; &apos; The whole of Deutschland must it be !&apos; If that fails, what have we left to fix our hopes on ? Our State loses the regions of non-German speech on the east, the west, and the north. Our German Alsatians are driven out and denationalised as far as possible ; the good old German Strassburg is once again desecrated.   In such a situation we must rejoice that the German Austrians desireto come to us, and we ought to stretch out the hand to welcome them.....Themain point to-day is to make it clear that the German Republic is grossdeutsch! It must be built up on the idea that all peoples of German stock have their natural home in the German democratic State (&apos;im deutschen Volksstaat ihre nattirliche Helm at haben&apos;).&quot;(Friedrich Naumann, &quot; Die Hilfe&quot; for 19th December, p. 612.)2. The second good thing which the war has brought is political freedom, democracy, the possibility of vastly improved social institutions. Whatever the merits and demerits of Democracy, as compared with other forms of government, may really be, it is unquestionable that the idea of Democracy has offered the German people at this dark moment something round which a body of new radiant hopes may gather. &quot; No people has such a capacity of all-absorbing enthusiasm for an abstract idea as the German.&quot;&apos; Democracy has become the catch-phrase of the day in Germany and seems to promise a happy future to thousands who have only a superficial conception of political problems. Just as formerly the promise of Germany&apos;s future greatness seemed contained in an idea, that of Machtpolitih, so now Germany&apos;s salvation is discovered in the idea of Democracy. And just as the Germans, when they had got a theory of life in the gospel of Machtpolitih, carried it out with a systematic ruthlessness which appalled the world, so now, they seem determined to be the most democratic of democracies.The idea sometimes occurs that if only Germany can make such a success of Socialism in its new State as to become a pattern for other peoples, Germany will once more have a great position in the world, strong not in arms and material resources, but in moral influence.&quot; We have oue aim that, even for a people so poor, so bruised, so humiliated as this beloved people of ours is to-day, is not impossible, not unattainable, and at the same time is the highest aim in the world that of becoming the State with the best social institutions (&apos; der beste soziale Staat&apos;). It is not in the first instance a matter of material magnitude or money or the goods of fortune, but of method. Let us get our ideal started on its way, however poor we may be, and we shall live to discover that nothing can resist a German spirit and a German aim of this kind.&quot;(J. Moritzen, in &quot; Deutsche Politik,&quot; for 10th January, p. 54.)i 2. A Scheme of Foreign Policy.The new Germany must have a foreign policy of some kind. What is it to be ? Amongst the Germans who have been thinking about this problem is Adolf Grabowsky, one of the younger publicists, who seems to command attention in Germany. He is editor of the fortnightly periodical &quot; Das Neue Deutschland:&quot; On the 20th December he gave a lecture in Berlin on &quot; Guiding Lines for our Future Foreign Policy,&quot; which is reproduced in the number of his periodical for the 1st January. It shows the kind of projects to which thoughtful Germans are now turning. The following abridgment may be of interest.   Passages between inverted commas are translated in full: I. International Presuppositions of any Foreign Policy at thePresent Time.(A.) Foundations.1. &quot;The imperialism of all Great Powers to-day expansive capitalism grabbing all over the world without restraint, a world policy of violent action has been in-increasingly crossed in recent times by tendencies of another kind, tendencies towards humanity, justice, reasonableness. Uncontrolled imperialism naturally provokes such a reaction, and these tendencies could not but be made stronger by the war.   In the* &quot; Die Zukunft wird es lehren, dass kein Volk sich so absolut fiir eine Idee zu begeistern vermag, als gsrade das deutsche.&quot; ;!(J. Moritzen, in &quot;Deutsche Politik&quot; for 10th January, p. 53.)
Middle Ages, and in the days oi the Holy Alliance, humane tendencies generally took a form distinctively Christian. In our time, when the imperialist tendency has become world-wide, the humane tendencies too have reached beyond the Christian countries, and now constitute a world-wide ethical public opinion C eine ethische Weltnieinung&apos;). They are of such a character as to transcend the divisions between State and State. Imperialism also, as a tendency, has this super-State character, but it only becomes concrete when embodied in the policy of a particular Slate. On the other hand, it is just outside the regular policy of a State that these ethical ideas become concrete, as part of the public opinion of the world. No State can set itself against them with impunity. For this reason the&quot; great moral ideas of the time have an ultimate ascendency over imperialism.&quot;2. The reaction against capitalism inside States began earlier. It appears every-where as the idea of social just/ice. One might describe the public opinion referred to in the previous section as the idea of social justice applied to the world of States or as the international conscience.3. Social righteousness in international life implies that foreign policy must be veracious and honest. No more secret diplomacy of the old style. The peoples demand that the transactions between them should be open to the light of day.4. Transactions between State and State can never be public in every detail, but foreign policy must be brought out from the private rooms of diplomats. The mass of the people demands to have a voice in it.(B.) The Age of Cultural Imperialism.1. We have entered upon, a new age, the age of an imperialism which is no longer the uncontrolled activity of the capitalist spirit, but is purely cultural. [It may be here observed that the term Kulturimperialismus is perhaps the most unfortunate one which Grabowsky could possibly have chosen to explain what he means to English readers. Both the term Kultur and the term Imperialisms have an ugly sound. It is the fact that the old regime in Germany used the propaganda of German Kultur as a means of furthering unwholesome political and commercial ambitions. Grabowsky, as he shows further on, means nothing of this kind. He means that States, instead of desiring to exercise over other States a power founded on force, should desire to make their influence tell in the world simply so far as they can offer the world spiritual and moral goods, which the world might willingly receive from them. Grabowsky says himself, &quot; It is with repugnance that I have used the word Kultur so often; unfortunately this much-abused term is the only one we have to designate a totality of mental and moral conditions.&quot;]2. Supposing conflicts arise between the vital necessities of a particular State and the world conscience, what then ? Ought a State to submit itself to the demands of the world conscience, even if that means suicide ? No ; the right of every organism to preserve its life should be a principle recognised by the world-conscience And every &quot;straight-grown State&quot; is an organism. The world-conscience could never therefore require a State to do anything which meant self-destruction.3. By a straight-grown.(&quot; gerade gewachsene &quot;) State is meant one born of really compulsive national or economic necessities. Certain artificial States could have no right to exist if they came into conflict with the world-conscience.4. But even an organic State must never oppose the world-conscience on the plea of self-preservation without making sure that it really is a case of the most extreme necessity (&quot; der ausserste not fall&quot;), in which its very existence is at stake. For a State to plead necessity in a case which is not extreme will ultimately make against, and not for, its preservation.(C.) League of Nations.1. &quot; The existence of strong super-State ideas in the age of Cultural Imperialism limits in a decisive way the sovereignty of particular States. No State is any longer absolute lord in its own domain; everywhere the super-State Will makes itself felt.&quot;2. The super-State will need an organ. This organ is the League of Nations, comprising all States-great, medium, and small as members with equal rights.3. The League of Nations serves above all the purposes of a justice which adjusts the varying ideas of what is legitimate and fair prevailing among the different peoples (&quot;eine ausgleichende Gerechtigkeit&quot;).[1130-187] B 2
II. Considerations peculiar to Germany.(A.) Foundations.1. Germany is called by the great spiritual and intellectual traditions of its past to co-operate in the work of Cultural Imperialism. It must take care not to seem to desire any sort of hegemony. The fellowship of all civilised States (&quot; Kulturstaaten &quot;) is a fundamental principle of the League. If the Entente peoples iu the intoxication of victory are now disposed to fall back into the old-style Imperialism,&quot;Germany must show them the better way.2. &quot; German Imperialism ought never to have been anything but cultural. In its present condition of political impotence Germany cannot possibly exercise any influenceupon the world except of a moral kind.....   Its great task now is to make culturalimperialism, no longer a mere instrument of policy, no longer a weapon in the hand of the weaker, but the expression of Germany&apos;&apos;s inner vocation. Germany will thus not only follow a policy which is honest and veracious, as is required by the principle above stated, but find the way back to its true self.&quot;3. Germany must show itself a State whose new social arrangements are worthy to serve as a model to the world. It must win the world by the force of example. All over the world the eyes of workers and employees must turn to Germany as a pattern State.4. But just institutions are nothing without the free spirit. &quot; Too long we have been the land of mere organisations and institutions.&quot;5. &quot;Our lack of the free spirit caused us to oscillate between the pride of power on the one hand and servility on the other.   In foreign politics we either pursuedPan-German dreams of world dominance or we ran flunkey-wise after other nations.....We must attain true national dignity (&apos; wurde&apos;).&quot;6. &quot; The free spirit means the deletion of militarism. Militarism is nothing but pride of power in those who rule and servility in those who obey. In Prussian-German militarism our apostasy from the honest traditions of the German spirit is embodied more conspicuously than in anything else.&quot;7. &quot; The analogue of militarism in civil administration is bureaucratism. By bureaucratic methods we did not succeed in forcing through our Weltpolitik under the old-style imperialism; still less will such methods avail in the new age.&quot;8. &quot; Militarism and bureaucratism do not try to enter into other men by psychological understanding; they put the power to command in the place of ability to convince. Our defective psychological knowledge of other peoples, our psychological obtuseness in dealing with foreign nations, are due to our militarismand bureaucratism.....    We must learn the psychology of peoples (&apos; Volker-psychologie&apos;).&quot;(B.) The relation of Germany to Foreign Powers.1. Germany must be ready to enter the League of Nations, but must also be prepared for the eventuality of the League failing to come into existence or turning out to be a mere League of the Entente Powers, from which Germany is indefinitely excluded.2. Germany will seek close friendly relations with those peoples who sympathise with its cultural policy. &quot; But it must not count on an alliance with any other Power. Separate alliances are incompatible with the idea of the League of Nations, and Germany especially must take care that this principle is not contravened in practice.&quot; Supposing the League fails to come about, Germany on account of its impotence will not be regarded by any Power as an ally worth having (&quot; nicht bundnisfahig&quot;) in the near future. A Bolshevist Germany might indeed form an alliance with Bolshevist Russia, but that would be a disastrous consummation, not to be wished.3. If Russia throws off Bolshevism, its economic needs will draw it to the side of the Entente. Russia will become a Federal State, so that we must not regard separate political action, on the part of the Ukraine, for instance, as a possibility in the future. A consequence of the Ententes helping Russia to economic productiveness will be that the opposition of Slav to German will be deepened, especially since Poland would be able to get on quite happily with a non-Bolshevist Russia. Again, the aggressive Slavism of the Slav nationalities formerly under Austria-Hungary will have an un-favonrabl^ effect upon the relations between the Slav world and Germany.   Russia,
therefore, for any period that can be foreseen, must be ruled out as a possible friend for Germany.i. &quot; Neither can we count on close relations with France. France, having got the Alsace-Lorraine question settled to her satisfaction, will advance further claims to German territory, either in the form of annexation or in that of a protectorate; The idea of the Rhenish Confederation separates us from France.&quot;5. We have nothing to offer Japan in our present impotence. After the collapse of Russia, Japan is altogether in England&apos;s power.6. &quot; The Power with which it would be easiest for us to get on is the United Stales. Their imaginative ideals are akin to ours. They, in spite of numerous capitalist counter-influences, strive, as a young nation, to redeem the world by establishing social justice.&quot;7. &quot; in the second place after the United States, we have to consider the chances of a partnership with England. It was a blunder to emphasise as we did our opposition to England. We ought to have gone with the stronger, instead of with the weaker. To-day when England is delivered, for as far ahead as it can see, from any fear of political or economic injury from the side of Germany, England has a strong interest in keeping Germany as a good customer, especially in view of the increasing American competition. That English capital should take a notable share in German industrial concerns is to be welcomed. German good workmanship (&apos;Tuchtigkeit&apos;) will secure Germany against becoming economically England&apos;s slave, especially if we succeed in promoting such industries as do not depend on foreign raw materials. One pre-condition of any association with England would be that we should have to construe the principle of the freedom of the seas in a sense which did not expose the unity of the world-wide British Empire to any risk; otherwise such a policy would be simply our old naval policy over again, its effect would only be to make England our bitter enemy.&quot;8. &quot; In the sense just explained the Anglo-Saxon fellowship between England and the United States would have to be widened into a Teutonic bond of mutual assurance.&quot;9. &quot;The Mittel-Europa idea in its old form was a mistake because it failed to allow for the rottenness of Austria-Hungary. But it was right in recognising the necessity of economic concentration in the life of States. If all small nations attain complete sovereignty for their several little States, the principle of self-determination will make for the fall, and not for the rise, of nations. Smaller nations must for their own sake seek inclusion in* some larger complex, preserving cultural autonomy we need to recognise degrees in the right of self-determination. The nationalities established round about the Danube will be led by their common economic interests to join together, to form some kind of Austria-Hungary in a new form a fellowship of free Danubian peoples. These peoples would have a great economic interest in maintaining friendly relations with Germany, and Germany would have an equal interest in maintaining friendly relations with them.&quot;10. The temporary antagonism of the Central-European Slavs to Germanism makes any Mittel-Eurupa an impossibility for the present. The only immediately feasible scheme is that of the German Austrians entering the German Realm (&quot; Reich &quot;) as a federated State. This is necessary for us for the sake of the Kidtur in which the whole German race is interested. It presupposes the re-establishment of political order in Germany.11. A German Austria federally united to us would constitute a bridge to the Central-European.Slavs, i.e., to the future Danubian Federation. German Austria thus leads to the future Alittel-Europa. Some kind of Mittel-Europa is needed as a dyke against the dangerous pressure of increasing Slav populations. The Nearer East, however, cannot, for as far ahead as we can see, form any factor in the Mittel-Europa idea.(C.) Colonies, Oversea Trade.1. If Germany develops all its cultural forces, it has a right to claim a share in developing the backward parts of the earth proportionate to its cultural power. If the League of Nations is a reality, it will have to assert the right of all civilised nations to have colonies. Especially must Germany not be passed over in the new partition of Africa.2. As a manufacturing State Germany needs foreign markets. This gives Germany a right to oversea trade. If the League of Nations is a reality, the supply of raw materials must be regulated by international agreement, the most-favoured-nation clause
must be made general, and there must be universal freedom of trade. This means; that the freedom of the seas must be recognised, always provided that account is taken of the special necessities of England.0 .       ., .      -.(D.) G&amp;rmam in Foreign Countries.1. Emigration from Germany on a large scale is inevitable under the hard-economic conditions of the near future.   Germany must take systematic steps to maintain iii Germans overseas interest in the new free, non-militarist, non-bureaucratic Germany.-, All Germans desiring to find a home in the new Germany, whether individuals or whole peoples, like the German Austrians, must be welcomed. .....2. The return of Germans from abroad-would be impossible apart from a largely conceived scheme of settling men on the land. Such schemes, by bringing population back from the big cities to the country, would promote the health of the community and make Germany more able to feed herself.(E.) Reforms in Education,1. International Societies may well maintain touch with foreign States arid peoples. But such societies must see their task, much more than they did in the old days, in enabling the several national cultures to exchange their good things. Such societies in. the past have mixed far too much in high politics.2. It must be a regular part of education to give a knowledge of foreign countries. When the young are trained to appreciate the differences between the spirit and institutions of Germany and those of foreign countries, their German feeling (&quot; Deutschgefuhl &quot;) will be strengthened, whilst, on the other hand, the tendency to chauvinistic exaggerations will be corrected.3. The&apos; young German must also be given an intelligent knowledge of his own country and its different stocks. He must be educated to know his country&apos;s dignity. &quot;Others will respect us only when we respect ourselves.&quot;4. A knowledge of Germany implies a knowledge of the great personalities in the national history. Democracy must not suppress all hero-worship. Only by regard for the free and strong personality does democracy give scope to the rise of the man good at his job (&quot; Aufsteig cles Tuchtigen.&quot;). Eor our home reconstruction, no less for out-foreign policy, we need before all else great men to lead us.5. The diplomatic service must be reformed by applying the principle of aristocratic selection (picking the best men) on a democratic basis.o
