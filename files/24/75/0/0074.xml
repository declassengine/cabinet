It will be of interest to the Cabinet to read Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s letter, written more than a year before the Armistice. It will be seen that he forecasted accurately the state of indiscipline and disorganization which would arise in the Army if pivotalism, i.e., favouritism, were to rule in regard to the discharge of men.Careful consideration of all the facts brought before me convinces me that the introduction of pivotalism has been an entirely wrong principle and was only arrested in time to prevent the general demoralization of the Army.I am also extremely doubtful of its beneficial effects on industry. The 188,000 miners who were combed out of the Army with such rapidity in front of men with three wound stripes and long service have apparently come home to threaten to hold up the economic revival by a general strike.The real need has not been the combing out of pivotals, but a rapid demobilization of a large part of the Army.   This is now being accomplished.Out of 200,000 requests for pivotals received from the Re-settlement Department, it is claimed by that department that only 33,000 have been identified as returned But this is obviously absurd. One-third of the Army has been demobilized, and there is no reason to suppose that that third does not contain one-third of the pivotals. There is no reason to suppose that that third is not just as fertile in pivotals as any other part. Assuming that this one-third tiiat has been demobilized contains one-third of the pivotals asked for, 70,000 and not 8fofr6fl/pivotals must have reached their destination.However, enormous efforts have been made to comb out the pivotals, regardless of its effect upon the Army, and it is, therefore, fair to assume that the number of pivotals in the first third of the Army to be demobilized far exceeds the number of pivotals in the whole Army. A moderate estimate of the number of pivotals who have already reached home is probably well over 100,000.My conclusion is that there is nothing in pivotalism which would not have been secured substantially by a rapid and efficient demobilization according to age classes and length of service. This would have given the greatest satisfac-tion to the Army and would have released large numbers of men very rapidly to private life, among whom would have been found very large numbers of pivotals.It is surprising that the Commander-in-Chiefs prescient warnings were utterly ignored, and the Army left to be irritated and almost convulsed by a complicated artificial system open at every point to suspicion of jobbery and humbug.W.

SECRET.  ,:-r7: can??&quot; A.G./E./8/5.122144From Field-Marshal Sir D. Haig, K.T., G.C.B., G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., Commander-in-Chief, British Armies in France, to the Secretary, War Ojfce, London.General Headquarters, 1st Echelon,Sir, 3rd October, 1917.I have the honour to bring to the notice of the Army Council that since this Office Letter No. A.G./C./68, dated 15th March, 1917, was written, considerable time and thought have been expended in a study of the important and intricate subject of demobilization.Prior to that date it was not found possible to do more than give the matter a comparatively perfunctory review, but now that details have been gone into and investigated it has been found that the procedure outlined in the War Office scheme of demobilization (interim report) possesses certain serious difficulties, while the principle on which the scheme itself is based is open to grave objection if a well regulated and disciplined departure from France is to be carried into effect.2. Prior to formulating any scheme for demobilization applicable to this theatre of war, it is desirable that the conditions that will obtain on declaration of peace should be clearly depicted in one&apos;s mind.Immediately hostilities cease we must be prepared for a general relaxation of the bonds of discipline ; men&apos;s minds, energies and thoughts will no longer be occupied by the task of defeating and destroying the enemy, but will trend naturally towards early return home, the establishment or reconstruction of business or other kindred matters.Hence as soon as demobilization commences a feeling of jealousy will arise, men will keenly watch the dates of departure of others and will institute comparisons as to their respective claims, there will be generally an unsettled state, and as the natural consequences of a prolonged and arduous war, nerves will be in an irritable and unstable condition. We have, therefore, to realise that the temper of the troops during this period will be a factor not to be lightly disregarded, but it must be equally recognized that this state of mind is natural and only to be expected.If to this are added the facts that martial law will no longer be in force, that the French and Belgians will be demobilizing, that thousands of French and Belgian soldiers will be returning to their families, to their homes and farms in which British troops have been and still are billetted,- that each man will claim the right to till his land whether occupied by British troops or not, that factory buildings will be required and will not be available as at present for the accommodation of British troops, and that the efforts of the French and Belgian Governments will be directed to the early repatriation and reconstruction of the areas in occupation of the various armies, then some of the difficulties that have to be faced can be realised. Under these circumstances the presence of the British troops must be a hindrance and obstruction to the endeavours of both these nations, and it is only natural that our early evacuation of the two countries will be earnestly desired. Friction and jealousy, both national and individual, are likely to result if any delay in departure occurs, and it is contrary to reasonable expectations to imagine that either nation will be prepared to find further accommodation or land for encampments than that which the British forces are occupying at the conclusion of the war.It, is obvious too, that under the most favourable circumstances, demobilization is liable to lead to regrettable lapses from discipline, and that the fullest use of the existing military machinery, together with the whole-hearted co-operation of all ranks, is essential if sucn lapses are to be reduced to a minimum.If then, while working to its best advantage the present efficient military organiza-tion, we can only expect to carry out demobilization with the greatest of difficulty, what can be expected from any system that contemplates an entire breaking up of this organization ? Not only will the high traditions of the British Army most assuredly suffer but our present excellent relations with the two Allies concerned will be seriously jeopardized.I can only contemplate with the gravest anxiety any system of demobilization which will only allow the fullest use to be made of the powers now at our disposal, and(B19/120)   60   2/19   H&amp;S   6892-two
the only system which will ensure this is demobilization by complete formations and units. It seems to me so imperative that nothing should be done to injure the name of the British troops in the eyes of our Allies that every nerve should be strained to ensure an expeditious and well disciplined departure from France and from Belgium.3. I am fully aware of the view that the economic need of the country may indicate the manner of demobilization, and I realize the force of this argument, but it appears to me that the disciplinary side of the question in its widest sense has perhaps not been sufficiently considered, and that this side is fraught with gr^ve issues, both during and after demobilization, no one I think will deny. If discipline, wrought now to a large extent by association in the battlefield, is to be strained to breaking point, the effect during the period of demobilization will not only be grave, but will I feel convinced react most injuriously afterwards on the nation.If this point of view has. been considered, weighed and put aside in favour of the commercial aspect then I can only regret the decision, but I desire now to bring this view most prominently to notice so as to ensure that it shall not fail to obtain the serious consideration it deserves.4. It must not be forgotten that under enlistment on a voluntary basis the Army was composed of men imbued with a spirit of self-sacrifice and patriotism, but under the Military Service Act a leaven of men whose desire to serve their country is negligible has permeated all ranks. The influence of these men and their antecedents generally are not such as to foster any spirit, but that of unrest and discontent, they came forward under compulsion and they will depart from the Army with relief. Men of this stamp are not satisfied with remaining quiet, they come from a class which likes to air real or fancied grievances, and their teaching in this respect is a regrettable antidote to the spirit of devotion and duty of the earlier troops. To combat influences of this nature the only solution is to retain formed units, whose tone is healthy and whose spirit is wholesome, for so long a time as is practicable. This is best for the Army and would best serve the interests of the nation if factors other than commerce and trade are to be considered.If the departure of the troops were based on tlie length of service of a formation with an overseas force, the equity of this arrangement would appeal to all civil and military alike. Trade unions might raise objections but would recognise, I feel sure, the justice of the decision.In the War Office scheme for demobilization nothing is shown as to the methods to be adopted in the case of the overseas Dominion troops or for the numbers of coloured labour now employed out here. In the case of the former it would be satisfactory if assurance could be given that the methods of demobilization will conform closely to that obtaining for troops proceeding to the United Kingdom, and that the speed of despatch will not compare unfavourably; in the case of the latter it is obvious that the terms of the various contracts must be rigidly adhered to if an accusation of mnla fides is to be avoided. I mention these two points, for any general scheme of demobilization depends so largely on shipping facilities that unless all the factors are viewed together, preference may be unwittingly given to that portion immediately under review, to the detriment and probable alteration of whatever schemes is ultimately formulated.In connection with the oversea Dominion troops it must not be overlooked that leave facilities to the Colonies have been practically nil, and that any delay in return-as compared with the despatch of troops to the United Kingdom may cause a feeling of dissatisfaction and resentment, while the attitude of the French Government towards any lengthy retention of British colonial troops, together with the disciplinary aspect of the matter, cannot be ignored.The further advantages of a comprehensive scheme of demobilization by formations  i.e., including oversea Dominion troops and coloured labour-are that dates of departure can be approximately estimated and full use made of the intervening period. Formations and units complete can be employed on definite tasks, e.g., salvage work, collection of stores, custody of horses, &amp;c, and large economies effected in this manner.5. As regards the practical difficulties to the War Office scheme as at present outlined. This scheme is based upon the necessity for a rapid reconstruction of the civil and commercial life of the United Kingdom, and hence anticipates the gradual dissolution-tion of military formations into a mass of individuals whose date of repatriation is to be decided solely by trade classification without any consideration being accorded to length of military service overseas. Method &quot; B&quot; of the scheme and this will probably be the method adopted-contemplates the compilation of a complex return showing the trades of all troops in France and the intended place of residence by certain defined
areas. The success of the scheme depends to a large extent on the accuracy of this return ; but when it is realized that many thousands of men will have to be detached from units to take charge of horses, to collect and handle stores of all kinds, &amp;c, the value of this return is considerably discounted. It will not be possible to release these men until the various tasks are completed. There will also be certain complications in regard to the release of Royal Army Medical Corps personnel in hospitals. Moreover, there is, too, the possible contingency of an army of occupation having to be maintained.The main obstacle ot the scheme lies, however, in. the proposal that all sorting, sifting and shuffling of personnel is to be undertaken in France. This proposal seems to me impracticable. Briefly it amounts to the collection and the sorting in divisional, army and lines of communication areas of all men into industrial groups and places of residence and their despatch to certain pre-arranged ports in France.As many hundreds of thousands of men are concerned the cross country journeys involved preparatory to the actual homeward journey will be intricate and numerous. The railways could not guarantee to undertake these moves, while by road the length of time taken, coupled with the difficulties of supply and accommodation, render moves of any length by this manner practically impossible. We have to consider the French as well; as stated above the demobilization of the French Army and the.reconstruction of normal peace life will be in progress, railways and roads will hence also be required for French purposes, while the facilities existing will not be adequate to deal with French needs as well as ours under the proposed demobilization scheme. In a lesser degree the above points are also applicable to Belgian territory where rapid reconstruction will equally be in progress.It is clear to me that if the scheme for demobilization is to be based on the economic needs of the United Kingdom and piecemeal methods resorted to some alteration in the present proposals is necessitated. It will I am convinced not be possible to undertake the sorting of the men in France, the railways cannot be retained for our exclusive use, and though the attitude of the French Government towards the scheme as a whole has not been ascertained, yet it is doubtful if they would acquiesce to our retaining accommodation and ground over and above that necessary for the use of the troops in their formations and units in their positions at the conclusion of the war.The necessary sorting under the scheme must I feel sure be undertaken in England where no other nation need be consulted as to the acquisition of land and the use of railways and land.Another, but less serious, objection to the scheme is that the machinery to regulate the collection and despatch of men cannot well be constructed while active operations are in progress. To earmark beforehand the staff for certain tasks is not practicable, as this all depends on the situation of formations on the declaration of peace, while it is clearly objectionable to divert the attention of staffs of formations from their present duty viz., the vigorous prosecution of the war to matters connected with events after hostilities have ceased, while the whole scheme depends for its success on the rapidity with which the necessary arrangements for the despatch of the men can be made.None of these difficulties would be apparent if demobilization were to occur by complete units and formations; . the latter would proceed to the various ports of departure direct from positions at conclusion of war, and embarkation would be super-vised by the staffs and officers known to the men.I have touched lightly upon the reasons that render the scheme outlined by the War Office difficult to put into effect, but there is one other aspect which I feel constrained to put forward, and that is, while demobilization by formations renders it possible to meet&apos;any unforeseen military situation at once, demobilization piecemeal will prove the reverse.6. Finally, if it is decided that no alteration can be effected in the principle on which the scheme for demobilization is based viz., withdrawal by selected trades  then I would urge that the present scheme be so modified as to admit of despatch of the men from the nearest available port, and I would suggest for consideration that this could be well effected by the grant to each man of one month&apos;s furlough, the issue to him of a proportion of his pay, with orders that he shall report personally at conclusion of his furlough at a dispersal or other selected station in the area in which he resides, unless in the meantime he has obtained employment, when report by post would suffice.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   13. HAIG, Field-Marshal, Commander-in- Chief, British Armies in France.
