The scheme failed:     partly because Shinwell, Kirkwood, Gallagher and Muir,&apos;were too successful at the outset, and were led to believe their influence stronger than it is, and oalled out the Electricians in London when the Glasgow strike was actually waning, and partly because the Government dealt firmly with the rioters.    It is now known that during the disorder on Friday,, 31st January, the intention was to seize the Municipal buildings in Glasgow, but the police were too strong for them.The Revolutionary minority cannot hope to oall.a strike without a colourable pretext, and they seized upon the 40 hours week as a remedy for unemployment. They do not at all realize how great a body of public opinion there is in all classes in favour of law and order, but they do realize that they are organized and the steady-going people are not.     The time will surely come when we shall be forced to enrol some sort of Civic Guard to keep order in the streets, as has recently been done in Holland and Switzerland.     In tho state of public feeling in London at this moment the response to such a call would be surprising.The, new Defence of the,Realm Regulation, bringing striken at Power Stations into line with those in Gas Works: and Water Works, was enacted on Wednesday, and on Thursday arrangements were made for the arrests of the strike leaders and charges were framed on which they would have to. appear at Bow Street on Friday morning, but very few men came out, in fact not enough to justify police action. It is a peculiarity of strike leaders that they talk very bravely on the platform of their wish to be arrested and prosecuted and of the immunity they enjoy through the fear of the lovernment to try conclusions with persons of such public import-anoe, but when they know their arrest is impending their courage appears to evaporate.    *t was so with Stavenhagen, Webb and Muir, and the strike of the Electrical Trades Union did not take place.    On Friday afternoon there was a secret meeting of the Shop Stewards of the Power Stations, in which by a large majority, (37 to 7) a resolution was passed against a strike.      Stavenhagen, Muir and Y/ebb, and a man named Bolton from Sootland, made a passionate protest.    Muir said he was &quot;fed up&quot; and the men would go back to serfdom and would lose all they had gained;   that he had made arrangements to go to gaol under the Regulation. He was much disappointed and was done with the Power Station men, because they had let him down.     ^tavenhagen said that his health was shattered with working for
- z *their benefit and he would now resign.    They then left the meeting in a rage. A resolution was passed to demand from the Executive Council the names of the persons responsible for the issue of the notices to oease work, as the Shop Stewards wished to have thera punished.    At a meeting of the delegates at Manchester yesterday, at which Stavenhagen waB present, it was decided to take a&apos;ballot of the members of the Electrical Trades Union as to whether they would strike for a 40 hours week or not.    This will shelve the question of a strike for the present,The &quot;Hands Off Russia&quot; meeting at the Albert Hall yesterday was not a success.    The top gallery was empty and there were vacant seats all over the hall.    Fairchild was in the Chair,    Weil ^oLean movod the resolution and said that Glasgow. Municipality proveked the strike in order to bring in the military. He was going to expose the whole plot.    He said ho had a photograph showing an assault upon Kirkwood by a Police Sergeant.    Valentine McEmtee, of Walthamstow, bewailed the fact that A.S.E. drivers, though Trades Unionists, had &quot;black-legged&quot; the Tubes.    The audienoe cheered him, but when the meeting was over they rushed for the &quot;black-leg&quot; motor lorries, and the &quot;class consoious socialist&quot; was to be seen fighting his brothers for a seat.    Sylvia Pankhurst oalled for Revolution in this&apos; country and suggested that Edward Saermus, the Bolshevik violinist who is about to be deported, should be taken by force out of Brixton. Mrs Sheehy Skeffington made a violent speech about the death of her husband, and John &amp;*Lean made his usual incendiary oration.    After that the audience began to &quot;thin.    A large number consisted of Yiddish-speaking Russian Jews,THE RAILWAY STRIKE.Mr. Bromley rather cleverly used the grievance that was likely to appeal t* all his members, when he called out the motor men and hocmotive Engineers,It may be remembered that in my daily report of 30th January I intimated that there was a conspiracy to produce a &quot;lightning strike&quot; on the Railways during the first week in February, but this abortive strike may now have deferred the danger.    When it takes place it is to be hoped that the Government will find it possible to leave the dispute to be thrashed out by the companies and the men, without intervening.    At the most, it is not likely that the strike vtiM last more than five days, at the present high cost of living,Last week documentary evidence was received in support of the view expressed in my last report, that the German Government was playing with Bolshevism in the hope *f passing it on westward.    &quot;To subdue our deadly enemies, England and * ranee-, by spreading it amongst the ranks of their ariaiea with the hope that the German Lion may re-awaken,&quot;    (A copy of these documents Is enclosed in this report).    On the othor hand, an agent just returned from Berlin after an interview with von Strauss, director of the Oeutsche Bank, is oonvinoed that the German Government has a genuine desire to fight Bolshevism, since the fate of Europe is involved, and that the German authorities would detail German trobps to fight with English and American troops against Bolshevism,    This agent is convinced that no German organisation, g.)vernment or otherwise, Is promoting Bolshevism against the Entente countries.    It is impossible to reconcile these statements with the documents referred to, unless the
explanation is that the German Government has undergone a change of heart during the last few weeks owing to the real progress of Bolshevism,t   Though we have as yet no indisputable evidence that foreign money is being oiroulated in this country in support of revolutionary strikes, several faots may be quoted in support of this belief.     The Police are now endeavouring to trace two mysterious Swedos, .who were overheard to discuss their part in the reoent strike.       movement and the amount of money that they had to pay for it.    We have received private information that Stavenhagen has reoeived  500 from Russia for the purpose of propaganda.    He is said to have flourished a bundle of notes at the Shop Stewards&apos; meeting at the Lord Street Cafe, Manchester, three weeks ago, saying that he was prepared to spend them in organising an unofficial Workers&apos; Committee among the Cotton Workers of Oldham.    A man named James Reynolds has just returned to South Wales (l, Cross Street, Ynyshir),where he is following no occupation except fostering the Bolshevik movement, and yet, from some unknown source he is in possession of funds.The Bolshevik Organisation in Stockholm claims to have.lately succeeded in getting several agents through to England.     They believe that England is a fertile ground for their propaganda.During the meeting of the N.U.R. yesterday at King&apos;s Hall, Birmingham, a member stood up and shouted, &quot;German money is paying for all this, and we, the Britishers, ought not to stand it1?.   There was a chorus of &quot;Hear, hear&quot; and the sense of the audience appeared to be against the strikers,,REST AMONG SOLDIERS,.&apos;i&apos;he reoent indiscipline among the men returning to France from leave seems to have no connection with the Revolutionary movement.     There is, however, evidence to show that agitators have been busy among soldiers.      As late as the 6th February, Stannard, late sergeant of the A.S.C., came with a civilian not yet identified to the Y.M-.CA. Club in Eccleston Square and began&apos; to address the men. He claimed to have been the organiser of the disturbances at Folkestone, and to have been sent by Captain E.S. Donisthorpo of the Sailors &amp; Soldiers&apos; Union, in response to the invitation of a man named Siffleet of the R.A.F. at the instance of the &quot;Herald&quot; newspaper.     The speeches made by these men were very inflammatory, sty much so that the manager of the Club turned them out.     &quot;if you men in uniform will combine with the workers, we will then be the strongest party in the country &quot; One of the soldiers present said, &quot;You are running a great risk,&quot;     He replied, &quot;i don&apos;t care if they were armed with machine guns&quot;.     About 600 soldiers were present.Among the persons frequenting the London Workers&apos; Committee in 7, Featherstone Buildings, High Holborn, is Sapper 144181 James Henderson Porteous, of the Royal Engineersc     Before the war this man was a sorting clerk and -telegraphist at the G.P.O. Glasgow, and since enlistment he has been employed at the Army Letter Office, 1, King Edward&apos;s Buildings. G.P,0,     It is possible that to him. or srune other man of similar views, the revolutionary literature which has been found from time to time in Army letter bags, may be attributed.
IRELAND.The strike at Belfast was engineered from Glasgow, and now shows sign3 of collapsing,     It has been singularly free from disorder.    Wo settlement has yet been reached, though conferences are sitting almost fontinuoualy.    The polioe think that the time has nftw arrived fns drastic action by the Government to restore the workings of the trams, gas and elootricity.    Three of the largo unions affected by the strike (namely, the General Workers&apos; Uniony. the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, and the Electricians&apos; Union) are now paying strike pay, but their dependants are suffering acutely.    Sink Fein is undoubtedly losing ground, but the power is passing into the hands of far abler and more dangerous Labour agitators of the type of John Connolly, who are not easily distinguished from anarchists.There is a rumour in Copenhagen that the Bolsheviks are hoping to introduce propaganda agents into Ireland by submarine.HQ-OOHSORIPTIOH FELLOWSHIP,At a conference at Devonshire House, Bishops gate, on January 25th, Ammon gave the following statistics about Conscientious ubjootors:-Court-Martialled......     , *, 5645Discharged on medical grounds,,,   441Become mentally affected       ...    54Oourt-Martialled since the Armistice ,,,     ,,,     ...    78At the same meeting the notorious W.F. Y/atson (who is not a member) said, &quot;Glasgow will be out on Monday and London shortly afterwards,    I anticipate that the railway men will bo out on February 7th or 8th and all other sections are in such a state of unro3t that there will be a complete stoppage by.the end of February,    When the strike has become general we propose to set up Revolutionary Councils and National Committees tl challenge the right of the Government to govern the country,&quot;    Like the other agitators, he professes anxious to be arrested, as it will give a fillip to the revolutionary movement. As an illustration of the kind of man who engineers a revolutionary strike, it may be mentioned that Watson was until recently furnishing information, for payment, to the Polioe, but he was so drunken and untrustworthy that his oommunicatiens were discredited.     The leaders of the tfo-Conscription Fellowship told a correspondent that there would shortly be a revolution in England and that the House of Commons would be stormed by a mob,     The correspondent was recommended to get in plenty of food, as it would be difficult to obtain,NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES.This body is holding its annual meeting on February 22nd and is planning a campaign for March 2nd, but their strong appeal for funds seems to show that public support is falling off.BRITISH SOCIALIST PAR$Y,A meeting of the B.S.P. was held on the 2nd February, with W.F. Watson in the chair and Ex-Inspector Syme on the platform.    It was decided to form
a ceuncil of fifteen to act as the main Strike Committee;   to make the &quot;Hands of Off Russia&quot; CommitteeSjinto Distriot Soviets;   to seduce the loyalty of the Police and Military;   and to form a Strikers&apos; Police Force,    They also decided to stop the circulation of the &quot;Morning Post&quot; as from Tuesday next, because it had said that Yiddish was spoken at a recent Workers&apos; Conference.     The official head-quarters of the Trades Unions are to be taken over, by force if necessary.From Southampton comes the news that mechanics in the repairing yards have approached troops landing from France, during the breakfast interval, and spoken to them on labour matters,    On the 3rd instant Scottish troops were approached and illustrations of the Glasgow strike were shown to them.    The matter has been reported to the Military authorities,&quot;HANDS OFF RUSSIA&quot; COMMITTEE,A pamphlet, &quot;The Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot;, published by the London Workers&apos; Committee and printed by T, Kealy, of 47, Darnley Road, Haokney, is being distributed gratis in the East End,    It is a protest against Allied intervention in Russia, in the usual terms,THE WORKERS&apos; UdlQii.I,F. Watson has brought out tho first number of &quot;The Masses&quot;.&apos;   He asked the writers of the articles in this number to make then &quot;red hot&quot;, but they were evidently afraid of the consequences and the articles are comparatively mild. In Watson1s own article he says that the soldiers at certain garages are cn strike, and that efforts are being made to extend the strike to all garages throughout the country.&apos;LIVERPOOL.The &quot;rebels&quot; in Liverpool are doing their best to induce the workers to support the Clyde and Belfast strikes, but without success.    Among the steady men it is felt that as trouble must come it is better that it should come now than later, when the &quot;rebels&quot; might he better organised.     They say that there will be no peace in the labour world until they have been defeated and that as soon as the workers find that they have been induced to strike and lose wages, without gaining anything, the extremists will be entirely discountenanced.Stavenhagen has made big efforts to foment trouble amongst the Cotton:workers, but they are staunch to their trade union leaders.     The Independent Labour Party have done very little, and this appears to be because John McLean of Glasgow drew so large an audience that they did not think it worth while to hold meetings with less attractive speakers.    They realise that Liverpool is not yet ready for revolution, and they hope to get McLean to speak again.    McLean also spoke at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, and at Barrow, Workington and Whitehaven, on the usual lines, saying that he had been drugged in prison;   that the capitalists must be swept away this year, and that if there were bloodshed in.the process it would not be the fault.of the workers.    When asked a question which he cannot answer he accuses the questioner of being a police spy, and the audience then becomes menacing.    Ho plays this trick at all his meetings.    On the other hand, people came away from all his meetings at Barrow saying that his gospel was too extreme for Englishmen, and expressing surprise that he is allowed *ut of prison,*
f of he ought ,to be ,in prison or in a lunatic asylum.    The same impression &apos; waa produced on,his audience at Manchester.My correspondent reports that Lord Leverhulme is doing much harm by his public utterances about a sax hour day for workers and motorcars for working men, etc.    The agitators turn these expressions to their own use on the platform. .NOTTINGHAM. &apos;   .My Nottingham correspondent reports that the trade union officials in his area are hoping that strong measures will be taken by the Government against the extremists, who threaten to ruin old fashioned trade unionism. On the other hand, the membership of the Workers&apos; Union has grown in four years from 250 to 10,000 members,-with some thirty- branches in Leicester-shire,The Nottingham branch of the Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, who unsuccessfully ran a candidate for the Eastern Division of the city, are becoming very restless and their speeches are sometimes on the verge of being revolutionary.     Their principal grievance is the inadequacy of pensions in comparison with&quot; the present high cost of living.     The membership is now 7,500.LEEDS.My Leeds correspondent speaks of the state of alarm, bordering on panic, whioh is to be found among the ordinary business men, . Ho says that the Pacifist agitators who wore so active&apos;a few months ago do not appear to be taking any part in the present Revolutionary agitation.Newcastle-ON-TYNE.Though there has been little activity on the part of the &quot;Rebels&quot; in Northumberland recently. Alderman James Dunlop, of 4, Dean.Terrace,^ South Shields, the local secretary of the Drillers1 Society, has been making kim-iself conspicuous.     In speaking to strikers ho said, *The boys have learnt to shoot now: they will know what to do when they come home&quot;.     nI will die fighting the employers&quot;.     Dunlop takes an active part in the Shop Stewards&apos; movement.The firm action taken by the Government at Glasgow has impressed working men&apos;s opinion in Newcastle,    My correspondent has heard them say, &quot;it is time the Government did do something like this;   they have got what they deserve; we don&apos;t want the Bolsheviks to rule&quot;, and so on.    These expression have been used by men actually on strike at the moment.*&apos;BIRMINGHAM.The &quot;Rebels&quot; in Birmingham have been vory active, during the past fort-night, in attempting to create a strike for a 40 hours week, but they have failed.FRANCE,There has been a serious decline in French civilian morale during the past fortnight and it is believed in Paris that serious labour disturbances&apos;
at an early date must be expected.     This is due, primarily, to the high cost of living, and profiteering, against whioh the Government have been very slow to act.    The first to suffer has been the ill-paid Civil Servant, and this class is now honey-combed with disaffection,     It has been noticed that the feelings of civilians towards the soldiers has lately undergone a change; the soldier is no longer the public Idol, he is traated with indifference, if not with animosity.   &apos; Strikes are pending within the next two weeks; they will only add to the public discontent.    With all this the popularity of M, Clomenceau is waning, and at a recent meeting of railway workers a speaker went so far as to say that if M. Calllaux had had his way there would have been no war,,., Anti-American feeling is said to be growing in Paris and in Rouen. This is due, no doubt, to the arrogant and noisy demeanour of individual Americans and to the large number of offences committed by them.    Parisians object to the policing of their streets by American Military Police.     There is also a growing feeling in Paris, in which Americans themselves appear to share, that President Wilson&apos;has outstayed his&apos;welcome.SWITZERLAND. - .Details of the .Belshevik plot in Switzerland are now pretty Well known.     The notorious Grinm was to establish himself as dictator and a Soviety Government would have been established under him.     The Bolsheviks are still organising and carrying on propaganda among .the troops.     They speak of a fresh attempt at revolution at the end of the winter, when propaganda will have made greater progress,Mr. Henderson is much disappointed at the failure of the conference at Berne, but he says-that he cannot confess it publicly. He thinks that the permanent commission will include Mr, Ramsay Macdonald.There is a report from an Italian source that the General Strike will be declared between March 20th and March 25th,     This will be the occasion for the attempt at a Social Revolution which the Swiss Government are anticipating.     It appears that Madame Balabanoff, the Bolshevik organiser, has been in Zurich for two or three weeks, having secured from the police an extraordinary promise, permis de sejjur, for three months.     She is said to be under the protection of the Federal Councillor Muller, Chief of the Department of Justice of the Police,ITALY.At the reoent Socialist Conference at Milan the extremists carried all before them;   they passed a.resolution in favour of a Socialist Republic, to be established by a proletarian revolution, but they agreed that the time was not yet ripe,RUSSIA.Djanjuishuan, the leader of Chinese Bolshevik propaganda in the Far East, and president of the Chinese section of the Communist Party, was killed
COPY, MUNSTER,HA2/1918.Striotly Secret.TO ALL HEAD, AftENTS LEFT OF THE RHINE. $Arising out oi the Conference held on the 2nd December. 1918, we give you herewith once more the guiding principles for the work we nave to do.    As has been repeatedly pointed out, the first thing is to make it clear to the population there that Bolshevism does not constitute the serious danger to Germany which it is largely considered to be.in Moscow when about to address a meeting.    The report of the aofiatftanation is dated 6th February,    This man exercised a sort of dictatorship over the Chinese in Russia, and his death may have far reaching effects,DENMARK.The Government is getting rid of Surita, the Bolshevik minister, and eight members of the Legation staff , but this,, is only one-third of the Bolsheviks whom the police recommended $or expulsion,NORWAY.The Government has, induced three Bolshevik propagandists to proceed to Russia with ^orovskl and Litvinoff, without resorting to expulsion.ROUMANIA.The position in Roumania is reported to be very danpeyous.    The peasants are threatened with starvation and they are greedily absorbing Bolshevik principles.    The railways have almost entirely broker, down,HOLLAND,$psians in Holland suspected of Bolshevik propaganda atfjg now being in- -terned, with a view to ultimate repatriation,    Bankers have been confidential! aeked tc report,to-Minister of Justice suspicious monetary transactions. The frontiers are being carefully watched, so far as. their wide extent permits,BOLSHEVIKS &amp; THE PEACE CONFERENCE,, From an Italian source it is said that, should the Russian Bolsheviks not be received at the Peace Conference, they intend- to attempt to bribe- the guard at the Peace palace and place a bomb there to explode the building.    Madame Balabanoff is paid to have brought this order.    She is also said to be introducing Bolshevik propaganda into Northern Italy.BOLSHEVIK ENGLISH &amp; FRENCH1,In consequence of Mr, Phillips Price having described himself in hia pro-Bolshevik pamphlets as Correspondent of the ^Manchester Guardian1&quot;, the editor has written to him, dismissing him from all conpeotion with the paper.    The jle-tt-er was mild in tone, but quite firm.Besides Price, the French report that an Englishman named Rowlands is starting a Bolshevik jioademy, ostensibly for teaching English and French, on - capital supplied by the Government.    Gaptain Sadoul is to assist him and %s jshortly expected to be in Berlin.B.H.T.
16th January, 1919,Z.d. Acten 1321 B.SECRET.All head Agents are notified that reports on the preparatory work, giving as oomplete details as possible of activities and success obtained,, are to be rendered to the A.K.3. by 21st of this month, and I hope that all will be so far oomplete and that all posts will be able to give proofs of their powers,(Signed) CAPTAIN KANSTEIN,COPY.Herr Hauptmann Kanstein, MUHSTER,In reply to yours of 16th instant under z,d, Acten 1321 B.E. I beg to inform you as followsUp to to-day the result of our work has been that great dissatisfaction and, in some instances, autiny, have arisen amongst the Belgian troops of occupation here, and in consequence, desertion is the order of the day.I have taken some of these people into my pay and to-day received a report from one of them that on Saturday next a Meeting for the propagation of Bolshevism is to be held in BRUSSELS.    I shall be present at this meeting. Our work is now mtioh easier as the civilian population are aiding us in every possible way.CREFELD.20th January, 1919.The German power of resistance is still firmly rooted.    Its strength ie composed of the Bourgeoisie, the Intellectuals, the middle classes (Burgertum) and an overwhelming majority of the German workmen.It would be possible to destroy German Bolshevism with one stroke,, but -we need Bolshevism in order to subdue our deadly enemies, England and France, by spreading it amongst the ranks of their armies, so that after achieving this end the sleeping German lion may re-awaken.Our next objective, therefore, is to make these plans known to our fellow countrymen.    The latter must then do their share by individual work among the soldiers of the armies of occupation.     Ho effort or cost must be spared in order to gain our secret objeot.  &apos; Here again German energy and organisation must win.    Long live our great German Vaterland.(Signed) KANSTEIN.Captain.
