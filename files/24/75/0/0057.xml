This Document is the Property ofHis Britan i : -&apos; &quot;innent.114Gen. No.6116THE PROGRESS OF BOLSHEVISM IN EUROPE.MEMOEANDUM BY MR. BASIL THOMSON.)Russia.Since my memorandum on Bolshevism in Russia was written early in November, events have moved fast. To the persistent and ably conducted propaganda of the Bolsheviks was partly due the outbreak at Kiel, which precipitated the German request for an armistice, and with the collapse of the German Empire the prospects of sweeping Europe with a wave of Bolshevism became brighter. The Russian Bolsheviks redoubled their efforts, and, as it now appears, the Germans were- quite ready to take the risk of being involved in the flood if by playing with Bolshevism they could send it on its way westward. There have been, therefore, during the last two months two separate streams of propaganda, Russian and German.The Russian Government. There has now been time for considerable organization of the Bolshevik Government. Russia has been divided into four Federal Republics : (1.) Commune of the North. -(2.) Commune of the West.(3.) Central Commune.(4.) Commune ofthe Volga.The first is composed of the Governments of Petrograd, Archangel, Viatka, Vologda, part of the Government of Pskov, Novgorod, Tcherepovetz and Olonetz.   .The second comprises the Governments of Vitebsk, Smolensk and Pskov.The third the Governments of Moscow, Orel, Koursk, Toula, Tver, Nijni-Novgoi od, Voronege.The fourth those of Kazan, Simbirsk, Saratov and Perm.Each town is provided with its Council of Deputies and its Commission for fighting counter-revolution, sabotage and speculation. Each district besides has its Council of Deputies (Sovdep) and its Extraordinary Commission. These institutions direct all local affairs, but they are all subject to the authority of the Central Executive Committee, which sits at Moscow. The pan-Russian Extraordinary Commission against counter-revolution, &amp;c, also sits at Moscow. The members of these bodies are supposed to be elected by the pan-Russian Congress of Workmen, Peasants, Red Guards, Sailors and Cossask Deputies; foreign affairs are under the exclusive management of George Tchitcherine.   The Central Committee is composed as follows : Lenin ... TrotskyTchitcherine   ... Spiez ... Podrovski Lounatcharski NevskiOulianova     ... StoutchkaTziouroupa Bontch-BrouevitchPresident.Military and Naval Commissary. Foreign Affairs. Commissary of Labour.Interior (ex-Professor of History at Moscow). Education.Commissary of Roads  and  Communications.    a former engineer at the Ministry. Lenins wife, social assistant.Justice.   Formerly a Deputy of the  PetrogradTribunal. Minister of Food. Business Manager.The Red Army. On the 25th October, 1918, the Bolshevik troops of Petrograd and the neighbourhood numbered hardly more than two divisions. Regimental committees have been abolished throughout the Army, and the power was tranferred to military commissaries, who were charged with attending to the political morale.(Bl0/113)   60   2/19   H&amp;S   6880-two
The Bolsheviks have neglected no means for increasing the number of their troops. Disabled soldiers of the old Army released from Germany are concentrated on their arrival either at Petrograd or Moscow, and quartered with soldiers of the Red Guard. They are left without clothing, with insufficient rations and without medical attendance, while the Red Guard, with whom they are mingled, is well fed, clothed and amply supplied with money. When they complain, the answer is, &quot; Enrol in the Red. Guard.&quot; Refractory cases are cruelly treated. At the head of the Red Guard is a former colonel of the staff, a Lett named Vatatis. Each soldier receives 300 to 500 roubles a month, equipment, food on a higher scale than all the other categories, and a promise to support his family in the event of death; but in spite of their privileged situation, the Red Guard have not the confidence of the Government, and, as intercepted letters show, many of them are disaffected. The real reliance of the Government is placed in the &quot; International Battalions of the Army,&quot; which are formed of Letts and Chinese, who are used as punitive companies both in the Army and in the interior. In action they are placed behind the Red Guard, ready to fire on them with machine guns, and every unit of the Red Guard knows that its best chance of escaping death is to advance on the enemy. Theoretically, the International Battalions are on an equality with the Red Guard, but actually they are far better paid, and they can count on absolute immunity for the excesses they commit against the wretched civil population which is left at their mercy. The Lettish regiments of this nightmare force are believed to number 10 or 11 divisions, and the Chinese probably two. There is compulsory military instruction in the towns for all men between 17 and 40, in the form of drills twice a week. While its cohesion lasts, the Bolshevik Army is an incontestable force.The Terror. All assemblies except those organised by the Bolsheviks are forbidden in the towns. Anti-Bolshevik meetings are dispersed by armed force and their organisers shot. No Press exists except the Bolshevik Press. The Bolsheviks organise Sunday reunions, in which such subjects as, &quot; Should one enrol in the Red Guards ? &quot; ; &quot; Who will give us our daily bread ?&quot; ; &quot; The world revolution,&quot; &amp;c, are debated.So effective is the Terror that no one dares to engage in anti-Bolshevik propaganda. People have been arrested for a simple telephonic conversation, in which the terms seemed ambiguous or could be interpreted as adverse to the Bolsheviks. An arrest is the prelude to every kind of corruption; the rich have to pay huge exactions to intermediaries, who are usually Jews, before they can obtain their release.Latterly &quot; mass arrests &quot; have come into fashion. It was thought at first that these were ordered by the Extraordinary Commission against counter-revolution, but it is now known that they are ordered by a special Revolutionary Committee called for short &quot; The Three,&quot; because it consists of three members. This committee is independent of the Extraordinary Commission and is controlled only by the Commissary of War.   Persons arrested by its orders have never been seen again.The proceedings of this committee are kept secret; its very compositidn is unknown to the public.It has already been mentioned that the Red Guard is disaffected, An intercepted letter from a sailor named Borzoff, written on the eve of going to the front, says, &quot;&apos; The authorities seem to think that we are going to support the interests of the Soviets, but they are greatly mistaken. All the sailors are otherwise inclined . . . many of them go simply to nvoid hunger. ... I think there will be an end to all this very soon ; the Allies will overpower us.&quot; Another letter from Petrograd says, &quot; We hear that Petrograd, before any other Russian town, will be in touch with Europe, but in the meantime half the inhabitants there are dying from hunger and typhoid fever.&quot; These letters and others were sent by the Russian Censor to the Extraordinary Corn-mission for fighting the counter-revolution, and no doubt the writers have already been dealt with in the usual way.There is, of course, in Russia a public opinion quite outside the Bolsheviks an opinion which longs ardently for any kind of intervention-Allied or German-which will put an end to the present state of anarchy. So far it has expressed itself only in half-hearted insurrections, as for example that of Yaroslav and the assassination of Mirbach, &amp;c. Nevertheless, in spite of the apparent stability of the Bolshevik Govern-ment, in spite of the ineptitude of its opponents, there are signs that the Terrorist Oligarchy is tottering. It is indeed impossible to believe that a Government, financially bankrupt and unable to feed its population, can survive for very long, however drastically it attempts to govern by terror. The Danish Minister in Petrograd said recently that hatred towards the Government and everybody connected with it is spreading among all classes of the population, including peasants and the workingmen. The end will probably come quite suddenly as it did in the French Terror.
The anti-Bolshevik parties are considering all sorts of devices for discrediting the Bolsheviks. One is to flood the country with false currency, in order to throw discredit on the Soviets ; another, to seize the printing office, where bank notes are produced, at Petrograd ; another, to obtain employment in Government offices for the purpose of furnishing information to their Party, which is being conducted&apos; by Boris Asvinkov. Even the working class of the two capitals is divided and there is a considerable anti-Bolshevik party. The general opinion of the educated classes is that a force of half a million would suffice to overthrow the Bolsheviks with very few losses.Bolshevik Administration. One is startled from time to time by hearing that some well known man of education has joined the Bolsheviks, such for instance as Maxim Gorki and the famous singer Chaliapin. The fact is that there are many specious things in the Bolshevik creed designed to capture persons of all shades of opinion. It is not usually with the principles of a system of Government that fault can be found, bat in the application of the principles, and when these applied by ruffians, such as the Terrorists of the French and the Russian Revolutions, the principles fall into ruin. The rose-coloured accounts of the Bolshevik regime, which are appearing in the Manchester Guardian, are written by persons who have only the principles to go by. Take for example the housing question. Some families have more rooms than they can live in, others have to live in one room, others again have no room at all, The Bolshevik Government commandeers a large house and lets it to indigent persons, so that all have equal housing accommodation. The house is managed by a committee and the only person who dislikes the arrangement is the owner of the house. The rationing is another instance. There are four categories. No. 1 entitles those engaged in heavy manual work to f lb. of bread and five herrings a day, and No. 4, the lowest in the scale, giving in fact the right to \ lb. of bread per diem, is prescribed for those who employ other people. No. 4 is a very cogent weapon for persuading people to enlist in the Red Guard or other unpopular occupation.National economy is managed by a Superior Council sitting at Moscow, which nominally administers the industry, exports and imports for the whole country, but, in practice, all industry and commerce being paralysed, it has very little to do. There is food administration in each district, partly under the control of the Food Commissariat and partly under the Council of National Economy. Expeditionary * orps, composed of Volunteers and Red Guards, are used to requisition corn from the peasants, who will not give it willingly because the price is fixed at a lower rate than the cost of production. These expeditionary corps carry away all the food on which they can lay their hands, leaving the peasants what is strictly necessary; it is in fact a kind of organised brigandage. Corps of the same kind exist in the mills and factories with not less than 1,000 employees. The requisition the food necessary for the maintenance of themselves and the factory hands.Much is made among the Bolshevik sympathisers in England of the Bolshevik system of public education, but it is easy to acquire merit for any educational system in a country where there was practically no elementary education before the revolution. It is also true that the opera and the theatres are kept running, but I am assured by the Spanish Charge d&apos;Affaires that the opera performed to an empty house until the Government gave orders that it was to be filled. Such methods of window dressing are not unknown in other countries.The following is a list of prices for foodstuffs and clothing current on the 15th of December : Roubles.Potatoes (mostly rotten)    ...      ...      ...      ...     10   per lb.Salt fish (bad condition) . ...      ...      ...      ...    9-10     ,,Bread (by card, scarce)     ...       ...      ...      ...      1^-      ,,Bread (in open market)     ...      ...      ...      ...   18-20    ,,Pork (scarce) ...      ...      ...      ...      ...     50       ,,Beef (scarce)... .............   22-23Sugar (scarce)        ......      ...      ...      ...     80       ,,Tea (scarce) ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     100      ,,Coffee (none to be had at any price)Butter (salted)       ...      ...      ...       ..      ..,     75       ,,Butter (unsalted)    .,.       ...       ...       ...       ...      80       ,,(The russian pound is 2 oz. lighter than our pound.)Roubles.Suit of clothes (very ordinary)     ...      ...      ... 800-900Shoes (poor quality)...       ...       ...       ...       ...     400Cotton (only by card)       ...      ...      ...      ...   15-16  for a piece 26-in.square.(fi880) A 2
The American reports show that Bolshevism is still a potent force in Siberia and that Bolshevists are in close touch with- those in European Russia.In destroying the fabric of society the Bolshevists appear to be adopting the methods of &quot; skyscrapers &quot; in New York, which is to dig out everything to a depth of 300 ft. in order to erect a new and stable edifice. They have said more than once that unless they can by propaganda induce a sympathetic revolution in other countries their fate must be sealed ; and the fever of propaganda which now possesses them is really a measure of self-preservation.It is now reported that they are abandoning propaganda by leaflets in favour of personal and secret propaganda.Germany.Evidence is accumulating that except in the Hanseatic towns, the Spartacist movement, if not actually under control, can be put down at any moment, and that the old military authorities are designedly allowing it some rppe. In no other way is it possible to explain the fact that the personnel of the old Secret Service is still intact and amply supplied with funds, which are being devoted almost entirety to Bolshevik propaganda in Allied countries. There are no doubt two motives, first to break up the Allies before an indemnity is imposed on Germany, and secondly (though this is conjectural), to produce such a revulsion of feeling among the bourgeosie that a restoration of the monarchy might become possible.On the other hand it is quite clear that the old respect shown to officers is disappearing. The tendency seems to be in the direction of consultation between the ofiicers and men on the subject of food, leave and disciplinary measures, and to obtain the concurrence of the rank and file in the orders issued by the officers.A degree signed by Ebert, Haase, Scheidemann, Ditmann, Landsberg and Barth lays down the following : The state of siege is abolished.The rights of reunion and association are granted to all without exception. This extends to employees and workmen working in state industries.The censorship is abolished; liberty of speech and correspondence.Freedom in the fulfilment of religious rites and abrogation of all constraint in this sphere.Complete amnesty for all political offences and cessation of all prosecutions for such offences.The law on compulsory work is revoked except in arbitration cases.The orders regulating the situation of persons in the services of others are alsorevoked.   The protection of the working classes, annulled at the beginning ofthe war, is re-established. Preparatory work for the introduction into the country of the eight-hour day to start on the 1st January, 1919. Measures to be taken to ensure work for the necessitous part of the population andfor the distribution of expenses between the Empire, the separate States andthe communes.Increase in the number of workmens insurances in case of illness; solution of thequestion of free lodgings. Energetic measures to be taken by the Government for the revictualling of thepopulation.The Government must protect trade, defend private property, the liberties and safety of the public.The greatest freedom must be granted for the elections to the Constituent Assembly; a special rule should be made to this effect.It is too early yet to form an opinion as to how far Bolshevism in Germany will go. It is said at present to be advancing, and the most will be made of this by the German representatives when it comes to a question of indemnity or compensation. Certain crude indications of this are to be found in the naive suggestion of financial houses in Bremen that the Allies must send a force to take charge of the city if they do not wish to see all the money available for indemnity dissipated by the mob. There is, however, evidence that the German banks are operating as smoothly as in pre-war times, which could not be the case if revolutionary disorder were rife.The repatriation trains are reported to be used for sending Bolshevik agents from Russia into Germany.
Switzerland.Since the collapse of the general strike on the 11th November (Armistice Day) the Swiss Government has taken some very decided steps against the Bolsheviks. On that day, after the railway station at Berne had tajen seized, a procession, headed by a red flag, began to march through the town. While it was passing a military hospital a sentry called to a man leading the procession to make less noise as there were sick people inside. The man replied, &quot; They are only soldiers, let them all die.&quot; Upon this the sentry felled him, and in the ensuing scuffle several persons lost their lives. The procession was dispersed, and with a vast majority of the people behind it, the Government began to take energetic measures. Motor lorries, two of them armed with machine guns, drew up outside the Bolshevik Legation. A civil official informed the Bolshevik Minister that the whole personnel were regarded as unwelcome guests, and that the arrangements for their journey out of the country had been confided to the military. An officer of the General Staff then entered and ordered them all into the lorries ; one man who attempted to address the crowd was roughly handled. Outside the town the procession halted, and they were all informed that if they attempted to leave the lorries they would be shot. The journey to the frontier occupied 16 hours, and at every halting place the hotel keepers refused, as soon as they knew who they were, to supply any food, and they had to be fed by the rations of the armed escort. The Government is now holding a stringent enquiry, and several other Bolsheviks (between 30 and 40 up to date) have been detained in fortresses because the Germans have refused entry into Germany.The Canton of Olten had declared for a form of Soviet Government, and though this came to nothing, the switzerland^s Communist Party has just issued a manefesto urging the establishment of Soviets for the whole country. They also proclaim a revolutionary general strike, and propaganda among the soldiers, farmers and factory hands. Their programme is : Socialisation of production, Confiscation of large estates, Abolition of mortgages, ,Socialisation of banks, Compulsory work, Repudiation of debts, Nationalisation of commerce.It is to be noted that the German Secret Agents are busy disseminating Bolshevik propaganda literature, and that the Bolsheviks have had very large sums transferred to Swiss banks for their own use ; that though the parties of law and order will give energetic support to the Government, the authorities are very uneasy about the future, and therefore the danger of fresh disturbances is not at an end.Early in January the Police discovered in a little village near Berne over a ton weight of Bolshevist pamphlets, printed in English, French and Italian. Thev urged the Allied troops to rise against their officers and declare themselves revolutionists. Apparently they had been written in the German Legation at Berne under the direction of Baron von Romberg and Major Count Bismarck, the Military Attache. The Federal Authorities now believe that another revolutionary movement is being organized and that the signal will be a general strike. There is a little doubt as to how the soldiers will respond.to another mobilization order, but a Civic Guard is being quietly organized.Scandinavia and Denmark.The revolutionary demonstrations in Copenhagen were easily put down, and the Danish Government is now preventing Russians from crossing the frontier. It is now collecting information on which action can be taken against Bolsheviks already in the country.Sweden.For many months past Bolshevism in Sweden has been allowed to grow, especially in the mining area, but at last the Swedish Government, apparently in consultation with Denmark and Norway, has begun to take decided action and only now has Vorovski been expelled, though permission was received from the Finnish Government for his passage through Finland some time ago. It is not yet clear whether anything has been done to restrain the bank that is financing Bolshevik propaganda from Stockholm.   The police force is believed by the authorities to be uncontaminated.
Norway.The position in Norway is much more favourable.   If the Spartacus element in Germany continues to grow, or if the Bolsheviks had some decisive military success in Russia, the Norwegian revolutionaries might take heart, but otherwise it is not likely h at they will make any headway.France.Bolshevik propaganda&apos; pamphlets have been circulated among the French troops returning from the front, but on the whole there is no sign as yet of any growth of Bolshevism in France. Jean Longuet and his party are having more success as preachers of better conditions for workmen than as propagandists of Bolshevism.On the other hand, unemployment, which is growing as demobilisation progresses, and the excessive cost of living, is bound before long to produce a dangerous state of unrest.Holland.The propaganda conducted both by Russian and German Bolshevik agents is probably stronger in the Netherlands than anywhere else. If it had not been for the ineptitude of Troelstra, who announced the revolution some days before, there might actually been a revolution, but as it is the counter-demonstration of the bourgeosie has retarded the movement. Nevertheless, the lack and the high price of provisions has created a very electric atmosphere among the lower classes and the position is certainly dangerous.   As in Switzerland a Civic Guard is being organized.Belgium.The great wave of enthusiasm over the re-entry of the King and Government into Brussels has entirely subsided, giving place to intense irritation against the Government. It is not only the question of provisions, which cost nearly twice as much as in France, but the feeling that the Government has wilfully ignored the strong public feeling against German sympathisers.    *A high Belgian official lately stated as his opinion that there must shortly be a general upheaval of the whole of the working classes. American reports are not quite so pessimistic, but it is very generally believed that unless prompt measures are taken to feed the people serious outbreaks must inevitably take place. 200,000 people are said to be unemployed, chiefly in the textile, metal and glass industries, owing to lack of machinery and raw material.Italy.The Italian Government also has taken serious alarm and there is a rapprochement between the Vatican and the Quirinal to resist the common enemy. The Government has now formed a Department for the Surety Publique, and has appointed Signor Vicenzo Quaranta to organize it. Unfortunately, Italian organization is usually very poor and the situation changes so much from day to day that no one can foretell what will happen in the near future. For the moment, revolution seems to be stayed, the Italians being full of their prowess and of their demands for the Adriatic Coast.Spain.The Government is dealing with the Bolshevik menace with what passes for energy in Spain. On the 17th January the suspension of tho Constitutional Guarantees i.e., a proclamation of Martial Law-was proclaimed in the province of Barcelona.Convinced that the German Secret Agents were fostering Bolshevism, they ordered a &quot; round-up &quot; of Russian Bolsheviks in Barcelona with a view to deporting them to Odessa as soon as a steamer was available, but as usually happens in Spain fully half of the number was found to have disappeared when the police came to execute the order; the other half is in detention.Revolution is very much mixed up with the Separatist Catalan movement, and it cannot be said that Bolshevism has attacked a very large section of the population. It is reported that many of the German agents are now taking refuge in the most. Catholic villages, and no doubt the great safeguard against anarchy in Spain is the priest. There is a constant succession of meaningless strikes in which the quiet men are driven like sheep before a handful of agitators.   A revolutionary leaflet, inciting the soldiers to
mutiny and to treat women and girls as common property, has been distributed by thousands among the Spanish troops. The authorities were able to confiscate some two thousand of thorn, which were already in the hands of the men. Some were surrendered voluutarily, others were only obtained by disciplinary action. This seems to show that propaganda has made some headway with the troops.A revolutionary movement is reported to be active in Andalusia.German-Austria.Bolshevism is extending rapidly in German-Austria and Bolshevists are to be found in the People&apos;s Army. This is causing the authorities great anxiety, for poverty and unemployment are increasing, and the people are showing more and more their dissatisfaction with the Government. Inflammatory articles in the Socialist Democratic Press against the middle classes are increasing the difficulties of the situation.The Czecho-Slovak Republic.The plundering of a few Bohemian and Moravian towns, and the chance remarks of many soldiers, seem to show that the Bolshevist ideas have iiad some success, and although it has not taken firm root in the Republic, there is a feeling of unrest among the unomployed that may easily turn to Bolshevism.Dr. Kramarz, when recently interviewed, said that the attempt on his life was inspired by Muna, who was sent to Bohemia by Lenin.roumania.Here Bolshevism is reported to be making headway.Bulgaria.It was lately reported that Bolshevist propaganda had failed amongst the Bulgarians, who were constitutionally opposed to it, but this does not appear to be supported by later information.England.All the revolutionary talk on platforms about the iniquity of the newspapers in reporting Bolshevik excesses, and the wickedness of the Government in intervening against the only Socialist State in Europe, seems to have fallen on deaf ears. It was admitted by leading extremists the other day that they could not hope to bring out the workmen on strike for the sake of Russia. We have in England a considerable body of revolutionary feeling, but it is home grown, and even men like George Lansbury, Editor of the Herald, are opposed to violent methods. On the whole, it seems likely that the revolution, if not a constitutional one, will come by the ballot box and not by violence, and that in any case it will not be accompanied by a terror of the Russian type. Though great harm is done by hysterical speakers like John McLean of Glasgow, and women like Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, on the whole it seems better to allow the whole subject of revoluion to be thoroughly ventilated than to attempt to suppress it. The pity is that so little is done to counteract their revolutionary propaganda, which is circulated with so much industry.The present strike in Glasgow is not an industrial. one. The strike was planned at a secret meeting, attended by well-known revolutionary agitators, which was held in London in the middle of January, when it was resolved to make Glasgow a test strike on the hours question, and if it was successful to call out the workers in South Wales and other places.Private information goes to show that the Belfast strike was engineered in Glasgow, and that the object of the promoters, who are purely revolutionaries, is to overthrow social order. For this reason it is very desirable that the Government should not intervene, except in so far as may be necessary to maintain public order, and there is evidence to show that the strike has become increasingly unpopular, especially among women.It is much to be regretted that it has been necessary to read the Riot Act and call out the military im support of the police at Glasgow, because it is sure to be turned to account hereafter by the rioters. If, however, the revolutionary agitators get themselves into public odium with the steadv-ffoins: working men a serious industrial upheaval may be averted.
On the 25th January the Bolshevik Government in Russia sent out a wireless, message proposing to invite all the extreme revolutionary movements in the different countries to a new &quot; Internationale,&quot; naming the various organizations, 39 in number. Among them the only British organizations invited are: &quot; The British Socialist Party,&quot; &quot;The Socialist Labour Party,&quot; &quot;The Movement represented by John McLean,&quot; &quot; The Industrial Workers of the World &quot; (England), &quot; The I.A.I.W. of Great Britain &quot; (whatever that may mean), &quot; The Revolutionary Element of Shop Stewards &quot; and &quot; The Irish Labour Organization.&quot;The United States.The United States Government is believed to have instructed its diplomatic agents abroad to pay particular attention to Bolshevism. It is reported that Russian agents have combined with the Industrial Workers of the World (who are said to have agencies in every considerable city, particularly in the Middle West), and it must be remembered that labour disturbances, which run a normal or more or less peaceful course in England and France, are accompanied in the United States by violence and sabotage. On the other hand, it is not at all likely that in a country where most working men have money invested in property, anything like a Bolshevik upheaval would have any chance of success. It is believed that the Government is considering the question of deporting Bolshevik agitators from the country.The United States appears to be very well informed of the progress of the move-ment in all countries, and the co-operation of the British and American Governments against this common enemy of civilisation is likely to be most valuable.Portugal.The authorities do not believe that Bolshevism is making any headway in Portugal, though at least two agents have been discovered and deported, and a sum of money has lately been transferred to the Bank Bauer in Madrid for propaganda in Portugal.B.
