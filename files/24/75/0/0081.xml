CA LIST OF COMMODITIES REQUIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT&apos;    Lgtt   W Q ARH S&amp;gfiBB QP BEING,MANUFACTURED. IN: W NATIONAL FACTORIES.0    Memorandum, from; the Minister of Munitions.In aooordanoe with the decision arrived at by the War Cabinet on January Oth (War Cabinet 514, Minute 5), I now circulate the attached Memorandum, prepared by officers of the Ministry of Munitions, dealing with tho manufacture in national faotories of commodities, other than munitions of war, required by the Government for its own use a list of those artioles ifaich are capable of being manufactured in national factories is attached tc the Memorandum (Schedule A,),   I would point out that hardly my of them can be so manufactured without offend-ing the general principle laid down by the Cabinet that the State will not compete with private enterprise in the manufacture of articles of general trade.  Even if the Government were the sole buyer of the entire output of a national factory, there would still be competition with private enterprise, seeing that the articles are articles of general trade, nftiioh have, in the past, been obtained for Government use by contracts with private firms already manufacturing for the trade.February 32nd 1919,
li      On January 8th, 1919, the   War Cabinet considered the question of the Disposal of National Factories and arrived at the following decisions :-(a) The Ministry of Munitions should be authorised to proceed subject to their discretion as to what Factories should be retained for Army Production, with the sale ,of the 85 Factories mentioned in Class B. of Sir Eric Gedtfes&apos; Memorandum (Paper G.T. 6601), giving preference, other things being equal, to Trade Unions, Co-operative Societies and Local Author!tos within the limits of legitimate local enterprise *In these transactions the Ministry of Munitions should consult the Minister of Reconstruction as hithertot(b) The State will not conpete with private enterprise in the manufacture of articles of general trade.(o)   Subject ft) (b) and with a view to decision as tothe possible utilisation for State purposes of some of. the Factories mentioned above, the Ministry of Munitions should at once prepare a report of artl-oles whioh they consider any specific National Fao-tory could make without the Sales Department being attached to it, and of which the Government will be the sole buyers.2. In accordance with the decision at (o) above, a listof articles is submitted (Schedule A attached), which are re-quired by various Government Departments and which are capable of being manufactured in National Factoriesc3.       It has not been possible to obtain from the chief Government Purchasing Departments any statement either of demands for the financial year 1919 - 1920 or of normal de-/sList of Commodities required by the Government whioh are capable of being manufactured in National Factories.
nands in the future, because the size of the permanent Wavy and Army have not yet been decided, nor is the position as regards Surplus Stocks carried over from, the enormous War Establishment yet known.     It has only been possible, therefore, in informal discussion with the Admiralty, the War Office and the lost Office to arrive at an approximate list of articles normally required.   No statistical informa-tion as to quantities is available and without this it must be frailly state! that anything like a concrete proposal for the utilisation of the Factories is impossible.   Under the conditions in which this Memorandum has been prepared, it is scarcely possible to do more than make a few general observat ions on the sub j e c t.4.        The list of articles (Schedule A) attached has been prepared by selecting from tho articles normally required by various Government Departments those which are capable of being manufactured in National Factories.   None of the Factories are suitable as they stand for the manufacture of any of these articles.   In all cases some of the machinery would be surplus and additional balancing plant would, in most cases, be required.   On the other hand, there is no article in the Schedule which would call for the entire evacuation of the plant from the Factory and the installation of new plant, as would be the case if the early stages of textile manufacture - spinning and weaving - were to be under-taken. -5.        The following remarks may be made with regard to thecapabilities of certain typical Factories;-national Ordnance Factory, Nottingham.This Factory is suitable for heavy engineering work.   It could undertake with the necessary modifications -co plant, such manufacture as marine engines, large turbines, heavy hydraulic machinery, locomotives and other work of this class.
National Projectile Factories, Qardonald &amp; Lancaster,The equipment in shops of this type is suitable for medium engineering work, as, for instanoe, high speed engines, refrigerating maohinery, small turbines and machinery of a similar type.National Machine Gun Factory. Burton-on-Trent.The equipment here is suitable for light and accurate engineering work, such as Cycles, Motor Cycles, Light Car Engines, Ship and telegraph instruments and small metal, fittings.national Small   Arms Cartridge Factory. Worcester.This factory could undertake small press work, such as electrical end other brass fittings, radiator tubes for aeroplanes, etc.National Rolling Hills, Southampton.&quot;The equipment here is suitable for brass and copper tubes, wire rod and sheet, and, with entirely new plant for the purpose, electrical cables.National. Box and Aeroplane, Factories.These factories could be utilised for making window frames, doors, furniture and wooden constructional work generally in connection with the Government Housing Soheme.8uoh factories as the Explosives, Filling, Anti-gas Factories, etc, may in general, be looked upon as suitable only for their original purpose.      They certainly do not appear to be capable of conversion to any manufacture, of:which the entire output could be taken and used by the Government.6. The, foregoing notes deal in general terms with the suitability of such national Factories for different kinds of industry.     The range of capacity practically covers thewhole field of engineering industry and at these Factoriese.ll the articles mentioned in the Schedule could be manii-factured.    Most of these articles are such as have beenobtained for Government use by contracts, with private, firmsalready manufacturing for the Trade, and only a few are includedin.the Schedule which might be manufactured by the Governmentfor general purposes, if such a policy were determined upon -e.g. locomotives and railway material ( in the event of the nationalisation of railways.) Marine engines, turbines and heavy hydraulic machinery, High speed engines, etc.   In the
majority of cases the -quantitiesrequired hy the various Departments are relatively small and would not-warrant the establishment of separate factories, but in some cases produotion might be on such a scale as to secure economio production at the expense, however, of private enterprise. As an instanoe, it may be pointed &quot;out that the Admiralty have almost invariably looked to private marine engineering firms for the construction of large marine engines for Y/ar Ships, which are of a design different from any commercial design, though capable of being made in the same shops., A Government Establishment would it is thought afford assist-ance in dealing with new designs and in the carrying out of repairs and replacements, v/hich are generally expensive at private firms.   , This question is, however one for the Admiralty to consider,In the case, also, of the Post Office, it might be   a question whether Telegraph and Telephone apparatus could oe manufactured economically, but it is understood that it has been the policy of that Department in the past to encourage manufacturers to lay down plant in this country, for the manufacture of such articles as tiephones, etc     In view of this past policy which has led among other things to the erection of:large telephone works by private firms, it would oe questionable whether the Government should now procoed to duplioate them.The following goneral observations may be made :-(a) Until private industry is fully employed any manu*-facturing capacity set up by the Government would simply transfer the work from one plant in one district to another plant in another district.     There would bo no addition&quot;to the amount of labour employed in the country, except that caused by the construction ofany additional plant that might be/required.(b) Even without taking into consideration the large stocks of materials which will presumably be left over after the war, it is doubtful whether,apart from those named above, there is any commodity required by the Government
in sufficient quantities to warrant the. setting up of a producing unit large enough to- secure economical production.(c)   It would therefore only he possible in these oases to keep factories at work on Government account by manufacturing a great variety of articles in the same &quot;factory,    Under svoh conditions the cost of production would be high as compared with the trade&apos;, though against that might be put the admini.Btrat.ive advantage of having data on which to judge 6t the tenders of privato firms.fd)   In the develosmont of the quality of the product and design a Government Factory would probably be handi-capped as compared with the trade.    large /Faotories turning out great quantities of a single commodity are in touch with a larger nuiber of users, and have a great inducement to Improve their quality and methods of production.(e) The possible field of manufacture might be enlarged were the. government to undertake the manufacture of commodities required by Municipalities and other Local Authorities.    But there would be no assurance that a satisfactory market could be found in oom-petition with ordinary trade.(f) Generally speaking it does not appear that there is any satisfactory  middle course between the taking over a whole industry in the country to be run as a Government monopoly and the present system of pur-chasing Government requirements from the trade.   Any intermediate oourse would miss the advantages both at. a monopoly, and of a minimum economic oost of production,8.    Tho general conclusion arrived at appears to be that for the present.at any,rate, there is -little to be aai&amp; in favour cf tho Government undertaking the manufacture of the majority of industrial products for its own use, while there are strong arguments ,against any such action being taken before private industry is ro-establishod.     It would no doubt, be possible to set up a few small National workshops for the manufacture of such things as Uniforms and Shirts, Boots, or Furniture, on a scale such that the-Government would be in a position to absorb the whole output.    But even in these oases the enter-prise would be at the expense of private industry.
