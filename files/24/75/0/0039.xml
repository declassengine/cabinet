PRIVATB AND confidential the WORK OFTHE DEPARTMENT OF PROPAGANDAENEMY COUNTRIESLONDON: ,Printed by, HIS MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICE.
FOREWORDThis is a record of one of the smaller activities of war, an activity, however, of which the importance was not to be judged from its size, Its effect upon enemy peoples and armies was, according to enemy testimony, out of all proportion to the small staff employed and the small amount of money expended. It came late into the field, but it opened fire at a moment when its operations were very much needed and when they had a good chance of success. Many think that, had they been begun at an earlier date, the war might have been sooner over. That cannot be more than a surmise, but it may be taken as common ground among all who studied enemy psychology that the British nation had too long neglected this activity. Those who were engaged in it during the earlier years of the war worked with tied hands and were hampered sorely by lack of funds.- It speaks well for their perseverance and enthusiasm that they were able to accomplish anything at all.When the business of Propaganda was taken in hand vigorously its influence was soon noticed.The policy of the Allied governments in relation to the subject races under the Austrian Crown was co-ordinated and strengthened, with the result of quickening up the disintegration of that Empire. No doubt can remain as to the very useful effect upon the Central Powers of the encouragement of nationalist and separatist aspirations among the Jugo-Slavs, Tchecho-Slovaks, Croats, and Rumanes, By this means, not only was the fighting will of the army weakened, but more important still, the energy of the centrifugal forces within the Austrian Empire was vastly increased and given more definite direction. The outcry against this new Allied weapon of offence sufficiently proved its sharpness. The Austrian leaders and newspapers showed by their angry and anxious phrases that we were striking at their weakest spot. The Germans also encouraged us to intensify our labours by letting us know that our arrows were hitting the mark. A very short time after the systematic daily distribution began over the German lines of news bulletins prepared with the same speed as a daily newspaper and dropped within forty-eight hours of their being written, Marshal Hindenburg issued his long and impassioned warning against belief in the statements they contained.This was a striking justification of the policy pursued by the Enemy Propaganda Committee. A point was made of telling the enemy only the truth. The truth was being concealed from them by their leaders. Nothing could be more effective in depressing their spirits and lowering their moral than a daily dose of unpleasant fact. They were told, therefore, of every reverse suffered by German, Austrian, Turkish and Bulgarian forces. They were given maps showing at a glance the extent of the territory on the Western Front which was being evacuated by the successive German retreats.  They were reminded of the sacrifices that had been made by theA(335) Wt.     P. &apos; 100. D.St.
German armies earlier in the year to win this territory ; and by every means possible, includinj the use of picturesque and forcible diagrams, the American menace was impressed upon thenj Reminders were issued of the false prophecies made by the German leaders as to the impossibility of America sending troops, as to the certainty of peace after the March offensive, as to thl inevitable exhaustion of Great Britain by U-boat warfare, and proof was given of the futilitj of the autocratic Central Powers continuing to bleed their peoples to death. At-the same time! the truth about the origin of the war was brought home to millions of minds hitherto delude! by the fiction that Germany had been attacked.If this task of enlightenment had not been entrusted to a department created for the specia purpose, it would have rightly formed part of the duties of the Ministry of Education. Ours was task of education, and its effect will endure far beyond the war. It was a systematic and carefull planned attack upon German moral. It was the first attempt at a day by day conversion of thf enemy, under the cumulative influence of information and argument, to the belief that the had been deceived and buoyed up by false hopes from the beginning, and that their only wis course was to cut their losses, drive out their criminally ambitious and lying rulers, and stan afresh.To how great an extent the work done upon these lines contributed to bring about thf successive revolutions in Bulgaria, Austria and Germany, which put an end to the war, will neve be exactly ascertained. There is no doubt, however, that it materially did so contribute. On: enemies, indeed, declared that their downfall was chiefly due to propaganda. Austrian authorities lamented the impetus given to nationalist tendencies as the push which finally upset the totterin; Hapsburg Empire.  The Germans asserted that the leaflets and pamphlets distributed daily i of enormous quantities were responsible both for panic in the Army, which caused the armistio I proposal, and the resentful impatience of the people, which impelled them to sweep away thei rulers and their antiquated system of government as obstacles to peace and to national develop jfpj ment upon healthy lines.   If what our enemies said was true, we may congratulate ourselve upon our share in bringing about the defeat of Prussianism ; and we can do so with all the mon I satisfaction for the reason that, as our engine of warfare, we relied solely upon the Truth.GjSt beIPiDind ffi( nd fOfliep nfcbus] eej n r o leisef
APPOINTMENT OF LORD NORTHCLIFFE.Til, l/^N February 13th Lord Nortlicliffe was invited to undertake the direction of Propaganda jly  in Enemy Countries, and the invitation was accepted by him, upon the understanding hl\^   that he should report directly to the Prime Minister, keeping, however, close touch with tJthe Ministry of Information.lel    At once Lord Northcliffe secured the assistance of the available men best qualified to assist lim, men versed in Continental politics, acquainted with the psychology of the enemy peoples,ed&quot; &quot;and accustomed to bringing influence upon the public opinion.The earliest enemy country to be taken in hand was Austria. The methods employed there, bid the success achieved, will be fully described later on.Here it need only be noted that immediately after his appointment Lord Northcliffe set about constituting a small Inter-Ally Committee on Enemy Propaganda. Three meetings were ldd at Crewe House with M. Franklin-Bouillon of Paris, and Signor Gallenga-Stuart of Rome, others present being:Viscount Northcliffe Mr. C. J. PhillipsLord Beaverbrook &apos; M. Henri MoyssetLieutenant-Colonel Sir Campbell Stuart lieutenant TonnelatMr. Wick-ham Steed M. ComertLieutenant-Colonel Granville Baker Mr. RickeyMr. Robert Donald Mr. RobinetteMr. Hudson (Secretary) Delegates to the proposed Inter-Ally Committee were nominated by the Governments of Jreat Britain and Italy.  The French nomination was made, but not confirmed. The United jjui States did not nominate anybody. Therefore, for the moment, the proposal fell through. As will )e related in the proper place, it was revived later and carried out with valuable results.While Austria was being taken in hand, Bulgaria was also studied, and a programme of ^Propaganda for use there drawn up. Turkey was, by request, left to a department of the Ministry iiff Information under Lord Beaverbrook.After these matters had been dealt with and work begun, Lord Northcliffe was attacked by i long and troublesome illness, which compelled him to spend some months out of London, hiring his absence he appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Campbell Stuart to act as Deputy Director of the Department. A Committee was also arranged for, numbering among its members : Colonel the Earl of Denbigh, C.V.O. Sir Charles Nicholson, Bart., M.P.Mr. Robert Donald Mr. James 0&apos;Grady, M.P.Sir Roderick Jones, K.B.E. Mr. H. Wickham SteedSir Sidney Low Mr. H. G. WellsMr. H. K. Hudson (Secretary) The Crewe House Committee met every fortnight, and heard reports upon the work which as being done. Mr. C. J. Phillips and Commander Standing, R.N.V.R., attended both these nd the daily meetings of the small executive Committee, having been appointed to act as liaison Dicers from the Foreign Office and the Admiralty. Their services were of the utmost value, nd the same may be said touching the work done later by Captain Chalmers Mitchell as War office liaison officer. Colonel the Earl of Onslow did excellent work as representative of the epartment in Paris. For a time Mr. S. A. Guest acted as a link between the Ministry of lformation and Crewe House. Later he became a valued member of the staff of the latter.The daily committee meetings proved an excellent means of disposing instantly of all usiness; of dealing with suggestions (which, it is needless to say, were legion in number) ; of eeping up close co-operation between all departments ; and of striking out ideas by the friction minds one against the other. Often the Committee would invite to their meetings diplomatists r others whose information or advice was likely to be of value. Up to the end of their labours, ie Crewe House heads of departments continued these daily conferences, and found them most seful.(335) A 2ml saw:he ley isc arttheveitiesact leii ppves tore
AUSTRIA-HUNGARY,Lord NorthcliftVs direction of Propaganda in Enemy Countries was inspired by two mai considerations: (a) The necessity of telling enemy peoples and governments the truth in regard to tl intentions and position of the Allies, and(b) The essential connection between truthful propaganda of this kind and the ultima! terms of peace.The position at the beginning of March, 1918, was that the German Government and peop were so elated by the collapse of Russia and by the belief in their power to gain a decisive victo on the Western front, that direct Propaganda in or against Germany offered few prospects success. In Bulgaria conditions were similar, inasmuch as the accessibility of Bulgaria Allied Propaganda necessarily depended upon the Bulgarian estimate of the possibility of German victory. Austria-Hungary appeared, therefore, the only enemy country assigned Lord Northcliffe&apos;s department in which adequate Propaganda offered some chance of success Efforts were therefore concentrated at the outset against Austria-Hungary.The Allied Governments had always neglected the fundamental consideration that som three-fifths of the Hapsburg peoples were actually or potentially the friends of the Allies, while only two-fifths the Germans of Austria, and the Magyars of Hungary were definitely hostile The further consideration that it was upon the Germans of Austria and the Magyars that German relied for keeping her grip upon Austria-Hungary, had also been neglected in practice, howevs much it may, have been recognised in theory. It seemed, therefore, necessary so to direr Propaganda that the non-German and non-Austrian peoples of Austria-Hungary should encouraged to believe in the friendship of the Allies for them and in the certainty of Allied victor In this way it seemed possible to neutralise the influence of the Austrian Germans and Magyars and thus gradually-to paralyse the striking power of the Austro-Hungarian arp which was then preparing the decisive offensive against Italy.The greatest difficulty in the way of linking-up the pro-Ally Hapsburg peoples with eac other and of mobilising their influence on the side of the Allies, lay in the existence of the Londo Treaty of April, 1915, by which Russia, Great Britain, and France had promised to Italy certai territories inhabited by the Southern Slavs. As long as Allied policy was represented onli by this Treaty, it appeared impossible to convince the Southern Slavs that the Allies real wished them well. Under the influence of the Southern Slav Unitary Declaration, conclude at Corfu on June 20th, 1917, by the President of the Southern Slav Committee, Dr. Trumbitcli and Mr. Pashitch, on behalf and with the assent of the Government of Serbia and the leadin Serbian public men, the movement for union with Serbia which had long existed among Serbs, Croats and Slovenes of Austria-Hungary, took definite shape and affected the Souther Slav regiments of the Austro-Hungarian army. This development of the movement disquiete the German military authorities and hastened their decision to take direct control of the Hapsbur forces. This they did in October, 1917, and organised the offensive which broke the Italian lir at Caporetto.As soon as the Italian line had been established on the Piave, an attempt was made in Londc by Mr. Wickham Steed, Dr. Seton-Watson, and other members of the Serbian Society of Grea Britain, to promote conferences between leading Italians and members of the Southern island Committee with a view to establishing a general agreement that might serve as a basis for solution of the Italo-Southern Slav question.With great courage and patriotic insight, General Mola, the Italian Military Attache London, attended those conferences and contributed greatly to their success. A memoranda containing roughly the general points under discussion was communicated to the Italian Prim
143unSheLtePjr\oU(I j tess;Minister, Signor Orlando, in London, in January, 1918. At the suggestion of Mr. Steed, Signor Orlando thereupon received Dr. Trumbitch and after considerable discussion with him, invited lim to Rome. In the meantime an influential Italian parliamentary committee, representing both Houses of Parliament, sent one of its members, Dr. Torre, to London with the object of stablishing, if possible, a definite basis of agreement. After much negotiation in which Mr. teed, Dr. Seton-Watson, and Sir Arthur Evans took part, the agreement was concluded which vas subsequently ratified by the Congress of the Hapsburg Subject Races held at Rome, with :ie assent of the Italian Government, on April 8th, 9th and 10th. For the sake of convenience, le terms of this agreement, together with the general resolutions of the Congress, in which it as embodied, may be given here. The resolutions received the public adhesion of several italian ministers, including the Prime Minister and Signor Bissolati:&quot;The representatives of the nationalities subjected in whole or in part to the rule of Austria-Hungary the Italians, Poles, Rumanes, Czechs, and Southern Slavs. join in afforming their principles of common action as follows :&quot; (1) Each of these peoples proclaims its right to constitute its own nationality and State unity, or to complete it, and to attain full political and economic independence.&quot; (2) Each of these peoples recognises in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy the instrument of German domination and the fundamental obstacle to the realisation of itsnreal;; b! oranhill aspirations and rights.tilei &quot; The assembly recognises the necessity of a common struggle against the common .anl oppressors, in order that each people may attain complete liberation and national unity within a free State unit,&quot; The representatives of the Italian people and of the Jugo-Slav people in particular, agree as follows : &quot; (1) In the relation of the Italian nation and the nation of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes  known also under the name of the Jugo-Slav nation the representatives of the two peoples recognise that the unity and independence of the Jugo-Slav nation is a vital interest of Italy, just as the completion of Italian national unity is a vital interest of the Jugo-Slav nation&apos;. And therefore the representatives of the two peoples pledge themselves to employ every effort in order that during the war and at the moment of peace, these ends of the two nations may be completely attained.&quot; (2) They declare that the liberation of the Adriatic Sea and its defence against every present and future enemy is a vital interest of the two peoples.&quot; (3) They pledge themselves also, in the interest of good and sincere relations between the two peoples in the future to solve amicably the various territorial controversies on the basis of the principles of nationality and of the right of peoples to decide their own fate, and in such a way as not to injure the vital interests of the two nations, as they shall be defined at the moment of peace.&quot; (4) To such racial groups (nuclei) of one people as it may be found necessary to include within the frontiers of the other, there shall be recognised and guaranteed the right of their language, culture, and moral and economic interests.&quot;^Sli ^ne conchision of the Italo-Jugo-Slav agreement in London had made it possible to begin ])paganda against Austria-Hungary on the lines conceived by Lord Northcliffe. Following conviction that effective Propaganda presupposes a clear policy and that an essential element uch a policy must be an attempt to being home to enemy peoples a sense of the significance the American war effort in support of the principles conceived by the President of the United tes, he laid before the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Balfour, a draft policy of Propaganda, and rjj eived official assent to it.foihe Jidn
The letters exchanged were these :&quot; February 24///, 1918.1&quot; My dear Mr. Balfour,&quot; I have long been of opinion that it would be well to concentrate on Propaganlj in Austria.&quot; I have made a point of seeing every available person who has come out of Austria including many Americans who returned to the United States when I was there. Aj shared the same view that the Dual Monarchy entered the greater war in a hal hearted spirit; is weary of the war ; has endured hardships approaching starvation! and realises that there is no benefit foe Austria arising out of the war.&quot; The control of the Presses of the various nationalities composing the Uul Monarchy is so absolute that the real facts of the war are unknown to the multitudl Germany is not idle in Austria or elsewhere.&quot; For example, the entrance of the United States into the war has been belittle! and described as mere American &apos; bluff.&apos;   Many subjects of Austrian nationalities hai before the war, considerable knowledge of the United States, owing to the gre emigration to that country.- They would realise the power of the United States explained to them.&quot; It is submitted with respect, therefore, that one of the first steps to be take is to spread, through all available channels, accurate facts about the America preparations.&quot; But, before making any beginning in that direction, or any others, I feel that must be placed in possession of knowledge of the policy of the Allies as to the Dili Monarchy.&apos;-&apos; I should be greatly obliged if you would give me your opinion on the followi suggestions, which are made after consultation with those well acquainted with Austri If they merit your approval, it is suggested that they be submitted to the United State France and Italy. As for the United States, I would personally ask Colonel House! expedite their consideration.   Time is essential.&quot; It is reported that this week Krupp&apos;s have purchased no less a journal than tt &apos; Fremdenblalt,&apos; despite the fact that the policy of Vienna newspapers is controlled I telephone from Berlin.&quot;It is suggested that there are two policies for the Department of Propagam in Enemy Countries. In order that there may be no misunderstanding in the Unite States, I have recapitulated elementary facts generally known.&quot; These two policies are as follows :&quot; (a) To work for a separate peace with the Emperor, the Court, and the aristocraq on the principle of not interfering with the domestic affairs of the Hapsbm Monarchy, and of leaving its territory almost or quite intact; or fr&quot; (b) To try to break the power of Austria-Hungary, as the weakest link in the chai of enemy States, by supporting and encouraging all anti-German and pro-Ali peoples and tendencies.&quot; The (a) policy has been tried without success. The Hapsburgs are not fn agents. They have not the power, even though they may wish, to break away froi Germany, because &quot; (1) They are controlled by the internal structure of their dominions (the Du System), which gives Germany decisive leverage over them through tl Germans of Austria and the Magyars of Hungary ; and&quot; (2) Because the Allies cannot offer them acceptable terms without breaking wit Italy.
&quot; It remains to try the (b) policy.&quot; This policy is not primarily, or even, in the last resort, necessarily anti-Hapsburgian ; it is not opposed to the interests of the Roman Catholic religion ; and it is in harmony with the declared aims of the Allies.&quot; The Empire of Austria contains some 31,000,000 inhabitants. Of these less than one-third, i.e., the 9,000,000 or 10,000,000 Germans of Austria, are pro-German. The other two-thirds (including the Poles, Czecho-Slovaks, Rumanes, Italians, and Southern Slavs) are actively or passively anti-German.&quot; The Kingdom of Hungary, including the &apos; autonomous &apos; kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, has a population of approximately 21,000,000, of which one-half (Magyars, Jews, Saxons and Swabians) may be considered pro-German, and the rest (Slovaks, Rumanes, and Southern Slavs) actively or passively anti-German.&quot; There are thus in Austria-Hungary as a whole, some 31,000,000 anti-Germans, and some 21,000,000 pro-Germans. The pro-German minority rules the anti-German majority. Apart from questions of democratic principle, the policy of the Allies should evidently be to help and encourage the anti-Germans.&quot; The chief means of helping them may be specified thus :&quot; (1) The Allied Governments and the President of the United States should insist upon their determination to secure democratic freedom for the races of Austria-Hungary on the principle of&apos; government by consent of the governed.&apos; Expressions such as &apos; self-government&apos; or &apos; autonomous development,&apos; should be avoided, because they have a sinister meaning in Austria-Hungary and tend to discourage the friends of the Allies.&quot; 2. For the same reason, statements that the Allies do not wish to &apos; dismember Austria &apos; should be avoided. The war cannot be won without so radical a transformation of Austria-Hungary as to remove its peoples from German control. The Hapsburgs may be driven to help in this transformation if Allied encouragement of the anti-German Hapsburg peoples is effective. By themselves the Hapsburgs cannot effect a transformation except in an an increasingly pro-German sense.&quot; 3. For propaganda among the anti-German peoples the agencies already existing should be utilised. These agencies are chiefly the Bohemian (Czecho-Slovak) National Alliance, the Southern Slav Committee, and various Polish organisa-tions.&quot; 4. The present tendency of the Italian Government to shelve the policy embodied in the London Convention of April 26th, 1915, and to adopt a policy of agreement with the anti-German races of Austria-Hungary should be encouraged and stimulated.&quot; 5. The ultimate aim of Allied policy should be, not to form a number of small, disjointed States, but to create a non-German Confederation of Central European and Danubian States.&quot; 6. The Germans of Austria should be free to join the Confederated States of Germany. They would, in any case, tend to secede from a transformed Austria, in which they would no longer be able to rule over. non-German peoples.&quot; In view of the great amount of cabling that will be necessary to achieve unity, may I ask you to let me have either your own suggestions, or your approval of those above mentioned, as speedily as possible.&quot; I ani, my dear Mr. Balfour,-&apos; Yours sincerely,&quot; NORTHCLIFFE.&quot;
In reply, Mr. Balfour wrote :&quot; February 26th, 1918.&quot; My dear Lord Northcliffe,&quot; Your very lucid memorandum raises in one shape or another the fundamental problem of the Hapsburg Empire. A final and authoritative answer to the question you put to me can only be given (if given at all) by the Cabinet, speaking in the name of the Government. But I offer the following observations on the subject, in the hope that they may help you in the immediate task for which you have been made responsible.&quot; If the two alternative policies of dealing with the Dual Monarchy set forth in your paper were mutually exclusive, and if they involved distinct and even opposite methods of propaganda, our position would be even more difficult than it is. For what we can do with the Austrian Empire does not wholly depend upon our wishes, but upon the success of our arms and the views of our Allies ; and, as these elements in our calculations cannot be estimated with certainty, we should inevitably remain in doubt as to which of the two mutually exclusive methods of propaganda it would be judicious to adopt.&quot; Fortunately, however, our position is not quite so embarrassing. As you point out with unanswerable force, everything which encourages the anti-German elements in the Hapsburg dominions really helps to compel the Emperor and the Court to a separate peace, and also diminishes the efficiency of Austria-Hungary as a member of the Middle-Europe combination. The Emperor, by these means, might be induced, or compelled, fundamentally to modify the constitution of his own State. If he refused &apos;to lend himself to such a policy, the strengthening of the non-German elements might bring about the same end even more effectually than if he lent his assistance to the process. But in either case, the earlier stages of that process are the same, and a propaganda which aids the struggle of the nationalities now subject either to Austrian Germans or to Magyar Hungarians towards freedom,and self-determination, must be right, whether the complete break-up of the Austrian Empire or its de-Germanisation under Hapsburg rule be the final goal of our efforts.&quot; Yours sincerely,&quot; ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR.&quot;To which Lord Northcliffe sent the following answer : &quot; February 27th, 1918.&quot; My dear Mr. Balfour,&quot; Many thanks for your prompt reply to my letter.&quot; Why I am anxious that we should move as rapidly as possible is that the Italian believe that a strong Austrian or Austro-German offensive against Italy will be launched within the next two months. If our propaganda in Austria is to help to weaken this offensive, or to turn it into a defeat, it ought, in my judgment, to begin at once, and all the agencies we can command ought to be hard at work within a fortnight.&quot; The representative of the American Propaganda Department is in London. The Italian will be here next week, and we could no doubt have a French representative at the same time.&quot; As to the memorandum, I am very pleased that you are in substantial agreement with the policy outlined. The two policies may not be mutually exclusive in the last resort, but it is very important that one or the. other of them should be given absolute precedence. It would place me in an awkward predicament if, after basing vigorous propaganda on the (b) policy, I were confronted with some manifestation of the (fl) policy on the part of the British or other Allied Government.   For this reason I hope
145that the War Cabinet will not delay its own decision, and that it will try to get a decision from France, Italy, and the United States as quickly as possible.&quot; It goes without saying that public declarations on behalf of the British, French and Allied Governments, and, if possible, on the part of President Wilson, in the sense of the (b) policy would, if promptly made, greatly facilitate my efforts.&quot; Yours sincerely,&quot; NORTHCLIFFE.&quot;This policy thus outlined definitely gave precedence to the liberation of the Subject Races of Austria over any attempt to conclude a separate arrangement with the Hapsburgs. It aimed not so much at the dismemberment of Austria, as at the constructive liberation of the peoples, whom the Hapsburgs had held in subjection. Whereas a mere policy of negative dismemberment might have been open to objection, on the score that its success would merely break up an old-established policy without substituting for it anything save a disjointed series of small, rival States, the policy conceived by British Propaganda was one of forming a basis for a future confederation or alliance of free non-German peoples in Central Europe, by promoting preliminary agreement among their representatives. The Congress of Rome thus became an act of constructive inter-Allied Propaganda. As regards the Italo-Jugo-Slav dispute, the aim of the promoters of the Congress was, in particular, to offer to the Italian people and the Italian Government not less than to the French and British Governments, a way of escape from the alternatives with which the Treaty of London of April, 1915, confronted them.   Those alternatives were :1. The executicfti of the Treaty by the assignment to Italy of large Southern Slav districts against the will of their inhabitants, with the inevitable consequence of a future war between Italy and the Southern Slavs ; or . The abrogation of the Treaty in obedience to the general principles of the Allies and the consequent risk of occasioning in Italy a sense of national humiliation and loss.The policy adopted by the Rome Congress, and accepted by the Italian Prime Minister, offered on the other hand to Italy the leadership of the whole process of liberating the subject Hapsburg peoples and thus assigned to her a role in accordance with her best traditions, and of a nature to satisfy her liberal aspirations while securing for her a large field of moral and economic expansion.During the interval between the conclusion of the Italo-Jugo-Slav Agreement and the meeting of the Rome Congress, Lord Northcliffe sent Mr. Wickham Steed to Italy at the head of a special mission which, with the support of the Italian Prime Minister, and the Italian Commander-in-Chief, and of the British and French Commanders, organised at Italian Headquarters a permanent Inter-Allied Propaganda Commission that arranged for the distri-bution of Porpaganda literature, in the chief Austro-Hungarian languages, among the Austro-Hungarian troops at the front. Representatives of each of the principal subject races were attached to the commission to supervise the drafting and printing of the literature. Lieut.-Colonel Granville Baker remained permanently at Italian Headquarters as representative of Lord Northcliffe&apos;s department. He received every assistance and encouragement from General Delme Radcliffe, head of the British Military Mission. The actual work of Propaganda was naturally directed by representatives of the Italian Military authorities, and in particular by Colonel Siciliani and Captain Ugo Ojetti with the help of the chief Italian Intelligence officers. After the Rome Congress, this organisation distributed by aeroplanes, contact patrols, balloons and rockets, many million leaflets based upon the resolutions of the Rome Congress. Gramophone records of Czech-Slovak and Southern Slav songs were also secured by the British Commissioner and used in the front line trenches. The Commission also published a newspaper in the 1 Czecho-Slovak, Southern Slav, Roumanian and Polish languages, containing news collected I mainly from the Austro-Hungarian press, by a special Italian office which Professor Borgese had I set up at Berne.   Professor Borgese&apos;s efforts in this respect deserve the highest praise.I    (335) B
The Propaganda work of the Austrian section of the Department, conducted activclj throughout the summer, fell mainly under four heads :(1) The work of the Central Inter-Allied Commission at Padua, directed by representatives of the Italian Headquarters Staff, with the constant co-operation of Lieut.-Colonel Granville Baker, the British member of the Commission.(2) The maintenance of contact with this Commission of the Austro-Hungarian section of the Crewe House organisation in London, and simultaneously of close contact with the leaders of the Czecho-Slovak, Jugo-Slav, Rumanian and other organisations in Entente and neutral countries.(3) The establishment of regular relations between the British Government and the Czecho-Slovak National Council, as the recognised head of the Czecho-Slovak Army; and(4) The inspection and co-ordination of anti-Austrian organisations in Switzerland, This was undertaken partly by correspondence between Mr. Guest and his agents in Switzerland, and partly by a special mission of Dr. Seton-Watson in May and June to Geneva, Berne and Zurich. In this way closer contact was established between the British organisation and various Slav organisations whose main work was directed against Austria-Hungary.With regard to the first of these activities the &quot; commissioner Centrale Interalleata di Propaganda &quot; in Italy, Colonel Granville Baker made the following report .&quot; This Commission was the outcome of several meetings held during March, under Lord Northcliffe&apos;s presidency, at Crewe House. At these rrffietings it was decided to organise a Committee which should arrange with France and Italy for joint action against the Austro-Hungarian Army. The policy decided on was meant to disintegrate the army of the Dual Monarchy by appealing to the national sentiment of the men belonging to the various races under the Hapsburgs&apos; oppressive domination.&quot; To ensure co-operation among the Allies, several questions concerning the relations between Italy and the Southern Slavs had to be settled and this was effected so satisfactorily as to make possible a great congress of representatives of all the Allies and of the oppressed races. This congress was held at the Capitol in Rome on 10th April 1918. Rome was chosen for this historic event in order to emphasize the fact that Italy, as near neighbour of the Southern Slavs (one of the races suffering under Teuton-Magyar tyranny), was obviously called upon to lead the great and generous movement.&quot; The congress proved a great success, and it seemed as if the enthusiasm aroused by its proceedings would result in unremitting generous effort towards freeing the subject races who, on their side, were burning to assist in the task of overthrowing the Hapsburg monarchy and restoring peace. Italy was still smarting under the influence of the Caporetto disaster. The purely military work of the enterprise was to be effected by means of direct Propaganda among officers and men of the oppressed races, serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army. To carry out this work a Commission was set up and called the &quot; commissioner Centrale Interalleata di Propaganda.&quot; The title, composition and functions of this Commission were discussed and decided upon at a meeting held under General BadoglkVs presidency at the Italian Comando Supremo several days before, the Rome Congress. The Intelligence Officers of the Italian Armies were present as were also Brig.-General Delme Radcliffe (Chief of the British Military Mission to Italy), and Mr. Wickham Steed, as Lord Northcliffe&apos;s representative. To Mr. Stced&apos;s eloquence and grasp of the subject under discussion was due the enthusiastic reception of the suggestion of a Commission. General Badoglio decided on the title of the Commis-sion, and also that it should have its seat at Padua within easy reach of the Italian Comando Supremo. Mr. Wickham Steed, speaking for Lord Northcliffe, insisted on the preponderance of Italian representation on the Commission, as its efforts would be
directed from the Italian front against Italy&apos;s immediate enemies. Thus Italy found a president and one commissioner and all the clerical staff, whereas Great Britian and France were represented by one commissioner each. The subject races of Austria-Hungary were also represented by members ao the respective National Committees. The functions of these gentlemen were already defined by Mr. Wickham Steed at. the Comando Supremo meeting on the principle that only representatives of the oppressed races were fully qualified to speak to their co-nationals on the burning subjects of the time, and with voice and phrase that would appeal to them in a manner that no one outside those nationalities could hope to equal in effect. In this Lord Northcliffe and his representative took a high view of Italian capacity for generosity, which was, unhappily, not justified by subsequent events.&quot; The Commission took offices at 1, Corso del Popolo, Padua, and began to work on April 18th ; the inauguration meeting was presided over by Colonel Siciliani, and attended by Lieutenant-Colonel B. G. Baker, Commissioner for Great Britain ; Major Grass, Commissioner for France; Captain Ojetti, Commissioner for Italy; Dr. Trumbitch, President, and M. Trinastitch, member of the Jugo-Slav National Committee, happened to be in Padua at the time, and were invited, together with Major Christitch, Serbian Military attache to Italian Comando Supremo, to attend the meeting by the British Commissioner. This was resented by the President and Italian Commissioner, who thus gave the first indication of the conduct they intended to adopt towards the representatives of the oppressed races for whose liberation such perfervid perorations had resounded from the Roman Capitol.&quot; The legitimate work of the Commission, that of compiling literature, printing and distributing it to the Italian armies, was delayed by various circumstances. The actual President of the Commission turned out to be a Colonel Grossi a benevolent gentleman of no fixed purpose and no recognisable ability. Colonel Grossi handed over his responsibility to Colonel Siciliani, who, as Chief of the Intelligence Section at Comando Supremo, was fully occupied, and was inclined to treat the Commission a amiable vagary of an English politician of good intent, and not as a vital factor towards victory. So Colonel Siciliani allowed his duties as President to devolve more and more on Captain Omjetti. This officer, a man of energy and undoubted capacity, would have proved an excellent executive member of the Commission had he not been influenced too strongly by a personal ambition in no way connected with the hope of victory in the war.&quot; So, from the start, the Italian section of the Commission was influenced by political and personal considerations which had nothing to do with its object. In the meantime, the Commission began to work automatically. We acquired the use of a polyglot printing press at Reggio, Emilia. A weekly journal was published in Czech, Polish, Serb and Rumanian ; leaflets in those languages were composed by the National Representatives; and colour reproductions of a patriotic or religious nature, to appeal to the Nationalist Czech or Croat, or the pious Pole, added variety to our assorted Propaganda literature.&quot;All this literary matter was dispatched straight to the front-line armies from the printing press, and distributed by them. The means of distribution were by aeroplane (one per army being detailed for this purpose), by rockets, which were constructed to hold about 30 pamphlets, by hand grenades, and by contact patrols. These patrols were originally formed by bodies of troops raised on the responsibility of the various Italian Armies. They were composed of deserters of Czecho-Slovak, Jugo-Slav, Polish or Rumanian Nationalities who had volunteered for this service against their hereditary enemy, and they did uncommonly good work.&quot;-There was yet another method of distribution which was largely used on the Western Front, and introduced on the Italian Front. This was the &quot;Naud&quot; grenade, an excellent engine, fired like a rifle grenade and capable of dispersing leaflets at a distance of 250 to 1000 yards, and covering about 200 square yards, according to the direction and strength of the wind. This method was invented by Captain Naud of theB2
2nd bureau of the French Army. Lord Northcliffe had obtained sanction from the French War Office for Captain Naud and his assistant, Lieut. Moreau, to accompany his Mission to Italy where the working of the engine was exhibited to the Italian Army, authorities. As these latter expressed high appreciation of the engine at first sight, Lord Northcliffe ordered a large consignment of Naud grenades to be sent to Padua, where tliey were to be charged with leaflets ready for distribution. The arrival of this consignment was reported to Comando Supremo on 27th April, and on the same date Colonel Siciliani wrote refusing to accept it, alleging that the grenades were found by experiment to be unsuited to the Italian front. The experiment, however, had not been attempted. This proceeding caused the French Military authorities considerable annoyance, and led the French Commissioner to show less interest in the proceedings of the Commission. His tendency-was noticed by the Italian Commissioner, who thought fit to make the position of his colleagues impossible. Thus the French Commissioner was dispossessed of his office. A similar attempt, in a roundabout way, was made on Colonel Baker, without success.&quot; The reasons for the Italian Commissioners action appeared to be the following: that his schemes for furthering his own political advancement led him to interfere with the work of the Jugo-Slav representatives. This was done by censoring their writings whenever they touched upon the question of a future independent Jugo-Slav State which might conflict with the conception of Italy&apos;s Imperial destiny in south-east Europe, the dream of a certain school of Italian politicians.&quot;As the French Commissioner took no further interest in the work of the Cora-mission, Colonel Baker felt it his duty to support the National Representatives. Their status and that of their National Committees was not satisfactory; they Were made to feel like poor relations left standing on the door mat. The first step was evidently to find out whether the -National Committees could, in time, become recognised as provisional Governments which could treat with the Allied Powers on an equal footing, a simple matter of justice considering the sufferings and the just aspirations of the races concerned.&quot; The Czecho-Slovaks were the easiest to deal with in this respect. They had already formed the framework of their State, and a convention had been signed between Signor Orlando and Lieut.-Colonel Stefanitch, recognising a newly-raised division composed of Czecho-Slovaks formerly under the Austrian colours, as part of the Czecho-Slovak National Army. There were several obvious difficulties in the case of Jugo-Slavs, Poles and Roumanians. I was, however, able to draw up a memorandum suggesting how an improvement could be brought about. This memorandum reached the Prime Minister just before his departure for France, where, in the first days of June, at a conference at Versailles, Baron Sonnino threw away the chance of performing an action generous and just. This action of Baron Sonnino re-acted immediately on the Italian Front, and was noticed especially during the Austro-Hungarian offensive in the middle of June. There had been a considerable amount of desertion from the Austro-Hungarian Army. Among the deserters were a&apos; considerable number of junior officers, not professional soldiers, but men who in private life were lawyers, merchants, etc. These men were all induced to come over by the prospect of liberation which our propaganda held out to them. Men of other ranks were induced to desert, either to join relations among their co-nationals fighting in the Italian Army, of whom news had reached them through our agency, or else by the more elementary considerations of food, comfort and safety. It was noticeable that nearly all the deserters brought with them copies of the leaflets distributed by us.&quot; That our propaganda had seriously alarmed the Austro-Hungarkn authorities was made evident by reference to it in Army Orders and the Austrian and German Press, which even reproduced some of our literary efforts, and vilified Lord Northcliffe in their most fervent manner. Our propaganda even affected the minor tactics of the Austro-Hungarian Army, for it necessitated the detachment of machine gun sections
to deal with attempts at desertion en masse during the offensive, and there is at least one authenticated account of a mutiny among Czech troops being suppressed by Germans and Magyars during the Piave offensive. Desertions of single men or small parties were frequent before and during the action, and one case is known in which a whole unit came over. This was a company composed entirely of Jugo-Slavs. The Company Commander (Jugo-Slav and strongly nationalist), on going his rounds a couple of hours before the attack was launched, gathered from his men&apos;s conversation that they had no intention of fighting. He was able to bring his whole company over. But, on the whole, the Austro-Hungarian troops of all nationalities, especially Croats and Bosniaks, fought very stoutly in the Piave offensive. This I consider due to more than one cause. The first, and I fear the strongest motive, was that the Croats and Bosniaks refused to surrender to Italians whom they considered their inferiors as fighting men ; secondly, news of Baron Sonnino&apos;s performance at Versailles had reached the men of those nationalities, had increased their innate distrust of the Italians, and had somewhat shaken their faith in the good will towards them of the other Allies.&quot; The eventual success of Italian arms in resisting the Austro-Hungarian offensive and in regaining lost ground, treated as a glorious victory in Italy, proved somewhat injurious to the interests of the oppressed races and to propaganda operations. The position of the National Representatives, especially the Jugo-Slavs, was made more difficult by the tone of the Italians, who wanted to insist on distributing over the Austrian Army songs of exultation over Italy&apos;s great victory. The treatment of prisoners of war of the various nationalities was another cause of annoyance to the National Committees, to whom it seemed that any Italian success meant a dimming of their hopes and aspirations.&quot; In spite of this handicap, propaganda made progress even among the Magyars who had fought with particular ferocity on the Montello. The agrarian question that has troubled Hungary for some time was used for propaganda purposes, and soon desertions among the lower-class Magyars became a common occurrence. During this period of the Italian campaign gramophones were used for propaganda work. They gave renderings of Czecho-Slovak and Jugo-Slav songs in the front line trenches. I have not been able to compile statistics on the numbers who were drawn by these mechanical sirens.&quot; Propaganda by these various methods continued to exert an ever-increasing influence on the Austro-Hungarian Army. News of the victorious progress of the Allied armies on the Western front was sent over the lines continually and kept well up-to-date. Desertions and disorder increased among the ranks of the cncmy&apos;s army to such an extent that, finally, in the last days of October, one vigorous blow by British Divisions brought down in a crumbling mass an army which had for centuries shown a surprising capacity for recovering from defeat.&quot; In conclusion&apos; I wish to state my opinion that the propaganda effort on the Italian front was, on the whole, successful in that it contributed largely to the dis-integration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by consolidating the interests of the races subject to the Hapsburgs by bringing these interests to the notice of the Allied Governments, and by using the forces thus created to break up the army of the Dual Monarchy. Speaking as British member of the Commission, I further state that the work of the Propaganda Commission, though hindered by the attitude of Italian politicians and the hesitancy of statesmen of other Allied countries, was helped by the honest and capable co-operation of the National Committees and their representatives, and by the efforts of the Intelligence Officers of the Italian Armies ; and I should like to take this opportunity of stating that the British Military Mission, under General Delme Radcliffe, assisted me in every way.&quot; B. GRANVILLE BAKER,&quot; Lieut.-Colonel.&quot;
The Propaganda thus initiated had the effect of deranging the Austrian military plans fa j a limited offensive towards the middle of April ; and, during May and June, it induced so mam I Austrian soldiers, belonging to the subject races, to come over to the Allied lines, that befort the big Austrian offensive was launched at the end of June, the Italian and Allied commander; were completely informed of the enemy plans and of the positions of his artillery and ammunition I dumps. After the Piave victory, the Italian Commander-in-Chief expressly recognised tht I great value of the Propaganda in helping to prepare it. It is possible that, had the officia&apos; 1 policy of the Italian Government during May and June been less reticent in regard to the Czecho I Slovaks and the Jugo-Slavs, the victory on the Piave might have been decisive.The reticence of Italian policy proved, indeed, so severe a handicap upon the work oi Propaganda, that at the Inter-Allied Enemy Propaganda Conference, convened by Lord Northcliffe in London on August 14th, a resolution was passed, with the assent of the British French, American and Italian delegates, inviting the Italian Government to take the initiativi in making a public declaration in favour of the creation of a united and independent Southern Slav State. Some weeks later, the Italian Cabinet, after much discussion, responded to this invitation, but its action was naturally less efficacious than it would have been had it been more prompt.Generally speaking, it may fairly be claimed that the Propaganda directed by Lord North- j cliffe played an essential part in bringing about the collapse of Austria-Hungary. In addition i lo the work above outlined, members of Lord Northcliffe&apos;s department were instrumental in facilitating the recognition of the Czecho-Slovaks as an Allied and belligerent nation by the British Government. The whole experience of the Austrian section of the Enemy Propaganda Department has borne out the essential soundness of the view upon which its activities were based- that successful propaganda presupposes a clear policy ;. that policy must take into account the real and not the fancied elements in a situation ; and that such a policy is inseparable from the requirements of a just and lasting peace.In the first week of June the following correspondence passed between Mr. Balfour and I Lord Northcliffe:&quot;June 6th, 1918.&quot; My dear Mr. Balfour,&quot; In view of the critical situation in the Austro-Iiungarian army on the Italian I front, and of the urgent need for some clear declaration by the Allied Governments in I regard to the subject races of Austria-Hungary, I am much disappointed and perturbed I by the weakness of the declarations in regard to the Czecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs, ! published to-day, as having been &apos; agreed to &apos; by the three Allied Prime Ministers at E Versailles.&quot; As regards Poland, the declaration is strictly adequate, though it lacks warmth, I and is hardly calculated to produce the maximum propaganda effect.&quot; Though I have no official information as to the course of the proceedings at I Versailles, I am given to understand that the lamentable -weakness of the declarations I in regard to the Czecho-Slovaks and the Jugo-Slavs was due chiefly to the attitude of the Italian Foreign Minister, Baron Sonnino. I understand, also, that in view of this attitude the British and French Governments expressly reserved their right to supplement the Versailles declarations by more specific assurances on behalf of their respective countries. The recognition of the Bohemian National Council and of the Czecho-Slovak army by the British Government is, unless I am misinformed, an accomplished fact.&quot; Telegrams received from Italian Headquarters show the urgency of supple-mentary declarations by the British and French Governments. Unless these declarations are made, I greatly fear that the propaganda organisation I have set up in Italy may get out of hand, or break down entirely. May I therefore impress upon you very earnestly the expediency of making some public statement without delay,
147&quot; 8^ June, 1918.&quot; My dear Lord Northcliffe,&quot;I am sorry, though not surprised, that you feel disappointed by the Versailles declarations in regard to the Czecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs.&quot; What happened was this : The three Foreign Ministers met at the Quai d&apos;Orsay to deal with this among other subjects. We all felt (what is indeed fairly obvious) that it would be impossible to have two declarations on different lines dealing with the oppressed nationalities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Allied Powers could not well make one statement about Bohemia and another statement about the Southern Slavs. No doubt there are differences between the two cases, but one formula had to be found which would cover both, and the question was what that formula should be. I proposed one which would, I think, have satisfied the strongest advocates of Jugo-Slav aspirations, and have been agreeable to the Bohemians. But, while Sonnino was quite ready to accept it for the latter, he could not be induced to accept it for the former ; and nothing that M. Pichon (who agreed with me) or I could say would shake his determination.&quot; In these circumstances, we had to put up with a common formula which Sonnino would accept for the Jugo-Slavs, and which could be rendered palatable (or, at least, we hoped so) to the Bohemians by supplementary declarations to be made by the Allies separately when fitting occasions presented themselves.&quot; I understand that one such occasion will occur when the French Government present the Colours to the Czecho-Slovak troops. No such convenient opportunity seems likely to occur here for the moment, but I am telegraphing to Lord Derby asking him to inform Dr. Benes that we desire the publication of the substance of a letter which I recently sent him, and which he cordially welcomed, recognising the Bohemian National Council and the Czecho-Slovak army. I think you will agree that this form of publication will be more effective than anything we can do through the. Press Bureau.&quot; If you ask me why Baron Sonnino was so violently opposed to my draft, supported as it was by M. Pichon, I can only give you the argument which he himself developed at great length and with considerable reiteration. It was that only some 5 per cent, or, at most, 10 per cent, of the Jugo-Slavs desired to be independent of Austria and were prepared to fight for such independence. The other 90 per cent, or 95 per cent., he stated, favoured autonomy within the Austrian Empire. Any declaration, therefore, which mentioned the word &apos; independence &apos; alienated this great majority of the Jugo-Slavs, thereby strengthening Austria. These figures are, of course, vehemently combated by other experts ; but, in the face of Baron Sonnino&apos;s statement, it was most difficult for us to take any course which would lay us open to the accusation of definitely rejecting Italian advice on a subject with which, Italy is primarily and most intimately concerned. Nor could we take any course which would advertise to a mocking world a fundamental difference of opinion between Italy on the one side and of authorising the issue of instructions through the Press Bureau to the press in such terms as may reassure our Czecho-Slovak and Jugo-Slav friends, and encourage them to preseverc in the valuable work they have been doing, and are disposed increasingly to do.&quot; Believe me, dear Mr. Balfour,&quot; Yours very sincerely,&quot; NORTHCLIFFE.&quot;
arid France and England on the other about an important point of policy. Let mil add that we can defend the declaration to our Jugo-Slav friends by saying (quite truly) that it was in strict conformity with Mr. Lansing&apos;s statement, and that American opinion will scarcely go beyond this at present. ...&quot; The Polish declaration was deliberately made concise. The three points it contains are those which appeal to all Poles, and the frigid isolation in which they are presented will not, I think, diminish the impression which they are likely to produce, The warmth of sympathy which we-all feel for Polish aspirations Ends, perhaps, its most appropriate channel of communication in public speeches ; it is not easy to express it in a joint declaration, composed, if not published, in three different languages!&quot; Yours very sincerely,&quot; ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR.&quot;Then we urged that the British and French Governments should do all in their power to improve the situation. Telegrams were sent by the Foreign Office to Lord Derby and M. Pichon, and it was arranged that when the Colours were presented to the Polish Legion and the Czecho-Slovak Legion in France there should be some declaration by the French to include the Jugo-Slavs definitely.In the meantime Mr. Lansing, influenced, possibly, by the attitude of the Southern Slavs in the United States, came out with a definite statement that the United States aimed at the complete liberation of all Slav peoples from Austro-German domination. This had the effect of taking the leadership out of the hands of Italy, where it had been placed by the Rome Congress, and of putting it into the hands of the United States.Simultaneously, we were directly interested in the Czecho-Slovak forces in Siberia. This question had been discussed by us at Versailles in April, when we drew up a plan, with the assent of Dr. Benes, Secretary-General of the Bohemian National Council, for sending some of the! Czecho-Slovak troops up to Archangel and Murman, and getting those East of the Urals to: Vladivostock, and arranging transport for them. The later developments in Siberia are matters of public knowledge. The courageous action of the Czecho-Slovaks was most excellent propaganda.While these things were going on came the great Austrian offensive against Italy, which had been planned for April, and which did not come off, mainly on account of Allied propaganda. Then it was planned for June, and was delayed about ten days. This delay proved, to be very important, because when the Austrian offensive came, the Piave rose behind the Austrian army and converted the attack into something like a disaster. The question is how far the Austrian offensive was influenced by our propaganda and the attitude of the subject races. There is reason to believe that many ammunition dumps behind the lines were blown up by the Czechs, A rumour was spread in the press that the Southern Slavs had been fighting desperately against Italy, but this was officially denied. The divisions in question were a mixture of Germans, Magyars, Poles and Ruthencs. It appeared that the Southern Slav divisions had. been divided up and mixed with &quot; reliable &quot; troops, which showed that the Austrians were afraid of them. The prisoners taken, as a rule, expressed willingness to volunteer at once. Dalmatian prisoners showed great enthusiasm for Jugo-Slavia and the Allies.In spite, therefore, of a reactionary tendenc)^ in Italy to break away from the decisions of the Rome Congress, and to discredit the Southern Slavs, the pressure of events caused progress. General Badoglio, the Italian Chief of Staff, took an excellent line in regard to propaganda. Representations were made to General Diaz, the Commander-in-Chief, and we gradually got the better of the obstructionist tendency.During July we received clear proof of the efficacy of the propaganda against Austria-Hungary, in the arrival of deserters belonging to the subject races, in the Italian lines, bringing
with them the manifestoes and saying : &quot;I have come because you invited me.&quot; Unfortunately, the full effect was lost owing to the refusal of the Italian Government to allow the Jugo-Slavs and Rumanians to form their Volunteer Legions, and its insistence upon retaining them in internment camps, despite constant appeals both from officers and men.It was proposed to hold a second Congress of Austro-Hungarian Subject Races in Paris on July 25th, in order to continue the work inaugurated in Rome, but at the last moment it had to be postponed. In this connection the Department conferred with M. Franklin-Bouillon, President of the French Foreign Office Committee, the Roumanian statesman, Mr. Take Jonescu, and others.The services of a well-known Trahsylvanian-Rumanian were secured, with a view to establishing constant and intimate contact with the Rumanian Committee in Paris ; and this contact became steadily closer after the arrival of several other Transylvanian leaders after running the Bolshevist gauntlet in Russia.   A Slav agent was also established in Stockholm.Unfortunately, during July and August, the position in Padua became less favourable, and, as a result of the narrow attitude adopted by the Italian representatives there, the Polish delegate, M. Zamorski, withdrew altogether, while the Roumanian and Jugo-Slav delegates became more and more reserved, and, indeed, only consented to remain at all in view of their cordial personal relations with Colonel Granville Baker. It was the need for clearing up this situation which was one of the reasons for convoking the inter-allied Propaganda Conference in August.When the collapse of Bulgaria took place, not a moment was lost in using the new field of operations thus opened out against Austria-Hungary ; and it was decided to establish a Propaganda Commission on the Balkan front on lines similar to the Padua Commission, though, of course, adapted to the new circumstances. Colonel Granville Baker was despatched to Salonica, and arrangements were already being made for the printing and distribution of leaflets (a few were actually used) and the despatch of a small expert staff which would be in specially close touch with the Jugo-Slavs and Roumanians as border races. Fortunately, however, events altogether out-distanced these preparations. The dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the achievement of Czecho-Slovak, Jugo-Slav, Polish and Roumanian aspirations for unity tendered the further work of the Department superfluous.The effect of the propaganda carried out against Austria-Hungary conclusively proved the accuracy of the conception upon which the work of this Department was grounded from the first i.e., that propaganda is comparatively useless unless it be based on a sound policy and unless it works definitely as an agency for the application of that policy. The delay of the Allied Governments in adopting a clear policy towards Austria-Hungary .was undoubtedly responsible for the prolongation of the war. As soon as propaganda began upon the basis of J clear policy, its efficacy became apparent, above all because it was not confined to local, mani-fctations, but embraced undertakings as important as the Rome Congress, which was probably the largest piece of propaganda organised by the Allies during the whole war. General Diaz, the Italian Commander-in-chief, repeatedly expressed to Allied propagandists his sense of the services which they had rendered, and he attributed the Piave victory at the end of June in &apos;o small degree to their efforts. This testimonial was soon afterwards publicly confirmed by the admissions of the Austro-Hungarian High Command.(335)c
GERMANY.From the date of Lord NorthclittVs appointment until the month of May, propagand in Germany was left in the hands of those who had been charged with it up to that tim Mr. S. A. Guest continued the work he had ably organised of securing the circulation in German of books, pamphlets, newspaper articles, and information in every form. A department of ti War Office (M.I. 7 B.4) went on preparing leaflets to be dropped by balloons over the Germa lines. Captain Chalmers Mitchell, F.R.S., attached to this department of the War Office, ha for a long time been engaged in studying German propagandist literature, and early in 191 the War Office had issued an analysis from his pen of over two thousand books and pamphlet of enemy origin. In the middle of 1917 a sub-section (M.I. 7 B.4), under the charge of Captai Mitchell, was constituted with the duty of preparing propaganda suitable for the Wester Front. This sub-section now carried on until Crewe House was ready to begin on propagand in Germany and among the German troops. It sent out reproductions of letters written b prisoners of war, Le Counter de I&apos;Air a weekly news sheet for French and Belgian civilians ii districts occupied by the Germany Army and a series of leaflets, begun in March, 1918; o which, during six months, some twelve millions were sent to France.On May 14th, Mr. H. G. Wells, who had joined the Committee at Lord Northcliffe&apos;s invita tion, agreed to direct propaganda against Germany with the co-operation of Dr. J. W. Headlani Morley. The first task to which they devoted themselves was the drawing-up of a statement o policy. Mr. Wells submitted a memorandum on this subject at the meeting of the Committei on May 27th, and on May 31st this was discussed at length, with the result that the Committei decided to draft a letter to be addressed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, with tin object of drawing the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the urgent need of a publii declaration of policy, and to the difficulty of carrying on effective propaganda unless it wa supported by such a declaration.The document upon which the Committee decided to base this letter was the following:&quot; PREFACE.&quot; Propaganda in Germany, as in other enemy countries, must obviously be based upon a clear Allied policy. Hitherto Allied policy and Allied war aims have beer: defined too loosely to be comprehensible to the Germans.&quot; The real war aim of the Allies is not only to beat the enemy but to establish a world peace that shall preclude the resumption of war. Successful propagand;!. in Germany presupposes the clear definition Of the kind of world-settlement which the Allies are determined to secure and the place of Germany in it.&quot; The points to be brought home to the Germans are : &apos;; 1. The determination of the Allies to continue the war until Germany accepts the Allied peace settlement.&quot; 2. The existing alliance as a Fighting League of Free Nations will be deepened and extended, and the military, naval, financial and economic resources of its members will be pooled until &quot; (a) Its military purpose is achieved, and&quot; (b) Peace is established on lasting foundations.&quot; German minds are particularly susceptible to systematic statements. They are accustomed to discuss and to understand co-ordinated projects. The ideas representatives sented by the phrases &apos; Berlin-Baghdad &apos; and &apos; Mitteleuropa &apos; have been fully explained to them and now form the bases of German political thought. Other projects, repre-sented by &apos; Berlin-Teheran&apos; and &apos; Berlin-Tokyo&apos; are becoming familiar to them Against these ideas the Allies have not yet set up any comprehensive and compre hensible scheme of world-organisation.  There is no allied counterpart to Naumann&apos;
&apos; Mitteleuropa&apos; which the neutral and the German Press could discuss as a practical proposition. This counterpart should be created without delay by competent Allied writers. It would form an effective basis for propaganda, and would work automatically.&quot; It follows that one of the first requisites is to study and to lay down the lines of a practical League of Free Nations. The present alliance must be taken as the nucleus of any such League. Its control of raw materials, of shipping, and its power to exclude for an indefinite period enemy or even neutral peoples until they subscribe to and give pledges of their acceptance of its principles should be emphasized. It should be pointed out that nothing stands between enemy peoples and a lasting peace except the pre-datory designs of their ruling dynasties and military and economic castes ; that the design of the Allies is not to crush any people, but to assure the freedom of all on a basis of self-determination to lie exercised under definite guarantees of justice and fair play; that, unless enemy peoples accept the Allied conception of a world peace settlement, it will be impossible for them to repair the havoc of the present war, to avert, utter financial ruin, and to save themselves from prolonged misery; and that the longer the struggle lasts the deeper will become the hatred of everything German in the non-German world, and the heavier the social and economic handicap under which the enemy peoples will labour, even after their admission into a League of Nations.&quot; The primary war aim of the Allies thus becomes the changing of Germany, not only in the interest of the Allied League but in that of the German people itself, Without the honest co-operation of Germany disarmament on a large scale would be impossible, and without disarmament social and economic reconstruction would be impracticable. Germany has, therefore, to choose between her own permanent ruin by adhering to her present system of government and policy and the prospect of economic and political redemption by over-throwing her militarist system so as to be able to join honestly in the Allied scheme of world organisation.&quot;&quot; MEMORANDUM.&quot; It has become manifest that for the purposes of an efficient pro-Ally propaganda in neutral and enemy countries a clear and full statement of the war aims of the Allies is vitally necessary. What is wanted is something in the nature of an authoritative text to which propagandists may refer with confidence and which can be made the standard of their activities. It is not sufficient to recount the sins of Germany and to assert that the defeat of Germany is the Allied war aim. What all the world desires to know is what is to happen after the war. The real war aim of a belligerent, it is more and more understood, is not merely victory, but a peace of a certain character which that belligerent desires shall arise out of that victory. What, therefore, is the peace sought by the Allies ?&quot; It would be superfluous even to summarise here the primary case of the Allies, that the war is on their part a war to resist the military aggression of Germany, assisted by the land-owning Magyars of Hungary, the Turks, and the King of Bulgaria, upon the rest of mankind. It is a war against belligerence, against aggressive war, and the preparation for aggressive war. Such it was in its beginning, and such it remains. But it would be idle to pretend that the ideas of the Governments and peoples allied against Germany have not developed very greatly during the years of the war. There has been a deepening realisation of the danger to mankind of existing political divisions and separations, a great experience in the suffering, destruction, and waste of war; a quickening of consciences against conquests, annexations, and subjugations; and a general clearing up of ideas that have hitherto stood in the way of an organised world peace. While German Imperialism, to judge by the utterances of its accredited heads, and by the behaviour of Germany in the temporarily disorganised States on her EasternC2
front, is still as truculent, aggressive, and treacherous as ever, the mind of her anta riists has learnt and has matured.  There has arisen in the great world outside inner lives of the Central Powers a will that grows to gigantic proportions, that altogetl overshadows the boasted will to power of the German junker and exploiter, the to a world peace.   It is like the will of an experience man set against the will of obstinate and selfish youth.   The war aims of the anti-German Allies take more more definitely the form of a world of States leagued together to maintain a comrn law, to submit their mutual differences to a conclusive tribunal, to protect weak co munities, to restrain and suppress war threats and war preparations throughout earth.-&quot; Steadfastly the great peoples of the world outside the shadow of German Imper domination have been working their way to unanimity, while the ruling intelligent of Germany have been scheming for the base advantages of conquest, while they ha been undermining, confusing, and demoralising the mentality of Russia, crushi down the subject peoples of the Austro-Hungarian Imperialism, and threatening ai cajoling neutrals there has been a wide, free movement in the minds of their antagora towards the restraint and wisdom of a greater and nobler phase in human affair The thought of the world crystallizes now about a phrase, the phrase &apos; The League Free Nations.&apos; The war aims of the Allies become more and more explicitly associal with the spirit and implications of that.&quot; Like all such phrases &apos; The League of Free Nations &apos; is subject to a great varif of detailed interpretation, but its broad intentions can now be stated without mi risk of dissent. The ideal would, of course, include all the nations of the earth, eluding a Germany purged of her military aggressiveness; it involves some sort INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS that can revise, codify, amend and extend in! national law, a supreme Court of Law in which States may sue and be sued, and wh( decision the League will be pledged to enforce, and the supervision, limitation, a use of armaments under the direction of the international congress. It is also felt ve widely that such a congress must set a restraint upon competitive and unsanction &apos; expansionist&apos; movements into unsettled and disordered regions, must act as t guardian of feeble races and communities, and must be empowered to make conclusions decisions upon questions of transport, tariffs, access to raw material, migration, ai international intercourse generally. The constitution of this congress remains indefinit it is the crucial matter upon which the best thought of the world is working at t present time. But given the prospect of a suitable congress there can be little dispi that the great Imperial Powers among the Allies are now prepared for gre and generous limitations of their sovereignty in the matter of armaments, of tropic possessions and of subject peoples, in the common interest of mankind. The spectac of German Imperialism, boastful, selfish, narrow, and altogether hateful, in its territ blood-dance through Europe, has been an object-lesson to humanity against excess of national vanity and national egotism and against Imperial pride. Among t Allies the two chief Imperial Powers measured by the extent of territory they contr are Britain and France, and each of these is more completely prepared to-day tha ever it has been before to consider its imperial possessions as a trust for their inhabitar. and for mankind, and its position in the more fertile and less settled regions of the worl as that of a mandatory and trustee. These admissions involve a plain prospect an promise of the ultimate release and liberation of all the peoples in these great an variegated Empires to complete world-citizenship.&quot; But in using the phrase &apos; The League of Nations,&apos; it may be well to dispel certain misconceptions that have arisen through the experimental preparation by more less irresponsible persons and societies of elaborate schemes and constitutions of six a league.   Proposals have been printed and published, for example, of a court  World Conciliation, in which each sovereign State will be represented by one member-
Montenegro, for example, by one, and the British Empire by one -and other proposals have been mooted of a Congress of the League of Nations, in which such States as Hayti, Abyssinia, and the like will be represented by one or two two representatives, and France and Great Britain by five or six. All such projects should be put out of mind when the phrase &apos; League of Free Nations&apos; is used by responsible speakers for the Allied Powers. Certain most obvious considerations have evidently been over-looked by the framers of such proposals. It will, for example, be a manifest dis-advantage to the smaller Powers to be at all over-represented upon the Congress of any such League; it may even be desirable that certain of them should not have a voting representative at all, for this reason, that a great Power still cherishing an aggressive spirit would certainly attempt, as the beginning of its aggression, to compel adjacent small Powers to send representatives practically chosen by itself. The coarse fact of the case in regard to an immediate world peace is this, that only five or six great Powers possess sufficient economic resources to make war under modern conditions at the present time; namely, the United States of America, Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and, doubtfully, Austria-Hungary. Italy suffers under the disadvantage that she has no coal supply. These five or six Powers we may say, therefore, permit war and can prevent it. They are at present necessarily the cus-todians of the peace of the world, and it is mere pedantry not to admit that this gives them a practical claim to preponderance in the opening Congress of the World League. It may be pointed out that a small State with a voice in the discussions but no vote in the decisions of the League would logically be excused from the liability to assist in enforcing those decisions.&quot; But this question of the constitution of a world Congress is not to be solved by making a coarse classification of States into large and war-capable Powers, and small and weak Powers. Take the case of Italy, for example : though she is almost incapable of sustaining a war against the world by herself because of her weakness in the matter of coal, she can as an ally be at once of enormous importance. Take the case of Spain again, a very similar case. And whatever the war ability of Latin-America may be to-day, there can be no question that this great constellation of States must count very heavily in the framing of the world of to-morrow. Then, again, we have to consider the vast future possibilities of the Chinese Republic, with coal, steel, and a magnificent industrial population, and the probable reconstruction of Eastern Europe and a renascence of Russia which may give the world a loose-knit but collectively-important Slavonic confederation. While an isolated small Power within the orbit of attraction of a large Power, a State of 5,000,000 people or less, must always remain a difficult problem in the world representation. It is clear that something like an adequate representation of small and weak Powers becomes possible so soon as they develop a disposition towards aggregation, for the purposes of world politics, into associations with States racially, linguistically, and historically akin to them. The trend of Allied opinion is to place not Peru or Ukrania, nor Norway, nor Finland on a level with the United States of America or the British Empire at the League of Nations Congress, but to prepare the way for adequate representation through a preliminary Latin-America.or a Slavonic or a Scandinavian Confederation, which could speak with a common idea at the World Congress.&quot; It should be manifest that there is one Power whose splendid achievement in this war, and whose particular needs, justify her over-representation (as measured by material, wealth, or millions of population) upon the Congress of the League, and that is France. It is open to question whether Italy should not also be disproportionately over-represented, seeing that she will not have, as Spain will have, the moral reinforce-ment of kindred nations over seas. And with regard to the British Empire, seeing that there exists no real Imperial legislature, it is open to consideration whether Canada, South Africa, and Australasia shouW come into the Council as separate nationalities.
The Asiatic and African possessions of Britain and France, Belgium and Italy, posses-sions, that is, which have no self-government, might possibly for a time be represented by members appointed by the governing power in each case. These are merely sugges-tions here, indications of a disposition of mind, but they are suggestions upon which it is necessary for the Allied Powers to decide as speedily as possible. The effective working out of this problem of the League of Nations Congress by the Allies without undue delay is as vital a part of the Allied policy as the effective conduct of the war.&quot; It has to be recognised that the institution of a League of Nations precludes any annexations or any military interference with any peoples whatever, without a man-date from the Congress of the League. The League must directly or indirectly become the guardian of all unsettled regions and order must be kept and development promoted by it in such derelict regions as Mesopotamia and&apos; Armenia, for example, have now become. In these latter instances it is open to consideration whether the League should operate through some single power acting as a mandatory of the League, of else by international forces under the control of the League as a whole. Theoretically the latter course is to be preferred, but there are enormous practical advantages in many cases to be urged for the former. The Allies have indeed had a considerable experience during the war of joint controls and joint expeditions ; there has been a great education in internationalism since August, 1914 ; but nevertheless the end ol the war is likely to come long before any real international forces have been evolved, It is, however, towards the ultimate use of international forces in such cases that the joint policy of the Allies is plainly and openly directed.&quot; The bringing of the League into practical politics profoundly effects the question of territorial adjustment after the war. The Allies are bound in honour to follow the will of France in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, and the rectification of the Italian frontier and the bringing of the bulk of the Italian-speaking population, now under Austrian dominion, into one ring-fence with Italy, also seem a necessary part of a world pacification. It is, however, of far less importance in the war aims of the Allies that this and that particular scrap of territory should change hands from the control of one group of combatants to that of the other, than that the present practical ascendency of German Imperialism over the resources of the Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Czech, Jugo-Slav, Finnish, and Roumanian peoples should cease. The war aims of the Allies in Eastern Europe is to create in the place of the present Austro-Hungarian Empire a larger synthesis of associated States, something in the nature of an &quot; East Central European League,&quot; within the League of Nations, a confederation that might possibly reach from Poland to the Black and Adriatic Seas, and have also access to, if not a port upon, the Baltic at Danzig. The Allies are necessarily obliged to wait upon the development of affairs in Russia, but the hopes and efforts of the Allies are towards a reconciliation of at least Great Russia, Siberia, and Ukrainia into a working association within the League. It is premature to speculate upon the grouping of Finland at the present time. Relieved of the feverish and impossible ambitions the political weaknesses of these peoples have stimulated, a free and united Germany could then become one of the predominant partners in the World League of Free Nations. The Allies do not propose an unconditional return of the former African possessions of Germany, but they contemplate an over-ruling international regime in Africa between the Sahara and the Zambesi, restraining armament, reorganising native education, and giving absolute equality of trade to all the nations in the League. Such an international regime under the League may not be incompatible with the retention of national flags in the former &apos; possessions &apos; of the leagued Powers.&quot; Exact territorial definition does not appear to the Allies to be of nearly such importance as the establishment of a common system of disarmament and a common effort to restore the ravages of the war. The full effect of the war is still not realised by the mass of the belligerent peoples, more especially in America and Western Europe
when; life is still fairly comfortable. There has already been a destruction not merely of the political, but of the social order over great areas of the world, especially in Eastern Europe, and it is doubtful whether any peace can restore these disorganised areas to anything like their former productively for many years. A universal shortage not merely of man-power, but of transport and machinery available for the purposes of peace cannot be avoided. It is doubtful, moreover, if social discipline in the ports of the British Empire and America will be strong enough to restrain an organised resistance to the use of German shipping after the war for any purpose and to the use of Allied shipping for the transport of goods to and from Germany on the part of Allied and neutral seamen and transport workers indignant at the U-boat campaign ; moreover, there is a world-wide cry for a vindictive trade after the war against Germany, and for organised boycotts that may further restrict the process of economic world recovery. It is doubtful if the menace of these &apos; revenge &apos; movements and the difficulty of control-ling them in democratic States is properly appreciated in Germany. The militarist Government of Germany, fighting now for bare existence, is concealing from its people this world-wide disposition to boycott German trade and industry at any cost to the boycotting populations, and buoying them up with preposterous hopes of&apos; business as usual&apos; as soon as peace is made. The fact has to be faced that while the present German Government remains no such economic resumption is possible. The &apos; War after the War &apos; possibility has to be added to the economic destruction in Russia, Belgium, and elsewhere in any estimate of the situation after the war.&quot; The plain prospect of material disorganisation thus opened should alone suffice to establish the absolute necessity for peace now of such a nature as will permit a world-wide concentration upon reconstruction, in good faith and without any complications of enmity and hostility. But in addition to the material destruction and dislocation, and to the &apos; hatred&apos; disorganisation already noted, the financial transactions of the last few years have created a monetary inflation which, without the concerted action of all the Powers, may mean a collapse of world credit. Add now the plain necessity for continued armament if a real League of Nations is not attained. Without any exaggera-tion the prospect of the nations facing these economics difficulties in an atmosphere of continuing hostility, intrigue, and conflict, under a continuing weight of armaments, and with a continuing distrust, is a hopeless one. The consequences stare us in the face ; Russia is only the first instance of what must happen generally. The alternative to a real League of Nations is the steady descent of our civilisation towards a condition of political and social fragmentation such as the world has not seen since the fall of the Roman Empire. The honest co-operation of Germany in the League of Nations, in disarmament, and in world reconstruction is, therefore, fundamentally necessary. There is now no other rational policy. And since it is impossible to hope for any such help or co-operation from the Germany of the Belgian outrage, the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the betrayal of Ukrainia, THE CHANGING OF GERMANY becomes a primary war aim, the primary war aim for the Allies. How Germany is to be changed is a complex question. The word Revolution is, perhaps, to be deprecated. We do not, for instance, desire a Bolshevik breakdown in Germany, which would make her economically useless to mankind. We look, therefore, not so much to the German peasant and labourer as to the ordinary, fairly well-educated mediocre German for co-operation in the reinstatement of civilisation. Change there must be in Germany; in the spirit in which the Government is conducted, in the persons who exercise the control, and in the relative influence of different classes in the country. The sharpest distinction, therefore, has to be drawn between Germany and its present Government in all our propaganda and public utterances; and a constant appeal has to be made by the statesmen of the Alliance, and by a frank and open propaganda through the Germans of the United States of America and of Switzerland, through neutral countries and by every possible means, from Germany junker to Germany sober. We may be inclined to believe that every German is something of a Junker, we have to remember he is also potentially a reasonable man.
&quot; And meanwhile, the Allies must continue with haste and diligence to fight an defeat Junker Germany, which cannot possibly conquer but which may neverthcles succeed in ruining the world. They must fight the German armies upon the front; they must light an unregenerate Germany economically and politically, and they mus bring home to the German reason and conscience at home, by an intensive air war an by propaganda alike, the real impossibility of these conceptions of national pride an aggressiveness in which the German population has been bred.&quot;The letter, based upon this document and addressed by Lord Northcliifc to the Secretary f State for&quot;Foreign Affairs, under date June 10th, was in these terms :&quot; My dear Mr. Balfour,&quot; I wish to submit to you the following general scheme of policy as a basis fo. British and eventually Allied propaganda in Germany. Propaganda, as an activ form of policy, must be in harmony with the settled war aims of the Allies : &quot; 1. The object of all propaganda is to weaken the will of the enemy to war an victory. For this purpose it is necessary to put in the forefront the ultimate object o the Allies, and the use which they would make of victory, for this is the matter will which the Germans are most concerned. We cannot, of course, expect that the wa aims of the Allies should be determined solely by the effect which they may have upo the German people, but, on the other hand, it is clearly undesirable to put forward fo propaganda purposes objects which it is not really intended to secure. It appears t( me, however, that our war aims, as I understand them, are such as could, if presente in a suitable form, be made to do something to strengthen whatever &apos; opposition exists in Germany.&quot; 2. From such information as is available as to the internal condition of German; two points emerge which are of the greatest importance for immediate purposes :  &quot; (a) There is much evidence that the German people as a whole desire above all a cessation of the war. They are suffering more than their opponents, and wai weariness has advanced further with them than it has with us. They acquiesce in the continuance of the present offensive chiefly because they are assured by their leaders that this is the only way in which a speedy peace can be achieved. It is, therefore, necessary to impress upon them that they are face to face with a deter-mined and immutable will on the part of Allied nations to continue the war at whatever cost, notwithstanding German military successes, and that for this reason military success is not the way to bring about the peace they desire. It must be made plain that we arc prepared to continue a ruthless policy of commercial blockade.&quot; (b) Side by side with this we have another motive of the highest importance. One of the chief instruments of the German Government is the belief which they foster that any peace that the Allies would, if they had their way, impose would mean the internal ruin of Germany, and this again would mean that each individual German family would find itself without work, without money, and without food. As against this it is necessary to impress on the German nation that these results might happen, but that they can be avoided. They will happen if the Government of Germany continues to carry out its openly avowed design of subjecting the other free nations of Europe to its domination. They can be avoided if the German nation will resign these projects of domination and consent to accept the Allied scheme for a new organisation of the world.&quot; These two points [a) and (b) must be kept in close connection ; the first provides the element of fear, the second provides the element of hope.&quot;3. The.first point presents no difficulty to us ; we can go ahead in full confidence that we are in harmony with both the nation and the Government. As to the second, on the other hand, I must ask for your guidance and support.   Hitherto Allied policy
and war aims have been defined too loosely to be comprehensible to the Germans, and there have been apparent inconsistencies, of which they have quickly taken advantage. Moreover, it has been possible for German writers to misrepresent our war aims as dictated by Imperialistic ambitions, similar in kind to those by which they are them-selves actuated, and involving &apos; annexations and indemities,&apos; such as have in the past been too often the result of victory in war. I take it that the real object of the Allies is, after defeating Germany, to establish such a world peace as shall, within the limits of human foresight, preclude another conflagration. It seems necessary, therefore, that the separate aims which would, of course, be maintained, such as the restoration of Belgium, the liberation of Alsace-Lorraine, the establishment of civilised government in Mesopotamia and Palestine, should be put forward in their proper places asdndividual but essential points in the general scheme for the settlement of world politics on a basis which would go far to remove the causes of future wars.&quot; 4. Any such scheme would, in effect, amount to the constitution of a &apos; League of Free Nations.&apos; It is, I presume, generally understood that eventually Germany would be invited to take her place in such a League on condition that she accepted the principles of its foundation. Pier admission to the League would be in itself her guarantee against the establishment of, eg., a hostile monopoly of raw materials. Our terms of peace, therefore, can be represented as the conditions on which Germany should be invited to take her part in such a League. In order to secure the economic benefits she would have to accept the political conditions. If this is so, the task of propaganda is greatly lightened, for it would be easier to put our aims in such a form as to make them to some extent acceptable to the moderate elements in Germany than if they were put forward merely as terms to be imposed on a defeated enemy.&quot; 5. It is, however, obvious that propaganda conducted on these lines will be of little use unless it is supported by public and authoritative statements from the Allied Governments. Otherwise, it would be represented that the real object is to beguile Germany into accepting a peace of renunciation, and that, as soon as this object has been achieved, these schemes will be repudiated, and a weakened Germany will find herself face to face with an Anglo-Saxon combination which aims at dominating the world, and keeping Germany permanently in a position of political and commercial inferiority.&quot; 6. No such statement has yet been made, so far as I am aware, by the British Government or by the Allies. What, therefore, I should venture to ask is for such support from you as will enable us to carry on bur work with the full consciousness that we have behind us the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government. If it were known that the Government itself, in conjunction with the Allies, was investigating the problem with a view to speedy action, this knowledge would give a great and needed incentive to the more popular work which we should be doing.&quot;7. I am well aware of the very great practical difficulties which are bound to arise so soon as an attempt is made to give formal expression to the general idea of a &apos; League of Free Nations.&apos; But for the purposes of our work, it is of the most urgent importance that some statement of this kind should be put forward at the earliest possible date.. Such a statement would in effect be an offer to the Germans of peace on stated conditions. If if were accepted, Germany would be able shortly after the conclusion of the war to come into the. new society of nations ; if it were refused, the war would have to continue. But it should also be made clear to the German people that the privilege of admission to this society would inevitably be postponed for a period proportional to the length of time that they continued the war.&quot; Believe me, dear Mr. Balfour,&quot; Yours very sincerely,&quot; NORTHCLIFFE.&quot;D
In reply Mr. Balfour wrote :&quot;June 11//*, 1918.&quot; My dear Lord Northcliffe,&quot; Your important letter on propaganda in Germany must, I think be brought before the Cabinet. On a cursory reading, I can say that I am in general agreement with the line of thought, but I notice that you make no specific mention of a very difficult question the German colonies.&quot; Yours sincerely,&quot;ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR.&quot;To this the following rejoinder was made by Lord Northcliffe :&quot;June \3th, 1918.&quot;&quot;My dear Mr. Balfour,&quot; I am glad to know that you are in general agreement with the line of though) developed in my letter on Propaganda in Germany.&quot; You notice, however, that my letter makes no specific mention of the German colonies. I have read with great interest, and, if I may say so without impertinence with admiration, your extremely able Cabinet paper on this subject. I have no settled views as to the future of what were the German colonies, beyond a very strong conviction that they must never again be allowed to fall, for any military or naval purpose, undei German control. But, broadly, my feeling is this: The whole situation of the Allies in regard to Germany is governed by the fact that Germany is responsible for the war The Allies are, therefore, entitled to demand from her restitution, reparation, and guarantees as preliminary conditions of any peace settlement. The territories whicl the Allies have taken from Germany in the course of their legitimate self-defence d( not come into the same category as the territories seized by Germany, and the allies ol Germany, in the course of their predatory aggression. To contemplate barter oi exchange between one set of territories and the other would be to assimilate, by implications tion, the moral situation of the Allies to that of Germany. Therefore, however closely we may study the question, or rather the questions for there are several of thf German colonies, we ought to make it clear that the ultimate settlement of those qua tions will be reserved for treatment by the Allies as a fighting league of free nations, or by the general League of Nations should the behaviour of Germany entitle her to admission to it in time to take part in any scheme of world reorganisation.&quot; Believe me, dear Mr. Balfour,&quot; Yours very sincerely,&quot; NORTHCLIFFE.&quot;Lord Northcliffe&apos;s letter came in due course before the War Cabinet, and was approved as a basis of policy for propaganda, though no public declaration was made.Meanwhile Mr. Wells had been laying bases for work upon the lines suggested. He kepi closely in touch with the associations formed to promote a League of Nations. He took up the idea of setting before the German people a vision of a new Germany which should renounce aims of world-domination and return to peaceful and beneficent activities in the fields of art, science and industry, with which the greatest names in German history were honourably associated Mr. Wells also set on foot a systematic collection of facts bearing upon the application in Great Britain of science to industry ; the object of this was to show the Germans that we were emanci-pating ourselves from dependence upon them in the matter of products of scientific manufactureMr. Wells, however, was not able long to continue his work. On July 17th he offered his resignation, which was accepted by the Committee on July 23rd, and Mr. Hamilton Fyfe was appointed organiser and conductor of German Propaganda in his stead.
A few days later Crewe House took over the work of preparing leaflets, done hitherto by M. I. 7 b.4 at Adastral House, and was fortunate in being able to profit by the experience and resourcefulness of Captain P. Chalmers Mitchell, who was transferred from Adastral House to the Enemy Propaganda Department, and who soon became Liaison Officer between that department and the War Office. Now it was possible for the German branch at Crewe House to make its own printing arrangements, and in his first fortnightly report to the Committee on August 6th, Mr. Hamilton Fyfe was able to announce that daily bulletins of war news and leaflets explaining to the Germans the hopelessness of continuing the struggle would be produced with the same speed as that of a daily newspaper and dispatched to France for distribution by toy balloons within forty-eight hours of their being written. This called for rapid work on the part of the printers, Messrs. Harrison &amp; Son, and at Messrs. Gamage&apos;s where the leaflets were attached to the balloon &quot; releases &quot; ; their co-operation was willingly given, and was a most valuable aid.The balloons employed were made of paper cut in longitudinal panels, with a neck of oiled silk about 18 inches long. Their diameter was approximately twenty feet, and their height when inflated eight feet. They were inflated nearly to their full capacity, being sent up with from 90 to 95 cubic feet of hydrogen. &quot;The weight of the balloon was under one pound, and the weight of propaganda just over four pounds. The propaganda leaflets were attached to a fuse of treated cotton, similar to that used in flint pipelighters, and burning at the rate of an inch every five minutes. The string of the leaflets was fastened to the neck of the balloon, and just before liberation a slit was cut in the neck to allow for the escape of gas, and the end of the fuse was lighted. The weights were adjusted so that the balloon rose sharply into the air to- a height of several thousand feet before the- loss of gas due to expansion would have destroyed the free lift. At this point the first bundle of leaflets was liberated from the fuse, and this process continued until the end of the run, when the last bundle was released.The total time length of the fuse and the attachment of the propaganda to it were calculated according to the area which it was desired to reach, and the average strength of the wind. The experimental improvement of the &quot; dope &quot; with which the paper was treated in order to prevent loss of gas by diffusion, and the manufacture of balloons of double the standard capacity, had placed runs of upwards of 150 miles well within the capacity of the method before the Armistice suspended operations, but the bulk of the propaganda was distributed over an area of from ten to fifty miles behind the Enemy Lines.The distribution unit at the Front consisted of two motor lorries, which carried the balloons, hydrogen cylinders, and personnel to a convenient spot, generally from three to five miles behind the front line. Thence the balloons were sent up. Fortunately, during the late summer and autumn the wind was almost consistently favourable for their, dispatch.In the beginning of August it became important to increase the speed of distribution, particularly because early news of the military successes of the Allies, concealed by the Germans from their own troops, became valuable propaganda. It was therefore arranged that the leaflets should be divided into two categories, &quot; stock &quot; leaflets, the contents of which would not lose their value by a little delay, and &quot; priority &quot; leaflets, containing matter of urgent importance. It was agreed that the latter should be printed three times a week, each leaflet being of uniform length and printed in an edition of 100,000 copies. The issue and rapid dispatch of these con-tinued from August until the signing of the Armistice. Of the stock leaflets produced by Crewe House, over nine millions were attached to releases and sent to France between August and November.During the month of August, then, the number of leaflets dropped over the German lines and behind them reached a figure well over 100,000 a day. Written in simple language, they aimed at letting the Germans know the truth which was being concealed from them by their leaders. They gave information as to the progress of the war in all theatres, and showed at a glance the territory gained by the Associated Nations by means of shaded maps. Great stress was laid upon the large numbers of troops arriving daily from the United States. By the use of diagrams, the steadily progressive increase of the American forces was strikingly illustrated. German losses were insisted upon, and the futility of making further sacrifices in a losing cause.I   (335) D2
The leaflets were infinite in their variety. They appealed now to reason, now to the instinct ol self-preservation, now to religious sentiment, they dealt also with political questions of interest to the German rank and file.The large number of prisoners taken with leaflets in their pockets proved that these were doing their work. The German commanders issued orders against their being read. Some offered rewards for all leaflets handed to officers. Others threatened punishment if they were not given up.  This is an example of the notices which appeared in German Army Orders :&quot; ORDERS REGARDING PROPAGANDA LEAFLETS.&quot; The distribution of propaganda leaflets from English aeroplanes and balloons has of late considerably increased.&quot; It is the duty of every officer and man to immediately hand in such leaflets to his unit.&quot; Any officer or man found to be in possession of such leaflets after their having been found, or attempting to send same home, is to be very severely dealt with.&quot;(From Standing Orders of the 11th. Reserve Division.)An equally severe warning was given by the Deputy Commander of the Seventh Army Corps in the Dusseldorfer Nachrichten of September 22nd :&quot; Our opponents have recently been endeavouring with enhanced zeal to produce discontent among the German people by spreading mischievous leaflets in the interior. These leaflets are mostly dropped over the country in paper or india-rubber toy balloons by means of a mechanical dropping apparatus, and they are further spread by enemy agents. Although, in view of the sound sense of the people, it is only to be expected . that they will of their own accord resist these enemy machinations, it is nevertheless emphatically pointed out that it is the patriotic duty of every German in whose hands such leaflets, paper balloons, or india-rubber balloons fall, to deliver them to the nearest police authorities, and to denounce to the police the agents who spread such leaflets.&quot;In the Weissenburger Zeilung of August 29th, 1918, the following notice was published :&quot; It is prohibited to retain pamphlets, books and leaflets, and pictures of the enemy propaganda.   For the delivery of unknown specimens, a bonus will be paid as follows:3 marks (3s.) for the 1st copy. 30 Pfg. (4d.) for other copies. 5 marks (5s.) for a book.&quot;In the Frankfurter Zeilung Herr F. Stossingcr characterised British prapaganda as &quot; The most complicated and dangerous of all.&quot; &quot; Countless are its activities,&quot; Herr Stossinger declared. The result of this and other articles in the same complimentary vein was the stirring-up in Germany of an agitation for counter-propaganda. &quot; In propaganda the enemy is undoubtedly our superior,&quot; admitted the Minister for War, General von Stein, in the Berlin Morgenpost on August 25th.To the same effect wrote the Rheinische-Westfalische-Zeilung :&quot; At any rate, the British Propaganda Department has worked hard. Had we shown the same activity in our Propaganda perhaps many a thing would have been different now. But in this, we regret to say, we were absolutely unprepared, but we hope that by now we have learned differently.&quot;and the Deutsche Tagezeitung :&quot; We Germans have a right to be proud of our General Staff. We have a feeling that our enemies&apos; General Staff cannot hold a candle to it, but we also have the feeling that our enemies have a brilliant Propaganda General Staff, whereas we have none.&apos;
)i     The creation of a Ministry of Propaganda was, therefore, urgently demanded, and some s jrganisation of the kind was established.   We had news of it in an army order captured towards he end of October :&quot; Generalkommando(z.b.V.) Nr. 54. K.-H.-Qu. d. 19. OH, 1918.&quot; KORPS-TAGESBEFEHL Nr. 109.&quot; 1. Den Divisionen und Korpstruppen gehen von heute ab im Umdruck Ausziige aus der deutschen, neutralen und feindl.

It was accused, rightly, of being responsible for the nervousness of the German ition, and for its waning confidence in its leaders. But the means by which it had caused ervousness and sapped confidence were not understood. The German leaders and newspapers eclared the agency at work to be lies. For example, in the Bavarian Lower House of Pailiament uring August the Bavarian Minister for War, General von Hellingrath, referred to rumours circulation, which, according to the Munich correspondent of the Cologne Gazette, were &quot; so ild and extravagant that one hardly understands how they can be credited and passed on ong certain classes of the people.&quot;&apos; These rumours,&quot; the Minister said, &quot; are nothing but the result of the industrious and termined agitation which our enemies carry on in the interior through their agents.&quot;The editor of the Berlin Lokal-Anzeiger, Herr von Kupffer, dealt in a leading article with the feet of these same rumours in the North of Germany. They had produced, he wrote, &quot; a mival of soul-storms, idiotic terror, and criminal irresponsibility,&quot; and he went on :&apos; The main thing is to remember the source of such rumours and to bear in mind what their object is.  Their object is to demoralise us and, by so doing, turn into
realities what otherwise would remain merely nightmares. One would have to be really blind not to see that these things radiate from that organisation in England formed to shatter the German nervous system by means of shameful and impudent lies. Is not the figure of Lord Northcliffe, the great Propaganda Chief of the English Home Army pilloried in world-history for all time ?&quot; Is anybody in doubt as to the purpose of this propaganda ? Does not everybody know that the generalissimo of this campaign of mendacity has unlimited funds at his disposal in order to circulate streams of lies through neutral channels with devilish cunning and almost impressive skill ? Does not everybody realise that the Northcliffe Propaganda is too shrewd to work by means of mere newspaper tales that could easily be disproved, and therefore resorts to the much more subtle method of carrying unrest, disloyalty and alarm into our country and into the lands of our allies by means of verbal communications of all sorts ? Paid rascals are systematically employed for this purpose. It is this sort of person who propagates these wild stories in Germany and upsets our sense of proportion in connection with war events. These are the facts. Let people bear them in mind before they promote the Northcliffe Propaganda by repeating every bit of washerwoman&apos;s gossip as gospel, even though it be without the slightest foundation in fact.&quot;The same rumours circulated in and around Hamburg, and on September 14th the widely-read shipping journal Hansa printed the following :&quot; God be thanked ! At last we are just beginning to recognise what the hour of war demands ; what is our duty as Germans and as citizens. Despondency, discontent, depression, hanging heads, grumbling ! We meet them at every step and turn, but we did not know their origin, these growths of evil fantasy. We did not understand what meant these secret whispers about alleged unfavourable news from the front, these exaggerated reports, fraught with misfortune, which passed so glibly from mouth to mouth. One had heard this, another that, but always it was something bad in regard to our military situation. Nothing definite was ever mentioned. There were only suggestions, which proved to be chimeras as soon as ever they could be run to earth. They were the birth of ignoble defeatism. Yet there they were, invisibly surrounding us, disturbing our spiritual balance, darkening our temper; like an epidemic, like poisonous bacilli, they flew hither and thither in all directions through our German air.&quot; Whence came they ? Who brought them to us ? To-day we know. To-day we can recognise the origin of this depression of German will-power. It was the long-advertised publicity offensive of the Entente directed against us under England&apos;s lead, and under the special direction of that unprincipled, unscrupulous rascal, Northcliffe.&quot;These diatribes were founded in misconception. The unrest in Germany, with the spreading of wild rumours to which unrest always gives birth, were caused indeed by British propaganda; this propaganda used as its ammunition, however, not lies, but solely the truth.   It was because they began to realise the truth that the German people felt nervous and depressed.   It was) because the failure of the U-boats and the coming of the Americans and the solidarity of the I Allies and the weakening of their own military power were now revealed to them, in spite of their I leaders&apos; efforts to keep them still in ignorance, it was because of their enlightenment on these I and other matters that the Germans were seized with panic, a panic which culminated towards! the end of October in complete collapse, and, during the first days of November, in revolution.IThe rumours were as rife among the troops as among the civil population.  There is ground,! indeed, for belief that the soldiers communicated to their relations and friends the uneasiness they felt upon learning how matters really stood.   An order issued by General Ludendorff said;&quot; There has been an increase in the number of complaints received from home that men on leave from the front create a very unfavourable impression by making
statements actually bordering on high treason and incitement to disobedience. Instances such as these drag through the mud the honour and respect of the individual as well as of the whole Army, and have a disastrous effect upon the moral of the people at home.&quot;Certainly the discipline and the confidence of the German Army declined steadily as the year wore on. In the Kolnische Volkszeitung for September 11th, a letter from the front said :&quot; Leaflets destined to cause low spirits and despair, or to send deserters to the enemy, are being showered down in thousands in certain places and their surroundings. It is this combat, waged openly or secretly, which, particularly at home, produces low spirits and despair. Here you find statements that Hindenburg was once regarded as a Divinity, but that his laurels are beginning to fade, which is quite evident from the way the enemy advance daily; that our troops have lost courage, whole companies are deserting to the enemy, and such like things.&quot;In another letter to the same newspaper-, published on August 20th, the writer said :&quot; Our enemies have recently been very busy distributing leaflets from the air. I have had two of these leaflets in my hands, and it is not to be doubted that our enemies are in that, also, our masters, for the pamphlets are so well produced that anyone who is not on the look-out is very likely to fall a victim to them.&quot;That such Propaganda might have had an effect if it had been tried earlier was evident from the admissions of war correspondents as well as generals. Herr W. Scheurrnann wrote in the Norddeutsche A llgemeine Zeilung (October 30th) :&quot; We Germans have learnt for the first time this autumn that the moral resistance of the fighter at the front is a power with which the Command must reckon, all the more cautiously inasmuch as it is difficult to estimate.&quot;One effect of telling the Germans the truth was to make them distrust their official com-muniques. &quot; We have in our dear Fatherland to-day,&quot; wrote the Kolnische Zeitung on September 11th, &quot; great numbers of innocent and ingenuous minds, who doubt the plain state-ments of the German Army reports, but believe the false reports and omissions of the enemy. To prove constantly the contrary to them is a rather thankless task, but of which one should never tire.&quot;It was, indeed, a thankless task to try to keep the truth from the whole German nation. &quot; Warn your brothers, your sons, your husbands, not to believe the enemy&apos;s leaflets,&quot; was one of &quot;Ten Commandments for German Women,&quot; published by the Kolnische Volkszeitung on October 20th, but it was then too late to maintain the lie-system by which the German resistance had been stimulated for so long.That the enemy leaders and newspapers made so loud an outcry against British truth-propaganda proved that it was effective. The first sign we had that our efforts were meeting with the success we hoped for was the manifesto of Marshal Hindenburg which appeared early in September. The text of this ingenuous confession that the truth was gaining ground read as follows :&quot; We are engaged in a hard struggle with our enemies. If numerical superiority alone guaranteed victory, Germany would long since have lain shattered on the ground. The enemy knows, however, that Germany and her Allies cannot be conquered by arms alone. The enemy knows that the spirit which dwells within our troops and our people makes us unconquerable. Therefore, together, with the struggle against German arms, he has undertaken a struggle against the German spirit; he seeks to poison our spirit and believes that German arms Will also become blunted if the German spirit is eaten away.&quot; We should not take this plan of the enemy lightly. The enemy conducts his campaign against our spirit by various means. He bombards our front, not only with a drumfire of artillery, but also with a drumfire of printed paper. Besides bombs which kill the body, his airmen throw down leaflets which are intended to kill the soul.
&quot; Of these enemy leaflets our field-grey men delivered up :In May     ..      ..&apos;      .......... 84,000In June    ...............        120,000In July     ..............        300,000&quot; A gigantic increase ! Ten thousand poisoned arrows daily in July ; 10,000 times daily the attempt to deprive the individual and the whole body of belief in the justice of our cause, and of the strength and confidence for ultimate victory ! We can reckon in addition that a great part of the enemy leaflets will not have been found by us.&quot;POISONING THE HOME SPIRIT.&quot; But the enemy is not merely satisfied in attacking the spirit of our Front, he wishes above all also to poison the spirit of our home. He knows what sources of strength for the Front rest in the home. True, his aeroplanes and balloons do not carry these leaflets far into our homeland ; they lie far from it in the lines in which the enemy vainly struggles for victory by arms. But the enemy hopes that many a field-grey soldier will send home the leaflet which has innocently fluttered down from the air. At home it will pass from hand to hand and be discussed at the beer-table, in families, in the sewing-room, in factories, and in the street. Unsuspectingly many thousands consume the poison For thousands the burden the war in any case imposes upon them is increased, and the will and hope for a victorious issue of the war is taken from them. All these again write their doubts to the Front, and Wilson, Lloyd George, and Clemenceau rub their hands.&quot;The enemy attacks the spirit of the home in another way besides. The silliest rumours, designed to break our inner power of resistance, are put into circulation, We find them simultaneously in Switzerland, in Holland, and in Denmark ; thence they spread like a wave over the whole of Germany. Or they emerge simultaneously, agreeing in silly details, in the remotest regions of our country in Silesia, in East Prussia, in the Rhineland and wend their way thence over the remainder of the home territory. This poison works on the men on leave and flows in letters to the Front. Again the enemy rubs his hands.&quot; The enemy is ingenious. He knows how to mix the little powder for everyone, He decoys the fighters at the Front. One leaflet runs :&quot; &apos; German soldiers !   It is a shameful lie that the French illtreat german prisoners. We are not brutes ; only come over to us without fear ; here you will find a most considerate reception, good food, and a peaceful refuge.&apos;&quot; Ask brave men who have succeeded with unspeakable difficulty in escaping from the enemy captivity about this. Plundered to the utmost in wire compounds, roofless, goaded by hunger and thirst into treasonable utterances, forced by blows and threats of death to betray their comrades, spat upon, pelted with filth by the French populace while being driven to hard labour, that is what the paradise that the enemy conjures up really looks like.&quot; Reproductions of original letters written by prisoners are also thrown down, in which these men describe how well it goes with them. God be praised, there are still also decent and humane commandants of prisoners&apos; camps in England and France, but these are the exception, and the letters the enemy throws down are only of three or four different kinds. But he sends these multiplied by many thousands of copies. The enemy intimidates the faint-hearted by saying :&quot; &apos; Your struggle is hopeless ; America will settle you ; your submarines areno good ; we are building more ships than they sink ; after the war we shall debaryou from getting raw materials ; then Germany&apos;s industry must starve. You will never see your colonies again.&apos;&quot; That is the tone of the leaflets ; now enticement, now threat.
&quot;GERMAN FACTS AND FANCIES.&quot; What is the real situation ? We have enforced peace in the East and are strong fenough to do it in the West, notwithstanding the Americans ; but we must be strong and united ; that is what the enemy is fighting against with this leaflets and rumours. He wishes to deprive us of faith and confidence, will and force.&quot; Why is the enemy continually seeking new allies in the struggle against us ? Why does he try to press nations still neutral into the struggle against us ? Because in strength we are his equals.&quot; Why does he incite black and other coloured men against German soldiers ? Because his will is to destroy us.&quot; Again, the enemy says another thing :&quot; &apos; You Germans, your form of government is wrong.   Fight against theHohenzollerns, against capitalism; help us, the Entente, to give you a betterform of State.&apos;&quot; The enemy knows perfectly what strength resides in our State and Empire ; but that is precisely why he combats it. The enemy also seeks to tear open old wounds in the German body politic. With his leaflets and by rumours he attempts to sow division and distrust among the Federal States. At Lake Constance we confiscated many thousands of leaflets conveyed to Bavaria and intended to excite anger against the North Germans. They wish to destroy the German Empire, which for centuries was the dream of Germans, and which our fathers won for us, and to condemn Germany to the impotence of the Thirty Years&apos; War.&quot; The enemy also wishes to shake our loyalty to our allies. He does not know the German way and the word of a German man. He himself sacrifices his allies ; he who is England&apos;s ally dies of it.&quot;TRAITORS TO THE FATHERLAND.&quot; And finally the enemy sends not the least dangerous of his poisoned arrows dipped in printers ink when he throws down the utterances of German men and German newspapers. The utterances of German newspapers are torn from their context. Regarding the utterances of Germans which are reproduced, remember that at every time there have been conscious and unconscious traitors to the Fatherland. Most of them reside abroad in neutral countries, in order not to be obliged to share our struggle and our privations, or to be condemned by our Judges as guilty of high treason. Nor have champions of extreme party tendencies any right to claim to speak for the generality of the German people.&quot; It is our strength, but also our weakness, that even in war we allow unrestricted utterance to every opinion. We still tolerate the reproduction in our newspapers of enemy Army reports and the speeches of enemy statesmen, which are weapons of attack directed against the spirit of the German Army and people. This is a sign of strength, because it proves a consciousness of might. But it is a weakness because it allows the enemy&apos;s poison to find an entrance among us.&quot; Therefore, German Army, German Homeland, if one of these thrown-out pieces of poison in the form of leaflet or rumour comes before your eyes or ears, remember that it originates with the enemy. Remember nothing comes from the enemy which is not harmful to Germany. Everyone must be mindful of this, whatever his position or party. If you meet anyone whose name and origin indeed are German, but who by nature stands in the enemy&apos;s camp, keep him at a distance, despise him, put him publicly in the pillory in order that every other true German may despise him.&quot; Defend yourself, German Army, German Homeland ! &quot;It may be added, as supplementing Marshal Hindenburg&apos;s figures, that in August the number of leaflets issued by the enemy propaganda Department was 3,958,116, in September 3,715,000,(335) E
and in October 5,360,000, while in the first ten clays of November, before the armistice put an 1 end to our activities, 1,400,000 were sent out.A few weeks later a similar appeal, signed by General von Hutier, of the Sixth German Army, I was captured. This ran :&quot; The enemy begins to realize that we cannot be crushed by blockade, superiority of numbers, or force of arms. He is, therefore, trying a last resource. While engaging to the utmost of his military force, he is racking his imagination for ruses, trickery, I . and other underhand methods, of which he is a past master, to induce in the minds ol German people a doubt of their invincibility. He has founded for this purpose a special Ministry (&apos; The Ministry for the Destruction of German Confidence &apos;), at the head ol which he has put the most thorough-going rascal of all the Entente Lord Northcliffc, He has been given billions for use in influencing opinion in the interior of the country \ and at the front by means of paid agents, the assassination of Ambassadors, and all the other ways in favour with the Entente.&quot; The method of Northcliffc at the front is to distribute through airmen a constantlj increasing number of leaflets and pamphlets; the letters of German prisoners are I falsified in the most outrageous way ; tracts and pamphlets are concocted, to which the names of German poets, writers, and statesmen are forged, or which present the! appearance of having been printed in Germany, and bear, for example, the title of the! Reclam series, when they really come from the Northcliffe Press, which is working day! and night for this same purpose. His thought and aim is that these forgeries, however! obvious they may appear to the man who thinks twice, may suggest a doubt, even! for a moment, in the minds of those who do not think for themselves, and that theiifl confidence in their leaders, in their own strength, and in the inexhaustible resources! of Germany may be shattered. j&quot; Fortunately, Northcliffe, the Minister for the Destruction of German Confidence, forgets that German soldiers are neither negroes nor Hindus, nor illiterate French, English or Americans, incapable of seeing through such machinations. Explain these infamous attempts to your young and inexperienced comrades, and tell them what our mortal enemy expects of them, and what is at stake. Pick up the leaflets and pamphlets and give them to our commanders for transmission to the High Command, which may be able to make valuable deductions from them as to the aims of our enemies. You will thus help the Command, and you will also help to hasten the hour of victory.&quot;Later the contention that British propaganda leaflets contained merely lies had to be dropped Experience proved it to be baseless. A &quot; high officer at the front,&quot; writing to the Kolnisch Zeitung (October 31st), said, in describing the demoralisation of the German Army, caused by retreat :&quot; What damaged us most of all was the paper war carried on by the enemy, who dropped daily among us 100,000 leaflets, which were extraordinarily well distributed and well edited.&quot;Until we received from the German generals the highly encouraging testimonials to the value of our work, were in doubt as to how far it was efficacious. With these tributes to reassure us, we went to work with far greater vigour and confidence. Every day almost, we received further assurance that our leaflets were being read, and that the truth was beginning to prevail. An officer on the French front wrote in August:&quot; The moral of the Boche is certainly deteriorating ; the prisoners we took are very different from the boisterous men we captured in 1916, and this is chiefly due to the poisonous literature which you give the Germans. Please do not let the efforts of the Ministry of Propaganda* be slackened. They have given an enormous amount of help to the fighting men in France.&quot;* Although Crewe House was in close touch with the Ministry of Information, it was a separate department.   The writer did not know this.
A Swiss Consular report to the British Foreign Office, dated September 5th, stated :&quot; Leaflets thrown by Allied airmen have much more effect now. Instead of being thrown away or laughed at, as was often the case in the past, they are eagerly picked up and read. There is no doubt that recent events have seriously shaken the moral of the German people and army. One of the returned officers mentioned above said that if the Entente knew what poison these leaflets, etc., were working in the minds of the German soldiers, they would give up lead and bombard with paper only in future.&quot;From a report made by the &quot;CP.&quot; department at British Field Headquarters :&quot; Nearly every prisoner passing through the left Corps Cage was in possession of sheets of British balloon propaganda. Prisoners stated much was picked up at Vaux, and none was sent to H.Q. It seems to have had great effect, especially the map showing our recent advance near Amiens.&quot; A Major-General of one of the attacking Corps informed me yesterday that the propaganda was having an excellent effect, especially as the moral of the enemy was now low.&quot;Among numberless other reports on the effect of balloon propaganda were the following :August 26th.   3rd Army I.Prisoners stated that balloon propaganda was believed to have considerable influence, especially as to the ineffectiveness of U-boats and Zeppelins.August 28th.   CP., G.H.Q.All prisoners agree to having heard of the balloon propaganda and to its wide circulation in spite of orders to the contrary.September 19th.   CP., G.H.Q.Army Order captured relating to penalties for the retention or the sending to Germany of leaflets. Statements by prisoners as to leaflets dealing with the arrival of Americans, Allied war aims and food conditions in Germany, all of which were believed by prisoners to have made a great impression.August 25th.   CP., G.H.Q.Balloon propaganda stated to be having very good effect on German moral. Some balloons reported to have travelled as far as 200 kil. (125 miles) into German territory.October 2nd.   1st Army I.Prisoners state leaflets much sought after and discussed, especial interest being aroused in extracts from German Socialist newspapers.October 10th.   Examining Officer.&quot; Prisoners of War at Catterick declare that our propaganda leaflets have caused a great impression. Soldiers now see that Germany started the war, and were the pioneers in gas attacks and the bombing of open towns. They express them-selves very bitterly against their rulers, and laugh over the U-boats which have not prevented the American army reaching France.&quot;October 13th.   CP., G.H.Q.Repatriated inhabitants from Turcoing and Roncq confirm great effect of leaflets on German troops, and demoralisation, which officers endeavour to counteract by lectures. Emphasis laid on number of deserters and low moral, which is largely attributed to leaflet propaganda.
During all this time, from May until October, leaflets were being distributed by the ballooi method only. As early as the month of May, application had been made to the War Office fo the use of airplanes. These had been employed for the purpose at an earlier date. M. I. 71). had prepared and translated into German a large quantity of propaganda material, and some i these early efforts were apparently too successful; they excited the anger of the Germa: Military Headquarters, with the result that captured airmen were tried by Court-Martial. after an unsatisfactory endeavour to distinguish between propaganda that would not be regarded jii &quot; inflammatory &quot; by the German Military Courts and matter for the distribution of which the; would punish captured airmen, the Army decided against the use of aeroplanes for distribute of literature. The stock in hand was transferred to the Ministry of Information and othei agencies which could secure its dissemination by civilian means. The late autumn of 1917 anc the winter of 1917-18 were occupied with efforts to secure other means of distribution. Witl: the assistance of the Aerial Inventions Board and Munitions Inventions Department mam devices were tried, and when any of these seemed likely to be useful, Captain Mitchell took it to France to discuss and try it with the Military authorities in the Field. At last, in February 1918, it became clear that&apos;paper balloons would give satisfactory results, and, as related on ai earlier page, distribution of leaflets by this agency began in March.Balloon propaganda required, however, to be supplemented by the employment of airplanes, which could travel greater distances and were necessary for distribution in the interior of Germany On May 8th, Lord Northcliffe suggested that the use of airplanes should be resumed.   Lord Milner replied :&quot; We are disputing the German contention that the distribution of literature from aeroplanes is contrary to the laws of war, and have, given notice that we intend tt institute reprisals immediately on receiving information that any of our airmen an undergoing punishment for similar action.&quot; Although we have, in deference to the wishes of the G.O.C -in-C , temporarilj suspended the distribution by aeroplane on the Western Front, we hold ourselves fret at any moment to resume it, and meanwhile literature continues to be distributed there by other and, as we-think, more effective means - There has been no suspension ol distribution by aeroplane on the Italian front.&quot;At a meeting of the Committee on June 11th, the question of the employment of airplanes was again raised, and it was decided to press the War Office further to give a decision in favour of scattering leaflets by this means in the interior of Germany for the enlightenment of the civil population. lord Northcliffe wrote on June 17th the following letter to the Minister for War , \&quot; My dear Lord Milner,&quot; I shall be very glad to know whether anything has yet been done to cancel the temporary suspension of the distribution of leaflets by aeroplane on the Western front, You will remember that in your letter of the 14th May, you said that we considered ourselves free to resume this method of distribution at any moment, and that we have not admitted the German contention that the practice is contrary to the laws of war..&quot; My Committee feel, and I entirely agree, that our propaganda work against Germany is severely handicapped by our disuse of this method of distribution, and if as I am informed, the Germans themselves continue to drop leaflets over our lines from aeroplanes, our attitude seems to me perfectly incomprehensible.&quot; We cannot believe that distribution by balloon can be anything like as accurate or, therefore, anything like a^ effective,&quot; Yours very sincerely,&quot; NORTHCLIFFE&quot;
On July 9th the Committee had communicated to them the reply of the War Cabinet:&quot; Dear Lord Northcliffe,&quot; I have made some personal enquiries regarding propaganda by aeroplane, and am given to understand that the General Staff are still holding up the use of aeroplanes for dropping pamphlets, because, as balloons are being used for the purpose with con-spicuous success, it has not been considered-right to subject our airmen to the risk of reprisals, with which they are still threatened on this work.   .   .   .&quot; Yours sincerely,&quot; M. P. A. HANKEY.&quot;A few weeks later the War Cabinet agreed that airplanes should be used, but to this agree-ment further objection was made by the Air Ministry. Only in October was this objection withdrawn. Then the preparation of leaflets for the interior of Germany was taken in hand. In one week five tons of leaflets were made ready (3,000,000 in number) and the distribution was started.Meanwhile the smuggling of pamphlets into Germany had been energetically pushed forward, also the insertion in neutral newspapers which were regularly read in German newspaper offices and frequently quoted, of articles telling the truth, calculated to affect German opinion. Articles were even sent through neutral sources to certain newspapers in Germany and Austria, and published by them.A special feature of this class of propaganda was a series of &quot; London Letters &quot; written in a pseudo-pro-German vein, but casting light upon the real situation in England, especially with regard to food. To take one small example, it was mentioned in one of these Letters that discontent had been caused by the conviction of persons who had given bread to dogs. &quot; &apos; Why should it not be given to dogs &apos; people ask,&apos; seeing that there is plenty of bread to spare? &apos; &quot;Useful work was also done in the preparation of interviews to be given out by prominent statesmen. These aroused much discussion in the German Press, and helped to widen the cleavage between the two parties in Germany, the mediaevalists and those who held that the Old System was dangerously out-of-date.During the last six weeks of the war, propaganda in Germany attained its highest degree of intensity. Every possible effort was made to draw attention to the real meaning of the changes taking place in Germany, to the necessity for the abdication of the Emperor, and for the punishment of all who had brought disaster upon Germany.The violence of the abuse with which Lord Northcliffe was assailed proved that his work was doing what it aimed at, and to the venomous attacks may be added this bitter admission of the Kolnische Volkszeihmg: &quot; Unfortunately we cannot deny that Lord Northcliffe attained all his aims, and he can leave the political arena in triumph.&quot;
BULGARIA.The activities of the Committee for Propaganda in Enemy Countries, so far as they were brought to bear upon Bulgaria, were summarised in the following report of the Bulgaria sub-committee, submitted shortly after that country went out of the war :&quot; The work of Enemy Propaganda in Bulgaria is brought to a happy close by that country&apos;s unconditional surrender to the Allied armies ; and we may quite fairly claim that events have justified the attitude adopted by this committee.&quot;It will be remembered that on July 29th a document containing an outline of Balkan policy with special reference to propaganda in Bulgaria which was the joint work of Mr. Steed, Captain Heard, Mr. Alan Leeper and Dr. Seton-Watson was submitted to the Foreign Office for Mr. Balfour&apos;s approval. This document emphasized the need for an Allied decision in favour of Southern Slav, Roumanian and Greek unity, as a preliminary to any arrangement with Bulgaria, and the need for consulting the Serbian and Greek Governments before negotiating with Bulgaria. It suggested as preliminary conditions to the establishment of friendly relations with Bulgaria.&quot; (a)   The expulsion of King Ferdinand and his family ;&quot; (b)   A complete rupture with Germany ;&quot; (c)   Establishment of a democratic government;&quot; (d)   The orientation of Bulgarian policy in the direction of a Balkan Confeder-ation under the ;egis of the Allied Powers and of the United States.&quot; These lines were suggested as the suitable basis for a reply to secret overtures which had been made to certain informal British representatives in Switzerland by Bulgarian emissaries claiming to speak for the new Premier, Mr. Malinof.&quot; In due course, the Committee received a reply from the Foreign Office, and was authorised to convey through our agent in question an informal message to the effect &apos; that until Bulgaria had given proof that a complete reversal of her policy had actually been brought about, we are not prepared to entertain any suggestions from her.&apos; He was also instructed to convey as his personal conviction, that the idea of placing a British prince on the Bulgarian throne, which had been mooted by certain of these Bulgarian emissaries, is regarded by London as &apos; entirely unattractive.&apos; The Bulgarian agents were duly notified in this sense, and it is to be presumed that so firm a message was not without its effect upon the Malinof government.&quot; It may be of interest to add that one of the practical means by which the Bulgarian emissaries endeavoured to raise our hopes, was the suggestion that certain army chiefs might take part in a movement for the reversal of the German regime, and that the chief name mentioned in this connection was that of General Lukov, who has actually been one of the three plenipotentiaries who signed the surrender at Salonica.&quot; Shortly after giving us the instructions referred to above, the&apos; Foreign Office authorised two members of our Committee, Mr. Steed and Dr. Seton-Watson, to convey quite informally to the Greek and Serbian representatives in London, the attitude of London towards these overtures in Switzerland. This was considered all the more necessary in view of the fact that numerous rumours had already reached the Serbs and Greeks, such as were calculated to sow distrust and alarm. This step undoubtedly had a reassuring effect.&quot; This brief summary presents the most important activities of the committee. All its other projects such as the preparation or suggestion of leaflets, and the proposal for founding and supporting a revolutionary Bulgarian newspaper now fall into the background and need not be discussed in any detail.  The proposed newspaper is now,
159of course, unnecessary, and the journalist who had already been provisionally selected to edit it, will now be allowed to remain in Switzerland. Meanwhile Mr. Talbot, who had been sent over to Paris to make the necessary preliminary arrangements there, is being recalled to London. The committee is already aware that a certain Bulgarian agent whom, acting on competent advice, we had invited to London for examination, was rejected as entirely untrustworthy and sent back to France.&quot; In conclusion, attention may be drawn to the very high competence and discretion of the agent whom we employed in Switzerland as a link with the various Bulgarian emissaries. The information with which he supplied us was of the very highest value to our decisions.&quot;TURKEY.It should be mentioned that propaganda in Turkey and among the Turkish troops was, by arrangement, left to a branch of the Ministry of Information.PROPAGANDA AMONG PRISONERS OF WAR.At the first meeting of the Crewe House Committee, on May 14th, Sir Charles Nicholson accepted the invitation of Lord Northcliffe to take charge of work among German prisoners. After seeing Lord Milner, Minister for War, and the Adjutant-General, Sir Charles set to work to establish relations with the Commandants of Prisoner of War camps in Great Britain. At the same time he got together a sub-committee to assist him, consisting of:Lieut.-Colonel Larking (representing the War Office) Major, the Earl of Kerry, D.S.O., M.P. Mr. G. F. Shee Colonel G. CrosfieldMr. V. Gerhardi (Secretary).The distribution of books, pamphlets and newspapers to the camps was then taken in hand. Such works as Prince Lichnowsky&apos;s Memorandum on the causes of the War, and &quot; Gerade weil ich Deutscher bin &quot; were found effective, and journals such as the Arbeiter Zeitung of Vienna helped to set before German prisoners the real state of affairs in their country and in Austria.At the suggestion of the German Department, a Calendar of the War was prepared, containing articles likely to influence German minds in the direction of constitutional government, a League of Nations, and national greatness based upon industrial, scientific and artistic achievement instead of upon Blood and Iron. This was prepared by the German Department and had not been completed when, to the grief of all who had been associated with him, Sir Charles Nicholson died. His loss was sincerely regretted by his colleagues at Crewe House. Although his work there had come to an end, they hoped for many years to enjoy his stimulating and cheery companionship, and to benefit by his ripe judgment in public affairs,
INTER ALLY CONFERENCE.In the course of the summer it became evident that there was urgent need of some eo: ordination of effort between the Propaganda Departments of the Allied and Associated Powers, Up to this time they had worked without more than occasional casual communication and without any exchange of views. Now Lord Northcliffe, with the assent of the War Cabinet issued invita-tions to an Inter-Ally Conference on Propaganda in Enemy Countries, and on August 14th, the members of the Conference assembled at Crewe House.

The whole of August 15th was spent by the Committee in discussion which produced many aluable suggestions. The upshot of their deliberations was put before the Conference in ugust 16th in the shape of the following reports :REPORT OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE. &quot; The Committee on Policy has held three sittings, and is happy to report that, though its labours have been long, they have been so harmonious that the statement of its conclusions can be comparatively brief. The Chairman made it clear at the outset that, while he and his colleagues would do everything in their power to recommend to their Governments whatever resolutions the Committee might adopt, their acceptance of those resolutions would necessarily be ad referendum and not immediately binding upon their Governments. In the discussion which followed, it was recognised that this position was identical&quot; with that of the other members of the Committee, and that it was in fact analogous to the position which Lord Northcliffe had always taken up in regard to the British Government. - It was also recognised that, while effective propa-ganda in enemy countries presupposes a clear policy in regard to each of the countries concerned, it would be futile and dangerous for propagandists to lay down and to proclaim their own policy without reference to the diplomatic, military, and naval authorities through whose efforts alone policy can be made operative. Any other procedure would involve the risk of confusion, contradiction, and consequent in-efficiency.&quot; The recognition of this fundamental principle does not in the least impair the value of propagandists as pioneers in the work of suggesting to their respective Governments lines of policy which might fruitfully be adopted. On the contrary, it may relieve responsible statesmen of much work of detail, and permit of a more rapid formulation of tentative solutions of political problems than might otherwise be practic-able. It had always been Lord NorthclihVs intention that when any line of policy laid by him before the Government had been sanctioned as a basis for Propaganda, the British Government should ask Allied Governments to assent to it, so that there might be definite co-ordination of Allied Propaganda policy, if not indeed absolute unanimity. For various reasons, the work of co-ordination by this method had proceeded very slowly, and it had become evident that more rapid co-ordination might be attained through the instrumentality of such Inter-Allied gatherings as the present. Inter-Allied Propaganda Conferences are, in fact, an extension to the work of co-ordination of the same method which has been found valuable in the preparation of British Propaganda policy. Such conferences prepare the ground for the action of Allied Governments, and submit to them in a tangible form resolutions and recommendations which can be sanctioned, modified, or rejected.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. In regard to the Propaganda against Austria-Hungary the Committee found itself in complete agreement with the scheme of policy sanctioned by the British Government for purposes of Propaganda, and amplified by the decisions of the British, French and Italian Governments at the time of, or in connection with, the Rome Congress of Oppressed Austro-Hungarian Nationalities. It recognised that such extensions of policy, while springing from considerations of Allied principles, had, in part, corres-ponded to the real demands of the Propaganda situation, which, in their turn, had sprung from the exigencies of the military situation and, in particular, from the necessity of utilising the established principles of the alliance for the purpose of impeding or hampering the Austro-Hungarian offensive against Italy. Subsequent acts and declara-tions on the part of Allied Governments and of the Governments of the United States, made it clear that the joint policy of the Allies was tending increasingly towards the constructive liberation of the subject Austro-Hungarian races. The main task of the Committee in relation to propaganda in Austria-Hungary seemed, therefore, to be one of unifying for Propaganda purposes these various acts and declarations, and of
preparing, if possible, the way for a joint Allied declaration that might complete an render more effective the work of Allied Propaganda both in the interior of Austria Hungary and among Austro-Hungarian troops at the front.The discussion upon the expediency and the possibility of such a joint Allia declaration was exhaustive and illuminating. In view of the position already takei up by the Allied Governments and by the United States in regard to the Czecho-Slovak the Poles, and the Rumanians, it appeared that the main issue awaiting definition concerned the question of Jugo-Slav unity and independence, and of the attitud of Italy towards them. The chief Italian delegate, Professor Borgese, made, in thi respect, an eloquent and convincing contribution to the knowledge of the Committee He dealt at length with the Jugo-Slav question in its Italian aspects, and emphasize! the desirability, from the point of view of Italo-Jugo-Slav agreement, that the Jugo-Sb Committee in Allied countries should do its utmost to prevent the Jugo-Slav pros outside Austria, and as far as possible within Austria, from raising controvcrsia questions of territory and of the delimitation of frontiers, which arc bound to read unfavourably upon Italian public opinion. His arguments, in this respect, form the subject of a special recommendation which the Committee has adopted for eventual communication to the Jugo-Slav Committee.  It runs :&quot; With reference to the best means of aiding Allied Propaganda in favour ol the freedom of the Austro-Hungarian subject races, the Committee expresses] strong hope that all controversial discussions of the frontiers between Italy and the future Jugo-Slav State will be avoided by the Jugo-Slav press and. the Jugo-Slav leaders both outside, and as far as the Jugo-Slav leaders may be able to exed their influence also inside, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, just as they have been avoided of late by the most important organs of the Italian press and in the public speeches of influential Italian leaders.&quot;Professor Borgese also submitted, and the Committee unanimously adopted, the following resolution: &quot; In order to secure stronger and better co-ordinated Propaganda among Austro-Hungarian nationalitites, the present Conference expresses its desire thai at the next Inter-Allied Conference on Propaganda in Enemy Countries, repre-sentatives of the National Councils of the oppressed nationalities should be admitted to the technical committees of the Conference.&quot;During the debate upon this recommendation and this resolution, it became clearly apparent that the Committee regards, and is confident that the Conference will regard, the Italian national claims to the union with Italy of the cities and regions of Trent, Trieste, and the other regions of Italian character as not only entirely justified, but as an elementary dictate of the Allies&apos; respect for the principles of nationality and of ethnical justice. Precisely because the Committee supports the principles formulated in the Italo-Jugo-Slav Agreement of last March and sees in them the basis of fruitful co-ordination between Italy, Jugo-Slavia and the other nationalities now oppressed of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, it holds the Italian national rights above mentioned to be imprescriptible and not open to discussion.The Committee also felt that both for reason of propaganda and from the point o&apos; view of the future independence and moral and political security of the Italian nation a foremost part in the work of creating a free and united Jugo-Slav State naturally falls to Italy. It has, therefore, after the most careful consideration, unanimously adopted and it recommends to the Conference the following resolution :&quot; Considering the adhesion of the Italian Government, by the Prime Ministers speech of April, 1918, to the resolutions of the Rome Congress of Austro-Hungariai subject races (which embodied the agreement between&apos;the Jugo-Slavs and the Italian Committee) and by his recent telegram to the Prime Minister of Serbia. M. Pashitch;
&quot; Considering the exemplifications of Allied Policy towards Austria-Hungary in the French and Italian Conventions with the Czecho-Slovak National Council, the British declaration recognising the Czecho-Slovaks as an Allied Nation, the Allied declaration at the Versailles Conference of June 3rd, 1918, in favour of the unity and independence of Poland and Mr. Lansing&apos;s statement of the 28th June, that all branches of the Slav races should be completely freed from German and Austrian rule;&quot; Considering further the extreme expediency, especially in view of possible military developments on the Italian front, that the Allied policy of liberating the oppressed Hapsburg peoples should be represented, in the first place, by Italy on whose front Allied propaganda against Austria-Hungary is principally located ;&quot; The Policy Committee of the Inter-Allied Propaganda Conference resolves to suggest that the Italian Government take the initiative in promoting a joint and unanimous public declaration that all the Allies regard the establishment of a free and united Jugo-Slav State, embracing Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, as one of the conditions of a just and lasting peace, and of the rule of right in Europe.&quot;BULGARIA.The Committee recognised the essential connection between Allied propaganda policy towards Austria-Hungary and Allied propaganda policy in the Balkans. Without the adoption by the Allied Governments of a definite policy in regard to Jugo-Slav and Rumanian unity and independence, it is impossible to formulate any effective propaganda policy in regard to Bulgaria. Upon the merits of propaganda in Bulgaria, the Committee unanimously adheres to the principles laid down in Lord NorthclifiVs opening statement, that is to say, that an essential preliminary to any conversations or negotiations with Bulgaria must be a complete and effective reversal of the policy hitherto pursued by Bulgaria as the enemy of the Allies ; and until this reversal has taken place, the objects of the Allied propaganda should be to bring home to the Bulgarian people a sense of the dangers that threaten them unless they can convince the Allies by their conduct of their sincere repentance. The Committee is also of the opinion that pending this necessary change, our Serbian and Greek Allies should not be left in ignorance of the propaganda policy which the chief Allied Powers may adopt.POLAND.With reference to Poland, the Chairman made a brief but pregnant statement, declaring the policy of propaganda in regard to the Poles to be identical with that laid down by President Wilson and President Poincare and formulated by the Allied Prime Ministers on June 3rd in the words : .&quot; The creation of a united and independent Polish State, with free access to the sea constitutes one of the conditions of a solid and just peace and of the rule of right in Europe.&quot; He added that the growth of Prussian power for evil, and the present position of Prussia in the world, had their origin in the partition of Poland. Consequently he urged that the reunion of the various parts of Poland would be not only the reparation of an historical injustice, but would constitute a strong guarantee against any revival of the Prussian system. He claimed that the greater the strength of Poland, the firmer would be the security of Europe and the world against any renewal of aggressive Prussian militarism.In the discussion which followed, general agreement was expressed with this view ; but it was pointed out that a reunited Poland might be stronger in proportion as its territory was ethnographically compact and did not include other neighbouring racial elements with whom Poland would have every interest to live in concord, but which, were they included against their will within her frontiers, might become sources of disturbance and weakness. It was also considered desirable that the Polish National Committee, in order to become not less valuable to the Allies as an adjunct and agency of propaganda in enemy countries than are the Czech and Jugo-Slav Committees, might extend the basis of its representation, so as to secure more unanimous support
from the various sections of Polish opinion.   The Committee adopted, and submits t the approval of the Conference, the following resolution and recommendation. 1 would propose to communicate the recommendation to the Polish National Committee &quot; The Conference records its conviction that the creation of a united and in dependent Polish State, with free access to the sea, is an essential requirement o lasting peace in Europe, and expresses the belief that the more closely the frontier, of this future Polish State follow ethnographical lines, the stronger will it be ti play its part in safeguarding that peace, and the more harmonious will be it relations with neighbouring peoples which, like the Poles arc striving to secure i free existence.&quot; The Conference, anxious that Allied propaganda may truly express till desires of the Polish people as a whole, and may tend to promote its welfare expresses the hope that the Polish National Council may extend the basis of it representation so as to be in a position to lend still further aid to Allied Propaganda in enemy countries.&quot;ALSACE-LORRAINE.Passing to the consideration of the question of Alsace-Lorraine, the Committee found itself in entire agreement with its Chairman&apos;s declaration that the return of the two provinces to France is an imperative demand of international justice, and not a concession to be made to the Allies to French national feeling. The undoing of the flagrant wrong done by Germany in 1871 is so clearly a condition of any just peace, that it requires no further demonstration ; quite apart from the historical justification ol the French claim to the reincorporation of these provinces in France by their dis-annexation from Germany, the title of the people of Alsace-Lorraine to determine their own allegiance proceeds from their voluntary adhesion to France in 1790, no less than from the protests of their elected representatives against the Treaty of Frankfurt in the French National Assembly at Bordeaux in 1871, and in the German Reichstag in 1874. In regard to Alsace-Lorraine, the Committee is convinced that Allied Propaganda in Germany should make known to the German people the determination of the Allies to insist in all circumstances upon this vindication of rights.Consequently it adopts the following resolutions :1. Propaganda on the subject of Alsace-Lorraine should be unified and conducted on general lines indicated by France. 2. The argument to which first place should always be given is that of outragedright and of the will of the inhabitants as expressed in their solemn and repeated protests.3. The question of Alsace-Lorraine is a question of international right, the solution of which interests the whole world.GERMANY.As to propaganda addressed to the German people themselves in regard to the future position of Germany the Committee is in full agreement with the policy rccom-mended by Lord Northcliffe with the approval of the British Government and sum-marised in his opening statements. It believes that Allied propaganda should make it clear that the chief object of the Allies is the changing of Germany, not the destruction of the German people ; and that the German people can hope for an adequate position in the world, and for admission into a future society of nations when they have qualified themselves for partnership with civilised communities by making the necessary reparations and restorations (primarily in the case of Belgium) by overthrowing the system known as Prussian militarism, and when they have effectively abandoned all designs of mastery over Europe. At the same time, the Committee lay stress upon the importance of bringing home to the German people a sense of the economic pressure which the Allies, and above all the United States of America, are in a position to exercise, and will exercise, until the conditions of a just peace are accepted.
To this end the Committee strongly urges that, in the various Allied countries and in the United States, a comprehensive scheme of world organisation be studied and worked out, and that, in particular, the steps already taken to co-ordinate the economic policy of the Allies and of the United States be publicly explained and brought to the knowledge of the Germans. The Committee has, therefore, adopted and recommends to the Conference the following resolution :&quot; In consideration of the fact that the Allied Governments have in their own respective fields of action, and by their joint action begun to give effect to economic co-operation, which is to-day a powerful instrument of war, and which may, after the war, serve as a basis for the systematic organisation of the resources of the world :&quot; The Conference expresses its satisfaction witli the results already attained and believes that it would be expedient to make plain to enemy public opinion, by means of a service of information, which would set forth both the principles of Allied economic action and their results as worked out in daily practice, the gravity of the danger by which the enemy is threatened, and the advantages assured to those who are admitted to co-operation with the Allies.&quot;The Committee adopted the following resolution :&quot; That in view of the great importance of co-ordinating the Allies&apos; policies and organisations for the conduct of propaganda in enemy countries, a permanent body be constituted for this purpose ;&quot; That this body consist of four members, representing respectively the four propaganda departments which have taken part in this Conference ; each member having the power to nominate an assistant or a substitute, or both, if necessary ;&quot; That the provisional headquarters of the body shall be at Crewe House, London, until permanent headquarters be determined ;&quot; That the establishment expenses be shared equally between the four Governments ; and that a permanent secretariat be appointed thereto.&quot;In adhering to this resolution, and in deciding that it be recommended for adoption by the Allied Governments and by the United States, the Policy Committee has been influenced especially by the hope that the proposed arrangement may expedite the co-ordination of Allied propaganda policy, facilitate the preparation of concordant declarations by the Allied Governments at suitable moments, and assist in the proper organisation of congresses, such as the second congress of the oppressed Austro-Hungarian nationalities, which it is intended to hold in Paris.In regard to the date of this congress, the Policy Committee is of opinion that it should be held at the beginning of October, in order to allow time for the congress to be given a solemn and representative character.Signed by :France: A.

REPORT OF DISTRIBUTION COMMITTEE. (a) MILITARY.The Committee examined and considered the various methods in use or suggested for the distribution of propaganda over enemy lines.It was found that the Italians employed aeroplanes, projectiles, and contai patrols; the French aeroplanes, projectiles and balloons; the British only ballon on the Western Front, but aeroplanes in the East; and that sea-planes might I employed to reach special objectives in the Mediterranean.Each country gave favourable reports on the methods they employed, but a. were agreed that a constant exchange of information as to results was required.In certain cases, such as,the mountainous Italian Front, where very limited target had to be reached, the dropping of propaganda in bulk was necessary ; but in mo; cases methods that secured a wide scattering of the leaflets, so that those might! secured and hidden by individuals, was necessary. The French explained a devio now in its experimental stage, to secure an automatic scattering from aeroplane The &quot; releases &quot; of English balloons were agreed to produce a most adequate scatterinj Various devices employed in projectiles were successful in the case,of leaflets writ the angle of projection was high and the wind was favourable, but hitherto had n; been successful with pamphlets.It was recognised that aeroplanes were, at present, the best means of reachir. distant targets with accuracythat for shorter distances, from a few hundred yarel.1 up to ten miles, projectiles would secure great accuracy. iWith regard to range, it was recognised that aefoplanes had the widest limit j and the scattering of literature in Berlin by the French, and in Vienna by the Italianl were considered accomplishments of great brilliancy and promise of usefulness, ar;f-that the.present types of paper balloons were thoroughly effective for ranges up tl twenty or thirty miles, though with less certainty of aim up to 100 or 150 miles ; buf that with larger balloons (such as the fabric balloons at present in the possession of tin English, or the new larger doped paper balloons now being prepared in England, or till] reinforced paper balloons being experimented with in France) the distances could bij increased to several hundred miles.With regard to the bulk that could be distributed it was stated that each of this present standard balloons, as used by the English and French, carried 41bs. 2ozs. olf literature, and that projectiles could take from a few ounces up to 8 or 91bs. ThtB large fabric balloons, now available at G.H.Q., could carry up to 151bs.The French by their various methods, had distributed 25 million leaflets sinctH last December, the British on the Western Front over 8 millions in the last four months!: and the Italians very large numbers of which exact particulars were not available, the capability being up to a million a day, and depending on political circumstance&amp;BIt was recognised that there were no objections to the use of balloons, as the! operations did not interfere with other work and did not excite retaliation from theB enemy. The use of projectiles was apt to provoke retaliation unless it were carried! out at night or to a limited extent.There was difference of experience and opinion with regard to the use of aeroplanes! The Italians and French stated that no action had been taken by the enemy in the! case of their aviators who had been captured, and that they found no difficulty ml imposing this duty on their airman.The British stated that the German had taken strong measures, and had threatened! their continuance against aviators captured after distributing leaflets. The re-j presentative of the British Air Ministry stated that, after giving full consideration!
to the matter, and notwithstanding their appreciation of the value of propaganda, they were opposed to the use of aeroplanes for this purpose, partly on the ground of the bad psychological effect of such work on young pilots and aviators and partly because the supply of trained men and of machines was no more than sufficient for the direct purposes of this arm of the Forces.The representative of G.H.Q., France, stated that the British Army had accepted this view. He added that balloons could be employed on the Western Front three days a week on the average, and that there was no mechanical reason why the method by balloons could not be increased to meet every reasonable requirement.A French representative in the course of a discussion as to the utility of throwing some leaflets in bombing expeditions, reported the opinion of a well-known pro-ally German citizen that in the case of the Rhine towns and rich cities of Germany, the propaganda of fear, that is to say, the actual dropping of bombs, was more useful  especially at present than the dropping of literature.It was agreed that the suggested use of aeroplanes to scatter leaflets at great heights parallel with the enemy lines encountered most of the objections to, and none of the dangers of their direct use by crossing the lines.A device, which has been working out experimentally in England, but not employed because of the danger it might occasion to aeroplanes, was explained and the apparatus was shown. It consisted in sending up leaflets to be liberated at the necessaty height for wind driftage by means of a messenger travelling up and down the cable of a box kite. This means was recognised to be cheap and efficient for employment where it would not be dangerous to aeroplanes.The Committee agreed that the regular exchange of information as to methods employed by the Allies, and as to the results actually obtained by these, would be of great value, and recommended that a permanent bureau should be established to collect and exchange such information and reports.Signed:G.

TALBOT (Secretary).(b) CIVIL.The Committee considered:(a) The means by which the enemy public can be informed, and its opinion influenced by action in and through Neutral Countries, and(b) The Countries available as bases of operations.The Committee agreed to present the following recommendations to the Conference. (Except where otherwise expressly noted, these recommendations were unanimous): (1) In the opinion of the Committee, the Neutral Press, and especially the German-Swiss Press, is one of the most effective vehicles for conveying facts and ideas to
the Enemy Public. The Committee recommends that increased attention 1 paid to the insertion of news and articles in Neutral organs which are either rea or quoted in the Enemy Countries. Special stress is laid on the importance!; establishing effective relations with organs which have a reputation for stric neutrality or pro-Enemy bias.(2) The Committee attaches special importance to Personal Propaganda amon eminent Neutrals, whether in the Military, Political Journalistic, Literal] Financial, or Business World, whose views are likely to react on Enemy opinioi The Committee feels that this most valuable field of activity is one which cat 1 in a special degree for Inter-Allied co-operation. In each country a survey shout: be made of the personalities whom it is worth while to take into account, and sue; individuals should then be allotted to the agents of the respective Powers, accordin; to the suitability of the persons concerned, and the means of contact available In this way we should provide ourselves with the means of securing that all sue: - personalities come within the orbit of salutary personal intercourse. The Diplomatic Missions of the Allied Powers should be encouraged to devote themselves more systematically to this work, in which their eminent position enables then to take a most useful share. Experience, moreover, having shown that p suitable cases very satisfactory results have been obtained by getting Neutrals-including men of pro-Enemy tendencies to visit Allied Countries, the Committee considers that subject to the observance of &quot;the usual precautions and propel discrimination, such visits are as useful in the interests of Enemy, as of Neutral Propaganda.(3) The Committee recommends intensive propaganda among enemy subjects, permanently or temporarily resident in Neutral Countries, and draws particulai attention to the desirability of utilising the services of enemy subjects already imbued with either pro-Allied Convictions or with revolutionary tendencies.(4) The Committee recommends that each Power should seek through its agencies to establish channels through which enemy newspaper correspondents can be influenced or provided with information. The task of approaching all sufficiently-important correspondents, with whom contact has not yet been established should be apportioned among the agencies of the Powers according to the opportunities of approach available. Channels created under a scheme of this kind should be made mutually available to the respective Allied agents in the localities concerned(5.) Having regard to the extent to which the ordinary Book Trade channels into Germany are still operating, the Committee recommends the publication in Neutral Countries of works which, though not directly bearing on the issues of the War, are expressly calculated to educate Enemy opinion in a democratic sense.(6) The Committee holds that, in view of its great utility, clandestine circulation in the Enemy countries of carefully-chosen literature, especially if actually written by Enemy subjects of pro-Allied or Revolutionary tendencies, should be secured through every available channel. In view of the precarious and delicate nature of this work, the Committee desires specially to emphasize the necessity of seeking out and developing new channels for distribution of this kind.&apos;(7) The Committee further considered other forms of activity, including the organisa-tion and support of Revolutionary bodies of Enemy subjects, Contact Work on the Enemy Frontiers, the feeding of the Enemy Intelligence Collecting Centres, and the utilisation of agents in Enemy Countries, and endorsed the employment of those methods as circumstances permit or require.(8) The Committee recommends that the Associated Powers should energetically promote the establishment of new agencies and the strengthening of existing agencies, in Switzerland, Holland and Scandinavia.
Further, the Committee recommends that the local executives of the agencies of the four Powers represented at the Conference should be instructed to maintain the closest mutual relations with a view to securing the maximum exploitation, for the benefit of all, of the information, opportunities, or special skill available to each agency.Subject to the dissenting opinion of two French and one English member, who consider that the existing protection suffices, the Committee recommends, that, so far as practicable, the leading members of Enemy Propagandist agencies in Neutral Countries should be safeguarded by additional diplomatic support.(9) The Committee recommends that the possibilities of Russia as a base of operations for Enemy Propaganda should be investigated without delay.Signed :G.

GUEST.NOTE : The American Representative (Captain Heber Blankenhorn) refrained from voting, on the ground that he attended in the capacity of observer only.REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON PROPAGANDA MATERIAL.- The main part of the time (five hours) which the Committee gave to the discussion of its subject was devoted to the questions of the most effective forms of propaganda and to the special methods desirable for putting these forms into practice. There was general agreement that the best way to depress the morale of the German Troops and the German population was to show them that it was against their interest to continue the war ; that the longer they went on the worse they would fare both during the war and after ; and that their only hope of regaining their place in the community of nations la3&apos; in throwing over the bad advisers who had led them into the war, and whose repeated promises of success had been one after the other falsified. Up to now the Germans have always had a hope before them. They were taught to hope for great advantage from the downfall of Russia, from the unrestricted U-boat warfare, from the offensive on the Western Front which began last March. Now, for the first time, their leaders do not know what hope to dangle before them. Therefore, the moment is one peculiarly favourable for propaganda if it is undertaken upon the right lines.It appeared to the Committee that the best lines upon which to work at present would be to emphasize as much as possible the great American effort, both in the field and at home in the factory, the shipyard, and the farm. At the same time the dark commercial outlook for Germans, the dangers lying latent for them in the control of raw materials by the Allies, the discovery of so many of their trade secrets, and the
sobuilding up in France, Italy and England, and the United States, of industries in which they had almost a monopoly before the war, ought also to be brought as vividly as possible before them. They should be told the truth about the food situation in France and England, which so far has been kept from them. They should be given news an quickly as possible of Allied successes. They should be depressed as much as possible yet at the same time care should be taken not to let them think they are for ever excluded from relations or business and friendship with the peoples now fighting against them. If they are made to believe this, their backs would be stiffened to fight on desperately as long as possible. A sound line of Propaganda, the Committee considered, is to leave open a doorway through which if they get rid of Pan-Germanism and renounce its theories of world domination by blood and iron they will in time be admitted again to the same intercourse as before. It was agreed that for soldiers the most elementary propaganda was the best. More elaborate arguments and demonstrations should be kept for pamphlets to be smuggled into Germany and for articles in neutral papers, Use should be made wherever possible of diagrams appealing instantly to the eye.A long discussion took place on the question of revolutionary propaganda. The opinion was expressed that it was better to denounce the Pan-German party generally and throw upon them the responsibility for the war and for all the misfortunes which Germany has suffered and will suffer from it, rather than to attack the Emperor. On the other hand it was pointed out that attacks on an individual arc always more effective than attacks on a party. Finally it was agreed that anything said against the Hohenzollern dynasty should be taken, either in reality or in appearance from German sources so as to avoid the risk that attacks clearly emanating from Allied sources might strengthen rather than weaken the Emperor&apos;s hold upon the people of Germany. While a good deal of material is available from German Anti-Imperial sources, it was suggested] that the advantage of circulating, for example, speeches of Socialists, might be counter-balanced by.the disadvantage that it would make such speakers less inclined to talk, Some Socialists have appealed to the French Government not to use their speeches for Propaganda, because this weakened their efforts. It was agreed that incitements to German soldiers to desert were legitimate and might be useful. The sending into Germany of photographs of prisoners of war taken immediately after their capture, when they are usually in a deplorable condition and after two months of captivity when their physical condition is good, was recommended. As it appeared that there were in the German Army many soldiers anxious to try their luck in a new country instead of going back to Germany, it was also proposed that the inducement oi facilities for emigration to the American and other continents might be held out to the men who come over within a certain time.With regard to Austria-Hungary, the Committee discussed whether it was illegitimate to exploit the land hunger among the Magyar peasants and the discontent among the German proletariats. It was agreed that it would do no harm to support the agrarian agitators in Hungary, but, as regards Bolshevik Propaganda among the Austro-German working classes, that we ought only to circulate their own literature. Dr. Seton-Watson suggested that the United States, in mobilising its Slav elements might spare members of each of the Slav nationalitites for propaganda work in England and in France ; and Mr. Keeley undertook to see whether this could be done.Propaganda in Bulgaria depends on the policy which the Entente Powers and the United States decide to follow with regard to that country. Until such a policy is settled, little can be done in a large way. It is useful, however, to make the Bulgarians acquainted with a number of facts of which they are ignorant, for example, the failure of U-boats to reduce England to the verge of starvation, a large number of American troops already in France, and so on. Leaflets on these and other topics are being dropped regularly by aeroplanes on the Salonika front in considerable quantities. A good deal, it was suggested, can be done through Bulgars in Switzerland. But so long
as the Bulgarians believe that the United States is their friend and will see them through whatever happens, little impression can be made upon them.With regard to co-operation between the various bodies engaged in Propaganda, it was proposed by General Le Vicomte de la Panouse that closer relations should be established between the local agents of the Allied Powers in Neutral Countries ; that they should meet from time to time to exchange ideas and to give each other full information as to their activities. General de la Panouse laid special stress upon the necessity of these local agents working in union with the diplomatic military representatives and with any other agencies engaged in the same kind of work. Emphasis was also laid upon this by Signor Emanuel. The Committee unanimously accepted this suggestion, with the proviso that the local agents should, if possible, be under the direction of the Central Committee to which they could refer for instructions and advice. Signor Emanuel proposed that pending the establishment of such a central body, the various Propaganda Departments should begin at once to exchange informa-tion about all that they are doing and that each should send out copies of all the material produced by it to the other departments. This was accepted, and measures adopted for the carrying out of the suggestion immediately. It was, of course, agreed that such circulation of material produced would be one of the chief activities of the proposed central body which would do it with greater rapidit3&apos; and effect.It is also agreed that such a central body could be most useful in employing methods for testing the effectiveness of Propaganda. The means of doing this at present were generally admitted to be defective. Only by co-ordinating effort and by comparing information could they be improved. It was decided that the present system of examining prisoners of war for purposes of military information ought to be supple-mented more than it is at present by a special further examination for the purposes of propaganda information, and it was suggested that special representatives of the Enemy Propaganda Departments should be allowed to conduct such examinations.Some important points connected with Propaganda brought to bear upon Germany through neutral countries were raised by Mr. Keeley, and it was agreed that the work of controlling and distributiong films for moving picture theatres which is to be done by an Inter-Allied Commission in Switzerland, ought to be extended to other neutral countries, especially Sweden. Mr. Keeley said his information was to the effect that German-owned picture theatres had of late increased very much in number both in Switzerland and in Scandinavia, and that these relied for the lighter part of their entertainments upon films from Allied Countries, Germany supplying special pro-paganda films. By controlling the supply of films from Allied Countries, the activity of these theatres could be very much diminished and possibly brought to an end.Another of Mr. Keeley&apos;s proposals, which the Committee adopted, was that it would be advisable to invite a number of neutral editors and newspaper writers to pay a visit to the United States. It was considered that articles describing what they saw and what they were able to judge of the feeling of the American nation would have a very useful effect upon German opinion.^ General de la Panouse suggested that it would be as well for them also to see the American effort in PYance, which they could do easily on their way to or from the United States. It was agreed that the party should represent all shades of opinion, and that representatives of Pro-German newspapers should, by no means, be excluded. The suggestion might be made with useful effect that they should also pay a visit to Germany and describe what they saw there.With a view to influencing German opinion, it was suggested and agreed that more use might be made of the Neue Korrespondenz News Agency in Berne, and that similar news agencies, to all appearance independent and self-supporting, might well be established in other neutral countries; that more efforts should be made to get
articles inserted in enemy newspapers, not controversial articles but statements of I what the Allies are doing, specially in the economic field, written as a German might I write them who was anxious about the future of his country; and that despatch I of Allied newspapers to neutral countries should be improved and extended so that 11 there might be more chance of their finding their way into Germany.Signed: IJ.

IAugust 24th, 1918.The following resolutions were then adopted.IThe Chairman (Viscount Northcliffe) moved, and M. Klobukowski seconded :      I&quot; That the report of the Committee on Policy be submitted by the heads of 1 the Missions, representing the three Allied Governments and the Government of 1 the United States of America to their respective Governments for their approval I and adoption ; and that the heads of those Missions be requested to inform the 1 Enemy Propaganda Department the earliest possible moment of the result of their I actions, in order that, in particular, the recommendations which it is proposed in I the report to communicate to the Jugo-Slav and the Polish National Committees I be so communicated.&quot; IThe Chairman moved, and Mr. James Keeley seconded : j&quot; That in view of the great importance of co-ordinating the Allies&apos; policies Iand organisations for the conduct of Propaganda in Enemy Countries, a permanent 1body be constituted for this purpose.  That this body consist of four members, Irepresenting respectively the four propaganda departments which have taken part in this Conference ; each member having the power to name an assistant or 1 a substitute, or both, if necessary ;&quot; That the provisional headquarters of the body be at Crewe House, London, I until permanent headquarters be determined ;&quot; That the establishment expenses be shared equally between the four Govern- 1 rnents, and that a permanent secretariat be appointed thereto; and that the I representatives of the Propaganda Departments who have taken part in this I Conference (or the heads of their departments respectively) be requested to inform I the Chairman of the Conference at the earliest possible moment of the names of I the representatives appointed;&quot; That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the four Governments 1 concerned.&quot; 1The Chairman moved and Captain Count Vicino Pallavicino seconded :&quot; That the report of the Committee on Distribution be submitted by the heads I of the Missions representing the three Allied Governments and the Government I
cf the United States of America to their respective Governments for their approval and adoption; and that the heads of those Missions be requested to inform the Enemy Propaganda Department at the earliest possible-moment of the result of their actions.&quot;The Chairman moved, and Mr. James Keeley seconded:&quot; That the report of the Committee on Material be submitted by the heads of the Missions representing the three Allied Governments and the Government of the United States of America to their respective Governments for their approval and adoption ; and that the heads of those Missions be requested to inform the Enemy Propaganda Department at the earliest possible moment of the result of their actions.&quot;At the First Meeting of the Conference on August 17th, the Chairman said :&quot; Your Excellencies and Gentlemen,&quot; In closing the proceedings of this Conference my first duty is to thank you for your assiduous co-operation in a work the importance of which, I firmly believe, is second to none as a means of winning the war and of winning the peace. The exhaustive discussions which have taken place, and the important resolutions adopted, should help to co-ordinate the efforts of the associated peoples and Governments in making plain to the enemy their unchangeable resolve and the character of the peace settlement which the Allies are determined to secure. In my opening statement I pointed out the value of Propaganda in Enemy Countries as an adjuct to military operations. One at least of the resolutions passed by the Policy Committee, whose report you-have now adopted, may hasten the process of disintegration in the Austro-Hungarian Army, which the Propaganda work already done has already stimulated. For this reason, and in order that the military dispositions of the enemy.may not deprive your work of any particle of its efficacy, I would express to our honoured guest, the Head of the Italian Mission, Professor Borgese, the hope that it will be his especial care to bring the resolution in regard -to the adoption of the initiative by the Italian Government in promoting a joint Allied declaration upon the establishment of a free and united Jugo-Slav State to the notice of his immediate chief, and through him to the Italian Government without avoidable delay.&quot;Among the other valuable resolutions and recommendations which have been sanctioned, that concerning the constitution of. a permanent Inter-Allied body has a special importance. I believe that the adoption of this resolution is a step towards that general co-ordination of Allied purpose and organisation which the experience of the war has proved to be a postulate of rapidity and efficiency of action.&quot; It remains once more to thank you for your acceptance of my invitation, and to express the hope that when next we meet we may already have begun to reap the fruits of our labours in the form of the increasing discouragement of the enemy forces and the growing certainty among allied peoples that victory, complete, just, and final, is at length in sight.&quot;M. Klobukowski (who spoke in French and was interpreted by. Lieut. P. Mantoux), said:&quot; I wish only to say a few words to associate myself unreservedly, and in the most friendly manner, with the declarations which have been so clearly and so definitely made by Lord Northcliffe. I believe that the continuance of our work will bring about most desirable results, and I should like to emphasize the great desirability of having a permanent secretariat established and constituted so as to give the greatest possible results.   As to the question of procedure how to
arrange and work it this will be a subject for further examination with your departments.&quot; I am very glad, also, to have this opportunity of thanking the British Government for their gracious hospitality, and you also, gentlemen, for the charming reception you have given, less to us personally than to the countries j we represent.&quot; At the beginning of this war, the strong basis of our agreement and co-operation with the community of interests, and our common esteem and regard.   But and f am speaking especially of the country whose guests we are to-day, between whom and us mutual esteem has developed into a  feeling of  deeply-rooted   affection   on  the  day  when  the   Germans, i breaking their  pledged  word, invaded Belgium, we   saw Great   Britian f stepping forward, faithful to her word; we saw her coming to our side to j light the common enemy of Right and Liberty.   We cannot forget the capital part taken in that momentous movement by the great press of this country, j Lord Northcliffe will allow me to say a few words on the courage and clearsighted-1 ness of articles which appeared at that time in the columns he knows so well; and it would not be fair not to mention here also the name of Mr. Wickham Steed. I was then in Belgium, and reading those articles I felt no doubt that the whole problem would instantly change.   We felt that the result of such strong and eloquent appeals would be the formation of the solid phalanx which now unites together the free peoples of Great Britain, the United States, Italy, and France, to secure the rights of peoples and the future of mankind. For the great press of this free country to have raised the flag at that time gives it an imperishable title to our common gratitude, and this was the first and greatest instance of what could fe be done by Propaganda.&quot;Signor Borgese (Italy), said :.&quot;Permit me to express, in my own name and in the name of the Italiani people and the Government, my best thanks for the friendly hospitality extendedI to us by Lord Northcliffe and the British Government, and my satisfaction atl the real and great work we have been able to do in the few sittings of our&apos; Congress.&quot; Lord Northcliffe has devoted a part of his last speech personally to me. IB thank him for the honour, and assure him that I accept his suggestion, and will If do what is in my power to forward our propaganda work against Austria and in! J favour of the Austro-Hungarian nationalities.  It is not the place and moment,;! and it would be superfluous, to explain in detail,&quot;the difficulties under w ichjf Italians labour in regard to such questions; but it may perhaps be useful once I more to repeat that we can rely on final success, because in this respect Italy has i always been the pioneer ; the programme for the freedom of Austro-Hungarian I and Balkan nationalities arose in the first place in Italy; and at periods when no 1 one could believe the accomplishment of this programme to be possible, we have I had men and parties who supported it; and the whole of the nation in its innermost I conscience, believed that this was its chief task, and that the one and only way to I eradicate German militarism was the suppression of the Austrian system. Everyone I knows that the first great pioneer of the anti-Austrian idea was an Italian well I known in England Mazzini, whose ideas coincided most closely with those sol eloquently expressed by President Wilson.&quot; I have explained what are the formal difficulties that in some respects stand f in the way of an immediate realisation of this programme. I know that owl Allies will not forget that only Italy among the Allies, finds herself in the position f that in order to realise the ideal programme of the war she must consider the I
possibility of granting some concessions to a potential ally. While for the other the problem of the Austro-Hungarian nationalities presents practically only a problem of theoretical choice, for Italy it includes the problem of practical choice. In any case agreement between Italians and Jugo-Slavs includes the necessity for the renunciation of some portion of territories and of kindred populations bound to us by intimate ties of affection and of historical tradition. Everyone, I think, will acknowledge the great task Italy has had in connection with this policy, and the courage, assiduity and generosity that have been necessary, and are every day necessary for pursuance of this programme. Every day, we are confronted with serious difficulties. Last night I heard that a great Jugo-Slav meeting had been held at Laibach, at which declarations were made concerning the frontier&apos;i between Jugoslavia and Italy, which were liable to wound Italian national feeling. Therefore, I am very glad that the Conference has adopted the resolutions proposed by me, which will have the effect of making our task at least a little easier. I repeat that I believe these difficulties to be only formal and temporary, and that the generosity and idealism of the Italian nation will overcome them. I hope I may be able shortly to inform Lord Northcliffe&apos;s Department that the desired result has been achieved a result which would have an extremely important bearing upon our work at a moment, which, as I have already said, is an important one for propaganda. The intensity of political thought and of the political preparation for peace is growing every day. The idea that peace will only be born at a diplomatic congress has long ceased to be held. We know now that with the development of war we have at the same time witnessed the development of peace. The proposed Permanent Board which will very soon be created, and the meetings we shall have in Paris and in Rome will be extremely useful, if only because meetings in Rome afford our Allies direct knowledge of Italian opinion and public feeling. We are in the presence every day of the increasing influence of democratic public opinion upon great historical questions. On the other hand, the technical necessities of war have created a very powerful censorship that renders impossible public meetings or the publication of newspaper articles expressing the substance of public opinion on all questions of peace. This opinion is very powerful, but, on account of the censorship, it lacks an instrument. While it is strong, it is largely secret. We may be able to constitute an intermediary instrument between this public opinion and our Governments. I think that the possibilities before us are very great indeed. Every new meeting between us is a step forward in the solidification of our real agreement. We have now the possibility of ascertaining world opinion, and also the possibility of speaking clearly and of expressing this general human thought to our Governments. I think, therefore, that not only the technical but the political proposals that have arisen at our Conference will exercise the greatest possible influence upon the development of events.&quot; Let me conclude with a remark that corresponds with one made, by M. Klobukowski that every meeting of the four Great Powers which are fighting against Germanism is a new proof of the continually increasing intimacy of our reciprocal friendship and confidence; and even in this sense propaganda does good work, because we realise that these feelings of mutual confidence and friendship are far more productive than actual agreements between official diplomatists.&quot;Mr. James Keeley (United States of America) said : &quot; I beg to associate myself with all that has been said by Lord Northcliffe in regard to this Conference, I think I can say for the United States Government that our desire is to get to work at once, and as vigorously as possible on the work we have been discussing here.   Since this Conference was convened, I have had
one or two cables in connection with the subject we are discussing; and I may summarise them very briefly by saying that it is the intention of the Government of the United States to back to the limit this is an exact quotation the propaganda that our Government has already started on this side of the Atlantic and to put into that work every ounce of strength, every avenue of execution that it is possible to use.   We believe that we should preach, and we are going to try and preach, the inevitability of victory that there is no uncertainty a to the outcome of the war ; and our belief is that the sooner that can be driven home the better it will be for every one concerned.&quot; I trust that as a result of this first Conference we shall all get to wor speedily, unitedly and effectively.   I feel that is guaranteed by this first meeting and that subsequent meetings will make such action more certain.&quot;The Chairman said : &quot; Before we part I should just like to make one or two remarks.&quot; I have had a semi-official communication about the disposal of propaganda by aeroplanes. I think, as a matter of fact, that we have been fighting so tremendously in the air in the last few weeks, that it is not right to expect the fighting men to give their attention to brain propaganda instead of bullet propaganda; but I am hopeful that with the coming of the increased military output it will become possible to have an independent Air Force for Propaganda as for bombing German towns.&apos;&apos; The extraordinary harmony that has existed throughout this Conference-I am sure that had you gathered a homogeneous body of English, French or Italian business men, it could not have been more harmonious than this polyglot Conference has been. In spite of all kinds of possibilities of jealousy, there has been none I have been to the Front nine or ten times and there is no more jealousy between the Armies than between football or baseball teams---) ust about as much ! I can only think that this harmony is due to the fact that every person engaged in this war knows that it is the greatest task ever placed upon humanity.&quot;I am greatly pleased with the harmonious way in which this Conference has gone, and I am certain that each of us will be able to have some influence upon his own Government to bring about a mighty increase of propaganda, and thus work towards a very real peace.&quot;One small, but very useful, practical, outcome of the Conference was an arrangement for the regular exchange of propaganda material issued by the various departments. In this connec tion it may be fitly mentioned here that after the signing of the armistice, Commandant Chaix head of the French Military Propaganda in Enemy Countries Section, expressed to Lord Northcliffe, with the full concurrence of M. Clemenceau, the opinion that the leaflets issued from Crewe House had had a marked effect in bringing about the collapse of the German morale which ended the war.
the policy committee:.During the Autumn as it became more and more clear that the continued pressure Upon the ^&quot;German armies, and the result of the intensified propaganda effort, were undermining the German confidence in victory, it occurred to the Committee that the approach of peace made it more than ever necessary to circulate propaganda addressed to the enemy, to neutrals and to allies.It was evident that, as the war approached its end, propaganda would be needed to accustom the world and especially the Germans, to the idea of the peace which the allies were resolved to make. Such propaganda, however, could only be prepared and launched after an agreement had been reached as to what the nature of this peace would be. No sufficiently full or sufficiently definite statements on the subject had been made by the British Government; it was plain that, if the war ended suddenly, we should be taken by surprise.It was decided, therefore, to proceed on the lines followed at the outset of the Committee&apos;s labours and to draw up a basis of policy for peace propaganda which could be submitted to the War Cabinet for approval or alteration. It seemed, however, desirable that this basis of policy should not be the work of Crewe House alone as the earlier documents were, but ought to be discussed by representatives of all departments in any way concerned with propaganda work. Invitations were, therefore, addressed to :The War Cabinet, The Treasury, The Ministry of Information,The Admiralty, - The Air Ministry, The War Aims Committee,The War Office,        .    The Colonial Office,        The Overseas Bureau ; The Foreign Office,        The India Office, each was asked to appoint a representative to attend the meetings of a Policy Committee.In the meantime a basis of policy, largely following the outlines of President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points, but in certain particulars adding to them, was drafted at Crewe House by the heads of all sections, devoting tc this task a large amount of time and thought. When the Policy Committee was constituted it had, therefore, a definite task awaiting it. This task, the considera-tion of the draft, it began at once.At the first meeting of the Committee on October 4th, Sir Campbell Stuart, Deputy Chairman of the British War Mission, made the following explanatory statement:&quot; I have first of all to express the regret on behalf of Lord Northcliffe that it is not possible for him to be with you to-day as he had confidently hoped. He trusts to have the pleasure of meeting you at the next meeting of this Committee.&quot; He has summoned you together as he believes that the Policy Committee of the British War Mission can perform a very important duty at the present time.&quot; Hitherto our enemy work has fallen into three divisions : (1) Propaganda in Austria ; (2) Propaganda in Bulgaria and the Balkans ; (3) Propaganda in Germany.&quot; Whatever results it has been able to achieve have proceeded mainly from the circumstances that it has in each case been based upon definite policies in regard to the countries concerned. These policies have all been submitted to and have received the approval of our Government. The advantages of this procedure are obvious It enables propagandists to work on consistent lines without fear that the representations they make to the enemy will be contradicted by actual occurrences. In this way, propaganda representations have had a cumulative effect. If, for instance, enemy troops are at first inclined to regard our representations with scepticism, they are gradually convinced by the force of events that we were telling them the truth from the outset, and that consequently subsequent representations deserve serious attention. Another advantage has proceeded from the obvious circumstances that as Allied policy must correspond to the aims which the Allies are determined to secure at the peace,
the representation of that policy to propaganda is in harmony with the war aims of the Allies, and is strengthened by every successive declaration by Allied statesmen of the objects for which they are fighting. A third advantage is that the propaganda of tin&apos; enemy cannot destroy the effects of our propaganda without gaining such military&apos; successes as to render the Allied war aims themselves unattainable. Consequently every Allied victory that brings the war aims nearer attainment enhances also the efficacy of propaganda.&quot;&quot; At the outset our efforts were naturally tentative and experimental. Their real value could only be proved by the test of experience, This test has now been applied in Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Germany. As against Austria-Hungary, our propaganda contributed to the defeat of the Austrians on the Piave in June, and had our efforts not been thwarted in a hundred ways by political short-sightedness and some personal intrigue on the part of the Italian authorities, it is certain that much greater headway would have been made and. that the Italian armies would now have been in a much more favourable position. As it is, the policy of liberating the Austro-Hungarian subject races, upon which our propaganda has been based, has already had a marked effect in the interior of the Dual Monarchy, and has brought large sections of the inhabitants to the point of revolt. This will be clear when it is said that the Italo-Jugo-Slav agreement of last March, the Rome Congress of the Hapsburg subject races of April, with its sequel in the declaration by the Allies and the United States to the Poles, Czecho-Slovaks and Southern Slavs, as well as the actual&apos; recognition of the Czecho-Slovaks and the prospective recognition of the Jugo-Slavs as Allied and belligerent nations, have all been influenced, if not directly promoted, by the efforts of this Department.&quot; As regards Bulgaria, our propaganda has been mainly negative. It has consisted in the definite rejection of Bulgarian overtures until there should be a complete reversal of Bulgarian policy. That reversal has now taken place, and has opened up further prospects of propaganda against Austria-Hungary of which we propose speedily to take advantage.&quot; The work in Germany has been positive and negative. Its aim has been to give the German people something to hope for and much to fear in other words, to make it clear to them that the only way to escape complete ruin would be to break with the system that brought the war upon Europe, and to qualify for admission into a League of Nations on the Allied terms. In addition to these educative efforts, we have supplied the enemy armies with constant and invariably truthful information about the actual military position. The news which the German military authorities were withholding from their troops has been supplied by us. Hence the cries of alarm on the part of Hindenburg and von Hutier. Nevertheless, much remains to be done both in the direction of increasing the output and the dissemination of actual propaganda material, and in the co-ordination of the efforts of all Government Departments so as to make the general work of propaganda as rapid and as efficient as possible. Much use has unfortunately deprived the term &apos; propa-ganda &apos; of its real meaning. In its true sense it means the education of the enemy to a knowledge of what kind of world the Allies mean to create, and of the place reserved in it for enemy peoples according as they assist in, or. continue to resist, its creation. It implies also the dissemination of this knowledge among the Allied peoples, so that there may be full popular support for Allied policy and no tendency at the critical moment of peace to sacrifice any essential feature of the settlement because its impor-tance may not have been explained or understood in time. Next to the actual work of fighting the enemy on land and sea, there is no more important work than this ; and the joint intelligence and energy of all Departments of the Government are required to accomplish it successfully. For this reason we have welcomed warmly the suggestion that this council of representatives of the Government Departments chiefly concerned should be formed, in order that there may be less dispersion of effort, less overlapping.
\ 59iand greater mutual comprehension of the work which each department is striving to do, and fuller co-ordination in the direction of all those efforts to one single end. 1 &quot;I would like further to remark that as the war approaches its end, enemyI propaganda must gradually pass into peace offensives and counter offensives.   OurMission, therefore, has already in existence an organisation to collect and collate various suggestions, territorial, political, economic, and so forth, that have been made by the different sections and parties in Allied, neutral and enemy countries.  A step in this I direction was the report on the Propaganda Library issued by the War Office earlyj in 1917 by Captain Chalmers Mitchell, who is the liaison officer between the british war Mission and the War Office, and whom we have asked to act as Secretary of this j Committee.   Captain Chalmers Mitchell is in charge of the aforesaid organisation at.j Crewe House, and although its immediate function is to collect information useful for propaganda, it is clear that it will also obtain materials useful to those who have to I shape peace policy.  For propaganda to the enemy is in a sense a forcast of policy ;^ it must be inspired by policy, but at the same time its varying needs also suggest policy.&quot;It is hoped, therefore, that this Policy Committee may assist in furnishing materials for the compilation of the various peace proposals, in revising the collation of them, in drawing inferences from them, and discussing the action and reaction of I peace propaganda and peace policy that the inferences suggest.&quot;The Policy Committee then decided to undertake the immediate study of peace terms.On October 8th, the consideration of the draft of propaganda policy prepared by Crewe House (with special reference to the German Peace Note) was begun. Lord Northcliffe presided at the meeting which also had the advantage of the advice of Dr. Headlam Morley of the Foreign Office Political Intelligence Department. The draft statement was discussed in detail, and after certain modifications and alterations had been agreed to, was adopted in principle. It was then agreed that a meeting should be held next day to consider the revised draft.At the meeting held on October 9th, the revised draft was adopted and it was agreed that it should be submitted to the War Cabinet with a view to its being approved as a basis for propaganda relating to Peace.The Policy Committee was now composed of: Lord Northcliffe, ChairmanMajor General Sir George Aston, K.C.B. (War Cabinet) The D.N.I. -  \T1    ...  uCaptain Sir Guy Gaunt) The AdmiraltY &apos; The D.M.I. \T,   ...Lt.-Colonel Gribbon/lhe War 0fhce Mr. C. J.

Guest JCaptain Chalmers Mitchell, War Office Liaison Officer, acted as Secretary of the Committee.
The next meeting was held on October 19th, A letter was read from Sir Maurice Hankej to Lord Northcliffe, dated October 15th, stating that the Memorandum on Peace Propagand Policy had been before the War Cabinet. The War Cabinet had requested the Secretary o State for Foreign Affairs to examine the document on their behalf with a view to securing tha&apos; it was in all respects consistent with the policy of the British Government. After this ha been done, the War Cabinet sanctioned the use of the document for propaganda purposes.The Secretary reported that Mr. Balfour, through Mr. Phillips, had asked Mr. Wickha Steed and himself to go to the Foreign Office to discuss the draft memorandum.   At an interviev on October 18th, the memorandum had been discussed, clause by clause, and modified in vario respects.   Mr. Balfour had then said that the document as amended might be used unofficiall as propaganda policy.Copies of the memorandum in the form approved were distributed and the changes tha had been made were explained.   It was then agreed to endeavour to obtain Mr. Balfour&apos;s consen to a further modification of the reference to the Colonies, so as to make it clear that the Germ colonies were in no case to be returned to Germany.This consent was obtained, and the memorandum in its final form read as follows :PROPAGANDA PEACE POLICY.The following conditions are indisputable :In no sense shall restoration or reparation in the case of Belgium be taken int consideration when adjusting any other claims arising from the War.1. The complete restoration, territorial, economic, and political, of Belgium.2. The freeing of French territory, reconstruction of the invaded Provinc compensation for all civilian losses and injuries.3. The restoration to Prance of Alsace-Lorraine, not as a territorial acquisitio or part of a war indemnity, but as reparation for the wrong done in 1871, when tk inhabitants of the two Provinces, whose ancestors voluntarily chose French allegianc were incorporated in Germany against their will.4. Re-adjustment of the frontiers of Italy as nearly as possible along the lin of nationality.5. The assurance to all the peoples of Austria-PIungary of their place among the free nations of the world and of their right to enter into union with their kindre beyond the present boundaries of Austria-Hungary.6. The evacuation of all territory formerly included in the boundaries of tl Russian Empire, the annulment of all treaties, contracts or agreements made wit subjects, agents or representatives of Enemy Powers since the revolution and affectic territory or interests formerly Russian, and co-operation of the Associated Powers&apos; securing conditions under which the various nationalities of the former Empire Russia shall determine their own form of Government.7. The formation of an independent Polish State with access to the sea, whi State shall include the territories inhabited by predominently Polish populatio and in the indemnification of Poland by the Powers responsible for the havoc wrong!8. The abrogation of the Treaty of Bucharest, the evacuation and restorati of Rumania, Serbia and Montenegro, the Associated Powers to aid the Balkan Stat in settling finally the Balkan question on an equitable basis.9. The removal, so far as is practicable, of Turkish dominion over all non-Turki peoples.-  10. The people of Schleswig shall be free to determine their own allegiance.
11. As reparation for the illegal submarine warfare waged by Germany and Austria-Hungary, these Powers shall be held liable to replace the merchant tonnage belonging to the Associated and Neutral Nations illegally damaged or destroyed.12. The appointment of a tribunal before which there shall be brought for impartial justice individuals of any of the belligerents accused of offences against the laws of war or of humanity.13.

The adjustment of claims for damage necessarily arising from the operations of war, and not included amongst the indisputable conditions.2. The establishment, constitution and conditions of membership of a League of Free Nations for the purpose of preventing future wars and improving international relations.3. The League ofNFree Nations shall be inspired by the resolve of the Associated Powers to create a world in which, when the conditions of the Peace have been carried out, there shall be opportunity and security for the legitimate development of all peoples.It was agreed that copies of the memorandum should be sent to the members of the unmittee and that they should report to the next meeting as to the action they had taken proposed to take. It was also emphasised .that the memorandum, though approved as a isis of propaganda, must not be issued as an official document.There was much public discussion in this country and in the United States as to theIterpretation of President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points and a tendency to assume that these lints were not so much a statement of attitude as a categorical and final statement of terms. )rd Northcliffe, having undertaken to address American Officers at the Washington Inn onSbtober 22nd, the Crewe House Committee thought that this would be an excellent unofficial i)opportunity of making known the main points of the Peace Memorandum.   They asked him, lerefore, to deal with the matter, and the following is the text of his address on the occasion jferred to :I &quot; The air is full perhaps too full of rumours of peace, of proposals for an armistice, and of professions of good behaviour on the part of our enemies. President [I Wilson has dealt most ably with the various German suggestions made to him hitherto, as I, and with me the great mass of my fellow-countrymen, never for one instant doubted that he would. Nor do I doubt that he will deal, as it deserves, with the newest German attempt to gain time and to confuse the issue. We are in the presence of the great enemy peace offensive which we always knew would come when the enemy felt himself beaten on the battlefield. Unless we face it resolutely, with united hearts and clear minds, it may prove more dangerous to us than were his military offensives on March 21st and on July 15th. The first of those offensives gave us the inestimable boon of an effectively unified military command. That unification enabled the genius of Marshal Foch to turn the offensive of July 18th into the beginning of a German disaster. You know how long and how steadfastly our Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, strove for the unification of the military command against difficulties which, when they^come to be recounted in later years, will seem almost incredible and incredibly foolish. That has been one of the great services perhaps the greatest that he has ever rendered to the common cause. Could the present German peace offensive bring us another inestimable boon, in the shape of a united peace programme, carefully co-ordinated between the Governments of the associated Powers, it would also prove to have been a blessing indeed. In the hour of military trial no personal or national susceptibilities were allowed to stand in the way of the unification of the military command.  Noneit
can now be allowed to impede the unification of the Allied peace purpose. I shudder to think of what our plight might be were the representatives of the peoples who have borne so nobly the trials and sacrifices of this great war to enter, with divided counsels or divergent aspirations, into negotiations with a subtle cunning, and unscrupulous enemy. That peril must at all costs be avoided ; and if associated peoples have their way, it will be avoided.&quot; Some timid voices warn us to have a care lest, by discouraging the enemy&apos;s &apos; will to peace&apos; and desire for reform, we throw Germany into chaos and foster the spread of&apos; Bolshevism.&apos; Bolshevism by which, I presume, social upheaval or revolu-tion is meant, for Bolshevism in itself is a peculiarly Russian blend of anarchy, burglary, blood-lust, and pro-Germanism is not a plant likely to flourish in its Russian form on German soil. I notice, however, that it is precisely the German Press which shares the queer anxiety of some of our public men lest Bolshevism find its way through Germany into Entente countries. I may be dense, I may not know the feelings of the masses of my fellow-citizens though I have some means of judging them but of one thing I am convinced there is a real danger of social upheaval, Bolshevism, revolution or whatever you like to call it, in this country and in other Allied countries, if an unsatisfactory peace is made. As to the feelings aroused in your country by extraordinary unexpected Landownisms, such as those of Lord Milner, a very respected member of the Government, I cannot do better than read to you an extract from a cable received from a friend in the United States :&quot; &apos; Public opinion is puzzled by Milner&apos;s statement of this morning.&apos;&quot; Were our workers to feel that their blood has been shed in vain, their heroism wasted, their privations uselessly endured, their efforts rendered unavailing, by weakness short-sightedness, incompetence, or vanity, on the part of the Government responsible for the welfare of this country, I verily believe that there would be an outbreak of wrath in which many of our institutions might vanish like the fabric of a dream. But, short of this, and on condition that we are as steadfast in making peace as we have been in making war; on condition that we keep Justice and Reparation before our eyes, there is, I firmly believe, no doubt whatever that peace, when it comes, will find us, as it will find our Allies and associates, stronger, healthier, more vigorous, and sounder in every way than we were before Prussian rapacity compelled us to draw the sword.IRREDUCIBLE PEACE TERMS.&quot; How are we to make this peace ? What are to be its terms ? Are we to haggle with the Germans about them ? No! Our Government, every associated Government, must make up, or, if need be, must be made to make up, its own mind and to agree with its fellows. Then, with minds made up, they must tell the Germans what our irreducible terms are irreducible, because framed strictly in accordance with justice-and the Germans must take them or leave them at their peril. It is not for private citizens like me to lay down in detail the terms of peace; but some of the main principles they must embody are present in all our minds.&quot; First comes Belgium. For her there must be complete restoration in every sense \  territorial, economic, and political; the replacement, or provision for the replacement j of machinery stolen, of civilian bank deposits that have been looted, and of the thousands j thefts committed with calculated greed by an unspeakable foe. And on no pretext whatever shall this restoration and reparation be taken into consideration in framing j the demands to be made on Germany for her wrongdoing. The &apos; pawn &apos; theory must j be definitely ruled out. Next comes France, invincible France, whose Northern j Provinces have been laid waste, whose sons and daughters have been tortured and \ enslaved, whose factories have been looted, whose very fruit-trees have been deliberately i destroyed,  She too, must have full reparation and restoration,  To&apos; her also must be I
returned the Provinces torn from her in 1871. They must .be returned not as a territorial acquisition or part of a war indemnity, but in redress of the wrong done when the inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine, whose ancestors voluntarily chose French citizenship, were incorporated in Germany against their will. Next comes Italy, who has unredeemed brethren to redeem, and rightly claims such a frontier that she shall no longer have a malignant foe lurking in her gate. I know that some details of her claims may be difficult of adjustment; but I confide in the wisdom of her gallant people and in the right-mindedness of those who will be her eastern neighbours, to render possible the friendly settlement of many a point that has in the past seemed thorny. In seeking this settlement, I am sure that both Italy and her eastern neighbours may be assured of the helpful goodwill of all the Allies and of the United States.&quot;As to Austria-Hungary that distressful Monarchy whose subject peoples yearn to escape from its step-motherly yoke President Wilson &apos;s fine answer to her proposal for an armistice points the way which we have to follow. The Hapsburg peoples must be assured of their place among the free nations of the world and of their right to enter freely into union with their kindred. This applies not only to the Rumanians, Ruthenians, and Jugo-Slavs, but also to that indestructible and tenacious Polish people, whose unification, within frontiers including all predominently Polish populations and with access to the sea, has already been declared by the Allies to be a condition of a just and lasting peace and of the rule of right in Europe. The sturdy Czecho-Slovaks must have union and liberty. Nor should we forget Serbia, Montenegro, and Rumania, who are entitled to full restoration and indemnification, nor Greece, whose national leader, the great Venezelos, actually made a revolution to bring her alongside the Allies, and whose kindred are calling to her from the sea and across the sea. Still less should we fail to remember Russia in her dire distress. She needs all out help and sympathy. The interests of her peoples are the interests of all of us ; and as President Wilson truly said, our treatment of her &apos; will be the acid test of our goodwill.&apos; You will ask me about Turkey. I have no special love for the Turks, but wish them no special harm once their blighting rule shall, as far as is humanly practicable, have been removed from all non-Turkish peoples. The Armenians, the Arabs, and, by no means least, the Jews, have a right to our solicitude and to the application in their favour of those principles of ordered freedom for which we have all been fighting and shall fight until the end.RIGHT AND SECURITY.&quot; I have said nothing of this country and of the other British Commonwealths. Nor will &apos;I venture to trespass on a sphere which is manifestly that of His Majesty&apos;s responsible Ministers. One thing, however, I can say, without fear of indiscretion. We did not enter the war in the hope of gain. We fought to uphold a treaty obligation which had been incurred in bygone generations in obedience to an essential postulate of our national security. We fought for right, and we fought for security and a righteous peace will be the main bulwark of our security. We intend that peace shall vidicate the right and maintain our security not only the security of these islands, but that of our sister nations, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, and of our great Dependencies oversea. The conditions under which we in these islands and our oversea kindred can alone live and thrive must be upheld. As to the former colonies of Germany, we are resolved on one thing. They shall in no case be restored to Germany. We will not deliver their native inhabitants again to the tender mercies of the Hun, nor allow him to use their harbours as submarine bases from which he&quot; might paralyse the seaborne traffic which is the lifeblood of our great commonwealth of free peoples.&quot; I have said enough perhaps too much on this all-engrossing topic of peace terms. What I have said is the result of some inquiry and much reflection. Nothing I have said should be taken to imply any lukewarmness with regard to the great
ideal of a League of Free Nations, which, as President Wilson has truly said, will be needed to guarantee the peace. I firmly believe that it is in marching progressively, slowly it may be, but steadily, towards the practical realization of that ideal that the salvation of mankind will be found.&quot;At a meeting of the Policy Committee at Crewe House on October 28th, the action of the various departments on the memoradum was stated and approved.The Crewe House Committee reported first as to Lord Northcliffe&apos;s address at the Washington Inn ; next that the production department of the Enemy Propaganda Committee was engaged on a series of pamphlets and leaflets dealing with different points of the terms; third that a reasoned statement covering the whole ground, and showing what Germany had to gain in the end, was being drafted for publication, the idea being that it should appear as an article or as a speech to which wide circulation would be given; and lastly that the secretary of the permanent Inter-Allied Body for Propaganda in Enemy Countries had written to the French, Italian and American members of that body enclosing a copy of the Peace Policy Memorandum and suggesting that they should take action similar to that of the British Policy Committee and bring the subject up for discussion at the next meeting of the Inter-Allied Body. (It may be mentioned here that the rapid course of events prevented the contemplated meeting of the Inter-Allied Body).Captain Guest stated that the mode of using the Memorandum had been under the consideration of the National War Aim Committee, that Mr. Asquith had taken exception to some of its contents, but that when the origin of the document had been explained to Mr. Asquith, he hoped that the War Aims Committee would reach unanimity on the matter.On behalf of the Colonial Office it was stated that copies of the memoranda were being sent to the Colonies and Dependencies.Lieut.-Colonel Buchan reported that at the Ministry of Information he had met the controller, that it had been decided not to deal with the memoradum as a whole, bat to have a number ol defensive points made out for each heading. It was agreed that Lieut.-Colonel Buchan and Mr. Hamilton Fyfe should confer as to joint action in the preparation of leaflets covering the separate points.On behalf of the War Office it was stated that the Memorandum was being used as a guide in the production of propaganda.This was the last meeting of the Policy Committee. There remains to be set forth the fina result of their work. Crewe House as explained above, had stated its intention of drafting at article covering the whole ground of the Memorandum in such a way that the policy could to presented in the same terms to our own people, to our Allies and to the enemy. It was foun impracticable to get such an article published quickly enough in a high-class magazine, or to gel an immediate occasion for making it the text ,of a speech. Under these circumstances thi Committee asked their chairman, Viscount Northcliffe, to give the Peace Policy the wide publicity possible by the use of his name and by the sources of distribution which he was abl to command. Lord Northcliffe agreed, and accordingly produced the article which follows ant which was a full statement of the agreed policy. He arranged for its simultaneous publicatioi in the London Press and at his own expense had it cabled to the remotest parts of the world In exact compliance with the authority given by the War Cabinet, there was no mention madeo! the history of the document. As stated in the House of Commons by the representative of tit Treasury, the document was unofficial.As, however, statements appeared in the Press suggesting that Lord Northcliffe had madt use of a confidential document which had happened to pass through his hands, it is as well I: repeat briefly the history that has been set forth here. The Memorandum which formed tin basis of Lord NorthclifiVs article was drafted by a sub-committee which he himself appointed was modified and adopted by the Policy Committee formed at his suggestion and of which h himself was chairman.  Its purpose was to form the basis of a policy of publicity and the fac
mt it was proposed to elaborate it into a complete statement for publication was announced beforehand and approved by the Policy Committee.  This is the text of the article from The Jimes of November 4th :&quot;FROM WAR TO PEACE. &quot; Now that peace is at last in sight, I hear the question being asked on all sides, &apos; How are we to pass from war conditions to peace conditions ? &apos; This cannot be done by a sudden and dramatic declaration like the declaration which in August, 1914, changed peace into war. It must be a slow and laborious process a process with, as it seems to me, at least three distinct and successive stages. Out of these stages will be formed the organic whole which will constitute the machinery for replacing war conditions by peace conditions.&quot; It is important to get these three stages clearly outlined in our imaginations, and it is important also to bear in mind that each stage will smooth the path for its successor precisely in proportion to the sincerity and thoroughness with which it has been completed. There is but one goal for those who are honest and far-seeing. That goal is to create a condition of the world in which there shall be opportunity and security for the legitimate development of all peoples. The road is long and difficult, but I believe that its course is already clear enough to be described, in the same words, to those who are our friends and to those who are now our enemies.tI.&quot; The first stage is the cessation of hostilitites. Here, whether they cease on account of an armistice or by-reason of surrender, there can be. no question as the &apos; Honour&apos; of the German people, or as to any adjustment of the conditions to any supposed strategical or actual strength of the Central Powers.&quot; If they feel humiliated, they must blame those who brought humiliation upon them ; and as to military strength, the semi-official organ of the German Government, the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, has admitted that our reserves are such as Germany cannot compete with. &apos; It is clear&apos; said this newspaper on October 12th, &apos; that if we systematically continued the war in this way, fighting might go on for a long time. The annihilation of the German Army is still a long Way from attainment; we still have a quantity of unspent forces at our command in the recruit depots behind the front, in the reserved battalions, and at home. But doubtless there are certain limits to all this on our side, whereas our enemies chiefly America are in a position to replace men and materials on an ever increasing scale.&apos;&quot;Another equally important admission I found in the MiinchnerNeueste Nachrichten, the leading South-German organ, on.October 25th. &apos; A German retreat beyond the frontier,&apos; this journal said, &apos; and especially an advance by the enemy to the frontier, would render the German situation much worse, as it would expose Germany&apos;s industrial territory to the Entente&apos;s artillery fire, and particularly their air attacks, while the danger to the enemy&apos;s industrial districts would be correspondingly removed. This condition alone would not only secure the enemy&apos;s military preponderance but would increase it.&apos;&quot; Thus it is clear that Germany, deprived now of the help of her allies, recognizes her hopeless situation. The conditions upon which hostilities can cease must be laid down by the military and naval leaders of the Associated Powers and accepted by the Central Powers in such form that no resumption of hostilities is possible.&quot; And this I will say : the spirit in which Germany accepts these stern and necessary conditions will do much to determine the course of future events. If she haggles over the conditions, or is sullen and obstructive in her mode of carrying them out, then our profound distrust of her spirit and motives will survive into the subsequent stages and still further delay that re-establishment of tolerable relations which must be our object.   But if Germany by word and deed makes plain her abandonment of that
belief in might which her rulers, supported until recently by the majority of her people have used as a menace to the power of right, the greatest obstacle in the path of equal justice will have been removed. l&quot; By a stroke of the pen, in accepting the conditions of armistice, or by a merl gesture of unconditional surrender, Germany can cause fighting to cease. Naturally; the business of evacuation and of re-occupation will have to be conducted by concert between the military and naval leaders. The first governing condition in these operations and detailed arrangements will be the safety of the peace. The second condition will be the security of civilijan life and property. The emotional backgrount to all this will be a daily increasing desire on the part of all to get back to normal conditions of life. Co-operation and agreement will be required, not so much to secure that demobilisation and disarmament shall be forced sternly on those who havt surrendered as to secure that each side takes its fair share in the burden of maintaining order and in facilitating the change from military to civilian organisation.II.&quot; The second stage of the passage from war conditions to peace conditions wil begin as soon as it is certain that security has been obtained for the permanence of the first stage. It will consist in the acceptance by Germany of certain principles a: indisputable. The security provided in the first stage ought to be sufficient to enabli us to pass through the second stage quickly. With sufficient guarantees there neet be no waiting to see whether the transformation of the German Government front irresponsible autocracy to responsible democracy is as genuine as it is representec to be, or whether the changed professions of those who speak for the People represent a change of heart.&quot; The indisputable principles which Germany must accept in this second stags have been stated in different forms at different times, but the consensus of opinioi amongst all classes of the Associated Powers seems to me to be so clear that it is not difficult to state them objectively in a form very close to that which they are likelj to assume in their final enunciation.&quot; The first is the complete restoration, territorial, economic, and political, o Belgium. In this there can be no reservation, no bargaining, no attempt to rais counter-claims or offsets of any kind. By her initial violation of International Law and by her subsequent treatment of Belgium, Germany has forfeited all right ti discussion. Reparation is impossible, but she must undertake restoration in such form and measure as shall be indicated to her.&quot; 2. The freeing of French territory, reconstruction of the invaded provinces compensation for all civilian losses and injuries. Here again reparation in any id sense of the word is beyond human power, but Germany must accept the full burde; of material reconstruction, replacement, and compensation, again in such form an measure as shall be laid down.&quot; 3. The restoration to France of Alsace-Lorraine, not as a territorial acquisitiot or part of a war indemnity, but as reparation for the wrong done in 1871, when tit inhabitants of the two provinces, whose ancestors voluntarily chose French allegianct were incorporated in Germany against their will.&quot; 4. Readjustment of the Northern Frontiers of Italy as nearly as possible alon the lines of nationality; the Eastern and Adriatic frontiers to be determined i accordance with the principles embodied in the Italo-Jugo-Slav Agreement ant ratified by the Rome Congress of April, 1918.&quot;5. The assurance to all the peoples of Austria-Hungary of their place among! the free nations of the world and of their right to enter into union with their kindre beyond the present boundaries of Austria-Hungary.  This involves the creation (
independent Czecho-Slovak and Jugo-Slav States, the reduction of Hungary to the ethnographic limits of the Magyar race, and the union of all Rumanians with the present kingdom of Rumania. In the same way the Poles and Ukrainians of the Dual Monarchy must be free to unite with their co-nationals across existing frontiers, and it is obvious that the same right of self-determination cannot be denied to the German provinces of Austria, should they desire to enter Germany as a federal unit.&quot; 6. The evacuation of all territory formerly included in the boundaries of the Russian Empire ; the annulment of all Russian treaties, contracts, or agreements made with subjects, agents, or representatives of Enemy Powers since the Revolution and affecting territory or interests formerly Russian ; and the unimpeded co-operation of the Associated Powers in securing conditions under which the various nationalities of the former Empire of Russia shall determine their own forms of government.&quot; When Russia offered a peace of reconciliation without annexations or indemnities, the Central Powers, taking advantage of the military position, rejected all considerations of justice and imposed terms that were brutal and selfish. Thus they forfeited the right to aid Russia and the various nationalities of the former Empire of Russia in their efforts to establish self-determination and their own form of government.&quot; The seventh indisputable principle concerns (a) the formation of an independent Polish State with access to the sea, which State shall include the territories inhabited by predominantly Polish populations; and (b) the indemnification of Poland by the Powers responsible for the havoc wrought.&quot; This condition is indispensable for the reign of justice in Europe. Germany has ruthlessly oppressed the Poles within her Empire. Justice and stability demand the restoration of the predominantly Polish parts of the present German Empire to the new Polish State.&quot;8. The abrogation of the Treaty of Bukarest ; the evacuation and restoration of Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro ; the Associated Powers to aid the Balkan States in settling finally the Balkan question on an equitable basis.&quot; The Balkan question must be settled, and it follows from that principle of self-determination to which the Associated Powers adhere that the Balkan States must be encouraged to agree among themselves and given what advice or assistance they may ask in coming to an agreement.&quot;9. The removal, as far as is practicable, of Turkish dominion over all non-Turkish peoples.&quot;The complexity of the distribution of nationalities in the present limpire of Turkey makes the details of the problem difficult, but the failure of the Turks, in act and in intention, to rule justly has been so disastrous, and the acquiescence of the Central Powers in Turkish misdeeds so complete, that no departure from this principle can be considered.&quot;10. The people of Schleswig to be free to determine their own allegiance.&quot; The case of Schleswig is a fundamental instance of the fashion in which Prussia and Austria used their might to override the principle of self-determination. The wrong done must be redressed.&quot;11. As reparation for the illegal submarine warfare waged by Germany and Austria-Hungary, these Powers shall be held liable to replace the merchant tonnage, belonging to $he associated and neutral nations, illegally damaged or destroyed.&quot; In spite of repeated warnings, and in defiance of the pledges which they had given to the Government of the United States then a neutral Power, the Central Powers have persisted in operations which, by their nature and by the fashion in which they were conducted, outraged both International Law and common humanity.   The
question of punishment must be dealt with separately; that of restoring the ships or their equivalents, and of material compensation to the victims and their families, cannot be subject to discussion or negotiation. .&quot;12. The appointment of tribunals before which there shall be brought for impartial justice as soon as possible individuals of any of the belligerents accused of offences against the laws of war or of humanity.&quot; While I regard this condition as an essential preliminary to peace, as a just concession to the outraged conscience of humanity, I admit freely that its practical application is full of difficulty. I foresee the extraordinary difficulty of assigning responsibility; I recognize that during the actual conduct of war there are reasons why belligerents should hesitate to punish adequately those whom in normal times they would unhesitatingly condemn. I offer my own solution of the difficulty. It isl that the appointed tribunals should act as Courts of First Instance. They wouldl hear the evidence brought against the accused, and, if they found a prima facie case established against them, would refer them to their own countries for ultimate trial, judgment, and sentence. I believe that more stern justice will be done if nations! which desire to purge themselves condemn their own criminals then if the punishment! were left to other nations which might hesitate to be severe lest they should invest!J the individuals punished with the halo of martyrdom.&quot;13. The former colonial possessions of Germany, lost by her in consequence of her illegal aggression against Belgium, shall in no case be returned to Germany.&quot; &quot; Germany&apos;s possession of her colonies would have been inviolate but for her illega aggression against Belgium, which brought England into the war. She has proclaimee that the fate of her colonies would be decided on the Western front, it has been so decided. She has proclaimed the uses to which, if victorious, she would have put her colonies ; such uses must be prevented for ever in the interest of the peace of the world Furthermore, there is this consideration, that, after what has happened, it would be a; intolerable for Australasia to have New Guinea in German hands as it would be foil the United States to have Germany in possession of Cuba. The colonies, therefore, cannot be returned to Germany, but their assignment as possessions, or in trusteeship, together with the fashion in which they shall be administered in the interests of thei.j inhabitants and of the world generally, are matters for future decision.&quot; These are the indisputable conditions of peace which must be accepted in the second stage of the negotiations.&quot; I have dealt with the first two stages as logically separate and successive, actual fact agreement on them might be coincident in time. In any event, acceptance of the. indisputable conditions would be made before the guarantees required undei the terms of surrender or of armistice had become accomplished facts.&quot; The conclusions of the first two stages, whether concurrent or consecutive! will be the end of dictation. They form the preliminary to co-operation. They wif be an earnest of a complete break with the past on the part of Germany. They will gl far to satisfy the natural desire of those who demand that the guilty should bi punished, and yet I believe that they contain nothing that is not imperative for a jusl and lasting peace. And I hope that their imposition and acceptance will, in till subsequent stages, make it possible to take advantage, for&apos; the benefit of the world! of those powers of discipline and organisation which Germany has perverted to till great harm of the world. f?III.&quot; The third stage should, I consider, consist in the appointment of a large numbel of Commissions to study and work out the details of the principles which I hav] enumerated. These will report ultimately, some of them quickly, some of them aft
months or years, to the Central Peace Conference. For my part I see no reason why the members of the Commissions, if the principles on which they shall act are settled beforehand, should not be selected chiefly from among those who have the greatest interest in the matters to be settled. I do not see, for instance, why a Commission consisting largely of Poles and Prussians should not be asked to work out the future frontier of Prussia and Poland. This may be thought the suggestion of an idealist. But I claim that in this instance the idealist is the realist. If our goal be lasting peace, then let us give every opportunity for arrangement and mutual accommodation before we resort to compulsion.&quot; So far I have said nothing of the future government of Germany. The Germans assure us that the transformation of autocratic government to responsible government is taking place. I should like to believe them. I am certain that its accomplishment is necessary to Germany itself and to the final attainment of a just and lasting peace. I frankly admit that the perfect form of government does not exist, and that the genius of Germany may evolve some form as good as, or even better than, existing constitutions.&quot; But Germany must understand that it will take time to convince the world, which has so much reason to distrust her, that this sudden change is to be a permanent reality. Fortunately the stages which I have described do not require for their accomplishment more than the hope that Germany has set out on the right path. Whilst the last stage is in progress there will be time, and more than time, to see whether Germany realises our hopes and what I believe to be now the wishes of the majority of her own people.&quot; For this last stage will mean nothing less than reconstructing the organisation of the world, and establishing a new policy in which a League of Free Nations shall replace the old system of the balance of rival Powers.&quot; The accomplishment of a change so gigantic as the adjusting of national organisations to fit into new super-national machinery must be difficult and slow. Fortunately the very steps that will be necessary to make it possible are steps that will slowly make it actual. Let me select a few simple examples. The cessation of hostilities will leave the world short of food, short of transport, short of raw materials. The machinery that has regulated these during the war will have to be kept in action beyond the war. Food will have to be rationed, transports will have to be rationed, raw materials will have to be rationed. It is a world problem that can be settled only on a world basis, and there will be every opportunity in the years of transition, to transform those economic relations which are forced upon us by necessity into a system which will meet with free and general acceptance.&quot; Intimately connected with these matters will be the problem of the returned soldier, whether wounded or otherwise, the problem of pensions, the problem of wages, housing, hours and conditions of work, regulation of child labour, female labour, and so forth. The equalisation of those in different countries will be necessary to fair rationing, and from this necessity will arise international conferences of workers which may be able to settle some of the most difficult questions of super-national organisa-tion. When the question of disarmament arises, some will demand as a fundamental necessity that their nation must have a large army or a large navy. Some will advocate, as an act of punishment or of justice, the disarmament of other nations. In the consequent negotiations it will soon be found that to insist on an unduly large army or navy is to saddle one&apos;s country with a huge expense ; to insist on the disarmament of another country may be to present that country with a huge annual income that can be used in commercial rivalry. And so we may come to a condition in which, if there be international security, there will be a contest, not as to which country shall maintain the largest navy and the largest army, but as to which country shall most completely disarm.
Lord Northcliffe sent the following valedictory letter dated November 15th, to each of th members:BRITISH WAR MISSION.Crewe House,Curzon Street, London, W.&quot; Sir,&quot;I am sending you herewith a copy of the minutes of the last meeting of t Policy Committee, and feel that it is unnecessary under the changed circumstance to call another meeting.&quot; May I remind you that this Committee was formed under my Chairmanshi by the British War Mission at a time when it seemed urgent to correlate propagand addressed to the enemy to Allies and to Neutrals. In the opening remarks by t Chairman at the first meeting it was pointed out that as the war approached its ene war propaganda would change into peace propaganda. This change took place wii even greater rapidity than was at the moment anticipated, and the Committee hae at once to undertake the task of devising a propaganda policy with regard to peace You are acquainted with the steps that the Committee took and with the large measun of success that their efforts achieved. All questions of policy have now, however passed from the hands of the Committee to those of the Council of the Nations, aw there seems to me no immediate sphere for our action, especially as by arrangemeni with the Government the British War Mission is being wound up.&quot; May I take this opportunity of thanking you for your co-operation, and of statin my belief that had the war continued, the Policy Committee would have develope into an organ of ever-increasing value.&quot; Yours very truly,(Signed) &apos;* NORTHCLIFFE,r: jo&quot; I foresee international Commissions at work for a long time, trying to establisf frontiers, conditions of Parliamentary responsibility, canons of international law, rules of international commerce, laws even of religious freedom, and a thousand othei conditions of national organisation. In the very act of seeking the foundation for League of Free Nations and in slowly building up the fabric, we shall get rid of the ^ passions and fears of war. By the mere endeavour to find the way to a better condition of the world, we shall bring this better condition about.&quot;This article was, as it were, the coping-stone upon the work of Propaganda among the enemy It was published by German newspapers and widely discussed throughout Germany. Certain!) it had effect in helping to form the state of mind which caused the complete collapse of German resistance. While the terms were considered severe, the hope was welcomed that, when these terms had been fulfilled, Germany would be admitted again to the community of nations. Th article gave rise to a great deal of comment at Home also, and did much to form a public opinioi favourable to the conditions of peace which were in the minds of Allied statesmen but whicl they had themselves refrained from declaring in public.Thus the Policy Committee, although it existed so short a time, had useful achievemen to look back upon. Also its constitution had created a valuable precedent which will doubtles not be lost sight of.
101nylaiisi CONCLUSION.!^e&apos; After the result of these labours had appeared, the work of the British War Mission (of xei /hich body the Enemy Propaganda Committee formed part) was drawing to a close. During x 3he last days it was carried on with intensive energy, but on November 9th, the following letter fyas received from the War Office :Sir,&quot; I am commanded by the Army Council to inform you that, in view of the armistices which have been concluded with Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria, the Councilnb has decided that the distribution of propaganda in those Countries by Military meansHi ioi Lie-en les1thiceshould cease during the period of the armistice, esj &quot; I am to say that, in the event of the conclusion of an armistice with Germany,distribution of propaganda by Military means in that country will also cease during the existence of the armistice.&quot; I am further to inform you that the Commanders-in-Chief in the various theatres of war have been notified in the above sense.&quot; I am, Sir,&quot; The Secretary, &quot; Your obedient servant,&quot; The British War Mission, &quot; B. B. CUBITT.&quot;&quot; Crewe House.&quot; th!On the day following the signing of the Armistice, Lord Northcliffe wrote to the Prime [inister:&quot; Dear Prime Minister,&quot; The signing of the last armistice with our enemies has necessarily brought the labours upon which I have been engaged for the past year to a close. The very nature of the armistices themselves necessitates the termination of enemy propaganda, and I beg, therefore, to request you to accept my resignation of my post as Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries.&quot; I wish to thank you for the confidence you have reposed in me in appointing hij me to this office.   I have endeavoured, with the assistance of a most able CommitteenA and of an untiring staff of experts, to render the very best possible services to thethj Government and to the country.sncj &quot; Believe me, dear Prime Minister,dtf &quot; Yours sincerely,haj &apos; &quot; NORTHCLIFFE.&quot;iCi   In reply the Prime Minister wrote on the same clay :UU        &quot; My dear Northcliffe,&quot; I have received your letter, and I agree with you that the office of Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries is rendered unnecessary by recent events.&quot; In accepting your resignation, I wish to assure you how grateful I am for the great services you have rendered to the Allied Cause while holding this important post.
