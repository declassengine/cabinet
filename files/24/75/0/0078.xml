CONFIDENTIAL.[February 14, 1919.]THE INNER CHANGE IN GERMANYPolitical Intelligence Department,Foreign Office, Germany/035.II.Incoherence and Instability of the New Parties.ALTHOUGH the Social Democrat party has not secured an absolute]majority, either in the elections to the National Assembly or in those to the Prussian Diet, it has come out in both cases as the strongest single party. Its strength, however, is apparently not numerical only. It has the advantage of a political programme more definite than that of any other of the new parties. In the case of the other parties one has the impression of a bewildered groping. The German people in the old Obrigheitsstaat had been so accustomed to have the policy of the State made for it by the higher authority that when it is suddenly called upon in the new Volksstaat to frame policies for itself, and to do so in circumstances so new and so frightful as the present, some confusion and helplessness are the natural result.&quot; Everything depends on whether the bourgeoisie .... can rouse itself out of its lethargy to a real class-consciousness. Hitherto it has practically had no class-consciousness which could be set against that of the working class. Nothing exhibits this deficiency more clearly than the fact that in the elections innumer-able members of the bourgeoisie gave their support to Social Democrat candidates, whilst the reverse case, of a Social Democrat ranging himself par depit with the bourgeoisie, seems almost unthinkable. It ought to have been easy for the bourgeoisie to attach the higher strata of the working class firmly to their side, but they lacked any body of ideas with attractive force, which eould counteract the immense suggestive power of Socialism. The bourgeoisie had trusted too implicitly to the strong arm of the State, which had, indeed, done all it could to prevent Social Democracy from encroaching upon the mass of officials and employes dependent upon itself. Now the prop of the old Obrigkeitsstaat (Authority State) has been knocked from under the bourgeoisie; it is thrown back upon its own intrinsic values, and has to prove that there are fruitful and creative ideas amongst its assets. Unquestionably a political pro-gramme might be constructed on the principle opposed to that of Socialism the principle of Individualism which need not for that renounce all fertilising contact with the Socialist body of ideas. Such a programme might almost rival Socialism in attractiveness. Not in vain does the poet seek the greatest happiness possible for the children of men in the free development of personality !&quot; Unhappily, one can hitherto discover precious little (blutwenig) of a specifically bourgeois body of ideas in the programmes of the newly constituted bourgeois parties. Repudiation and criticism of the Socialist programme there is in plenty, but no bourgeois party has so far risen to the task of constructing, onthe basis of a definite principle, a positive programme of its own.....All in allthe bourgeois parties exhibit the same phenomenon of distraction (Zerfahrenheit) and confusion as before the revolution.   Indeed, fundamentally, the confusion has become worse confounded, since the great mass of the people feel at a loss with ;     the new party names and the new programmes.&quot;(Friedrich Thimme, late Librarian of the Prussian Herrenhaus, in &quot; Deutsche Politik &quot; for. 3rd January, pp. 10, 11.)&quot; It becomes increasingly plainer that all the parties, as now constituted, have a merely provisional character. Each bit of party organisation which came to hand was taken, and some name or cither stuck on to the facade of the rudely constructed house.&quot;(Professor Fritz Hartung, of Halle, &quot; Das Neue Deutschland &quot; for 1st January,p. 13*.) [752]-165B
&quot;The time for constructing parties lias not yet come. Perhaps one would be right in saying that it has passed by, since no one can say how things are going todevelop.....   The parties which have now been formed still stand on the oldground. They presuppose Parliaments like the old Reichstag, which offered so favourable a held to the parties just because it afforded comparatively little opportunity for positive work. The parties could have their fling there (austoben) and the orators made speeches against each other, without any real significance attaching to it all. When all was said and done, they had no influence upon policy ; policy was made by quite another set of men in the old Obrigkeitsstaat.&apos;&apos;1(Dr. Joachin von Billow, &quot; Das Neue Deutschland &quot; for 1st January, p. 137.)It is especially the remains of the old Conservative parties now lumped together in the new Beutschnationale Volkspartei which show inner incongruities. P2-ofessor Fritz Hartung, who had belonged before the revolution to the Freikonservative Partei, writes: &quot; The old constitution of the Realm is gone for ever (fiir immer erledigt). I personally, at any rate, cannot believe that a restoration of the monarchy is possible. A restored monarchy would not stand in a position of independence above the parties, as a monarchy must do, if it is to be more than ornamental. Above all, it would have, lost its nimbus in ceasing to be a matter of course. The disgraceful weakness with which our dynasties deserted their posts, as if their princely rights did not imply, as the correlative, princely duties to their country, was a severe shock to the monarchic sentiments of large numbers of people. Many, too, of those who are led by rational considerations rather than by feelings, and who had up to that time advocated with all their power a strong monarchy, because they saw therein the best guarantee of a strong State, have been gradually alienated from the idea, since they could not but see that the great States of the West, with their democratic forms of Government, displayed a much mightier energy than our German Empire, whose semi-absolute Government, as it was accounted, was capable neither of following one consistent policy, nor of mastering its opponents at home.....&quot; If we are to avert the threatened danger of a break-up of our whole political system, we must conserve whatever in the old order has vitality.&quot;(&quot; Das Neue Deutschland &quot; for 15th December, pp. 114-116.)&quot; It was the Conservative parties which under the old regime fought more than any others against new views (Umlernen) .... And now we suddenly find that the very things which the Conservative parties ought to have accepted years ago, the very things which we often put forward as the minimum requisite, have been comprised in the programme of the Deutschnationale Volkspartei! . . . . The Conservative parties would not listen, while there was still time.   Now theypublish this programme   when it is too late.....The DeutschndtionaleVolkspartei, if it is to get the votes of the people who organically belong to it, must put up new men as candidates. But it must also change its programme, since this programme seems to us, apart from its string of empty generalities, extremely unhappy, in so far as it says nothing definite about the form of the State. No one will believe that the&apos; men of the Deutsclinationale Partei do not desire a monarchic system. Why do they not say so frankly and honestly in their programme ? . . . . I and with me many other Conservatives of an open mind  have no scruple in acknowledging that I hold monarchy to be the most serviceable form of State, not on sentimental grounds, but from purely practical considerations. .... But we do not stand out stiffly for the idea of a monarchy; we are ready to accept any form of government which has the great majority of the people behind it. We shall, therefore, recognise the Republic, just as hitherto the republicans in the German Empire gave practical support to the monarchy.....&quot;(Dr Joachim von Billow, &quot; Das Neue Deutschland &quot;for the 1st January, pp. 136, 137.)&quot; The whole energy of the Free Conservative party is apparently directed to gathering together into a single whole all existing fragments of Conservative parties just as in its day the Deutsche Fraktion in the Reichstag was formed out of a number of heterogeneous fragments, without such a formation having any
chance of real vitality.   That this new aggregate has given itself the name ofDeutschnationale Voikspartei makes no difference.....&quot; There is no object in uniting the old groups till we have got some firm ground for them to stand on.   What is it that we want to &apos; conserve&apos; ?   Theold State is dead past recall.....Dead above all that at any rate is myconviction is the monarchy. I have been hitherto a faithful adherent of the monarchy. I may supplement in this place what I said about the monarchy in my article in the last number by pointing to the unworthy conduct of the persons chiefly concerned-the flight of the^ Kaiser and the Crown Prince, their procrastination in publicly renouncing their crowns, above all else their pitifully confessed fear of responsibility in their last utterances to newspaper correspondents. .... There may be people whose opinion on this matter [monarchy] differs from mine. But it is a matter to which every one must give thought, and any one who to-day aspires to have any voice in politics, must have the courage to say plainly what attitude he takes upon so important a question. In the manifestoes of the Deutschnationale Partei, so far as my knowledge goes, this clearness of attitude is wanting. Is this the way to create a tenable basis for a Conservative party ? To what purpose is it to attempt a combination of incompatibles, which is bound to fall asunder in the National Assembly, if not before? . . . .&quot;(Professor Fritz Hartung, &quot;Das Neue Deutschland &quot; for 1st January, p. 138.)In the same number of &quot; Das Neue Deutschland &quot; the leader of the Free Conserva-ive party, Freiherr von Zedlitz und Neukirch, explains his view of the case : &quot;It is especially the parties to the right of the National Liberals which are split up into a number of small groups. Side by side with the two Conservative parties, we find Christian Socialists, anti-Semites of the most various complexions, and others beside. Already in the Reichstag, in order to make effective action possible for them, a considerable part of these groups had to be amalgamated with the Reichspartei to form the Deutsche Fraktion. Just so now, it was imperative to organise all these party groups and grouplets as a single, battle-front, if the sections of the population towards the Right were to bring their strength effectively to bear in the elections. . . .&quot;With regard to the criticism that the statement of principles put out by the jerman-National People&apos;s Party left its attitude on the question of monarchy obscure, ran Zedlitz writes: &quot;In the Outlines of Policy there is no express declaration of adherence to the Republic. Numerous sections towards the Right even to-day still hold firmly in principle to the monarchic standpoint, and cleave with inveterate fidelity to the house of Hohenzollern. They are all ready to adjust themselves to accomplished facts, but it would have made it extremely difficult for them to co-operate if they had been required to abjure their monarchic sentiments by an express declaration.&quot;In the circumstances it is not surprising to find Thimme writing: &quot; The union of the parties to the Right in the Deutschnationale Voikspartei is only apparent. Neither has the Conservative, nor the Free Conservative, party given up its former organisation, and it is already clear to-day that the new aggregate will have no permanence.&quot;(&quot;Deutsche Politik&quot; for 3rd January, p. 11).^1   All the new parties other than the Deutschnationale expressly declare their herence to a republican form of government.   Such monarchists as still exist have ten refuge in the Deutschnationale party, whose attitude, as has just been shown, on e question of monarchy is ambiguous.   Since in the elections to the National Assembly is party gained only 39 seats out of 421, and in the elections to the Prussian Diet ily 48 seats out of 401, it would appear that those who still profess monarchic rinciples form only a small fraction of the German people to-day, and still fewer ould be those who still adhere to the fallen dynasties.   It seems certain that if ything like public order continues to be maintained in Germany, a restoration of the jt onarchy is out of the question.   Of course, if Germany fell into anarchy, no forecast iy )uld be possible ; out of chaos a new monarchy might as well come as anything else. [752]- -165 B 2tore
$ 2. Socialists and Bourgeois Democrats.It would seem that the Ebert Socialists, who are both the largest party and the party with the clearest programme, will direct the course of the new German State. To a large extent their views coincide with those of the Dembkratische Partei, with whom they will no doubt form a coalition. On certain points there is antagonism, to wh h ;&apos; Vorwarts&quot; likes occasionally to call attention, in order to show that the Soc L Democrat party has not lost its character, and become identical with a bourgeois Radical party. The Demokratische Partei looks askance at schemes for substituting nationalised industry for the freedom of individual initiative ; since, however, the Social Democrat party itself insists, as against the Spartacists, that the nationalisation of industry can be brought about only by a gradual and tentative process, it seem^. likely that the vaguer and weaker programme of the Demokratische Partei will be adapted in practice to the programme of the Social Democrats.One point on which the views of the Socialists and those of the bourgeois Democrats conflict is the agrarian question (Landwirtschaft). The Social Democrats-this at any rate is &quot;the predominant view in the party hold with Marx that the same law which in industry made concentration in big concerns (Gfossbetrieb) more profitable economically than small separate businesses applies also to agriculture. They wish agriculture to be carried out by the State on a large scale. The Demokratische Partei, on the other hand, insists that Marx had no practical knowledge 01 farming, and that in agriculture the most profitable mode of cultivation is by numerous small peasant proprietors (kleine Bauernwirtschaft). They want the big landed estates broken up into small parcels for &quot;interior colonisation.&quot;(See an article by Eugen Katz, Sozialismus und Landwirtschaft, in &quot; Deutsche Politik &quot; for 13th December : an article by Dr. Fritz Helversen, Unsere Stellung zur Landfrage, in &quot; Das Demokratische Deutschland &quot; for 14th December. It may be noted that in this matter Dr. Eduard David has strongly opposed his party.)It is asserted that in the interval between the Revolution of 8th November and the elections to the National Assembly, the bourgeois Radicals had grown in strength as against the Social Democrat party. &quot; If the elections had taken place immediately after the Revolution, the Social Democrats might easily have obtained a majority over all other parties put together.&quot; (Rohrbach in &quot;Die Hilfe &quot; for 16th January, p. 28.) Two reasons are given for the Socialists losing ground. One reason is that the outbreaks of anarchy had created wide-spread alarm and the Socialist Government was thought to have shown weakness in the way it dealt with them. Another is the &quot;mass-instinct, the instinct of the middle way.&quot; The Demokratische Partei seemed to offer the safe middle way between the reactionary Deutschnationale and the Socialists, and thousands, who were incapable of political thought and had no real democratic convictions, gravitated to it for this reason. (R. Ochab, Massenpsyche und Democratic, in &quot; Die Hilfe &quot; for 16th January.)I 3. Principles of the Old Regime renounced.&quot; The belief in Force (der Glaube an die Macht) has suffered shipwreck and dragged Germany down with it into the depths. It was a part of that system which, whilst it gave the people a sham self-government, sought in reality to perpetuate enlightened despotism (der aufgeklarien Absolutismus). This system had for long formed part of a decaying world-order and has now lost for ever all basis and substance even in Germany. As one of the last great nations, Germany enters the series of peoples which determine their own destiny. &apos; A new Realm (Reich) will come into being, and therein a new faith will prevail.&quot;This is the conclusion of an article by Dr. Eugeh Foehr, which appears in the number of Rohrbach&apos;s weekly, &quot; Deutsche Politik,&quot; for 10th January. Rohrbach was a little while ago the main &quot;champion of the Berlin-to-Bagdad scheme, and he still fiercely inveighs against the tendency to attribute any predominant guilt for the war to Germany. The fact that such an article as Dr. Foehr&apos;s appears in his organ illustrates the point insisted upon in a previous memorandum-that even where there is no willingness to allow Germany&apos;s peculiar guilt, there is a repudiation of the principles of the old regime and continual asseverations that the new Germany is going to be guided bv quite different principles.&quot;l)as Neue Deutschland,&quot; the fortnightly paper edited by Dr. Adolf Grabowsky, comes much nearer to admitting Germany&apos;s special guilt.   Grabowsky is among the
younger German publicist? of some distinction; lie edited in 1917 the book &quot;Die Zukunft der Deutschen Kolonien,&quot; to which Soil&apos; contributed. In his paper we find it written: &quot;No phrase is so much abused to-day as that about the bird &apos; fouling its own nest.&apos; All attempts to discover inveterate evils or effect thorough fumigation people try to squash by this foolish phrase. He who fumigates, as is well known, does not foul his nest; he cleanses it.....&quot; There is another phrase which one hears almost equally often falsely applied -that &apos; we ought not to look at the world through foreign spectacles.&apos; One ought not indeed to look at the world through foreign spectacles exclusively. But anyone Avho does not occasionally shift bis eye to another point of view than his ordinary one. becomes (lull and stupid. The most important judgments of foreign newspapers on the German mind and German policy ought to appear as a standing feature in all the larger German newspapers.&quot;(&quot; Das Neue Deutschland &quot; for 1st January, pp. 139, 140.)With regard to Czernin&apos;s apology, &quot; Das Neue Deutschland &quot; writes : &quot; Czernin exhibits admirably the essential root of all our troubles-the unlimited domination of the military element in Germany over the statesmen .... Why did the German people sanction it, why did the press endorse it, including even a considerable section of the Social Democrat papers V It was this which enabled Ludendorff, the small imitator of the great Napoleon, to give rein unchecked to his megalomania, without any thought how far the inner strength of Germany and its allies would bear. At that time Ludendorff was acclaimed; to-day the oldest beldame carries her faggot to his stake. More than paltry, after the business has gone wrong ! . . . .&quot; Yes, this hierarchy was firmly supported that was the sum of our misfortune   by the great majority of the nation, especially by the German bourgeoisie, right up to the Revolution. It was necessary that a revolution should come  that is the terrible tragedy of it before this disastrous state of things could be fundamentally altered. Ludendorff was Germany it is no good now trying to blur that fact.&quot;(15th December, p. 119.)In the same number of the periodical appears an article from Dr. Karl Auer, Pastor in Charlottenburg, who published a little book about a year ago, wdiilst the people still hoped to win the war, to protest against Pan-Germanism in the name of Christianity.&quot; The wave of enthusiasm ebbed as more and more people came to see that our military autocrats were not carrying on a purely defensive war, that they had Imperialist aims in view, that the whole truth about the situation was not told &quot; us, and free speech muzzled to an extent beyond what a state of war required. Once again the Church was offered a great opportunity .... What did the Church do ? One need not say anything about the excesses of Pan-German pastors, which the anti-clerical papers took such pleasure in registering .... Worse than theBe outbreaks of passion, more or less excusable in times of national exctie-ment, were the systematic efforts to give a fair colour to all the militarist acts of violence, the facile prophecies of a decisive victory close at hand, the fallacious twisting of religious belief which is essentially marked by a sub-mission to God&apos;s will into an uncontrolled national belief in victory ....&quot; Yes, the Church has sinned gravely. So much has been frankly admitted in these pages; wc do not want to palliate anything. Yet truth requires us to add what follows.&quot; The pastors who propagated false views during the war were themselves, no less than the people as a whole, fooled with lies (Belogene und Betrogenc). I reckon myself amongst their number, although I never joined the jingoes and annexationists. But I too believed at the outset that we had been &quot;suddenly assailed&quot; (uberf alien), and I read out at the altar, with deep emotion, the Kaiser&apos;s appeal to the community and then we knelt down in order to declare our innocence before the Eternal and implore His succour. I can find no words strong enough to-day to express my inner revolt at the thought than one of the most sacred hours of my life was based on a fraud.....But was political
blindness, I ask, a sin confined to the theologians ? Was it not an infirmity of the whole people ?   It is not fair to lay upon a single class the guilt whichbelongs to the community.....&quot; The Protestant Church did not entirely lack men who even amid the turmoilof war remembered the words &apos; Blessed are the peacemakers.....&apos;   In October1917, the memorial month of the Reformation, I, together with my Berlin colleagues Nithack-Stahn, Pless, Rittelmeyer, and Wielandt, obtained through a public appeal signatures to the following manifesto : .1 *&quot; &apos; We, German Protestants; conscious of the blessings and the aims which we share with the whole Christian church, hold out in all sincerity the hand of brotherhood to all our fellow-Christians, including those in enemy countries.&quot;&apos; We recognise the deepest causes of this war in the anti-Christian forces which dominate the life of: nations suspicion, deification of force and covetousness ^and we see in a peace of reconcilement and understanding the peace for which it is worth while to strive.&quot; &apos; We regard, as that which more than anything else hinders an honest rapprochement between nations, the disastrous domination of lies and phrases, by which the truth is smothered or distorted, and illusions are propagated, and we call upon all who desire peace, in all countries, to fight with determination against this impediment.&quot;&apos; In view of this terrible war, we feel it a duty laid on our consciences to strive henceforth with the firmest resolution in the name of Christianity, that war may be eliminated from the world as a means of settling differences between nations.&quot; Some 2,000 signatures were obtained. They came from all sections of the people, from the several fronts, as well as from all parts of the Empire. Soldiers, women, and pastors were especially largely represented. Well-known artists, such as the actor Albert Bassermann, and the composer Axel von Fielitz, University professors, such as Walter Goetz of Leipzig, Max Lehmann of Gdttingen, and Martin Rade of Marburg, gave their names. From amongst the signatories there was formed an &apos; Informal Union of the Protestant Friends of Peace.&apos; .... The beginning was promising. Then the further distribution of our manifesto was suppressed by the military authorities. Pastors in Hanover and Wurtemberg followed the example of Berlin with similar manifestoes. Men, too, who were not theologians, but who belonged to our &apos; Informal Union,&apos; raised their voice in various quarters, for instance in the Hanoverian &apos; Deutsche Volkszeitimg.&apos; Pro-professor Rade&apos;s paper, &apos; Die Christliche Welt,&apos; deserves credit for having opened its columns to this incipient Protestant peace movement so far as the paper-market  and the Censor allowed. The theologian Otto Baumgarten in Kiel University conducted a polemic [in 1917] against&quot; the Pan-German danger, and so did my pamphlet &apos; Hammer oder Kreuz&apos; Permission to print a second edition of this pamphlet was granted, though I was compelled to delete a reference to Baum-garten&apos;s monograph about America and the politically dangerous (staats-gejahlichen) appeal of the Berlin pastors ; also export of the pamphlet was forbidden. The verdict of history will pronounce that other voices were heard in the Protestant Church besides those of firebrands and members of the Vaterlands-partei, only the Friends of Peace could not assert themselves effectually, because freedom of action was denied them by the all-powerful militarism.....&quot; The new Church must repudiate war in tli^ name of Christian ethics, and co-operate in the creation of an honest League of Nations which guarantees equal rights to all States ; it must propagate the idea at home and foster relations between the peoples.&quot;In view of such movements as that here revealed, how far is it true to say that in (Germany there is &quot;no shadow of a chinge of heart,&quot; that Germany is still the same old militarist Germany which made the war ?o
