n\ -9 9MS DOHUIBHT, IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GQVgHIDON?.)S E C RE T,3.T. 6896.war CABINET.REAFFORESTATION.Memorandum by Mr. F. D. Aoland,Lord Curzon has asked me to prepare a note for circulation to the Home Affairs Committee in explanation of the draft Forestry Bill.     I have had the bill prepared as part of the work whidh I was asked by the War Cabinet to do in &quot;advising and assisting in &quot;the setting up of a Central Authority&quot;   (War Cabinet &apos;4JJ, Minute 15 - August 7th 1918).     The bill follows the lines of that decision and is consequential upon it except on matters not covered by the decision, as to which I have fallowed the lines of the Report of the Reconstruction Sub-Committee.   It has been approved by the Treasury,    The Bill sets up a Forestry Commission (Clause l) gives it powers and duties (Clause 3) establishes subordinate bodies (GLaus&amp;a 5 and 6) gives It power to acquire land (Clause 7) and funds for ten years work (Clause 8).    Clause 4 is a rabbit&apos;s clause taken from the Corn Production Act.It is necessary to call the Committee1e attention to certain points(l)    Clause 3(2) is the only way that I can devise for giving effect to a minute b$r Lord Cursor) and Mr. Barnes of September 6th which stated that the Cabinet decision involved . &quot;the setting up of separate authorities in eaoh part of the United Kingdom to carry out in the various national areas the policy of the OwlAutbs&amp;liy.   It will be for the, latter when constituted to decide whether it&quot;creates, entirely&quot;ne^1. author it i e 8 for &quot;thi s &quot;purpose,&apos; oT&quot; whe-jh&apos;3r&quot; aucTt a &quot;what ext agt., JJLMfi.ir f. Agricultu.c o..   At &quot;Agriculture for England andutilise the_purpose.agencies of tke zxisting Boar-.:present the President of the Board of wales has handed ever the forestry functions of his department to the Interim Forest Authority, but without prejudice to the general position,     In Scotland an arrangement is in operation under which the officer acting as Assistant Commissioner under the Interim Authority remains a member of the Scottish Board of Agriculture, and in this capacity obtains the approval of the Secretary for Scotland before carrying out tho general policy decided upon by the Authority.This arrangement seems likely to work satisfactorily and the clause if passed would permit it to continue, or permit of any other arrangement for working through the Boards of Agricul-ture, but it gives the Authority power within two years of the passing of the Act to have the powers of the Boards transferred to themselves by Order in Council,(2)   A forestry fund ic established to last the Authority ten years.     It will be administered under regulations laid down by the Treasury and an annual Report and Accounts will be submitted to Parliament, but it is not proposed that there shall be annual estimates.   The nearest existing analogy is that of the Development Commission, ,   The Draftsman of the Bill has suggested for consider-at ion that possibly it would be well to place at least the salaries of the paid Commissioners on the Estimates,
(3)   There will he no Minister for forestry.     It is proposed that the Authority should he represented in the House of Commons by a member of tho Commission in much the same way as the Ecclesiastical and the Charity Commissions are at present.     Ho would presumably have to be on tho Government side of the Houset but he would hot be one of the Commissioners in receipt of a salary.(4)   Ireland is dealt with thus Under the Home RuleAct , forestry is to continue to be aide3&quot;by tho Development Commission. ,   Clause 3 (4.)&apos; of the Bill proposes,to take away the present functions of the Development Commission so far&apos;as forestry is concerned fpp,-England and Wales, but I do not propose that this should be done for iTreiand; an This would involve an amendment of the Home Rule Act., - which appears to be impolitic at the preoent time The Interim Authority has established relations withIreland which are likely to work well in practise, and it may be . that in due time Ireland will prefer to look definitely ami avowedly to the Authority rather than to the Commas ion, but it seems better not to try to force this.( )   The powers which it is proposed to take for the compulsory acquisition of land are those possessed by the Development Commission, through whom the Authority would have to act.     Neither this procedure nor the powers exceroisable under it are satisfactory, but it is the best that can be/done until the Government deal ^comprehensively with the question of the compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes.    When this is done no doubt   the Forestry Commission would be ane of the bodies upon whom powers would be conferred.(Signed) . P. -D.ACLAND.27th February,.1919 -
