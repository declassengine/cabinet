iC^Qii/kNBUM   BY   fJE3m\ cabinet.(PuAiM^Lioi mmiuvTtt m:&amp;s ii householdG3,iErJT ABD DGUiSTIO 8011310With reference to memorandum G.T.6815, it will help to elucidate the present position if I give the history of the vicissitudes of the proposed scheme for the Training of ijomen in Household Kaaa&amp;ement and Domestic Science..1.  A skeleton scheme for the training olN^men munition w6rfeers thrown out of employment by the armistioe was prepared in consultation with the Board of Education and submitted to the Womerifr Trade Union Advisory Committee in Mo vena be r last aad was unanimously approved by that Committee.2.  A. memorandum embodying the terms of the proposed scheme, was prepared and submitted to General Smuts&quot; Demobilisation Committee on 4th December last.   The memorandum was briefly considered by the Standing Sub-Committee on 6th December when further consideration was postponed, Sir James Stevenson expressing disapproval of the proposals.3.   In the light of further information obtained by the Department the scheme was modified in certain details and on the 23rd December a further memorandum was submitted to Sir Brio (Jeddes on the subjeot.,4.   Oh 3rd January 1919 the memorandum tf 23rd December was considered at a meeting of Sir Eric Ueddes&apos; Council when Mr. Barstow expressed the view that the Board of Education should deal with the subject.   It was pointed out at that meeting that the Board of Bducation themselves said that they had not the necessary staff to cope with the work.5.   On 5th January 1919 Sir Eric Geddes.sent a memorandum (G.T.6605) to the War Cabinot together with a copy of the memorandum of 23rd December.   These memoranda wore considered at the meeting of the-War Cabinet on 8th January (War Cabinet 514r, par. 41 when it was decided:-that the question of the training of V/omeG workers should receive further consideration Of the llinistry of labour before a final decision Is given.    ,6.  On the 31st January, as a result of this ruling, the scheme was submitted to the Labour Resettlement Committee for their consideration and&apos;was approved by the Committee with only two dissentients, namely Mr. Short, the representative of the General federation of Trades Unions and the Admiralty representative.7.  On.the 6th February I submitted a further memorandum to the T/ar Cabinet pointing out that the proposals had been endorsed by the ,* labour lie settlement Committee and asking for approval of the scheme;. % This memorandum was considered at a Conferonce of IJinisters held on 13th February, when Sir Auckland Goddes said he proposed to approve forthwith of the soheme being put into operation.   Lord Inchape,&apos; /however.,
however, demurred and asked whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer had given his approval. -Sir  uofcland Geddes decided that the scheme should-proceed:if no objection were raised by 17th instant and that -if the Chancellor withhold his sanction the matter should&apos; again be referred to the War Cabinet, - -8. * The Chancellor of tho Exchequer, now informs me that  the&apos; treasury, considers that the scheme is open tb the gravest objection-s;but that, if necessary, ho will be, prepared tb consider arrangements^ under whioh the local Education Authorities might provide training. -This is precisely what * as I understand the Board of Education-will not agree to as the JDooal Education Authorities havo neither t&amp;?e staff cor the premises to enable thorn to undortako a scheme of this 3dtnd*It is imperative to, get a final aeelsjon on this matter now so -that wo know how we stand.   I am constantly being pressed on the matter by various members of tho Gomj]j&amp;ttoes who have considered tije scheme.(Sgd) R. S. HOOT.-20th February 1919.
