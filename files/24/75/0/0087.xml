Lieutenant-Colonel L. Storr, C.B. (Assistant Secretary, War Cabinet).THE PRIME MINISTER: I will ask Sir Auckland Geddes to start to-days proceedings.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : I have been presiding over a good many conferences recently of representatives of the different Government Departments, all suggesting lines of policy and executive acts, and it appeared to me as we went on that there were four really separate and main lines of thought running through the action or suggested action of the Government Departments. .There is first of all a policy and I do not refer to the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself here for the moment which has been very strongly pressed at many meetings by representatives, that the main interest of the country at the present time was to get back to the gold standard, and to stop every possible form of Government expenditure. We have a policy, which is being very strongly pushed really by the big combination of manufacturers which forms the Federation of British Industries, and that policy is that everything must give way to getting the trade of the country going. We have a third policy, which is represented by the housing scheme, the land settlement scheme, the scheme for ways and communications, and so on. We have got a fourth policy, which is being very strongly urged by at least one Department, and affects the action of others what I might call the Imperial policy, which seeks to regard the Empire as an undivided whole, which compares our position to-day with that of America 60, 70, or 80 years ago [1269] . . B
where there was an industrial nucleus and a great undeveloped territory, and that policy calls for a great mass of emigration within the Empire. There is no doubt that the Government is pledged by every possible election pledge to the social policy. But that carries with it, it seems to me, certain things which I do not think are perhaps fully recognised by all Departments when they put forward recommendations for executive action. There is no doubt that if we are to have this great development of social amenities in the country, improved housing, land settlements health, and all the rest of it, a very great deal of national capital is going to be locked up i j what is going to be a slow-maturing investment. Just so long as that capital is lockecr up will it be unavailable for trade purposes, as it seems to me. I have looked at the thing very carefully, and have looked at all the Reports of Reconstruction Committees, and so on, and I do not find anywhere that what appears to me to be an absolutely essential consequence of adopting that policy recognised.THE PRIME MINISTER: Will you tell me this ? Up to the present you have not pointed out to me in what respect the policies are inconsistent. Is there any reason to believe that trade is not starting because there is a lack of capital ?SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : I think there is a good deal of .reason to believe that trade is not starting because there is a lack of capital that can be made available. I was going on to indicate where it seems to me the clash is coming. In connection with the social policy we have got this locking up of capital, and that appears to me to make it absolutely essential that we -should recognise that the trade position of the country cannot be what it was before the war, and that the country cannot carry the food population which it did carry before. We have had during the last four years by recruitment what is, in so far as its social effects are concerned, really the same as emigration on a great scale. We have had the places of those who have gone filled, and a social reorganisation has taken place which has profoundly modified the whole conditions as they existed in 1914. It seems to me that with this social policy I have looked at it carefully, and I think there is no doubt about it we cannot possibly hope for years to come to carry the food population which this country did carry before, because the development must be slow if we are to get the agricultural development which is necessary to produce the food in this country. It is not going to happen this year or next year; it will be a matter of slow development. The development of the agricultural policy, the production in our own country, seems to me to be essential if we are to carry the population, and for this reason, that the markets of the world are entirely trans-formed, so far as trade is concerned, from what they were before the war. We cannot possibly have the same sort of markets. Central Europe is practically shut out. Our Allies, France, Italy, and so on, are not in a position to pay for goods that they receive from us to a great extent. They owe us amounts of money which it is likely they will never pay for in food, and the trade position cannot go back. Therefore it seems to me that what we have to recognise is that the minute we embark upon this social policy  as we have embarked we have done two things : really we have made it essential that there should be great emigration, and we have also recognised the fact that trade is not going to go back the conditions and the organisation of trade and industry in this country cannot go back to a pre-war state. Take building alone. In my view, what we are doing there is to create a position in which private enterprise, at all events in connection with smaller houses, is politically impossible. We have had houses built during the war at a certain rate, we are going to have houses built now at a perfectly different rate, a much higher rate, perhaps more than twice as high. The rent that is going to be paid for those houses is going to be kept down in the meantime to a level very near what the old economic rent was, but not quite. If it were conceivable that labour was going to give up the high rates of wages, it might be conceived that the cost of building would go down, but I do not think it is conceivable that labour will do that. Therefore I think we may assume that the cost of building is not going back to the old level. If new houses are to be put upon an economic level for their cost of production there will be at once an enormous rise in the rents of the houses built upon the old scales of cost. I do not think there is any chance whatever of that increased return upon the original owner&apos;s capital, regarded as unearned increment, being accepted politically. . I think the result of a sudden jump in building, the change in prices, the change in policy, will be that we have absolutely destroyed the basis upon which our industry particularly in house-building was built up, and it seems to me on this policy we are going straight to the nationalisation of building. It may be a good thing or it may be a bad thing, but it is clearly a great departure from anything that we have had before. It seems to me that we hare got these various things being recommended, pressed, and carried out,
without there being any agreement between the departments and the fundamental ideas that underly their policies. The result is that we have clashed everywhere. We have got the departments responsible for progressive policy naturally clashing with the departments responsible for the trade policy.THE PRIME MINISTER: I read your paper this morning, and I really did not see where the clash came in. How can there be a clash between the Board of Trade and j he Minister of Agriculture?   What clash is there between the Board of Trade and yjhe President of the Local Government Board about housing?   I really do not see it.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES: There is no clash between the President of the Board of Trade, as such.THE PRIME MINISTER: He represents&apos; the second of your items, the restoration of trade in this country. What clash is there between the new departments ?SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES: There is none.MR. BONAR LAW: I think the Prime Ministers first question is, is there any shortage of capital ?   I do not think there is.THE PRIME MINISTER : No doubt businesses are not starting. There is raw material, which is rather high, and they think it is coming down. There is a shortage of orders, and I daresay there is a shortage of capital in France and elsewhere. We have lent them money to give orders there. Do you know of any business which is unable to start here because there is a lack of capital in that particular business ?SIR ALBERT STANLEY : No, there is not. On the contrary, there is an abundance of capital for all the railway demands. It is only that business is nervous. Capital is hiding itself.LORD INVERFORTH : There is want of confidence.THE PRIME MINISTER : Yes, I agree; there is no doubt about that.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : I want to qualify what the President of the Board of Trade says. There is an abundance of capital for that if you do not want capital for anything else, but there is not sufficient capital for all that we want to do.SIR ALBERT STANLEY : It is not true to say there is abundance of capital for the moment for trade. You have to look at the restrictions necessary for the Treasury to maintain, and you have to look at the other requirements for capital.THE PRIME MINISTER : Do you know one business which is not starting now because the man in charge says &quot; I have not the capital to do it&quot; ?SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : You ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer about the businesses which have not been allowed to raise capital.   They have not been allowed    * to raise it because the Treasury wishes to keep up the embargo.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : If you had the Federation of British Industries here, or the National Union of Manufacturers, which represents smaller businesses, they would say to you that there are cases and they would supply you with th^ cases if you pressed for them where the effect of the excess profits duty has been to leave individual firms with insufficient capital for their business or, at any rate, they allege that.THE PRIME MINISTER : Of course they make the best case they can.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : Our cry is &quot; Go to the market and raise more.&quot; If you wanted to do nothing but your own internal trade development, there is capital enough, but there is not capital enough to find for the State the funds it needs to borrow for the war, for the Government reconstruction schemes, and to find all the capital that it would be desirable to have for commercial enterprise at home, and to find the capital which is required for Empire development, either in the old Empire or in new territories of which we may become a mandatory, and to find the capital for general foreign enter-prise which many people wish to do. In these circumstances we have passed our new Order in Council in order, while we relax certain of the restrictions which have been in force, to make those which we preserve really effective, and to secure that such capital as there is shall be allotted to those purposes which best serve the national interest.MR. BONAR LAW : Is not this the fact ? Ultimately there will be a shortage of trade- The difficulty Mr. Chamberlain speaks of is a different one. It is that firms have spent so much in excess profits duty that they have not the courage, with that big burden on them, to go to the public and ask for big sums of money.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : The high value of material comes into the excess profits question.   It is not entirely excess profits.
MR. CHAMBERLAIN : Every business, owing to the rise in prices and wages, wants more working capital. Every business has to incur capital expenditure in trans-ferring itself to its new peace work, or a great number are. What they say is that the 20 per cent, left them under the excess profits duty is an insufficient reserve for those purposes.THE PRIME MINISTER: I agree with Sir Auckland Geddes that if you havJj got trade going strong you would find a shortage, but I do not think it exists at present! Supposing the war had gone on for another year, which is what we contemplated and was very probable, could not we have borrowed the necessary 2,000,000,000L ?   We were spending money freely on public works, so if you create a sort of prosperity there is no doubt you could find the money.LORD ERNLE: There are fewer bills, which shows the money is in the country.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : The money is all in Treasury bills. That is where the money is at the present time.THE. PRIME MINISTER: Let us see what the problem means. Take public works. How much money could you spend this year upon your scheme? Supposing you have your Bill through in three weeks, how much money could you spend this year ?SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : I have no idea.THE PRIME MINISTER: Comparatively little. I want to know why this problem should be such an appalling one for a nation which has been finding 2,000,000,0001   Could you spend-20,000,0001?SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES: Yes.THE PRIME MINISTER : Put it at the maximum.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : You would scatter it all over the country.THE PRIME MINISTER : How much could you spend on housing ?DR. ADDISON: We reckon the total they could get for starting is 50,000,0001. They could not spend it all.THE PRIME MINISTER: How much could you spend?DR. ADDISON: About half that.    As to the public works, which I have scheduled here, the maximum which could be started they would not be finished, of 8    course-is 14,000,0007,THE PRIME MINISTER : Would you spend 7,000,0001. ?DR. ADDISON : I should think about half that.   I could not answer oflhand.MR. ILLINGWORTH : My programme for telephones is 8,000,0001.THE PRIME MINISTER: Would you spend 20,000,000L altogether?MR. ILLINGWORTH : No.THE PRIME MINISTER: 15,000,0001?MR. ILLING WORTH : I should say we would spend I2,000,000L I have cut it down, according to Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s instructions, to an absolute minimum.THE PRIME MINISTER : I am assuming there is great unemployment, and that you have to spend in order to keep things going.   What other department is there ?LORD ERNLE : If building was possible I could spend 15,000,0001.THE PRIME MINISTER : In a year ?LORD ERNLE: Yes.ME. BONAR LAW : That means buying land, does it not ?THE PRIME MINISTER: Land is a question of whether you are having stock -or cash.   That is a different matter from what you spend in building.LORD ERNLE : Not more that 7,000,0001., I should think.THE PRIME MINISTER: That is 7l,000,000i. altogether.
/MR. CHAMBERLAIN : How have I to meet that ? I have 30,000,0001 available for Local Loans Stock, i.e., I have a possible 30,000,0001 by realising securities held on behalf of the Local Loans Fund, and by ceasing to invest repayments to sinking fund&apos;in other Government securities. That leaves me 41,000,0001. short. It would be folly to issue Local Loans Stock at the same time that I am borrowing for the war purposes of the Government. It is very desirable to close down the general borrowing, as I am sure $Mr. Bonar Law will realise, and get on to the Local Loans Stock for reconstruction work as fcoon as we can.ME. BONAR LAW : How are your Bonds coming in now ?MB. CHAMBERLAIN : Very poorly ; perhaps 3,000,000L a week.   We never expected it to come in as it did. ,THE PRIME MINISTER: You are dealing with a very exceptional thing. Following the history of every great war there is always a very trying period. I have been reading an account of what followed the Napoleonic wars. There were great riots and tremendous trouble, the troops were called out, the Lord Chancellor was locked in his house for three or four days and could not get to the Courts, and all sorts of disturbances. I think you will have to consider this year as really almost a war-condition year. You are getting out of the war condition, and I would not be in too great a hurry to get on to the absolute peace basis until you find the nation is actually on that basis.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: We cannot live by taking in one another&apos;s washing. What we want to do is to get a healthy trade started. That is far more important than stocking a great lot oi expensive relief work. If you could get the businesses to move the rest would follow.THE PRIME MINISTER : 71,000,0001. to be raised in the course of a year is not going to stop business. I have heard many reasons given why business has not started. This is the first time I have heard it suggested it is lack of credit, and it is not even approximately accurate. There is plenty of money, and if there were business and confidence on other grounds business would start. I say there is no incompatibility between these two things.MR. BONAR LAW : I should like you to realise the difficulties. I have not the figures, but I always thought we had difficulty in getting the money absolutely necessary for the State during the transition period, for this reason. The money came to us largely from profits made by war industries and such like, and it? came in the form of Treasury bills.   If the industries are slack, how can we get it ?THE PRIME MINISTER : Take the banks.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : I have had it all already, in bonds and Treasury bills. As businesses get active they will not renew their Treasury bills.THE PRIME MINISTER: All I know is this. I always used to hear from Mr. McKenna, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, that we could not borrow beyond the 31st March, and that then there would be an end. Then he brought it up to September.MR. BONAR LAW : There is this difference. I am not saying we cannot raise 71,000,0001. The bulk of the 5,000,000,0001. to 6,000,000,0001 we burrowed has been made out of war profits.DR. ADDISON : On our public works and housing we estimate, on the pre-liminary survey we were asked to get out, that of the 50,000,000L commitments for housing the public authorities could raise 30,000,0001. themselves. It comes out of the same pocket, of course. For public works they could raise 11,000,000^. themselves, and only ask the Treasury to help to the extent of 3,000,0001. on public works loans.THE PRIME MINISTER : They would have no difficulty in raising it.DR. ADDISON: No. 41,000,0001., we reckon, out of our 62,000,000^. the authorities could raise themselves.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : As soon as the people get confidence in value and wages it will start automatically. Those are the only two difficulties in my mind, barring various questions of exchange, which we were discussing yesterday. Of course., this is only one side of it.[1269] - -      C
\MR. CHAMBERLAIN : I think Sir Auckland Geddes would agree that perhaps this point has been stressed unduly.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : Quite. I think it has been proved out, if I may say so. It is only one factor in a large number. The points I wanted to make were these. Are we, or are we not, going to try and get back rapidly to the gold standard basis, because that policy is being urged at the recent Conferences, not in so inanyb words, but in effect, bv the representations that are made ? That is the first thing. I!m) we are going to get rid of the inflation I see enormous social difficulty and political difficulty, The next point is this. Are we going to adopt the sort of policy which is urged by the Federation of British Industries, that their losses on stocks, their losses -on contracts entered into by them before the war, are to be met by the State ?THE PRIME MINISTER: How is that? .SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : Their losses on stocks, which they have paid for at high rates ; are they to be met by the State ? Their losses on contracts, entered into before the war at. pre-war prices, which they have now to fulfil in post-war conditions are those losses to be met by the State ? There are a large number of points, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer knows better than I do, which have been and are being pressed by that body. The next is, are we to recognise what I believe to be the case that this social development programme which is adopted by the Government and to which the Government is absolutely pledged, carries with it, as I am sure it does, the need for organising emigration on a large scale ? This is coming on to the fourth policy, because this country cannot absorb the full mass of people if we are going in for long-range investments on a great scale not only this year, but next year and the year after. Then, if that be recognised, are we also recognising that by going in for this policy at the present moment we are destroying the basis of private enterprise in such an industry as the building industry ? How shall we deal with that situation ? Those are the points upon which we have no policy. There is the general overshadowing money difficulty, and those are all points centring on it and requiring decision. I agree that the amount of money wanted this year can be got, but it is going to have effects, and the effects will vary as we move along certain lines of policy. I wanted to make that point and to get an indication as to what is your general mind and the mind of the Government with regard to the lines of policy on which we are moving.SIR ALBERT STANLEY: I cannot help feeling, from what Sir Auckland has said, that he places much too high a value upon these social improvements, as he calls them, and that he expects more will be done that will be possible in the time. If private people do not build, then the State begins to build. We have to provide houses for the people to live in.THE PRIME MINISTER: That is really the biggest item-building.SIR ALBERT STANLEY : It is only a limited sphere of activity in any event, but it will secure better places for the people to live in, and it does not involve a great deal of money. You get that back in the better work the people will do. Then when you come to electricity, the scheme there is to provide cheaper power. That is all for the development of industry and to make the operation of railways more efficient and make more money. That will hot be done in two or three years; it will take a long time to develop.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : It is a long-range investment.SIR ALBERT STANLEY : No, because the investment itself only takes place over a very long period in small quantities. You cannot take all the power stations of the kingdom and. throw them away and build new ones. A lot of them are all right. It is only in certain places where new stations will be built, and they will produce power at a cheaper figure than the old stations. That is a natural process of development, and you will get the result of that development in greater efficiency in your industries. Take railways I speak with some diffidence, because this is Sir Eric Geddes&apos; depart-ment there, again, the investment he makes in railways will be with the object of securing an immediate return. It is not in the form of a luxury that he is going to spend money. He is not going to build first-class carriages in order to give everybody a coach to themselves. He is going to spend money to make the railways more efficient and cheaper, and to improve our industries.   Those will have an immediate return, and
I am sure I am correct in saying that the money that is to be spent on what are called social improvements will be spent over a. very long period of time.MR. BONAR LAW : I do not think you are dealing with Sir Auckland&apos;s point, which is this. It is a question of trying to get rid of tiie inflation. That seems to me to be the thing. At present, apart altogether from any other consequence, the loss of Siarkets is one thing, and there are our expenses, and in addition to thai;/ the scale of ^/ages ; and, if along with that you want to get back to the gold standard business, it is obvious you cannot do it.   Inflation must be kept up.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : Inflation is absolutely essential. This policy which has been urged of getting rid of it is unsound.   We have to keep inflation.MR. BONAR LAW :  It is a right thing to have as a hope, but that is all.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : It seems to me we have to keep inflation, and we have to realise it.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : Will Mr. Bonar Law develop his idea ? He says it is obvious we shall have to maintain inflation. I think even if we trv to get rid of it we cannot. What happens then ? At the present time we maintain the dollar exchange in New York, as we maintain other exchanges, by artificial means. The Government buys exchange and sells exchange. In other words, it subsidises the importer from, those countries and to some extent penalises the exporters to those countries. If we let the exchange go, import would become more difficult and export would become easier. Does Mr. Bonar Law contemplate that it is the proper policy for us to pursue to let the exchanges go ?   If we do, then of course gold will be shipped.MR! BONAR LAW: That implies two things. If the exchange goes, it means the inflation here is higher than&apos;in America. That is not sound, to begin with. In the second place, whether we like it or not, it is obvious you cannot stop inflation if you have to go on borrowing money ; and you can do nothing else if we are to go on with our policy at all. When we come to the exchange we must do our best to keep it up.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : It becomes increasingly difficult. We have maintained the exchange during the war by money which we have borrowed from America for the purpose. My information, which came from Mr. Norman Davies, who is much more friendly to us than the Treasury in Washington, is that America might lend us money for specific purchases of American products ; but great objections were raised in Congress to supporting the exchange, and America will not lend.money for that purpose.MR. BONAR LAW : That comes down to the same difficulty we were faced with in the war. Supposing there was a possibility of the exchange breaking, it would be more serious for America than for us, because they could not sell. We have always to remember that.(At this point Mr. Churchill joined the Conference.)MR. CHAMBERLAIN : All that comes into it; but I do not think we, as a Government, shall be able to keep the exchange going. We have let the Spanish exchange go, and if certain other proposals are approved we shall have to let others go.MR. BONAR LAW: The situation is a serious one.THE PRIME MINISTER: With an 8,000,000,0001 debt, of course it. is serious.MR. BONAR LAW : I thought we should have a bad time when the war was over, but there is no hope of salvation that we shall get back to the times before the war.LORD INVERFORTH : It will be all right when business is restarted. You want to re-establish confidence.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: That comes back to my point. Social reforms are important as social reforms. I do not question that, and the Prime Minister knows I agree with the policy. They may help the problem of unemployment temporarily, as any relief would do. The really important thing for the safety ot. our position is to get our trade going, and, above all, to get our export trade going, and it is no real compensation for that if we are spending an enormous amount of money on housing, or anything like that.
SIR L. WORTHINGTON EVANS : I would suggest that you should not attempt to hold the exchange beyoud a point. I should gradually let it go, because that would help the export trade.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : That is the worst thing you could do. Let it go all at once if you are going to let it go. The most expensive thing to do is to let it be dropping all the time. v.SIR L. WORTHINGTON EVANS : You will help your export trade if yoQ let it go.SIR ALBERT STANLEY: If you take down the barrier against export trade it will improve it.   You cannot get exports out of the country.THE PRIME MINISTER: Why ?SIR ALBERT STANLEY: Because of the blockade. We have 100,000,000*. worth of business waiting to be done with countries affected by the blockade, and we cannot move it.THE PRIME MINISTER: What sort of things are they ?SIR ALBERT STANLEY: All sorts of manufactured things and semi-roanu-factured things for Holland and the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, and the countries adjacent to the enemy countries. They hold us up because they say these things would drift into Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER: What sort of things would drift into Germany ?SIR ALBERT STANLEY : I do not know of anything, but other people argue to the contrary.   They say you must have this tremendous grip on Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER : Is it machinery, for instance?SIR L. WORTHINGTON EVANS : No. In my time it was limited to things which were potential munitions and cotton. I do not know how far it has gone. I should have thought it has been reduced since my time. It would apply to textiles largely, perhaps. The time must be approaching when it cannot be necessary to keep the blockade going.MR. MUNRO : What happened about textiles for the Balkans ?SIR ALBERT STANLEY : All these export restrictions are at the moment under a fresh review, and they will come off in large numbers. We are getting rid of a great many of them.MR. MUNRO : We began a review of them in November. SIR ALBERT STANLEY : We began again last week. MR. MUNRO : I should take a big blue pencil.SIR ALBERT STANLEY: We did in November reduce the list by a third, at any rate.COLONEL AMERY : Might I come back to the point Sir Auckland Geddes raised about emigration ? He said that, owing to the immense number of people who went out, and the length of time they have been abroad, the war has been in its social effect an enormous emigration. It has lasted so long, and things have transformed them-selves so much at home that I do not believe you can get all the war emigrants back into this country any more than you can put Australia back into this country. The army includes hundreds of thousands of men who would have emigrated but for the war, and others whose attitude has changed, who, if they come back, will be restless, and will want to go. I think it is essential that they should not be discontented by having no machinery for seeing that when they do go they go to the right places and that there are arrangements for receiving them at the other end. I mention that because I think it is of tremendous importance that before they all come back and want to start off again, as they are bound to do, they should find the machinery ready and will not be rushing off to cities like Montreal and other cities which they would congest, and create a lasting feeling against emigrants at the other end.There is this also. Not only has ldustry transformed itself completely in a period of reduced industrial population, owing to war emigration, but this has taken place under non-competitive conditions. There has been no question of price in competing markets with other countries.   We ar.3 now on a different industrial basis, and I believe
that, apart from the immediate requirements of neutral markets at this moment which the rising of the blockade might enable us to fulfil, you will find a little later that the old market for British industry on the Continent and in neutral countries no longer exists. Those countries, for their own reasons, will restrict their imports. France is doing so now, and Germany will have to do so in order to keep up the exchange. We are in fact *io longer the sort of country that can compete industrially in the open market except in aiertain industries. We are more in the position the American industries were a genera-*tion ago, capable of doing tremendous things in our own area where we compete with our own kind of conditions, but not capable of competing in the open market. It really comes to this, that we can both carry out our social reform and develop an immense trade, but mainly if not almost entirely within the Empire. That hangs together with the emigration question in this sense, that every man who goes out to other parts of the Empire not only creates trade in equipping himself, but becomes a new source of trade and development when he has arrived there. Apart from the immediate question of capital, and whether you can ease the trade situation by opening the blockade, I do believe over a longer period of years, the only chance of keeping up the population and the prosperity of this country is by developing the population of the Empire outside as rapidly as we can. The immediate thing is that we must not have an appalling congestion of people in this country, who want to emigrate and cannot find the proper conditions to do so.THE PRIME MINISTER : Have you a scheme prepared in the Colonial Office XCOLONEL AMERY : Yes, we have had an Emigration Committee, and the question was to have come up yesterday before the Cabinet. We have a Bill for machinery, and definite projects as to dealing with the ex-soldier, who is going to be the chief factor in emigration, because he is the man who would have gone if there had not been a war, the type of man who will be unsettled if his place has been, taken, the man who has mixed with colonial soldiers. Just as after the American Civil War the whole development of the American West was done by the veterans of the Civil War they made the West in exactly the same way the veterans of this war are not going to rest content with staying in England. The only question is, are you going to make their diffusion an easy and even process, to enable them to go with arrangements made for them, and not create congestion at the other end as well as here? I do strongly ask the Cabinet to allow us to introduce the proper machinery, because we cannot possibly go to High Commissioners and Agents-General and begin any sort of negotiations without machinery or even an outline of what the Government are prepared to do for the ex-service men. If the Government would let me introduce a Bill and get the machinery started, and if the Government will endorse the moderate Conservative policy put forward by the Emigration Committee, I could get in touch and find out what the Canadians would do for us, what Australia and each State of Australia would do for us, and so on, and we should be ready when the ugly rush comes, and we should be able to say &quot; Yes, this is all right, we can send so many here, and so many there.&quot; The thing would proceed, evenly, and you would not have the Bolshevism and the very real trouble you will have if you are not prepared to cope with this period of congestion which must come. I entirely agree with Sir Auckland on that point.Public social works, taking off the blockade, and such-like remedies should ease the situation for some months to come. But I am sure a period is coming within six months, and will last for two or three years, when you will find England cannot reabsorb the men who emigrated for the war, unless it is prepared to come back to the pre-war wages and pre-war conditions of labour; in fact, we should have to be the old European competitive England instead of what it is now, an England almost on the American basis of high wages.THE PRIME MINISTER: Europe is not the old continent either, wages have gone up everywhere.COLONEL AMERY: I mean relatively.THE PRIME MINISTER: Taking the actual figures, I was rather surprised. I asked Sir Robert Home to supply me with information on that topic, and in fact I was going to use it the other way, in order to show how much better the wages were here. I dropped it like a hot coal, because I found they were not much better than in Germany.
MR. ILLINGWORTH: I would stake ray existence that there will be a great shortage of labour in this country, and the emigration business ought to be discouraged.MR. CHURCHILL: I quite agree.THE PRIME MINISTER : It is a dangerous thing to put forward.   If there is anything to be done in the way of, I will not say promoting it, but making arrangement^ for it, I hope it will be done by private conferences with the Colonies, to begin withk/ If you introduced an Emigration Bill now it would have the worst effect upon the labouV3 situation I am sure, and I am doubtful about it.COLONEL AMERY : I cannot carry on the Conferences without your authority.THE PRIME MINISTER : Authority, yes ; but it is a Bill I am against.COLOiNEL AMERY: The Bill creates the authority, but not the emigration.DR. ADDISON : I share Mr. Illingworth&apos;s opinion as to the future and all his prognostications. We have lost the best producers in the war, and if we are going to encourage the next best producers to emigrate, how are we going to be solvent in the future ?THE PRIME MINISTER: The Minister of supply has a stock of.raw material, and I should like to ask him whether that is at a price he cannot keep up this is one of the things which have been put to me and whether it is not worth his while to consider the cutting of his loss and selling his raw material at the prices which are likely to obtain in the market when there is a free market ?LORD INVERFORTH : That is exactly what we are doing now. We have got practically a six or twelve months&apos; supply. My idea is that the Government ought to keep the materials as a stock-the cost is 24,000,0001. now--and open the market and keep production going. We cannot afford to let production go down. Then stabilise the prices in combination with other countries. Once that is done you will have confidence established.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : It will help us if you would state what the policy is. You wish to discourage emigration, and you wish to retain the inflation. Is it to be taken as the policy of the Government that all the money that is required for these social improvements is to be found&apos;(   Is that to be a first charge ?THE PRIME MINISTER: It is not merely that we, are to be pledged. I want to look ahead and see how we can guarantee the peace of this country. Nothing struck me more, in the conversations I had with the miners, than the paft this plays in the general irritation which has made them unreasonable.SIB, R. HORNE : Have you seen the way they live ?THE PRIME MINISTER: Sir Robert Home or somebody was telling me the other day how a well-to-do man went to remonstrate with the miners. One of them, a fairly educated man and a Scotsman, said &quot; Do you know the place I live in ?&quot; He lives in one of those houses that are back-to-back, with all the sewage brought right through the living room, and he has all his children living in that place. He said &quot; Supposing your children lived in those conditions, what would happen to you ? &quot; The well-to-do man said frankly &quot; I should be a Bolshevik.&quot; Confidence is the thing you want to restore, and you will get no confidence until there is a certain contentment in the labour world. I believe the introduction of a series of Bills we are preparing now one after the other, showing real determination on our part to deal with it not sham Bills, but real Bills-will have a great effect in quieting labour. It is their conviction that they have come in vain to the doors of Parliament, and that premises made by one party or another have only produced measures that did nothing. The Town Planning Bill has not produced three houses; the Small Holdings and Allotments Bill has not produced anything substantial they have not made a real change. That is the kind of thing that has made them feel &quot; Well, it is no good going to Parliament, we must trust to our own power,&quot; and they strike, and a strike may end in a revolution. You have first of all to give confidence in the Government to the people, for the Government means as much for them as it does for the well-to-do classes. Until you do that it is no use trying to build up trade in this country.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : Mr. Prime Minister, I do not want you to think that I differ from you, where, in fact, there is no difference.   I should like to say that there
are two quite distinct problems which are getting mixed up in our discussion. They do overlap, and they bear upon one another, but we should have the distinction between them in mind. There is the question of unemployment and the question of what our social policy is to be, for the social and political reasons which you have put forward.THE PRIME MINISTER : And the economic policy.I MR. CHAMBERLAIN : I agree that our housing problem has got into such a ^condition that it is a source of danger to the stability of the State, and that we have got to deal with that problem, in accordance with the programme which we took to the electors, on broad and generous lines, and go ahead with it as fast as we can, with due regard to carrying it out properly. I think that ought to be the first charge on the public resources which we have. Then in their order come the other things. For example the land settlement of ex-soldiers. That is a special thing, and that ought to come first. We ought to go on with these things in what measure we can, and do all the departments would ask us to do. At the same time, we cannot have both a tremendous development at home and all the development we should like to have abroad. On the social policy I am heartily with you, and it is the desire of the Treasury to facilitate its execution, but that is rather distinct from the immediate question, of unemployment. It is true that among the social schemes it may be desirable to utilise our resources at the moment on those which will give the greatest immediate return in labour as a help to the solution of the unemployment question. But far more important than these Government schemes from the point of view of unemployment is the setting to work of trade. That really is only incidentally affected by our social programme; it is rather dependent upon individual men and people placing orders with individual manufacturers, and manufacturers finding a market for their goods.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : Is not the full programme as put forward by the Federation of British Industries- -which is the most extreme thing I have seen in that line incompatible with what I believe to be essential, the pushing forward of the social side ?MR. BONAR LAW : It is incompatible with anything. THE PRIME MINISTER: What are their demands ?MR. BONAR LAW : That the Government should pay all their losses on their pre-war contracts, and all their losses on stocks.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : And guarantee their trade for so many years, and so on.THE PRIME MINISTER : I do not think we need go into that. MR. CHAMBERLAIN : It is quite absurd.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES: That has been put forward at our meetings in Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s absence by his Advisory Council.THE PRIME MINISTER : Does the Advisory Council recommend it?SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES: They are the Federation of British Industries in a sense.SIR ALBERT STANLEY: These suggestions were put forward by the Board of Trade for the consideration of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the first instance ; they are not for Cabinet discussion at this stage. They are suggestions put forward as the result of discussions with our business advisers. The business advisers are the President of the Federation of British Industries, the President of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, Lord Colwyn, and Sir Henry Birchenough. These are the four men, and they made certain recommendations to the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade, without making them a departmental recommendation, passed them on to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and it may be that we shall have an interview and a discussion before any action is taken. That is as far as they go. I think that is the line to take, because I feel it is the function of the Board of Trade to put forward to the proper department, which must be the Exchequer, recommendations which are made by representative associations in the country. Whether we accept them or not is another thing.
ME. CHAMBERLAIN: As a matter of fact I have seen a deputation from the Federation of British Industries, which includes all the big controlled firms. It came to talk to me about the excess profits duty, and they put before me this long list of demands. I told them, quite politely, I hope, but quite plainly, that they were asking me the impossible, and that no Government would listen to such demands. .MR. ILLINGWORTH : The Federation of British Industries and the Chambers o\ Commerce put forward these extravagant demands, not with any expectation of -thei( being met in their entirety, but trusting that certain concessions at any rate will be granted, and that they will get somethingMR. CHURCHILL : If the Minister of Munitions could give a lot of orders to these big firms with whom we have relations. I think that is one of the things that should be done on as large a scale as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER : Orders for what ?MR. CHURCHILL : Things that will be useful. The Government should take a broad view that there are -certain things which will be needed, and ought to be ordered. Another thing 1 am told is that you ought to increase the Government trader&apos;s confidence by safeguarding them to some extent from the fear of a falling market. I am told that it is a comparatively small sum of money that will be needed in that way.THE PRIME MINISTER : Do you mean on the raw material-on the metal ?MR. CHURCHILL : I mean on the manufacture. If you say &quot; Make this, or that, or the other particular thing, and we will guarantee you this or that price for it when it is produced,&quot; you enormously emphasise the ease with which the turnover is effected.MR. BONAR LAW : That is dangerous, for this reason. Suppose you begin giving orders of that kind to people for things to be kept in stock, no one else will make them.LORD INVERFORTH : I am entirely against that. There are any number of orders all round, and they can be fully employed if they had the confidence to go on.. There is no necessity for the State to carry the trade ; they can carry themselves.SIR R. HORNE : If the Government ,went into the market it would be the greatest encouragement to get other traders to move, because they would realise that they would not get the raw material they required unless they came in early.THE PRIME MINISTER : They require locomotives and electrical machinery-anything of that kind.MR. BONAR LAW : Any real demand of the Government is on a different footing.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES: There was a policy of ordering material for housing in bulk, and that was designed because it was obviously necessary that the material should be produced somewhere. We were told last night at a conference we were holding that that policy is undergoing modification. There is a case where we have no guiding policy. I do not know about the detail, but I understand the policy now is that parts of houses should be manufactured locally by the people who are actually putting up the houses.THE PRIME MINISTER: Doors, windows, staircases, and things of that sort.DR. ADDISON: I know of no modification except with regard to sets of furniture. There was a proposal that we should order sets of furniture, and it was unanimously felt that that was too risky an enterprise, because nobody would have the furniture when it was made. So far as 1 know the only modification which has been made is that we did not venture to order them. It; was put up to me, and I said I would not take the risk of asking Lord Inverforth to make sets of furniture.MR. CHx^MBERLAIN : Mr. Arthur Pease made a suggestion at yesterdays Conference which I thought had great force. He said if the Minister of Supply, in dealing with his great stocks of metal, would not only bring the prices down to what he anticipated would be the post-war level, but would bring them down a little below and then begin to raise them again by 6d. and Is., that that would set orders flowing in more readily than anything else.
LORD INTER FORTH : I do not think so. If you are going to set up a policy, make the policy quite clear and tell the country what you are going to do to keep production going, and not find out afterwards that we have no production and have to pay any price that America asks.THE PRIME MINISTER : There are here four business men in front of me who engaged in trade and business on a considerable scale.   I will put two questionsi&apos;tb them.   I will hand over to them for the moment the British Empire as a concern.Supposing they had it, first of all having regard to&apos; the condition of the world, or the financial difficulties and financial burdens, and having regard also to the fact that for four or five years the needs of the world have not been supplied, would they feel any despair about finding sufficient employment for everybody in this country provided the right course were taken to set the machine going ? The second question is this: Supposing they had it as such a concern, and they were at the head of it, and they could give orders as managing directors, what course would they adopt in order to set the machine going ?LORD INVERFORTH: On your first question I should have more employment than men to employ. On the second question I should want, first of all, to deal with excess profits, tell the country plainly what is in the future for them, what they are going to have to keep, what they are going to get to extend their works, and what profit will accrue to them, because unless that confidence is established, and quickly established, you will never do any good at all, and you will have trouble of all kinds. I will give you an example I had the other day of one of our machines, which cost  800 before the war. We asked for the price of that machine now and the price was  2,400. The engineer was ashamed of it, and came to the office and said : &quot; Here is my tender, but candidly I do not want the order, because I do not want the business at all.&quot; That is the condition all over the country.MR. ILLINGWORTH : So far as No. 1 is concerned, as I said just now, in twelve months&apos; time I would stake my existence upon the shortage of labour in the countiy. As far as No. 2 goes, I should say : Take measures to restore or create confidence-Then, if you wanted to go into details of what to do, I should want to think it over and reason it out. It would take an hour or two to go into it. There are so many things that people are uneasy about. If you take the labour question, probably a hundred points would crop up in the labour position to be dealt with, and such as the question of raw materials, the question of exchange, the questions that will arise when trade gets going, and the shortage of credit. /THE PRIME MINISTER : That is when trade gets thoroughly going.MR. ILLINGWORTH : Yes. Not only that, there are at present these restric-tions which have been put on and taken off, not only by this country, but as has been done lately by France. I believe because they are not in a position to pay, for goods. They have suffered from restriction of imports into their country. There are many of these things, and one could go on for an hour or two if one had time to think them over. The general things are restoration of confidence or creation of confidence.SIR ERIC GEDDES : I think there will be a period of unemployment, and I think it is most desirable to get emigration arrangements going for that reason. I do not know whether that period will last over twelve months or not. I think it is desirable for two reasons : one, that there will be a large body of men who will be dissatisfied and want to get to the Colonies. The present home-life they will not like, and I think it will be a valuable safety-valve to get emigration arrangements in being. Personally, I do not fear that after it may be 12, 18, or 24 months the country cannot support its population. I do not think emigration will be so great as really to have much effect of that kind, but it ought to be. provided for as a safety-valve. I think it is inevitable that those two years of the post-war period you should treat from the point of view of expenditure as years during the war. You must be prepared to spend money and treat it as part of war expenditure in order to employ people. The best way to employ them is upon the schemes which we are all agreed are essential these social schemes. I think during that period you will have to allow people to get out of the country or &apos; employ them, because you cannot keep giving them doles and keep them contented. You must be prepared to spend money on after-the-war war problems as you did during the during-the-war problems. That must be found, and added to our war debt if necessary. It is the period of reconstruction, and money has to be spent generously, and on thosse schemes.   If we get over that period I think the trade of the country will revive.
There is no reason why it should not. To nurse industry, as has been suggested, by guaranteeing them against loss I think would be fatal; it would be absolutely invertebrate if you did that. I am dead against anything of that kind. As to the present position of trade, I think, as Mr. Illingworth says, it would take some time to write them all down, but it is the uncertainty more than anything else that is keeping trade from going on. Take one thing. I got an application the other day from waggor; repairers and waggon builders, saying they were ready to build waggons and the railway/ \ would not give them airy orders. Of course, it was not my concern at that time, but I talked to two or three railway people about it, and they said &quot; We will not give orders because the prices are so high.&quot; We have had accountants going into the present-day reasonable prices in certain firms&apos; works, as to what would be reasonable prices, taking cost of labour, material, and so on, and those people are asking too much. The same with locomotives. It is because of the uncertainty. The excess profits tax is one of the principal of them all, but there are a dozen or twenty other uncertainties which are making the trade of the country hold back, and excess profits is one of them. The price of raw materials, the control of raw materials, the attitude of labour, the War Pledges Bill those are the uncertainties which will keep the trade of the country back.   That is my view.SIR ALBERT STANLEY : First of all, I think there will not be the measure of unemployment that some people fear. I think we are unduly apprehensive at the present time. -Trade will substantiate itself in time. We are in a war atmosphere still, and it will not change all of a sudden. We must wait till we get peace, and then I think a change will take place. I am not fearful myself about the lack of employment in this country after the next few months have gone by. We must go through a period when there will be considerable unemployment, because there is so much uncertainty as to how and when trade will establish itself. Capital is not being attracted into trade at the present time ; it is very nervous, now. On the second point, if I had to run this magnificent enterprise, if I had that responsibility which Heaven forbid ! I should say get rid of the controls first of all, get rid of all the restrictions, and get trade and industry back to where they were, so far as general principles are concerned. We should at least know where we- were then. We should have the responsibility back upon tens of thousands of people in industry, and upon them will be the responsibility for the development of our trade and industry. I should sweep away the controls, and leave only so much, of the restrictions as is absolutely necessary in the opinion of the Supreme War Council to deal with the question of blockade. There, again, I should be liberal in order to get some of the trade going again. So far as the financial aspects of the problem are concerned, I should get rid of the excess profits duty. So long as that exists you cannot expect capital to venture into new enterprise. The margin of profits is bo small that it is not really good enough for capital to be risked. I should deal with the question of depreciation of equipment, &amp;c, much more scientifically than has been done in the past; there must be a broad, liberal policy. I should also deal with the question of the huge losses with which our traders are confronted in respect of the stocks they are carrying. As to how it should be done I have not any plan to suggest, but I do think it is a problem which has to be faced.MR. BONAR LAW : Do you know it is provided for, that stocks for two years are to be paid back ?MR. MUNRO : That is stocks they are holding.SIR ALBERT STANLEY : There are certain provisions for recoupment out of excess profits, but it is limited, and does not anything like meet the general situation.&apos; If I might go on, I should deal with that question and provide for legislation at once, so as to secure a contented mind so far as that is concerned. Finally, I would deal with the question of preference within the Empire, and secure a policy on that.SIR ROBERT HORNE : I have been much [interested in what the Ministers . have said with regard to the prospects of employment, but if you are going to put off. the prospects of employment for a year you will have a situation in the interval which will be extremely serious and grave.MR. ILLINGWORTH : You misunderstood me, I think. I did not mean that there would be unemployment for a year, but from now onwards, perhaps for another six months.   In a year&apos;s time there will be a shortage of labour.SIR ROBERT HORNE: What I do feel is essential is that operations should take place now in order to prevent the amount of unemployment which we must
foresee for some months to come, at any rate; otherwise you may have a state of affairs in which employment is not worth giving at the end of that period. The situation is going to be serious, and it is already serious. Unemployment last week mounted up out of all proportion to the previous week. What I am anxious to know is whether the State is placing all the orders it can at the present time. It is all very well for the private adventurer to be hesitating about placing his orders because of the high prices of material and labour, but there is no excuse, in the condition in which we are, for the State not placing orders.. The State is paying unemployment money to the nation now, and it is cheaper to give employment even at the inflated prices of material and labour to-day. I am very anxious, therefore, that you should make it certain that every order which any Department of State can place, with due regard to the future, should be placed now, even at the high prices. It would be cheaper in the long run, and save us from disaster.THE PRIME MINISTER: The German Government always did that when there was a period of unemployment, and the same thing is done in India.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : Sir Auckland Geddes raised that question on an earlier day, and I think in regard to one particular Department it has been found out that they were holding up really for a fall in the stocks.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : And you suggested a way out. *MR. CHAMBERLAIN: It was agreed that that should be dealt with at once, and I understood that Sir Auckland was going to enquire into other departments to see whether the same thing was being done.SIR ROBERT HORNE : It is a menace to the State, and may end in disaster.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES: To take that point, in the case of railways you get a very clear distinction between the State and the railways. I speak subject to correction, but this is what I am told, that the railways to-day are vastly in arrear with their betterment programmes and the improvement of their accommodation to deal with the traffic which they know will come. They will not place the orders now because they say it is going to be too expensive. In their position they say, &quot; We are not going to start these works; we must go without them.&quot;SIR ROBERT HORNE: You will land yourself in a position in which the traffic will never come, at that rate.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES: Yes, but that can only be done by the Government.SIR ROBERT IIGRNE: The Government has got to do it now. You cannot afford to delay it any longer. I have met a considerable number of manufacturers, and they would be greatly encouraged if the orders were placed. One of them gave me an instance of half&apos;a dozen enterprises that he knew with which the State or local authorities were concerned, none of which was going ahead. The result was that every private manufacturer and every man with an order to place was holding back, saying, &quot; If the State are holding back under these conditions, what about us ? &quot;MR. CHAMBERLAIN : The railways are not the State, and it is an embarrassing position. The railways are doing this; they will not place their own orders, but they are jealous of having any other orders placed with the railway workshops, lest when they want to place their orders they will find them full.SIR ERIC GEDDES : They are working in their own shops at the maximum.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES : We decided yesterday to get the restrictions taken off.^ DR. ADDISON : I have a list of 11,000,0001 worth, which can be placed to-morrow, if necessary.THE PRIME MINISTER: I think we have had a very valuable discussion, and, as far as I am concerned, an enlightening discussion. I was glad to hear from those who have met the business associations, being men of aftairs themselves, that they are able to assure the Cabinet that, in their judgment, there is no real apprehension as to the future of British trade and British industry. I must say that that is the view I had formed, but I do not feel that I am as qualified to express an opinion as they are. I thought the needs of the world were so great that somebody would have to supply
them, and ourselves and America must do it. There are four things which, as far as I can gather from all those who have spoken, have got to be set right in order to get a real start. First of all, there are these restrictions. I have heard so much on that point from almost every quarter that I feel confident that, even if there is no substance in it, the mere apprehension--SIR ALBERT STANLEY : It is there.THE PRIME MINISTER: lam not doubting it for a moment. The fact th&amp;M it is there is acting as a kind of bogey, and we shall not advance along the road until something has been done to ease matters in respect of restrictions. Of course, the best way would be to make peace terras, then there would be, no justification for the blockade, especially if we can ensure the disarmament of Germany, and that I think we can do. The first thing I did in Paris a month or six weeks ago was to propose disarma-ment, because I thought that was the root of the business. The moment you disarm Germany and destroy her munition works you can withdraw the restrictions. That is one of the first things I shall do when I go back, when we have got rid of the troubles here. Once that was done, you might remove restrictions on a considerable scale. Take what Sir Albert Stanley said about 100,000,0007. of British orders already executed and only awaiting transport.*     SIR ALBERT STANLEY : That is the value of our export trade with other countries.THE PRIME MINISTER: That is the first thing to do, as it seems to me, and I should like to be advised, before I return on Friday, by Sir Albert Stanley and anybody else who has the necessary information, in order to equip me as to in what direction I ought to press for the removal of these restrictions. You cannot remove them here without removing them in France and eisewhere. It must be an international business. That is the first thing I should like the President of the Board of Trade to supply me with. I should like him to supply me with a list of the commodities which are awaiting export. That would give me an idea. The second is this : Government orders. I sympathise entirely with the Minister of Labour about this. I think the Government must take some risks here. A good deal depends.upon the Minister of Supply. He can only do it up to a certain point. I am sure he could do it in conjunction with the prospective Minister of Ways and Communications. He has got rails and locomotives and trams and electric machinery-he has all these things to think about, and he should think of all he could do in a short time when he sees what kind of reception the House of Commons gives to his measure. Whether they are likely to obstruct or let it through, I should say he was in a position without waiting-SIR ALBERT STANLEY : It is ready, and has been for a long time.THE PRIME MINISTER : What is ready ?SIR ALBERT STANLEY: A schedule of orders.THE PRIME MINISTER: I should like him to take in hand the giving of these orders to the Ministry of Supply, and that at the earliest possible moment, for 1 am certain the Government ought to begin by giving confidence to traders first, and you have to get over this interim period. First of all, then, the President of the Board of Trade will supply me with all these things, and tell me what kind of restrictions he wants removed. Then the prospective Minister of Ways and Communications is to consider the question- of anticipatory orders, which will enable the Ministry of Supply to set going some of the industries.SIR ALBERT STANLEY : That is a matter where the Exchequer will have to agree to taking the risk of the Bill going through.THE PRIME MINISTER : All this affects the Exchequer. The same thin,g applies&apos; to houses. Steps ought to be taken about that, to give the necessary orders there for the essential material for building. I do not think the people of this country will believe we are going to build houses until they find something is being done. The Post Office, also, had better give a list of the things they want, and let them be con-sidered at once.MR. ILLINGWORTH : It is in with the Treasury now.DR. ADDISON : Does that include public works?   We have a list of works held up&apos; to the extent of 11,000,0007.., schools, baths, and that sort of thing.
THE PRIME MINISTER: Unemployment is growing, and it may rapidly become a source of grave1 social disaster. Therefore let those things be considered by the Treasury. Thirdly, there is a question of excess profits, and here, again, the Treasury comes in. A suggestion has been put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer which I think is an admirable one, that to-morrow at 3 o&apos;clock he should have a conversation with those who have taken part in the discussion on excess profits *tr imports. The Postmaster-General has useful information on the subject. The suggestion is that Sir Auckland Geddes; the President of the Board of Trade, the Postmaster-General, and Sir Robert Home should meet Mr. Chamberlain to-morrow at 3 o&apos;clock in the Treasury Board Room,,SIR ERIC GEDDES : On the question of railway orders, Sir Albert Stanley has got all the information, and if you decide that, without waiting for this Ministry and without waiting for the additional power we are to have, which will take six weeks or so, the State is to take its courage in both hands--THE PRIME MINISTER : If you will discuss that together, and if you satisfy Sir Albert Stanley, he has the authority to give the orders.SIR ERIC GEDDES : That might save two months.THE PRIME MINISTER: All these things give confidence to Capital, and it is essential to give confidence to Labour as well. That is a much more difficult business, because they are thoroughly rattled and are greatly suspicious. Personally, I think a good deal has happened in the past which justifies their suspicion. Take the sort of stupid thing the shipbuilders did in Glasgow, trying to rob them of their five minutes at the beginning of the day. That is the kind of thing that annoys and exasperates them. Then take Smillie and the miners. We all know what has happened in the past, but it is no good telling them, that that is ancient history. It is in their bones, and you have to win back their confidence. Until we get that confidence back we shall get unrest. Unrest is one element, and lack of confidence on the part of Capital is another. Capital will not go on spending money and taking risks when they do not know whether in the course of the next three or lour months there will be some sort of upheaval which may involve them in bankruptcy. Therefore we have got to do our best to&quot; win them back, too. We will try and settle these immediate disputes, and if we cannot we shall have to fight the thing through. It may be a good thing, because Labour is getting unreasonable in some respects. 1 thought they were very unreasonable yesterday when they refused to give an extra fourteen days for investigation. It may be necessary to take a firm and strong line to bring them to reason. Still, we must do more than that, and I am sure that the introduction of these measures will show that we are prepared to deal on a large scale with the real grievances of theirs, the housing, the way in which they have been kept away from the land, the depopulation of this country, where the fathers of these people have been driven away from their homes, the divorce of the people from the land in a way which you have not got in any other country in the world, and the lack of social amenities of the villages, raising what they call their standard of life and anybody who has seen their wretched cottages knows what that means without any definition all these things have to be dealt with. Therefore I beg those who have Bills to press them forward at once. There is the Bill which is to be intoduced to-morrow, which I hope will be adequately explained, and, by &quot; adequately explained &quot; I do not mean merely giving its provision, but giving its scope and showing what it means that is really very important showing something of what is in the mind of the Minister, as to what he hopes to achieve by that Bill. You must kindle their imagination, you must give the people a horizon, or they will look at their wretched surroundings, and once they lose hope there is nothing but revolution and trouble. We must get away from that. We must give confidence to both classes of the community, the Capitalist and Labour, and if we do that I am sure that all these predictions are going to be realised. There is this Bill, and there is the Bill of the Local Government Board about housing. There is a Bill about dumping, but I have not seen it yet.SIR A. STANLEY: It is waiting to come before the Cabinet now. THE PRIME MINISTER : You will let me see it first.SIR A. STANLEY: Yes.
THE PRIME MINISTER : Give it to me&apos;before I go away. .Then there is the Electricity Bill.   I should like to see those two.   I have seen all but those two.MR. FISHER: Can anything be done to bring down food prices through Government action ?  &quot;That is a very important thing.THE PRIME MINISTER: Yes.   They are going to bring meat down by Ad. pound.   That is very substantial.SIR R. HORNE: I am getting out the effect of the proposed reduction now.THE PRIME MINISTER : You must tell the people something of that sort in order to show that we are not merely talking.   They are getting sick of talking.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., February 26, 1919.
