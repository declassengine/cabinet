This Oopurv *^ Property ofHis ^iy[s Government. $QgALIENS IK OOHU&amp;ND OP BRITISH shipd memorandum by the President of the Board ofTrade.V   During the war the Admiralty confined the issue of Confi-ential Route and Sailing Instructions to masters of merchant ships who could be regarded as entirely trustworthy, and as they found that British Merchant vessels had, in some cases, been commanded before the war by foreigners, they made it their general practice to refuse to give these Confidential Instructions to masters who were not &quot;British born of parents who, at the time of their sonfs birth, were themselves British subjects, by birth or by naturalisation&quot;.It was an essential part of the government tfar Risks Insurv ance Scheme that the master of a herchaat ship insured under the Scheme must obey all Admiralty Instructions, and it was accordingly impossible for a British shipowner to get the Government War Risks Insurance for hie vessel unless he gave the command to an officer who was in the category of those who received the Admiralty Confidential Instructions.   Thusf al-though there has been no statutory requirement that the command P.fa 3rjLisX34ip shaijsnly be, in the J&amp;uflajtf.a,, ftffift,^lft&amp; either before p or /during the war...the corina3^otir^rJLtiSh shinwas in effect limitepnEoBrTtish subjects during the war. wit&amp; S^aJ^jBxcjipiiQns..Cases of hardship arose soon after the limitation came into effect, and it was decided by the Admiralty to set up a Com-mittee to consider applications from those who did not come within the definition above mentioned, and if sufficient reason were shown to allow exceptions to be made to the rule.About 80 officers were thus allowed by this Admiralty Committee to receive the Confidential Instructions during hos-tilities, although they were not &quot;British bom of parents who, at the time of their sonfs birth, were themselves British subjects, by birth or by naturalisation&quot;.    In fact some few of them were of German blood.After the date of the Armistice the Admiralty Confidential Instructions became very much more limited in scope, and hare now in effect practically ceased to exist.    Such Instructions as exist are available for any shipmaster, and it is no longer essential for the owner of a Merchant ship to get insurance under the Government tfar Risks Insurance Scheme.Accordingly, unless some action is taken to prevent it, some of the Alien masters to whom Admiralty Confidential Instruc-tions were refused, will probably get back into the command of British ships.Representations have been received from members of Parlia-ment ana from the Mercantile ilarine Service Association, pro-testing against the command of British ships being in the hands pf Aliens, some being of German parentage.These representations, in so far as they emanate from British Officers, are probably due to some extent to the desire to remove from the field of competition the officer of alien birth;   the number of Aliens holding a Board of Trade Certifi-cate of Competency as shipmaster is believed to be considerable,although
^although no statistics are available.While the demand for limiting command of British ships to British subjects is thus not altogether disinterested it cannot I be regarded as satisfactory that, pending the conclusion of the war, Aliens excluded from command during active hostilities I should begin to be employed again, without official enouiry as to their trustworthiness, m the responsible post of master of a British ship;It is accordingly proposed,, after a conference between re- ISreaentatives of the Board of Trade, the Admiralty and the Inistry of Shipping, and pending fuller consideration of thefeneral question whether in peace time British ships should e allowed to be commanded by Aliens, to make a Defence of the Realm Regulation that will merely effect, during the remainder I of the war, the same object as was achieved by the Admiralty.   1 in connexion with the issue of Confidential Instructions.  The following Defence of the Realm Regulation is proposed:-i&apos;37D. A person shall not, unless specially authorised I for the time being by the Admiralty or Board of Trade act in the capacity of master or person in charge of a British merchant snip unless he is a natural-born British 1 subject, and the son of parents both of whom were at the time of his birth either natural-born British subjects or British subjects by naturalisation,, and if any person acts in contravention of this regulation he shall be guilty of a summary offence against these regulations.It is also proposed that the Admiralty Committee for coa- I sidering these question (the Alien Masters Committee) shall continue, and that en officer of the Board of Trade shall be appointed as a member of the Committee.    All exceptions al-ready allowed by tho Committee would hold good, ana the Com-committee, with the addition of a Board of Trade member, would consider any applications that might henceforward be made by those who would be prevented by the rule from being given, tie  command of a ship.*No means of securing the object aimed at appears avail-able except a Defence of the Realm Regulation, and although this will not operate indefinitely, the question whether a case exists for such a rule after the war has come to an end can be considered during its operation.   Consideration is in fact already being given by the Board of Trade, in con-junction with other Cepartments concerned, to the question whether in the interests of national safety the employment of aliens in certain industries should not be prohibited or restricted.A.H.  STANLEY.Board of Trade,21st February, 1919.
