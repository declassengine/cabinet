This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the War Cabinet, February, 1919.105/Gen. No./2716.WAR CABINET.&quot;All GK*&amp;CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS.Memorandum by the Secretary op State for War.The attention of the Cabinet is drawn to the attached Memorial about Conscientious Objectors now undergoing a sentence of imprisonment.I consider that, with the cessation of the fighting, a review of this question has become necessary. A sentence of two years&apos; imprisonment with hard labour is the maximum permitted by law. The severity of this sentence is well known, and it frequently produces worse effects upon a man than a lengthy term of penal servitude. Being forced to examine this question anew, I cannot believe that it would be right to inflict imprisonment with hard labour under various sentences for a period of more than two years. Conscientious Objectors who have done that term should, therefore, be released from imprisonment and discharged from the Army with ignominy in the usual way.Under this procedure about 700 of the 1,350 Conscientious Objectors now serving sentences of hard labour would be immediately released, and the remainder as they complete the two-year period, which, in 95 per cent, of the cases, would be within the currency of the present year. To go on passing these sentences upon the same men for an indefinite period after the fighting has stopped, and while conscription is still indefinitely prolonged, would be to incur the reproach of senseless cruelty. On the other hand, a severe penalty is still needed to enforce compliance with the Military Service Acts during the continuance of the compulsory period. I think, however, that two years&apos; imprisonment with hard labour should be sufficient for this, especially having regard to the.fact that the fighting has stopped.I have consulted the Military Members of the Army Council and they are unanimously of the opinion that the course here proposed is a wise one, and that while it will not be popular it will not be resented unduly in the Army.I should, therefore, propose to act upon it and to announce it in Parliament next week, and I. trust that the War Cabinet will find it possible to approve this policy on Monday or Tuesday.W. S. CHURCHILL.22nd February, 1919.(B19/123)  60  2/19  H&amp;s  6897wo
MEMORIAL TO THE PRIME MINISTER.We, who hold different views on the actions of Conscientious Objectors, are united in the opinion that the time has come when they should be forthwith released. There are now 1,500 of these men in prison, 700 of whom have served terms of two years or more, whereas two years is the maximum punishment allowed for ordinary criminals under either our civil or military code. As a result of recent enquiries it was found that a large majority of these men are sincerly convinced that they have acted under the demands of their conscience and in accordance with deep moral or religious conviction.We urge that men in prison under these conditions should not be kept there during the period of national rejoicing, and that our country should not show itself slow at such a time to carry through an act of just mercy; it is hardly necessary to remind you of the statements made by responsible ministers when the Military Service Act was under discussion in Parliament. Mr. Walter Long, on 11th May, 1916, said, &quot;Nobody in the Government wants the horror of men who, for conscience sake, are unwilling to serve, being thrown into gaol for a long time.&quot;Surely now that the fighting has ceased, all possible occasion for harsh treatment has disappeared, and we, therefore, urge the immediate release of all such prisoners.I.
