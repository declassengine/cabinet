(P 1061)        From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,24th February 1919.Clear the line.Foreign Secret. 1 deeply regret news of A.i:nir&apos;s death both on personal and public grounds.

Your Excellency may rest assured.&quot;Comments and outline draft reply follow.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 24th February 1919.(Received 24th, 10.30 pan.)Clear the line.Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Roos-Keppel, 24th February : &quot;Following is story of AmiYs death current here. At 3 a.m., 20th February,. Amir was sleeping in his tent or pavilion at Laghman in camp when two men entered, shot him with pistols, stabbed him and went away, nobody interfering. Amir only lived a short time. News quickly reached Jalalabad, and Nasrulla and Inayatulla went out and brought back Ainir&apos;s body in a motor-car. Funeral was the same day, and after funeral all present saluted Nasrulla as Amir, apparently with acquiescence-of Inayatulla, it is believed. At funeral it was noticed that some prominent men were * missing, and. it transpired that they had fled to Kabul where it is believed that they will induce one of late Am.ir&apos;s younger sons to proclaim either himself or Inayatulla as Amir. It is not believed here that Inayatulla (? Nasrulla) can maintain himself as Amir unless lie does away with Inayatulla and other rivals. It is generally supposed that murder was result of ( ? ) plot to which AmiYs guards were privy. There is no excitement in Peshawar, but much interest and curiosity. Does Government want any mark of respect shown to late Amir such as flying half mast, closing offices? Mourning ceremonies begin to-day and last for three days.&quot;I have already directed that all public offices shall be closed and flags half-masted on the (&apos;? 28th February).if
mY&apos; v   *?7   .      From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 2bth February 1919.(Received 11 o&apos;clock.)Clear the line.Secret. Afghanistan. My telegram of yesterday. Nasrull.a&apos;s haste in addressing me (he lost even less time than llabibulla on his accession) is very satisfactory. His letter though more reserved than HabibulhVs, is friendly and unexceptionable in tone. It is of course possible (as Peshawar report(s) repeated last night suggested) that his accession may be challenged, but the completeness of the (? fait accompli) renders this highly improbable. In any case it would be dangerous to hold up our acknow-ledgement. What we want are a peaceful succession and a friendly Amir. If the former were hanging in the balance, delay might turn the scale ; it would almost certainly cost us Nasrulla&apos;s friendship.   Following is text of reply I propose : &quot; (R.) I have received from Your Majesty with deepest regret the lamentable news of the untimely death of your brother, His Majesty the late Amir Habibulla Khan, Siraj-ul-millat-wad-din. United from of old by ties of friendship, the British Government and Government of Afghanistan are now united by a common sorrow. For while Afghanistan mourns the loss of a great ruler, who ever sought the welfare of his countrymen and by his wise statesmanship preserved it from.the horrors which the war, just ended, has brought to so many nations, the British Government mourns the loss of a staunch friend, who throughout his reign, maintained firm the alliance between the two Governments. It gives me pleasure to learn that Your Majesty has been unanimously acknowledged by members of the Royal Family and by the religious, civil and military representatives as their Amir, and has peacefully succeeded to the Throne of Afghanistan. I thank Your Majesty for your friendly consideration in hastening, even amid the universal grief, (&apos;? to) set my mind at rest.&quot; Your Majesty has expressed that friendship and friendly intercourse between the Government of Afghanistan and the Government of Great Britain will be daily strengthened and increased by your efforts and mine. That friendship between the two Governments is based on treaties and engagements concluded with the British Government by late Zai-ul-Millat-Wad-din and confirmed by late Siraj-ul-Millat-Wad-din (?), and I understand clearly from what you say that you are prepared to abide by them. For my own part, Your Majesty may rest assured that it will be my constant endeavour to foster the friendly relations between the two Governments, and I trust Your Majesty will never hesitate to write your friendship on matters which concern the two Governments generally as freely and frankly as was customary of your lamented brother on whom be peace.&quot;Draft follows on general lines of Habibulla precedent, and in accordance with it I recommend personal message of condolence and congratulation from King-Emperor.Two important communications from Habibulla remain unanswered.    Unless and until Nasrulla indicates his own wishes regarding them I propose to ignore both, treating them as cancelled by HabibuhVs death,   The first is the Peace Conference letter.    The second, a routine subsidy letter to Foreign. Secretary, dated 11th *\ February, asking for despatch in gold bullion of the crore of rupees offered in myunacknowledged letter of 8th July, together with 17 lakhs of his balance in which he included additional subsidy of 2 lakhs he had hitherto refrained from recognising.From Viceroy, 25th February 1919. (Received 26th, 10.30 a.m.)Clear the Line.Secret. My telegram of 24th February. Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 25th February. &quot; Travellers in caravan which left Jalalabad dated 22nd February confirm the report in my telegram 554 except in small details. Amir was shot through the head and died remonstrating. Murderers said to have been his Glmlam Bachas or personal attendants. Nasrulla at funeral offered to proclaim Inayatulla Amir, but latter refused and ashed Nasrulla to take it. Amir&apos;s body will be exhumed and taken to Kabul later. Nasrulla announced increase of pay Rs. 3 a month to Afghan Army. Afghans openly say that Amir&apos;s murder was arranged by Nasrulla with consent of Inayatulla. The Khutba was read in Jalalabad in NasruhVs name in Friday&apos;s prayers. Mullahs of Afghanistan and frontier tribes are said to rejoice at death of Habibullah and accession of Nasrulla.
