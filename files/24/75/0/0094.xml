00;I. ol^cilat/e the attached Memoranda on War Bonus^    388 on Disabled Officers&apos;&apos; Pensions^and on Alternative Pensions, for the urgent consideration of the War Cabinet.(ogd) L. Worthington-Eransr6/C/19.
War Bonus for Disabled Officers ,k War Bonus of 20% on disablement pensions payable to disabled men cf non-commissioned rarnt was granted by the War Cabinet last year; the question of.the extension of a similar concession to officers Was left over for further consideration by the Sub-Committee of the Cabinet on Pay and Allowances at their meeting on the 2nd December last.The matter was raised in many quarters curing the recent Election;and has been pressed strongly cn the Ministry. It is the subject cf constant questions in the House of Commons.   I have, therefore; caused the question to be further considered in my Department, and I have submitted a Memorandum with amended proposals (copy attached marked A) to the War Cabinet Committee on Sailors&apos; and Soldiers1 Fay.   These proposals were considered at the meeting cf the Committee this morning; but were not accepted, on the casting vote of the Chairman.    In my opinion; however, the grounds of their objection do not adequately dispose of the questions -(a) It was objected that the scale of pensionallowed t o &quot;t f f icers&quot;&quot;byj&quot;6helloya 1&apos;&quot;warr i.Exj/bJs^suffi&quot;c 1 eritljf I lb e&quot;r al &quot;to &quot;make&apos; it ulnhe c e s sary &quot;to&quot; *gr?nt *t h?tb btrus *   This objection&quot;!^limit to disablement pension plus bonus.   An officer would hot be entitled to receive more than  300 a year -   including the War Bonus of 20% and a similarly graduated scale is provided for other classes, such as Naval &quot; Warrant Officers, Officers1 Widows, Nurses etc.    (See paragraph (d) of Memorandum A).(b) The disablement pension in the case ofjs. regular officer&apos;&quot;mlghx&quot;incluiue&apos;&quot;an&quot;eiement&quot;of Service pension&apos;; &quot;and&quot;&quot;if&quot;a war Bonus&quot;were granted for the&quot;disabl&quot;ement&quot;ip d&apos;emana for ane x ten sic n &quot;ffittflie &apos;. Service.. pe n ston&quot; 1   But&apos;t l ere&quot;&quot; i s a clea r&quot;&quot;d 1stincticn&quot;bexween &quot;the two cases .   An officer does net receive a disablement pension in addition to a Service pension.   The whole pension is a disablement pension though it may contain an element of Service pension which varies with the length of the officer&apos;s service.   Further, the fact remains that the officer retired because he is disabled although he may be entitled, by length cf service to a Service&apos; pension. Administratively, it is quite impracticable, especially under present conditions, to separate the element of Service pension for the purpose of the calculation of War Bonus,   Moreover, as compared with the whole number
of officers disabled in the present ?/ar, the proportion in  hose core Service considerations wculo enter is comparatively small and the distinction in these cases would be very difficult to maintain,(c) It was objected that the recent concession by the Government or^Freedom From&quot;&quot;Income &quot;Tax bT all&apos;d 1 s&apos;a B 1 ement &quot;pens&quot;ions was practTcally^ suiTTc&quot;ienFTo meet any present claim, for War Bonus t &quot;&quot;But the concession as regards Income Tax was given on quite etrier grounds than to meet the increased cost of living and although it might, at a later date, be taken into account If an,y claim is made for an extension of the War Eonus beyond the period for which it is justified by the present high cost of living, the concession cannot be used to meet the claim of the officer,if it is not now applied in the case of the men.   Moreover &quot;other ranks&quot; have the relief from Income Tax in addition to the 20% bonus.(d) Itjimssuj$g estecl by the Chairman of the Committee lHat cases where&quot; there was &quot;real&quot;need For an addition to the disablement pension coulclbe jneE adequate lyTy the granlTof&quot; discretionary assistance *I &quot;am Foundto say &quot;that I know &quot;of &quot;no machinery which could adequately undertake this.     The Special Grants Committee of my Department administer supplementary assistance in extreme cases cf hardship, but I dc not feel that I could ask Parliament to agree to meet the present demand for what is due to officers on the lines laid down by Parliament for the Special Grants Committee, which necessarily involve elaborate investigation into needs and means, and apart from this objection, it wnuld require a special rtaff to investigate all. classes, of claim which at present does not exist.     Other ranks have been granted the bonus without regard to their private means.For these reasons, I do not feel that it is possible to accept the decision of the Cabinet Committee. There is a strong demand at the present time for complete revision cf the Royal Pensions warrants dealing with officers,/ A complete refusal of the temporary bonus proposal will make It very much harder to, resist pressure for a general and permanent &quot;increase in the scale cf disablement pension to officers..I also ask that the 20/o bonus should apply to Alternative pensions and that the men!s bonus should be extended to the last pay-cay In September 1319.L * .i * E,Minister of Pensions.
MBfepRAyPIfo FOR --./JI CiZIxtf? .\ i/iEkOR/^OMi by the kinister of Pensions on:&apos; ** 1.     &quot;War bonus1 cn Officers&apos; Retired Pay and on pensions of Officers1 Relatives.2.      &quot;War bonus1 on alternative pensions of men and men&apos;a widows .3.     Extension of  &apos;Var bonus&apos; tc last pay day in September, 1919 .1&apos;     Offieers &amp; the 1r families.At the 43rd Meeting; of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay.Committee cn January 9th Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen, then . Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Pensions, undertook that the Ministry should bring forward proposals in the matter of a war bonus, on officers8 disablement pensions.I am of opinion that such a bonus must be conceded, both to disabled officers and nurses and to the relatives of deceased officers.The following is the proposal X wish.to submit for the Cabinet&apos;s approval:-(a) A bonus of 20% on the disability retired pay of officers and the disability pensions of nurses and Naval Warrant Officers, and on the pensions and children&apos;s allowances of widows and relatives   of officers and Naval Warrant Officers who have lost their lives through service in this war.(b) The bonus tc have effect from the 1st January 1919, until the end of September, 1919. For administrative and accounting reasons it is impossible to break the financial quarter, so we cannot go back to the date (November 1st, 1918) taken for mon.(c) Bonus to be assessed, on full retiree pay &apos;although including a service or wound element; under Article I ( ) of the Royal Warrant of the 1st August 1917 (relating to Regulars), under Article 1 (3) (Chelsea lens loners) and Article 1 (4) (wound pension cases)f&apos; &apos; * &apos;    (6 s
(d) All ranks, to be eligible, Dut there should be mcne: limits of pension and bonus combined, viz: -Officers  500 a year&apos;   Nurses  175 &quot;   &quot;  .Naval Kt, Of fleers  175 11   11Officera&apos; Wiaows  200 &quot;   &quot;(exclusive of children)Naval Wt.Officers &apos;  100 a yearWidows&apos; (exclusive of children)Officers&apos; Parents  100 a year or SistersNaval Wt .Officers  75   &quot;     &quot;Parents or Sisters(e)   Within the money limits detailed above, the bonus begranted to officers and officers&apos; widows.The total estimated, cost for the three months ending the 31st March, 1919 is  107,000.   Per the period to end September, the approximate amount will be  350,000.   These figures include the cost cf bonus on alternative pensions of about  2,000 for the period   to the 31st March 1919, and  5,000 for the next six months, ^&apos;     Alternative Pensions.I also propose, that the bonus shall be granted on alternative pensions to men and men&apos;s widows with effect from 1st January, 1919.The estimated cost of the bonus &apos;on alternative pensions for men and their widows for the thre^e months ending the 31st March 1919 is  50,000.   For the next six months the cost will be approximately  230,000&apos;. 5 *     Extension to September, 1919*The bonus on the flat rates pensions of disabled men and the dependants of deceased men was approved up to   30th June 1919 onlv.   I recommend that the bonus should be sanctioned
up to tiie last pay day in September 1919.The cost of this proposal will be about  2,000,000,(Sgd.)&apos;      L. Worthington-Evans.13, 2. 19i
