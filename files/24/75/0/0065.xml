Hs Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1s Government]WAR CA3IBIT.&quot;Quarantine accommodation for officers and soldiers dogs&quot;.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.Following on general demobilisation a large number of soldiers will want to bring their dogs home.      Under the Importa-tion of Bogs Orders no dog can be imported into the United Kingdom without a quarantine of six months.     The total quarantine accommodation now available for imported dogs and for dogs moved out of the infected areas in Devon and Cornwall would be sufficient for about 1,000 animals,       It meets existing demands;   but, if applications for import continue at their present rate, it will be exhausted within the next month.The demand for quarantine accommodation for soldiers&apos; dogs was anticipated by the Board in 19.17 when the question was discussed with the War Office.      A scheme for making provision was devised by the V/ar Office, which was accepted by the Board in May, 1918.      But on November 37th 1918 the War Office informed the Board that thev&quot;had decided to abandon their scheme.      At the same time, however, the Army Council accepted the offer of the R.S.P,C.A. to&apos; provide special accommodation at Hackbridge for 500 soldiers&apos; dogs at reduced rates -  2 per dog for six months as compared with the estimated ordinary cost of  14 per head,     On the 2nd December the Board pointed out that the accommodation available, even with the additional facilities for 500 dogs at Hackbridge, would be totally inadequate for the probable demand, and therefore requested the War Office to establish premises at the various ports of embarkation in France, Belgium and elsewhere for collecting and quarantine stations.       On nth February 1919 the V7ar Office decided that the Board&apos;s request for accommodation abroad could not be entertained.Two alternative methods of meeting the situation remain -(l)   to discontinue any attempt to provide further accommoda-tion for imported dogs and to concentrate on preventing smuggling;(2)   to authorise the expenditure of a sum not exceeding  40,000 in providing accommodation.The first alternative is recommended by General Blenkinsop, Veterinary Adviser to the Army Council.       The Board&apos;s Chief Veterinary Officer agrees that this would be the most effective way of dealing with the matter, provided the smuggling can be prevented. That means, however, the slaughter of several thousand dogs abroad. Unless this is done, there must remain the risk of spreading the disease through wholesale smuggling.     The entire prevention of the smuggling of dogs b,r soldiers would be almost an impossibility.Secret. i\ 6365.
My experience of the serious outbreak of rajfajjes in Devon and Cornwall compels me to support the expert view.But there is another aspect of the case to which I think it necessary to call the attention of the Cabinet.The adoption of the first alternative will create great dissatisfaction among returning soldiers, and public   sentiment will be stron/Tlv roused on behalf of the men and their dogs, many of which went &quot;over the top&quot; with their owners.The Cabinet mav decide that, in existing circumstances, this consideration is so important as to necessitate efforts to provide additional accommodation.       In that case, the second alternative onlv is open.       The expenditure would provide additional accommodation for from 1,300 to 1,400 dogs.The Var Office are in a better position than the Board to provide cheap kennels in this country on Jar Office lands.     But if insuperable difficulties prevent the War Office from undertaking the business, the Board might endeavour themselves to make more kennels available throughout the country, if the necessar&quot; funds are at once placed at their disposal.It should however be pointed out that the fee for six months keep and attendance is&apos;. estimated at  14, and, unlessthe Cabinet decide to reduce this fee in the case of soldiers to, say,  2, the provision of this additional accommodation will neither check smuggling nor assist the private soldier to retain his dog,ERNLE.22nd February, 1919.
