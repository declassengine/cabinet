CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS.I am In general agreement with the memorandum of the Secretary of State for War (G.T.6873) hut would point out that the character of a sentence of 2 years&apos; imprisonment with Hard Labour is not correctly stated.     The memorandum says:-&quot;The severity of this sentence is well known, and it frequently produces . &quot;worse effects upon a man than a lengthy term of penal servitude&quot;.The widely-hold belief that a sentence of two years&apos; hard labour is very severe, even more severe than one of penal servitude, is quite unfounded.   Since the prison reforms of 1898, when the treadwheel and the crank were abolished, a sentence of two years&apos; hard labour is not appreciably different from a sentence of two years imprisonment:   and is much less severe than a sentence of 3 years&apos; penal servitude,    Moreover, in the case of conscientious objectors the prisoner after serving twelve months in all, is accorded under Rule 243A a number of special privileges (association, extra letters, books, and visits, etc) which make- his treatment much easier than that of an ordinary prisoner.Further I feel that my colleagues before deciding should be made aware of the character of some of the men affected by Mr, Churchill&apos;s proposals.     Some are genuinely conscientious, but successive Hone Secretaries have had occasion to douhi.^-the genuineness of many, and tho conduct of some in prison is far worse than that of ordinary prisoners.     There, have been repeated and organised outbreaks of disorder and misbehaviour, and it has been almost impossible to maintain a reasonable standard of discipline,I suggest that the rule of release after two years imprisonment should n*t apply to the small number of men who are persistently carrying m a course of insubordination and gross misconduct,I further recommend that if Mr, churchill&apos;s proposal is adopted equally favourable treatment should be accorded to the men who have accepted work under the-. Committee on Employment of Conscientious Objectors,     Any who have served two years in all (partly in Prison and partly under the control of the Committee) should be discharged at once.     Those.who have not served two years might, in view of the fact that they have agreed to do work of national importance, be absolutely discharged after doing such work ts the satisfaction of the Committee for at least twelve months,     if these, proposals are adopted a fevi hundred conscientious objectors will remain under the Committee either because they have not completed the required period of service or because they have failed in conduct and industry, These might be gradually discharged as general demobilisation makes progress and they could be released without arousing resentment.E,S.26FEB1919
