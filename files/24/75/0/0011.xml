ACTION TAKEN.Reduction of Food Prices. A committee, consisting of one representative each of H.M. Treasury, the Board of Agriculture, and the Board of Trade, of the principal officers of the Ministry of Food, and of two members of the Consumers&apos; Council, has been appointed to examine the possibility of taking further steps (in addition to those already taken or under consideration) for reducing food prices. The Food Controller will be Chairman of the Committee.General Position of Food Supplies in the Event of the Interruption of Railway and other Transport Services. A number of steps have been taken by the Food Controller, in consultation with other authorities, to provide against local shortages of food in the event of a railway strike. It is of course impossible to guarantee that there will not be shortages in particular places, and if a prolonged strike took place or if it extended from the railway also to motor and horse transport, a very serious situation would naturally result.Generally speaking, however, the stocks of essential foods are distributed sufficiently widely and the arrangements for local transport are sufficiently complete to justify the hope that a strike, even for two or three weeks, would not lead to disaster so far as food is concerned. Beyond that period it is clearly impossible to make any forecast.(1) Transport. The Ministry are in constant and close touch with the Railway Executive, the Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen, and the Road Transport Board, and every assistance is promised in the transport of food should the present railway and other traD sport services be dislocated by the threatened strike.In the event of the railway transport seriously breaking down, the Road Transport Board, in view of the present distribution of foodstuffs, are satisfied that they can meet any reasonable demands upon them. The Road Transport Board have registers of motor and other vehicles in every district. The Food Commissioners and the Transport Officers of the Ministry are represented on all Divisional and Area Transport Boards, and have been instructed to arrange locally with such Boards any necessary transport, including the question of priorities.The Ministry of Munitions, who control a number of lorries, have also agreed to give the,Road Transport Board all assistance they can in the transport of food.The War Office have also agreed to place at the disposal of Food Commissioners such personnel and transport as may be available, having regard to military require-ments. Assistance from the military will, however, only be applied for if there is a serious emergency in any area and the civilian transport available is insufficient to cope with it. ,(2) Supplies. Generally speaking, the distribution of the stocks of essential foodstuffs gives no immediate cause for alarm should railway communication be suddenly interrupted. &apos;Flour. The Ministry&apos;s stocks of flour are large and widely distributed. Steps are being taken to increase stocks in two. districts (the North and East of Scotland, and North Wales) where the position is less satisfactory. Bakers and dealers are stated to have good supplies of flour, while millers on an average have four weeks&apos; supply of -wheat in hand. .The recent action taken by the Wheat Commission to increase the distribution of flour has proved satisfactory, the weekly release of imported flour having risen, asA  (33)7383-3   Pk 9  150  2/19   B&amp;S &apos;-A   -
2ithe result thereof, from 70,000 sacks a week to over .1.80,000 sacks, while the weekly-release of G.R. flour has increased by some 40,000 sacks.The shortage of Ministry stocks of flour in Scotland has been overcome, 40,000 tons having been placed in Glasgow, The present stocks in East Scotland are being immediately increased.Bacon. The Government stocks of imported bacon amount to 50,000 tons (or &quot;about seven weeks&apos; normal supply). They are distributed throughout the country (with the exception of North and South Wales and South Midland Divisions) in satisfactory quantities, the stocks being held at ports and in all large urban centres. For the past fortnight the bulk of the arrivals have been going inland for storage. Immediate steps have been taken to send sufficient supplies to North and South Wales and the Midland Divisions. In addition to the Government stocks there is widely distributed amongst wholesalers about 14,000 tons (or two weeks&apos; normal supply). Retailers also have about a week&apos;s supply in hand. Further, as regards rural areas, many of the population are self-suppliers.Milk. Arrangements have been made with the Road Transport Board to ensure as far as possible -a continuance of supplies of milk to large urban centres, though, naturally, this would be one of the points of greatest difficulty should any dispute occur. There are ample stocks of tinned milk in the country, and they are well distributed.(3) Hoarding. The Food Controller has had under consideration the question of revoking the Food Hoarding Order, so as to increase the distribution of foodstuffs in . the interior of the country and relieve the congestion at the ports. He has already granted concessions to householders to stock not more than a sack of flour, two dozen tins of milk, and a side of bacon, and does not consider it advisable to go further at the present time. Any further relaxation of the Order might seriously interfere with the equality of distribution and act to the prejudice of the less well-to-do members of the community in localities where for any reason there was a temporary shortage of any commodity. Nor is it thought that such relaxation would materially relieve this congestion at the ports, which is due to the great increase of imports consequent upon the cessation of hostilities, difficulties of inland transport, and the shortage of labour, both at the ports and at warehouses.(4) Additional Arrangements. All wholesalers and retailers throughout the country have been asked to keep their stocks on as high a level as possible.Food Commissioners have been granted powers to decrease the amount of any existing ration, and to ration any article of food at present unrationed.Food Commissioners have already power to requisition any article of food held by any trader, and instructions have been issued to them reminding them of this power and instructing them to use it to meet any local shortage.Food Commissioners have been informed of all Government stocks in their Division, and have been instructed to move any of these stocks to meet, any emergency.Generally, Food Commissioners have been entrusted with full discretion and powers for seeing that the essential foodstuffs in their Divisions are sufficiently and equally distributed.Food Council. Meetings of the Council were held on Thursday, February 6th, and Tuesday, February 11th.Proposals for the decontrol of bacon were approved, subject to further discussion with the trade and the Consumers&apos; Council. It was reported that H.M. Treasury would approve (1) the sale of the Ministry&apos;s stocks of bacon below cost price upon decontrol taking place;(2) the sale, proposed by Sir John Beale, of 30,000 tons of bacon to Germany, provided that Germany can pay in cash.In reference to the demands made by a section of the baking trade for. either an increase in the price of bread or a decrease in the price of flour, it was agreed that no necessity had been shown for any general increase in the bakers&apos; margin. Particular cases of proved hardship could be met by local increases in the price of
the loaf, made by authority of Food Control Committees; and in some cases more economical methods of baking, by combination among the bakers, could be effected. This decision was communicated by the Food Controller to a deputation of the National Association of Master Bakers on February 12th.The Consumers&apos; Council-The Council met on Wednesday, February 12th.The Food Controller, who was present for part of the meeting, laid before the Council the proposals for the early decontrol of tea which had already been under the consideration of the Food Council. The Consumers&apos; Council agreed with the Food Controller^ view that; having regard to the large stocks of tea in the country, the continuance of control would keep up prices and that by releasing control there was a clear prospect of tea being on sale in retailers&apos; shops at prices below the present fixed price; and that during at any rate the next 12 months no difficulties need be anticipated. It was accordingly proposed that the present distribution &quot;system and fixed price should be withdrawn at as early a date as possible.The Director of Meat Supplies explained to the Council the steps which the Ministry hoped to take to introduce a greater element of competition between butchers than existed at present and to allow periodical changes of registration by customers. It was proposed that for the present the schedule of maximum prices should still stand, but the question of making a reduction in the price of imported meat would very shortly come up for consideration.Proposals for decontrolling bacon were laid before the Council, but no final decision was reached.Mr. Coller, who had taken over control of National Kitchens, stated that instead of the present Board of Management it was proposed to set up an Advisory Committee with himself as chairman, of which Dr. Marion Phillips and Mr. Syrett would be members. Reduction in- the staff of this branch of the Ministry had already taken place, and further reductions were in prospect. He hoped to present a full report on the position of affairs in a few weeks&apos; time.Imports Board. It was reported that H.M. Treasury had cancelled credits in all countries for the purchase of oils and oilseeds. Since no exchange will be required for the purchase of Argentine linseed, either on Government or private account, the question, whether credits can now be granted for the purchase of Argentine butter has been resubmitted to H.M. Treasury.Treasury sanction is being requested for the purchase of a further quantity of up to 2,000 tons of butter in U.S.A.; and endeavours are also being made to obtain quantities of secondary butter from,Canada to be used for manufacturing purposes only.Supplies and Distribution.Jam Rationing. As a result of complaints regarding the unequal distribution of jam supplies, and owing to the fact that no increase in the available supplies can be expected until the next jam season, it has been decided to introduce certain changes into the present system of jam rationing and distribution. The new arrangements are as follows : (1) Jam (including jelly and conserve, but excluding lemon and orange marma-lade) can only be sold against coupons. The ration is fixed at 4 ozs. Where retailers have not got sufficient jam to honour all coupons up to 4 ozs. they are to make as equal a distribution as possible of the available supplies among their registered customers, and the balance of the 4-oz. ration is to be made up in marmalade if required. Subject to holding in reserve enough marmalade to make up the jam ration of all authorised customers and establishments in cases where the supply of jam, jelly, and conserve is not sufficient, retailers may sell marmalade up to any reason-able quantity to individual customers and to establishments. Special arrangements are made for a special allotment of jam proper to schools.(2) Establishments, other than schools, may obtain jam up to 25 per cent, of the amount required to supply f- oz. of jam with each breakfast served, TJT oz. with each luncheon and dinner served, and \ oz. for each tea served.,(3) Distribution will continue to be undertaken by jam manufacturers, and retailers will still deal with their present suppliers. Arrangements have been made, however, for a reserve of 1,000 tons of jam per week to be
held in reserve by the manufacturers. The Ministry may call on this reserve to remedy local shortages of good jam, and Jam Distribution Officers will continue to exercise their powers for redressing inequalities of distribution amongst different areas in their Divisions.Bacon- Both consumption and arrivals for this week were normal. Arrangements are being made for the replacement in the United States of America of the 12,000 tons of bacon sold to France. *The Bacon Advisory Committee almost unanimously opposed the proposal put before them for the de-control of lard. The view expressed by them was that, while the Ministry was the holder of the stocks, either entire control should be maintained, as at present, or control, including the maximum retail price, should be completely abolished.In Ireland the Southern Curers have declined to carrv out the wishes of the Ministry with regard to distribution. It has been decided to notify them that the rebate, or bonus at present allowed to them, will be discontinued from the 1st March. It is proposed also to have a meeting of the Irish Curers and English Wholesale Dealers to see if some equitable scheme of distribution can be arranged, in which event the rebate will once again be granted.Milk. Considerable anxiety is felt by farmers generally on the subject of future milk prices ; and the general lack of information on the policy of the Government with regard to the prices and control of milk necessarily tends to unsettle the trade and to influence adversely future production.At a meeting of the Central Milk Advisory Committee held on February 6th, consideration of the future control of milk was postponed until some definite scheme, was laid before them by the Ministry, but it was clearly brought out that, the urgent question of fixing milk prices for the summer and for next winter, on which adequate production depended, was closely linked with the larger question of the continuance of control.A sample of the new 10 gallon standard churn prepared by the Ministry was inspected by the Committee and found general approval.In reply to representations, the Ministry have promised to make supplies of condensed milk available for the confectionery trade as soon as possible in order to allow them to meet the demands made in Great Britain and to re-establish their export trade.Woolwich Arsenal has been instructed to proceed with the manufacture of the first 10,000 standard churns approved by the Ministry at a price of 31s. each.Dried Fruits. The brokers have received instructions to commence the distribu-tion of dried fruits on Monday, February 17th.A steamer has arrived with 4,000 tons of dates. Another is due in a week&apos;s time when it is hoped to make a distribution.Cocoa.-An interim allocation of 2,850 tons is being distributed this week. The shipments and arrivals continue to be very satisfactory and at the end of this month 36,000 tons of raw cocoa, equalling a full six months&apos; supply, will be in this country.The scheme for allowing the export of 25 per cent, of all imports of raw cocoa (providing the remaining 75 per cent, is put into the Distribution Scheme) was unanimously approved by the Cocoa Advisory Committee, and is being put into effect as from February 17th.Coffee. The export of coffee is being allowed more freely. During the last week the licences granted, by the War Trade Department amounted to 233 tons.Oilseeds. The purchase of oilseeds by the Ministry has practically ceased for the last six weeks, and steps are being taken for the liquidation of any surplus stocks.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.The Cattle Feeding Stuffs (Maximum Prices) Amendment Order, 1919, dated 7th February 1919, permits retailers selling millers&apos; offals in quantities of less than 28 lbs. to add \d. instead of \d. per lb. to the maximum price allowed by the Order. It reduces the charges for sacks and bags in the case of millers&apos; offals and other feeding stuffs except cakes and meals.   The Order came into force on 10th February.A Notice, dated 7th February 1919, under the Cattle Feeding Stuffs (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918, varies the price between the fine and the coarse flour millers&apos; offals.   The &quot;fine&quot; remains at 141. 10s. per ton, while the &quot;coarse&quot; is reduced tom. ios.
The following Orders have been revoked wholly or in part as from the 23rd february the Grocery Syrup (Distribution to Manufacturers) Order, 1918. The whole Order is revoked, thus withdrawing the restrictions in dealings in syrup.The Jam and Syrup (Registration of Dealers) Order, 1918, is revoked, so far as it relates to syrup. This abolishes the necessity for the licensing and registration of wholesale and retail dealers.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions reported during the week ending February 1st is 810, of which 757.resulted in convictions. The average fines for England, Scotland, and Wales was 31. 19s. Sd., and for Ireland 4s. id. Prosecutions were reported under 70 different Orders.A sentence of six weeks&apos; imprisonment was passed on E. Edwards, manager of a public-house at Bethnal Green, for diluting beer in cask. On visiting the cellars of the inn, the inspector discovered an ingenious device by means of which water was drawn up through the beer engine.A heavy line amounting to 500L and 38L costs was inflicted on W. Seymour, Ltd., wholesale ham and bacon curers, Mansfield, for having made excessive charges for cooked ham in 100 instances.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.The imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the week ended 8th February (167,300 tons) are again below the average. As compared with the preceding week they show that imports of wheat and flour, meat, and sugar have fallen off by one-third and lard and butter by more than one-half, while less than 50 tons of cheese arrived. On the other hand, there were improved imports of rice (6,900 tons), barley (4,700 tons), oats (8,700 tons), maize (45,800 tons), and cocoa (3,800 tons).The monthly imports of oilseeds, nuts, and kernels for January (153,100 tons), and vegetable oils (12,700 tons) were well above the average. The most noteworthy feature was, however, the import of oilseed cake (19,200 tons), which amounted to nearly twice the entire import for the year .1918 (10,800 tons).. A summary of the principal imports since September is given in the following table : Total Imports for the first 23 weeks of Cereal Year (1st September to 8th February).Increase or Beer erne on 1917-18.f i&apos;       Tons.       jJPcr Cent,i   4-    131,000 i 4-   124!   4-     51,800 1 + 1,0.704-       8,000 I 4-    44- 23,800 -   100- 20,700 : - 35 4-     12,100 ; 4-    26- 150,800 ! - 24 4- 26,200 4- 42 4- 3,000 4- 100 4-     37,200 4-   387Total&apos; -Wheat.

Consumption.Meat. There was a further decrease of 35 per cent. in.home supplies of butchers&apos; meat in Great Britain in the week ended 1st February, largely owing to the withholding of live stock by fanners in anticipation of the higher prices to producers coming into force on the first of the month. On the other hand, the amount of imported meat passing into consumption (10,700 tons) was the highest on record since the inauguration of control. Total consumption continued to fall, the estimated consumption of rationed meats on present information being nearly 20 per cent, below the ration quantity. The addition of meat free from the ration brought the total estimated consumption of all butchers&apos; meat to 18,500 tons, or approximately the quantity to which the public are entitled on the coupons alone. The low rate of consumption in this particular week was no doubt partly clue to the abnormal industrial and transport situation.Flour. The index illustrating the deliveries of Hour from mills and quantities of foreign flour released to agents is continued in Table C (2) for the four weeks ended 1st February. The total for these weeks was 27 per cent, greater than that of the preceding four weeks, and nearly 11 per cent, greater than that of the corresponding period a year ago. Over a period of 12 weeks, hoAvever, the quantity passing into consumption is still 6 per cent, below that of a year ago. The unequal distribution of deliveries this winter has no doubt been due to fluctuations in bakers&apos; stocks associated with the improvement in the quality of the flour. It may be noted further that the modification of the prohibition against hoarding has rendered possible again the accumulation of stores by individual consumers. Thus the high figures quoted in the index for the last month do not imply a corresponding increase in consumption during that period.Army Demands. It should be remembered that as demobilisation proceeds the requirements of the civilian population increase. The demobilisation of a million men is equivalent to an addition of about 2f- per cent, to the civilian requirements. Adjustments have accordingly been made in the estimated figures relating to army and civilian consumption given in Table B (1).Fish. The total landing of fish on the coasts of the United Kingdom during January was 35,000 tons; this may be compared with 26,200 tons in January 1918, and 28,700 tons in January 1917. There were exceptionally heavy landings on the Scottish coasts, including large catches of herrings.The supplies at Billingsgate Market rose to 1,970 tons during the week ended January 25th, as compared with 1,180 tons in the previous week, and reached 2,900 tons in the week ended February 1st. It is interesting to note that the improvement in the January landings in 1919 as compared with 1918 is not reflected in the supplies at this market, the total for the month this year being slightly less than for January 1918.Stocks.The stocks of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs on 1st February 1919 are given in Table D, and compared with those on 1st January 1919, and 1st February 1918. The seasonal reduction of stocks of cereals (including farm stocks) during the month of January has been less than in January 1918, the depletion in the case of wheat and flour being 145,000 tons during January 1919, as compared with a depletion of 216,000 tons a year ago, barley and oats showing similar differences. Sugar stocks fell 37,000 tons during the month, compared with a fall of 25,000 tons during January 1918, though the percentage reduction on the considerably higher current stocks was only 11 per cent., compared with 12 per cent, during January 1918. The stocks of meat, lard, and cheese also decreased during the month, but bacon stocks increased.Generally, the stocks on 1st February are high. Compared with the February stocks in the preceding four years for which records are available, they are highest in the case of wheat, rice, oats, meat, bacon, lard, cheese and sugar; they are, however, less than some of the earlier February stocks in the case of barley, butter, margarine, and tea, while maize stocks are far below the February stocks of earlier years. The principal articles are set out in the following table the maximum February stocks are printed in clarendon type.

For example, the stocks of bacon and lard in the hands of wholesalers on 25th January 1.919 amounted to 16,600 tons of bacon and 2,900 tons of lard, equivalent to an addition to the stocks in importers&apos; warehouses and cold stores of 26 per cent, in the. case of bacon and 10 per cent, in the case of lard.The stocks belonging to the Ministry include the following : bacon, 52,200 tons ;&apos; lard, 26,20.0 tons; rabbits, 270 tons; canned meat, 15,000 tons; condensed milk, 18,700 tons, and butter 12,000 tons.   For the most part they are included in the stocks in importers&apos; warehouses and cold stores, but they also include goods in transit.Prices.The records of the Department of Labour Statistics show the average retail prices of the principal foodstuffs consumed by the working classes as being practi-cally the same on 1st February as on 1st January, namely, 130 per cent, above those obtaining in July 1914. Any variations in the prices of the individual articles were merely fractional-the trend, being upwards in the case of milk and potatoes and downwards in the case of eggs (Table E) condensed milk, split peas, sago and tapioca (Table F).The wholesale price of Egyptian cotton seed is recorded as having fallen from 480s. to 395s. a ton.b S
