Although much of the material is readily available, it will take some days before the answers can be completed.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Uth February, 1919.C.I.G.S.Will you please supply me, for the information of the Cabinet, with the answers which the General Staff give to the following questions. In giving these answers you are entitled to assume (a.) That the Principo Conference will not take place and that the Allied Govern -ments will instead make a united appeal to all loyal Russians to exert themselves to the utmost against the Bolsheviks ;(6.) That no troops can be sent from this country by compulsion to carry on the war in Russia.As a variant to both (a) and (b), you should also assume that all the great Allied Powers, except the United States, agree in (a).Questions.1. Within the limits aforesaid, what means are there of aiding the Russian armies to wage war upon the Bolsheviks ?2. What are the actual measures which the General Staff would propose, generally and in each of the theatres ?   (But see also hereunder.)3. What numbers of non-Russian soldiers, and particularly of British soldiers, would be required ?4. At what do you estimate the cost (a.) Of obtaining and maintaining the British personnel;(6.) Of maintaining the Russian armies that are in the field or are required to be raised ?With regard to Question 2, the following points of detail arise : &apos;(a.) Ought we to evacuate Murmansk and Archangel, and if so, when and how ?(6.) What assistance can be given by the British Fleet and Army to the Esthonians and the Finns, and what other means are there of bringing them aid ?(c.) In what way is Poland to be aided ? Should it be assigned to the French ? What is to be done with General Hallers army ? If it should be sent to Poland, what steps are necessary to secure its prompt arrival ? What are the causes of delay, and what should we do to remove them ?(d) What is the r61e of the French, Greek and Roumanian troops at or in the neighbourhood of Odessa? Could they be employed elsewhere with advantage ? Could they, or any part of them, be exchanged with British troops in the Dobruja ? Would this be wise ? Are there other more useful spheres of employment open to the French. Greek and Roumanian troops in &quot; this area ?(e.) What is the present situation of General Denekin&apos;s army, including that of General Krasnoff ?Would it be better for the French, Greek and Roumanian troops at and in the neighbourhood of Odessa to proceed directly to his aid ? What aid does he require ? What are we doing to help him ? Is there anything more that we can do ?(B19/102)   50   ;&apos;/19  HAS   6865wo
(/.) What is the precise r61e and present situation of the British forces holding the Batoum Baku railway, and of the British naval forces holding the Caspian Sea? -   -   &apos;Could these forces be more usefully employed elsewhere ?To what extent are they aiding General Denekins Army by their presence ? . V. /.&apos;-:--...&apos;.............   :. -Could they aid it in any more direct manner,.!?:&apos;&apos;.&apos;, : / , .Would advantage result from reinforcing them with the remaining British troops in the Dobruja ?Would it be contrary to British interests and would it be in accordance with your general scheme to entrust the custody of this railway to two Italian divisions ?Is there any reason to believe that the Italians are willing to under -take this ?(g.) How far is our Trans-Caspian force dependent upon the Batoum Baku railroad and the command of the Caspian ?What would happen to it if this line were sacrificed ?

What measures do you suggest to increase and animate the Russian and Turkoman forces available for fighting the Bolsheviks in this theatre ? To what extent do you consider Indian interests involved ?(h.) What is your policy for Siberia ?Is it contrary to British interests that the Omsk Government should (a) against our will, and (b) with our encouragement, come to terms with the Japanese in order to procure effective Japanese intervention in Western Siberia ?In what form and to what extent could British aid be given to the Omsk Government with 10 or 12 thousand volunteers employed in technical offensive services of the highest order ?When would these be needed ?When do you think they could be supplied ?What arrangements do you recommend to improve the working of the Siberian Railway?How would you propose to relieve the British units now compulsorily employed in this theatre and to replace them by volunteers ?What course do you propose to take about the Canadians at Vladivostock ?&apos; Are they any use ?
