The opinion of the Labour Press on the Peace Conference, with special reference to the League of Nations and the Berne Conference; on Foreign Affairs; on Home Affairs, with special reference to the recent Strikes and the King&apos;s Speech, is described.(2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Discharge.Part IV: General Topics and District Reports.(1) General. The Demands of the Triple Alliance are referred to.(2) District Reports. Labour Unrest has subsided somewhat since last week.Part V: Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.

General Kemarks.Certain Considerations with Regard to the Present Industrial Unrest.It was suggested in this Report two weeks ago that the variety and triviality of the causes of the present outbreaks point to the existence of a large mass of inarticulate discontent, which affords an opportunity to those who desire it to exploit industrial strife for political ends. There are a number of reasons why this should be so which have already received notice. From the point of view of the individual monotony beyond a certain point always becomes unpleasant, especially when possible ways of breaking it present any attractive features. The effect of this in regard to strikes has long been recognised ; hot weather, making the usual routine appear particularly unattractive, has frequently played its part in bringing men out. The individual workman at the present moment is undoubtedly extremely susceptible to this kind of force. After some four years of hard routine with hardly a break, it is no wonder that a strike sounds attractive, entirely irrespective of its merits or demerits, and from a point of view which receives in general no consideration in the course of formal &quot; negotiati6ns.&quot;(C 1676)   130  2/19  h &amp; s
This feeling, though a small thing when considered from the individual point of view, becomes of importance when considered as regards its effect on large masses ; and it may-have very serious consequences in connection with the difficult problems which are only now beginning to come up for solution. It is true that the actual precipitation of a conflict at once acts as a safety valve to such a force, but the danger is that its presence at the outset may give rise to unforeseen developments, which will have the most serious consequences after that which produced them has ceased to exist. As has been very clearly proved by past experience, the satisfactory solution of industrial problems depends very largely on the general attitude of the contending parties, especially at the outset. It is quite possible, for example, that the miners, acting partly under this stimulus, may now embark on a path which will produce a situation which in the mass they neither foresee nor desire. Another point of importance is that in so far as such a feeling of discontent is present, the concession of workpeople&apos;s demands is actually no solvent of the difficulty, but has a tendency merely to lead to further demands. Here again the action of the miners in rejecting out of hand the Governments reply to their programme is suggestive.Unfortunately, at the present time there would appear to be a number of other factors in the situation of a nature which would tend to reinforce and give the colour of reason to actions dictated by such a feeling as that referred to. There has been an inter-ruption of the normal processes of collective bargaining for four years. Normally employers and workpeople meet for the purpose of negotiation with the knowledge that a failure to reach a settlement will involve a strike or a lock-out. They meet frequently, and have abundant opportunities of measuring each others&apos; strength and gauging the probable results of a contest. The result is that a settlement is usually reached that fairly represents the balance of the forces in conflict. During the war the need and the opportunities for this mutual observation have been removed, and the majority of work-people and employers are uncertain what claims they can exact and how much they must concede. The adjustment of wages and industrial conditions was effected during the war, in the main successfully, by conciliation and compulsory arbitration. But the very success of the conciliatory activities of Government departments and arbitration tribunals relieved workpeople and employers of their normal responsibility for industrial peace, and so contributed to their present uncertainty. Now that the war is ended the stronger elements among the employers, and more especially among the workpeople, are no longer prepared to accept the results of arbitration as equivalent to the results which unfettered collective bargaining, backed by the threat of lock-out or strike, might give. Uncertainty as to their strength has thus acted as the opportunity of the more aggressive or optimistic spirits to push their ideas into the foreground and precipitate an open trial of strength.The four years&apos; industrial truce, however, was not unbroken, and the breaches that occurred had the general effect of leading the workpeople in the great pivotal industries at any rate to place a high estimate on their economic bargaining strength. While their leaders generally realise that this strength was largely due to the exceptional labour shortage of the war period, the rank and file have gained a confidence in themselves that remains when the conditions have changed. It is partly this confidence that has made it so easy to organise &quot; unofficial &quot; strikes, and it is impossible to demonstrate either that it is justified or unjustified until it has been put to the test by a struggle in which the Government does not intervene. The same interruption of normal experience is a factor in the relations of the rank and file of the unions with their official leaders. Normally, with a strike an- ever-present possibility, the official leaders can be relied on to maintain the most intimate contact with the forces they may have to lead. During the war, not only has this been impossible, as has already been pointed out, through the leading trade union officials having been engaged very largely in negotiations with the Government, but the embargo on strikes has removed the pressure that normally ensures contact of this character. The postponement on account of the war of trade union elections, con-ferences for the revision of rules, and the like, has contributed to this divergence ; and meanwhile the rank and file, owing to the general shortage of labour, have been able, with considerable success, to press their claims without the support of their leaders. It may be doubted whether the importance of discipline and unity will be realised until normal collective bargaining is renewed and the industrial workman is made to feel again his dependence on a properly organised trade union.One other feature in all the unofficial strikes differentiates them from most pre-war disputes. This is the attempt to compel Government intervention. In many cases little account is taken of the employers&apos; powers of resistance ; in the case of the Clyde strike, the employers were not even requested to consider the strikers&apos; claim before the strike was declared. Before the war such strikes, where they occurred, were confined to a narrow
orange of &quot; essential &quot; industries, but during the war the number of essential industries, in which any stoppage became a public danger, greatly increased, and it would seem that a new habit of mind was formed, which is influencing action after the conditions that gave rise to it have passed away.These factors in the problem, taken in conjunction with the general discontent referred to already, suggest that Government intervention, even if it succeeds in effecting a satis-factory settlement of the claims on which the strikes are ostensibly based, may not always entirely remove the unrest of which the strikes.are an expression. So far as the unrest is a protest against unsatisfactory social conditions in general, it can be allayed only by a general policy of social reform such as the Prime Minister has outlined. So far as it is the outcome of uncertainty, or is based upon want of realisation of the change of con-ditions which have recently taken place as a result of the termination of hostilities, the main factor in its removal would appear to be a return to the normal procedure of conciliation, voluntary arbitration and, in the last resort, the strike.The enquiries directed to the discovery of specific grievances undertaken by Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Clyde Commission in 1915 and by the Commission on Industrial Unrest in 1917, by inviting general discussion and at the same time compelling the formu-lation of actual grievances, discharged much of the electricity in the air at the time, and revealed that the workpeople were apt to strike against what they regard as evils, without considering whether the employers against whom they struck were either responsible for or had it in their power to remove them. Investigations of a similar character, or covering similar ground, at the present time may indicate a similar state of affairs, though the problems to be faced in the present case are undoubtedly of a more complex character than was the case previously.Part II.--Demobilisation and Resettlement.Unemployment among Demobilised Men.Demobilisation. The total number of men serving in the British Armies, including the Royal Air Force, at the date of the armistice may be given in round numbers as 3,833,000, exclusive of officers. The number of men in the Navy may be put approximately at 360,000, also exclusive of officers.On 6th February, about 1,180,000 men, or 31 per cent, of the Army and Air Force had been demobilised, and 73,000, or 20 per cent, of the men in the Navy. The size of the Armies of Occupation, including the Royal Air Force, has been announced by the Secretary of State for War as approximately 1,000,000 men. There remained therefore, on 6th February, a further total of approximately 1,650,000 men from the Army and the Air Force to be placed again in civil life.Unemployment. The number of soldiers and airmen out of employment on 7th February may be taken as corresponding approximately with the number whose out-of-work donation policies remain lodged on that date in round numbers 61,400. It must be remembered, however, that on demobilisation, the soldier is given furlough, with pay, for. 28 days, during which time his out-of-work donation policy is not available. To obtain a rough estimate, therefore, of the proportion of demobilised soldiers out of work on 7th February, this total of 61,400 may best be compared with the total of 391,000 men who had been demobilised on 9th January, or approximately a month before. On this basis, it appears that a little under 16 per cent, of the demobilised men entitled to claim the out-of-work donation were receiving it on 7th February.* Ori the same basis of calculation, the number of sailors receiving unemployment donation on 7th February  roughly 1,900 represents a rather higher proportion (a little over 16 per cent.) of those eligible for unemployment donation on that date.If these proportions remain constant, when demobilisation, save for the Armies of Occupation, has been completed, then out of 2,833,000 men released some 450,000 will be receiving out-of-work donation. To these must be added about the same proportion of the number by which naval strength is reduced. It does not appear probable that the proportion is likely to diminish. The bulk of the men eligible for the donation on 7th February were demobilised before the pace of release had been quickened to its present rate. In the period from the armistice to 9th January, about 411,000 officers and men from all forces were demobilised, while in the four weeks ending 6th February, the number* A similar calculation, based on the number of demobilised men on the 26th December and those receiving out-of-work donation on the 24th January, gives a percentage of a little over 17.(01676) A 2
exceeded 871,000.  In the absence of a very rapid expansion of industry, the pressure on the labour market must have been greater during the latter period than in the former.*Pivotal Men. Strong complaints continue to be received from all parts of the United Kingdom about the delay in the release of pivotal men from the Army. Repre-sentations have been made to the War Office but there is no visible improvement in the rate of release. The position as to officers who have been applied for as pivotal or on special grounds is particularly unsatisfactory. This delay is a considerable factor in the continuance and increase of unemployment.   .General Unemployment.Extent and Increase. On Friday, 7th February, the most recent date for which com-plete statistics are available, the number of out-of-work donation policies remaining lodged at the employment exchanges was, in round figures, 734,100.f The week&apos;s increase was approximately 55,000, a considerable decline from the 88,000 of the previous week. Despite fluctuations, however, there have been few encouraging signs of any substantial slackening in the rate of increase. Since 13th December, the average weekly increase has been about 67,000. If Ireland, where exceptional circumstances prevail, is excluded, the number of unemployment policies lodged for Great Britain on 7th February was 667,000, and the average weekly increase for the preceding eight weeks was about 60,000.$Men and Women. The total of 667,000 comprises about 215,000 men and 404,000 women, the remainder including boys and girls in almost equal proportions. The rough proportion of one man to two women drawing out-of-work donation has held good for some time past, but is slowly increasing.Districts. A comparison with the sugar-buying population in the employment exchange divisions throws light upon unemployment in various localities. A little over 31 per 10,000 were unemployed in Great Britain on 6th December. On 7th February, the number was 172 per 10,000. The weekly increase in the interval has oscillated between limits of 19 and 12 per 10,000. The highest level of unemployment is in the West Midlands division, where the proportion is over twice the average for Great Britain, and in the North-Western division, where it is nearly one and a-half times the average. In the South Midlands and Eastern division, the South-Western division and Wales it is only a little over half the average. There are, however, very great local variations. The Accrington Exchange area shows a total of 1,003 unemployed per 10,000 of the sugar-buying population. The rate in London is 188 per 10,000 ; the Leeds rate is 260 ; the Sheffield rate 236 ; the Glasgow rate 295 ; and the Birmingham rate 362.Industries. Unemployment in the industries insured under the Acts of 1911 and 1916 averaged a little over 10 per cent, on 7th February. There is some indication that, relatively to the uninsured trades, the pressure in the insured industries is diminishing, but absolutely it is still increasing. The most notable variation in recent weeks has been a rapid and continuous increase of unemployment in the building trades. The level of, unemployment among builders (8*24 per cent.), however, is still considerably below that in engineering and ironfounding (13*25 per cent.), while the industries classed under the heading &quot; Ammunition&quot; show a percentage of 21 &quot;4.Duration of Unemployment. The out-of-work donation scheme has been in operation for a sufficient time to enable some estimate to be given of the numbers who are Hearing the term of 13 weeks for which the donation can be drawn. Of the round total of 700,000 policies on which,payments were made in the week ending 7th February, a little more than 58 per cent, had exhausted from 1 to 30 days of the 13 weeks, a little more than 27 per cent, from 31 to 48 days, and about 14 per cent, from 49 to 60 days. The position in this respect is markedly worse for women than for men. Of the women, 17 per cent, had drawn donation for a period ranging from 49 to 60 days, as against 9 * 3 per cent, of civilian men and 12 per cent, of men from the forces, while 30*7 per cent, had drawn it for a period ranging from 31 to 48 days as against 23 * 7 per cent, of civilian men, and 21 per cent, of men from.the forces.* On the 6th February, the number of Army officers demobilised was about 27,500, of a total of approxi-mately 193,000, and the number of Naval officers 2,800 of a round total of 38,000. It is not possible to estimate the extent of unemployment among these officers. In the case, however, of the younger members, it is likely to be extensive for some time. They have received a higher rate of payment than would be obtained at a corresponding age in pre-war employment, and are not unnaturally loath to accept lower rates.f Including members of H.M. Forces, the women&apos;s auxiliary corps, boys and girls.I Not all of those who are drawing unemployment donation are wholly unemployed. Where the working of short time has been systematised and employees are thrown idle periodically at short intervals, provision is made for admitting them to participate in the benefits of the donation under certain conditions.
Part III. Press Comments. (1) Labour and Socialist Press.(A) Peace Conference.The Labour papers on the whole take a depressing view of the Peace Conference this week. Mr. Ponsonby, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; considers that the promise for open diplomacy has been evaded since the plenary sessions to which the Press were to be admitted are now discovered to be hardly ever held. &quot; Justice &quot; finds fault with the Conference for debating the League of Nations to the exclusion of the terms to be presented to the Central Powers, and considers that President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George are responsible for this unsatisfactory situation.League of Nations.It is on the subject of the League of Nations that the papers are least hopeful. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; British Citizen &quot; emphasise the fact that European countries are by no means unanimous in their desire for a League of Nations. The &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; criticise the proposed Constitution of the League. The &quot; Herald &quot; says that Labour is not going to be satisfied with a hybrid between a Conference of dip-lomats and a Holy Alliance of the Big Powers. It demands a League composed of repre-sentatives elected by the Parliaments of each nation, and also that the draft scheme should be discussed by the various Parliaments before it is adopted. In the opinion of Mr. Ponsonby (.&quot; Labour Leader &quot;) it would be a mistake to lay down in detail the organisation, constitution, and powers of the League from the very first, since this might render the chance of failure more likely.The Paris Labour Commission.The &quot; Call &quot; thinks the real aim of the Paris Labour Commission is to strengthen the ties between Governments the more effectively to deal with Labour when it becomes unruly. It holds the idea of International Labour Legislation to he a futile one. For example, the British miner who is about to demand a 30-hour week will not hold his hand until Governments present a Bill giving shorter hours to the Rumanian peasant.The Berne Conference.The I.L.P. papers continue to support the Conference. George Lansbury in the &quot; Herald &quot; notices the universal faith in President Wilson. Sympathy is also expressed for the Bolsheviks although great opposition to their methods at the same time exists. Regarding its attitude towards the League of Nations, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks the Internationale has formulated the right scheme, and rejoices that it should have so definitely declared itself in favour of the total abolition of standing armies. &quot; Forward &quot; notes that the English delegates were anxious to get on with the business of the League of Nations, but that the French wanted to waste time arguing the question of the responsi-bility for the war; &quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand, blames the Conference for shelving this latter question.In the opinion of the &quot; Call &quot; and the ff Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; the Conference is a parody of the Social Internationale. The &quot; Call&quot; notes that neither the Swiss, the Italian, nor the real Socialist Parties of England or Russia are represented ; and the &quot; Workers&quot; Dreadnought&quot; considers it merely a conference of Reformists, who may believe in Socialism but will not work for it directly in our time. The Conference has disgraced itself by passing a resolution condemning the world&apos;s first Socialist Government, and the &quot; Call&quot; adds under these circumstances it is ironical that the Conference should appoint a Commission of Enquiry into the effects of Russian Bolshevism.George Lansbury, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; finds that England is far behind hand in the questions of hours. In Germany, Bohemia and Hungary an 8-hour day has already been established, and bills dealing with this question are before the Parliaments of several other countries. On the subject of strikes the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; suggests the sinister possibility that the Labour leaders may be prepared to agree to legislation, making strikes illegal under certain conditions.(B) Foreign Affairs.The New German Government.Very varied conclusions are drawn from the report of the first meeting of the German Government. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that Ebert&apos;s speech clearly intimated that the German Republic would resist the imposition of crushing indemnities enforced by an Army of Occupation.  The overthrow of Kaiserism being achieved there is no justification(C 1676) A 3
for making the task of the Republic more difficult. According to &quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand, the speech plainly shows that the German people still regard themselves as militarily undefeated. The composition of the new Government leads the &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought &quot; to think that Germany is far from having accomplished the Social Revolution.Russia.The &quot; Herald &quot; reports that attempts to overthrow the Prinkipo proposal do not abate, especially on the part of the French. Nothing appears to annoy the French Chauvinists more than the evidence of a conciliatory disposition at Moscow. It again draws attention to the fact that by starving Russia we are perpetuating anarchy and civil war.(G)-Eome Affairs.The Strikes and Trade Unionism.The Labour papers acknowledge that the strikes have failed, and ascribe this mainly to the want of unity of action. The reluctance on the part of the majority of the workers to join the strikers is attributed by the &quot;Herald &quot; to the fact that the Triple Alliance has just presented their demands to the Government, and a stoppage by those unions would form the best rallying point for the whole of Labour; while a concession, without a strike, of their demands would ensure success to Labour all along the line. Among the many obstacles that the engineers had to face the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; includes the knowledge that employers &quot; were prepared to wait through the trade slump till the beaten men should come back to beg for work on any terms.&quot; According to &quot; Justice &quot; the strike weapon should only be used when all other means fail, and then only under responsible direction. The &quot; British Citizen&quot; prints the manifesto of the National Democratic and Labour Party, which strongly deprecates the action of the extremist elements in their abuse of the strike weapon, and believes that the movement is promoted and in some cases subsidised by the agents of Bolshevism.The A.S.E. are severely blamed by the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; ; by the first for having suspended its local officials in Belfast, Glasgow, and London, and by the second, for adopting the &quot; terrible policy of absolute materialism.&quot; The trade union officials are. said to be fearful of the results of a revolution, and therefore material interest ranged them on the side of Capitalism.Mr. H. M. Hyndman in &quot;Justice&quot; expounds the claim for State ownership as the only way to avert anarchy.Official Labour Leaders.The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer&quot; write bitterly of Labour men such as Mr. G. H. Roberts and Mr. Appleton, who appear to be taking the side of the Capitalists when they argue that &quot; more cannot be taken out of industry than is produced within it.&quot; The papers reiterate the workers&apos; argument that what,they want is a much larger share of what is produced. The &quot; Call&quot; alludes to Mr. Thomas&apos;s argument that citizenship has a stronger claim than the interests of a mere section of workers. He does not take into account the fact that the.public care little about the welfare of the railway workers, and that nothing which these workers have gained during the war was gained except by determination to resist the burden of high prices.Army Unrest.Certain of the papers give prominence to the alleged unrest in the Army.. The &quot; Herald &quot; and. the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; mention the three weeks&apos; strike at Kempton Park and other places. The &quot; Herald &quot; asks various questions of Mr. Churchill.; Among them it wishes to know the truth regarding these &quot; strikes,&quot; and whether there was similar disaffection at Calais.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; announces the formation of a Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Union, the President of which is Captain Donnisthorpe. The &quot;Call&quot; appeals to organised Labour to support the soldiers in their attempts at organisation, lest they should alienate their sympathy and support in the class struggle. It reminds the rulers that the soldier is no longer the will-less automaton of yesterday but a &quot; civie&quot; in khaki.
Part IV.-General Topics and District&quot; Reports.(A). General.Demands of the Triple Alliance.The Railwaymen, Miners and Transport Workers have recently&quot;formulated important demands, and their apparent determination to stand by these and make no concessions has aroused general anxiety. The railwaymen&apos;s demands were discussed in detail in the Report for the week ending 5th February. The miners&apos; demands were similarly discussed in the Report of 22nd January. The Conference of the M.F.G.B., sitting at Southport on 13th February, decided to take a national ballot on the question of a strike to enforce their demands. The result of the ballot is to be declared on 22nd February, and if a two-thirds majority is secured, the strike will begin on 15th March.Several of the daily papers, including the &quot; Times,&quot; the &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; and the &quot; Daily Chronicle &quot; think the result of the ballot is practically a foregone conclusion, since the Federation leaders are not likely to have taken any risks, and these are confident that the requisite two-thirds majority will be obtained.  Among the comments appearingWhitley Councils.Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; doubts whether a new spirit will manifest itself in the Whitley Councils; he asks what is to come to their aid if employers and employed fail to agree, when the Councils are independent of Government assistance ? He bases his doubts on the experience he gained at the National Maritime Board, where the shipowners, gaining untaxed fortunes every week, fought the officers and men line byline.The King&apos;s Speech.The King&apos;s speech is not received with enthusiasm, the papers raising objections to various points. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; considers that the phrase about Unemployment exhibits the weakness of the entire speech. It is to be &quot; diminished &quot; and &quot; mitigated,&quot; but that was done by &quot; kind-hearted employers and soup-givers &quot; in the old era which has died out. The allusions to social reform are described as rhetoric ; and the &quot; Herald &quot; asserts that &quot; security of property &quot; cannot be maintained at the same time with a more equitable distribution of leisure and prosperity. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; thinks the speech promised a brave programme of legislation, but as it is over-weighted, it is unlikely that this Parliament will be able to carry through half of it. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; also fears the Government is setting up, by back-stair methods, a sinister system of protection which accounts for the continuance of high prices in this country; and it is of opinion that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech disclosed the fact that he has no policy on which to reconstruct, but will allow himself and reconstruction to drift.(2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Little reference is made again this week to the subject of demobilisation in the daily press.Demobilisation.The &quot; Daily News &quot; (15th February) states that from the date of the armistice to 13th February 34,175 officers and 1,377,761 other ranks have been demobilised.At a conference on the question of demobilisation and resettlement, called by the Edinburgh and District Trades Council on 8th February, it was stated (reports the &quot; Glasgow Herald,&quot; 10th February) that 19,000 men were being demobilised.in Scotland every week, and it was impossible for industry to absorb so many.The &quot; Birmingham Post&quot; (12th February) announces that 500 men who have had legs amputated have been trained in diamond cutting. Two large factories, employing 1,500 men, will shortly be opened at Brighton. At St. Dunstan&apos;s, says the &quot; West-minster Gazette &quot; (14th February) 7,939 disabled soldiers, including 669 blind ones, are now being trained.
in the press several papers remark on the shifting of the Conference from London to Southport, the &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; suggesting that this &quot; means a divorce on the part of the miners between Parliamentary and Trade Union action.&quot; The &quot; Manchester Guardian&quot; is inclined to condemn the miners in their rejection of the Government&apos;s offer ; it warns them that no strike has ever been successful which has not had the moral support of the public.The National Federation of Transport Workers is demanding a 44-hour week of five days of eight hours each, with a mid-day stoppage on Saturday ; in no circumstances shall there be a reduction in existing wages. Shorter hours have already been secured by agreement for carmen and other road transport workers; a similar concession will probably be granted to omnibus and tramway drivers. The Port of London Authority, however, refuse to grant it to dock and riverside workers. The proposal of the Labour Ministry to refer this latter dispute to arbitration has been accepted by all port employers, including the Port of London Authority ; the Transport Worker&apos;s Federation has agreed to a fortnight&apos;s adjournment of the negotiations. They are still opposed, however, to arbitration.Other Demands.Negotiations between employers and operatives in the cotton trade on the 44-hour week began on 17th February at Manchester. The Building Trade operatives have applied to the Master Builders&apos; Federation for a 44-hour week.Suspension of A.S.E. District Secretaries.As a result of the unofficial strikes for a 44-hour week in Glasgow, Belfast and London, the Executive Council of the A.S.E. has suspended the President and those members of these three District Committees who voted in favour of taking unofficial action ; they are precluded from holding any office in the society for a period of two years. In their Monthly Report for February the A.S.E. justify their action by stating that, although during the war it was necessary to deal leniently with those responsible for unofficial action, it is now imperative that the Trade Union should make a stand if the rule of majorities and constitutional procedure is to be preserved.Joint Industrial Councils.The&apos; subject of the abolition of night work in bakeries is now under discussion by a sub-committee of the Bakery Joint Industrial Council. The opposition of the London Master Bakers&apos; Protection Society and the Incorporated Society to any restriction is the chief impediment to a settlement being reached. The Council for the Building Trade has, with the full consent of both operatives and employers, appointed a Committee to consider the question of11 Scientific management and reduction of costs,&quot; with a view to improving the efficiency of the building industry.The Minister of Labour intends to make a special Order applying the Trade Boards Acts to the Laundry Trade.(B) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Since the collapse of the Electrical Trade Union&apos;s strike this district has been quiet. The Woolwich Shop Stewards are reported to have sent two representatives to enquire into the dispute on the North-East Coast with a view to co-ordination on a national basis.West Midlands.The situation is quiet in this district.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Conditions are at the moment satisfactory in this district. The Nottinghamshire miners by a large majority have expressed themselves&apos;in favour of suspending strike notices in connection with the dispute concerning the substitution of shovels for forks.North-western.During the past week the Mersey Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation made vain attempts to obtain a 44-hour week from the employers. The Chairman of the Employers&apos; Association considered that a 47-hour week was a reasonable concession and that it had not had a fair trial. The Trades Federation decided to hold a ballot on the question.   This resulted in a majority voting for a 44-hour week (as opposed to a 40-hour
week), and for remaining at work while negotiations proceeded. It is reported from Southport that many of the older men at the Miners&apos; Conference feel that the meeting should have been held in London, and that Southport was chosen by the extremists expressly to exclude certain of the Miners&apos; Parliamentary representatives.Northern.The situation remains the same on the North-East Coast. South Wales.A meeting of Cardiff and district railwaymen was held at Cardiff on 9th February? when a resolution was passed demanding a 47-hour week, to include meal times. It was agreed to defer direct action pending negotiations, but the Railwaymen&apos;s Executive was urged to declare a national strike if other items in their National programme were not conceded. It is reported that the miners at Pontypridd have decided to vote on 19th February in favour of a national strike.Scotland.The large majority of the men recently on strike in the Clyde area have now returned to work.
