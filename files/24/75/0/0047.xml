Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P,, 10, Downing Street&apos;^, S .^r. 1. &apos;Sir,pre-war and Early War ContractsI am desired by the Executive council of the Federation of British Industries to ask you whether you will be so kind as to receive an influential deputation of its members to lay before you the very serious position of several of the industries of the country in regard to their pre-war and Early War ContractsThe facts disclosed at a meeting of the Executive Council to-day presented the matter as of extreme urgency, and pro-posals were- unanimously passed in the terms of the following resolutionsIn regard to Pre-war or Early war Contracts where owing to war conditions and consequent Government action it has not been possible for contractors to fulfil their obligations, it should be recognised that it is in the National interests of the country that such contracts should now be completed at the priceo agreed upon, if a compromise cannot be reached, more especially having regard to the extreme desirability for the maintenance of good and friendly relations between British manufacturers and foreign customers. It is therefore strongly recommended that :*(l)   In cases where it can be shown that no understanding or compromise dan be arrived at as between the contraotor and the purchaser as regards tversea contracts, it shoJLl be accepted that the whole lose incurred in thecomple-tion of the contract owin* to the change in conditions or to the increase in the oost of manufacture should be Admitted as a rebate from any E.P.D. which may have been paid; or in oases of firms who may not have earned any or sufficient E.P.I).i compensation for such loss shall be made by the Government.(2)   That in cases where contracts have already been com-pleted at a loss, owing to Government action, such loss should be reimbursed in a similar manner.(3)   That in cases which have suffered or will suffer some measure of loss through the liu fulfilment of oontracts&apos; as the result of compromise be-cween the parties, the same relief should be given.
(Sgd.)   V, CAILLAKD,president.(4)   That a special Tribunal be- appointed to consider individual cases, with power to adjudicate on the merits of each claim submitted for admission to the benefits above referred to.&quot;I should mention that a deputation from one industry gravely affected has&apos; already made representations to the Board of Trade, which were sympathetically reteived, but it became evident at the interview that in view of the great urgency of action bein.- taken immediately it would be necessary to place the facts before you personally without delay.The Federation, therefore, while fully appreciating the pressing demands upon your time at the present critical period, greatly hopes that the urgency of the matter in question will enable you to accede to its request to receive a deputation to lay the full case before you.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,
