The Treasury . representative dissented from the view that a separate new Department was necessary.The Commit tee18 recommendation was not favourably received :/ by the Boards of Agriculture, the Scottish Board being partioular-ly hostile;   and the Ministry of Reconstruction submitted a memorandum to the War Cabinet deprecating the formation of a new Central Body,, and suggesting a special forestry section within the Development Commission.The War Cabinet then requested Lord Milner (subsequently Lord Curzon) and Mr.Barnest to &quot;investigate the matter;   and they reported in favour of a Central Authority as recommended by the Afforestation Committee,; (tJtough they were&apos;willing to contemplate the formation&quot; of a semi-independent Forestry Branch wrchin the Development Commission aa. a second best solution)-The report submitted by Lord Curzon and Mr,Barnes was finally approved by the War Cabinet who decided that an independent Central Authority should be set up   emphasising the necessity for the provision of funds and commencement of planting at an early date.- The necessary legislation was to be. carried through ae soon possible.In.the meanwhile, Mr. Acland was to submit proposals to the Treasury for taking.such immediate action, in advance of-legiel&amp;tion, as was required.He advocated the setting up of an Interim Authority to earry on the necessary work of provision of seeds, planting out in nurseries, and the beginning of a planting programme, pending legislation;   Interim Commissioners to be appointed and funds assigned.&apos;Sines the setting up of such an authority might have appear-ed te prejudge the case for a Central Authority, before the House had had an opportunity of criticism, a special decision of the War Cabinet waa sought.The War Cabinet on ?th November approved the setting up of such Authority, which should work in close touch with the Departments concerned;   and the Interim Authority wae accordingly constituted.On the introduction of a Supplementary, Estimate to supply the Interim Authority with funds, the new Authority wae discussed in a very thin house;   and the resolution embodying the grant carried by 44 Votes to 11.  -
106The Interim Authority now urge (a) that it is doubtful when legislation will Ultimately be obtained for setting up the Permanent Authority (b)- that applications for employment are coming in in large numbers and provisional offers of land are being received;   (c) that existing forestry officers are returning from the war whom it is desirable to secure for service under the Authority;   and that th^se considerations render it necessary to make appointments of Assistant Commissioners and Divisional Officers etc. to the&quot; staff of the Authority now. in accordance with.the organisation sketched out by the Committee for the future Forest Authority;   They protest that they will enter into no permanent commitment either as regards staff or as regards purchase of land.The difficulty of such a course is that it nevertheless amounts practically to constituting th* permanent Central Authority and transferring to it the powers at present exercised by the Board of Agriculture and the Development Commission   before any such body has received the approval of the House of Commons.The question for decision is therefore whether the Interim Authority may proceed to appoint officers even upon a theoretically temporary basis upon the lines recommended f-or a Permanent Forest Authority and commence to carry on the approved afforestation policy prior to the approval of Parliament to the setting up of&apos; such Permanent Authority,Treasury,14th February, 1919.
