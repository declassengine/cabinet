Interim NotowPrime Minister.^Rehabilitation of Trade and Provision of Erriployraent.Reference:- Minutes Conference of Ministers 17th February, 1919.I have begun the examination of the trade and employment situations.    They are both badt    The reasons for this are complex and my appreciation of them will form the subject of a report which I hope to present at an early date.    Already, however, it is apparent that work$y of the difficulties by which we are faced have their root in inconsistent policies which are finding expression In executive acts or in recommendations for . executive action.It appears to me essential that all Ministers should subscribe to a common policy and that all executive action should be illuminated by it.The four main lines of policy that I have recognised are:-1*   The orthodox financial (gold standard) policy.2.   The Federation of British Industries (back to 1914) trade policy,3.   The social (better Britain) policy.4.   The Imperial Policy.These are subject to endless permutations and combinations in varying fractions.The orthodox financial policy naturally finds its most numerous supporters in the Treasury. .   It would undoubtedly be a sound policy if the one ambition of ,the Government were to return to the gold standard at the earliest possible date.     It involves immediate reduction of State expenditure to the lowest possible
level with a view to payment of the debt, deflation of the currency and a return to the 1914 standard in the purchasing power of money-    This is a most doubtful  -policy for the State to adopt In view of the huge volume of the indebtedness it incurred at war values.The &quot;back to 1914&quot; trade policy aims at the speediest possible return to the precise pre-war conditions of trade, the State carrying all burdens and making good all losses resulting from the war*   This policy Is clearly indicated In several communications received from the Federation of British Industries (See especially G.-T.6847) and is quite as incompatible with the financial policy as it is with the social and imperial policiesoThe social pdlicy inspires the announced health programme of the Government, the Housing scheme, the development of education, land settlement and ways and communications.   It requires that the State shall freely invest large sums of capital in improvements which will give an indirect return In the future and in the meantime seeks to find employment for vast numbers of persons on State works.The &quot;Imperial&quot; policy regards the empire as an undeveloped unit of which the United Kingdom forms the industrial nucleus.   It compares our position to-day with that of the United States 70 or 80 years ago, and demands migration of population within the empire on a great scale0 So long as Ministers and Departments are inspired by these policies in varying degrees and proportions, it is hopeless to attempt to secure that co-ordination of Government action which is essential In face of the difficulties by which r,e are confronted^May I-urge that a meeting of Ministers be held and that this fundamental question of policy be fully discussed?
It appears to me that the Government Is pledged to the hilt to support the third, the 11 social&quot; policy. This carries with it by implication a large part of the fourth, the &quot;Imperial&quot; policy, for It is obvious that if large sums of capital are to be locked up In slow maturing investments (e.g. housing,) the trade of the country must be reduced and emigration on a large scale is a necessity. It also carries with It the necessity for the early institution of protection for those of our industries which if not shielded will be crushed by foreign competition. The general financial policy of the country seem to me to require urgent consideration in the light of Government election pledges.    They appear to me to be quite incompatible with action along the lines &quot;required by the orthodox financial policy.     Be this is as it may, of one thing I am quite certain.   The present lack of real agreement on policy makes it quite useless to hope for speedy action in any direction.    I would sooner adopt the worst of the four policies and stick to it than continue the present pull devil, pull &quot;baker between Departments which 1b preventing decisive action in any direct icii.I attach schedules showing decisions, taken and subjects awaiting report in connection with the rehabilitation of trade and the provision of employment.A.C.
