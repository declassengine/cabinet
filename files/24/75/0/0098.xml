The Committee had under consideration certain recommendations by tho Minister of Pensions for Ear Bonuses on the retired pay or tensions of officers or their relatives., and on the alternative pensions of men and men&apos; s v/idous,THE MINISTER OP PENSIONS saiO that this question had already been debated at considerable length.     The Memoran-duiu no1.&apos; under discussion, (Paper G*Tfl 6798), contained pro-posals slightly different from those he had originally made&apos;, He had proposed to ask that the extension of the &apos;.&quot;rar Bonus should be made to tho end of the financial year, but he felt that as ye were coming to a period of falling prices It yas not necessary to extend it beyond the earliest 6nt.o necessitated by the administrative work entailed in v/ith-clrauing the increase.    He had therefore proposed the cxten-si on of the   r,v Bonus on. men s pensions to the end of .september/
- s - . 404September 1019, and In order to conform v&amp;th this date he pro-posed that the War Bonu3 on officers1 pensions and on the alter-natlve pensions of men and their widows, should have effect from January 1st to September 30th, 19+9.MR. BALDWIN said the Treasury was still opposed to the scheme.    Since the matter had been last considered, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had announced that he was taking steps to release pensions and gratuities from income toxc   This constituted a very great concession, especially to those officers whose income was under  500 a year.    A further point was that if the advance was granted to officers who have served dcring the present war, it would be impossible not to grant an Increase in the pensions of those v/ho had served in former wars, and then the whole question of tho pensions of all civil servants would have to be considered,,SIR CHARLES HARRIS referring to Papor 131 said it would not be possible to defend anomalies which would arise by giving an Increase to some people calculated on service pension and. not^ giving it to others.    He pointed out that prices had begun to fall and that the Ilnlstry of Pood held out a hope of further-,,, decreases *    He thought it was rather late to st,art giving a bonus on pensions In order to meet the increased cost of living  . at a time when the cost of living was beginning to go down*THE MINISTER OP PENSIONS pointed, out that the pensions granted to officers who had served in former wars wero for the most part service pensions, while in all the cases now under consideration there was an element of disability, although he admitted that some of them included partly service pension and partly disability pension.    Uith regard to the point, of its being granted in order to meet the increased cost of living, the l&apos;ar Bonus now proposed was long overdue and should have been given when tho men&apos;s pensions were increased in November last..THE .CHAIRMAN said that at the present time the treasury were incurring losses In forcing down prices in food and. rawmaterials...,    The stocks in Government hands vere being cold at less/
less than tho cost price e    V/hile this of fort was being made to bring down the cost of living It v/as proposed to add a War Bonus to pensions In order to meet tho Increased cost of livings    This appeared to be dealing with tho same question in two ways, and did not appear to bo necessary,,THE MINISTER OF PEHSIOilS said that his proposal did not affect officers who were well-to-do.    He had in fact introduced Into his scheme over-riding maxima beyond which the bonuses would not be granted.    He referred to Paper Ho. 131 by the Assistant Financial Secretary to the VJar Office, in which It was stated that anomalies will arise from the fact that in some of the Officers&apos; pensions there was an element of service pension,-    He pointed oat in this respect that an officer would not retire generally speaking were it not for the disability which he suffered,, . SIR CHARLES HARRIS pointed out that officers of ben retired voluntarily.     There were many officers who although they had suffered serious disabilities,, such as tho loss of a leg;- had yet remained in the army, and many wo aid now retire voluntarily but with a disability entitling them to disability pension.     An officer of long standing would know exactly how much he was drawing by way of service pension, and hou much by way of disability pension,     He thought that if the increase were given at all, it should be given only on the pure disability pension,THE CHAIRMAN said he did not think a case had been made out for the increases proposed by tne Minis tor of Pen-sionsc     The Government were spending a great deal of morey In order to bring down prices, and the income tar, concession was undoubtedly a great boon.     At the. end of 1918 he thought there night have been a case for the increases, but at present he thought there was none*     On the other hand there would certainly be a great number of cases of hardship9 and he suggested it might be possible to deal with these by way of discretionary grantsflThe
THE MINISTER OF PENSIONS said that as far as his Department was concerned, tho discretionary method of grantInn increases was administratively Impossible.    He did not feel able to set up any machinery.which would deal promptly with all the cases which would come before it, They were already greatly behind with their work,  and the -Jar Office had now intimated that they were going to demobilise as many light duty officers as they could about the beginning of March, and his Department would be over-whelmed with work as a consequence,.SIR CHARLES HARRIS suggested that the Civil liability-Ities Commission might undertake to do this work,MR. BALDY/IN said that if any increase were to bogranted at all, the Treasury would prefer that it shouldbe discretionary, &apos;   He could, however, offer no opinion asto whether it were posaftaio administratively,THE CHAIRMAN said he was not convinced it was*impossible to set up machinery for this purpose,    He instanced the way in which the recruiting machinery was set up throughout the whole country in a very short time. There were two thousand tribunals in the country, who had-had experience of dealing with hundreds of thousands of men,, and he thought this work could very well be entrusted to them,     Tho administration of the tribunals of course would be transferred from the Local Government Board to the 1&apos;inistry of Pensions0THE MINISTER OP PENSIONS sal-1 that according to his experience the so tribunals consisted of people like borough councillors,, labour members and others.     He did not think it was a practicable suggestion that officers who desired an extra grant should be made to lay their circumstances before these tribunals.,THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that many of the officers who were granted commissions in the last two years of thewar/j
- 5 - 407war had already appeared before t^ose Tribunals.THE MINISTER OF PENSIOHS., continuing, said that the Special Grants Committee, as well as the Headquarters&apos; Staff of the Ministry of Pensions., wore already so over-burdened with work that they could not undertake tho additional labour that would be entailed in a discretionary scheme.     He would prefer a flat rate addition of 20&apos;.   If they considered it necessary to save money he suggested that they might reconsider the ever-riding maxima which ho had put forward,DR. MACNAMARA said that he was in sympathy with the proposals put forward by the Minister of Pensions, but as the other members of tho Committee appeared to be against it, he suggested that the increase instead of being 20 &apos; as proposed should be made 10;?.The 0 osimi 11 ec dec ido 0.: -(a) Hot to accept the proposals for a  &apos;ar Bonus nut forward by the Minister of -Pensions in his Paper, G.T, 6798.(b) To recommend to the Minister - of pensions that he should consider whether an increase could be granted on a discretionary basis.The Minister of Pensions desired to place on record his dissent from these decisions of the Committee, and hi Intention of bringing the matter before the &apos;;ar Cabinet as early as possible.     Ho could net accept the recommend ation of the Committee to grant an increase on a dis-crctionary basis, firstly, because ho considered it was administratively impossible to do so, secondly on accumt of the distinction that would be drawn thereby between the treatment meted cut to officers and men.&apos;PLEM11&apos;ITA-   3. The Committee had under consideration Paner Ho, 128)i! OR OTHERilSTAHCE TO by the Minister of Pensions, and Pacer Ho. 133 by Sir Charles:;0P  THE&apos; STAHDIKG   Harris on the ouestion of the supplementation or other assistance to men of the new standing Army.SIR CHARLES HARRIS pointed out that it was not possible to decide this matter until the conditions of service of the now standing Army had been decided uoon.   The ar Office had under preparation their scheme for the permanent post-war army, but it was not yet ready.   They die not contemplate/
M    0     &quot;*contemplate, however, that supplementary allowances would be granted to fresh recruits in the new standing finny. The Committee decided:- 1To postpone consideration of this quest! n until . the&apos; .ar Cfficc scheme containing the conditions of service for the new standing Army was complete, and to draw the attention of the &quot;..:ar Cfficc to the urgent necessity of completing this scheme an soon as possible.3RATUITIBS    4, DR. MCNAlARA with reference to Panor &apos;,:o. 154, saidfO TEMPORARYIAVAL that under their contract of service tcmoorary naval officer^OFFICERS/were entitled to no gratuity whatever.    Attention had been drawn however to the gratuities to temporary army officers under Article 947 of the l\oyal Warrant.    Accordingly the Admiralty had approached the Treasury with a view to temporar navel officers being granted a gratuity, end after a great many representations they had decided to grant a gratuity to   &apos; temporary naval officers of 100 Cays1 pay for the first year and 50 days1 pay for each succeeding year or part of tno year of service,    Thore was great discontent amongst the temoorarv naval officorE that they were being granted a gratuity con-si sting -of a smaller number of days than temporary officers in the array.    He had raised this quostion at the last meet in of the Committee, and the Chairman hr.d enouired if the nay of naval officers was not greater than the pay of array officers of corresponding rankj   and he, Dr. Hacnamara, had been asked to consider tho question as to how many days1 pay would bring the naval officers&apos; gratuity up to that of the army officer. He had gone into this matter, but from the figures ho presente to tiie Committee in Paper *.;o, 134, it would be seen that the pay of the naval officer was generally lovr, than that *f an army officer of equivalent rank.    On the grounds of nay therefore it was not possible to justify a gratuity to a naval officer of a smaller number- of days1 pay than that granted to an army officer,SIR (CHARLES HARRIS said that tho same question had arisen in the case of the doctor and the dentist. It had boon decided to grant the latter a smaller gratuity than theformer/
former, since he had no mention of gratuity in his contract of service, while the doctor had.    With regard to the gratuities granted under Article 497 of the Royal Warrant, these were admitted to he excessive^     It had been agreed by the Committee on January 3rd that officers of the jRoyal Naval Division should be granted a gratuity under Article &apos;497, but it was on the explicit understanding that this should not be extended to other temporary officers of the navy.MR, BALDWIN said that he did not think that this   &apos; question should be re-opened now0    Temporary officers in the army received their gratuity under Article 497.    It was admitted that this was very excessive.     Temporary naval officers had joined without any contract of service^    They expected however when the end of the war came to be granted a gratuity of some kind or other0     On November 4th, 1918, Admiral Tothill had told him verbally that the Admiralty would be satisfied with a gratuity of 100 days1 pay for the first year, and 50 days1 pay for each succeeding year or part of a year of services     On the 20th November this had been confirmed by an official letter from the Admiralty to the Treasurye    With regard to the question of prize money, the Treasury had suggested that prize money should be counted in estimating a gratuity.    The War Cabinet, however, had turned down this suggestion, but he would like to point out that as most naval officers obtained this money, the net result would be that most of them would have more at the end of the war by way of gratuity and prize money, than a temporary army officer would get as gratuity.     If things were left as they were it was quite true that a few naval officers would have a sense of grievance, but he thought that if the gratuity was increased to the same number of days1 pay as that granted to temporary army officers under Article 497, in addition to the award of prize money, a great many more army officers would be dis-gruntled.
DR. MACNA/ARA pointed out that in p11 probability no prize money could be given until the end of the present year: also it was necessary for an officer to spend 30 months at sea in order to qualify for prize money.THE CHAIRMAN 39id that be was of the opinion that the number of days 1 pay given by way of gratuity should be the some in both services a     It would not make the gratuity exactly the same, but he thought it was&apos;logically indefensible that a temporary officer in the armyfshould be granted a greater number of days&apos; pay in his gratuity than a temporary officer In the Navy,The Committee decided:That temporary officers in the navy should be granted a gratuity of 124 days&apos; pay for the first year of service,, and 62 days&apos; pay for each subsequent year or part of a year of service.isions of 5. THE MINISTER OF PENSIONS, with reference to Paper 132,3 Army ofjupation   said that the existing scheme of pensions would be carried 1 the new?.commanding      on up to the time of the end of the war.     After that theyty.would either revert to the old Royal Farrant, or a new royal warrant would have to be drawn up.     It was a matter whichhe thought should be settled immediately, because men werebeing recruited daily, and there was no doubt they thought they would be granted pensions on the same scale as at present6He had recommended that a Committee should be set up to look into this matter.DR. MACNA ARA pointed out that all pensions wouldhave to be revised in the light of the new conditions ofservice that were being prepared by the Admiralty, farOffice and,the Air Ministry.     As things stood the presentRoyal &apos;. arrant would cease to have effect at&quot;-:the end of thewar, and he thought that the Admiralty, &quot;or Office and AirMinistry should have their attention drawn to $the hiatusthat was likely to ensue unless they were ready with their new Royal Warrant at that time,     Before a Committee was setup he would like to see the terms of reference, as he did notthink that an interdepartmental committee should deal with questions/
411-mm Q m*questions of service pensions.THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that there were two questions which would have to he decided with regard to the new standing army, namely, the rates of pay and the Service pension,     There were five Departments Interested, the.Treasury, Admiralty, -ar Office, Air Ministry and the Ministry of Pensions;   and he thought it was a question for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to look into In conjunction with the Departments concerned.;THE MINISTER OP PENSIONS said that he thought that the pensions for the three services should he fixed along similar lines, that was why he had suggested having an inter-departmental Committees     He had brought the proposal to this Committee before referring It to the war Cabinet, so that If they agreed the Committee could recommend to the Cabinet the setting up of the Inter-departmental Committee which he suggested,,SIR CHARLES HARRIS said that he thought the Ear Office,. Admiralty and the Air Ministry should first of all&apos; consider their own conditions of service, and when they had arrived at their conclusions, they should then meet and attempt to bring them into line with each other.The Committee decided:&apos;To draw the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the urgent necessity of going with the Depart-ments concerned into the matter of pensions for the Armed Forces after the end of the war, when the present Pensions Ministry regulations would cease to apply to fresh casesQ2,..
