Clubs&apos;,.&apos; all-phases of the problem on the spot..   It&apos;will avail nothing for them to ask deputations from these Clubs to meet them at Cardiff,&apos; Newport or Swansea,   These Valley Clubs have a different&apos; life to Clubs in Town, The Valleys should be visited and the whole question doalt with in the Valleys.   I have no knowledge of my oiin of Club life, but I am moved to ask you to take Immediate action- as these Club members are pressing me all the time.--  They are largely miners and expect they bombard me because I am the President of their Federation or Trade Union,sincerely yours, (Signed)        WILLIAK BRAOi)./,3ERTIIiLERY WORMGtBKIS SOCIAL-CLUB&apos;&amp; INSTITUTE,limited the Limes,Abortillery, Mon, Oth February,- 1919.The Rt, Eon.&apos;William 3race,-M. &quot;Devonfields&quot; , f The Fields Hoad,NEWPORT,- MON.Dear Sir,I am further directed to ask you to use your great influence with the authorities concerned especially to&apos;Clause (a; section I. of f the enclosed Petition?-and thereby remove the unnecessary and obnoxious restriction which is unfairly imposed u ,on us, and that&apos; if the authorities deem them still necessary, let the same be imposed upon the whole of the other English counties, so as to remove the sordid inferences that may be drawn from the fact that the necessity of the said restrictions needs only to be, applied to Monmouthshire, notwith-stanaing the fact that Monmouthshire&apos;&quot;hss a higher percentage of heavy

The Limes,Abertillery, Mon. 8th February, 1919.The Right Hon. William Brace, M.P,Dear Mr. Bra*e,I am instructed on behalf of the following Clubs snd Institutes situated in the Parliamentary Division of Abertjllery,viz: Blaina, Abertillery, Aborbeeg/ Llanhilleth, Mewbridgo and Owmoarn Constitutional Clubs, Abertillery, Six Bells, Crumlin, ilewbridge, Abercarn and Pentwynmawr VJorkingmen&apos;s Clubs and Institutes^ with a collective membership of 3,400 - to forward the following petition with e view of you placing the same before the V/ar Cabinet, Oentral Liquor Control Beard or any other Department or authorities you may deem expedient, to obtain for them the most desired results herein-after mentioned and for which they would be deeply grateful to you for same at your earliest possible oonvenienoo and opportunity.The abolition of the Central liquor Control Board1s Order of May 8th, 1916, as to the hours of consuirption of Intoxicating Liquors on weekdays and blindays, as applicable to the aforementioned area, on the following grounds(a) Monmouth now being the only English County, where tho saidorder is now in Operation (or that part thereof which applies to Sundays).(b) that the restrictions were imposed upon us as a War measure and- which now no lon0er exists.(c) that this area being purely a Mining area, where the three&quot;shift&quot; principle is in operation, Justice can only be served by continuous hours of the sale of intoxicants (i.e. no-break in,the.sale of such from the opening to the closing hours),(d) that such restrictions should now $nly come into operationwith the sanction of both Houses of Parliament;(e) that ov/in,:V. to &apos;che great shortage of houses prevailing Inthe district, overorowdiig being rampant, and that the Clubs being the members &quot;Home from Home&quot; is one of the few Institutions that exists here to relieve the dreari-ness of our oxistence.(f) that the Liquor Control board has now deemed it advisable(so. far as the said Order applies to Sundays) to remove the restrictions in the Carlyle area which is directly unaer the board control.Th--.it che allotment of supplies of Beers to Clubs should be based.; upon the present membership, on the $rounds that the present member-ship is now 1,200 in excess of that of Jany. 1916, due to:-(a) the Educational, Social and Moral Activities end Facilities of the Clubs;(b) being purely a joining District tho rapid demobilisation of our members from His Majesty^ Forces;(c) that tbe present gravities of Beer does not contain the food values required :?y the workers;(d) that only one grade of Beers should bo brewed so as to prevent profiteering by retailers and Brewers1 Agents.Thai the Vvholosale prices of Beers, and Spirits ss supplied to Clubs should&apos;be fixed by the Food Controller on the following grounds:-(a) because Clubs can obtain additional supplies other than the amount they are entitled to b   the present scale of allowances from persons other than direct from the Brewers and Distillers, which is far in excess of the prices for the same fixed by the Contioilertvie earnestly hope that this petition will have the serious consideration of. the authorities concerned with a view of the early removal of-the restrictions heretofore mentioned, also that ways and means may be found, to prevent tie grievances re supplies and prices mentioned herein.(Signed) on behalf of the above,(Signed)   HARRY BEMSTT,Acting Secretary.
Mr., Qnller. 17th February, 1919.All 6 Clauses cf Section I rf the Abertillery Club&apos;s petitian tc Mr. Brace concern the Liquar Control Board, and inn* way concern the Ministry of Food, but I would point out that whereas thortage of material still necessitates restriction-tions on quantify and strength of drink, Lord Daemon&apos;s temperance restrictions were imposed purely as a war expedient and their revocation would be very popular with the industrial , tla0s.es.Section 2 raises a question of \:reat difficulty.   The effect of the Output of Beer Restriction Act, 1916, and of the Intoxicating Liquor (Output &amp; Delivery) Orders of successive Food Controllers has been to limit the quantity of Beer to a peroentage throughout the country on the basis of 1915/1916. At the same time on account of a, certain shifting of population contingent upon the opening Up of war industries, and on account of the specially strenuous nature of some of the work, the Feed Controller retained a oertain barrelage which he distributed under special licence in the most necessitous munition areas.By this legislation all licensed traders were given statu-tory right to their proper percentage of Trade, and the obvious difficulty presented in what is really a proposal to transfer barrelage from licensed traders to Clubs appears&apos; to me unaur-mountable .Section 2 (a) .   The&apos;Food Controller^ sole consideration in limiting gravities was shortage of material.The maximum average gravities are fixed on a basis calou-lated to make the available material go as far as possible in bulk barrels of drinkable beer.Section 2 (d).   Owing to technical and other considerations this is at present an impossibility.   TJnder a complete scheme of State Control, it might (if it were thou?Jht desirable) be possible or nearly so.Section 3 (a).   7/wholesale prices of Spirits to dlubs are already fixed under the spirits (prises &amp; Description) Hoi 2. Order,.As regards Beer it Is absolutely impossible, for a number of technical reasons, to fix,.maximum wholesale prices between Brewer and Publican; Consequently if they were fixed, between Brewer and Club, a Club would be at a disadvantage as compared with a publitan in obtaining supplies.(Sgd.)    G. WALTER ROFFEY.Mr. Davidson.Sir Walter RoffeyVs memorandum submitted. Sto far asifhis Department is concerned, we have merely imposed such restrictions as the li. itation of quantities rendered necessary.   The sooner the trade is left to fight it cut with the public, so that it is not a question of slanging the Government whenever a man -can*t get a drink,  the better we shall be pleased.(Sgd.)   FRAKEC H. COLLER.inistry cf Food,16th February, 1919.
