Waterfield.Mr. G.?I, Evans,     SecretaryFATUITIES 2 WARRANT7P&quot; &quot;&quot;TTY OFFICERS3IT OF THE cOT^. AR1IYID AIR1.   The Minutes of the 44th Meeting were approved.2.      DR. MACNAMARA, with reference to the 44th Meeting Minute 3, said that the Admiralty had received a number of letters on the subject of the increments granted to the.war gratuities of men who drew Service pay and pension   concurrently.   All these letters were unanimous in expressing the view that the award of only half increments was an unjust one.The men in the Navy took the vie?/ that their pension had been earned and they were very touchy on the subject.The original scheme for war gratuities to men was a War Office scheme and it had been approved- by the. Committee and.referred to   the War Cabinet.   The latter in agreeing to the recommendations put forward had issued instructions to the Admiralty to formulate an exactly similar scheme for the Navy.   The Board of Admiralty, however, now felt that they could not agree to the position taken up on this point,-MR. FORSTER said that the War Office too were receiving complaints on this point, but they felt that since officers and men generally were treated in the same -way, retired men who are re-employed should be treated on the same basis as retired officers re-employed.   The latter obtained a much smaller gratuity than other officers, and the War Office held to their    . original proposal of giving half increments to the gratuities of retired men re-employed.SIR CHARLES HARRIS added that in comparing a retired Officer of the Army with a retired naval officer
Officer, the Array Officer was merely getting what he had contracted for, and the Naval officer would, under the scheme approved by the War Cabinet, obtain a sum of money far above any thin/; mentioned in his contract.THE COMMITTEE failed to reach any agreement on this subject^ and it ms agreed that as the Admiralty and the War office **cre at variance on the matter it should be brought before the far Cabinet in order to obtain a decision. ;3.     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Accountant General of the ITavy recommending certain gratuities for temporary Naval Eedical Officers.PRi MACNAMARA said that it had been the intention of the Admiralty to treat their medical officers as regards gratuities in exactly the same way as they treated their other officers, that is to say, they would get 100 days&apos; pay for the first year of service and 50 days&apos; pay for each succeeding year or part of a year.   As however the War Office had a contract to pay their doctors  60 a year for each year or part of a year of service, the Admiralty had decided to fall in with this scheme in the case of their own medical officers.&apos; The Treasury, however, had blocked the War office pro-posal for gratuities to dental surgeons, and csnse-quently the whole question of gratuities to medical and dental officers, was undecided,SIR CHAHL3S HARRIS said that he had talked this matter over with Mr. Barstfw, and the latter had agreed to recommend to the Treasury that the Army and Navy dental surgeons should be given a gratuity of  30 a year for each year or part of a year of service.MR. 7TALKER said that from &quot;the Admiralty point of view he saw no justification for this proposal. No Naval Officer served under any contract arid it had been the intention to treat their dental surgeons in exactly the same respect as regards gratuities as their other officers.   As things stood at present the pay of a dentist was  1 a day, that of a doctor 22/- a day.   He suggested that a doctor should get a gratuity of  60 a year and a .dentist  50 a year, otherwise they would all come under the scale of gratuities granted in G,T. 6 592He pointed cut again what no officer in the Havy served on a contract basis, and said there was no justification for giving a gratuity to one officer and refusing it to another.   The case of the Army was different as seme officers were promised gratuities in their contract of service; others were not.
SIR CHARLES HARRIS field, th Vfar Office found this a (question of great difficulty, and he hoped, that the two departments would try and act together on the matter. Doctors in the army served under a contract under which they obtained a gratuity of  60 a year for each year of service, but no mention was made of any gratuity in the contract.under which dental surgeons served.   The&apos; Admiralty proposal to give dentists a gratuity of  50 a year would, give doctors an excuse for complaining that by-comparison they were being, badly treated.   On the other hand, he admitted that as dentists would receive no gratuity either under contract or outside it they might labour under a sense of grievance, and it v*as in order to meet this that he agreed with Mr,Barstov to recommend a gratuity of  50 a year.. MR. AAT RI&apos;&quot;IhLD said that the   ar Office had some time ago nut forward to the Treasury the proposals for gratuities for dental surgeons.   The Treasury had negatived the suggestion and as nothing further had been mentioned on the matter for the past six months, it .:as to be assumed that the &apos;&quot; ar Office would not have brought it up again had not the Admiralty- done so.   As far as concerned the Treasury the &apos; ar Office dentists constituted the bigger, question as so many mere officers were affected.oIK CKARL.-S KARRIS said that if a dentist was given a ,: ratuity of  50 a year, that ?,ould bo giving him as many days1 pay over his contract - as a doctor receivd as part of the contract; and it would present a-doctor with a great grievance, if the dentist were given so, nuch more than his contract while the doctor was given nothing more than he had. contracted fort   .UR. rORRTAR said that the &quot;ar Office had had a great many enquiries from dentists on the subject of the gratuity. In reply to a question he Said, that all,doctors whether serving at home or in the field drew rations and that a. doctor serving abroad drew ration allowance while dentists drew no allowances whatever,    If doctors felt a sense of grievsnse at the granting cf a gratuity to dentists, this fact could be --o in ted out to them,   He supported, a gratuity to dentists, of   0 a. year,SIR CoARLES HARRIS enquired what was the .corresponding rank of the temporary medical officers above&apos; the rank of Surgeon Lieutenant to whom it was proposed in Kr. V alter&apos;-s memorandum to pay a gratuity at the ordinary rates ,t&quot;R. &apos; ALhoR said, that these men held, the rank of Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or above, which, was cquiva-lent to the rank of Major or above in the Army; but very few were affected because only the men who are at the top of their profession had reached a rank above that of Surgeon Lieutenantu

BLAND said that the Air Ministry considered the dentist a very important member of - the Air Force and thoy were inclined to agree with Mr. Walker&apos;s proposal that dentists should be  ranted a gratuity of  50....... wATERPIELD suggested that the gratuity shouldbe paid as a monthly gratuity and not for each year or part of a year of service.   The latter seemed to be a very wasteful method, since a man who served only one day out of a year would obtain the same gratuity as o man who served for the whole year..   This suggested.! wasnot of course applicable to eistingregulations, buthe thought it might be applied to the present proposalsIt was generally agreed by the Committee, however that this suggestion could not be carried out.MR. WALKER raised the question of the Surgeons in the R.N.V.R., some of whom had been in the Service before the War.   Would these &quot;en receive a gratuity under G.T. 6592 or the  GO a year which had now been decided upon?SIR CHARLES HARRIS said that Territorial Medical Officers received the gratuity under Article 497 of the Pay V/arrant and he assumed that burgeons in the R.N.V.R, would be treated in the corresponding way under Navy Rules.The Committee decided:-(a) That temporary Surgeon Lieutenants should receive a gratuity Of  60 for each year or part of a year of service, with a minimum of two months1 pay as provided for in the existing regulations.(b) Dental Surgeon Lieutenants in the Navy and Dental Surgeons in the Army and Royal Air Force should receive a gratuity of  50 for each year or part of a year of service.\(c) That all permanent Medical Officers of the R.N.V.R-, and temporary Medical Officers of the Royal Navy-., above the rank of surgeon Lio^tenant should receive a gratuity at the ordinary races, namely 100 clays pay for the first year and 50 days&apos; pay for each sub sequent year or part of a year..4.   The Committee had before them paper No.125 by the Assistant Financial Secretary to the Air Ministry, raising the question as to whether the existing rates of separation allowances could be promised to men w&amp;o extended their service and married during the period of extention, no matter how late in the period of extended service the menjiDSD SERVICE. should marry,C-TCHARLESHARRIS said that on the Question of marriage a fresh ruling would have to be obtained and a &apos; new :vi rriago establishment set up for the permanent post-war 8xrmy.   At present therefore it seemed that nothing ooul . be settled in the matter of promising separation allowances.MR.BLAND said that he agreed that the question of iage establishment could not be raised now4   But the matter of separation allowances had. been put up to the Air. Ministry by -certain men who were thinkirfg of extending their service and apparently contemplated matrimony*   He thought it desirable that an- answer should be given.the permanent marriage
M 5 **The Committee decided that all $inquiries on this subject should be replied to in the following sense:-&quot;That at present there were no restrictions placed on marriage.   If might be that at a later date certain restrictions would have to be put into operation, but if that was done, due notice would be g&amp;ven of the proposed change, and s   any man who married be^ure this notice war given would be entitled to separation allowance as at prosent&quot;,lOTTIES TO    5.
