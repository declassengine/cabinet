AMERICAN COMMISSION TO NEGOTIATE PEACE.February 12th, 1919.Memorandum for the President,1.     The general situation of the Allied forces in Northern Russia is as follows :     Eased on Archangel, there.is a total Allied foroe of about 16,230, of whioh the. Americans number 5;100; the British 6,200, the French 1,650, the Italians 2b. the Russians 3,325.    Of the American foroe about 1.200 are stationed at Archangel, and the remainder is scattered in small detachments, in some oases amounting to only &apos;3ne platoon, over a wide area, extending from Pinega, about AO miles to the eastward of Archangel, to the southeastward along the Dwina and Vaga Riversa about 15C miles from Archangel, to the southward, along the Vologda Railroad, to about 100 miles from Archangel, and to Onega, about 00 miles to the westward of Archangel.Eased on Murmansk, there is a total Allied force of 16,200.     This force includes no Americans, 0,650 British, 700 French, 1,250 Italians, 12 Serbians, 6,450 Russians.     This force is scattered in detachments extend-ing from Petohenga, on the Arctic Ocean, to Soroka, on the Whit-e Sea, about 250 miles south of Murmansk.Archangel is from this moment entirely closed to sea communication until late in May, while Murmansk is to a certain extent an open Port throughout the year. Allied troops based on Archangel are then, throughout a large part of the year, entirely dependent for outside assistance on the railroad from Murmansk to a point on the railroad approximately due west of Onega and thence by road eastward.     Allied troops basod on Murmansk&apos; /depend
depend upon the railroad and to oome extent on road a.   All roads and the railroad are now in extremely bad condition. The Murmansk Railroad, In the sector where It is most essential for the maintenance of the Allied troops, is built on bog and due to this fact repairs, except in the frozen season, are almost impossible.     At present the supply and raaintonasfis of the Allied and American troops in Northern Russia due to the condition of the railroad is rendered extremely difficult and the comfort of the troops is therefore greatly affected.     Should the troops in the Archangel sector continue to be hard pressed by hostile forces during the present closed season, there will be danger for their safety unless reinforcements can reach them from the Murmansk sector, and this will be possible only if the Murmansk Railroad in the White Sea sector Is properly maintained and operatedr.Because of the dependence that must be put upon the Murmansk Railroad for supply * and maintenance of troops in the Murmansk sector, and possible reinforcement purposes In the Archangel sector, as well as the great need for this railroad in the best possible condition for early withdrawal purposes, which Eritish sentiment now favours, ., the British are very anxious to send to Murmansk the following technical troops ;Railway troops . 2 Companies and details, (1 operating Company and 1 maintenance Company)   720 menR4 E.   (1 Works Germany..........150   u(Signals  , ,  .  ,...........    240   *(Electric Lighting ..... .....     40   &quot;Royal Army Service Corps, Royal Army Ordnance Department, Royal Army Medical Corps. .....     253   wTotal,     1,400The Eritish now make a request that the Onited States assist In furnishing these technical troops to the extent of supplying the railway troops amounting to approximately 72C men./2. Ita
2.     It is reoommonded that American railway troops, 2 Companies, (1 for operating the railroad and 1 for its maintenance, together with neoessary details; approximately 720 man) te sent to reinforce the Allied and American troops in Russia.     The Immediate object of this reinforcement should be to assist in providing for the cafety, supply, and comfortable maintenance of the Allied and American troops in Northern Russia during the present closed season, the ultimate object being to plade the railroad in serviceable condition for the prompt withdrawal of the troops from Northern Russia as soon as the season permit a.3,     No doubt the idea of sending American troops, even though they be technical troops, to Russia at this time will raise in the United States the following questions,.&quot;and similar questions with respect te our present force in Russia even now are undoubtedly in the minds of people In general;First:     Are &amp;dd.i-uiec*ai Amfcrioan troops being sent to Russia t.i- assist in penetrating furth&amp;r into Russian territory?    If so, how much further and why? Seoond:   Are these troops to assist in maintaining the Allied line where it now is?    If so, for hew long and 7/hy? Third:     Or, is this force to assist in tho withdrawal of troops from Northern Russia at the earli-est opportunity?4.     I believe that the third of the foregoing questions should b*? answered in the affirmative, and without delay,I, therefore, think that the President should now/have
have a olear understanding with his eolleaguos on th* Supreme War Council that the sending of additional troops to North Russia is for the purpose of(a) Assuring the greater safety during this winter of the Allied forces now there;(b) The better supply anl, if necessary, the reinforcement from Murmandk of the advanced detachments south of Murmansk and Archangel, by improved military facilities resulting from the sending of American Railway troopsj and(c) Facilitating the prompt withdrawal of these troops as soon as the weather conditions in the spring wild   permit.It? is with the foregoing understanding that I recommend assent to the request of the British Government for the dispatch of the American Railway troops specified above.(Signed) Tasker H. Eliss.Entirely approved:(Signei) WGODRCK WILSCN.A frrue copy:(Signed) Wf B* WALLACE,Lieutenant Colonel, General Staff.
