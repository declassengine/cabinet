[This Document; is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s. Government.]printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1919.IlEMIGRATION POLICY.I WISH to submit to the Cabinet for an early decision the revised draft of the Emigration Bill, together with the accompanying letter and memorandum from the Provisional Emigration Committee appointed by Mr. Long in December last.The Emigration Bill which was introduced last session encountered considerable opposition from several quarters. The representatives of the various Oversea Govern-ments objected to the constitution of the proposed emigration authority, by which they would have been included in, and become to some extent responsible for, the actions of a body directly controlled by the Secretary, of State. They also resented the application to them of the preventive censorship on all emigration literature or propa-ganda implied in clause 10 of the original Bill, and to some of the provisions with regard to passage brokers&apos; licences. The constitution of the proposed emigration authority has been amended, so that the oversea representatives now only deal with the emigration authority through their membership of a separate Consultative Committee. The disputed clause has been recast and the authority&apos;s, power to interfere restricted to cases where the authority is satisfied that directly misleading information has been issued for purposes of profit.In its original form the Bill was also strongly opposed, both inside and outside the House of Commons, by the shipping interest. The objections from this quarter have since been satisfactorily overcome by certain modifications in the Bill itself, and by the promise to secure representation for the shipping interest on the proposed Central Emigration Authority.The Bill was further subjected to a very vigorous and persistent criticism in the House of Commons and in Committee, by certain members who objected on general grounds to any encouragement being given .to emigration to other parts of the British Empire in preference to emigration to foreign countries. This particular obstacle has, I am informed, been eliminated by the recent General Election.The effect of the Bill as it now stands may be briefly summarised as follows : It sets up a Central Emigration Authority under the Secretary of State for the Colonies, competent to furnish information and advice to intending emigrants, and to carry out any policy with regard to emigration decided upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government, both in the direct administration of that policy and in co-ordinating it with the policy of the Oversea Governments and with the efforts of unofficial bodies interested in emigration. It also gives the Central Emigration Authority power to exercise a reasonable measure of control over passage brokers and agents, and over the activities of emigration societies.The necessity for a central authority with these powers was strongly urged both by the Dominions Royal Commission (Cd. 846^) and by the Empire Land Settlement Com-mittee (Cd. 8672),and is implied in Resolution XIlTof the Imperial. War Conference, 1918&quot;, quoted in the Committee&apos;s memorandum. The matter has now become one of urgency, for unless; the authority is constituted in good time the rush of emigrants may begin before any proper arrangements have been worked out for dealing with it, either on this side or overseas. If so, the result is bound to be confusion and serious public dissatisfaction. It is. for these reasons that I trust the Cabinet will decide that the Emigration Bill should be introduced and passed without delay.The policy advocated in the memorandum of the Committee is based on a sharp distinction between the general problem of emigration and the particular obligation of the State towards the ex-service men. As a matter of general permanent policy the Committee do not advocate direct State aid to emigration, preferring to rely on the economic development of the Empire and the improvement of its means of communication to create a natural flow of population within its confines. To this general rule they would, however, make an exception in favour of the State-aided emigration of women, in order to counteract one of the most serious social and1*194]
economic effects of the war and of uncontrolled emigration in the past, and to some extent also in favour of the State-aided emigration of children, where the circumstances are such that their prospects would be greatly improved by, starting in new surroundings.On the other hand, the Committee feel very strongly that the case of the ex-service men stands on a plane of its own, and that our obligation to give substantial advantages and the widest possible range of opportunities to these men cannot be limited to those of them who may wish to reside permanently in the United Kingdom, and denied to the very large number who will, in any case, wish to settle elsewhere within the Empire. The Committee have consequently based their conclusions in respect of ex-service men on the geileral principle that those who have fought for the Empire should be entitled to take their reward in any part of the Empire. In pursuance of that prin-ciple they advocate free passages, subject to certain necessary limitations, for ex-service men to any destination in the Empire, and make a number of other recommendations, the general effect of which is to extend to any particular class of ex-service men settling overseas similar, though not necessarily as substantial, assistance as that to which the same class would be entitled if it stayed at home. I earnestly hope that the Cabinet will give its approval both to the general principle and to the specific recom-1 mendations which appear to me to be conceived on sound and practical lines., ; ;        : - v MILNER.Colonial Office, February 18, 1919.
CONFIDENTIAL.(File 9/1.) Government Emigration Office, Horse Guards&apos; Parade,Sir, London, SAY. 1.   February 10, 1919.I AM desired by the Government Emigration Committee to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th December, 1018, requesting an expression of the views of the Committee as to the attitude winch should be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards emigration from these Islands, with special reference to the emigration of ex-service men and of women2. The views of the Committee, which - comprises representatives of all the Government Departments more directly affected, and of other interests concerned with emigration, are set forth in the accompanying memorandum.3. The Committee are very anxious that Mis Majestys Government should consider their recommendations and come to a definite decision with regard to them at as early a date as possible, in view of the many detailed arrangements and negotiations with the various Governments in His Majesty&apos;s Dominions which will be required to convert any of these recommendations into practical concrete schemes. In any case, they would press for the early passage into law of the legislation required in order to create a Central Emigration Authority capable of carrying out the necessary arrangements and negotiations, and empowered to direct and supervise emigration generally.4. The Committee wish to make it clear that they have prepared their memorandum independently of, and without consultation with, the representatives of the Oversea Governments in this country. But they consider it essential that there should be the closest consultation and co-operation with those Governments both in regard to the general terms of policy and in regard to the detailed arrangements for giving effect to that policy. They are anxious, therefore, as soon as they have received an indication of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter, to enter into preliminary consultation with.the official representatives of the Oversea Governments primarily concerned with emigration..5. They consider, however, that in order to arrive at an authoritative agreement on a common Imperial policy with regard to the immensely important problem of the best distribution of the population of the British Empire, alike from the point of view of the happiness of its citizens and of the strength and development of die whole, it would be very advantageous if His Majesty&apos;s Government could fully discuss these matters at a special conference with the Dominion Prime Ministers before they return to their own Dominions, or with such other representatives as the Prime Ministers may decide to depute for the purpose.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient Servant,L. S. AMERY,The Under-Secretary of State, Chairman,Colonial Office.Memorandum.I.-INTRODUCTORY.1. FOR many years before the War the volume of emigration from the United Kingdom was considerable, and the years immediately preceding the War were years of special activity. For the year ended the 31st of December, 1913, the total outward emigration movement from the United Kindom was 302,055. Between 19l)l and 1912 63 per cent of those who emigrated went to places within the Empire, the remainder going to foreign countries. In 1913 the proportion going to places within the Empire increased to 78 per cent.2. Before the War His Majesty&apos;s Government concerned itself with emigration movements mainly in connection with the preparation of statistical returns, the securing of a proper supervision of emigrant ships, and the provision of correct information and guidance as to openings overseas. Meanwhile, the Governments of the self-governing Dominions, acting independently of His Majesty&apos;s Government, carried out their own policy (usually one of encouragement) in connection with emigration from 1 lie United Kingdom. At the same time various societies and individuals actively encouraged emigration from these islands, and their activities were subject to little supervision or control.
3. The problem of emigration was discussed by the Dominions Royal Commission in interim reports, which dealt severally with the various self-governing Dominions. In their final report (d)ted the21st February, 11)17 !&quot;Cd. 8462]) they examined the problem, generally, explained the defects of the existing system in the United Kingdom,and the need for closer supervision by the Imperial Government, and for scientific study and scientific treatment of the whole subject. They recommended the constitution of a Central Emigration Authority which should be in charge of emigration, so far as it concerns the United Kingdom, and should supervise and control all passage brokers, shipping agents, and emigration societies.4. The problem was also discussed, with special reference to the emigration of ex-service men. in the report of the Empire Settlement Committee dated the 28th July, 1917 [Cd. 8672J. That report recommended the prompt creation of a Central Emigra-tion Authority on lines similar to those recommended by the Dominions Royal Commission.5. A Bill was introduced in Parliament last session for the purpose of giving effect to these recommendations by the constitution of a Central Emigration Authority, but failed to pass into law. The discussion which took place in regard to this Bill at the Imperial War Conference showed that the Dominion Governments preferred not to nominate representatives on the Central Authority, but to remain in closest touch with it by the creation of a Consultative Board. The actual resolution (XIII) passed ran as follows: The Imperial War Conference reaffirms the principle laid down by Resolu-tion XXI of the 1917 Conference, in favour of arrangements being made by which intending emigrants from the United Kingdom may be induced to settle in countries under the British flag. It is of opinion that the representatives of the Oversea Dominions in the United Kingdom should keep in the closest touch with any new body established by His Majesty&apos;s Government to supervise emigration from the United Kingdom. The Conference is of opinion that the appointment of a Consultative Committee, not to exceed ten members, on which representatives of the &apos; )versea Dominions should sit, to advise any such body, would afford the best means of co-operation.Emigration and the War.6. The War has materially affected the problem of emigration, and has increased its difficulties. Provisional figures furnished by the War Office show that 580,0)00 males between the ages of 20and 49 were killed and died of wounds or sickness during the War. They further indicate that this loss fell most heavily upon men.between the ages of 20 and 29, i.e., in the early years of that period of life which is specially suitable for active work, emigration, and marriage.7. At the census of 1911 the population of the United Kingdom between the ages of 15 and 15 contained an excess of females over males of 566,000. Provisional figures furnished by the Registrar-General show that it is estimated that on the 31st December, 1918, the excess of females over males between the ages of 15 and 45 had risen to 1,266,000. This large increase is, of course, mainly due to the War, but a small increase, amounting perhaps to 100,000, would presumably have occurred in any case owing to the ordinary excess of male over female emigration.8. The War has increased the difficulties of emigration by raising at least temporarily-the cost of passages to the Oversea Dominions. The following table shows the cheapest rates (A) just before the War and (B) at the present time : 	(A.)

The development of the population and wealth of the whole British Empire is the key to the problem of post-war reconstruction. The heavy burden of war debt upon every part of the Empire makes this development an immediate and urgent necessity.   The growth of population in the Dominions, in so far as it adds directly to
their strength and prosperity, and consequently to the strength and prosperity of the whole, and in so far as it increases the number of our own best customers arid purveyors of essential foodstuffs and raw materials, is so obviously desirable that it is assumed throughout in this memorandum thai emigration should, as far as possible, be directed to countries within the confines of the British Empire. On the other hand, it is equally necessary to keep in mind throughout that the main burden of the indebtedness for the recent war. and of the provision of Imperial defence in the near future, still rests upon this country, and that it is essential that its man-power and taxable capacity should not be weakened in the process of Imperial development.10. The question of migration from the United Kingdom to other pa its of the Empire is therefore essentially a question of clue adjustment. Such migration will be beneficial or injurious according to the extent to which it takes place and the conditions under which it is carried out.11. Within certain limits withdrawal of population from the United Kingdom tends to reduce the competition for employment, increase wages, and raise the standard of living ; and to such extent as it does this it also tends to increase the birthrate, and so eventually to make good the loss caused by emigration In so far as those who leave the United Kingdom for settlement in other parts of the Empire achieve success and multiply in their new home-&quot;, they tend still further to improve the conditions of employment in the Mother Country and to encourage the growth of its population by providing a growing market for its goods and a continuous supply of necessary food-tuffs and raw materials. In other words a moderate flow of emigration rightly directed tends not only to improve the immediate economic and social conditions in this country, but actually, in the long run, to increase both its total population and man-power. The population and man-power of these islands are obviously greater to-day than they could ever have become if British emigration had not developed the resources and built up the markets of the British Dominions.12. On the other hand, an excessive stream of emigration from the United Kingdom at any particular time, either of the population as a whole, or of a Darticular class or sex, may seriously weaken the whole social and economic fabric; while conversely, an excessive stream of immigration into the Dominions may temporarily create serious economic and social difficulties overseas, and encourage a state of public feeling unfavourable to the movement.13. Broadly speaking, migration during the last generation has, no doubt, benefited both the United Kingdom and the Empire as a whole. But it has not been without certain unsatisfactory features. Thus the emigration of men has heavily exceeded that of women. Between 1871 and 1911 the male emigrants from England and Wales exceeded the female by 500,000. There has also been an excessive depletion of the agricultural population in some parts of the United Kingdom, especially in Scotland. On the other hand, there has at times been an excessive flow to the Dominions of a type of population which they could not easily absorb. Thus emigration between the years 1910 and 1913 was exceptionally large. Towards the end of that period conditions in Canada became unsatisfactory, and there was consider-able unemployment and distress.11. The ideal is a constant flow of emigration neither in excess of what the United Kingdom or any section of it can afford to spare, nor in excess of what the Dominions can conveniently absorb. It is essential if this result is to be secured that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be in a position to furnish intending emigrants with accurate information, in order to direct them to those parts of the Empire where opportunities are really best, and not merely to those which are most advertised or to which emigration is most generously subsidised. It should also be in a position to warn them in time of adverse conditions overseas, which may make it desirable to dis-courage the flow of emigration. This is one of the main reasons which make it necessary to set up an effective central organisation in this country, and to entrust it with statutory powers to enable it to exercise some degree of check and control over the information disseminated through private, and often financially interested, channels.15. The question arises whether the Government should go further, and either grant State aid to emigration or impose restrictions upon it. It is impossible to adopt a policy of complete laissez-faire, because the Dominion Governments do, in fact, in various ways actively encourage emigration; and their action, though broadly speaking beneficial to themselves and to the Empire, may in certain cases, eg., by the depletion of the agricultural population, inflict injury on the United Kingdom. Emigration from this country is also encouraged by important business and philanthropic interests.
16. It is obviously impracticable, even if it were desirable, to interfere with the &apos; liberty of the subject, and attempt to check emigration by direct restriction.   If it is necessary to prevent excessive emigration from the ranks of any industry in the United  Kingdom, and particularly from agriculture,  the proper course would presumably be to make the conditions of the industry in question more attractive.17. On the other hand, a consideration of the strength and volume of emigration in recent years does not indicate the need of artificial stimulation of emigration as a whole. It is, in fact, reasonably certain that even in the absence of any special encouragement, emigration, when resumed, will be upon a considerable scale. It is even possible that it may be inconveniently large.18. There does not therefore seem to be sufficient reason for departing from the established policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government of refusing to grant State aid upon any considerable scale lo emigration in general, beyond such aid as is involved in the improvement of communications and the encouragement of the flow to the Dominions of the capital which is essential to ail development, and consequently to the influx of population. In other words, while it is desirable to multiply general facilities for Imperial development and communication, thus incidentally facilitating migration within the Empire on natural lines, ;t is not, as a general rule, necessary or desirable artificially to stimulate the emigration of individuals as such.19. On the other hand, there may be a case for direct State aid as a corrective to conditions which have arisen from the absence of regulation in the past or from special causes such as the War, e.g., the excess of women in the United Kingdom and the deficiency of women in the Dominions, or the existence in this country of a large number of poor children whose position and prospects in life would be better overseas than they would be here.W omen.20. The question of the emigration of women is dealt with in the report of the Dominions Royal Commission, which analyses in detail the distribution of the female population throughout the Empire. It will be seen from that report that in 1!)11 there was in the Dominions, between the ages of 15 and -15, a surplus of males over females of -184,000. This excess of males occurred chiefly in country districts ; in many urban districts females predominated. It may be assumed that the surplus of males in the Dominions has been reduced by the War, but that it is still considerable.21. The question of female emigration was also referred to in the report of the Empire Settlement Committee. In both reports special attention is called to its importance. It is described by the Empire Settlement Committee as the essential foundation of all effective Empire settlement.22. It is uncertain how far and to what extent the new avenues of employment which have been opened to women in this country since the beginning of the War will remain open to them after demobilisation. It is therefore possible, if not probable, that there will be unemployment and consequent discontent amongst large numbers of the female population. In any case, the excess of the female population is a cause for anxiety; and makes it desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should give, and should invite the Dominion Governments to give, increased facilities for the emigration of women, especially of young women, in so far as the Dominions may be able to absorb them.23. it is well known that the only women emigrants for whom there has hitherto been a large demand in the oversea Dominions are female domestic servants. The demand for emigrants of this class is practically unlimited. It is equally known that there- is at present an acute shortage of female domestic servants in this country. Primd facie the existence of this shortage seems to make it difficult to encourage the emigration of women oi the servant class. There is, however, evidence to show that many women in this country, especial y those who have recently been engaged in war work, while not prepared to take up domestic service at home, may very probably be prepared to enter domestic service in the Dominions.24. Women who havt uoi, hitherto had any experience of domestic service might aiso be given an opportunity of qualifying themselves for such service, and generally for life overseas, it arrangements could be made for providing or subsidising training schools overseas or in this country where they could obtain instruction in general domestic work of the kind which they would have to perform. Many thousands of such women could no doubt be placed in suitable situations throughout the Dominions as soon as shipping space is available for carrying them overseas.25. In all the circumstances the question of the grant of some form of State aid to female emigration appears to be deserving of the closest consideration.   Before any
decision is arrived at there should, of course, be the fullest consultation with the Dominion Governments. It is understood that these Governments have recently been invited by the Secretary of State to furnish suggestions as to the extent to which openings are likely to be available overseas for women emigrants, and particularly for those who during the War have entered upon new spheres of employment in this country, e.g., munitions, land work, including dairy and market gardening, driving motors, &amp;c. It should also be ascertained how far these Governments are prepared to carry out the recommendations contained in paragraphs 18! and 482 of the final Report of the Dominions Royal Commission ; how far it, will he possible to provide in the Dominions through voluntary societies or by direct Government intervention suitable arrangements for the accommodation and protection of women immigrants and for training them in the methods of work overseas ; how far the Dominion Governments are prepared to renew the grant of assisted passages to those who intend to engage in domestic service and also the grant of nominated passages; and what arrangements by way of advances or otherwise-are possible with a view to providing the balance or, in the absence of assisied passages, the whole of the passage money.20. When these facts have been ascertained His Majesty&apos;s Government will be in a position to consider to what extent and in what manner, they should grant State aid to Avomen emigrants either directly or through the medium of women&apos;s and other voluntary emigration societies. &apos; Meanwhile these societies should be encouraged to renew their public spirited activities, to arrange for the i migration of women for whom openings overseas are already available, to think out schemes and programmes for the further expansion of their work, and to consider the question of applying for assistance to the National Relief and other similar funds.27. It is desirable, in passing, to draw attention to the fact that the London College of the Khaki University of Canada, which is the educational service of the C nadian Army, is prepared to assist women in the London area who intend to settle in Canada, by providing them with instruction in Canadian methods of work. No official information is available as to whether the Canadian authorities have considered the question of extending these arrangements to other centres and making them permanent, or whether the other Dominion authorities are prepared to offer facilities of a like nature.Children.28. The emigration of children, though conducted on a small scale, has for many years received assistance from public funds. The children sent out have been mainly (1) orphans and deserted children emigrated by Boards of Guardians, (2 children from reformatories and industrial schools which are under the Home Office, (H, children from schools belonging to voluntary societies. In the first class of cases the cost was defrayed from the rates, in the other two it was met partly from voluntary contributions and partly from Treasury funds.21). Juvenile emigration received the emphatic approval of Lord Tennyson&apos;s Departmental Committee on Agricultural Settlement in British Colonies in 11)0(1. The Dominions Royal - Commission in 1917 reported strongly in favour of the system of migration of State children and urged that more activity was desirable in that direction. The Empire Settlement Committee have advocated the emigration in suitable cases of the widows and the children and of the parentless children of soldiers and sailors.30. Before the War the total annual emigration of State children averaged annually about 750. Taking into account also the emigration of children from schools belonging to voluntary Societies, it is probable that the total number emigrated averaged nearly 3,000 a year. There is clearly room for an extension of this emigration, seeing that the number of State children annually discharged from the various institutions would appear to be upwards of 8,000. Other children in receipt of poor relief numbered upwards of 120,000 in 1917. Of these a large proportion are, no doubt, of the class which might advantageously he emigraied, provided that the consent of their parents could be obtained. This emigration would probably be facilitated if the necessary arrangements were carried out under the general control of the Central Emigration Authority, and if some part of the expenditure were defrayed from the funds of the Authority. Juvenile emigration does, of course, involve careful selection and strict supervision, hut the success of the organisaiion which governs juvenile emigration to Canada would fully justify similar experiments in other parts of the Empire.
31. One special feature may be noted. In the past, though full statistical information is not available, the emigration of boys appears to have been largely in excess of the emigration of girls. Attention should be directed to securing that in future, when the balance has been redressed, the numbers sent out are more nearly equal.   For the present, more girls should, if possible, be emigrated than boys.32. It is therefore recommended (a.) That the system of juvenile emigration and supervision of juvenile emigrants, which is now in existence between this country and Canada, should be further extended, and that the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa should be invited to adopt it:(7).) That the Central Emigration Authority should undertake the general co-ordination and close supervision of the necessary arrangements in this country :(c.) That this extended system of juvenile emigration should be assisted by direct Government grants, to which the Oversea Dominions also might be invited to contribute;(d.) That arrangements should be made in suitable cases for assisting the orphan children of soldiers and sailors to emigrate to the Oversea Doihinions :(e.) That for the present the number of girls emigrated should exceed the number of boys in as high a proportion as possible.[Not?. It will be seen that the above paragraphs have reference to State children or to children under special tutelage. In all other cases it is, of course, best that children should emigrate with their parent?.]III. EX-SERVICE MEN.33. The case of the ex-service men stands on a plane of its own. Here the general economic considerations outlined above are largely subordinated to the direct obligation of giving substantial advantages and the widest possible range of oppor-tunities to the men who have served in the War. This is recognised by all the Governments of the Empire in the treatment of their men. The Dominion Govern-ments and the British Government alike have provided for, or are committed to, considerable schemes of land settlement. The British Government are also providing on a fairly large scale for training. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries proposes to award scholarships to ex-oflicers and men of educational promise who require financial aid to qualify themselves for salaried posts as Agricultural Organisers, Estate Managers, Instructors, &amp;c. The number of such scholarships will be limited by the probable number of vacancies in salaried posts of the nature indicated, and is not likely to exceed 100.-&quot;4. In addition, the Board proposes to give special and direct assistance to ex-officers and men who intend to&apos; settle upon the land in this country and require financial help to be trained. This assistance ranges from allowances of 12;d. per year for two years for selected ex-officers and men of educational promise, while they are learning agriculture with experienced farmers, to a few weeks&apos; training (in the case of the ordinary rank and file) accompanied or followed by employment at the full agricultural rate with selected farmers. Provision in this direction has been made for about 1,000 men of the former class, but the scheme can be expanded according to circumstances.35. So far as the rank and file are concerned, the War Office has made arrangements under which men who are still with the colours can receive agricultural training prior to demobilisation. Four schools are at present available where a total of 1,000 men can be accommodated at one time. Men who have already been demobilised ate being dealt with by the Board of Agriculture, who have already set up eight schools, each capable of receiving fifty men at one time. Both these systems are capable of being extended so as to cope with as many men as may desire to take advantage of the facilities which are offered.3H. Apart from the agricultural scholarships which are to be awarded by the Board of Agriculture as mentioned in paragraph 33, a scheme has been prepared by the Board of Education for giving assistance, up to a maximum of 1T5Z. per annum, plus fees, to suitable ex-service men who are entered at the British Universities, in cases where such men require such assistance to enable them to complete their University course. It is anticipated that the number of those who will be included under this scheme may amount to as many as 17,000.
37. It will naturally be the desire of the British Government in the first instance to give these various advantages and facilities to those who wish to remain at home. We believe, however, that the services contain large numbers of men w ho are determined, in any case, to settle in other parts of the Empire. Many thousands of them are men who would already have emigrated but for the War. In many cases the War has meant the loss of savings accumulated with a view to emigration and subsequent settlement overseas. It would be wholly inconsistent with the principle of giving our ex-service men the widest range of opportunity for improving their individual prospects after the War if we refused them all the assistance they would otherwise be entitled to, unless they remained in the United Kingdom. It seems only equitable that those ex-service men who wish to settle in the Dominions should be, according to their qualifications, entitled to similar assistance to that, which they would have received at home, though not necessarily on as&quot; substantial a scale.38. The argument on the ground of equity is reinforced by practical considerations. The immediate future will necessarily be a period of industrial unsettlement. It may not, prove possible for home industry and agriculture to absorb all the men whose place has to so large an extent been filled up during the War. hoi- a year or two there will be a serious shortage of housing accommodation, not least in agricul-tural districts. The facilities for agricultural training may -well prove insufficient for the total number of men willing to settle on the land at home or overseas. The acquisition of land for small holdings, involving the displacement of existing farmers and the training of the newr small holders, must inevitably be a gradual process. Universities and Technical and Agricultural Colleges in this country are likely to be overcrowded for some years to come. All these considerations make it prudent as well as just that the generosity of the State to those who have served it wrell should be extended, in some measure at any rate, to those of them who wish to acquire a new domicile, though not a new allegiance, in some other part of the Empire.o9. We consider that as a recognition of the war services of the fighting forces of this country, His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the policy favoured by the Empire Settlement Committee in paragraph 123 of their Report that those who have served in the present War should be allowed to claim within a reasonable time, say three years after their release from service, and subject to the limitation mentioned in the following sentence, free transport for themselves and their dependents to any destination within the British Empire. In order, however, to avoid a mere stimulation of emigration in an undesirable form, this privilege should be strictly confined to bond fide settlers on the land, or to those who can prove that they have a definite offer of other suitable employment.10. Facilities for education and for technical and agricultural training, similar to those to be afforded to ex-service men of suitable qualifications in this country, should also be afforded by His Majesty&apos;s Government to any such men who would prefer to undertake studies or training of a like kind in some other part of the Empire, whether at Dominion universities or agricultural colleges or in training with farms overseas. The financial assistance given need not necessarily be so substantial as that afforded to those who take advantage of the facilities offered in this country. It is possible, however, that the Dominion and State or Provincial Governments and educational authorities, whose concurrence and co-operation it would naturally be essential to secure before any such scheme could be given effect to; might be willing to supplement the financial assistance given by the British Government to men of this class.II. Whatever assistance in the way of advances, etc., is given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to men who settle upon the land in this country, similar assistance to the extent of, say, one-half should be given, through the Oversea Governments and by way of loan to those Governments, to or in respect of those who are accepted as suitable for settlement upon the land overseas.42. No action will, of course, be possible in connection with land settlement overseas until the Dominion Governments have been fully consulted in the matter. The details of any schemes which may be in contemplation wili have to be worked out in co-operation and agreement with them, and it will be specially necessary to ascertain such points as the extent of the capital required by each individual settler, the arrangements for training the men before they take up their holdings, and the various dates at which the authorities overseas will be prepared to receive settlers for training and for actual settlement.It must be admitted that there is little detailed information as to the situation and quality of the lands offered to ex-service men under the special schemes of the Oversea Governments which are set out in the report of the Empire Settlement
Committee, and are epitomised in the recently published &quot; Statement for the use of ex-service officers and men who may wish to emigrate after the War.&quot; But in view of the fact that a considerable period of preliminary training overseas is essential for all settlers, the absence of detailed information is probably less important than it would seem to be at first sight. In any case the schemes of the Oversea (Governments are primarily applicable to their own ex-service men as well as to those From this country, and it may be presumed that they accept full responsibility for the suitability of the lands offered.43. Finally it is recommended that if any of the Dominions see lit to adopt the suggestion made by the Empire Settlement Committee in paragraph 131 of their report (Cd. 8672), and submit schemes for development which would afford employment and settlement for ex-service men from the United Kingdom equally with those of the Dominions in question, His Majesty&apos;s Government should favourably consider the possibility of advancing any reasonable sums for carrying such schemes into effect.In this connection it may be desirable to consider to what extent, if at all, the machinery of demobilization, i.e., troop ships returning to the Dominions, can be used for the carriage of ex-service emigrants from this country ; or how far a limited number of such emigrants could be attached to the Dominion Forces before demobilization, and could have the advantage of the training for land settlement overseas which is, or can be given, by the Khaki University of Canada at various military centres here and in France, by the Australian military authorities on Salisbury Plain, and by the New Zealand authorities at their agricultural training depots at Torquay and elsewhere. It is also desirable to consider the possibility of making arrangements for the commuting of pensions of partially disabled and long service men in connection with the proposed land settlement schemes.44. The problem of the emigration of ex-service men is very largely an agricultural one. How far ex-service men as a class will prove suitable for an agricultural life is by no means certain. Military service is not altogether an ideal form of training for a career of land settlement. There are indications that soldiers who have gone back to the self-governing Dominions show no strong or immediate desire to return to the land. These, however, were largely disabled men, and it may reasonably be expected that a ceitain proportion of ex-service men will possess the qualities requisite for success overseas, either as agricultural settlers or in such suitable openings as may be available. It is only in so far as they possess these quahties, that the Government will be justified, either in its own interest or in theirs, in encouraging or assisting their emigration.15. The chances of suceessforex service settlers should he increased by the adoption of some system of &quot; Comrade Settlements.&quot; Such a system, for which the soldiers life is a suitable training, and which appeals to his love of comradeship, might be organised by some responsible body, such as a Divisional Comrades&apos; Association, which would select a nucleus of officers and men to act as the pioneers and leaders of each settlement. It is essential that these men if approved by the Dominion authorities should be sent out well in advance to obtain local experience to fit themselves to assist in training and settling the community on its arrival. In other cases such a community might arise more informally by the action of a few officers and men, who, after gaining their experience and- finding their feet, invited other settlers to join them through the military or naval associa-tions to which they belong. No system of community settlement should, however, be so rigid as to interfere with the absorption of the settlers into the general population. It is worth noting that the New Brunswick Government deiinitely contemplates schemes of settlement in communities of from 100 to 250 families.IV.-FOREIGN COUNTRIES.46. Tt is recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adhere to the policy which was pursued by the Committee of the Emigrants&apos; Information Office of furnishing intending emigrants with authentic information with regard to foreign countries, though such information should, as in the past, be more limited in extent than that supplied with regard to the British Empire. All reasonable steps should be taken to encourage British subjects to remain within the Empire, in accordance Avith the resolution passed by the Imperial War Conference in July 1918, but it is unlikely that this end Avould be attained by withholding information in regard to foreign countries. Every British subject who may contemplate emigration is entitled to be furnished with the best available information in regard to any part of the world to which he may intend to proceed. The information furnished in regard to foreign countries will, presumably, as in the past, be derived through the appropriate official channels.
V.-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.47. To sum up our conclusions, Ave consider : 1. That the migration of population from the United Kingdom to other parts of the Empire is calculated to promote the economic strength and the well-being of the Empire as a whole, and of the United Kingdom in particular, provided that the flow at any time is not m excess of what the industries of the United Kingdom can afford to spare or in excess of what the Dominions can conveniently absorb ;2. That in order to secure this object, it is essential that full and accurate information as to the conditions and prospects throughout the Empire should be widely disseminated, and that reasonable safeguards should be provided against the dissemination of deliberately misleading information ;3. That there is, at present, no sufficient reason for the direct grant of State aid to emigration in general, beyond the aid involved in the improvement and cheapening of inter-Imperial communications ; fc4. That there are, however, special grounds for granting State aid to the emigration of women, and for supplementing the existing provision for the emigration of juveniles, more particularly of girls, by direct Government grants ;5. That ex-service men who wish to go to other parts of the Empire, and are either bond-fide settlers on the land or have definite offers of other suitable employ-ment, should be entitled, within three years of their demobilization, to a free passage to their destination for themselves and their dependents ;6. That whatever financial assistance for the purpose of general or technical education or agricultural training is afforded to selected classes of ex-service men in the United Kingdom, similar assistance should be afforded, though not necessarily on as substantial a scale, to men of the same type who prefer to avail themselves of such opportunities elsewhere in the Empire ;7. That whatever financial assistance is afforded by way of advances to selected ex-service men to facilitate settlement upon the land in this country, similar advances should be made to the responsible authorities in the Dominions in respect of such men if they prefer to avail themselves of the facilities for land. settlement offered overseas, but that such advances should not, as a rule, exceed half the sums advanced in the case of men taking up holdings under similar conditions in this country ;8. That all arrangements with regard to emigration should be subject to the closest consultation and. co-operation with the responsible Government authorities in the several Dominions;9. That, whilo there should be no encouragement given to emigration outside the British Empire, emigrants who contemplate settling in foreign countries should be furnished with accurate information, though such information should be more limited in extent than that provided with regard to the British Empire.February, 1919.o
