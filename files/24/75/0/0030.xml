(Note by Chairnan of the Committee)

The War Cabinet decided on the 14th? February 1919 that as Chairman of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee I was to have full powers of decision in the matter of War Gratuities to men in receipt of Pension and Pay concurrently (War Cabinet 533 (4))

The question was considered at a Meeting of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee held this morning when it was decided:-

That pensioners in the non-commissioned ranks should receive the full monthly increment but that in so far as the commissioned ranks are concerned it is not desirable to make any change as the result of this decision.(Sd.) Auckland Godd?s.
