TO BRITISH INDUSTRIES DURING THE PERIOD OE RECONSTRUCTION.(Memrrandum by the Chairman of&apos; the Eederaticn of &apos;pri 1&apos;ih Indu&quot;sTrl&quot;ea)&apos;7The Federation of British Industries desire to urge upon the Government the necessity of giving every possible assistance to Industry in overcoming the difficulties in reconstruction and in retraining and developing its pre-war activity.They would remind the Government that the whole prosperity *ff the oountry and with it both employment and the -national revenue depend ultimately on the wellbein^ of Industry.At the present moment Industry is facing aerious Labour unrest, general disorganisation consequent onrthe reversion from Tar to peace, high prices of raw material,, shortage of transport and of almost every other.facility, the necessity in all businesses of the employment&quot;of a greatly increased working oapital to meet the increased cost of labour, machinery and raw material, and in many cases the certainty of heavy direct losses due to the after effects of war conditions and of.war taxation.The result of the absence of any declared and generous policy on the part of the Government is already seen in a general loss of confidence,, in the postponement of many develop-ments already planned, and in a gradually spreading stagnation whirh Till soon reach serious proportions with accompanying unemployment and loss of revenue.-The Eederation^desire to warn His MajestyTs Government that any further delay in dealing on broad and generous lines with the pr sent situation may bring the most disastrous conse-quenoes.Above all they would urge them not to place the immediate needs of the revenue above the paramount necessity of reocnstruc-ting the productive power from which this revenue is derived.   If the reconstitution of Industry is impeded during the next few oritical years for the sake of saving a few millions of expendi-turo or obtaining a fev extra millions cf revenue, the result will be the loss of hundreds nf millions in the years which follow, when our f orei ;n; markets and possibly even our hsme markets will have been captured by competitors whose industries have been enabled to recover more rapidlyThe Federation desire to reiterate the principal measures which in their opinion are essential if Industry is to be enabled to overcome successfully the difficulties which confront it in the immediate future.These are1e    In Regard to taxation.(a) A substantial reduction in the rate at which Excess Profits -duty is levied, but with retention, cf the right to recover losses incurred during the accounting period.(b) 1 revision for revising the datum line in thoo* numerous cases where the present datum line is causing injustice and hardship.
o(o)   Provision for spreading the payment of Exoess profitB Duty over a number of years, with the payment of interest on the unpaid pCrBtion.(dj   The allowance out of Excess profits Duty of all ex-penoes incurred in the rearrangement of existing plant from a war to a peace foot in,;, and that where buildings havo to bor altered back to their previous condition, the same provision should be applied.(e) An allowance for special depreciation to be made cut of Excess profits Duty free of Income Tax to meet the oa3e of extensions of buildings and plant for peace purposes on the same i basis a* that granted in respect of buildings or plant erected for war purposes;   provided suoh extensions are undertaken within a reasonable time.(f) That in the cases covered by (b) and (o) above where Extess profits have not been earned cr are not sufficient, an equivalent- or supplementary&apos;..ailowanoe should be granted by the State;(g) That ample reserves should be allowed to be retained for the depreoiatian cf. stocks in assessing Excess Profits Duty.In regard to other measures;(a) That the Treasury and the purchasing Departments of His Majesty&apos;8 Government should settle the Governments accounts with manufaoturera at the earliest possible date.     until this is done manufacturers cannot estimate their financial position and the conversion of Industry from War to Peace footing is in consequence being seriously impeded.(b) That the system of prohibition and restriction of exports be abolished wherever practicable at the earliest possible moment and that every effort be made to seoure tonnage for export at rates whioh will enable British manufacturers to -compete favourably in foreign markets.(*)   That the Government should at onoe plaoe as many prospective orders as possible, subject to adjustment in regard to prioes, should this, prove necessary, and that they should press British overseas Governments and other large purchasers to do the same:In.regard to fina.no.ial facilities.(a) That the Government should be prepared to give liberal financial and other assistance to any sound British enterprise of public utility at home jr abroad, whioh is prepared to purchase British products, on a large ssale;(b) That when permission is granted for the issue of new capital, a preference should be given to all British, or. approved foreign, persons, firms, companies or corporations which are pre-pared to undertake to buy all the manufactured material required by them from   British producers;(c) That for the present no new issue of capital at all should be allowed unless an undertaking is given that at least fifty per cent of the orders for manufactured material   which will be placed as a consequence of the issue of   capital, shall be placed in the United Kingdom, and that the Government should take steps,  by legislation or otherwise,, to see that the under-takings indicated above are strictly carried out,
As His Maj; sty&apos;s Treasury must n.-.cessarily bo principally preoccupied with raising th-.. maximav r*7*.inue .and s*.curing the; minimum of isxpenditur.-*, it appears to thi Fedf.r-c.tion th-t it is a, most unsuitable Department to be- tha. final authority in abnormal times for the administration of r-.lit-.-f -.nd assistance to Industry or other inter-, sts.They would tht-rt for?, propose that 4 further authority which might be either a Committee of tht Cabinet or a Com -ittse of both Houses of Parliament should be set up, to which either the Departments, such as thfi Board of Trade, who arc ch-rged with the protection of the intrrests of Industry, or the reprcsanta-tivc bodies of the various trades themselves might appeal in cases involving relief or n.s.assistance.*Pnhruary&apos;  1919.In,,regard to pre-Wrr &amp; Early War Contracts with Overseas. purchasers. where owing to war conditions and consequent (jrovtrrmc-iY; action it has not been possible for contractors to fulfil their obligations,(a)   It should be recognised that it is in the national interests that such contracts should now be oonpleted at the price agreed upon, if a compromise cannot be reached, more especially having regard to the extreme  eoirabi&amp;ity of maintaining good and friendly relations between British Manufacturers and Overseas Customers,Provision should bt made therefore that(l)   In cases where it can be shown that no understanding or compromise can be arrived at as b*twe*n thr contractor and th* purehas*r, it shall be acc pt-*d that th* whol- loss incurred in the completion of th* contract owing to thw -change in conditions or to the increase in th&quot; cost of manufacture should b* admitted as a. r*bat* from any E.P.D, which may have been paid; or in cas^s of firms who may not havft earned any or sufficient E.P.D, compensation for such loss shall be made by the Gov^rnm^nt.(2)   That in oases where contracts have already been &quot;completed at a loss, owing to Government action, such loss Bhould be reimbursed in a similar manner,(3)   That in cases which have suffered or will suff t some measure of loss throurh th&apos;1 fulfilment of contracts cas th* result Of compromise between th** parties, th-1 same relief should be given,(4-)   That a special Tribunal be appointed to consider individual ease?, with .pow*r to adjudicate on the merits of nach *laim submitted for admission to the benftfits above referred to.The Federation are fully aware that these proposals may involve a reduction of Immediate revenue,   They are convinced however that their adoption would so hasten the re00very and development of Industry, and the resumption of an active export tr de th&quot;-t any temporary loss to the exchequer would   rvpidly . be more th-.n recouped.In conclusion the Federation desire to v.- ..rn the Government most solemnly of the r,pp&apos;-..lling responsibility which they rill assume if by neglecting to give timely h&amp;aistance and relief to Industry, they,prevent or even ret ..rd its recovery and thus not only involve the exchequer in losses incomparably gre ter in extent th..n any *hich can be caused by even the most lavish assistance at the present time, but inflict upon the country social and economic distress of a oh:&apos;.r cter from which it may n*- ver r-co-&apos; r,IM BY W!--1 OH THE ABOVE PROPOSALS SHOULL BE CAR-UKD OUT...
