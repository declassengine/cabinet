I desireto make two comments on the last paragraph but one.(l) The War Cabinet ought to be made aware that com-pletely friendly arrangement?, have been made, for car-&apos;rying on &apos;ad interim&apos; with the Board of agriculture for England and Wale?, in accordance with the WarCabinet&apos;s instruct!ons, and that similar arrangements are on the very point of completion with the Secre-tary for Scotland.   Mr. Sutherland, who would beAssistant Commissioner for Scotland, is at presentdoing that work in his capacity as officer of the Scot-tish Board, and in hi a work is keeping in close touchboth with the Board and with the Interim Authority.&apos;This arrangement is likely to work perfectly well.(2) The Interim Authority is not taking over thepowers of the Development Commission.   They have made arrangements with the Development Commission underwhich the Commission consults the Authority before torecommending/the Treasury any forestry schemes.The Authority have recently approved several Bchejiesthus referred to them by the Commission,   This arrange-ment also, as an interim arrangement, is quite satis-factory.The decision of the War Cabinet might possibly be simplified if I were allowed to attend when the Treasury minute is under discussion.26th February 1919.(3d)   F.D.
