Cingl dentl^3J fPolitical Intelligence Department, i^^^frtetoary 18th, 1919) f[^A?7^^ FOREIGN 01&apos;FIOE./ 68 5&quot;t      ) I] Japan / 003,^iyj MEMORANDUMJAPAJE8E ACTIVITY IN SIBERIA..endBBOOGNITION Off THE, OMSK GOVERNMENT.The following, memorandum is in continuation of Memorandum Japan /002 on the -Japanese flole in the Intervention in Siberia. In that memorandum, the position was adopted that the Japanese attitude in Siberia had not always been transparent, that there had been conflict from time to time between tho utterances of Tokyo.&apos;and the activities of tho Japanese representatives in Siberia, and that it was doubtful whether the Japanese consider-ed the Question of intervention in Siberia in the same frank and disinterested manner as the ether Allies.    Definite proof for tho above position was givon in the account of tho earlier relations of the Japanese with Semenoff, and the unnecessarily complicated and ambiguous role which they played in connection with the Allied landing at Vladivostok In the summer, of 1918. It was pointed out in connection with tho scheme for economic relief that while the purposa of the other Allies was to avoid any suspicion that they were participating in the exploitation if the economic necessities of Siberia for private1 gain, the Japanese from the first used every effort to secure valuable rightB and concessions of all kinds.    Already, in September, 1910, the Commander-in-Chief of the Czecho-Slovak forces had stated that the Japanese troops were not ingratiating them-selves with the natives owing do their high-handed behaviour/and
and that it was their intention simply to weaken Russia.

Recent developments do not furnish ground for adopting a more favourable view of the situation. On the contrary, the statement may now be defended that from the time of the negotiations preceding the landing of the Allied troops at Vladivostok last summer, up till the present time, the Japanese have never worked in whole-hearted unity with the rest of the Allies. Continually they have raised objections, or seized on any indication of slight differences between the other Allies, to impede the general movement towards the restoration of a central control in Siberia. This attitude of non-commital and aloofness, together with their persistent introduction of reservations has been carried even into the preliminary discussions in Paris on the subject of the League of Nations, - their reservations had actually to be minuted (see Conference Report in looe?). Accordingly, it seems more than ever important to try and understand the policy that lies behind the data accumulated through different channels.

Stating in general terms, I believe that we are justified in thinking (1) That Japan is not sincerely with the other Allies. The defeat of the Germans has on the whole been rather a disappointment to her since it leaves her without any sufficient counterpoise to Anglo-American domination and puts her therefore at a discount. Accordingly she does not wish to be too closely committed to the Allies, desiring freedom to work against them when it suits her purpose, and even to work with Germany and Russia should reach an arrangement give her greater scope: (2) That purpose is hegemony in the Far East and recognition of her as the guardian of the Yellow Races, together with acknowledgment of preferential rights in China. (3) So far as Siberia is concerned

the

-2-
the first,,stage;in hO: activity was to. leoure her hold upon Eastern Siberia and after that had boen put in process, to turn her attention to&apos; Westfrn Siberia.     (4)   This raises the questions!&apos; the, etatU8*6f the Omsk Government and the Japanese -relationship to it. * It will be noted that part of the Japan-esu. method is t%ke^p1 things in a ferment and turmoil, ana as in conditions of plastioity and fluidity, it. is easier to push forward with a definite polioy, even following up linos-if action that temporarily run countor to her main idea for pur-poses of decep^.i*n. and drep-oing them later as soon as the main purpose is secured,-i Japan is so materialistic and self-seek-ing that the formation  End &quot;pursuit of a policy is a simpler matter for her tfoanHt is for her more disinterested Allies. This dtes net mean that, individuals with another outleek art* - *- -     - ,      . &quot;not to he founjL in her political and governmental life, but...     m ,     f\.thoy are younger men and have not as yet the influence to withstand the Genri.\* *  :The evidence adduced here in support of (1) is taken from a series.of recent reports frtm M. I. lot especially 02 065D28 flovembor 30th).    The signing of the armistice at-oording to these accounts was announced at Kobo about noon on November 12th, but it was net &quot;until the evening of the;*13th November that a few hundred school boys ana,, perhaps one hundred men had,the*courage (?) to light lanterns and forma parade through the . stre ets................    A few daysprevious to the signing of the armistice the &quot;Chugai Shogyo&quot;, an organ of the Japanese Military Party, was Still ocnvinoed that &apos;the Germans are^far more defeated:   the armistice is only intended to restore the badly: shaken morale of the Ger-man troops1.    Another theory, expounded at tho timo, was as follows:-    &apos;The Germans had concluded an arrangement with the U.S.A.. who would not &apos;permit Germany to suffer from/tho
the time had -oome-tro-hLedge, &quot;brought forward the excuse that &quot;Ger-many is still a great nation and the Allies are no better than Germany.i     One paper, the Kokumin, proclaimed the greatness of the Germans in defeat, pointing out that * Germany had fought the whole world, thus giving a great and1 valuable lesson to ether nations.    Their defeat will give them a brighter future thanwiinwiMimiiiii mm vjuibhj.P iniiisuccess.&apos;Tokyo received the news of thr signing of the armistice in the same manner as Osaka and Kobe:   it was the must depressing news they had received for some years.    The German defeat was known in the capital of Japan at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, November 12th, but during the entire day and night there was not a single sign of rejoicing or satisfaction in the entire city.   The next day a few street cars pluckily displayed the Japanese fla&amp;^and reluctantly a few householders followed suit.     It -as so badly disguised, ** this sorrow at the- defeat of Germany, - that the leading foreign newspaper in Tokyo, &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, after a strongly worded article on the subject, ended up as follows: iftven with due allowance for the national custom of waiting for the word, it is not quite possible to explain Tuesday^ lethargy and yesterday&apos;s modified manifestations of joy:   all the slabor-at ion in the world later on, will not make up for the want ef spontaneity tn the day of the great news.............. 1&quot;The Tokyo &quot;Asahi&quot; had to admit the truth of the state-ment that many Japanese were sad when the news came that Ger-many accepted the terms of the armictice.     On 3ovember 22n/i,it commented as follows;    put we approve of the fact thatthere were men among our -mmm^^wm who, individually or in&apos;^2gf^^!PfeiM^lg WW^^ttJ the foreign mind that the 4^$^-^ would not be very4ajmiL.%A-haftir the news of the J\XXA^&apos;^P^^^   The writer- &apos;.      - of-4-
of this report adds that the "Asahi" knows full well that there are more than a few individuals and a few groups who are pre-German to-day, but states that the effect of the German defeat in business circles is very marked, prices having, tumbled in all directions. He took part in the official peace, celebrations (at Kobe?) on November 26th, visiting the crowds in front of the British and American Consulates. "As each Section of the lantern procession? came to the Consulate, it ?, the &apos;cheers&apos; at neither place were the &apos;real thing&apos;, but this is certain, Great Britain is less &apos;feared&apos; than America and the general run of the crowd was more friendly to the British flag than to the American........ I did not see a single outward expression of animosity to Germany, and for the odd Germans I met here and there in the crowd there was nothing for them to object to, in the pretty lantern parade: there was nothing anywhere that the most German professor in Kai? University could object to. It was just a nice pleasant gathering at the end of the war." The most favourable symptoms that he noticed were the slight changes for the better in the deference of the crowd to foreigners as a while.

Amongst the converse lines of evidence are the various indications of sympathy with the German prisoners in Siberia and Japan (see Mr. Als? 175 to F.?. 23/10/18), the most extreme example of which was the permission given to interned German prisoners to hold a public exhibition of handicraft at Band? (see Greene 837 August 31st, 1918). On the general subject, the writer of the report already quoted considers it advisable to call for the repatriation of all the so-called "interned" Germans in Japan as well as prisoners of war. He writes "that Germans walk about the Treaty Ports of Japan in full pre-war arrogance and new clothes; they seem to have plenty of money and live well, and only wait

/for

-5-
for tho word to recommence business with anti-British prop-agenda.&quot;    He points out the danger to British trade in al-Xowing them to start up again in business in open competition. &quot;During the War the prisoners have studied the Japanese language and the &apos;interned&apos;- have kept in close business touch with their Japanese friends.     All this time, our trade v/ith Japan has been almost at a standstill, it is true, hut we have lost many men from the Last v:ho had more than a fair knowledge of the requirements of the Japanese markets.   The Germans lost a few of their Japan men at Tsingtau and many others were taken prisoners.     If the prisoners are all re-patriated with the&apos; &apos; interned J we should get a fairer start with the trade again..&quot;    The; --/hole Japanese attitude to this question, seems to be a fair indication of their real feelings.Some of the evidence for (2) has been already given in P.I.B.. memorandum Japan /OOl.     It has come out more and more in connection v-itii press discussions of Japanese expectations with regard to the Peace Conference.-    Again and again for example,, it is emphasised that only japanV relations with Germany can be reviewed there;   her.nego** tiations with China are her own affair, which cannot be submitted for general    ecussi on.   . Evidence of their in-contentions may also be seen in connection vith the prepara-tiona that they have made to remain in Tsingtau.The evidence in connection with (3)8 derived from both H..1.1c and F.O. telegrams, is no1- voluminous and. from this end it is perhaps a little difficult to appraise the value of the different elements in it.    The following selectiondeals
 060070 l&amp;divo stoic (12/18G&amp;67X8 MUvostck 1/18deals in the first instance with steps taken to secure the Japanese position in Eastern Siberia.    this policy was based on the encouragement of.&quot;Ataman china&quot; - i.e. sup-port by money and arms of local Lcentre* off authority - (of l^cal Atamans) * for example, Semenoff, Korvat and Kalmi-koffj v/hich militate^ against any idea of united action on the part of the Allies.    This was conducted by the Japanese under the plausible pretext that it was not po.tr-sible at present to institute one strong central gevern-ment in Siberia an^ that the best method was to ensure stable local centres whioh could be united later.   Thus&quot;Kalmikoff has lately grants--! concessions to Japan in the Ussuri country.&quot;A telegram &quot;as received by horvat from the Russian I&amp;ribassy at Tokyo on the 27th November saying that Japan &apos; will boost Semenoff and Kalmikoff, but ohly on the condi-tion that horvat is recognioed as Dictator.     Japan will then help the Cossacks with arms, equipment and stores.&quot;Japan is said to be preventing the transport of arms westward in Siberia, as this vould help to restore order in Kuesia.     There seeing no doubt that Japan is fomenting trouble.&apos;1&quot;Japan sent a special envoy a few days ago to horvat&apos; to promise the authorities military &quot;support should he pro-claim himoelf Dictator.     Japan requires concessions as compensation. M&quot;Jaoanm   7   -

&quot;The Admiral is aware of this and is very hitter against Japan.&quot;&quot;The Japanese are almost universally unpopular and in some places the population is hostile.     The Japanese are however ingratiating themselves with semenoff&apos;s and Koltchak*e Cossacks, and in the famine-stricken districts around Chita and Irjsutsh where they have undersold all the tradesmen in food, due to the Japanese use of military trains carrying goods freight and duty free.&quot;With Semenoff and the others securely under Japaneseicontrol,. - their relation to, and demands in connection with Semenoff being very different from the relation of the other Allied representatives to Koltchak, - a more -detailed system of penetration could be undertaken with comparative ease.&quot;There is a complete change in Japanese policy which now proposes to leave Siberia but to hold the Lanchurian railway with the object of influencing China, whose alli-ance ia -sought against the U.S.A.&quot;henceforward Japan will 1 ork through her Secret Ser-vice to support the Bolsheviks with the object of foment-ing riots.&quot;The Army and Javy will be increased, and when condi-tlons are favourable, troops will be sent on the pretext of quelling disorder and defending Japanese subjects.    They hope thus to annex more of Siberian territory&quot;.&apos;&quot;Their former aggressive attitude is no\) abandoned and great efforts are being made to conciliate Russia.&quot;Freem    9   -     &quot;
V, /\&quot;Ifree gif3$/a&apos;re made to the people by the Japanese k-s-eipn, members of which are of the Orthodox Russian Religion. Special trains are sent, along the Amur Railway with gi^ijs.&quot;wherever Japanese soldiers have stationed themselves, articles are sold at very lo. rates.&quot;The Grand hotel at Harbin, also sereral flour mi lie onthe Amur and Harbin have been purchased &quot;by the Jaoanese attremendous premiums. - 2!hey have also bought several elec-tric stations in Siberian towns, while gold mines on theAmur and Sia are under.the control of their troops.&quot;074 &quot;The Japanese Secret Service agents have received in-ost ok &apos;19 structions, bo establish friendly relations with the RussianZemstvo in Siberia and they are using Russian agents for this purpose&apos;.     They are interested in the ideas and fi-financial position of the Zemstvo and in its character and political sympathies, particularly with regard to the 3oI-bolshevism of its Chairman.     Anticipating a sudden swing to the Left from the present reactionary policy in Siberia, the Japanese are befriending the Socialist element and some-times appearing as bogus Japanese Revolutionists-&quot;The Japanese are interested in the condition of the Vladivostok Fortress, and number of guns, etc     It is cer-tain that this country will be occupied by them.    They are instituting enquiries about ilicolaievsk on the Amur and are collecting a fleet in anticipation of the opening of navigation on the Amur.&quot;&quot;hile the Japanese are loudly advertising the return of half of their troops, they are only returning those men whose
Y/hose service has expired and intend to replace them v/ith recruits to he trained by the men now here.     Siberia&apos;s position as regards the number of Japanese troops will be the same.&quot;The Japanese have (?bribed) the Chief of the Amur Railway with three hundred thousand yen and display great interest in Kamchatka, where, with Russian assistance they are buying up the best properties.&quot;LavroV, the President of the Russian Fisheries Ad-ministration is a Japanese agent, and is arranging that Japan only shall have the fish industry.     He is now sell-ing them the rights in the Peter the Great Gulf which is near the local fort, and he is granting twelve year con-cessions to certain Russians selected by the Japanese.&quot;A final despatch from the same source may be given infullA.        &quot;In consequence of the AsLliesT declaration (re Prinkipo)., the Japanese Staff is very busy among the Russia officers spreading the view that the Allies have deserted Russia.     They urge the Russians to come to an agreement with Japan under which. Japan would guarantee to employ sufficient force to cruch the Bolsheviks throughout Rus-sia in two months.     Japan thereafter would support the restoration of the konarchy.     Nothing definite vas said about the terms of the agreement proposed, but considering the previous Japanese efforts to secure control of the railway and telegraph system to the Urals, it is obvious that their military intervention in. Russia proper wouldinvolve
involve such, control.     Doubtless there would be other conditions relative to-l;lie.Ch:bi^seO^ theposition of the Japanese in Siberia and liberty of &quot;action in Chin.-i so far as Russia is concerned.B. The Admiral says that in view of recent Allied declarations, these proposals are making a great impres-sion in military circles, and I have reliable knowledge that the subject is being generally- discussed here.An intelligent business man tells me it is common talk here that if the Allies do not adopt a different atti-tu^e towards the Russian situation, Russia will be com-pelled to accept Japanese assistance.     He specially urged that Great Britain should act independently if the Allies would not move.     He said that the majority of Russians are dead against Japanese assistance, but that many feel it would be better to make a bargain v/ith Japan than to continue to struggle single-handed against the Bolsheviks.The Admiral says practically the same, adding that the prospect of restoring the monarchy specially appeals to military men.The Admiral also saio he knew that several Russian officers have gone to the front to advocate an arrange-ment with Japan, ana that he regards the situation as so disquieting that he contemplates himself going to the front immediately in order to counteract their activi-ties.C. As regards his personal relations with the Japanese, he says that, they have ceaeed direct communication with him since he turned down their railway proposition, andthat
that they are oontinually trying to undermine him amongst hie ova officers.     He nov learns that Admiral Tanpka, his personal friend, who was attached to him in the Black Sea, is now travelling here, and he presumes that the Jep-anese intend trying through this man to get into closer touch with him.D. A Russian in whom I have great confidence says he thinks that the Admiral&apos;s life is in dagger, as many offi-cers around him regard him as an obstacle to the fulfil-&quot;ment of their desire to restore the Monarchy, because he Will never make any agreement with the Japanese who are r^eady to forward their wishes.     He also says it is doubt-ful whether the Admiral will be allowed to proceed to the jpront.E. It is hardly necessary to say that the best way to strengthen the Admiral, who, above all favours Great Bri-tain and has confidence in the British and believes they, will ultimately help Russia against the; Bolsheviks, is for Great Britain to move the Allies to take action.The Admiral believes that if the Allies agree to intervene and say so plainly without delay, the Japanese schemes will be defeated.&quot;It is probable that many of the above selections are of unequal value, but the general tendency of the whole is not obscure.     It is natural for Koltchak in his own in-terests to play off the Japanese against the Allies.   The unsatisfactory feature in the situation however is that it&apos;.,.bas been poosible for him to do so.   The practical question continually arises as to the advisability of recognising
recognising the Omsk Government cie facto.    About Kol-tchak It is probably true that he us not Monarchist and only mildly reactionary, but the evidencetends to show that he is surrounded by a group of officers whose in-clinations are decidedly reactionary, and who would pro-bably get rid of him in some way later on if he proved inconvenientj after they naa attained a measure of suc-cess against the Bolsheviks under his leadership.     If we are to grant recognition to Koltchak1e Government we shall have to come to some decision at the same time as to what is involved in that recognition^, for it should not be forgotten that the Omsk Government claims to be in touch with General Judenitch., who &quot;in planning to take command of a small detachment of Me si an troops in Esathonia without any recognition of the Provisional government there, while Prince Lievenra another Russian officer commanding Bait forces in Latvia, is also vait-ing an opportunity to declare his leadership as un;ier Koltchak.     Denikin has also acknowledged Koltchak&apos;s supremacy:,, while at the same time he tends to use his forces against the Georgians and Daghestani to the East and South, rather than against the Bolsheviks in sup-port of Krasnoff.     In shorty if and while recognising Koltchak&apos;s Government, we ought also to strictly delimit the conditions under which we recognise it, after having decided v/hether we are in favour with the French Govern-ment of restoring an indivisible and united Russia, or of simply assisting the Russians to find thai feet whileguaranteeing
guaranteeing aut on economy or la&amp;e 0n4en^)%^ rum-Slav peoples from Helsingfors to Baku.     If Koltchak. falls, - and his position Is daily &quot;becoming more insecure - the anti-3olshovik elements v/ill probably turn to Japan in despair.
