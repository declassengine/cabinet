(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic majesty&apos;3 Government.) B C E II IS &quot;     &quot;LO 0 4 1.1 B $T,-:6805.. &apos;        &quot; &quot;A j^SggB....... 9iJgX 3 Russia,(7**&quot;- flfciflp tt &quot;by the Chief of the uImperialtGeneral^ Staffs ..In accordance with paragraph 4, War Cabinet 531, I submit the following statement with regarft to Allied policy in Russia. Time has not permitted of any detailed scheme being worked out, and the following is to be regarded merely as a summary of general principles,,1* Wki-1-3 &quot;there was a period.about the 1st Septemberof last &quot;year &quot;&quot;when effective intervention on a decisive scale could have been carried out from Siberia, it is universally admitted that, under present conditions, the employment of large Allied forces for an offensive campaign in Russia is impracticable. It is, therefore, unnecessary to discuss this further,,2C EVACUATION.    A decision to withdraw completely from Russia not only The small Allied forces at present employed there, but all assistance in the way of supplies, equipment and munitions^ would be tantamount to disowning the anti-Bolsherik cause0   The moral effect of this would inevitably bring complete disaster on all the forces of law and order which are at present struggling to prevent the. spread of anarchy*     The strength of the Bolshevik forces would be proportionately enhanced, and there is little doubt but that they would completely overrun and submerge the new States., such as Esthonia, Poland, and Georgia that are now struggling for their existence, and which.the Allies have under-taken to supporto3* KBCOGHTOION AKD MATERIAL oUPPOKP.     On the other hand, the yqtj fact c&quot;f Allied recognition and&apos; support being openly given to the anti-Bolshevik cause would at once raise the moral of the l&amp;t^er a hundred per cent.   The fighting efficiency of the Russian forces ist at the present moment, susceptible to the influence of moral to an exceptional degree, and the slightest impetus to either side produces effects out of all proportion to the magnitude of the effort.   It may be said that the disappointment and discouragement of the Prinkipo demarche has done much to bring about the withdrawal of General Zraznov!s forces to the Don as this retirement has been almost entirely due to propaganda and not to any successful military operations on the part ox the Bolsheviks..     If supplies, equipment,and munitions, together with a comparatively small number of tanks and aeroplanes,, manned by volunteer specialists, are sent it will at least enable the Bolsheviks to be held and confined within their present limits., This means&apos;their ultimate collapse, since.Bolshevism, which can produce nothing, can exist only by extending its system of organ-ized rapine into fresh territory.4. TIE jWMCE O-i1 THE EMBRYO bTATES.     As already indicated t^ policy of abandonment of the anti-Bolshevik cause must inevitably mean the destruction of EoTHOMa and POIoND, which the Allied and Associated Powers have undertaken to support.   On the other handa if definite recognition is given by the Allies to the anti-Bolshevik cause, end all available material provided for their equipment it would be possible for these states at least to protect their frontiers and to afford material military assistance to the combined efforts against the Suviet troops0   Generally spewing the plan of campaign would comprise an offensive-defensive on the Northern &amp;  astern fronts, the main offensive efforts being made by j oltciiak&apos;s Army from the Urals and by Denekinrs forces from the region of the Black ueao An estimate of the numbers availao,le for the various fronts is being prepared and will be forwarded shortly.&quot;1 Staff,r Oil ic e, o * f; * 1.lath February, 1919.
