p /-1;v ofKSSraiCTIOHJON IMPORTS.Note &quot;by the President of the Bogrd of grade. I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet a copy of a letter which I have received from the Federation of British Industries regarding the question of restrictions on imports.A.H.STANLEY.Board of Trade,19th February, 1919.
JOTSBATIQN OF BRITISH&apos;IHDU3!ISIJ S.39, St. Jamesf3 Street, London) S.!v.l.17th February, 1919.Our Ref: 138/305/E/d.Sir,We understand that the policy to be adopted in regard to the continuation of restrictions on Imports i3 receiving the consideration of the War Cabinet.  The Federation desires to nreS3 most strongly on the Government the absolute neces-sity of not allowing products which compete with those of any Industry in this country to bo imported and sold at prices with which existing conditions malm it impossible for the home Industry to compete, until that Industry haa had a reason-able opportunity of converting from a war to a peace footing.-Unless this course is adopted the resumption of normal Indus-trial activity in this country will be gravely prejudiced, aid the effect upon employment must be most serious in the present condition of industrial unrest.The Federation realises that pressure may be being brought . to bear upon the British Government by Foroign Governments who desire to imwt into this country, but such considera-tions appear to &quot;them to be infinitely lass important than those to which reference has been made above.In any case the/would urga that no relaxation of im-port restrictions should be made in deference to the reprosen-tations of a foreign Government without securing from that Government a substantial quid pro quo, and that in any such case the relative value of the concession which is being made to tiie Foreign Government acd of the benefit to bo received in return should be most carefully weighed.Finally, I am to urge that no decision should be taken on this most important question without the fullest consulta-tion with representatives of the industry of to country,and to say that we shall be most willing to place our organisa-tion at the service of the Government to advise them, should they so desire.   I am to point out further that the decision of the questions which arise in connection with this raising of restrictions and granting of licences often involves very minute inquiries into the available and potential supplies of small articles.   These inouiries can most satisfactoruly be made through an organisation such as ours, which comprises manufacturers in every branch of industry and has collected very full statistics as to the products of the various indus-tries;  and we have already been able to render considerable assistance to the Government in dealing with Questions of this kind, referred to us by the Department of  Import Restrictions.President, a?d of Trade,Whitehall Gardens,
