Eaw Materials: 1. With  reference to  Minute 3 of the 1st Meeting, theGovernment Stocks.   Chairman invited Lord Inverforth, who had not been present at themeeting, to make any observations he might wish to submit for theconsideration of the Conference.Lord Inverforth said he had had an opportunity of considering the decision which had been arrived at by the Conference on the previous day, and he announced that he was in agreement with the general policy involved in that decision.Mr. Larke said that the stock of lead, which was held amounted to a year&apos;s supply, and not three years, as he had stated from memory at the previous meeting.Sir Cecil Budd explained the policy of the Ministry of Supply in dealing with these stocks. He said that the Ministry followed the world&apos;s prices (which in some cases were already below the cost of production), not selling too early, but rather waiting for tra*ie to revive, as the effect of reducing the price too low would be that merchants would buy the material rather than the manufacturers. Another danger was that there was a prospect of large consumption, and by forcing down prices a lot of production would, in his opinion, be stopped. He pointed out that one of the difficulties that the Ministry had to face was that the Americans were cutting our prices. He thought that the question of price was a subsidiary cause of the present state of trade stagnation and unemployment.Mr. Montagu said that he did not see why manufacturers would be induced to refrain from buying if prices were forced down, as if ultimately the bottom price should be reached their position would then be sound in that their anxieties about falling prices would disappear.Sir Vincent Caillard thought that the decision arrived at at the previous meeting was a good one, though it would have to be accompanied by other measures to secure the objects for which the Conference was sitting. He pointed out that the manufacturers were afraid of a fall in prices after they had bought.Mr. Arthur Pease stated the Admiralty held no stocks, except of timber which was being disposed of.The Chairman pointed out in regard to the Americans cutting our prices, that if we lowered them the Americans would continue to cut, and a good indication would be obtained, when they ceased cutting the prices, of what the correct level was.It was agreed that (i.) The general policy to be followed by the Departments which hold or control stocks of raw material is : (a.) To endeavour to force down the price of each raw material to a level not higher than the anticipated normal post-war price of the material.(6.) As a safeguard while prices fall to retain sufficient reserve of each material to enable the Government to defeat any attempt at a hold up by merchants.(c.) In the case of any commodity, the price of which falls to a level below the anticipated post-war price, as the stock in hand dwindles, to raise the price gradually from the point to which it has been forced to the level of a fair post-war price.(d.) Where agreements permit, Departments dis-. posing of stocks of raw material to discrimination -nate, if possible, in favour of British users. The amount and nature of the discrimina-tion to be determined by Ministers respon-sible.
Restrictions on Exports.Restrictions on Imports.(ii.) If in any case the general policy cannot be closely adopted because of conditions attaching to the holding or dis-posal of stocks, the underlying intention to provide British industry with cheap raw material should be accepted as the guide in all Departmental action, was decided that the policy outlined above should be forthwith carried into effect.It2. With reference to Minute 3 of the 1st Meeting, Mr. Cecil Harmsworth stated that he thought that it would not be possible to carry into effect any alterations that might be recommended by the Sub-Committee without consulting the Inter-Allied Blockade&apos; Committee.The Chairman pointed out that only British trade interests were being considered by the Sub-Committee, and that it did not appear that the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee would be con-cerned in the matter. If they were, however, they would be considered, but, in any case, Mr. Harmsworth would have the oppor-tunity of considering the recommendations of the Sub-Committee when they were submitted to the Conference.3. The Chairman said that this was a matter which required very careful consideration, and he requested Professor Chapman to explain the present position.Mr. Chapman explained that there were three factors to be considered : (1.) Restriction on imports into this country.(2.) Restrictions placed on exports from foreign countries.(3.) Financial considerations.The shipping position was easier, and goods were coming more freely into the country, but the reasons why restrictions on imports had not been removed were that, while the imports subject to restrictions had begun to increase in quantity, some manufacturers complained because they were unable to keep up their production, and others who had started to produce during the war, and also new industries, complained because they were prejudiced by the increase in imports, Mr. Chapman said that the Board of Trade had proposed to the War Cabinet that they should go slowly in the relaxation of import restrictions, and, if necessaty, to put on other restrictions, particularly in the case of articles the manufacture of which had become a new industry in this country, and the Board thought that many of the complaints which had been made were justified.The Chairman pointed out that the Dominions, and in particular Canada, were complaining of discrimination in regard to import restrictions. He understood that the amount which could be imported was definitely fixed by the Imports Restriction Department, and that that amount was apportioned out to the importers.Mr. Chamberlain stated that Canada&apos;s view was that the basis which the Board of Trade worked on was disadvantageous to her, partly owing to her development of new industries and partly owing to the year chosen as the basis being one in which Canada was at war and her chief competitor was still at peace.Mr. Chapman pointed out that there might have been dis-crimination against Canada owing to questions arising out of the rates of exchange. He said that, as a matter of fact, recommenda-&apos; tions were before the Board of Trade for modifying the basis in certain cases in regard to Canada, and he did not think there would be any difficulty in doing this.Mr.Betterton thought that the basis ought be taken onapre-war year, as things were not normal in 1916, which was the year taken as the basis.
The Chairman, speaking generally on the subject, pointed out that the question of restrictions on imports had a very great bearing on the export trade of the country.Mr. Chamberlain said that the problem was to find goods for the outward journeys and not for the inward journeys, and he understood that while inward-bound ships were carrying to their full capacity, the outward-bound ships were not. The inward-bound ships were carrying raw material and food, and relaxing restrictions in imports would not assist in the payment for these articles, which must be met by reviving the export trade.Mr. Vernet spoke in regard to the paper trade. He quoted figures showing that the import of paper had gradually diminished since control had been imposed, and that the imports for the last year were 400,000 tons (or 550,000 tons, allowing for the fact that it was dry fibre), as against 1,800,000 tons immediately prior to the war. He said that there was a large demand for more paper, and the question arose as to whether restrictions on imports should betaken off. The newspaper proprietors desired this, and said that they had been neglected to the benefit of the mills. He thought that if the restrictions were removed certain mills would be put out of business. In answer to an enqniry by the Chairman, he agreed that half the mills were not properly equipped, and he was sure that these mills would not be able to make any profit if the restrictions were removed, and that even the properly equipped mills would have difficulty in doing so. Mr. Vernet mentioned that there were two considerations to be considered: one was that the foreign exchanges were against us, and the other was how much money should be permitted to go out of the country.The Chairman said that he understood the price of cigarettes had been put up because of the rise in the price of cardboard boxes, and that there was unemployment in the cardboard box trade, and it appeared that the price had gone up on account of the lack of raw materials.Mr. Vernet said he had no knowledge of this, and that the price of boxes had fallen since the armistice, but he thought that the reason for this state of affairs was probably stagnation in other trades.The Chairman said that in regard to the paper trade, it appeared desirable to remove the restrictions on the import of pulp and paper as soon as possible.Mr. Chapman said he was in favour of doing away with the restrictions on the import of pulp, subject to the Treasury view.Mr. Vernet was of opinion that the paper control could not end in sixty days, in which time the mills would have the chance of preparing to compete with other countries, but he thought that, if it were announced that control would be removed a month hence, the effect would be that manufacturers would cancel their contracts. He pointed out that the Scandinavian exporters were trying to capture the British market for paper, and that the price of pulp had been raised two or three times. He mentioned that there were 500,000 tons of pulp available in Canada for export, and he thought it was desirable to allow a large increase in the import of pulp to this country.Mr. Chamberlain said that, from the Treasury point of view, it would be desirable to limit the imports from Sweden especially on account of the rate of exchange, and also on account of the fact that thej- had put up their prices, and he therefore suggested that the imports from Sweden should be decreased, and that the import of pulp from Canada should be encouraged as much as possible. It was, of course, a matter that would require consultation with the foreign Office, and he thought that it would perhaps be better not
to make any public announcement on the subject if it were decided to carry out this suggestion, but that it should be as far as possible arranged with the trade.Mr. Vernet said that he was entirely in favour of this suggestion.It was agreed that Mr. Bridgeman should consider Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s suggestion in regard to limiting the import of pulp from Scandinavia with the Foreign Office, in the light of the discussion that had taken place, so that the Board of Trade might be able to come to a decision at an early date.Sir A. King then reverted to the general question of removing restrictions on imports, and pointed out that in his view there were two dangers in continuing the restrictions. One was that the prices would be kept up as against the consumers, and the other was, that if we shut out other countries they might retaliate in the same way, which would have a disastrous effect on our export trade. He thought that what was required was a definite announcement that import restrictions would cease at a certain date, and that this announcement would greatly assist industry.Sir Vincent Caillard said he felt sure that manufacturers were not yet ready to deal with the situation that would arise if restric-tions on imports were removed, and if such an announcemeut were made, the date named being, say, the 1st June, the effect would be that they would cut down their programmes, unless it were clearly stated that the date was named subject to reconsideration.Mr. Chamberlain was not sure that the effect of such an announce-ment would be desirable.It was agreed that Mr. Bridgeman should discuss the whole subject with Sir Albert Stanley as soon as possible in the general sense of the discussion that had taken place, with a view to Sir Albert consulting Lord Emmott, &quot;and subsequently having a meeting with the Ministers concerned, when a definite decision could be arrived at.Passports and 4. The Chairman then proceeded to deal with the question ofPermits. passports. He stated that he had heard from many sources that, at thepresent time, considerable difficulty was being experienced in the obtaining of passports by those men who wanted very urgently to proceed overseas in order to represent, or to stimulate, British interests in other countries, and he asked Mr. Martin of the Passport Branch of the Foreign Office, to tell the Conference what the position was.Mr. Martin stated that special priority was given by his branch to men such as commercial travellers, especially if their application were supported by the appropriate Chamber of Commerce, or trade organisation. He said, however, that, in his opinion, the delay was due rather to the (perhaps unavoidable) restrictions on shipping. If any delay did occur at the Passport Office at the present time, it was due to the great increase in the number of applications recently received, which had placed very great stress upon the accommoda-tion and staff at the disposal of his branch. The number of applications received daily at the present time was, approximately, 1,200, which was three times the number received a few months ago. He added that since the armistice the greater number of the restrictions which had formerly been in operation had been removed, as it was not now considered necessary to exercise the same rigidity of control over the issue of passports. In reply to an enquiry from the Chairman, Mr. Martin said that an applicant should receive his[1205]-192 C
passport in twenty-four hours, but that delay occurred in a * very large number of cases because applications were made without photographs being submitted in the. first instance, or all&quot; the necessary particulars and recommendations being produced. As regards the steps which had been taken to make the require-ments of the Passport Office generally known to the public, he stated that hanks, Chambers of Commerce, and similar bodies were in possession of the necessary information. He expressed doubt as to the Value of a publicity campaign in the press, in view of the general failure of the public to read its newspapers carefully. Pie drew attention to an important concession which had just been made by his branch, namely, that, when once an applicant has obtained a passport to proceed from this country to another country, he could make further successive journeys to that same country for a period of two years (i.e., the period of the validity of the passport) without making any further application to the passport office.Mr. Chamberlain enquired whether passports were now necessary in every case. &apos;Mr. Martin replied that passports were still required by all persons embarking from the United Kingdom except in the case of demobilised soldiers and their dependants returning to their homes overseas, for whom special arrangements had been made. He added that, apart from embarkation requirements, passports would in any case still be required in cases where the applicant proposed to come back to this country. In the great majority of cases a passport was necessary for the additional reason that a man could not enter the foreign country concerned without one.Mr. Chamberlain suggested the desirability of circularising Chambers of Commerce and commercial editors of newspapers, asking them to give the method of obtaining passports the greatest publicity to all concerned.Mr. Montagu thought that the time had now come when some change might be made in the regulations.Mr. Martin said that this could not be done until other countries brought their procedure into line by withdrawing some of their existing regulations.The Chairman said he would like to know what the present regulations were as regards the issue of permits.Mr. Martin stated that the Home Office were withdrawing their permit system in respect of neutral countries with effect from the 28th of this month, but he added, as regards military zones, that he understood the military authorities considered it necessary to maintain the permit system until peace was signed. He then made the suggestion that the issue of passports could be considerably expedited by instituting a number- of branch passport offices throughout the country. At present it was necessary for a man in the north of Scotland who wanted a passport to apply either in person or by letter to London, which necessarily entailed a certain amount of delay.Mr. Manville suggested that the Chambers of Commerce might afford great assistance in this respect.It was agreed that Mr. Pease, Mr. Manville, Mr. Martin, and Captain Hotham should form themselves into a sub-committee to investigate the whole machinery for the issue of passports and permits, and to make suggestions with a view to facilitating the procedure in future.
Arrangements for 5,   Jn response to a request from the Chairman, Sir Percy Bates^ra^versea^r0Ceed&quot; ProceecIed to outlme tne whole question (from the point of view of ing  verseas. the Ministry of Shipping) of providing facilities for travellers toproceed overseas. He stated that where the stream of individuals proceeding overseas for trade purposes coincided with that of demobilisation and repatriation, there was necessarily considerable difficulty owing to lack of accommodation on the ships available. He added that shipping companies had been requested to give preference to commercial travellers in allotting accommodation, but he feared that any system of reserving accommodation not required for demobilisation purposes would be inconsistent with the terms of the agreement which had been entered into with the various shipping lines. He was not aware that arrangements had been made for the repatriation of men who had come voluntarily to this country during the war for the purpose of enlistment, though he knew Govern-ment munition workers were provided for. he stated that on theNorth Atlantic route there were some 4,000 first and second-class berths available over and above those already required for demobilisation during the month of March ; that in the case of India, 50 per cent, of the accommodation was reserved for demobilisation purposes; and that with regard to the routes to South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, there was very great congestion, and it was practically impossible for a private individual to obtain a berth unless a Government Department obtained it on his behalf. He considered that no real improvement on any of these three routes could be achieved unless the Ministry of Shipping were authorised to make arrangements which would slow down the rate of demobilisation.The Chairman remarked that the number of cases which the Conference had in mind could form only a very small proportion of the total shipping accommodation which was available for all purposes.Captain Hotham observed that the anticipated release of German liners would considerably relieve the situation; but that for the moment some difficulty was being experienced in making the Germans hand over the ships required of them. The Germans were holding back the first batch of fifty-three German ships (of which only a small proportion would be passenger steamers) in the hope of obtaining a decision first on financial questions; but considerable pressure was about to be placed upon the Germans to prevent their - causing delay. He added that the passenger liners to be handed over by the Germans were to be distributed equally between the United States of America and this country.Sir Percy Bates pointed out that a considerable proportion of British shipping was at present being employed in the repatriation of American troops.After further discussion it was agreed that Sir. Arthur Steel Maitland, Lord Inverforth, Sir Percy Bates, and Mr. Foley (Ministry of Shipping) should form thero-selves into a sub-committee to investigate the arrangements that could he made for accommodating in the available shipping commercial travellers and those who had come to this country voluntarily to enlist and were waiting to be repatriated, and to report to the Conference as soon as possible.(Initialled)        A.
