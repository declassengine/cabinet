(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) S E C RET .l   &apos;- WAR CABINET.G. T. 68891 &apos;     I   I1 p - OFFICE ACCOMMODATION.r ^ercorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.(V/ith, reference to Lord Ernie &apos;;s Memorandum G. T. 6864) .Armament Buildings is in the occupation cf the Ministry of Munitions, whose staff have not yet sufficiently contracted to enable either Armament Buildings or the Hotel Metropole or many of the other premises occupied by the Ministry ts be given up.2.     Since December 4th the greatest possible pressure has been brought to bear by the V/ar Cabinet Committee on Accommodation, and even by the V-ar Cabinet itself on the various lisar Departments with a view to releasing buildings in temporary occupation by War staffs.3.     The War Cabinet&apos;s instruction was that the Hotels Victoria, Grand and Cecil should be given up as soon as possible.   The Victoria has been given up, and the Cecil will be released shortly, but no definite date can yet be stated for the restoration of the Grand Hotel, though it is hoped that this will be vacated before very long,4.     The- Vj&amp;p Cabinet Committee on Accommodation can exercise no control over the personnel of Departments,.nor can they adjudicate as between the comparative importance of the work of pre-war Departments in competition for the same building.   This power can be exercised only by the War Cabinet.-5.&apos;    The &apos; ar Cabinet Committee .on accommodation cannot therefore decide whether&apos; the work of the Board of Agriculture or of the &apos;rinistry of Munitions (&quot;inistry of Supply) is the more important in connection with the occupation of Armament Buildings.6.     It should be stated that there is no building available in the Whitehall and Westminster areas in which the staff of the Board of Agriculture can bo concentrated.7.     In regard to the last paragraph of Lord Ernie&apos;s  &quot;emo-randum, (G.T.6864) I would like to state that in view of the number of new Government Departments created and the difficulties as to where and how to accommodate them,- and the uncertainty as to the numbers of their permanent staffs, I think it is inadvisable to come to any decision at the present moment on the subject.   I am. preparing If   ^Jls^QV^n^r^on the whole question of accommodation as far as is I    possible, and it appears 10 me tnat&quot;the question will have to be looked at as a whole scheme of accommodation for all Departments.(Sd.)    ALFRED fiOND,Hi!.-&apos;,Office of Works. 25/2/19.,
