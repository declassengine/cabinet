(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AIT HI C MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) ./jA.SECRET:VJVAR CAB I JOT .GAT^ 68C9:I&quot;MINISTRY CP WAYS AND COMMUNICATIONS* (No.te^by^Gcnerai seely*)With reference to the Draft Bill to establish a Ministry of Ways and Communications, I recommend that clause 2,  (l) (i), assigning tc the Ministry of Ways and Communications &quot;the conveyance of passengers and goods by air&quot; should be deleted for the following reasons(1)    It seems almost self-evident that as all sea-going traffic is controlled by the Admiralty,  so all air-going traffic must be regulated by the Air Ministry, and that the allocation of part of this work to another Ministry must inevitably lead to duplication and contradiction.   This priri-ciple was accepted by the Home secretary and president of the Board of Trade at the instance of Lord TSeir last summer.(2)   The Air Ministry has already taken various steps to assure the necessary control- of civil aerial traffic,  e..g-notice has actually been given of a Bill enabling the Ministry to issue Regulations- on the subject and stating that &quot;the purpose of the Air council should include all matters con-t nected with Aerial Navigation.&quot;I submit,  therefore, that &quot;the conveyance of goods and passengers by air&quot; ought to continue to be dealt with by the Air Ministry, and not to be transferred to the Ministry of Wavs and Communications.(Sgdc)    J.E.3. SEELY.Air Mini3try,Strand, W.C, 2.14th February, 1919
