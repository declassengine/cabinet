Christie-Miller, Coldstream Guards, and E. B. TrafFord, Scots Guards.Before starting our report we wish to state that we spent 40 months in captivity in Germany, the last and worst nine of which were spent in the X Hannover Army Corps District. This Army Corps, under General von Haenisch, was notorious for its ill-treatment of British prisoners of war, both officers and men.We have during the three bitter years undergone indignities and humiliation at different times, such as being spat upon by German officers, and being compelled to perform menial tasks in the presence of German non-commissioned officers and men. Therefore, in making the following report, it cannot be suggested that we were in any way favourably inclined towards the German people, or to Hannover in particular, which stinks in the nostrils of all ex-British prisoners of war.We would next like to state that we were most carefully instructed in our duties before leaving The Hague by the Military Attache, Lieut.-Colonel L. Oppenheim, C.M.G. The line of action he devised for us would have have been even more effective if our official instructions, handed to us by the Armistice Commission at Spa, had contained a paragraph to the effect that we were to ask for and check official figures as to demobili-zation, military stores, &amp;c.In our opinion, which has been confirmed by the experience gained during our researches, the German authorities would tell one anything provided it is asked for in the proper way by accredited missions.NARRATIVE.1. We left Cologne by the Armistice Express at about 1.30 a.m. on the 2nd February, 1919, and travelling via Cassel (10.30 a.m.), Gottingen-Kreiensen (12.30 p.m.), changed here,&apos;and thence by slow train to Hannover, which was reached at 3 p.m.No troops of any sort were seen in stations or sidings between Harburg-Cassel, Oassel--Hannover. Our arrival at Hannover was not expected, and after reporting at the Bahnof Cornmandantur, the Feldwebel in charge telephoned to the General Kommando, who gave instructions that we were to be quartered in an hotel, whither we were conducted by an Unteroffizier. We were installed in the Ernst August Hotel, opposite the station, formerly known as the Hotel Bristol. The Bahnof Commandant informed us that it was no use reporting to the General Kommando, as, it being Sunday afternoon, we should find no one.2 On Monday, the 3rd February, at about 10 a.m., we were informed on the telephone, by some English-speaking individual, that we were to be fetched and conducted to the General Kommando, X Army Corps.This individual shortly arrived, dressed in civilian clothes, fur coat, &amp;c., and introduced himself to us as Dr. Pohlmann, and said he had been detailed to attend us.3. We had never seen this individual before, but had often heard from British non-commissioned officers and men we had met in Flolland that in the Gefangenen Lagers of Hamelin and Celle a certain Dr. Pohlmann had been employed in plain clothes to ingratiate himself with prisoners of war and get information of all sorts. We were aware that much information about Dr. Pohlmann had been collected by the British authorities in Holland, and subsequent conversations convinced us this man and our guide were identical. We managed to get his photograph as a souvenir which may be of. use in marking him down. He told us he had been in Plymouth on 3rd August, 1914, and used to stay with English friends at Grimsby. Also that he often been on missions to the West Front and Brussels.   From other sources we learnt that he was(B19/U4)   60  2/19   H&amp;S   6881-two
employed on the General Kommando X Army Corps, but that on the day of the revolution had failed to put in an appearance.This knowledge put us very much on our guard with him.4. On reaching the General Kommando we were introduced to the Chief of the Staff of X Army Corps, Major Weniger, to whom we showed our credentials and our instructions. He was very quiet and polite, and told us that every facility would be given us to carry out our researches. After discussing the method of procedure, it was decided to divide our work into two headings (a) Military and (b) Civil. We were then taken to the buildings of the Intendantur, where we were received by Gehoimrat General Intendant Rachner, to whom we stated our case in the presence of andthree Abteilung Chefs.We were promised all returns as to scale of military rations, &amp;c., which they said we might test in any way by visiting any barracks, storehouses or clothing stores we liked, either with or without notice.5. After this interview we were conducted to the Rathaus, where we were received by the Oherburgermeister Leinart, Biirgermeister Dr. Weber, the Food Controller, Director Jeep, and the Statistics Secretary, Dr. Seutermann. The same procedure followed, and the Oberburgermeister, addressing us, spoke most feelingly about the food shortage in Hannover, especially as regards the scarcity of milk for children and sick people, which was owing to killing milk cows and cows in calf owing to shortage of fodder and of meat.He laid particular stress on the shortage of fats.Potatoes were short owing to their not having been properly harvested when the prisoners of war went home and also to the lack of labour. He stated that two-thirds of the people of Hannover had got their full allowance of potatoes in their cellars up to June, 1919, but the remaining one-third had none at all. It was now necessary to collect 2 lb. a week from those who had their full ration in order to make up the deficit, but this collection was found most difficult for various obvious reasons.We pointed out respectfully that the whole world was short of food and that naturally our Governments first duty was towards her Allies, such as Belgium and Serbia, which had been swept bare.6. On the 4th February we visited the town market at 9 a.m., which we had also seen the previous afternoon. It was almost as bare as on our first visit. Of the 500 stalls, which are all leased by the town in peace time, only 10 per cent, are let now. We saw a very long queue waiting at a stall for skimmed milk.After this we had a very long and exhausting morning in the Rathaus, where the whole card system and ration scale was explained most carefully to us. The different cards were all given to us and will be handed over to the Food Controllers Department. Very little leakage appeared to be possible. Comparative scales of rations are attached. The points which appeared to want comment were  i(a.) Nearly every recommendation by medical men for extra rations or milk- for sick patients was very greatly reduced by the Town Medical Board,&apos; and in the cases of incurable diseases extra rations were always refused.(b.) Tuberculous cattle were used for food, and we were informed that after the affected parts had been removed the meat was quite harmless.(c.) As regards horse rations, we were told that, although the allowance was 1^ lb. of oats and 3 lb. of hay per diem, there had been no distribution of hay since the 20th January. The horses, however, got 5 lb. a day of some Ersatz fodder consisting of molasses and turnips, but we were told that the horses would not eat it.As regards the milk supply, in peace time the town of Hannover consumed 140,000 litres of milk per diem. To keep up the present scale of rations 30,000 litres per diem was required, but in [joint of fact they only received 24,000 litres? The Milk Controller estimated that the situation might improve in March, buttht-, Food Controller challenged this, as he said great inroads were being made into the stock of milk cows through so many being killed to increase the food ration.7. On the 5th February we visited a sausage factory which was the most disgusting thing we have ever seen. The sausages were made from every imaginable remnant of the animal, including the lungs, the stomach lining, the veins, the skin from the head and legs, which in England would be impossible for human consumption.Thence to the town slaughter house, which was even more disgusting. The cattle that were being slaughtered were, in our opinion, much under size, including two cows in calf which we were assured was very common now owing to the meat shortage.   We
carefully inspected the carcases and found them almost devoid of fat. The shed in which&apos;formally 5,000 pigs per week were slaughtered was absolutely empty, and we were told that only 500 pigs a year were killed. In an upper floor we saw a store of salted horse Mesh, and we were told that these barrels contained the salted meat of 250 horses which was being kept as an emergency ration.We then motored to the Hanomag or Hannoversche Maschinenbau-Aktien-Gesellschaft, which is situated in Linden. We were received by the director, Herr Gustav Ter Meer, who was extremely frigid, and questioned our right to visit his establishment. We explained that the food question, especially as it affected the workmen, was giving concern to our Government. He informed us that he employed 5,000 workmen now against 8,000 when the Armistice was declared, and that owing to the great shortage of coal it was only possible to work one shift of eight hours. For the same reason, during the week 12th-18th February, his works were only open for four days, and during the current week there would be no work on two days. He informed us that in peace time he manufactured from 400 to 500 railway locomotives per annum. Now he cannot make more than 15 per month, and during January, 1919, only 12. His chief difficulty was lack of coal and discontent on the part of the workmen owing to their physical weakness through want of food. There was an under-current of Bolshevism which had not yet come to the surface. Wages had risen 50 per cent. He assured us that excellent relations existed between himself and his men, which was borne out when a deputation from all the shops was introduced to us. Having been told our mission, they were invited to state their views. They spoke with extreme bitterness of the hardship and danger of continuing the blockade. They declared that the President of the United States in his speeches, which had been thrown down over the German trenches, had stated that as soon as hostilities ceased and they had got rid of their ruling house they would get food. Now the prospect seemed further off than ever. They stated most forcibly : &quot; Do away with the blockade and let our ships fetch food.&quot; We asked them if they implied that England had broken faith with them on this matter, and they replied in the affirmative. We requested them to formulate this exact charge in writing, supported by (a) Press cuttings showing Mr. Wilson&apos;s promises; (b) a copy of the Flieger Blatt, They acknowledged twice that this charge against the Allies referred, only to the breach of faith in not raising the blockade. Their statement, which is signed, will be found and marked among the Appendices.We then visited the engine works and saw some very fine locomotives under construction. The workmen were mostly in uniform. In one yard we saw two British tanks, one bearing the number 2679, and also two German tanks ; the latter had been constructed in these works.We feel that we ought to comment on the extremely bitter attitude of the director, Herr Ter Meer.In the afternoon we visited the Continental Tyre Company, which is said to be the biggest business in Hannover.We were received by the director, Siegemund Seligmann (Geheimer Kommer-zienrat), and Wily Tischbein, the second in command. They stated that they &quot;employed 12,000 men before the war, 5,000 at the time of the Armistice and 4,000 men now. Most of these have no work to do, but they must keep them on. The principal trouble is lack of rubber and cotton, and also the shortage of food. About 3 weeks before a wave of Bolshevism appeared. As regards their business it was very difficult to divide the two questions, i.e., raw material and food, as both hiing so closely together. Excellent relations existed between the directors and the men. A deputation of three workmen entered and stated their case. They told the same story, namely, &quot;Take off the blockade.&quot; Fats and bread were most urgently needed, and they feared trouble if none came in 4 weeks&apos; time. In fact the food situation was most serious. They expressed the greatest astonishment that their fishing fleet was not allowed out. This deputation was extremely earnest and respectful.We then visited some parts of the huge factory and saw Ersatz motor tyres being made out of a sort of cloth and Ersatz rubber. The workmen were mostly in uniform. Herr Tischbein told us that the men who gave most Bolshevist trouble were army cripples, of whom they had to employ 2 per cent. He also told us that he used to be attached to the German Great Headquarters at Spa.After this we visited Appels&apos; Conserve Fabrik, the German Crosse and Blackwelfs. They had 300 employees before the war and now only 110. Wages had risen 120 per cent, since the war started and at this moment they had 40 commercial travellers drawing full salary and doing no work. We inspected this factory, which was nearly empty.    Most of the goods were Ersatz productions.    The great speciality of this(6881) A 2
factory was tinned herrings, but as fishing was no longer possible in the North Sea the mountains of empty tins in the warehouse were useless. The head of the firm, Herr Appel, interviewed us and told us that the most pressing necessities for the general population at this moment were fat, bacon, peas and beans, flour and fish, but for his factory fish and oil were essential. The same story again, &quot; Take the blockade off!&quot; He informed us that he had business relations with Messrs. Simpson, Roberts and Co., of Stanley Street, Liverpool, which he hoped to renew shortly. He bought much fish in England and Scotland.Having concluded our visit to this establishment, we ordered our chauffeur, much to the annoyance of Dr. Pohlmann, to drive to the largest wholesale boot shop that he knew of. Therefore no notice could possibly be given to prepare anything for us. We found very few boots, which were extremely bad. There were only 3,000 pairs of leather boots, costing 31 marks, which had been manufactured for the coal miners and were only available for issue to the mine owners in small quantities. The remaining boots had wooden soles, inferior leather sides and paper tops. Paper slippers were shown us which cost four marks a pair.On our way back we passed two almost new British tanks, one of which bore the number 2692.8. The 6th February was devoted entirely to visiting military establishments. On this occasion we were joined for the first time by a Dr. Lindemann, whom we were told was the representative of the Arbeiter und Soldatenrat. The General Intendant Rachner and staff met us and took us first of all to the garrison lazaret, which contained 280 patients, though it held 310. There were 12 lazarets in Hannover, containing altogether 850 patients. The scale of rations in the lazaret will be found in the Appendices. After visiting the kitchens, we were taken into a single ward, containing one patient, who was indescribably dirty and whose nightshirt was tilthy. He informed us that he was a German officer. Also we saw the operating theatre, which was almost dirtier; paper bandages, &amp;c.Thence to the Waterloo Barracks, occupied by the Infantry Regiment 73 (&quot; Gibraltar &quot;). Although we were informed that these were old barracks, it would be impossible to describe their dilapidation and filth. The majority of the windows were broken and bits of sacking, boards, &amp;c, placed over the holes. We were taken straight to the kitchen, where the under officer explained that he cooked for three companies of I.R. 73. The big boiler, which was full, was said to contain 600 litres of soup, the ration for 600 men. We inspected the diet sheet and wrote down in our note-books the strength of these three companies, as follows : 3rd February...... ...... 6284th February ...      ... ...      ... 6435th February ...      ... ...      ... 7196th February ...      ... ...      ... 678We were informed that there were now three meatless days a week. The demeanour of the soldiers of this regiment in barracks was extremely bad. They appeared dirty, untidy and took absolutely no notice of the officers who accompanied us.As they were trying to get us away from these barracks without giving us any opportunity of getting figures, &amp;c, we insisted that we should be taken to the regimental headquarters to see the Commander. The block in which he lived was on the other side of the Waterloo Platz, and was, if anything, more dilapidated than the first. We were introduced to the regimental commander, who was Oberleutnant (Lieutenant) Ketler. We tried to get at his numbers through discussing the number of loafers we had seen about the barracks drawing rations and doing nothing. He showed us his parade strength for one moment and promised us a copy which was never forthcoming. He told us that the strength of the first and third battalions of his regiment was 1,730; 200 more men were on command and the second battalion of I.);. 73 was at Soltau guarding the Russian prisoners. We did not tell him we had copied down the figures in the cookhouse, but asked for the strength of the three companies quartered in that block, which he gave as 700 men.Dr. Lindemann, of the Soldatenrat, now raised his voice for the first time and told us that the Soldatenrat would not allow soldiers to be discharged without a job, and that this order dated from the 10th January and would last at least five months. Oberleutnant Ketler told us that all men who were due for demobilization had been demobilized. We challenged his figures, and he said that the strength of his regiment in war, including its Ersatz formations, field recruiting depots, &amp;c, was between 10,000 and 12,000 men, but that now the Ersatz battalion had been disbanded.
Dr. Lindemann also told Captain Trafford that besides the Hannover Garrison a military force of between 1,000 and 2,000 men was in the town under orders of the Arbeiter und Soldatenrat, and that many of these men lived at home with their families. Also that there were 80 Freiwillige in the barracks of I.It. 73, and that 50 of these had that day left for the East.Thence we motored to the barracks of Field Artillery Regiment No. 10, which had much better quarters and very much better discipline. The officers were always saluted by their men, who appeared to be very young. We were taken to the orderly room, where the regimental commander, a major whose name we never got, told us that he had in his command the first Abteilung and one battery, strength 650 men. He told us that every battery now had 75 horses; formerly an Abteilung had 300 horses. He had 25 men per battery staying on by the orders of the Arbeiter und Soldatenrat ^vho ought to have been demobilized. He then conducted us to the kitchen, where we were shown the big boiler, then full, which was said to contain soup for 800 men. We tasted the soup, horse, beans, &amp;c, and he explained to us that in order that each man should get a fair ration of meat whenever it was issued, they took their soup plate to another boiler and got a small ladle containing meat ration which might otherwise have been unfairly distributed in the large boiler. This major appeared to take trouble for his men&apos;s welfare and they all saluted him most respectfully. He told Captain Trafford that the Soldatenrat were quite well-behaved and never interfered with him. Also that he had one of his batteries in the East and that his regiment were just starting to drill again.We then visited the horses, whose condition was simply awful. In one stable they stood on a form of rush bedding entirely uncared-for and mere skeletons. One often saw alongside a big strapping horse a weedy pony. The second stable we visited was slightly better than the first, as they stood on moss litter, but the condition of the horses was identical.We then visited the Korps Lebensmittelamt, where we saw the same disgusting sausages being prepared, and were taken all over their food store. The store cellars were nearly empty. We asked for and were informed that there was no preserved milk at all, but were shown some horrible form of cheese which looked like cart grease. Also some liquorice powder, which they said was formed into a sort of paste and eaten with bread. In November and December many army horses had been killed, but now only two or three a day when the vets certified them as useless. We were handed the garrison diet sheet, which is marked &quot; Sjjieseplan&apos;&apos; and attached with the Appendices.We concluded our tour by, visiting the Kriegs Bekleidungsamt, or clothing establishment, where we were met by Oberst Schmidt, who spoke English, but said he preferred to use German in Germany. He was wearing the new badges of rank and was the first senior officer who I had seen so dressed ; one broad and two narrow blue bands on the fore-arm, plus a metal Roman X on the broad band. We were particularly polite to him and his manner thawed rapidly. He stated that 100,000 civilian suits were being made for discharged soldiers, that 30,000 military uniforms were being made, and that as so much clothing had been lost and stolen during the demobilization no material or cloth was being released for civilian purposes. We pointed out that there must be large stores of clothing of all sorts, boots, blankets, &amp;c, prepared for the field army, which he disputed and invited us to inspect his warehouses. Boots, he told us, were being issued daily to the new Freiwillige Korps. We visited many of his stores and workshops, where much work was going on. A signed statement of the stock in these warehouses is attached. WTe noticed that he had a large supply of gray cloth, and some which had been dyed blue for civilian purposes. One cloth store which contained avast amount of cloth we estimate ac being 80 yards long by 15 yards wide, less a gangway of 2 yards. In this the cloth was piled nearly up to the roof. In the boot store he showed us 10,000 pairs of Ersatz boots (i.e., with paper tops) which he stated were going by Hamburg to the Black Sea for German troops there. This was not understood. Also in another store 6,000 gray fatigue or boiler suits being issued for the railway employees.During the afternoon Rittmeister Max Miiller. of Uhlan Regiment No. 14, called on us to do something for his brother who was a prisoner in South-West Africa. He told us that he was a Royalist and brother of Admiral Yon Muller, Chief of the Kaiser&apos;s Marine Cabinet, and that he was a personal friend of Prince Henry of Prussia. He said that the discipline in the 14th Uhlans was still very good, that the Soldatenrat in Hannover did not interfere with him and had, in fact, asked him to run the demobilization of his regiment.   We asked him how it was he managed to retain his
badges of rank and he replied that if the Soldatenrat tried to take them he would use his stick. In his opinion, ten years would see a constitutional monarchy in Germany like England under the Crown Prince&apos;s son. He knew English people and was a friend of &quot; Lord Haig of the Edinburgh Hussars.&quot;9. On the 7th February we were received by appointment by Major Weniger, Chief of the Staff of the 10th Army Corps, and read him a memorandum which we had drawn up in order to try and get figures as regards the strength of the 10th Army Corps. Our difficulty, as we previously stated, was due to the fact that the Armistice Commission would not insert a paragraph in our instructions in a straightforward manner. A copy of this memorandum is attached and Major Weniger kept the original. We noticed that he wore for the first time the new badges of rank and no shoulder straps. He listened to our memorandum with great attention, and at once showed us a table with the new Order of Battle of the 10th Army Corps, which he proceeded to explain. He stated that all reserve and war units had been disbanded, and only those units now remained which were on the peace establishment plus one Flieger Squadron, one signalling battalion, one motor transport battalion, one anti-aircraft Abteilung, and stated that the reason these were being kept on was that they were new arms formed since 1914. He next showed us the numbers on the strength of all regiments, which were set out in columns so as to show their year classes. Another column showed the number of long service non-commissioned officers who wished to stay on. He promised us copies of these documents. We discussed the surplus numbers, and he said &quot;All classes are to be demobilized except the &apos;99 class. The &apos;98 class will be completely demobilized by the end of February.&quot; The older classes remaining on the strength were required now for police and demobilization purposes. The following numbers he did give us, and Captain Trafford noted them down in his book : -     I.R. 73         ............ 2,700I.R. 74.........      ... 1,400I.R. 77        ............ 950I.R. 78         ............ 600I.R. 79        ............ 1,300He stated that too few men were left for cleaning and guarding barracks, also for guarding stores of the Field Army, which, were left scattered about during the retreat. Many people wanted the &apos;99 class demobilized, as they were so bad, but if this were done no others could be got to replace them, as it would mean taking them away from civilian employment, also because Russian prisoners had to be guarded. The Army could not have done more for demobilization. If demobilization were carried out to extremes tnere would be a great increase of unemployment. The size of the military ration was settled by the Government and was a political matter. Military rations had been reduced. The moral of the troops was extremely bad now, and if food rations were further reduced would become still worse. He informed us that there were half to three-quarters of a million soldiers now in Germany compared to 65 million civilians. Also that the soldiers were young and wanted a lot to eat on account of larger rations in the field and were now working very badly. He suggested we had noticed that there was no saluting of officers, &amp;c. We took this opportunity of telling him how much we as officers resented the slight shown to himself and the Corps of Officers by this disrespect in Hannover and expressed our sympathy with them. He was very pleased with this and became even more cordial. We told him that we were not suggesting a reduction of the military ration, but merely getting figures to support the comparative table of civilian and military rations which our Government were certain to ask us for (see also our Memorandum).The next point we discussed was the food supplies from army stores which we submitted should be released for the civil population. General Intendant Rachner, who was present, made a very long address to the effect that large amounts of food supplies had to be left behind during the retreat owing to lack of transport. He further said that food supplies &quot; had been handed over for the civil population.&quot; We challenged this statement, quoting the Food Director, Herr Jeep, who had told us the previous evening that not one grain had reached his department from the Army.Rachner then said that the General Officer Commanding had given him orders that no further military supplies were to be handed to the civil authorities as all were now to be kept for tie Volunteer Corps in the East. He told us that the Soldatenrat had forced the military to hand over provisions to railwaymen, who were required to prepare locomotives quickly, as these men had refused to work unless given better rations.  We
insisted that there must be clepdts in Germany where stores had been prepared and collected tor the Field Army, but he replied that a lot still remained at the farms.As regards clothing, a great quantity had been stolen at the outbreak of the Revolution. Major Weniger added that every man on discharge had been entitled to a new outfit, and that this was a pity, as there was not sufficient now to supply the troops in the East. We were not satisfied witii these replies, and as Major Weniger intimated that he had other business to do, we arranged a further appointment for the next afternoon, when he promised to give us the Tables of Strength, Order of Battle, &amp;c, signed and stamped by his office.Military Section, British Delegation, 15th February, 1919.
