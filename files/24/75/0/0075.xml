3 E 0 R TjE(I i B I II S 1,AXIS TRAGIC *(Memorandum &quot;by llx-, Ea3parling, ?oroign Offled)His Majesty1 s Government havo lcn6 coon seriously embarrassed by the traffic in arms in the Persian Gulf and the Red Soa.     It was observed that tho dangers of this ti&amp;^fio would bo much inoleased after the war owing to the existence in the hands of tho -helligoronta of large surplus stocks of war material end the creation of now States out of tho debris of the Turkish Empire.    It was accordingly proposed to secure tho signature of as many Powers a?? possible to a convention enforcing-a much stricter control of tho traffic than had been possible in the past.Tho assent of tho French Government was to be secured by preliminary negotiations at Paris because France had formerly been the chief centre of the traffic     fortunately the French Government are, themselves now anxious to restrict the traffic in West ilfri-cs where the natives have shown signs of insubordination and they have now expressed their roadihqgs to begin negotiations at once,.     There is every, reason to believe that tho United States Government will support tho convention because the United States are them-&apos; selves interested in cutting: off supplies of arms from themore turbulent countries of Latin ,miericarIn outline tho convention binds the signatory powers (a) not to dispose of their existing stocks of arms and out of their, control,. ,ad (b) prohibits any future traffic in arms and ammunition or the manufacture or repair&apos;of arms and ammunition in certain specified areas, such as the whole.ammunition in any way which would allew such stocks, to pass
of Africa (with provision to meet the case of Egypt, liorocco etc.) or in any backward countries which may have not accepted a mandatory from the League of Hations.Under (a) it was also provided that any contracts entered into prior to the date of signature and contrary to the provisions of the convention should be annulled. This was inserted to meat the very probable case of large contracts being hurriedly made in Prance to supply arm? to Abyssinia where they are a constant source of trouble to the neighbouring British Possessions;It is now reported from Paris that the Mini * try of Munition? are disposing of British surplus stocks and that contracts have been made or are under negotiation which conflict&apos; with the principle0 of the convention.There i* no specific information in the Foreign Office about the action taken by the Ministry of Munition&quot;.   It appear^ however a? the result of an enquiry received through His Majesty&apos;s Military Attache at Chriatiania that the Ministry has a large amount of &quot;surplus stores&quot; of &quot;great variety&quot; for disposal.   The Directorate of Overseas Trade have aliio sent out a world wide circular offering for ^ale &quot;materials produced in excess for war purposes, including aeroplanes, wooden good--, metal repetition work, sulphuric acid etc.&quot;   It was subsequently ascertained that rifle% field guns and ammunition were not included in thi* category but that field wireleea *et&quot; were *o included,.As regards foreign Powers it i&apos;* known that Chile has been offered rifles and ammunition by Italy and there; i* some reason to believe that Bolivia haa been enquiring for machine guns in Spain.    It is, alao believed that Japan would be ready to sell arms to any South American country.These
These proceedings are highly distasteful to the United States Government which has endeavoured without success to prevent the sale of arms to any Latin American country likely to disturb the peaceThe Questions requiring imediate settlement are (a) should the Convention &quot;be modified to admit cf the sals cf surplus war material to what may &quot;be oallsd hor.a*fide pur-ohasers (b)&apos; &quot;what constitutes fiarms and anitjiunition&quot; within the meaning of the convent!on*It will ho oboewd that the tvro qiU&apos;.ntiono are iirtcr-dopendent and turn largely on the definition of &quot;arms and-ammunition&quot;.   The Convention as drafted was interlace to * cfcopthe -ale of rifles and cartridges in the Persian Gulf and RedS^a, and it is not to he supposed that an aeroplane or atwelve inch gun would be of much us&apos; to an Afridi or anAhynrinian raid- r,   They would however to distinctly useful to Chilo, for instancy and as far an we are -concerned other ^is no r-*ason why Chile should not have them?. &quot;but for theopposition of the United Stat(f. GevezTjnente isit/aug 7:sted that the %nt(-rdepartxaental Gcamitte-&apos;: which inert n at&apos; the  ndia Office on February 24th, should, in default of any other solution draw up two lists (a) of countries to which war material may he sold rcgardl;&apos;r.o of its nature (b) of war material which may safely be cold regardless of the country cf destination.For example, under (a) might fall countries such as Spain or Holland; und&apos;-r (b) surplus material such as appears to be contemplated by the Dirrotorate of Overs/as Trace.(SgcU)    R. SPERLIKG.Foreign Office,22nd February, 1919e
DRAFT CONVENTION FOR THE CONTROL OF THE &apos; , ARMS TRAFFIC. &apos; IM &apos; U^i$biTHE manufacture of arms and ammunition for the purposes of the war, which has now terminated, having led to the accumulation among the belligerents of vast stocks, of which the disposal might prove dangerous, and which should for this reason be placed under control; andThe experience of all nations having demonstrated the evil Consequences resulting from the distribution of arms and ammunition in territories where the inhabitants have not been able to establish for themselves a firm and stable administration ;The High Contracting. Parties, being of opinion that the pro-visions of the Brussels General Act on the subject of the Arms Traffic no longer satisfy the requirements of the situation, have resolved to replace them by stipulations of a m,ore far-reaching character, and applying to a wider area, and have for this purpose agreed as follows : 1. (1.) The High Contracting Parties charge the League of Nations with the duty of watching over the trade in arms and ammunition with the countries specified in article 8 of this Convention.

Articles 8 to 14 of the General Act of Brussels, 1890, are abrogated as from the date of the ratification of the present Convention.3. The High (Contracting Parties agree that they will not sell or otherwise dispose of the stocks of arms and ammunition remaining under their control at the date of the signature of this Convention, in any way which would allow such arms and ammunition to leave the national territory for any purpose other than the use of the High Contracting Party itself. Steps will be taken to, annul any contracts entered -info before the date of the signature of this Convention which conflict with the provisions of this article.4. The High Contracting Parties will prohibit the export, without a licence, of arms and ammunition to all destinations, except in the cases where such arms or ammunition are for the use of the armed forces of the importing Government, and under its control. Where the arms are exported without a licence for the purpose of replacing weapons discarded by the armed Forces, the weapons so discarded must be destroyed when the new weapons are issued to the armed forces.5. The export licence referred to in article 4 will be issued in each case under the authority of the Government. *6. An annual return will be made and published by each of the High Contracting Parties showing the numbers, amount, and destina-tion of the arms, and ammunition for which export licences have been granted under article 5. Copies of this return will be forwarded to the Central Office for the information of the League of Nations.
7. No licences whatever shall be granted for the export of arms and ammunition to any State which, after having been placed under the guarantee of the League of Nations, and after being given the opportunity of applying for the help and guidance of some foreign Power hi&apos;the development of its administration, has failed to apply to any such Power for the purpose.8.

Apart from the Governments own requirements, no arms or ammunition maybe deposited in, or taken out of, the warehouse without previous authority from the administration, which shall not be granted, either for deposit or removal, in the case of arms of precision, such as rifled fire-arms, magazine or breech-loading rifles, or automatic pistols, whether complete or in parts, or their corresponding ammunition.Special exceptions are permissible in the case of arms or ammunition for the individual use of Government officials, bond Jide travellers, and other persons who can establish the necessity for possessing such arms or ammunition; but in all such cases the arms must be registered, and can only be held under special permits granted for a limited period.10. The sale of arms and ammunition in every part of the areas specified in article 8 will be brought under the control of the Government of the State or territory.In each State, Colony, or Protectorate within the specified areas the Governments concerned shall determine annually the quantity of arms and ammunition to be allowed in the said State, Colony, or Protectorate.

In the areas specified in article 8 the Governments con-&apos; cerned will take all such measures as they deem necessary (1) to ensure that as full effect as possible is given to the provisions of this
Convention regarding the import, sale, and transport of arms; and (2) to prevent either the import or export of arms apcl ammunition across their inland frontiers or the passage of such, arms towards districts where their import would be undesirable. Subject to the provisions of article 7, the transit of arms and ammunition through the territory of a signatory or adhering State in occupation of the coast into that of another such State occupying inland territory with no direct access to the sea is permissible, pro-vided that the Head of the importing State certifies that the said arms and ammunition are required for Government purposes, and that they are not destined for sale, and undertakes that they will not be disposed of for private use.13. No vessel of any description whatever may carry arms or ammunition consigned to any port or destination within the areas specified in article 8 without having on board a special licence issued by the Government of the exporting country, stating the quantity, character, &amp;c, of the consignment and the name of the consignee.

With this object an officer in uniform may. be sent on board.the vessel after it has been hailed to give notice of such intention. The officer sent on board the vessel shall act with all possible consideration and moderation.18. If the commander has reason to believe that a native vessel is carrying arms or ammunition in contravention of this Convention, he may proceed to a summary examination of the cargo.19. If, as a result of such examination, it is proved that the vessel is engaged in the illicit conveyance of arms or ammunition, the commander will send the vessel to the nearest port where there is a competent authority of the Power whose flag has been used. Each of the, High Contracting Parties undertakes to appoint authorities competent to act in such cases, and to notify their appointment to the Central Office.The suspected vessel can also be handed over to a warship of its own nation, if the latter consents to take charge of it.20. The authority referred to in the preceding- article to whom the vessel detained has been handed over shall proceed to make a full investigation according to the laws and rules of his country in the presence of an officer belonging to the foreign warship or aircraft.21.
