Fortunately, however, the fire did not reach nore than one portion of the rooms which were assigned as offices for the Section, and consequently most of the important records of the Section have been sayed, while the greater part of those that have been lost in the firo can be rer constructed fron documents which were in the possession of the Seotion&apos;s Inspectors who were engaged on outdoor work.

It has however, to be taken into consideration that the best of the flax was scutched earlier in the season, and that what is now being scutched is cf a poorer quality.Demand fgr Flaxoeedo   Farmers are delaying purchasing seed in the hope that large suppITyf cf Dutch seed (which is still the popular variety) will be available before sowing tine.
