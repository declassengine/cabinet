Raw Materials:Raw Materials Board.1. The Chairman stated that as a result of a Conference of Ministers (G.T.-6835) held under the Presidency of the Prime Minister on the previous day, he had been authorised to examine, with the full authority of the Cabinet, the whole position relating to unemploy-ment and the present state of trade, and to report to the Prime Minister as to the best way of removing the various existing cliffi-culties and obstacles in the way of restarting the machinery of trade. With that object he had summoned the meeting so that it might be ascertained what Government machinery there was avail-able for assisting industry, or, on the other hand, what Government machinery there might be in existence which was inadvertently hindering the re-development of industry.2. The Chairman raised the question as to the position in regard to Raw Materials.Colonel Amery said that the War Cabinet had appointed a Board of Ministers (known as the Raw Materials Board), with the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr. Walter Long,&apos; as Chairman, ex officio, to consider with the Departments directly concerned with the supply during the war of each of the raw materials referred to in the resolutions of the Imperial War Conference, 1918, what action was necessary in order to provide that the necessary supplies should in met be available for the United Kingdom after the war, and to arrange for such administrative action, beyond what had already taken place, as was necessary to secure such supplies. Lord Milner had now assumed the office of Secretary of State for the Colonies, but had not yet had any opportunity of taking up actively the duties of Chairman of the Board; and it was understood that Mr. Long was willing to remain associated with the Board, if desired. The Board of Trade had suggested that, detailed questions relating to the supply of raw materials for the United Kingdom, which did not raise any substantial question of national policy, could now be best dealt with by that Department in direct consultation with any other Department which might be concerned, and a draft memorandum for submission to the War Cabinet had been drawn up in the Board of Trade embodying this suggestion and also recommending that the Raw Materials Board should be continued only as a Committee to determine any large question of policy which might arise, especially in regard to schemes for the development of Imperial resources. In view, however, of Lord Milner&apos;s absence in Paris, no consideration had so far been given to this proposal.The Chairman enquired whether the functions of the Board were co-ordinating or executive.Colonel Amery replied that the terms of reference, which he read in full, showed that the functions of the Board were both co-ordinating and executive. The Board had taken decisions, which had been communicated to the Departments concerned, with instruc-tions to give effect to them.The Chairman raised the question as to the necessity for the Control Raw Materials Board remaining in existence. He pointed out that it originated with the idea of advising on raw materials purely from an Imperialistic point of view, and had for some reason or other taken executive action in regard to raw materials from all points of view. He was of opinion that the Board should be dis-solved immediately, and that all matters in connection with raw material should be dealt with by the Board of Trade, who were willing to deal with them, and who were the proper Department for doing so.Colonel Amery strongly deprecated the dissolution of the Board, and asked that a caveat on behalf of Lord Milner should
Raw Materials: 3. The Chairman then enquired what machinery was used by the(Government Stocks.   Ministry of Munitions in regard to raw materials.Mr. Larke stated that the Ministry of Munitions dealt with ferrous and non-ferrous materials, and that large stocks were held by the Ministry. There was an Interdepartmental Committee of the Ministry known as the &quot; Raw Materials Committee,&quot; dealing with the question, and the ,Ministry of Munitions were in process of liquidating their stocks. The policy of this Raw Materials Committee was to follow the world&apos;s prices, and that if these prices fell the Ministry would accordingly lower the prices of their stocks. This was so that competitors might not get the advantage of cheaper raw materials. Mr. Larke then, in reply to a request from the Chairman went into detail in regard to the stocks of the various articles which the Ministry of Munitions held. He said that the stocks of copper and spelter amounted to about eight months&apos; supply, the stock of brass to approximately three years&apos; supply, and the stock of lead amounted to two and a-half to three years&apos; supply. The Ministry were not holding stocks of tin. Mr. Larke explained that the policy of the Committee was not to break the market, but to follow the world&apos;s prices closely without giving any lead to a fall. They realised that if the bottom price could be found, the ultimate result might be recovery of the market and a rise in prices. He said that they were anxious to avoid speculation in raw materials, and that this would follow if they unloaded stocks too quickly. They were endeavouring to pla?e the articles with the users.The Chairman enquired whether bringing the price belowT tke American prices had been considered, and Mr. Larke replied that it had. but that it had not been done for the reasons he had stated.Lord Emmott said that he did not see why the articles should not be sold to speculators. He thought that, on the contrary, it would be a good thing to do, provided there were sufficient stocks retained to readjust the market if it became necessary to do so as a result of the speculators&apos; operations.Mr. Larke having given details of other raw materials which the Raw Materials Committee dealt with, and having explained the constitution of the Committee, the Chairman requested Sir Arthur Goldfinch to explain to the Conference the position in regard to textile raw materials.be recorded in the minutes of the proceedings; he added that he also understood that Mr. Long would be opposed to the proposal. He reminded the Conference that the Raw Materials Board originated in resolutions of the Imperial War Conference, 1918, and said that if the Board were dissolved the control of raw materials, from the point of view of the British Empire as a whole, would be seriously endangered.The Chairman replied that the dissolution of the Board would mean that the Secretary of State himself could deal with all such questions as might arise.It was agreed that Detailed questions relating to the supply of raw materials for the United Kingdom should no longer be dealt with byi ......    -  the Raw Materials Board, but by the Board of Trade ; andthat, should it be necessary for the Raw Materials Board to continue in existence, its functions should be confined to substantial questions of Imperial policy regarding raw materials, and to the questions concerning raw materials so far as the Dominions and colonies were concerned; otherwise the Board should be dissolved.
- Sir Arthur Goldfinch stated that the Ministry of Supply were now dealing with the stocks of wool, jute, hemp, flax, hides, &amp;c., and that the machinery consisted of various councils. He mentioned that this work had been under the War Office, but had been trans-ferred to the Ministry of Supply, The policy in regard to these articles was the same as that explained by Mr. Larke. They were endeavouring to sell at replacement value, which meant that they would lose on the transactions to a certain extent. He then explained the position in regard to the different commodities dealt with by his Department, and the stocks which were held, and explained that wool stood by itself. He said that the stocks of wool in the United States were larger than the stocks in this country, but that we had large reserves in Australia and New Zealand, and he mentioned that the United States kept their prices at English level. In regard to leather, stocks were smaller than before the war and all leather was either held by the Government or by users.Mr. Chapman then referred to the articles controlled by the Board of Trade. Egyptian cotton had been acquired by the British and Egyptian Governments, and countries were rationed; other cotton was free, and the Cotton Control Board had ceased to exist as a Control Board. The control of timber was being removed at the end of March.    The question of paper was under discussion.The Chairman pointed out to the Conference that now that they had heard the actual position in regard to raw materials and the machinery that existed for dealing with them, it seemed to him that they should consider the general policy that should be adopted in either holding or unloading the stocks held by the Government.Lord Inchcape said that he could see no advantage in holding up stocks. He agreed that the immediate effect would show a loes to the Government, but he thought it profitable to suffer that loss if by doing so the industry of the country were revived, as the profits of industry contributed very materially towards the Exchequer.Lord Emmott pointed out that the difficulty to be considered was that in later months the prices would fall, and he again referred to the question of avoiding speculation. It appeared that the objec-tion was that prices would immediately rise, but he himself did not see why prices should not be allowed to rise.The Chairman asked what the objection was to selling to British users at prices lower than the market pi ices.Sir Arthur Goldfinch stated that it had been decided by the Government that stocks must not be sold at lower prices to British purchasers than to Allies, such as France or Italy.The Secretary said that, so far as his recollection carried him, no such decision had been arrived at by the War Cabinet.Mr. Montagu thought that if stocks were sold below replacement value it might be undesirable for the articles, to be subject to the operations of speculators, but Lord Emmott pointed out that this difficulty would be met if sufficient stocks were retained in hand.Sir Percy Bates said that the Ministry of Shipping had been in a good position to follow the reasons for the present stagnation of industry. It seemed that one of the factors was the uncertainty which was current in regard to the Governments intentions, and that a large number of people were satisfied that the Government would take steps to assist industry, but the point that he himself laid most emphasis on &apos; was the fact that many businesses were content to carry on with a small turnover and few risks. He thought that it ought to be announced clearly that industry must not rely on Government action for stimulation, but must help itself, and he
also thought that it was very necessary to urge the Admiralty to release as much shipping as possible.The Chairman said that the question before the Conference was as to whether they should adopt the policy of getting rid of large stocks and of thus bringing the prices down to a pre-war level, and of encouraging manufacturers to produce articles in their place, or else to hold the stocks on the policy at present being followed, and thus delay the rapid revival of industry.Lord Ernie agreed that it should be adopted as a general policy that the stocks of raw materials should be unloaded at once, and that the prices should be brought down, as suggested by the Chairman, but he referred to a difficulty that might occur, which was in the case where the stock was not in hand, but had been brought forward.Sir Arthur Goldfinch pointed out that in regard to wool Australia would need to be consulted, as she regards England as a trustee.Mr. Larke deprecated the unloading of stocks, and explained that the Ministry of Munitions had a number of liquidation contracts, and he feared that unloading the stocks, and thus lowering the prices, would have the effect of discouraging producers and leaving them unable to meet demands later on when existing stocks might be exhausted.The Chairman pointed out that, on the contrary, by retaining stocks they were hampering the manufacturers, and he thought that this question had been regarded too carefully, and that it was necessary to look at it not only from the point of view enunciated by Mr. Larke on behalf of his Ministry, but also from the point of view of the stimulation of industry, with a view to the relief of unemployment.(At this stage, Mr. Chamberlain joined the Conference.)The Chairman explained the sense of the discussion to Mr. Chamberlain, who agreed that it was good policy to suffer a loss in regard to stocks if it meant that it would prevent unemployment. He thought that the aim should be to bring the prices down to post-war normal prices.The Chairman thought that, if it had the effect of stimulating industry, it might be well to get the prices below post-war normal level. He then said he thought himself that, notwithstanding all disadvantages, it is desirable to get rid of stocks as quickly as possible at any price, provided that (a.) We should not sell below replacement price, unless we have sufficient to prevent speculation ; (b.) We should only adhere to this policy until industry is restarted;(c.) There may be exceptions necessitated by Inter-Allied, Imperial, or other agreements ;and he would ask the Conference to consider the advisability of such a policy, and to put forward any objections to its adoption at the next Meeting.Restrictions of 4.  The Chairman then raised the question cf vestrictions on exports. exports and imports into this country.   He proposed to deal withthe question of exports first, and he enquired what were the restriction-tions at present in force regarding the export trade.Mr. Chapman said that, apart from the prohibitions affecting the &quot;blockade &quot; countries, there were very few restrictions now in force,[1205] C
and that they were largely confined to cases where it was anticipated there would be a shortage of material in the countryLord Emmott said that the Committee of which he was President had drawn up lists of commodities upon the exportation of which certain restrictions were placed, either absolutely or in regard to particular countries. He said that suggestions that were made to his Committee for relaxing the restrictions were very rarely turned down, unless it was pointed out by some Government Department that there were good reasons for maintaining the restrictions. He pointed out how, through the practice of placing restrictions in this respect, other countries had been driven to manufacture goods which before the war they obtained from this country, either entirely or in very&apos; large quantities, and in this connection he mentioned Holland, Japan, United States of America. Lord Emmott expressed the opinion that throughout the war neutrals were affected more by the military situation than by the power of the blockade, and he gave it as his opinion that the time had come when we should run the risk of allowing materials to percolate into Germany provided that thereby we could benefit our own trade.Mr. Chamberlain agreed with Lord Emmott&apos;s view, provided that Germany would get no more of any particular commodity than it might be safe for her to have. He pointed out that if we exported articles direct to Germany we were thereby increasing Germany&apos;s obligations to us, and it was of course apparent that the obligations of Germany to the rest of the world were at the present time already sufficiently great. If, however, we could supply goods through neutrals, allowing them, if they so desired, to forward them to Germany, the neutrals making their own terms for payment, we shall not only stimulate our trade, but we should place ourselves in an infinitely better position financially.Mr. Montagu agreed that the neutral market was at present by far the most profitable one for us to trade with.Mr. Cecil Harrnsworth said that the Ministry of Blockade were not concerned with the question of whether goods should go to Germany direct or via neutral countries, but only with maintaining the machinery ready to bring the blockade to bear on Germany should necessity arise. The machinery of blockade must perhaps bear hardly on industry, but its operations concerned mainly and chiefly those countries which might be termed &quot; economic bridgeheads of Germany,&quot; e.g., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland. He emphasised the view supported by the Allied naval and military leaders, and in particular by Marshal Foch himself, and by the War Cabinet, that when the Allied armies are reduced by demobilisation the threat of blockade is our best method of enforcing our will upon Germany. He explained that the Ministry of Blockade worked in close touch with the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee, and he said that the Committee keep constantly in view the desirability of making the blockade less oppresive. He also referred to the removal of restrictions announced only one or two days before on the exportation of materials to the south-east, including Bulgaria and Turkey and to the Black Sea. This had been done, as it was felt there was little fear of goods percolating into Geruaany.by this route.Lord Emmott agreed as to the undesirability of allowing too much material to enter Germany, but he questioned whether at the present time it was worth while simply for that reason entirely stopping the export of commodities like cotton and wool to neutral countries.The Chairman enquired whether there were any restrictions on other countries, such as Spain. For example, could rails or railway-carriage wheels be exported to S^ain at the present moment.
IlloLord Emmott replied that he did not think there were any restrictions, unless they were maintained on account of the demand in this country making it necessary to restrict export.Sir A. Goldfinch stated that the French Government were refusing to grant permits for the importation of certain commodities into France, e.g., light woollen goods.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that it was preferable to stimulate the export of goods to neutral countries rather than to the Allies, and thus keep the transactions on a cash basis, rectify our exchange, and get trade flowing,Sir James Stevenson enquired what the position was in regard to priorities, and whether there was a board or a committee dealing with the question.Mr. Larke replied that the War Priorities Committee had ceased to exist, and that no committee had apparently been established to take its place in regard to peace time priorities. He said priorities were still established in certain cases, but that there was no priority by definition.Further discussion ensued, in the course of which Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Manville laid emphasis on the point that this country must be prepared, if it were desired to maintain export trade, to go without its full requirements in order to satisfy overseas demands.It was agreed that Lord Emmott, Lord -Inchcape, Sir James Stevenson, Sir Arthur Goldfinch, and Mr. Chapman should form themselves into a Sub-Committee to revise drastically the regulations governing the restrictions on exports, and to report their recommendations as early as possible.Mr. Cecil Harmsworth thought that the Ministry of Blockade should be represented on the Sub-Committee; but it was pointed out that the question would be considered by the Sub-Committee purely from the point of view of trade interests, and before a definite decision was given the Naval and Military authorities would be consulted.Sir Herbert Walker then raised the point that other countries had placed orders recently for goods which we urgently required ourselves, e.g., certain railway materials, and he asked to be con-suited on any question relating to the removal of restrictions on exports of such materials.The Chairman asked Sir Herbert Walker whether the makers of railway material in this country were at the present time in possession of orders which would keep them fully employed, as from- various facts within his knowledge he doubted whether this was the case.Sir Herbert Walker replied that he thought the unemployment in the railway manufacturing trade was due mainly to the shortage of materials.The Chairman pointed out that the Conference had already come to the conclusion that in the majority of cases materials were in this country, and that the difficulties arose really by reason of the hold-up of commodities and the transition from war conditions to peace conditions.(Initialled)   A.
