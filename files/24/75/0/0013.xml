DONATION.Civilian Workers *will be remembered that the scheme now in force gives 29/- a week to the man, 26/- a week to the woman, 14/&apos;6d. to the hoy under 18, and ls/6d. a week to tho girl under 18, with children&apos;s allowance at the rate of 6/- a week for the first ahild, and 3/- aweek for each additional child under the age of 15, subject to certain qualifying conditions, which, for the purpose of this Memorandum,it is unnecessary to elaborate.    This scheme was instituted for a period of 6 months from the 29th November 1918, and in these 6 months, it provided for a maximum of 13 weeks11 donation to any one individual.   It will therefore be seen that a oertain ever-inoreasing number of policies -estimated at about 40-50,000 per week - will expire on and after the -26th February 1919, and that the scheme itself comes to an end on the 25th May, 1919.It becomes necessary to consider what scheme shall take theIplace of that now in force,   I had hoped that it would he possible to. substitute for the donation scheme general contributory insurance, as foreshadowed in the original announcement which gave the terms of the present scheme.      This alternative has been most carefully investigate sd, but I regret that the difficulties of bringing it into operation in the time available are of so great and varied a character that I cannot see my way to recommend at this moment any such prooedure.   Another alternative, viz. that cf confining the scheme ta the trades insured against unemployment has also been examined but appears tc be equally inapplicable to the present emergenoy.      flor example, it would fail to include such workers as tram and bus conductresses, women in railway service, and also such industries as the textile trades.    It will be remembered that in the oetton trade, unemployment is at the moment very great.      It 1b, howevor, essential to consider any new ^proposals from the point of view of their effect upon the general contributory soheme when formulated./notwithstanding
notwithstanding that three months have elapsed since the Armistice, no considerable movement haa been affected in the rehabilitation of industry, and unemployment amongst civilians is still on an ascending scale.     (I attach a table showing policies remaining lodged, excluding those unsigned for the last six days, which shows that on January 51st, no less than 678,703 such policies were current.     It is estimated that on the 7th February the number was 734,000),     It would therefore appear to me that it is politically impossible to oonsider either the entire withdrawal of unemployment benefit in some shape or another, or its restriction to the trades which are ccmpulsorily insured against unemployment, seeing that of the 67^,703 policies remaining lodged on the 31st January, no less than 325,000 are held by workers ia uninsurable occupations.Assuming this to be the view of ihe Government, it would appear that the following lines of policy may be considered -(a) To continue today&apos;s scheme of unemployment donation for a further period of 6 months,(b) To reduce today1s rate of donation to that originally embraced by the Government, namely, 24/- a week for men and 20/- a week for women, with other conditions as at present,(c) To continue today&apos;s scheme with the rate of donation at 21/- or 20/- a week for men and 18/- or 17/- aweek, for women, or such other variation as may be thought wise, for a further period of 6 months, other conditions being the same1.In regard to (a),, I am clear that today&apos;b rate acts as an actual deterrent to employment, and should be abandoned; but it must be understood that considerable opposition to any such course will be encountered, and any such prooedure will undoubtedly lead to agitation and difficulty.   Nevertheless, I strongly advocate a reduction in tho rates of donation.In regard to (b) and fo), it is a matter for the v/ar Cabinet tc decide which they prefer.     I think myself that fc)
is possible, more particularly if accompanied by a reduction in the c&amp;st of living.   I understand that it can only be a question of a short time before the loaf at its present value will cease to be a cost to the State.   It may be that it could be further cheapened without any or at worst a small cost.   If at the samo timo the price of other articles of foad could be lowered, it would be cf material assistance in carrying through this reduced scale of donation.If any one of those alternatives ic accepted, suspension of payments of benefits under the existing contributory scheme for the period that may be decided upon will have to continue.In any case, I should deprecate the present dependents&apos; allowance being varied, and for the reason that I do not^ think the Government should lay themselves open to a charge being made against them that in gonuino cases of unemployment, through no fault of the would-be employee, the health of the rising generation might be affected by insufficient children&apos;s allowance.I think it inadvisable, in view of the present condition of industry, ta contemplate a period of less than six months for the duration of the continuation scheme.    With regard to the policies on which 13 weeks1 donation has been paid, I propose that donation shall not be continued unless the applicant satisfied the appropriate tribunal that he or she is normally in employment, i&amp; genuinoly seeking work, and is unable to cbtain it, and further that the Government should delay their announcement of the continuing scheme till perhaps 10th March or such date as ovonts may show to bo wise,I am clear that a differentiation must bo made between 0    Ireland and Great Britain, and that Ireland as a whole must be excluded from this continuation scheme.   A Memorandum has boan circulated to the tfar Cabinet in regard to Ireland, and I would suggest that tho variation in the scheme that is
there recommended should be continued in Ireland after the25th May at whatever rate of benefit the Government may decide on as applicable to Great Britain,A Sub-Committee of the Labour He settlement Committee,with Sir David Shackleton as Chairman, has formulated a schemeof general State insurance on a contributory basis on thefollowing lines: -(1)   All employed persons over 16 to be included, except non-manual workers in receipt of more than  160 per annum, and persons entitled to receive payment under a Super animation Act.(2)   Weekly rate of contribution to be 3d. (women 2-g-d). each from the employed, the employer ana the State.(3)   Weekly rate of benefit to be 15/- for men,12/6d, for women, with lower rates of oon-tribution and benefit for boys and girls under 18,(4)   Soheme to remain in operation for say 3 years, and then to be reconsidered in the light of experience.(5)   Eo exemption to be permitted of particular trades from compulsory payment of contribution-butions, but special arrangements aa to administration of benefits to be allowed.A scheme on the above lines, in addition to requiringlegislation, will involve negotiations with a large number of trades Unions and Employers&apos; Associations, and also with personsrepresenting industries whloh are 6ither not organised at all or are only partly organised, such aa domestic service and agriculture.   It appears accordingly essential that negotiations should be commenced immediately, with a view to the introductionof a Bill as early as possible, so that she new scheme may comeinto foroe on 25th November next, the date upon which theproposed extension of the donation scheme will come to an end,It is a matter for consideration whether the Billembodying the scheme of general State insurance should not form part of the Bill which I understand may be introduced to dealvrith labour conditions generally.
I accordingly aak for decisions on the followingpoints.(1)    Whether the donation scheme ia to continue, and, if so, what rates are to he paid, and over what period it is to he operative.(8)    Whether the scheme, if extended, should apply to Ireland, and, if ao, what modifioatlons, if any, should he made in it.( ) Whether there ia at onoe to be introduced a soheme of general State insurance on a con-tributory basis on the lines recommended fcy Sir David Shackleton&quot;a Committee, or on any other line a.f Jet.)   t/g J e&amp;n*z*
