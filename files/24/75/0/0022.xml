the War Cost Fund of approximately 840 millions can be obtained from the enemy countries &quot;without impinging seriously on the revenues required for their internal administration, and it is probable that this annual sum could be considerably increased if the Allies were prepared to take over certain of the potential revenue-producing assets of Turkey and develop them in their own interest.In this connection the Federation desire to call attention to the fact that the extra War taxation imposed on the enemy countries has been negligible and consequently that a large fund of untouched war profits must exist in those countries.The Federation are further of opinion that while it would for obvious reasons be undesir-able to force the enemy countries to repudiate their debt, they should be expected, as this debt is almost entirely held internally, to refrain from making any provision for the reduction of debt until the claims of the Allies have been satisfied.The Federation would further call attention to the securities held and property owned out-side those countries by enemy subjects, and to debts which may be owing on balance to enemy subjects or enemy countries by subjects of other States, and would suggest that it might well be required of the enemy governments that all these assests should be handed over to the inter-allied commission, the private individuals concerned in the enemy countries being repaid by their respective governments.The Federation recommend that in any case an inter-Allied Commission should be instituted, charged with the duty of receiving any specific revenues allocated to the service of the War Cost Fund, and of distributing them pro rata to the Allied and Associated Powers. They are further of opinion that it should be a matter for very careful consideration whether the Commission should not supervise and control the total revenue of the enemy countries.It appears to the Federation that such a course would have much to recommend it. In the first place, absolute security woidd be provided against any attempt to conceal revenue and to build up a secret fund to be expended upon armaments with the object of a sudden or treacherous attack. The possibilities of such an attack, have been greatly increased by the development of aircraft, and can scarcely be guarded against in any other manner short of pro-longed and complete military occupation of the countries concerned, since it would manifestly be impossible to trust any Government in any enemy country, however outwardly reformed, not to resort to some such procedure in view of the character and views held by the present generation of the enemy peoples as the result of many years of unscrupulous political education.This procedure would not, of course, involve any actual collection of revenue by the Allied authorities, and should not involve any interference with the ordinary development or administration of the countries concerned, since the Allied Commission would merely retain the portions allocated to the service of the War Cost Fund, and simply pass on to the different admin-istrative departments of those countries the sums designated for their use by their own Government. It is even possible that such a procedure might be welcomed by the populations of the enemy coun-tries as a protection against any attempt at a military reaction, against undue taxation levied in an attempt to restore the military power of the enemy countries at the same time as the debt was being liquidated, and against any attempt to plunge the countries again into War.In conclusion, the Federation would again urge most emphatically the imperative necessity of obtaining a substantial, contribution towards the cost of the War from the enemy countries. Unless the War burden on the Allied countries can be lightened to an appreciable extent industrial competition with the countries which have not suffered so severely, and even with the enemy countries themselves whose works have not been injured and whose capital has not been impaired by War taxation, will prove impossible.It will then become a question for this country, not of the shortening of hours, the raising of wages and the numerous costly social reforms to which all classes are looking forward so eagerly, but of a gradually-increasing industrial stagnation ending very possibly in complete economic ruin, in which all classes employers and employed will suffer alike.The Federation fully realises the difficulties which may lie in the way of exacting sufficient payment from the enemy countries, but that these difficulties should be met and overcome is an essential preliminary to the economic recovery of this country, and in their opinion no considera-tions whatever should deter His Majesty&apos;s Government from insisting that full payment shall be demanded and the maximum possible payment exacted.
Eef. 78/340/W.3.The Federation of British Industries,39, St. James&apos;s Street,London, S.W. 1.METHODS OF  OBTAINING AN   INDEMNITY FROM THE CENTRAL POWERS.I.-GERMANY.After going into as many sources of taxable wealth as possible in the time available, there appears to be no doubt that Germany could pay annually at least  600,000,000 to the Allies towards the cost of the war.Part of this could be transferred by taking&apos; raw products in part payment and other valuables such as art treasures which cannot be manufactured to-day.The most obvious tangible asset is raw material, and Germany could be made to pay in potash, iron or other mineral resources, and above all in timber.Even, here, however, care has to be taken lest we undermine our own raw product industries, retard the development of resources within our own Empire and end by making ourselves dependent on Germany for essential raw products.Considering art treasures, it may be well to point out that Germany has a very large number and their total value, if sold in the open market, particularly in America-, over a period of years, would be enormous, but no precise figures can be given.It would appear, however, that if any such idea were adopted, the guiding principle should be laid down that national art treasures should not be taken, It would be not merely a crime, but folly, to take say German mediaeval bronze work from the cathedrals of Germany and sell them abroad. Half their artistic value consists in the fact that they form part of the building&quot; and that they are the expression of German art of the period. Great cathedrals and art treasures are the heritage of the whole world, not of a particular country, and by damaging them we should damage not merely Germany, but ourselves as well.This does not apply so strongly in the case of movable art treasures such as German pictures, though to a certain extent it still holds good.On the other hand, Germany has acquired (not always by purchase) art treasures from all parts of the world, to which she has no further moral claim than the fact of possession; to cite but two examples, the Sistine Madonna at Dresden and the Greek sculptures from Asia Minor and elsewhere in the Berlin Museum.These are tangible assets, immediately obtainable and easily convertible into money.In the accompanying figures some of the chief possible sources of revenue have been shown, but it is not claimed that all have been exhausted. Bather they should be considered as indicative and suggestive, as are also the taxes suggested. It is obvious, for example, that these taxes would have to be graded, but this might well be left to the German Government itself and merely the average demanded. Further, two factors must be borne in mind, mutually contradictory : G) In certain cases the same amount of receipts will not be obtained after the war .as before. For example, of the twenty-seven million odd tons of iron ore raised in Germany, nearly seventy-three per cent, came from the Minette mines in Lorraine. With the loss of this province Germany&apos;s production of ore will fall to a comparatively small figure, and even before the war it was not sufficient for her own smelting works. On the other hand the inclusion of German Austria in Germany will mean that she will control the Styrian mines which will largely redress the balance.17772 !
(2) On the other hand, it is known that in certain cases the German figures were far below the actual amount. This policy of misleading the outside world was deliberately adopted for various reasons.For example, there is excellent reason for believing that the total receipts of the German railways were far higher than those given and the secret fund thus obtained was devoted to the secret service, the Army, etc.It does not, however, follow that we shall even to-day be able to find out exactly what these railways do earn.Another point which also has been borne in mind is that the heavier taxation is, the higher the cost of living and therefore the higher wages must be. These accumulative influences might bring an industry to a standstill even if the immediate tax would not. For these reasons care has been taken not to attempt to exact the uttermost farthing and a liberal deduction has been made to allow for decreased production and also certain revenue producing sources have been left untapped to enable Germany to raise additional taxation for her own needs, particularly to pay some interest on her own debts. The taxes here considered are-in addition to any in force in Germany in 1913.Population and Area in 1913.Total area 208,780 square miles.Population in 1910, 64,925,993 or 310-4 per square mile. Annual rate of increase 1-36.This was tending to decline and so if we consider it to be 1-25 we shall be within the mark.Therefore the total in 1913 = 0. 67,363,493.Note There are reasons for suspecting, however, that the official figures were misleading and below the real total.The Total Imperial Ebvenue and Expenditure.Revenue in 1910       ............  147,170,965Revenue in 1913       ............  184,801.660Expenditure in 1913 (Ordinary)         ...        ...  178,869,035Expenditure in 1913 (Extraordinary chiefly military)  5,931,725Details.

This action, far from damaging the economic foundations of Germany, would strengthen them as the men and material thus released could be diverted to productive industry and so help to pay the extra taxes. Moreover, the figures do not include the secret sums which were annually spent on military purposes.How the Revenue was Raised Important Items.(1)   Customs Duty paid     ............ 44,263,500Excise ...............    26,111,500Total therefore          ............ 70,375,000Compared with 1910............ 62,148.000Increase in three years          ...        ...        ... 8,227,000(2)   By Stamps, 1910        ...                   ..&apos;        ... 9,927.000By Stamps, 1913      ............ 12,389,000(3)  The Railways paid officially a profit of   ...... 2,263,530(4)  Net profit on Post, etc. ...        ......... 7,151,705(5)  The Federal contribution, i.e., sums paid by the State to the Imperial Budget and assessed at a rateper head, 1913          ............ 12,770,405Alsace-Lorraine paid of this     ... 361,485
Briefly there seems no reason why about  100,000,000 saved from military expense .could not be paid over to the Allies, leaving some  85,000,000 for Imperial functions.State Revenues.Each State had its own revenue, but as these were in the main devoted to purposes likely to cost as much after the war as before, we cannot expect to obtain much from them; but the following facts are of sufficient interest to justify their inclusion. ;EE venue and finance.Marks.     -Total Revenue including Federal  and imperial, 191].......... 8,534,000,000             425,700,000Ordinary Imperisal Revenue   ...        ... 2,935,600,000             146,780.000,,.,,    Extraordinary   Revenue   (mostly   forMilitary purposes)          ...... 216,000.000               10,800,000Therefore Federal States Revenues equalled   5,382,400,000 269,120,000i. . .

The total wealth of Germany in 1.913 was given by Helferich at  15,000.000,000, but there is every reason to suppose that this was a low estimate.Total German Imperial Debt in 1913        ...        ...     246,112,100Total War Debt in 1917.........        ...  5.000,000,000Interest required annually ...      350,000,000 to  400,000,000   i &apos;These figures are according to Heir Dernburg who added that they had only voted 25 to 37J million in extra taxes and had lost 12 million in Customs.National Industrial Wealth.As we cannot hope to get more than 100 million from the Imperial Revenue, we must turn to possible sources of new taxation. It will be recognised that the repudiation by Germany of her own debt would shake the financial fabric of the. whole world and must be avoided at all costs. Since Dernburg spoke the amount added to Germany&apos;s war debt makes a total of about  8,750,000,000, and it is obvious that she will be hard put to it to pay the interest, much less establish a sinking fund. The special war treasure at Spandau in gold was only  6,000,000 and even if it still exists can therefore practically be ignored in any general, calculation.

There remain, however, two very important sources which must be considered in some detail, namely, an income tax and a tax on the number of workmen employed in industry and possibly also in other capacities.If, however, we concentrate attention only on industry, we find that over 14,343,000 in 1907 were employed in industry and commerce, etc., and by 1913, the number must have been at least 15,500,000.Industrial Establishments.A. 1 5 persons employed.B. 6 50 persons employed.C. 51 and over.In 1907 :-Establishments employing same.

This sum is far from crushing when one considers what British employers have to pay towards State Insurance. If, moreover, this tax was made universal and included domestic servants, agriculturists, etc., it would produce at least double. If, however, it he considered that it would press unfairly on certain classes, this cannot be contended in the case of industrial establishments since hands are only employed, as a rule, in order that they may produce more&apos; than they cost.Income Tax.Of course, as in Great Britain, this tax would doubtless be graded from 2s. 3d. up to say 10s., but, if wo demanded it, should average out at 5s. on all incomes, we should obtain air enormous sum annually.In 1913 Helferich declared, that the income of Germany was at least  2,000,000,000, and so far as can be judged he was under rather than over the mark. However, we must expect a very considerable decrease in the income of Germany for many years. Further there-are certain classes of the community it is particularly hard to assess accurately.Nominally a 5s. tax in. the pound on       ......  2,000,000,000Should produce ...        ............ 500,000.000Subtract for reduced earnings, cost of collection, etc. 200,000,000And for those who escape their share       ...        ... 100,000,000We shall have left as a minimum   200,000,000This sum over and above the small income tax previously levied by some of the States should be easily obtainable. It may be noted that Helferich also reckoned that the German nation saved per annum  500,000,000.Thus we arrive at a grand total from all sources of  752,808,215 annually.It may, however, be considered that not enough margin has been allowed for decreased&apos; national wealth due to the war and, in particular, to the hostility with wdiich Germans and German goods will be regarded elsewhere for many years, nor for her own necessary taxes,, also for cost of collection.Let us therefore deduct  152,808,215, leaving a net annual sum of  600,000,000.Thus we come to the position that we can hardly expect to obtain more than six hundred millions, whereas possibly three times as much would be required annually to pay off the whole Allied debt and interest as well, within about forty years the most satisfactory way is perhaps to make Germany pay off the capital of our debt, while we bear the interest and recover as much of it as possible from her other accomplices,, who could pay in addition approximately  240,000,000 sterling.

II.-AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.INTRODUCTION.The financial position of this ramshackle Empire was hopeless even when war broke out. In addition and partly because of this, her figures are far less clear and precise and much less reliable than those of Germany. In many cases they do not appear to exist and even when they do the system of showing them is misleading.Further, the collapse and disintegration of the Empire renders it doubtful how far such figures will give any true criterion at all as to what she can pay towards the cost of the war she was instrumental in making. At the same time it must be pointed out that her unsound position was mainly due to her political difficulties and to racial differences rather than to lack of valuable resources, and these, now that the political difficulties are being solved on rational lines, should be capable of great developments.Will devasted Serbia, however, which is taking over most of the Yugoslav States, have to pay the corresponding share of the bill of the Empire which attacked her&apos;? Will the new Bohemian republic, which revolted and joined the Allies, similarly have to pay those Allies a tribute for years?  If not, hardly anything worth having is left.German. Austria and. Magyar Hungary (the latter only one-third of old Hungary) are the only really guilty members of these nationalities. Austria has nothing of economic value except certain mines in Styria. Hungary has of course rich agricultural lands, but these can only pay a very limited amount.The bulk of the railways, of the population and of the mineral and agricultural wealth of the Empire, is passing into new hands. Even such tangible assets as ships will largely be claimed by the new States. As some guide, certain figures are given, but it will be evident that their value is problematic, and that Germany will have to contribute by far the largest share. To meet these points care has been taken to assess the Austro-Hungarian share at a lower amount than that of Germany. At the same time it is felt that the new States arising out of the debris of Austro-Hungary should be prepared to bear their share of the cost of freeing them.Aeba and Population.Austria including Bukovina.There were altogether ill Autria some 10,000.000 Germans, the difference  being scattered over a wide area of non-German districts.   Vienna in 1910 had 2,131,498. Hungary (including Croatia and Slavonia).AreaPopulation about  ...

It is only right, however, to point out that Serbia, Bohemia and Poland will doubtless expect to raise for military purpose from their areas, and therefore if we reckon the saving at . 5,000,000, it will be as much as we can count on with any certainty.Commerce of the Common Customs territory : 1909. &apos; 1913.Imports.

III.-BULGARIA AND TURKEY.In the case of both these countries a somewhat different method must be adopted than is necessary in the case of Germany and the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.These two States were largely industrial and whereas Bulgaria and Turkey are back-ward States with, nevertheless, great potentialities, Bulgaria, on the whole, is fairly sound, and her administration has, in the main, been fairly honestly and well run, while Turkey is thoroughly unsound financially, largely because of a corrupt and incompetent Government.Both, however, possess great potential wealth and the policy of the Allies should be to develop these with the avowed object of obtaining an increased revenue from which an annual instalment for.the indemnity could be obtained.To do this the soundest policy appears to be that outlined below which practically means : (1) Placing the Allies in charge of the revenues of these two States in the position of the Administrator of a bankrupt firm.(2) Take over all loans, treasury bills, etc. due to Germany as part of Germany&apos;s investments abroad; the total to be deducted from the amount of indemnity Germany has to pay to the Allies. This step is essential if we are to rescue Bulgaria and Turkey from the grip of Germany.(3) Deal with the inflation of the currency in Turkey and. if necessary, in Bulgaria also, on the lines laid down later.(4) Claim that all present railways and all future concessions for methods of penetration with Turkey or Bulgaria should be reserved for the Allies and similarly all mineral or land concessions also. The Allied Board of Control to have power to allocate&apos;such concessions to private companies, etc., if desirable on condition that such bodies shall pay an annual royalty or percentage or make some other similar financial return to the Board of Control, which sum should be set aside towards the annual instalment of the indemnity.From these sources it should he quite possible to raise an average sum annually from Bulgaria of about  31,000,000 for forty years, making a total of  1.240.000,000, while from Turkey at least twenty-one millions annually could be raised, making a total over forty years of  840,000.000.A Method of Stabilising Turkish Finance. &apos;In order to bring order out of chaos drastic methods appear necessary in the case of Turkey.   It is therefore suggested that the following steps should be taken.As regards our claims on the Turkish Government for goods and properties requisitioned and seized by them, the conditions of peace should provide that the loss due to the depreciated currency should be borne by the Turkish Government. It is believed that most of the claims have been made in sterling and they should be paid in sterling.The  1 sterling currency note to-day is worth P. 350 paper the  1 sterling in gold fetches P. 498 paper.The tendency is towards further depreciation.Naturally this cuirency question is the burning problem of the day. The only solution is the very drastic one of withdrawing the about  T.160,000,000 of floating paper and replacing
it by a new paper issue of  T.40,,000,000 (guaranteed by the Allied Powers) in the proportion of. say four of the old paper to one of the new, making the former illegal tender after a certain date.The Allied Powers would take over from Germany (as part of the indemnity) Turkey&apos;s debt to her, and the German treasury bonds (which are payable in gold) foi-. T.160,000,000-given to Turkey as a guarantee for the currency issue-would be collected and administered by the Allies as they fall due in five to eleven years in order to &apos;1. Withdraw the new issue of  T.40,000,000.2. Meet Allied claims of all sorts.3. Cover the loss on remittance of past and future coupons on Turkish loans, etc,4. Meet other contingencies.Turkey would be left with her pre-war debt only and her financial equilibrium would be possible. The currency problem would be solved and a stable position brought about. Allied claims etc. would be met and paid by advances against the  T.120,000,000 of German Treasury bonds in the hands of the Allies ( T.160,000,000- T.40,000,000 for the new issue). A consortium of banks might be entrusted with this operation for account of the Allied Governments.The scheme is drastic but it presents a radical solution.Such a drastic reduction of currency does not appear to be so essential in the case of Bulgaria, but a similar control of her entire revenue would be necessary and the whole of her war debt, which is now about  1.300,000,000 would, as above stated, be taken over by the Allies as part of the German indemnity and the interest paid by Bulgaria to the Board of Control. When doing so, however, a careful investigation would have to be made into the conditions under which Germany made these advances so as to ascertain whether the conditions as to repayment, etc. were reasonable.As bearing upon this subject, a few details of the debts of Bulgaria and Turkey are given below but the very latest figures are not yet available.The total debt of Bulgaria in April, 1918, was ... c.  320,000,000 The pre-war debt was............c.      26,000,000Against which can be set such assets as the State Railways, Harbours, etc. Therefore we may assess her total war debt as ...        ...   294,000,000Her revenue in 1912 was......        ......     7,600,000Her revenue in 1918 was    ............    19,244,000(which may be expected in the near future to be considerably more).In short, Bulgaria is solvent at present; Turkey, on the contrary, is bankrupt owing to mal-administration, farming of the taxes, etc.In March, 1917, Djavid Bey estimated that Turkey&apos;speace revenue would be about         ...        ...  T.27,000,000Her expenditure about.............  T.41,000,000In 1914 her external debt was    .........  T.150,000.000In 1918 her external debt was......        ...  T. 350,000,000And the interest due     ............  T.21,000,000as against  9,000,000 in 1914.In addition up to April. 1917, , T.85,295,940 was issued in the shape of paper. Of this  T.75,000,000 is to be recalled within twelve years and is covered by German Treasury bonds.   Since then the total has been increased to the figure given earlier on.
It must also be pointed out that since large areas of old Turkey are to pass under fresh control, it follows according to former precedents that they will have to bear their proportion of Turkey&apos;s pre-war debt and also probably of the indemnity now dijeA If some of these areas pass actually into the hands of one or other of the Allied Powers, if&apos;will be open to them to collect their quota from their new subjects or not as they think best; but any action of this sort will in no way effect the share of other members of the Alliance.Thus, with her pre-war debt reduced, her currency restored and an able and honest administration of her revenues established, Turkey should speedily become a prosperous State. At the same time, the working of the various concessions granted by the Board of Control will not only result in an entirely new revenue to be devoted to paying off the indemnity but also increase the prosperity of the people in Asia Minor.Finally, the fact must be emphasized that in Bulgaria and even more in Asia Minor, there are numerous natural resources only awaiting development, the output from which, besides raising a revenue and benefiting the native population would confer a great benefit also on the whole industrial world, which needs badly many of the raw products now lying almost untouched,TOTAL   OBTAINABLE.Therefore Germany should pay annually Austria and Hungary Bulgaria Turkey   ... 600,000,000 188,000,000 31,000,000 21,000,000Grand total annually  840,000,000
