4&amp;$.J*so^. 13PROPOSED IKCHBA.SED RELEASE OP SPIRITS FROM BQ&amp;P.1$0WfiiimytJMmm by gagOlgjgRAL CQUJRQL BOARD (IIQUOH IHAjTIO]1.   The Central Control Board reoognise that there is at the present tine an insistent demand on the part of some sections of the public for inoreased supplies of spirits, and that at least in so far as it is a demand for spirits for medicinal purposes, in connection with the prevalence of influenza and other forms *f eiokness, it requires to be seriously considered.2.   On the evidence before them, the Board are not satisfied that the scarcity of spirits plays an appreciable part in the question of industrial unrest,   $hey are disposed to think that the shortage of beer of suitable quality stands in closer relation to industrial unrest than the scarcity of spirits, and further that, as regards spirits, the dis-oontent arises partly from the fact that bottled spirits have praotioally disappeared from tho market, and that those persons in&apos;tho middle and other classes who have hitherto bought whisky by the bottle, are now unable to obtain any supplies at all.   Added to this there is the feeling among all classes that it is sometimes impossible, and often unduly difficult, to obtain spirits on a medical certificate, even in cases of serious illness,3,   This last-mentioned grievance is undoubtedly one whioh ought to be mrt immediately, and that this was the board&apos;s view on the subject was intimated by lord D^ibernon to Mr; clynes as lon  ago as the beginning of last December,   Beforereferring to it in further detail, however, the Board think it advisable to call attention to some general considerations concerning the supply of intoxicating liquor x.hich ought to be .borLo/
-   137borne in mind before any decision is arrived at on the particular cjuostitn of spirits.4,   Since the 1st April, 1917, there has been severe restriction of the permitted output of beer.   The effect of this restriction has, been mitigated by a large reduction in the gravity, and now that the War Cabinet has recently sanctioned a 25$ increase on the statutory barrelage, it may be estimated that the volume of beer on the market, compared with the volume of three or four years ago, will reach the ratio of about 5 to 7.   The actual shortage of volume is, thereforeprobably not so great as is commonly supposed, but this volume is only secured by reducing a very large proportion of the beer to a strength at which it ceases to-be aoceptable to large numbers of the drinkers of beer.5.   Consequently, for some time to oome it will probably remain the case that great numbers of persons who desire alcohol, and who would prefer to take it in the form of beer, will find themselves unable to obtain, in some oasesj any beer at all, in other cases, sufficient beer for their ordinary requirements, and in still other cases, any beer which they care to drink.    Evidence is accumulating that it is this last mentioned class of case whioh is responsible for a great deal of the discontent.-    it is not surprising that persons who thus fail to obtain alcoholic refreshment to their taste should make good the deficiency by drinking spirits, if spirits are available.   This, in fact, is already happening on a considerable scale, with the result that not only are persons who always have been spirit-drinkers having their heavily rostrictod supply encroachedupon/
138upon by persons who fiore previously oe-er drinkers bux aluo that a large new class of spirit-drinkers is bein&amp; created.6.   It is not possible to ignore the temperance aspect of the question, and while it may be agreed that the present level of sobrioty for the odmntry as a whole is remarkably high, the Board submit that the conversion of beer-drinkers into spirit-drinkers is contrary to the national interests, and they fear that the process ox conversion would be accelerated by any scheme for placing more spirits on the market, without at the same time taking steps to mee-t the normal requirements of beer-drinkors.   It therefore now appears urgent to consider v/hether (without, of course, going back to tho heavy gravities prevalent till recently) seme improve-ment cannot be offeetod in the quality of the beer available for consumption, before any general additional release of spirits is permitted.7*   As suggested above, the demand for more spirits is largely due to the fact that bottled spirits have praotioally disappeared.    Under the Spirit Prices Order it is muoh more profitable to sell whisky in small quantities than by bottle, with the result not only that publio houses sell all their normal supplies of spirits in small quantities, but also, it is believed, that the stocks of off-lloensees, on which customers who have usually bought spirits by bottle depend, are diverted to the bar trade in tho public house.   In the Board1s view, tho scarcity of spirits, so far as it is due to those causes, should be remedied by administrative action, whether by regulation of price or otherwise.8.   The provision of sufiioient supplies of spirits formedicinal/
139medicinal purposes stands on a different footing.   So far from opposing a well-grounded medical damand for tho provision of spirits for this purpose, the Board are entirely in favour of meeting and satisfying it without reserve.   They suggest that, among the steps to be taken for this purpose,&apos; it might be made an offence for any licensed retailer of spirits to refuse to meet at once any demand, supported by a medical certificate, for a bottle or any smaller quantity of spirits, provided that he has spirits in stock in any part of his premises at the time of the demand.9.   On the whole, therefore, and apart from the question of the   supply of spirits for siclrnoss, the present proposal to increase the amount of spirits permitted to be released from bond appears to the Board to be open to serious objections which ought to be carefully weighed before the proposal is adopted.   Even now, with tho recent increase allowed in tho output of beer, the amount of absolute alcohol oonsumed in the form of beer only roaches about 45Jy of the average pre-war consumption, a figure which is exactly the same proportion as the amount allowed in the form of spirits.10*   It is doubtful whether an increase in spirits (apart from such increase as may bo allowed on medical grounds) should be granted until it has been seen what is the effect of the recent increase in the output of- beor upon the public demand for alcoholic refreshment and upon inebriety.   Further, it is suggested that, when an increase is allowed,, precautions against conversion of beer-drinkers into spirit-drinkers should be adopted, by taking measures to preserve the balance between boor and spirits on the basis of the comparison of their respective pre-war consumption.
