FT&quot;J I     This Docunwnt is the Property &amp;f     *2gjjjjjl - ----------------.------,1      W      -His Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Government.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.j,srvINDIA OFFICE,WHITEHALL, S.W. 1,14th February 1919. Dear Prime Minister,Have you patience or time to read a few observations which I propose to make on the subject of Russia? It is possible that J may be after the fair, but I am more capable of! submitting them to you in writing than in speech owing to the fact that I am nearly voiceless.It seems to me that there are two kinds of Bolshevism with which Ave are confronted. There is first and foremost the Russian Bolshevist Government, supported by a military organisation, daily improving in morale, daily more formidable in strength. It seems to me that there is only one way of dealing with this if we want to deal with it, namely, to declare Avar on it and beat it. This is a formidable undertaking, costing men, which no country has to spare, and money, at a time when we want every penny.You in Paris often said that Ave could not embark 011 a limited warfare, and that is true. If you declare war or if you go to war you must be prepared, if it is necessary, to put all your strength into the war. Our experience in the German war just concluded is conclusive. We started with a desire to maintain a voluntary system of recruitment; we were forced to conscription. We started Avith the principle that you yourself formulated, &quot; Business as usual&quot; ; Ave had to abandon all business. In fact, once you embark on an enterprise, you must carry it through.Noav it is suggested that you can back the anti-Bolshevists in Russia by means of money, of which we have none too much, or of equipment and material, and that will be sufficient. But surely if we give money and material it means that we want to beat the Bolshevists, and if the money and material are not sufficient we shall be told that everything Ave have given Avill be thrown away unless something more follows, that we are just 011 the verge of establishing an anti-Bolshevist Government,, that on the strength, of Avhat Ave have given forces have appeared which depend upon our continuing to give, that we cannot leave them in the lurch, that to stop at the point at which avc have decided to stop will be a source of new strength to our Bolshevist enemies, and we shall go from small, things to big things.It lias been the same all over the world. Who could have dreamt that the expedition to Basra would have grown into one of the biggest and most decisive expeditions of the Avar ? Our commitments in the Caucasus, in Trans-Caspia, and apparently now in Esthonia, are examples of what I mean.Apart from this, I maintain that there are not in sight forces in Russia which give any sufficient promise within any definite time of being able to profit by the munitions and the money that we send them.But the War Office really do not intend merely to send munitions and money. The Secretary of State for War yesterday made that quite clear. What he has in mind is volunteers for Russia, either what are called &quot; technical &quot; volunteers, or even more volunteers. Well, yes, but these volunteers will have to be paid for by the over-taxed British taxpayer. They will have to be supported if they are in danger by other volunteers, and possibly by conscripted men. They are men withdrawn from the many uses for Avhicli our man-power is Avanted now in our own interests They are lives that may be lost, and further they will be in the main men who would other-wise volunteer for the essential purpose of achieving a peace against our enemies. It is quite true that there are some men (my own brother is one of them) Avho would volunteer to fight against the Bolshevists, but Avould not volunteer to remain in the Army for any other purpose, but the majority of such volunteers will be men attracted by the pay, the regular food, and so forth. In so far as Ave have got to retain conscripts in the Army to achieve peace with our oavii enemies, Ave are going to havo a difficult political time. Every volunteer who replaces a conscript helps the political situation. Every volunteer sent to Russia, therefore, increases your political difficulties.And noAV I come to&apos;the political difficulties. The other form of Bolshevism is not the Bolshevism of the Russian Government, but the Bolshevism, the smash-every-thing-ism, to hell with the existing order of things, whicli is cosmopolitan and arisesSS 53  60  2/19
out of overstrain and economic conditions. Every sacrifice you ask any country to make to fight against Russian Bolshevism increases and enforces the circumstances which promote international or spontaneous Bolshevism, and I am certain that as you overthrow the Russian Bolshevist military machine, you will all the time be adding recruits to your Bolshevists in this&apos; country, who are not Bolshevists out of support of the Russian Government, but Bolshevists as a political pa^ty. There are Liberals, Conservatives, Socialists and Bolshevists in every country and we have got them here. Demobilisation, the spending of our money on ourselves, the saving of the money that we can save, that is the way to fight our own Bolshevism. We can do none of these things if we fight the Russian Bolshevism. If we light the Russian Bolshevists we are allies of our own Bolshevists.   Which will you choose ?Again I go to my own interests to give you illustrations. I agree with you most emphatically that all the Allied nations are concerned to send men, if they can find them, money, if they can spare it, material, to support the States which they have promised to support against attack from anybody, against Russian Bolshevism included. But 1 assert emphatically that there is no evidence that the Russian Bolshevist Army has any desire to proceed militarily against any country which was not a part of Russia at the beginning of the war. That they are interested in propaganda in other countries, I agree ; but, as 1 have said above, you cannot counteract that propaganda by military expeditions.I next say that there is very little evidence indeed that the Russian Bolshevist Army wants to attack those parts of Russia which we agree ought now to be independent countries. Do we not confuse with a Bolshevist attack from Russia spontaneous Bolshevist manifestations in the country itself ? There are Esthonian Bolshevists, there are Lithuanian Bolshevists. They might invite assistance from Russian Bolshevists, but are we to interfere to bolster up a non-Bolshevist Govern-nient when the country shows decided Bolshevist tendencies of its own ? Is that our mission? Is that our duty? Ought we to do it at the risk of grave political consequences? You have said again and again that Bolshevism often springs from land hunger. Are we going to assist anti-Bolshevism in order to leave land hunger unsatisfied ?In Georgia the country is becoming increasingly Bolshevist before there is any Bolshevist intervention of any sort threatened or going on, and it is a cruel paradox from the War Office point of view that the people of whom the Georgians are most alarmed in Old Russia are Denikin and his force whom we are asked by the War Office to assist. It is the anti-Bolshevist and not the Bolshevist who wants to reconquer these countries and bring them back into the Old Russia. It is to them that we are asked to devote the lives of our men. on a volunteer basis, the money of our taxpayer, and it is those men who seem, in this instance at any rate, to be the greatest menace to one of the nascent nationalities.At this moment as I write, on the Caspian Sea, British ships, manned by British, crews, are fighting, or about to light, considerable naval actions, in which they may be in a numerical inferiority, They may meet with disaster. You may at any rate have to publish casualty lists. What on earth are you going to say to the mother who hopes for her sailor son home ? That he has lost his life against some intangible enemy, against an enemy he was not enlisted to fight against, after the armistice has been celebrated, for the benefit of the Georgians who are themselves Bolshevist? I don&apos;t understand it.If a country which you are pledged to protect asks you for soldiers to protect them when they are attacked, if you and your Allies can together find the soldiers or the money or the material, send it, provided you are convinced that the people of the country and not an autocratic Government want defending, and then send them to the country that is attacked, and not to wander all over Russia.I would confine myself to this policy, not because I am not as anxious as any-body in the world to see the end of the terrible menace of Bolshevism, but because I believe that those who want to fight it in Russia are, against their will, bringing it much nearer home.Yours ever,.The Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P. E. S. Montagu.
