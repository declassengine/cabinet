^6^bBm^o hand over to the Ministry of i/ays and Communications*\\     --iii.hi -;^.&apos;Ly 5* UOVl?A ONMBII-ITY FOR hV^tftllili-pj^^t fs the Property&apos; or[ttannto H*?jesty&apos;r Government)6e regulation of Eleotrio Power Supply appears to me to be open to grave objections, and I should think there is no doubt that the industrial rid would view it with alarm.I    The ftleetrie Power Supply Committee strongly recommended the $ointment of independent Electricity Commissioners, and this proposal ,s since been endorsed by all the interested Associations Municipal and jimpany.    The Electricity Commissioners will have   the control of alllIectrical generation for   public supply through District Electricity ards, and the classes of consumer will   comprise not only railways and amways, which are and will always be only a fraction of the whole, but dustrial works, municipalities,- miscellaneous users, and eventually ricultural interests..To fit in with constitutional praotiao it is essential that there pall be a Department acting as a &quot;Court   of Appeal&quot; to which  any is agreement between the Undertaking oontroiled by a District lectrioity Board or direotly by the Electricity Commissioners may be preferred for settlement, and the question arises as to which Department oan act best as the impartial Authority, the Board of Trade or the iinietry of Ways and Communications.To my mind the general opinion will be that while the Board of Trade $an give an unbiased judgmaut , the Ministry of Ways &amp; Communications isLisqualified by the fact that its primary function will be the betterment!)f one class of electricity consumer in whom it will have a direct    -v-;-: Lnterest.     In this connection it should be noted that Municipal Authorities, which now represent 320 Undertakings with an investment of over 56 millions and ere to continue their local distribution, would probably object strongly to anything that had the appearance   of being Ijcontrolled by railway interests,I      The Ministry of Ways and Communications may become directly or indirectly a big consumer of electricity.    As a consumer their interests will certainly clash at times with those of a generating authority and if they were mtide
responsible for electricity supply, they would be in the position of controlling the generating authority while being at the same time a consumer.   All the municipal interests and industrial works served by the generating euthority would at once have a grievanoe, or ima-gine they had, since the Ministry of Ways and Communications would bo In a position to oommand the most favoured terms for the railways. In fact the Ministry of Ways and Communications would be a purchaser and at the same time in control of the seller.   It would be a bio to arrange terms for railways^ to the possible detriment of other con-Burners1 interests in the area.   I should question whether such a plan could possibly wdrk in pr^etioe.It would certainly seem that the best interests of the State would be served by having the Electrical Authority as producer inde-pendent of the Ministry of Wa$  and Communications as user, whether direct or indirect, and for an independent and impartial body like the Board of Trade to act as the appeal authority from decisions of the Electricity Commissioners.Again there is neoessary machinery provided in the Bill whereby the Board of &apos;5?rade and the Electricity Commissioners may award the costs of Inquiries held by them at the request of consumers and otheae. In practice there are bound to be many oases in which railways will   . be a party to such Inquiry.   The Board of Trade could safely award the costs without risk of imputations of partiality.   !Phe Ministry &apos; of Ways and Communications, on the other hand, would find itself in a difficult position.Moreover, in the Electricity Bill clauses are being included empowering the electricity Commissioners to acquire water powers for -the generation of electricity.   Hore again electrical Interests may clash with those of the Ministry of Ways &amp; CommunicationaVg. in regard to the supply of water to canals.Finally, it is necessary to look ahead.   The Elootrioity Corn-mission m&amp;y eventually become a general Power Commission, questions not only of olectrioity supply but of coal disposal and carbonisation., liquid fuels and development of all sources of power, being placed in its charge.   In this event, the arguments against making the Ministry of Ways &amp; Communications tho authority would be multiplied.A.E. STANIiET.board OF TRADI&quot;.__ 13.219.
