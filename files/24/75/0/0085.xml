I circulate to the Cabinet a series of definite proposals by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for regulating the immediate practical action of the War Office in regard to the various theatres of operations in Russia. These proposals have my full concurrence, and I ask that if they are approved in principle I may be given full authority to act within their scope and limitations so far as British forces are concerned.It is becoming quite impossible to carry on week after week operations which are attended with loss of life and dissipation of resources without some definite policy, within which, however modest or rigidly restricted the policy may be, a genuine effort can be made to secure efficient and well-considered action.I recognize fully the enormous difficulties which beset the Cabinet in arriving at any decision of general policy, having regard to the divergent counsels among the Allies. But it is indispensable to have some decision which can govern and guide the employment and safeguarding of British resources and interests in the various theatres where we have commitments.W. S. C.24th February, 1919.(B19/125!   (50  2/19   H&amp;S   (5902-two
&quot;&quot;&quot;ragmument is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.0. 2/7/2301496345NOTE FOR THE CABINET ON FUTURE   MILITARYOPERATIONS&apos; IN RUSSIA.I. In view of the enormous size of the country, the destitution of the inhabitants, paucity of communications, the deplorable condition of the railways, and the military exhaustion of the Allies, the invasion and occupation of Russia at the present time is not considered to be a practical military proposition.2. It is, therefore, necessary to frame a policy for military operations which is within our powers. The primary responsibility of the Allies is to ensure the protection of the following States whose integrity has been guaranteed, namely: Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Rumania. ,The first essential is to establish definitely the boundaries of these States. Having done this, the Bolsheviks should be given peremptory orders to withdraw beyond their frontiers. If they do not do so, it is the duty of the League of Nations to enforce its will. This may entail direct military intervention and definite responsibility must be allocated for various parts of the Western Front.   The following is suggested : Finland to America.Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania to America, or failing America, to England. Poland and Rumania to France and Italy.3. As regards other fronts, I make the following proposals / (a.) Archangel and Murmansk. To be evacuated as soon as weather conditions permit, probably commencing June. This may be a difficult operation, and Generals Maynard and Ironside must be given a definite policy and orders before the thaw commences, i.e., by the end of March. A portion of the civil population, which sided with us, must be removed to safety. If necessary, reinforcements must be sent to cover the withdrawal.(b.) Siberian Front. We have never recognized the Siberian Government, nor assumed any definite responsibility, except as regards the Czechs, and the care and command for these has now been definitely taken over by the French. As, however, the continuance of the struggle on this front will ease the situation on other fronts, we should continue to supply war-like stores, but should withdraw our two battalions, substituting for them volunteer instructors, technical experts, and administrative staffs up to a total number of say 1,000-2,000. But before I could advise such substitution, we must have some real guarantee that the recent arrange-ment come to by the Allies and agreed to by all of them in regard to the Trans-Siberian Railway is fairly and squarely adopted.I make no reference to Japan as I consider this is outside my province.(c.) Denikin s forces. For the same reason given in (6) we should continue to supply warlike stores, including tanks, aeroplanes, armoured cars, guns, machine guns, clothing, &amp;c, with personnel up to a total of 1,000-2,000, all volunteers, necessary to instruct the Russians in their use, and administra-tive staffs to ensure proper distribution. We may also find it necessary to help in the re-estabhshment of railway communications, both for military and economic reasons. We should, however, make it quite clear to Denikin, as to Kolchak, that we have no intention of employing British troops on the actual fighting front, and that our military operations will be confined to covering Denikms rear and flanks by holding the country south of the Caucasus and the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.(d.) Trans-Caspia and tjs Caspian Sea. --- General Milne estimates that he can hold the Batum Tiflis Baku line and the adjoining country with two divisions. Such occupation will also give us command of the Caspian. So long as the present state of affairs lasts and so long as we continue our support of Denikin and Kolchak I think Trans-Caspia and the Caspian should be held, but I also think that one of the other Allies ought to relieve us of the task.(B19/125)   60   2/19   IT&amp;3   H902-two
4. If Kolchak and Denikin, with the great assistance here indicated, can build up really coherent fighting forces capable of movement and of offensive action, the Allies may wish later to revise the scale and description of their assistance.5. It is essential that the Allied Governments should, at the same time, issue a definite statement of policy, expressing sympathy and defining our proposals. This is necessary, both to give no colour to accusations of breach of faith and to raise the some-what susceptible moral of the Russian National Armies. The present state of uncertainty is giving a handle to Bolshevik propaganda, and is rendering the position of our military representatives one of extreme difficulty.6. Finally, I would add that unless all the Allies, and more especially America, join in common action in regard to Russia, and unless each of the Great Powers plays its appointed part, we Cannot command success, nor have we any right to expeot to see success crown our efforts.HENRY WILSON, Chief of the Imperial General Staff.2ith February, 1919.
