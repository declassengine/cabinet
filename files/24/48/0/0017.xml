C A B i    a(This Document is the Property of hfc Britannic Majesty^ Government.)iz[en, Ho ./9954WAR   CABINETMAN-POWER   AND   POOD   CONTROL. MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR WAR.As regards paragraph (1) of the Pood Controller&apos;a Memorandum of 5th April, 1918, G.T.4152, I hare already submitted to the War Cabinet in G.T.4050 the War Office replies to three Memoranda on the same subject by Sir A.Mond, Lord Rhondda and Mr. Austen Chamberlain respectively.In each of these Memoranda reduction of the Home Service ration was advocated on the ground that it was in excess of that allowed for the civil population.In the present Memorandum reduction is urged on the fresh ground that every 100,000  men obtained under the new Military Service Act will involve an increased consumption of 180 tons of Heat a week, and this will be an additional strain which the lTation&apos;3 meat resources will be unable to bear.Apart from the comparatively small amount involved, I would observe that the Pood Controller appears to have overlooked the fact that the men whom it is hoped to obtain under the new Act will unfortunately not constitute nett additions to the strength of the Army, but are intended primarily to replace wastage.I do not therefore think that the Memorandum under reply discloses any fresh arguments either for the reduction of the Hone Service ration, or for retarding the progress of the Military Service Bill until such reductions have been considered.12th April, 1918DERBY.
