NEUTRAL COUNTRIES.DISCLOSURE OF INgQBLIATIQM TO THE EiTOY.Copy of a Press jCable to the &quot;Chioago Tribune&quot; from a oorresronciin&quot;^ 5n Stockholm, date A 1 fifth April, 19I8T &quot; r---;-(Communicated for the information of.the War Cabinet by the Director of the Press Bureau^)Americans having first-hand knowledge of patience and ingenuity which Germans devote to mass of minor facts to get at one important fact are appalled at manner in which our country is daily spending thousands of francs in cable tolls t* pour into Germany!s hands extremely valuable information concerning AmericaTs war preparations.     A pile of these dispatches two foot high lies before me representing thousands of dollars and addressed to only one neutral capital although I understand the same expenditure is lavished on liadrid, Be me, The Hague, Copenhagen, and Christiania,     The nature of some of this material is such that any German officer would die before giving it out concerning his country and even a German civilian would know better than breathe it.     Among facts given is number of troops ready to embark and actual figures within a hundred thousand of number of American troops homo and abroad on active duty and training, including the statement that Dutoh vessels are to be used to transport some troops as soon as possible,     German submarine commanders certainly could not ask anything better than this.     Other dispatches give facts from which a child can deduce precisely wherein our troops are deficient in equipment and a detailed enumeration gives number of carloads and kinds of grain being shipped from certain named points including information that new and swifter methods of loading from docks are being employed instead of lighters.     This kind of information is simply valuable for Germans.     Reading it they say &quot;Well such and such being the case Ukraine and Roumania must come across \;ith so many million tons more so that our supply can keep pace with Allies prospective supply&quot;.     Some dispatches concerning shipments of troops for immediate future aro so explicit that one can almost hoar ?/ireloss orders crackling out from German Admiralty to submarine commanders to post ten more submarines along west coast of Ireland,     Certain figures on manufacture and transport of war material are almost insanely detailed and their total.as given in one dispatch must provide any alert enemy with valuable basis for calculations,     Ono dispatch contains ten figures on production at one plant including the plant&apos;8 location.
from these figures I cite fi^y-nia&amp;- thcusanoh, ^i ht-*thirty artillery wheels and twelve iircc;Ired aSles for a certain tyne of gun whose calibre is given.     A new scheme for boxing ammunition carts is also mentioned, together with the axaot; number of cubic feet gained by the scheme *    Using some of this material, all of which is intended for consumption by neutral countries, a news-paper, the &quot;Geneva Journal&quot; gives suggestive hints concerning our new aeroplanes as to rising, speed , size, number of cylinders, etc.    Many of these dispatches are valueless to the enemy because they prophesy only, but many others are nothing less than an invitation to Oemans to hurry up and make themselves stronger where America is making herself strong.     Using them as a basis, Germans can make estimates concerning necessary cubmarines, food rationing, and strengthening their fronts in vital particulars. Eow zealously and carefully they make these calculations is indicated by the fact which I learned since, that as early as January, 1917, when they believed it inevitable that we would come into the war, they began to revise their whole war programme. Under present conditions of our war publicity service for neutral newspapers, Baron Lucius in Stockholm and other German Ministers in every other neutral European capital need only glance over this material with their breakfast coffee and leave their Secretaries to make a digest.     Next day it is in the Foreign Office, Berlin. Men neutral newspapers do not use material, German agent3 hrve other ways of learning anything essential it contains, because it lies on reading tables in public reception rooms in American Legations for all visitors to see.     Of course, the purpose of these dispatches is understandable and the intention is laudable. They are supposed to stiffen neutral countries1 backs so that tuv? will not go over to Germany or surrender to German tonnage threats * But this war has passed the press asent stage and the only kind of prese agency neutrals;iake se iousiy any more ie laconic Jlail?/, official war reports from&quot;&quot;He ad quarters.     Concerning much ox the kind of thing: here described. they just call it &quot;American bluff&quot;. Some of this material need by Stockholm newspapers this week boro heads and sub-heads reading, &quot;A Niagara of figures&quot;, and, &quot;bore biggest: in the world&quot;, and was obviously used with tongue in cheek.. Cf&quot;enormous coot of this service there ;vould be nothing to say if it did good, but much of it is such blunt propaganda that it does harm by antagonizing neutral countries of pro-German tendency. Nor is much used in proportion to the vast amount cabled,     A diplomat asked me to-day, &quot;How much of this matter is printed by Swedish newspapers to you think?&quot;     I answered, &quot;Perhaps one twenty-fifth&quot;.     He said, &quot;By my estimates, hardly one fiftieth&quot;. Often, when not indiscreet, those dispatches are merely trivial. FoV example, this-morningTs batch devoted sever?.! dollars to telling waiting neutrals how a new law forbids trapping or shooting American Government carrier pigeons.     But some mornings we tell Germany things about troop transports that amount to saying, &quot;We are easting, come and get us&quot;.     Other times with our food shipment news we give her ample warning how tight she must draw the belt in order to hold out.Bennetts
