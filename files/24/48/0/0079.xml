NO355:- It is again necessary to add a note regarding the estimated number of sheep. .The net decrease shewn in the table is 98,000.The average number of fat sheep entered weekly at the 11 markets included in the Board1s Weekly Return of Market Prices during the 5 weeks ended 3rd April was IE,800, as compared v/ith 10,000 in February, 13,500 in January, 17,500 in December, and 15,500 for the year 1917.   This points to a total consumption of, say, 170,000.The number of lambs born between 4th March and 4th April would thus be about 70,000. In all probability, however, it was considerably higher, and was sufficient to produce a net increase instead of a net decrease in the total number of sheep.The decrease in the number of ewes shown in the table is probably to be accounted for by the selected parishes represent-:ing to an undue extent the districts from which migration took place during the month.The numbers of other sheep under and over one year old are complicated by tho Irregular movement of last year&apos;s lambs from the former class to the latter.Estimated Numbers of Live Stock in Scotland at 4th April 1918.
