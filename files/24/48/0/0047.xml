Copy of Minute from Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Secretary, War Cabinet, covering a letter from Professor Attolico.

Secretary,

War Cabinet.

I attach a letter received from Professor Attolico of the Italian Delegation - a most useful member of the Inter-Ally Council and of some of the ?Executives.

I suggest that it be circulated to the Departments concerned and to the Chairmen of the Executives and that, if the Cabinet agree Lord Buclomaster, Mr. Keynes and I should then hold a conference with these gentlemen to settle the policy of the British Government in the matter.

I have found Professor Attolico so helpful on the Inter-Ally Council that I attach importance to any suggestion made by him.

16th April, 1918
Qopy of ... letter from Professor Attolico to Mr.Austen Chamberlain.ITALIAN DELEGAIDIOK, Empire House, Kingsway, W.C^/2 13th April,1918Liy dear Mr. Chamber lain,Press of business and ill-health have prevented rae from writing to you earlier.I shall he very brief,The Intor-.-J.ly Council for Ifer Purchases and Finance must of course consider requirements end allocate funds according to these.On the other hand, the Allied Maritime Transport Council will do the sane, and allocate tonnage according to requirements.The basis of the work of both Committees is therefore reqiiiro-mcnts.Uows where these requirements have been ascertained and agreod upon (v/heat Executive), the matter is very simple.     Both Councils will accept them, unless there is shortage of tonnage or money. But there are many   oases in which requirements have not been ascer-tained or agreed.     Such requirements are apt to be subject to criticism in the   Councils themselves.     That such criticism should be made by the Councils is, to my mind, most undesirable, for several reasons:(a) It entails considerable loss of time;(b) Criticism and revision require technical knowledge, which the Councils do not possess;(c) The few instances ws have had of such discussions do not recommend their frequent repetition;(d) Kow that two Councils exist, finance and Tonnage, the respective appreciation of the different requirements may not be the same in the fr;o Councils, and might lead to a conflict of views.In order to avoid any such difficulties, I think it most essential that all existing international bodies (Meats &amp; Fats, Petroleum, titrates, Sugar^ Oil and Seeds, etc.) should make a point of ascertaining the respective requirements and of reaching a definite agreement regarding them.Some of these bodies avoid the task, cither because they do not regard it as their function, or because it ia rather an unpleasant one.     It,is, in fact,vvi*yunpleasant at times, but this is just the reason why it should not oe left to any superior Council. I In cases where Executives do not undertake this task because it is not within thoir province to do so, the respective Governments should immediately give them power to undertake it.There are some ooqmoditics which ere not covered by any executive, and for those the Jlllied Governments ought to hasten the formation of appropriate bodies.     The principle to this effect was approved in tho  iaris Conference of December.
I strongly urge that we should act on this.     And I foci that $olht action for this purpose is necessary on the part of tbelj Inter-Ally Council for War purchases and finance and of the Allied Maritime Transport Council.When wo shall have done this, we shall at the same time have accomplished much towards settling the question of the relation between the two Councils,.Of course, enco tho movement is started in the above directior experience and logic iray prove tho necessity of linking together, or even merging, certain of the executives.     This may be the ease as regards foodstuffs, which certainly allow   of a certain compen-sation between them.Very sincerely Yours,(Sgd*) B.ATT0LIC0.Austen Chamberlain, Esq., 9, Bgerton Place, S. :./3
