She air ami is of such recent development that &apos; iiSr^^nVen^ional law on the subject of bombardment from the air is - - - very s canty *At the St.Petersburg conference of 1868, which forbade the employment of certain arras on the ground that they caused unnecessary suffering, it was resolved to convene further meetings from time to time with a view to reconciling the advance of science in regard to armaments with the dictates of humanity.The Hague Declaration of 1899 prohibited oombatants from launching projectiles or explosives from balloons or other kinds of aerial vessels, but it was only made operative for a period of five years.     At the Hague Conference of 1907, a further declaration was drafted with the object of renewing the 1899 Declaration; but it was only signed by 27 out of the 44 Powers represented, and was ratified by none of the four Central Powers, nor indeed by any of the present belligerents except Great Britain, the United States, Portugal and Belgium.     It contains, moreover, an express provision that it shall cease to be binding when, in &amp; war between the Contracting Powers,, one of the belligerents is j,   joined by a non*Oontracting Power.     Accordingly it has no binding force in the present War.At the Hague Conference of 1907, a suggestion was made that the bombardment of undefended towna from the air should be specifically prohibited by Convention.    The Conference, however, agreed that such a course was unnecessary as aerial bombardment was already oovered by Article 25 of the 1899 Land Warfare Convention whioh prohibited the bombardment of undefended towns. But. in order to avoid any possible misconception on this point, the Conference agreed to insert in the 1907 Land Warfare Conven-tion, the words by any means whatever; and the Manual of Military Law, published in February 1914, explains (p.252, footnote) that the words underlined were introduced to make it clear that the bombardment of undefended localities by means of balloons or other similar contrivances was prohibited by the Convention,By the same Convention naval and military commanders are placed under an obligation to spare, as far as possible, hospitals and other privileged classes of buildings.As regards the rights of the civil population, it is recognised under the customary law that, if they take no part ^n the War, they ought to be exempt from deliberate attack.   On the other hand,: they are inevitably subject to certain of the risks of War, and the fact that loss of civilian life is occasioned incidentally by a bombardment does not render the bombardment itself illegal.    Moreover, the present v?ar is essentially a war of nations, and, as almost the whole population is engaged in work if Military value, it is no longer logically possible to draw the sane; distinction as in former wars between combatants and non-combatants. ;At the 1899 and 19o7 Cenferences, the delegates, in prohibiting the aerial bombardment of undefended towns, anticipated little mote than the possibility in the future of projectiles being dropped from dirigible balloons and the nodern development of aerial warfare was but vaguely anticipated.)    Consequently it is true that the bombarfeient of undefended towns from the air is forbidden V the Kftgue Convention *f 1907, it cannot be claimed bythat
that this prohibition was imposed with a full realization of modern conditions.It is also important to noto that in any case the prohibition in the 1907 Oomention only applies to towns whioh are not defended0     What ccnstit-utbs a &quot;defended&quot; town has never been determined.     The point was raised at the Hague Conference of 1907, but no definition was agreed either in regard to land or- naval bombardmentBe     In the latter case, difficulty was experienced in drawing a distinction between the defence of a coast and of a town near the coasttIn the Manual of Military Lav;., it is stated that a fortress or other fortified place may prima facie be considered to be &quot;defended&apos;1, and that it may be bombarded unless there are visible signs of surrenders     The view is also expressed that a locality which is not fortified may yet be &quot;defended&quot;, if for example, a military force is m occupation of, or marching through it; but, with some inconsistency, the bombardment of a town is not regarded as legitimate merely because it contains supplies of value to the enemy, or railway establishments, telegraphs, or bridges.     $To opinion is expressed as regards munition factories.The German General Staff on the other hand argue that the sole criterion as to the legality of a bombardment is whether the place possesses military value to the er.emy at the time; and they regard the insertion of the words i;by any means   whatever&quot; in Article 25 of the Land Warfare Convention cf 1907 as superfluous since modern history knows of hardly any case where open towns and villages within the zone of operations are not occupied by the enemy or defended.This appears to be the correct view, for, at the 1399 Conference, the word &quot;defended&quot; was substituted for the word &quot;fortified&quot; in the text of the Brussels Declaration of 1374 on the ground that the action of armies in the jield would otherwise be unduly restricted.     And when, at the 1399 Conference, the German delegate urged that the prohibition against the bombardment of &quot;defended&quot; towns must certainly not be interpreted as in any way forbidding the destruction by any means of any kind of building when military operations rendered such action necessary, this qualification was accepted by the Conference,The presngjt law was framed in contemplation of wars of movement waged between comparatively small armies, and the existence of a cordon of troops stretching from the North Sea to Switzerland and from Switzerland to the Adriatic presents an entirely new feature necessitating a modification of previous theories.In ancient days a town oould be sufficiently defended by fortified walls around its actual perimeter, but as the range of fire extended it was found necessary to push out the foriifi-cations further and further beyond the town.     Of this process Paris affords a good illustration.     Its original walls are now within the City,     The forts built in 1840 for its protection were in 1870-1 converted into magazines, while a new ring of works was constructed on a circumference of about 80 miles or at an average distance of about 8 miles from its original walls. In the present war even this form of defence has proved incffectiv against the long range of modern guns and* though the lines defending it had been pushed forward north of Soissons, German shells are to-day falling in the streets of Paris,Under modern conditions, then, it is no longer possible, except by lines drawn or operations conducted at a great distance,to
to render a town immune from bombardment.     It would, therefore, &quot;be difficult to rebut the argument, if it were advanced,  that the entire areas protected by the existing Allied linos or by the corresponding cordon of shins in the ITorth Sea are defended; in the 3ensa contemplated by the Conference.     Onoe this is admitted, it follows that ths bonbardmsnt of these areas by any means whatever;, whether by land.. sear or air, is legitimate, since no legal dnoy has ever been imposed on attacking forces to restrict bombardment to actual fortifications, and the destruction of its public and private buildings has always been regarded as a legitimate means of inducing a town to surrender.But. even though this view is accepted, the recognised usages of war must still be observed as regards the methods employed in carrying out the bombardment.To sum up, it may be stated that it is contrary to the spirit of international law deliberately to attack from the air churches, hospitals, and other privileged buildings where this can be avoided, or to destroy or kill in the pursuit of a definite military object,.The fudamental criterion of the legitimacy of belligerent operations is - Do they manifestly subserve military interests, and are they justifiable on the grounds of military necessity?*General Staff, War Office,12th April, 1918*
