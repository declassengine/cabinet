SECRET AND PRESSING.5F.P. 20.21st April, 1913;Secretary,War Cabinet.The military situation at the present time is such that the possibility of losing Dunkirk must be seriously considered, and the means by which we can reduce its value to the enemy as a naval base must be prepared.I have been in consultation with the First Sea Lord, and we have decided that the general arrangements for rendering the port useless should be in his hands.    We have also come to the conclusion that the actual order for commencing the work of demolition must be left to the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief in France^ since he alone would be in a position to decide the moment at ^nich the military situation necessitated the execution of the scheme.Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig has discussed the matter with General Foch, and the latter agrees as.to the necessity for making all preparations, and for carrying out the necessary demolitions, but inasmuch as the destruction of a French port is involved, he considers that the matter is one which is out- * side his competence, and must be decided between the respective -Governments.Although I hope that the necessity may never arise, I trust that the Governments will agree as to the necessity for facing the possibility, and for having a clear agreement with the French Government to meet it.
I may add that in the opinion of the Admiralty the presenoe of hostile surface craft and submarines at Dunkirk would render cross-channel communication so difficult as seriously to embarrass the position of the British Armies in France.What is required, thereforo, is that the French Government may be asked to authorise Field Marshal Sir.-Douglas Haig to carry out the necessary demolitions at his discretion if and when tho emergency arises.The matter is one of urgency, and I trust that the War Cabinet will at once give it consideration.(sd)* Henry Wilscn*General Staff,War Officea S.W.I.21st April. 1918.
