Board of Agriculture and Pisheries.i lj  6$!cp^      Report for the week ended 9 th April * 1918.Pig Production.A large amount of correspondence has been dealt with.    llany interviews have taken place &quot;between the Director      his Executive fCt Officer and offioers of various Departments and members      the public with reference to the schemes whioh have been put forward for consideration and the complaints w&amp;ioh are being made as to difficulties in obtaining food.Land Division.Small Holding Colonies.Holbeach.     Very fair progress continues to be made with the different field operations, and the drilling of the  lax and the. planting of the late potatoes having been completed, it is possible to make a start with the second early variety.    Six cottages are now ready and will be occupied this month by the settlers.     One settler, age 53, however, finds the work too strenuous, and has left the Colony.Patrington.    Appreciable progress has been made with harrowing and rolling wheat, threshing, ploughing fallows, and general farm work.    The sale of crops, produce, and stock during the week included 95 qrs. oats, 7 cwts. potatoes, 2 pigs, 4 head of poultry, and 1,413 eggs.Heath H^.11.    With a view to improving the acute labour difficulties on this Colony, pending the arrival of the settlers, it is hoped to arrange with the TCar Offioe for the establishment of a camp of some 20 to 25 prisoners, under oanvas, in order to assist in carrying out the neoessary farm work on the Colony.    If this proposal matures, it is expected that the arrears of farm work will be overtaken.Flax Production, Branch.The sowing of the crop is now general in the Southern and Midland counties.     The release of the factory premises selected for the Peterborough area has not been graftted by the Ministry of Munitions by whom they are at present being occupied.     Since these premises are unique in the specific advantages they offer for a flax factory, not only on account of the suitability of the buildings, railway sidings and surrounding land for drying, but more especially in that there are existing ponds of water immediately adjacent sufficient to ret the whole 3,000 acres of flax grown in the district, it is deeply to be regretted that the Ministry of Munitions cannot see their way to utilise some other building for their requirements.     It will consequently be necessary for the Branch to build at least 3 factories in this district in connection with which artificial retting tanks will have to be erected.The surplus seed grown by English growers has now been collected and tested, and all suitable lots cleaned and consigned to Ireland to relieve the shortage in that country.
Tithe, Commona, Copyhold and Survey Branch.During the past week three applications for Redemption, seven for Altered Apportionment, and one for the.Merger of Tithe Rent charge, three for the En f ran chi serpent of Copyhold Lands, one for an Exchange under the Inclosure Acts and one for the Regulation of a Common under the Inclosure Act, 1876, have &quot;been received. Progress has &quot;been made with many other transactions which were already in hand, and five Mergers, six Redemptions, and three Enfranchisements of Cop5rhold have &quot;been completed.     The Board continue to receive representations to the effect that the provisions of the Tithe Acts as regards the variation of the value of tithe rentcharge, and as regards the conditions under which Redemption may be carried out, should be amended.     Among the arguments advanced in favour of the conversion of tithe rentcharge into a fixed rentcharge was one to the effect that the result of the annual variation is to transfer from year to year a value from the land to the tithe rentcharge, or vice^jrej^sa, and thus to add to the difficulties of assessing&quot;&quot;^he rateable values of the land and the tithe rentcharge, respectively.     Among the miscellaneous work undertaken has been the preparation for the Pood Production Department of a nap shoving a proposed drainage district comprising the River Stour and its tributaries [Essex and Suffolk], for local deposit under the Land Drainage Aot, 1861.     The map and index Embraced forty ordnance sheets.Ordnance Survey.During the week ending 10th April, 122,026 maps were sent to Prance and 11,561 to the Admiralty. 26 relief models were sent to Prance.Commercial Control Branch.The work of the Branch during the week, in addition to enquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war and as to cases of alleged poisoning of stock by the use of rape cake, has consisted principally of correspondence as to railway facilities for oil drums and agricultural and dairy machinery and on railway rates for empty churns, the approval of names for margarine and correspondence on matters arising in connection with the Sale of Pood and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets dealt with was 3,869, in response to which 10,893 copies of leaflets were despatched.     In addition 51,900 copies of leaflets were - despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution. Applications were received for 690 copies of the three bound volumes of leaflets, and 1,136 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to Manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out.     The usual enquiries bearing directly and indirectly on agricultural publications have been received and dealt with by the Branch.Fisheries Division.Several Orders affecting fishing operations are approaching completion.     One relaxing the prohibition of motor trawling in Cumberland waters has been sent to the Local Fisheries Committee for their observations.     An Order giving effect to certain recommenda-tions of the Freshwater Fish Committee will, it is hoped, be issued on the 12th inst.     The Division are busily engaged in facilitating
fishing operations either by negotiations with private owners or with Local Fishery Authorities and also &quot;by obtaining permits for material and plant.     They are also endeavouring to arrange to make preparations for dealing with gluts of fish anticipated at the forthcoming herring fishing off Shields.Freshwater Fish Committee.Ureat activity has prevailed this v/eek in taking orders forand issuing circulars about the Collection and Distribution of Elvers.This work is now in full swing.     The arrangements for advancing moneyand otherwise assisting in the construction of eel traps in variouslocalities have been completed.     negotiations for several of theseare under way.    A scheme for the Nationalisation of some of ourcoastal waters for the purpose of creating a National &quot; el fisherytherein has been submitted by the Committee and is now underconsideration.Motor Loan Committee.     The trials of a St. Ives fishing-boat with twin-screw installation were successfully run this week.     The uther installations at this port are approaching completion.     At Shoreham the Committee have been able to keep two or three shipwrights fairly regularly employed under the supervision of one of their mechanics in doing the neoessary woodwork preliminary to the installation of engines.    This work is likely to oontinue for some weeks.     The needs of the present time, or possibly the profits to be made by fishing, are bringing into use a considerable number of boats equipped with petrol-driven engines.     A few years back these boats would have been too costly in use to be profitable for fishing and were probably used for pleasure purposes.     They are now asking for large quantities of petrol, far in excess of the allowances sufficient for the majority of professional fishermen.The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines indicated12th April, i$ae.Secretary.
