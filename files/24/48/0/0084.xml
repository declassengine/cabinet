SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION.

April 1?-18, 1918.

?1. ?. German agents are systematically buying British and American Bank Notes at a premium in Holland, Switzerland and Scandinavia. It is believed that the Germans require the notes for financing their purchases in South Russia. The peasants of the Ukraine refuse to accept Russian, Austrian or German currency. It is also possible that the Germans require British and American currency for paying their secret agents.

?2. NORWAY. The Norwegian Government continue to raise further points for discussion at Washington in their draft Agreement with the United States. Sir M. Findlay is informed that they definitely intend to defer signing the Agreement until the result is known of the German offensive on the Western front.

?3. SWEDEN. It is reported that the Swedish Government have sounded the German Government on the possibility of obtaining cereals from the Central Empires and that they have been unable to obtain any promise of supplies. Mr. Wallenberg suggests that we should allow 100,000 tons of Swedish shipping to proceed to the Plate to load the grain which will become due to Sweden when the Swedish Government have signed the General Agreement with the Allies. H.M. Government are disposed to agree to this proposal. We should in return require these or other Swedish ships to carry coal outward either from the United Kingdom or the United States.

H.M. Government have further considered a proposal, noted last week, for requisitioning the Swedish shipping in Allied ports. There are 100,000 tons deadweight of shipping time-chartered to the Allies under the Provisional Shipping Agreement. There are 240,000 tons of Swedish shipping overseas, most of which is already trading in Allied interests. There are another 150,000 tons of
p..Swedish shipping In United  ingfl oia ports or employed in Anglo-Swedish services.    The total tonnage available for requisition-ing would thus be 490,000 tone, but of thie at leant 70,000 tone would probably escape into Koutral ports.   Under the proposedShipping Agreement with Sweden m hope to secure 500,0-00 tone of shipping, end the Germans already appear willing to authorise the cession of 400,000 tone*   It woulc&quot; eloarly bo inadvisable to re-euinition the Swedish ships except in the last resort.2^SM,2 i.*   It would appear th&amp;t the Dutch are anacioue to secure the 100,000 tons of cereals which we have pit at their disposal in tho United States and South America,        that they regret their deols-ion to regard the requisitloning of their ships by the Associated o-OVomments as a breach of relations.   Mr. London has informed the Dutch States General this wook of our offer to supply Holland with cereals and of our guarantee that no Butch ship sent to fetch them will be requisitioned;   and he declared that in his opinion tho Allied guarantee %&amp;b sufficient.   In the debate which followed tho Dutch Government was criticised for not Baking thie statement before and ftnrnnot closing with our offer.   It wag pointed out that Germany oould not reasonably object to Dutch ships leaving Holland ua&amp;er a guarantee that they would bo free to return.   If these ships were molested by the Germans, Germany would be clearly responsible for the privet lone Buffered by the Dutch people.She order, noted last wsok, to  Olmo end detain the Relief supplies in Holland was isctxod by the Dutch Cabinet in ilr. T,ou6on&apos;s absence.   vx* Doug on says the step was taken owing to a mlaunder-etanaing.   He cannot, however, guarantee that Seliof supplies arrivf] ing in Dutch ports will continue to be delivered to Belgium if the food conditions in HeXlaaa shoula become   really serious.For the present no further suppliee of raw materials for raar-garine will be sent to Holland froia the United Hinge&apos; om, since tho Dutch have bef$&amp; to retain a percent ego of these materials for
their own use,   H have always disputed this claim;   and we shall require the Butoh to make up the deficiency In their deliveries of margarine to tho United langfiom arising out of their retention of these supplies before m allow any further raw materials to go for-ward-   M ara now virtually independent of the Butch margarine manufacturers.   Ho intimation will be m&amp;de to tho II.0.?. until they ask us to explain our action.We are reliably Infer me 0* that the Government of tho &quot;Dutch East Inales have prohibited the- export of quininet cinchona bark, tin and eapoc, except uncer Government licence.M&apos;    Under the Spanish -American Gogsserelal agreement, concluded on March 7th, the Spanish Government agree to tmpply the /-llioe with unlimited quantities of pyrites, minerals an6* manufactured wool, They also agree to supply the Allies with rice, raisins, onions, olive oil. cotton, hemp and Jute manufactures, raw and narmfaeturod leather and hides, rolling stock and conveyances for transport, sub-ject to the home requirements of Spain and   the general obligations of  her foreign trade.    Tho United States undertake to supply Spsin with specific quantities of cotton, petroleum, locomotives and rail-way materials, metal msnuf&amp;eturos, chemicals, machinery, electrical material, aluminium, tobacco, and sulphate of ammonia.    A number of contracts for special supplier, urgently required by the aontrsot-ing parties will be inmediately carried out.    Bach of the contract-ing parties will find the tonnage necessary for transporting the supplies which it purchases.    Goods obtained uncer the Agreement will not be re-ex orted from the importing country without tho sanction of the government 01* the exporting country.the Franco-Spanish Commercial Agreement provides for an In-terofcange of eommoeitiee between -^ranco and Spain roughly on the lines laifi aown in the Spanish-American Agreement.   She French Gov-ernment undertake to supply Spain with unlimited quantities of copra from Madagascar, with specified quantities of phosphate of lime from Horth Africa, ana of tar, pitch and. woollen rags.      2hey aloo agree

The French Government undertake to facilitate the Spanish transit trade with Switzerland through France! and the Spanish Government undertake to facilitate the transit of sup-plies passing through Spain to or from  Yanee and the /rench Colonies.The fulfitent both of this Agreement and of the Spanish-American Agreement is dependent on the Spanish Government carrying out an agreed arrangement for financing branch purchases in Spain.   A group of Bpaftiish bankers will be authorised to open credits In favour of a Frenchpesetasgroup up to 38,000 ,000/&amp; month for 10 months.   The advances will be. guaranteed by a deposit in Spain of French Treasury bonds or of Span-Ish Securities, ropresenting at least 40$ of the value of tho current drafts.    The advances may be renewed until llaroh SOth 1920, when tho first reimbursements will be mafia.   Intoreot will be paid at a rate not exceeding        inducing brokerage and commission.   The Spanish government will, if necessary, take stops to compel Spanish firms in-terestod in the export trade with France to assist in creating these credits *      The ere-&apos; its will be used exclusively to finance the  &quot;rench purchases in Spain which are covered %$ the Franco-Spanish /igreemont.86.
