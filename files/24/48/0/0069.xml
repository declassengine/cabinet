\\    His Bi rcsnn7-KlL^]^r^ I oirculate - the report of a Sub-Comnittee appointed to give effect to the decision of the War Cabinet as to the distribution of the British Empire Medal.     The Cabinet decided that the Medal should be given in the proportion of one for every hundred workers and that the workpeople should be allowed to nominate for awards, but for the reasons given in the Sub-Committee&apos;s report it was not found possible to prooeed with a distribution on these lines, and the list of awards made at the New Year was limited to persons who had performed aots of great courage and self-sacrifice in different kinds of war service.     The Sub-Committee, having further considered the matter, now suggest that the difficulties of distributing the Medal on the basis proposed by the Cabinet could be met by (l) limiting the British Empire Medal (silver) to acts of courage or self-sacrifice or specially distinguished service, (2) issuing at the end of the war a general Medal in bronze to all persons who have rendered war service of a certain length of time and are not otherwise disqualified.I should be glad if the War Cabinet would consider these proposals.   Unless the Cabinet so desire, it is not necessary to come to a final decision now on the second of the proposals which as the Sub-Committee point out is not without some difficulties. The question might be left open for further consideration at the close of the War, and in the meantime it will be better not to make any announcement on the subject.G. CAVE.17th April, 1918.4N118
15 GREPORT of the BRITISH EMPIRE MEDAL SUB-COMMITTEE on the BASIS to be adopted for theDISTRIBUTION OF THE MEDAL.Members of Sub-Committee:-    Mr. Delevingne (Home Office);   Sir C Stewart-Wilson and Sir T, Munro (Ministry of Munitions);   Mr, R. R. Scott (Admiralty);   Earl of Kerry (War Offioe);   Sir W. Marwood (Board of Trade);   Mr. H. B. Butler (Ministry of Labour).Under the statutes of the Order, the medal may be awarded to &quot;persons, notbeing members of the five classes of the .... Order, whose services to our EmpireThe original intention of the Government was that the British Empire Medal should be instituted in order to associate the working olasses with the Order, and was to be the reward of special service, while a general medal should be given to all munition workers who had rendered approved service for not less than a certain length of time.   It was subsequently decided by the War Cabinet that the British Empire Medal should be given in the proportion of one for every hundred workers and that the workpeople should be allowed to nominate for awards.The Sub-Committee was appointed to make the arrangements to give effect to these decisions.   On the recommendation cf the Sub-Committee a preliminary notice was issued with the first list of the Order (&quot; 25th August, 1917) explaining the scope of the medal in the following termBt-&quot;The Medal of the Order of the British Empire will be awarded for services of special merit rendered to the Empire by men and women in manual and other work   done for the war.   Such services will include acts of great oourage, self-sacrifice or high example;    of initiative or perseverance;   of skill, rescuroe or invention.   It is hoped that in some industries arrangements may be made under whish weight oan be given to recommendations made by the workers them-selves of men and women most deserving to receive this Honour.   Lists will be issued from time to time&quot;.On this oooasion it was only possible to issue a short list of awards for aots of oourage and special service which had already been brought to the notice of Departments..It will be seen that the notice only alluded in general terms to the principle of selection by the workers themselves;   it was felt that in some oases, e.g. War Offioe service, and the merchant service, the nethod would be inapplicable, and considerable difficulties also were anticipated in settling the arrangements.In October the question was further considered in connection with the list for the New Year.   A circular was sent out to employers requesting them to submit names of any workers who had distinguished themselves on any of the grounds specified in the public notice quoted above and instructing them to give full consideration to any recommendations that might be put forward by workers.   The result was significant. In many shops great hostility to awards of the medal by selection was shown.   The following are some of the opinions expressed:-would warrant such   mark of Our Royal Appreciation,n
Yfe have applied to the men themselves to select representatives, which by practically uhammous voting they have deelined to do.   The majority opinion is represented by a large number of voting papers returnod to us marked &quot;To Hell with Kedals. Get oft With the War.    under these oiroumstanoes and as an expression, which we send to you with all respect, is altogether admirable, weuttiot ubv uxi hiw wits nar,      unaer xxieso circumstances ana atexpression, which we send to you with all respect. is,,altogether admirable have no alternative but to return your list unfilled,&quot;&quot;That this meeting of Shop Stewards and Representatives entirely dissociate themselves from the proposed distribution to workpeople of Medals of the British Empire Order.&quot;Our workmen have passed a resolution to the effect that they do not desire to participate in the awards, thenreason given being that the men feel that such a distinction would be invidious.&quot;&quot;We are of opinion that as all have done their best as the opportunity has been given them and ability allowed, we collcotively are not able to nominate anv particular person or persons for the honour in question, and to make a distinction as to the degree of merit as to the services rendered would only result in bad feeling and jealousy, whioh does not now exist.&quot;   (Extract from a letter reoeivod from the Secretary of the Faotory Works Committee.)Employers in many cases took the same view, and refused to make any recommenda-tions on the ground that it was impossible to select certain workers without doing injustice to many others and causing great heart-burnings.   Only a very small pro-portion replied at all.On further consideration of the matter, and after consultation with the &apos; Ministry of Labour who wore strongly of opinion that in the ciroumstanoes it would be advisable to defer a general list of awards, it was decided to confine the January list to acts of courage and self-sacrifice, and after its issue to consider further the question of tho basis to be adopted for the distribution of the medal. In view of the attitude taken both by employers and by workers, it would in any case have been impossible to prepare a general list in time for the New Year.A list of nearly 400 persons (of whom over 100 were women) who had performed acts of great courage or self-sacrifice in many different kinds of war service was accordingly prepared and approved.   The list, whioh was issued with a brief descrip-tion in eaoh case of the act for which the medal was given and appeared a day or two.later than the list of awards of the Order, attraoted a good deal of attention and was very favourably oonmented on in the press.   No criticism of the faot that it was limited to special aots of this kind has reached the Home Office and the limita-tion has certainly tended to enhance the value of the medal in public estimation.It seems necessary now, if possible, to arrive at some definite conclusions on the question of future distributions of the medal.   A certain number of the employers who were asked to submit recommendations on the wider basis and sent in lists are anxious to know what is going to be done.   Further, if the idea of a general distri-bution on a one per cent, basis is still to bo retained, it would be undesirable to postpone putting it into offoct until aftor several lists had been issued on the present restricted basis, as the subsequent extension would be regarded as lowering the status of the decoration.The question cannot, it is suggested, be considered apart from the question oftho issue of a general &quot;war&quot; medal to all munition workers.   The Committee presidedover by Sir G, Tounger, to which this question was referred, has just presented areport to tho Minister of Munitions submitting the following resolution:-&quot;The Committee are of opinion that, while, if possible, it would be, desirable to fulfil Lord Kitohener&apos;s pledge* to grant medals to munition workers who have*Lord Kitchener*s pledge ran as follows:- &quot;I am glad to bo able to state that His liaioatv has approved that where service in this great work of supplying munitions of war has been thoroughly, loyally and continuously rendered, the award of a modal will be granted on tho successful termination of the war.
to recommend a scheme which would necessitate either the ............. ux ,,,,,,,machinery by the employers or labour or by the State, or the addition, by any sub-stantial degree, to the work of the staffs already in existence. &apos; uAfter^oareful consideration of the. evidence laid beforeandAlter carenu consideration of the evidence laid before them, they feel that no award of medals to munition workers based upon standards of &quot;thorough, 1oral a continuous   work can therefore be reoommended. *o 4x4Tte^ wouldi however, draw attention to the award of Medals of the Order of the British Empire to munition workers, a list of which appeared in the *Timesf of January 8tn, 1918,   Those awards are limited to aots or bravery and gallantry whioh can justly be assessed without serious trouble.   The Committee oonsider that Lord Kitchener s Pledge would, under these ciroumstanoes, be adequately fulfilled by His Hajesty continuing to,make awards, to, munition workers *i grounds limited in this employers ofSlaSour0^   Growing the burden of additional work upon the State or theWo agree with the conclusion of the Committee that a distribution of medals according to a Btandard based on the oharaoter of the servioe rendered is in the ciroum-stanoes impossible.   At the same time   we do not think that a distribution of the British Empire Medal for aots of oourage and self-saerifioe will satisfy Lord Kitohener&apos;s pledge.   The pledge applies to all munition workers whc have rendered thorough, loyal and continuous servioe, without any limitation, and was given in the King&apos;8 name.   Even a one per cent, distribution of the British Empire Medal could not be regarded as fulfilling it.It seems certain that the Government will be expected to honour that pledge. Moreover, in the early days of the war, certificates were iBsued by the War Offioe to workers in oertain of the munition firms which contained a definite promise of the medal-We suggest a solution of the difficulties both as regards the British Empire Medal and as regards Lord Kitchener&apos;s pledge on the following lines:-1. Limit the British Empire Medal (silver) to aots of courage or self-saorifioe, or specially distinguished servioo,2. Issue at the end of the war a general medal in bronze (of similar design perhaps to the British Empire Medal) to all persons who have renderod war service for a certain length of time and are not disqualified to reoeive -*-he honour from His Majesty by reason of any proved misconduct in connection with their work,ThiB scheme would get over the objeotion taken by the workers to the one per oent. distribution of the British Empire Medal for good servioe - and the aots of oourage and self-saorifioo in connection with war service of all kinds are so numerous that there fieed be no fear that the awards of the medal will seem unduly few as aompared with awards of the OrdersA general war medal for all persons who have rendered war service is an extension of Lord Kitchener&apos;s pledge.   This seems inevitable.   The pledge was given in the early days of the war before the immense extension of the munitions industries had begun. Individual inquiry into the records of the workers is now impossible.   The only prao-tioable soheme is to give a medal to all persons who have served for a oertain length of time (say one or two years) just as a oampaign medal will be given to every soldier in the Army.The soheme is not without some difficulties, but they do not seem insuperable. It will be necessary for one thing to define what is to be regarded sb war service for the purposes of the general medal.   Is it to be limited (as in Lord Kitohener*s pledge) to the production of munitions of war?   There are many other formB of work whioh have been essential to the proseoution of the war, suoh as the manufacture of clothing, f*od and other supplies for the Army and Navy, transport by sea and land, the work of the thousands of sub-oontraotors engaged in making parts for the munitions works, themunitions tine short-
production of food, &amp;c, &amp;c.     In many oases the persons engaged in these occupations have been called upon to make great exertions and it is not easy to find a reason for distinguishing between them and the munition workers who may have worked no harder and have probably been much better paid for their work.   On the other hand, to include these other forms of service would create great diffi-culties - the industries have been engaged in civilian work as vrell as war work -and it would practically be impossible to decide which of the persons engaged in these industries were entitled to medals and whioh were not.   The Sub-Committee think it will probably be found that the only possible course is to limit the medal to the production of munitions of war in the narrower sense, and to take as the basis for the distribution the works on the Ministry of Munitions&apos; and Admiralty Lists,   The difficulty of determining what is to be regarded as war service would of course have arisen equally in oonneotion with the proposed one per cent, distri-bution of the British Empire Medal.Secondly, there will be numerous cases of workers who have had to give up work before the end of the war by reason of ill-health, &amp;c, and will be no longer on the employers   books, and of workers who have removed from one faotory to another.   To trace these would entail an enormous amount of work and would in many cases be impossible.   It would probably be neoessary to distribute the. medal in the first instance to those on the employers&apos; books at the end of the war who had served for the prescribed length of time;   it would not give the employers any serious trouble to prepare and furnish lists of these workers.   It would be left to those not included in these lists who were entitled to the medal to put forward a claim - the claim would have to be made on a prescribed form (to be obtained from the Post Offioe) and would give certain particulars as to servioe:   it would be referred to the employers for verification.   The work of dealing with these appli-oations would no doubt be considerable, but would be in the main olerical.   Possibly the National Servioe Organization oould be utilized for the purpose.The general medal might also be given to the relatives of those workers who have lost their lives while engaged in war service, o.g. in a faotory explosion, through T.N.T. poisoning or otherwise.The number of medals required would depend on what kinds of service would be treated as war service.    On the narrower basis suggested, it may be nearly four millions, but on the basis of including all forms of work essential to the proseoution of the war, the number would probably reaoh or exoeed six millions.The soheme would not entail any labour on employers or the Departments con-cerned during the war.It may be found convenient to utilize the general medal for reoognising other kinds of work (not of an industrial kind) in oonneotion with the war, espeo-ially voluntary servioe such as Red Cross work, which under the original soheme of the British Empire Medal would have been eligible for that medal.M.
