SECRET.the, coytROL gy labour sumv.2/351.The propose of the Minister of National Service in his paper Oitf30d4 is     eonsiderafcla interest to the Army Council in that it has fe/y direct &quot;beting on the plans for demobilisation of the Array and resettlement of officers and man in Civil Life,Prom the beginning of the formation of these plans, the W&amp;r Off!Of have verged in tne most Intimate eg*eper&amp;tion with the mnistry of Labour, in order that the demobilisation of the Military forces shall aeoajrd with the plans adopted for resettlement and vice versa.   For many months the two Departments have been working together through a series of Committees, and, in addition, have held a very large number Of official and semi-official conferences. and in the rehearsals of demobilisation that hate taken plate Employment department officials have worked side fcy side with Bar fffioc officials.   Here than these two Departments have eoitrisuted to the scheme for it covers not only Military Demobilisation and Civil Resettlement, hut also re*education and training.   Thus the Ministry of Pensions and the Board of Education have collaborated with the v/ar Office and the Hinistry of Labour.   The Army Council consider that to uproot from one of these Departments the functions which have been allotted to it by mutual agreement would be fraught with considerable danger to the elaborate and -by reason of its complexity - delicate organisation.   The adoption of the proposal of the Minister of National Serviee will therefore almost certainly involve considerable duplication of work, and will mean going over much ground that has already been traversed.    From the point of view of the work of preparing for demobilisation, therefore, the Council are opposed to the proposed transfer of functions.A further objection to the transfer proposed is that tne War Office has to work out a Scheme of fle-mobilisation, which may have to be put into effeot during the progress of, or shortly after completion of, demobilisation.    The Ministry of National Service will then have ceased to function, and the War Office will have to change its civilian partner in the complex work of demobilisation acd mobilisation $ust at the moment of greatest possibility of confusion and dislocation.(Sgd.)
