12th April.   1918.&apos;ANTI-SUBMARIN3 COASTAL PATROLS BY AEEOPLAKSS._____________Admiralty Memorandum for the War CabinetrIt will be remembered that it was stated in- the Admiralty Memorandum dated the 15th ultimo (G.T. 3944) that the Report of Captain L. Pierron with reference to the Organisation in France of Anti-submarine Coastal Patrols by Aeroplane did not appear to displose any new method of antisubmarine warfare and that aeroplanes have fcr some time been used by the Admiralty for anti-submarine work.      It is desired that the War Cabinet should be informed cf the position in regard tc the mere rapid development of this policy.I had understood   in conversation -tfith Lord Rothermere and Mr Churchill $ that we could probably be supplied, in the next six months, with from o\000 to 4,000 aeroplanes for coastal patrol work, but I have since beer, informed that, although a large number of machines :?ere thought to be available, a considerable number cf them were found to have no engines and a further number turned out tc be useless for this particular work.The Admiralty are most anxious tc arrange for each coastal area to have available a sufficient&quot; number cf aeroplanes to maintain a constant patrol overa  belt of 15 to 20 miles from the coast, outside which in the first instance float-seaplanes and ultimately Large Americas or suitable boat-type searlanes would be working, vith hydrophones, in conjunction with fast surface craft for submarine hunting purposes, and also carrying out long-distance reconnaissances or extended operations.    Air ships of the smaller type-would be employed in meeting and escorting convoys through each area and passing them on to escorting airships from the next area, the personal escort cf convoys being carried out by kite balloons in addition. Further, each area should have in hand a bombing force or hunting squadron of aeroplanes ready to leave instantly to hunt any submarines which may be sighted or located.Although aeroplanes are suited,   fcr this patrol work within a distance of about 15 miles from the coast, it is essential, fcr the present at any rate, that seaplanes and net aeroplanes should be used beyond that distance.    The Air Ministry have accordingly been informed that it Is necessary that a supply cf the existing type of float-seaplanes shouldbe/
-be continued until an adequate supply cf Larse Americas, and the necessary facilities for using them  are available, after which there will probably be nc further requirements for float-seaplanes except to supply some of the elder Seaplane Carriers which can only carry this type cf machine.With regard to the prevision cf aeroplanes, the Air Ministry &quot;have so far supplied the Admiralty with 3 Flights of aeroplanes, 18 machines in all, which are now in&quot;use for anti-submarine work and are stationed on the East Coast,    A   further 27 Flights of D.H.6!s have also been offered and accepted but, owing to their small engine power, it is not possible to use these particular machines more than 5 miles from the coast;  moreover they are incapable of carrying an observer as well as bombs,    Notwithstanding this, however, the Admiralty will be only toe glad to make use of these additional Flights, as the mere fact of their flying ever the sea will tend to keep the submarines down and they will enable a patrol to be established on the East and South Coasts of Great Britain, It is understood that 7 cf these Flights will be available this month and that the supply will be com-pleted in June,I desire, however, to make it clear that the Admiralty are most amcious to obtain all the suitable aeroplanes that can be supplied and would make immediate use of them, as the necessary aerodromes are available so far as the East and South Coasts are concerned, while as regards the Coasts of the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea, aerodrome sites are being selected and all necessary steps taken to enable the aeroplane coast patrol to be developed as fast as the necessary machines and personnel are supplied,Proposals have been forwarded to the Air Ministry fcr constructing a suitable type of anti-submarine patrol aeroplane.(Sgd.)
