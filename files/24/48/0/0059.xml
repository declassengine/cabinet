-LUli? Document is fhAty orSECRET,17th April 1918.q^^V&apos; * \     tee situation at archangel. &quot;&apos;--^     Admiralty Memorandum for tho War Cabinet.1.-    Equally with the situation at rtemansk described in Admiralty Memorandum of the 16th instant, the situation at Archangel requires consideratiiui-lay^the War Cabinet.   The position as regards Archangel is not so complex as that at Murmansk, as it is not at present complicated by any Finnish or German activities.2.-    The Allied interests there are chiefly connected with the dmsire to retain our trade relations with the district and the difficult question of safeguarding tho valuable war stores lying at the port.3.-    Some 212,000 tons of valuable stores and metals were bought (on credit) by the Russians for the use of Russian industries and for war purposes? and, ever since Russia ceased to be an Ally, the question of either getting these stores back, of destroying them, or at least of preventing them falling into German hands, has been under consideration.4.-    Had Archangel been ice-free, the question would have been simple, but tho impossibility of sending men-of-war through the ice has rendered the matter extremely difficult.5.- Armed occupation of Archangel was considered by the Allied Naval Council and the Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council at Versailles on 23rd March 1918, and it was then decided that under existing conditions no military resources whatever were available for an expedi-tion to Archangel, while from the Naval point of view, it would be extremely difficult to withdraw naval material to devote to this work.6.-    Consequently, as the Allies were not prepared to use force, same other scheme had to be adopted.7.-    Endeavours are now being made to induce the Russian Authorities to barter these stores for food and clothing of which it is known the inhabitants of. the district arein need.With this end in view, two food ships, accompanied only by the British armed ice-breaker &quot;Alexander&quot;, are being despatched from i&amp;rmansk&apos;to Archangel on Wednesday 17th April.The British Consul at Archangel has opened negotiations with the local authorities with a view to exchanging the war stores for food and clothing.Monsieur Trotsky has also teen approached and offered supplies through Archangel if he will stop the stores being railed away,8.-    It is considered that once the food ships arrive at Archangel, supported by sufficient force to prevent thembeing
-2-being seized by the Russians, there will be a better chance of successful negotiation, or at any rate of delaying the railing away of the stores, until free navigation gives us an opportunity of taking wider action if desired.9.-    Navigation will be free about the third week in May and men-of-war with a draught up to 22.feet will be able to proceed right up to the town of Archangel,   Consequently it becomes urgently necessary to consider what is to be done,10.-    &quot; Prom many points of view the armed occupation of Archangel is, extremely necessary to prevent the raU^lEg away of the stores and to give the Allies another foothold in Russia, but however desirable this may be, it is understood that, in the opinion of the Military authorities, the mere occupation of Archangel would not be sufficient without obtaining control of the railway from Archangel to Vologda. Owing to food difficulties, the evacuation of the population in the Archangel district might also be entailed.Were this policy adopted against the vti.shes of the Bolshevik Government, we might find ourselves compelled to send a comparatively large expeditionary force to hold our own against guerilla bands of Red Guards.With the assent of the Bolshevik Government, a comparatively small number of troops would be required, asit seems probable that the Red Guards will prevent the Germans reaching this part of Rassia at any rate for some time to come.If, however, Allied intervention from the East was brought about, the occupation of Archangel, the evacuation of the population, and the destruction of the rai. lway leading to Vologda, would not present any great difficulties.11,-    The Admiralty propose to send a cruiser to Archangel as soon as the navigation is open to protect Allied interests.There may be trouble in Russia over this as in the case of the landing of seamen at Vladivostok, and the position of the Captain will be very difficult.Everything in Russia appears to hinge on whether the Bolshevik Government will invite the Military assistance of the Allies , and whether this assistance will be forthcoming.Until this has been decided, it seems impossible to treat the situati on at Archangel separately from the main question of our policy generally in Russia.The Admiralty desire the approval of the War Cabinet to the despatch of a cruiser as proposed and a definite ruling on the following points which will arise on the arrival of the ship at Archangel:(a) Is the Captain to prevent by force (if he can) the railing away of the stores from Archangel ?(b) Is the Captain to be given wide discretionary powers to deal with any situation that may suddenly arise without previous reference to the Admiralty if time does not admit ?(Sgd)   R.E.
