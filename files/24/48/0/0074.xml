(Appendix).GENERAL NASH supplemented the Memorandum by verbal explanations in some detail with reference to a map.   He laid great stress on the necessity of diverting the whole of the coal traffic from the French railways still available from the North to the South.   He explained certain railway developments that are being commenced, but pointed out that these could not take effect for. many months to come, and depended entirely on the development of the military situation.     He said that the Bruay system of coal mines was almost entirely under shell fire.   At present only three of the mines were actually out of operation, but the enemy, by concentrating his fire, could gradually put the whole lot out of action. Even if the mines were not put out of action, he could put the railways under fire and stop the traffic. There were considerable stocks of coal amounting to 2^0,000 tons accumulated at the pit-heads, but it was difficult to remove so large a quantity.  The French had endeavoured to utilise the canal system tc remove the coal- but the enemy had concentrated his fire and sunk two barges, which had blocked the traffic. Now the canal was being interrupted from the other end, c-^ins to
-2-certain inundations that ware &quot;being put in operation fox da purposes, at pre.oent, he--said., the ^taff weTe Jiainp^red at every turn, in regard to the strategic use of tne rsilways their knowledge that the civilian traffic on them was vital -TLr economic life of France, OGEREEAI 711301? said that we ought to base our plans on two assumptions;-(1)   That the whole of the output of the Bruay mines was liable to cease;(2)   That more and more French divisions might be sent to the Ilorth involving greater strain on the railway:THE PHILS Hi;TIiTEH pointed out that there were two assumptions to consider:-(1)   That some of the mines, might be put of action: even in this case it would be necessary to divert the traffic from the railways to shipping:(2)   That the mines were lost altogether:He was Qf opinion that we ought at once tfl face the second contingency.GENERAL IEAVEES 0LAEK2 said that some 5,000 to 10,000 men from the Bruay mines were now being utilised to dig defences. Some of the miners had been removed by the French Government to the South of France to work in the coal mines in that area.GEITERAL NASH stated he was informed by M. Loucheur that ih system of mining in the South was quite differei . from that in the ilorth of ihance, with the result th-t the output per man would not be so l^rge in the case of miners transferred to the South.   GEIJERAI: HASH ?lse pointed out that if the coal traffic from tho Bruay mines to the South of franco v:;re entirely stopp it would not be neceseery to make up from EnaI^ni the whole of the 600,000 tons, the figure given .*.s minimum requirements by French.   A considerable proportion of the 600,000 tons were use ff*r making- gas, and for this purpose the coal from the Durham mine fields had a much higher capacity than coal from the Bruay fields.   He pressed very strongly that the ?i ime Ilinister^ proposal to stop the traffic entirely and to assume, for the ti:.:e being at any rate, that no further coal could be obtained from the Bruay mine fields, should be adopted.THE PRIME Ivir-isra said that the case for stopping the coa traffic appeared to be overwhelming.   It would confer the following two advantages:-(1)   A very great increase in the capacity of the rail wo ys for strategics! purposes:(2)    It would sot free a number of minors for labour        j purposes:SIR JOSEPH HAsJLAY said that, at tho present time, the J difficulty of carrying out this proposal was due rsther to Iscl of coal than ships. Ships were now being turned round quicker, and the convoy system was working well. Even if the coal were I forthcoming, however, it would not be possible for him to carrj 600,000 tons a month Jrom England to the South of France, altnfll he Bright be able to manage 300,000.&apos; Having regard to the sunal qualities of the Durham coal, he was inclined to agree with E General Hash that this would go a loiu way to meet the es,entil French requirements.
The great difficulty, however, was that sufficient coal was not forthcoming from our own pita.     He had already seen the Coal Controller on the matter to-day, and had arranged to see him again at 6,30 p.m.    The diffioulty was due partly to the faot that the raising of coal at the pits was insufficient, and partly to the difficulty of transporting it to the ports.     This latter difficulty, he &quot;believed, would involve a reconsideration of the whole of the railway traffic of the country.    Another diffioulty whioh would arise was the supply of ooal to Italy.    This month we should be sending something over 600,000 tons of ooal, and Italy would be very well supplied.    Part of this, however, came from France, and as in this emergency, Franoe would probably keep her ooal for herself, the Italian position would become extremely acute.    He would be in a better position to state what could be done after his conference to-night with the Coal Controller.TES PRIMS MIKISTSR, on behalf of the War Cabinet, decided that:-It was of vital military importance to stop the transport of coal from the Bruay mines to the South of Franoe, and that the only aa^e- assumption on vhich to base our plans was that no coal would be forthcoming from the Bruay area. The Coal Controller and the Shipping Sontroller, in concert, should do their utmost to supply and transport the minimum amount of coal required by the French South of the Somae.FOGS FOR THE CIVILIAN POPvLATIOtf OF THE I.ORTH OF FRA2JCS.OTERAL TRACERS CLARKE elaborated the information given in the Memorandum in regard to the feeding of the civil population of Hortn France.    The question, he /pointed out, really was mainly one of tonnage, but the amount of tonnage required was a small matter compared with the transport of ooal, and would not amount to more than 15,000 tons a month.TSS PRIME MINISTER asked if it would not be possible to evacuate the civil population?GEBKRAL W1LSUH said that this was proceeding to a considerable extent already.SSHERAL TRAVER3 CLARKE said that he understood Lord Milner tjss seeing Monsieur Clemenoeau about this question to-day.SIB .10S2PH MAC LAY said there would be no diffioulty in supply-ing the necessary amount of shipping.SHB SHIMS MIKISTSR, on behalf of the War Cabinet, decided that;-Subject to Lord ftilner not having already arranged the matter the War Cabinet would approach the Prenoh Oovern-ment with a view to releasing the Southern lines of railway by placing the necessary foodstuffs for cifilian purposes in the area Horth of the Somme by sea.
THE PROVISIONS OF FOODSTUFFS FOR FRENCH TROOPS OPERATING IN THE NORTHERN AREA.

GENERAL TRAVERS CLARKE said that the French Military Authorities had asked if the British Military Authorities would be prepared to feed the French Armies, operating with British troops. North of the Somme. There were certain difficulties, in the way of this proposals The general principle on which we had always acted had been that each nation is responsible for the maintenance of its own troops, and all demands were assessed accordingly. The French system of supplying their troops from the depots was different from ours. He, however, would be prepared to supply the French troops if the Quartermaster-General could forward him the necessary supplies. This of course would not release the French of the necessity of providing the necessary road transport, both motor transport and horses. At present the quantity required was not very large, but if the French Army in the North went on increasing, the quantities would be considerable. Moreover, the Belgians were now asking for assistance, as the French had not been able to supply them. His own principal function in connection with foodstuffs was to feed the British Army, and he had pointed out to the Field Marshal that the splendid defence put up by the British Army in the recent fighting had been largely due to the fact that ample food had always been forthcoming.

GENERAL COWANS said that he could supply the quantity required, provided the Shipping Controller could ship it.

SIR JOSEPH MACLAY said that the necessary shipping could be made available.

GENERAL NASH laid the utmost stress on our feeding the French troops, if possible. One train a day would feed 2 divisions, but the French force night reach a size requiring 10 trains a day. The railways would be strained to their utmost capacity to supply the ?tion and ordinance stores for this force, and it would be a great relief if the food could be obtained from British sources of supply.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that we ought to provide every inducement to the Fronah to send reinforcements to assist our Army. We should try and meet them in every way. Moreover, a relief which might amount to as much as 10 trains a day would be very substantial.

THE PRIME MINISTER, on behalf of the War Cabinet, decided that:-

The provision of foodstuffs for all troops operating North of the line ETAPLES-ST. POL, should be undertaken by the British Army.

It was arranged that GENERAL TRAVERS CLARKE and GENERAL NASH should remain in London until Lord Milner&apos;s return.

April 18, 1918.
Memoraadtaa by Lieut.-Sen, gravers B*Clarkov0.B.With reference to the memorandum submitted to the Cabinet on tho 4th April, 1918, asking for certain decisions should the rail communications between the Northern and Southern Lines of Communications in France be denied to us, a situation has now arisen which calls for immediate action.The railway lines from the South, which effect junction at SAltBUX, are between this station and that of ST.ROCB exposed to hostile shell fire and the line is so constantly out as to render its use so limited as to be negligible.    Hence, traffic can only pass Northwards via the ROMBSCAJ ?S-IU 1U-ABBSVILLB and: SAHACHES-LONGPHE lines, the latter being a single line only. The total capacity of this system is not more than 90 marches each way*It is clear that the whole of these marches will not be sufficient tor the military needs of the Allied Armies operating North and immediately South of the SOMUB, yet at present a considerable portion of the available marches is taken up by economic traffic - mainly coal from the BRUA.Y Mines.    To enable us in conjunction with-tho French Military Authorities to utilise ell the carrying capacity of this restricted railway system, it is essential that all civil traffic be compelled to cease forthwith.    With the exception of coal the civil traffic is, however, negligible except in so far as the evacuation of refugees is concerned.The  revision of the necessary coal Zrom forthe use of the Prench is hence of paramount impcctsace and it must now be decided whether shipping can be arranged for this servioe.    The Eronch authorities estimate that there will bo a nett shortage of coal South of the SOMMB of 600,000 tens per month.2. The coast lateral line gorth of the SOMME mustequally be relieved of all civil traffic and the necessity of sending requisite foodstuffs for the civil population to this Northern Area by sea to CALAIS or BOULOGNE should be impressed on the Stench Government.3* Finally there arises the question of supply of theFrench and Belgian troops operating North of the BOiEdE.    It is a principle that each nation is responsible for tho main-tensaoe of its own troops and demands are assessed accordingly, In this crisis and to save unnecessary traffic en railways from South to North, it seems expedient that supply from CALAIS and BOULOGNE should be the main method.    The French at the present moment have three distinct groups of troops in the Northern Area.    One, the 36th Corps based on DUNKIRK, the End, the End Cavalry Corps not based on any Special Gare Regulaftrice, but supplied via CALAIS, the 3rd the Ith Army based on SOTTBVILLB.The
The supply of troops South of the line ETAPLES-ST.P0L can most conveniently be carried out from a Gare Regulatrise South of the SOMME - those North, however, could beast be fed from BOUL0GNE, CALAIS, or DUNKIRK.    The latter Port is now, however, liable to be closed and the present method of supply to the 3? French Corps would have te be changed, and presumably the system would then be similar to that adopted for the 2nd Cavalry Corps, viz: a hand to mouth method. The French have no large depots North of the SOMME and hence if French troops were to receive their food supplies through CALAIS and BOULOGNE the necessary arrangements would devolve on the British Army.

If the principle of supply from CALAIS or BOULOGNE of troops operating North of the ETAPLES-ST.P0L line is accepted, then it must be realized that this entails:

(a) a mare or less unlimited liability on the part of the British Army,

or

(b) that the French provide by sea supplies in bulk for issue to their troops - these supplies being held in our depots and issues made theref?.

(a) Implies the provision by us of additional stocks and hence affects shipping, while (b) would presumably entail the deflection on the part of the French of certain ships now employed on other services.

In either case the French could not be relieved of the necessity ef providing the requisite road transport, both M.T. and horsed.

The questions to which answers are now desired are hence as follows:-

A. Will the Cabinet issue instructions for the provision of sufficient shipping to carry the minimum amount of coal required by the French South of the SOMME, which is at present ?mputed at 600,000 tons monthly.

B. Will the Cabinet approach the French Government relative to releasing the Southern lines of railway by placing the necessary foodstuffs for civilian purposes in the area North of the SOMME by sea.

C. Will the Cabinet decide whether the supply of all troops operating above the line mentioned in paragraph 3 be undertaken, by the British.
