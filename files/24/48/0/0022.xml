(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty5s Government)OFFICERS I RESETTLEMENT. Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.(1).     On the 15th. November last the r;ar Cabinet expressed its approval of the Second (Interim) Report of the Committee on the Demobilisation of the Army (G-.T. 2446) in which it was recommended, inter alia, that an Appointments Board should be established to deal with the resettlement of officers and men of like standing.     I now submit a report by the Sub-Committee to which the task of working out a detailed scheme to that end was entrusted.(2).     The Sub-Committee recommend thp^t an &quot;Ex-Of ficers ?Resettlement Committee&quot; be set up under the aegis of theMinistry of Labour to work in conjunction with the ^Professionaland Business Register&quot; Branch of that Ministry.       This Committeewill include men of business together with representatives of theUniversities, the principal Professional Societies, theDepartments concerned and the unofficial Associations interestedin the training and employment&apos;of ex-officers.     Its functionswill be two-fold:(1)     To advise candidates as to the career for which they are best qualified and supply exact information as regards the methods of training for whatever calling they may select.(2)     To brine; employers and those who seek employment toget- er.IJhe executive work will be undertaken by the &quot;Professional and Business Register&quot; Branch of the Ministry of Labour which will be suitably expanded and &quot;Local Resettlement Committees&quot; will be established to co-operate with the district offices of the Branch. (3).     fhe Sub-Committee lay stress on the importance from the
tho national point of view of completing the. training or education of young ex-officers and they urge that, provision be made for this pur-pose not only by means of existing educational courses but also by special courses where that is necessary.     They point out that in many cases the organisation of courses will not suffice.   - It may be necessary for the state to help some of the persons concerned to meet the cost of their training or of their maintenance while under tuition or both.     The Sub-Committee propose that the investigation of such cases be entrusted to a special Training Committee but that responsibility for the provision of education be imposed on the appropriate Department which should be entrusted with the power of defraying fees, cost of maintenance, etc, cn the recommendation of the Training Committee.1-4) .      The Sub-Committee recommend that the claim of the families of. ex.-officers to be repatriated at the public expense, wholly or partially, be admitted in principle and further that it be recognised that an ex-officer is entitled to help in reaching a home overseas situated in seme cowitry other than that in which he joined the Forces.(5).     1 agree in the main with the findings of the Sub-Committee and I su&amp;mit them for the approval of the War Cabinet.     I should like at the same time to draw attention to the fact that early action as regards this matter is desirable,     The organisation should,  so far as possible, be set up at once in order to deal with officers now leaving the service.     Some systematic plan for dealing with them is essential and the experience which will be acquired in meeting their requirements will be most valuable as a preparation for, the heavy task of demobilisation.     It is desirable too that negotiations with employees-prald-mijaary to appointment should be carried out as far as possible while the officers concerned are with their units.     It is also important that the proposed Training Committee should be -organised as soon as possible so that proposals   j for the establishment of  special-courses may be discussed and the arrangements for giving advice and training brought into working
order &quot;before general demobilisation takes place. (6).      I desire to add that in my view it is essential that the following points should be kept in view in the creation of tho machinery for giving effect to the Committee^ recommendation.(I) The equip rent and personnel of the Professional and Business register must be adequate;(II) The utmost pains must be taken to secure competentand acceptable Advisory Committees for association with this work both at the centre and locally.(iii) Officers should have full and early information of the steps which are being taken.(7).     I suggest that the report should be published at once.Christopher Add!son. 9th. April, 1913.

REPORT.section i.Introductory.1. on 27th july, 1917, we submitted au interim report to the army demobilization sub-committee, recommending that &quot; an appointments board for officers and men of like standing (with the necessary provincial organization) should be established under the control of the ministry of labour, to co-operate with the existing universities appointments boards and other approved bodies.&quot; this recommendation was approved by the army demobilization sub-committee and incorporated in their second interim report for submission to the war cabinet. the war cabinet have now approved it.2. since the title &quot; appointments board &quot; was selected it has been found necessary, to avoid confusion with the already existing university appointments boards, to change it to &quot; ex-officers&apos; resettlement committee.&quot;3. after having submitted our first interim report, and on taking up the consideration of the organization of the appointments board, it became clear to us that all the interests concerned with the resettlement of officers in civil life were not represented on our committee. when we began to discuss the question of training it became obvious that it would be necessary to have a representative of the board of education, and that department was moved to appoint mr. e. k. chambers, c.b. with the question of training, moreover, was closely connected the question of the officer whose capacity to fulfil his functions in civil life had been reduced by reason of physical disability, and the minister of pensions was moved to appoint sir cyril jackson, k.b.e., to advise us regarding the treatment of such officers. we were advised that the admiralty was ready to fall into line with any proposals that might be made with regard to the resettlement of military officers in civil life, and, in accordance with their desire, captain t. p. h. beamish, c.b., r.n. was nominated to represent the lords commissioners of the admiralty. lastly, information and advice as to the class of officers now holding commissions, and generally as to the position and status of the officer, were necessary to our deliberations, and the military ,^secretary of, the war office was therefore approached regarding the appointment of a representative on the committee, ,and he nominated lieut-colonel r. h. more, c.m.g-.j as representing the branch of the war office interested in the classes of officers Avhose services should be retained in the army if possible. an additional member, lieut-colonel m. earle, d.s.o., has been appointed since the committee reached the stage of a decision to present this report.4. .thus strengthened, we have investigated the best means of establishing an organization to deal with ex-officei-s and the principles on which their resettlement can best be effected. twelve meetings have been held and, as a result, the following proposals are submitted for approval.section ii.Nature and Extent of the Problem.5. early in our deliberations we were confronted with the consideration that, although for military purposes his majesty&apos;s forces are divided into officers and other ranks, for general purposes of resettlement there will be found amongst the officers some for whom the machinery of the employment exchanges, which already deals with other ranks, may be cou-sidered to be suitable, and amongst the other ranks there will certainly be a number for whom the careers that do not draw their supply of recruits through employment exchanges will be more suitable. we have not failed to bear in mind both these classes, and throughout the following report must be understood to be referring to both, although the term &quot;officer&quot; (or &quot;officers&quot;) is alone used.6. in the case of soldiers the war office have already ordered that every man serving in the ranks shall bear on a document in his possession a record of his trade and industrial group. this will not only serve to assist in arranging the return of classes of labour according to industrial needs of the moment, but will also facilitate the settlement of each individual in the trade or occupation for which he is best adapted. in the main the men will be dealt with in large masses, the scheme providing for as many as 40,000 a day being demobilized.7. the officers, too, carry a record of service on which is an indication of profession or previous employment. the principle of release, in accordance with the demands of the employment market, followed in the resettlement of the men will be applied, so far as possible, in the case of the officers. they will be dispersed, in numbers proportionate to those of the men, as required for conducting drafts, viz., about 3 to 100, i.e., at the rate of 1,200 a day as a maximum.8. in the case of men of the naval forces, the admiralty is taking similar steps to have recorded on the papers of each man his industrial group and his trade, but does not
-contemplate recording the pre-war employment or profession of each officer.. It is not at present possible to forecast the maximum daily rate at which officers and men of the Naval forces will-be demobilized, but the numbers concerned are much less than those to be demobilized from the Army.9. The problem of finding employment for ex-officers exists at present in a limited degree, but on demobilization it will become one of some magnitude and of extreme urgency.10. Of the officers relinquishing their commissions, now or on demobilization, the following classes Avill probably need little or no assistance and will not need to pass through any of the machinery which it is proposed to provide under the recommendations of this Committee: (a.) Those who, on joining the forces, received from their employers a definite promise that their places would be kept open for them, and are able and willing to return.(b.) Those who, by reason of having joined the forces since the passing of the MilitaryService Acts, or for some other reason, received no such promise, but who cire -willingand able to return to their former occupations, (c.) Those Avho were not employees, but owned their own business or professional practice, towhich they are able and willing to return. (d.) Those who have sufficient means to be independent of employment.(&amp;) Regular officers who are continuing to serve during the wai&quot;, at the termination of which they will retire on their pensions. Of these there will still remain, however, a certain proportion whose private circumstances are such as to require them to supplement their pensions by finding employment and, speaking generally, it must be expected that this class will overlap those dealt with in the next paragraph.11. There remain five other classes, many of the members of which will require advice and possibly assistance.   These are : (/.) Those who, on the outbreak of war, had not yet entered upon or commenced training for any career.(g.) Those who, on the outbreak of war, were in training for some profession or. branch otbusiness, but whose training has been interrupted. (h.) Those who, owing to injuries received during the war, have been disabled from returningto their original profession, (i.) Those who, by reason of a chauge in their attitude of mind consequent upon their servicein the Forces, are unwilling to resume their previous occupations. (j.) Those who have obtained commissions from the ranks : (i.) Some have been selected from men who were serving on engagements for the period of the war only. Their standing in civil life varies considerably and their occupations before the war covered a wide field.(ii.) Others nave been selected from men of the old army serving on permanent attestations, and though they have the right to continue to serve after the war it is probable that many of them will elect to retire on the special terms applicable to them. These terms consist of a comparatively high rate of retired pay or gratuity to compensate them for giving up their profession.We consider that, not only should special endeavours be made to find suitable positions for such ex-officers of this class (j. (ii.)) as apply for advice or assistance, but that the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee should take steps through Regimental Associations, or by other means, to get into touch with them with a view to helping them to obtain employment in civil life in accord with the position they have attained in the Army.SECTION III.Constitution and Functions of Proposed Organization.12. Many ex-officers of the classes needing assistance will have had no previous experience in seeking employment suitable for their present needs. Their ignorance of the means of preparing for and securing it will lead to delay which may have serious financial consequence for them. Others will have vague.or erroneous ideas of the kind of work for which they are individually fitted, or of the means of entering and conditions of success in the calling to which they think of turning. The organization to be set up, therefore, must be qualified to deal, broadly speaking, with two essential points.(i.) To advise candidates as to the career for which they are best qualified and to provide exact information regarding the methods of training&apos; for whatever calling they may select;(ii.) To bring employers and those who se^k employment together under the conditions most favourable to both.13. It will be necessary on the one hand to arrange that the candidates should at the outset receive full and uniform information as to the general facilities for helping them, and on the other to provide local as well as central arrangements for helping them individually. Every officer will receive from the Naval or Military authorities in the course of demobilization a booklet showing certain general information as to various professions and openings, and, if he requires it, a form of application for registration. This form (known as Civil Employment Form (Officers)) A.F. Z 15 (Appendix), has already been drawn up for the Army by the War Office and the
GMinistry of Labour, and the Admiralty are proposing to use this form adapted to suit Naval requirements. We recommend the form not only for adoption during demobilization, but also-for use during the continuance of the war.14. Any officer who wishes to avail himself of the facilities provided, will be put in touch with the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee (see paragraph 19), and the Professional and Business Register (see paragraph 17), by means of this form, and his application will be treated either centrally or locally as the circumstances demand.15. The booklet of information referred to in paragraph 13 is in course of completion, but decisions on many points remain to be reached before it can assume its final shape.16. Experience has shown that a personal interview is the most satisfactory means both of advising and assisting those Avho seek employment, and of securing the information on which a recommendation to an employer can be based. An organization created to achieve these ends-will, therefore, need to have branches in all the chief industrial centres, in order that candidates may be interviewed locally and that employers, and those who seek employment, wherever situated, may be brought into communication with one another.The Professional and Business Register.17. As has already been decided by the Government the responsibility for the control of this work is to rest with the Minister of Labour, under whom an organization is to be created to enable him to discharge this responsibility. As stated in paragraph 2, this organization will be called the &apos;- Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee.&quot; It will work through the department, which is already maintained in the Ministry, called the &quot; Professional and Business Register.&apos;&apos;Co-operation of Professional and Business Men.18. The success of the organization will depend largely on the degree to which it secures the co-operation of professional and business men.19. We think that the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee should include representatives of the principal professional societies, with several men possessing general experience of business and commerce; representatives of the universities, and of unofficial associations interested in the training and employment of ex-officers. It should have power to co-opt other members, either temporarily or permanently, and Government departments should also be represented on it. The total membership should probably not exceed 30, and the main Committee should meet at least once a month. Its members personally and sub-committees formed for the purpose should afford guidance to the officials of the Register and. when necessary, interview selected candidates, advise them and give them every assistance in their power as to the choice of a career, the best method of approach and the facilities for training. Advice coming thus from men of uiidoubted position in their professions would, it is believed, cany greater weight with candidates than advice conveyed through official channels; while the fact that the candidates had been approved by a leading member of the profession would serve as a valuable introduction and recommendation to prospective employers.20. While the Minister of Labour should be President of the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee, we would suggest that he appoint a chairman from outside his department, and an official of the Professional and Business Register should be the General Secretary of the committee. It might be advisable that the Committee should include either the Secretary or some high official of the Ministry. The Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee would thus be responsible to the Minister of Labour in the same manner as the Central Labour Resettlement Committee will be responsible. We feel, however, that machinery should be provided for co-operation between these two bodies, and we suggest the formation of a small joint committee, consisting of members drawn trom the Central Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee and the Central Labour Resettle-ment Committee. This joint committee should be called together from time to time for the consideration of matters of interest to both principal bodies to whom the reports of the joint committee Avould be addressed.21. The Professional and Business Register, suitably expanded, will carry on the executive \vork. It will collect and distribute all information as to civil employment and will, in the preliminary stages, interview ex-officers desiring assistance, to enable them to return to suitable positions in civil life. Beside the central office in London, the Register has branches in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Bristol, Doncaster, Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham. These could readily be multiplied. The district offices of the Register will be assisted by Local Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committees, the constitution of which will be analogous to that of the Central Committee. The Local Authorities, Local Chambers of Commerce, and professional and business firms in the district will furnish some of the sources from which to obtain members of these committees. We are further of opinion that it is essential that these committees should include one or more ex-officers of His Majesty&apos;s forces.22. Territorial Force Associations, in view of their position as regards the ex-soldier, should be in touch with, and wherever possible represented on, the Local Committees. We consider also that regimental and other similar associations should be encouraged to assist their ex-officer members to obtain civil employment, and in suitable cases arrangements should be made for such associations to co-operate with the Professional and Business Register and Local Committees on the lines of the existing arrangements with the Universities Appointments Boards.23. It will be necessary to link up the work of the Local Ex-officers&apos; Resettlement Com-mittees with that of the Local Labour Resettlement Committees.
24. The complete organization should as far as possible be set up at once in order to deal with officers now leaving the Service. Their requirements have to be met on some systematic plan, and the experience which will be acquired in meeting them will be most valuable as a preparation for the heavier task on demobilization.25. A further means of making use of the co-operation of professional and business men will be to constitute Advisory Boards composed of panels of such men whose services the Ministry of Labour may be able to secure, which will give preliminary advice and information to -applicants for employment in each Army Area and on the Lines of Communication overseas and in Commands at home. It is thought that these Boards would be of the greatest value in assisting officers to crystallize their ideas regarding civil employment before the imminence of personal demobilization makes it a matter of urgency.Co-operation with Universities Appointments Boards and Unofficial Organizations.26. A considerable number of the officers demobilized will be university men. The Universities Appointments Boards have had wide experience of seeking suitable employment for their men and have achieved marked success in this regard. A system of active co-operation between the Professional and Business Register and the Universities Appointments Boards has already been set up. Approved unofficial organizations dealing with the employment of ex-officers should be brought into the scheme upon the lines already followed in the case of the Universities Appoint-ments Boards. Ex-officers should be at liberty to indicate any approved unofficial organization with which they may prefer to deal, and when such a preference is expressed, the matter should be referred to the organization indicated.Publicity.27. As soon as the necessary machinery is ready the Ministry of Labour should take all possible steps to draw the attention both of ex-officers and of employers throughout the United Kingdom to the formation of the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee, and to the facilities which it affords. Information as to vacancies should be collected as rapidly and fulty as possible, and it should be pointed out to employers that by applying to the Central Committee in London or to any of the Local Committees or affiliated organizations they can secure a choice of men from all parts of the kingdom, since information as to vacancies will be circulated to all the official and unofficial branches and agencies. This procedure will prevent the formation of outside organizations duplicating the work, causing confusion and overlapping, and in some cases making the collection of fees the primary object of their existence.28. Further we suggest that knowledge of the existence and aims of the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettle-ment Committee should be diffused as quickly and widely as possible in the Overseas Dominions.Overseas and Agricidtural Openings.29. We realize that a number of ex-officers will be unwilling to return to sedentary occupation and will desire an open-air life, and some of these can no doubt be found suitable employment in the Dominions. While recognizing, however, the importance of the development of the Dominions Overseas, we hope that emigration will not be the only opening suggested of such officers, and that it will be possible to settle a certain number of them on the land in this country.30. A condition precedent to the institution of any scheme of settlement of ex-officers on the land must be the release, for such a purpose, of the necessary land of suitable character and in suitable localities. We understand that the Board of Agriculture have under consideration draft legislation which will make available for the settlement of officers and men about 60,000 acres. We consider that private landowners might also be approached, as they would probably be favourably disposed to give priority of tenancy to service applicants, especially .in replacing farmers who have demonstrated their unfitness. They could also assist by notifying to the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee impending vacancies on their farms. There is as yet no information as to the extent of the demands likely to be made and whether the total acreage forthcoming under the new legislation, or as a result of appeals to private landowners will satisfy them, nor can it yet be said whether the land will be in all respects suitable. In due course, when more information is forthcoming, we will further -consider the matter.Personal Interuieivs between Employers and Applicants.31. We have considered whether arrangements could be made to obtain appointments for officers while they remain with their units, and we are inclined to think that, in view of the uncertainty which must necessarily exist as &apos; to the precise date of the demobilization of any individual officer,  it will not often be possible to  obtain for him a definite civil- appointment before his demobilization. We consider at the same time that every possible effort should be made to carry through the negotiation Avith employers preliminary to appointment while officers are still with their units, and that the Boards, which it is suggested in paragraph 25 may be able to visit the various areas, will materially assist this process. They are advised also that the Admiralty and War Office would probably be able to grant short leave for purposes of personal interviews to at least a proportion of the officers who were endeavouring ,to secure promises of employment between the cessation of hostilities and their release from: military duties.
SECTION IV.Training.32. We hold the opinion strongly that on national grounds the completion of training or education of the&apos;large body of young men who will leave the commissioned ranks of His Majesty&apos;s forces at the conclusion of the Avar, at the age of about 25 or under, should be provided lor on some comprehensive plan. Only by some organised effort of this kind can the nation&apos;s supply of this type of its personnel be maintained, and the losses from the interruption of training and casualties made good. u There will doubtless be suitable cases above this age; but speaking generally, the bulk of those whom it will be profitable to include in any educational or training schemes, and who will be willing to be included, will not be older. We further consider that the authorities should use every endeavour to devise the necessary courses of training or education. While existing courses will often be suitable, the provision of special courses will also, having regard to the age and experience of the applicants, be necessary. The assistance that is required is not only to be found in the organization of special courses but, in a great many cases, must take the form of grants of money in aid either of the necessary fees for the courses or of maintenance during the period of training, or of both. We feel that there is an obligation upon the community to provide this assistance, seeing that the diversion of the students from training and education has been caused by the paramount interests of the State; and we feel that the State should recognize this obligation in the fullest way. We do not overlook the fact that the average officer of the age and experience that we have in mind will be in possession of a gratuity at the end of the war which will be, in his eyes, a considerable sum. But we believe that in many &quot;cases the sacrifices that have been made by parents, and the strain of the Avar, will neoessarily have impaired the financial resources of the home, even to the extent of causing demands to be made on these gratuities. We admit that our anticipations may not be realized a&apos;nd that financial help from the State may be necessary in a few cases only. Hut we feel that srrch help should be forthcoming whenever, after a thorough examination of the circumstances, hVis&apos;shown to be necessary. We believe, further, that in&apos; any case the acknowledgment of the State&apos;s obligation in the matter Avill help materially in overcoming- the reluctauce to re-enter a state of pupilage Avhich it is natural that the jroung officer should feel. It is clear from the experience of the Ministry of Pensions that disinclination to go to school again will piwe a someAvhat formidable obstacle to the success of any schemes of re-education and training. But somehow this obstacle must be overcome if in the immediate future the nation is not to suffer from a lack of educated directing ability.33. We have considered the machinery to be devised for furnishing the requisite assistance. We think that: (a.) Courses of education and training must be devised by experts.(b.) More or less expert advice must be provided for each candidate in the selection of the -courses of training best adapted to the circumstances of his case, so as to ensure that his efforts may be directed in such manner as will prove most profitable to himself and to the community in general. (c.) The scheme should include the proAusion of financial help at the public expense where a - good case can be made out.34. Responsibility for (a) clearly rests with the Departments of Education (including Agricultural Education) and the Ministry of Labour; and the provision under (6) will.be the duty of the Training Committee referred to below. The investigations in connection with (c) should also be undertaken by this Committee, but it is desirable that as much information as possible Avith&apos;regard to an applicants career during his service should be placed at their disposal. 1 We are of opinion that a great deal of useful information in this connection could be collected by the Service authorities. Investigations could be undertaken during any waiting period which might elapse between the cessation of hostilities and the dispersal of the forces. We do not advocate that the provision of assistance and training should be made consequent on the quality of the applicants career in the Service, but anything creditable or discreditable, or any outstanding evidence as to particular ability in the applicants Service career should be knoAvn to the Committee Avhich is investigating his claim for training and financial assistance. It is a question for the Service authorities to decide how this information shall be obtained, but we are informed that boards could be set up for the purpose of examining applicants Avhile they are still in the Service. While these boards should obtain all possible information, including a record of statements made by the applicant himself Avith regard to his need of assistance, we consider it inadvisable that steps should be taken by these boards to investigate more closely an applicants financial position.35. The actual machinery for dealing with cases involving further education or framing must clearly be linked up, on the one hand with the Professional and Business Register and the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee, and on the other, Avith the Educational Departments. The most suitable link Avould be a Special Training Committee appointed as an Inter-Departmental Committee by the Departments concerned, with an educational Chairman and containing members familiar at first hand Avith the problems and methods of training. It is important that this Committee and the Ex-Officers&quot; Resettlement Committee should contain members in common. This will ensure complete touch being maintained between the bodies dealing with the two sides of
the whole question. We should prefer a single Training Committee, but as the departments respon-sible for education are different for England, Scotland and Ireland, respectively, it is possible that it may prove more convenient to have separate committees located in Edinburgh and Dublin. Applicants for whom further education or training seems primd facie desirable would be referred for consideration to the Training Committee, who would go into the circumstances of each case, and would give further advice to the applicant, and also make a Tecommendation to the appropriate department as to whether, subject to whatever test as to means may be decided upon, financial assistance would be justified. The appropriate department should be responsible for arranging for the provision of training in educational institutions. The appropriate Agricultural Department should arrange for the provision of training in agriculture. The Ministry of Labour should arrange for the provision of training by employers under indentures of apprenticeship or articles or similar arrangements. Each of these departments should be entrusted with funds for necessary fees, maintenance or other forms of financial assistance.36. Some of the interviewing of applicants for training could with advantage be done at head-quarters by members of the Training Committee sitting as a rota, but this Committee could also obtain assistance locally from members of local committees attached to the district offices-of the Register, and from members of the staffs of the universities and from the local inspectors of ^ the Education Departments. It is probable that in some cases applications for assistance will be put forward direct from universities or technical schools on behalf of officers who have not approached the Register, but have returned on their own initiative to their universities or technical schools and have subsequently discovered their need of assistance. Similar applications may be made to the Ministry of Labour on behalf of men engaged in professions or business. The departments concerned should obtain the advice of the Training Committee in such cases. .....37. It may be found, so far as formal education or. training is concerned, that courses already in existence at universities or elsewhere will be suitable, and that all that will be necessary will be to provide funds to cover the fees, and in suitable cases maintenance allowances, for officers attending them. Some special courses will, however, be required, and it should be part of the duty of the Training Committee to consider the desirability of these,, and to make recommendations to the Education Departments, who will doubtless be able to get them arranged at suitable institutions.38. It may also be of advantage to set up the proposed Training Committee at an early date, in order that proposals for the establishment of special courses may be discussed, and the arrangements for giving advice and training brought into working order before general demobilization actually begins. Possibly the Training Committee might at once take in hand the planning of courses of instruction for convalescent officers. Such courses would be arranged in conjunction with the Medical Authorities of the War Office, who are responsible for these officers.39. The Minister of Pensions, on the other hand, is responsible for the care of disabled ex-officers, but we are of opinion that the Minister of Pensions should be invited to exercise his statutory powers through the intei&apos;mediary of the Ex-Officers&apos; Resettlement Committee; though the disabled may sometimes require special courses they can generally be associated with the able-bodied, and where this is possible we believe it would be advantageous.40. We feel that everything possible should be done to prevent delay (a) in investigating the candidate^ financial position, and (ft) in providing the training to fit him for the particular avocation he has selected.   It is felt that a multiplication of authorities to whom the candidate -must appeal would only result in confusion, dissatisfaction, and the failure of the most carefully considered scheme.SECTION V.Employment in the Civil Service.41. We have given a good deal of thought to the subject of employment in the Civil Service of officers and men who have served in His Majesty&apos;s forces, and we consider that it would be in every way desirable that the State should set a suitable example in this matter to municipal and private employers. We have been favoured with the evidence of Mr. Stanley Leathes, the First Civil Service Commissioner, and we have caused the Treasury to be approached, both by the Admiralty and by the War Office, with the following recom-mendations: (i.) From the first day of demobilization, and for one year after, all permanent appointments in the Civil Service should be reserved for ex-officers and ex-soldiers.(ii.) The period of service with his Majesty&apos;s forces should count as service iu the appointment to which the individual is posted, and the commencing salary should be that which would have been reached in the same time by the usual increments of the appointment.(5422)b
SECTION VI,Repatriation of Ex-Officers.44. Our attention has been drawn to the importance of providing assistance for the repatriation of ex-officers who came from overseas to obtain commissions. We are informed that no difficulties are likely to present themselves in settling a policy of assisting the repatriation of the officers and men themselves, but we believe that no decision has been reached in regard to the extension of the assistance so as to include the cost of repatriating the wives and families. We are also of opinion that any scheme of assistance should be wide enough to enable an officer or man to receive help in reaching a new home overseas in substitution of that which he would have been entitled to to enable him to return, to the home he left when he joined up for the war.(ii) Repatriation of families. In regard to repatriation of ex-officers&apos; families three cases arise :-(a) Those who came and brought their wives and families with them.(b.) Those who came and joined the Forces, their wives and families following.(c.) Those who came and married in this country, (ii.) Substituted passages. Cases may arise in which a man. for example, who has come from the Argentine may wish after the war to take up his abode in Canada, or vice versa, and it is for consideration how far such substituted passages should be permitted.45. We have not attempted to work out any scheme in detail, nor even to set forth at length the considerations which bear upon these points. It is not quite within our province to do so, but we are so impressed with the need of a comprehensive scheme of resettlement of those in Avhose interests we have been entrusted with the duty of making recommendations, that we feel that we should draw attention to what we regard as an important feature of any such scheme. The expatriation of the families was an advisable, and in some.cas&apos;es a necessary, condition of the response to the call made by the Mother Country, and their repatriation seems to us to be a matter of vital concern to the Empire and indeed a definite State obligation. We recognize that any concession in this matter must be subject to due limitations, but at the moment we are not concerned to do more than recommend that the claims of the families to be repatriated at the public expense, or with assistance from Public Funds, should be approved in principle, and that substituted passages as indicated above should be allowed as part of any scheme to be adopted.(Signed)      R. H. BRADE, (Chairman). T. P. H. BEAMISH.B. BURNETT-HITCHCOCK, Brig.-Gen. E. K. CHAMBERS. M. EARLE, Lieut.-Col. ALFRED L. GOODSON. CYRIL JACKSON. ARTHUR LEETHAM, Lieut.-Col. R. H. MORE, Lieut.-Col. H.

The open competitive examinations should he replaced by a method of selection during the first year of demobilization.We af6 of opinion that the method Of selection might include some kind of educational test, either by qualifying examination or by inspection of school records, or by both, as may be recommended to the Treasury by the Civil Service Commissioners. We recommend that, in making selections from among those who pass whatever test or tests may be decided upon, the candidate&apos;s service should be accepted as an important factor&apos; in each case.(iv.) Before general demobilization, disabled officers, ccp.te.ru paribus should have preferential claims to temporary appointments which are now available, or may become available before the termination of hostilities. We are in agreement with the recommenda-tidn of the Civil Service Commission that the practice of making some permanent appointments should now be resumed.42. It is well to point out, however, that the positions most in demand by the ex-officer, such as the So-called Higher Division Clerkships, are strictly limited in number.43. The Treasury have since replied that the consideration of these suggestions has been remitted to a Committee set up by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider the whole question of the recruitment of the Civil Service after the war.
