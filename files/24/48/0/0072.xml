Extract frem letter from Lord IlacdonnoH to Lr, Duke.(Letter beginsI.have not been precluded by the doctors from receiving visits from my friends, and I have seen many well able to. speak of the state of public opinion hore0     The passing of tho conscription clause of the Llan-Powcr Bill has enormously affected feeling in Ireland,, and I iear there is no doubt that the enfsreement of the clause will be mot by.universal resistance, I do not think there will be open violence - though I am not sure on that point - but that there will bo universal passive resistaneo there seems to be no doubt, and this passive resistance will not mean merely refusal to obey the summons to enrol, but will affect every subsequent proceeding, so that refusal to drill, refusal to obey any order whatever in Barraoks, in fact a universal refusal to obey any instructions of drill sergeants or superior officers may be anticipated.  . The only mitigation which   I can foresee as possible is that some change of mind may be brought about \*j the passing of a really good Homo Ru4-Q measure, - such a measure as approximates to the ideal of both sections of the -Nationalists in the Convention.     That ideal only praoirically differs, from tho concession which the Southern Unionists were willing to make in respect of the fiscal question.     The Southern Unionists were willing to grant Excise but reserved Customs.     Tho nationalist idea claims the imposition of Customs but does not claim the right to make commercial treaties other than through tho Golonial and foreign Offices.     Surely this difficulty may be overcome ospecially as both sections of tho Nationalists are willing that there&apos; should bo free trade arrangements between Great Britain and Ireland and that Ireland should contribute to the expenses of the Empire- such a sum as having regard to her condition and to past circumstances the Imperial Parliament should decide to be suitable.     \7ith such a Home Rule Act and the creation at an early date of an Irish Parliament I am not Without hopes that a revulsion of fooling in this country will take place which will give you the men you want and will produce an entirely now era between Great Britain and Ireland..(Lc&amp;ter ends).(Signed). lUiGDOBiiBLi.-
