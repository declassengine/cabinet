(This Document is the PropertyHis Britannic fv1ajesty&apos;s Gcve&apos;9.MAN-i:0V/LRAlJD   MUNITIONSI circulate to my colleagues the followingminute by Sir Stephenson Sent on the immediate proposals of the Ministry of National Service, s.nd I must request that this matter he discussed in Cabinet before any action is taken.me the attached document.     The part which concerns the Ministry of Munitions is paragraph (a)-1.    As I understand it, the intention is to issue a proclamation that men of the ages of 19 and 20 engaged on munitions v/ork other than hull construction and repair and the production of shale oil, aro at once to be clecertif icated.     At least three important points are not clear!-(a) Is it the intention at the same timeto call all these men up for service or for medical ezamination?(b) Is it intended to call up men of allmedical categories or only, as at present, thoso of Grade 1?fc) Is the proclamation to specify a date by which the men are to report?2.     It is assumed that the object of the schemeV7INSTON 3. CHURCHILL,April 18, 1918,The Ministry of National Service have handed/
is to provide quickly a large number of young men for the army. .   VJhile the Department are in entire sympathy with this object, they cannot lose sight of the fact that it is of equal importance to maintain intact the machinery necessary to equip the men when recruited.The proposal involves serious interference with the existing machinery of recruitment from munitions work which has provided a substantial number of reoruits, and, since the need for recruiting-became more urgent, has been aocelerated so as to show quicker results, and is still being accelerated, as the following table will show:-Releases from the 7th May to the39th December, 1917. 67,678 Postings from the 7th May to the29th December, 1917. 48,644 Releases from the 1st January tothe 29th March, 1918. &apos; 52,120 Postings from the 1st January tothe 29th March,. 1918. 20,911 Releases from the 1st January tothe 12th April, 1918. 49,172 Postings from the 1st January tothe. 12th April, 1918. 26,692In addition to this last figure of postings should be added an estimated figure of 2,0?6o for voluntary enlistments to the Royal Uaval Air Service.The/
The recent acceleration in the rate of releases since the commencement of the German offensive is exemplified in the following figures:-Releases for week ending the15th iiarch, 1918. 3,640 Releases for week ending the 2nd March, 1918. 3,730 Releases for week ending the29th Maroh, 1918. 7,646 Releases for week ending the5th April, 1918. 8,102 Releases for week ending the12th April, 1910. 0,9503.     The machinery in existence is admittedly cumbrous and intricate; there are, in fact, 66 local offices, employing in all a staff of about 2,200 persons, engaged on the recruitment of munitions workers, but the machinery is well established, and a wide departure from it, such as is proposed, must create delay and confusion in the recruitment of men in munitions works over the ages specified in the proclamation.   It will be easily understood that, assuming that the mon of 19 and 20 are to be called to the Colours, a pause in the ordinary routine of recruitment in munitions works will bo necessary until the effect of this recruitment is ascertained.   Again, it must be cppreoiated thrt tho Munitions Area Release Scheme, which has been in osistonoe/
existence for some twelve months, is thoroughly well understood, both by employers and labour, and serious confusion end unrest may easily be caused by the proposal to labour eng&amp;ged, on munitions.     This unrest spreads throughout the works snd diminishes production.4.     While it is true th:t the Department have advooated the Irclean outfr by ages, that advocacy was conditional upon fairly long notice being given of the Government&apos;s intentions, so that employers might have time to adjust themselves to the new circumstances under which they would have to manufacture.   The Department have no doubt that the expedient proposed will not have the desired result.   A similar experiment was tried a year ago, when the &apos;./ar Cabinet directed that all men under 23 should be recruited.    It was at once found necessary to make certain exceptions.     These exceptions rapidly grew, and after about two months the net result of the scheme was only some 3,000 recruits for the army, at the price of much friction and waste of time.     The Department are in no doubt that had the experiment never been tried, the not result to the army in the matter of recruits over the same period would have been a larger yield.5./
5.     The proposal of the Ministry of National Service apparently contemplates the making of certain exceptions in favour of the most vital items of the munitions programme.   Such exceptions would necessarily include tanks, guns, machine guns aeroplane engines, certain chemical shell, small c^rms and their ammunition, poison gas, tubes, iron, steel, blast furnaces, certain quarrying and mining work.     Assuming this list to bo compiled, it would certainly then be found that these industries are dependent upon others, and so the list would grow.     It must not be overlooked that the Department have already had experience of this procedure, and are confident that a similar result would ensue. Moreover, there will be a large number of men on tho fringes of the munitions which it is decided to except, and the process of determining whether these border-line men are entitled to fovoured treatment will seriously retard the recruiting of the men of the ages to be specially oalled up.    lor example, in -v firm making bolts and nuts, how is a distinction to be made between the man making bolts for tanks and the man who is making precisely the same bolts for ogricultural machinery? Purther, by erecting an umbrella of this kind over certain vitally/
vitelly necessary munitions^ it follows that -(a) The difficulty of Inducing the firms andlabour concerned to agree to dilution and substitution is greatly increased.(b) Men cannot be recruited who, but for theumbrella, could with due  irecautions be spared from these munitions without undue loss of output Or peril to tho machinery of production.*6.     To sum up the Departments objections to theproposal put forward by the Ministry of National Service -(i)   The proposal will not effect the desired object of a quicker release of men of tho ages contemplated.(ii)   It will aotually retard the present machinery of release as regards men of all other ages, which is progressing favourably and has been accelerated at need as the above table shows.(iii)   It constitutes an unnecessary menace to production.(iv)   3y discarding the present well-understoodprocedure, the existing good understanding between labour and the Government may be imperilled.7.     The Department are convinced that the economic procedure, both from the point of view of the quicker provision of men and the maintenance of the possibility of supply, is a speeding-up of to-dayTs machinery, but they/
they r ecognise that political expediency may necessitate the Government1s withdrawing from munitions works men of a certain age.     Should the Government consider that this lattor course is essential in the national interest, it is submitted that to maintain production in the future reasonable notice must be given to tho employer of the wholesale withdrawal of men of certain ages.Council Member &quot;L&quot;. April 18, 1918.Proposal by tho Ministry of National Service to call to the Colours Men aged 19 and 20,It is intended to send to the War Cabinet to-night a draft Proclamation under Clause 3 of the new Bill withdrawing certificates from men born in 1898 end 1899, if in Grade 1 or Grade 2.(The Proclamation deals only with Tribunal exemptions, but at the same time the Minister wishes to issue instructions cancelling the administrative certificates/
certificates of protection held by -(a)   Men under the M.A.R.O. soheme horn in the years 1398 and 1899* except und^r Section A.and any other occupations which are protected as to the age of 19 in the Schedule.(d)   Mon holding agricultural&quot;&apos; vouchers, with the provision that any man who is whole time employed as a skilled ploughman on a farm in farm work may apply to a Tribunal for exemption upon occupational grounds.As regards men coming under (a), it will benecessary for R, 1 to see the Ministry of Munitionsthis afternoon.As regards mon under (b), it will benecessary for R.3 to see the President of the Board of Agriculture and Sir Arthur Lee this afternoon.R&apos;April 17, 1918.
