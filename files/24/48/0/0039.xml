[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  April 1918.SECRET.G.T. 4239.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report; from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 17th April, 1918.Part I: General Remarks.The reception of the new man-power proposals is described.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press upon the military situation, or foreign affairs, on the comb-out, on pensions, on food, on labour, and politics, and on education is summarised.Part III: District Reports.The situation continues tranquil, and no definite opposition to the man-power proposals is at present ascertainable.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving stoppage of work. There are no strikes of any seriousness, (b.) Not Involving Stoppage of Work. No serious disputes at present exist.New Man-Power Proposals.The industrial position in the country continues quiet, and the proposals of the Government for increasing the field of recruitment for the Army have so far led to no forcible expression of opposition. It is, however, suggested in reports from various quarters that the older men, who have hitherto formed the main support of the constitutional party in the Trade Unions, show signs of joining the opposition which had hitherto been confined to those younger men who were classed as irre-sponsible. Specially is this the case on the Clyde and in Manchester. From other quarters, as for instance Sheffield, it is stated that the extension of conscription to Ireland has had an entirely good effect. This view cannot, however, be accepted as a correct statement of the position everywhere. In Lanarkshire, for instance, the defeat of the &quot;down tools &quot; policy was due in a considerable measure to the loyalty of the Irish miners under the influence of their priests, and it is anticipated that the Irish proposals will have as one of their effects a change of policy among these men.On the whole, however, and notwithstanding resolutions such as that by the N.U.R. in South Wales, to which reference is made in Part III, it may be said that the proposals have been received in Trade Union circles with smaller expressions of opposition than might have been anticipated, and the voluntary enlistment of miners in South Wales continues to be a favourable symptom.The volume of opposition in the Labour press is very large, and, with the exception of the &quot;British Citizen,&quot; all papers, even those such as &quot;Justice &quot; and. Summary.I. General Remarks.[1100-25]B
the &quot; Clarion,&quot; which are eminently patriotic, combine in their hostility. Their grounds of opposition are in many cases the same.The first criticism from practically all the papers is that the extension of the age will only supply 100,000 additional men for the army, and that these men will not be fit for service for a period of six months at least. It is urged that this result does not justify the conscription of men up to the age of fifty-one. This leads to the second criticism, that the real reason for raising the age is not to get men for the Army, but to have every possible man in khaki with the object of industrial conscription.Practically every paper insists on the requisite of fitness rather than numbers, and the enormous reserve of young man power in America is commonly held to disprove the necessity for any measure of the sort now contemplated. It is argued that if, as has been stated, one-and-a-half million young Americans are to be sent to the front this year, the 100,000 elderly men, to secure whom the Bill has been passed, will prove entirely unnecessary.An additional argument used by the &quot;Co-operative News,&quot; and suggested, though not specifically employed, by the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Call,&quot; is based on the belief, which is stated to have been expressed by experts, that the close of the present offensive on the part of Germany will be followed by immediate peace proposal^ and the &quot;Co-operative News &quot; thinks &quot; it may be taken for granted that if the enemy made peace proposals under such conditions the Governments of Great Britain and France would be forced to examine these proposals with an open mind.&quot;The provisions as regards Ireland are received by the Labour press with just as much hostility as those for Great Britain. It is thought genera 11 v that an attempt to impose forcible conscription on a reluctant Ireland will inevitably result in widespread rebellion and bloodshed, and that even if conscription be successful, it will be necessary to keep two battalions in the country to maintain order for every new battalion thus raised. It is suggested by the paper &quot; Irish Opinion &apos;.&apos; that the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (with which Mr. Jim Larkirf is intimately connected) is about to call a general strike in protest against the proposals.Evidence accumulates that one effect of the success of the German offensive on the West has been to stimulate activity in all essential industries, and it is not anticipated that opposition to the man-power proposals will go to the length of sacrificing the vital interests of the country. Labour has been quick to grasp the significance of the threats to x\miens and the coast ports, and as long as the crucial position on the West continues it seems indubitable that the working classes of the nation will as a whole play their part. All that is necessary is that they should be convinced of the seriousness of the position, and that the measures which they are asked to accept are indeed requisite in the interests of the Army. It would be fatal were any grounds given for the belief that the straits in which the Army finds itself are to be exploited in the interests of capitalist employers. The view that the ulterior object of the Man-Power Bill is to re-enact under another guise those provisions which previously took the form of the leaving certificate would be fatal to its acceptance by organised Labour as a whole, and it is this suspicion which will lend force to the arguments used in the Labour press. Generally speaking, how-ever, it is certainly the case that these papers represent a much smaller minority of the Labour movement than they did a few months ago, and that the seriousness of the present position has rallied a large number of men who were previously tending towards pacifism, and bitter hostility to all Government measures.II. Press Comments.The Military Situation.Military affairs receive little direct attention in the Labour and Socialist press proper, though the more bourgeois papers contain interesting, if not very optimistic, articles.The comment is mostly oblique, coming under the head of man-power, and if not actually discouraging,&quot;is perhaps somewhat gloomy. The &quot; New Age&quot; says that the first stage of the German offensive must be regarded as having been com-paratively successful, in spite of the fact that the event was foreseen, and that, as we are assured, ample preparations had been made to meet it. This is substantially the point of view of others of the patriotic papers, though the &quot; British Citizen &quot;
and &quot; John Bull,&quot; which eulogise in particular the fine courage of the men, remain confident.The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; attributes the German successes to surprise, while the &quot; Herald &quot; thinks that they have been due to the incompetence of the governing class.The Man-Power Bill.This subject is dealt with in Part I of this Report,Foreign A fairs.The landing of Japanese troops at Vladivostok has led to renewed comment on the Far Eastern situation. The &quot;Herald,&quot; last week contented, is now gloomy, and affirms that the war against the Russian Revolution has begun. The &quot;Call&quot; desires to know why the American opposition to this step was withdrawn, and also why it was necessary for the British to land. Hostile references appear also in the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and &quot; Freedom.&quot; The &quot;British Citizen &quot; is, however, still enthusiastic.The question of peace negotiations is the basis of a long article in the &quot;Herald,&quot; which also contains a further denunciation of secret diplomacy as revealed in the secret treaties, the Lichnowsky memorandum, and the Franco-Austrian negotiations. There is a tendency in this section of the press to attack the French Government as being chiefly responsible for the prolongation of the war. This is suggested in the &quot;Call&quot; and &quot;Labour Leader &quot; in their notes on the Clemenceau-Czernin controversy, as well as by the &quot;Herald.&quot;The Lichnowsky memorandum continues to attract attention. The &quot; New Age &quot; finds in its publication an indication that the flood of war is subsiding. Change of heart in the German people is inevitable, and this will mean the over-throw of the Kaiser and his Junkers, particularly if the Allies follow it up by publishing a democratic peace offer. The &quot; Leeds Citizen &quot; emphasises the importance of the service done to this country by Prince Lichnowsky.The Comb-Out.The comb-out among miners and engineers meets with practically no interest in face of the newer and wider proposals. The &quot;Herald&quot; is, however, of the oninion that the threatened strike can now be definitely considered as off, but that new &quot; panic legislation &quot; may easily revive unrest.Pensions.Mr. Hodge&apos;s successful efforts to increase the scale of pensions receive a warm welcome, and are hailed as a victory over red-tape. This is particularly notice-able in the papers which are politically opposed to him. The &quot;Herald&quot; hopes that the &apos;1 full and adequate maintenance which is their due&apos;&apos; will soon be paid to disabled soldiers and their dependants. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; which incidentally refers to pensions as &quot;blood money,&quot; and the &quot;Bradford Pioneer,&quot; are also of opinion that credit is due to Mr. Hodge, while the c&apos; British Citizen !&apos; is exuberant in the delight expressed.Food.Interest is still displayed in the food situation, although the comment is no longer of a very hostile character. There is some complaint that insufficient attention is being paid to the advice of the Consumers&apos; Council, but, apart from this, attention is concentrated chiefly on the need for increased production. &quot;Justice,&quot; for example, has an article on Agricultural Bolshevism, in which it maintains that the increase of food production is being hindered by landlords and rich men. The &quot; Leeds Citizen&quot; is eager for the City Council to take a hand in food production, while the &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot; calls for a concerted national effort in the same direction.Labour and Politics.The &quot;Herald&quot; describes the recent I.L.P. conference at Leicester, the &quot; key-note&quot; of which is said to have been the necessity for peace, as &quot; a huge success.&quot;
&apos;&apos; Justice,&apos;&apos; on the other hand, attacks it violently, and is particularly bitter against Mr. Macdonald for his whole conduct in regard to German responsibility for the war. The same paper contains an angry article against the B.S.P. conference at Leeds, and this is also roughly handled by the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; a paper under I.L.P. control.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; will have nothing to do with the proposal that Lord Lansdowne should be the next Prime Minister, and suggests that a durable peace can only come through international Socialism, but the &quot; Cotton Factory Times&quot; apparently lends its support to the Lansdowne movement.This paper and the &quot;Call&quot; are both discontented with the Labour Partvs conduct in giving up its propagandist campaign at the very moment when it was most essential to insist upon its own proposals for a peace settlement.Education.Almost the whole of the Labour and Socialist press devotes attention to the conference recently held by the National Union of Teachers at Cambridge. This conference decided not to join the Labour Party, and not to insist on equal pay for men and women teachers. On both scores the Union receives castigation, epithets such as &quot;snobbish&quot; and &quot;reactionary&quot; being freely applied.&quot;Justice&quot; deplores the result of the ballot taken recently in Lancashire regarding the abolition of half time. The &quot;Cotton Factory Times &quot; is more liope-fnl, and thinks that progress is being made.Shipping.The &quot; Clarion&quot; contains rather a remarkable article on shipbuilding, written as the result of conversations with shop stewards in the industry. The writer has become convinced that bureaucratic methods are chiefly responsible for failure. This article marks a distinct change in opinion in a paper which has been inclined to applaud the results of State control in other directions.The &quot; Herald&quot; suggests that the services of many skilled engineers, who are at present idle in the Inland Waterways and Docks, Royal Engineers, should be utilised in the shipyards.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in this district is on the whole satisfactory and little local unrest is reported.The feeling as regards the Man-Power Bill has greatly improved, and in cases where calling-up notices have been received, the matter has been accepted quietly. Trouble was, however, threatened at the works of a firm at Chiswick owing to the action of the employers in placing more favoured workmen in important shops in order that they might thus escape military service.At a meeting of xlrsenal workers on the 11th, which was also attended by a number of ex-soldiers, the Woolwich Arsenal Shop Stewards5 Committee was attacked for its pacifist and Bolshevist character, and the speaker, himself formerly a shop steward, also made objection to the appointment of officers in the Arsenal who were not fitted for their posts through any special engineering skill.Considerable disappointment as regards extra rations is reported from Messrs. Cubitfs where the oilers complain that their work should have been recognised equally with that of other manual workers.South-Western.A printed circular, apparently emanating from the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners at Southampton, has been addressed to various Labour Unions in Australia. In it the Australian workmen are requested not to come over and work in this country, as by doing so they will release men for the army.Continual unrest and friction among the men employed in the Isle of Wight is reported by the Ministry of Munitions.
West Midlands.The Man-Power Bill is the chief topic of discussion in this district; and it is reported that there is considerable resentment among the older men at their inclusion, as they believe that it is owing to their efforts that the younger men were made to realise the seriousness of the situation. The number of fit Belgians employed is still causing much dissatisfaction among all workers.Some signs of unrest continue at Coventry, owing to the recent discharge of the shop steward Dingley from Messrs. Hotchkiss&apos; works, and it is thought that he will take any opportunity that may present itself to stir up agitation. Many of the men believe that shop stewards will be specially chosen for dismissal in the&apos; future, and should any such action be taken trouble is likely to ensue.Another cause of discontent in the Birmingham ^district is the growing practice of evicting tenants, which will probably result in pressure from the Trades Councils in order to obtain the amendment of the Rente Act,Pacifists still display a certain activity, but do not seem to be making much headway. They have already begun to distribute leaflets in anticipation of a General Election, and Mr. George Lansbury recently addressed a fairly large audience at Birmingham and met with a good reception.&apos;Yorkshire and East Midlands.Slight local unrest is reported from this area, but upon the important question of man-power no trouble is at present evident, though it is thought that later when the proposals have been put into force, calling-up orders may not be received so quietly. At the moment, however, the men are so impressed by the seriousness of the situation that, as in other parts, loyal support will be extended to the Government, while at the same time the power of shop steward agitators is at a low ebb, and the pacifists at Sheffield are stated to have come to the conclusion that open propaganda is useless. Their intention is now apparently to confine their work to private con-versation in the workshops.The importance of striking while the iron is hot is much emphasised in this district, while among the concrete proposals in the Bill, the extension of compulsion to Ireland is said to have had a very satisfactory effect.As many as ten protest strikes have occurred among the miners, but these are thought to be due more to the method of calling-up which has been adopted and to the continued presence of dilutees than to unwillingness to serve.The small meat ration is at present causing some disgust at Leeds, but it is thought that this is to some extent due to a misapprehension as to extra rations, and that after fair trial of the new scheme all trouble will subside. Some agitation has also been made at Messrs. Vickers&apos; Works, Sheffield, with regard to the question of beer. The men affirm that they are entitled to an allowance for their dinner which men at another works are receiving.North- Western.The general situation in this area is decidedly quiet. Attention has been directed chiefly to the Western front, and the Man-Power Bill which has come out of the situation there. Generally speaking the Governments proposals have been received quietly, and no serious trouble is anticipated, though the representative of the Ministry of Munitions fears that this may be the calm before a storm.The National Conference of Shop Stewards, which was held at Manchester on the 13th and 14th, was attended by only 30 delegates, among whom was no representa-tive from Scotland or of the miners. The main business of the Conference was the discussion of a &quot;suggested scheme of organisation,&quot; and a &quot;suggested programme of Labour.&quot; Under the former a conference was proposed, having as its object to organise the workers on a definite plan with regard to the discussion of peace issues, while the &quot; Programme of Labour &quot; followed tne usual lines demanding peace negotiations and a democratic Government. The general attitude of the Conference was, however, entirely opposed to any discussion of peace at the present moment, and consideration of the programme was deferred to a more opportune time, in spite of vehement opposition from W. F. Watson. Another resolution of Watson&apos;s. urging the organisation of a National Assembly of Workers Committees to override all parliamentary machinery, was also rejected by the Conference.[1100-25] C
The proceedings of this Conference, past meetings of which have almost invariably led to serious trouble, may be regarded as significant, not oniy of the temper in this district, but of that of &quot;the workers throughout the country.The men iii the building trade at Liverpool are demanding an increase, which will equalise their earnings with those of builders employed in the shipyards. In the event of their claim being refused, they threaten to leave their present emplov-ment in order to go to the shipyards.It is at Liverpool also that further discontent over the food situation has been expressed by dockers and their wives. They state that food is being allowed to go bad in the docks, and the men say that they are only prepared to &quot;join up &quot; if their families are guaranteed adequate supplies.Northern.The situation in this district appears to be very satisfactory and at present all pacifist agitation is completely in abeyance. Holidays were given up at Easter without any grumbling, and the scarcity of beer is accepted patiently.South Wales.No labour unrest is reported from this district at present, and it is anticipated that the comb-out will proceed smoothly. The Unofficial Reform Committee displayed much activity in opposing the Government upon this question, but their efforts have proved unavailing, as large numbers of jGung miners have been flocking to the colours voluntarily. Most significant is the fact that the largest number of these are stated to have come from the Merthyr and Aberdare districts, which are pacifist strongholds. The South Wales MrnerV Federation has voted in favour of supervision of recruiting by the Federation, as it is thought that this will prove a more equitable and easy method of taking the men required than to leave the &quot;comb-out &apos;&apos; entirely to the military authorities.An unfavourable impression has been caused by a. resolution of the District Council of the N.U.R. protesting against any further &quot; comb-out &quot; of railwaymen as it would be destructive of trades unionism, and demanding an immediate armistice and negotiations for peace. It is thought, however, that this does not represent the views of the majority of the men.Scotland.Little local unrest is reported from this district and agitation has for the moment subsided.The Man-Power Bill here as elsewhere is the central topic of interest, and the proposals put forward by the Government appear to be meeting with a considerable degree of opposition.The extension of conscription to Ireland has been well received by all but the Irish section of the population. They, however, seem to have determined to return to their own country to escape military service. ,The inclusion of the older men has considerably weakened the Governments hold on a section which has throughout exercised a moderating influence in this area, and local opinion is to the effect that too much reliance must not be placed on the continuance of the present calm. This view is also supported by the Chief Investiga-tion Officer of the Ministry of Munitions.The malcontents are expected to make their great effort during the May day demonstrations, which are this year to be held on a week-day, and will take the form of a public holiday. The extreme importance of sending down speakers of weight and distinction before and during this event is strongly emphasised.As many as 34 groups were represented at the I.W.G.B. Conference on the 6th and 7th, and this body appears to be prosperous both as regards finance and membership. It is now undergoing some reorganisation and is changing its name to the &quot; -West of Scotland Industrial Union.&quot; The C.W.C. meetings are on the other hand poorly attended, and little enthusiasm for this organisation is at presentdisplayed. . .     .   .John McLean, the well-known extremrst, who was released from prrson last summer, but whose conduct since that time has been extremely unsatisfactory, has again been arrested. He has considerable influence among the hot-heads, but no indication of how his arrest will be taken has yet been received.
There has been further trouble among the miners in Lanarkshire over recruiting, but the unrest is less than it was last week and is thought to be subsiding.IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The situation this week is remarkably calm, and little serious unrest is reported from any quarter.The Shipyard Labour Department have two new stoppages of work to report. These involved only 176 workers; seventeen old cases also remained over from last week but a settlement has now been achieved in all these cases.The more important of the two new strikes reported was one at Messrs. Fellows Bros., Birmingham, where 140 chain examiners and labourers put forward a claim for the 12$ per cent, bonus. The firm have agreed to pay the bonus, and work was resumed on the 10th; it is, however, anticipated that all examiners and labourers in the chain trade are likely to cease work unless payment of the bonus is granted to them.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 2,419 workpeople involved in strikes during the week ending the 10th April. It is satisfactory to note that the last report received from this Ministry states that there are now no strikes actually in progress.The 12i per cent, bonus still continues to cause discontent, and two strikes are reported upon this question, one at Messrs. Richard Johnson and Nephew, Ltd., Manchester, where the men employed on extensions to buildings demanded the bonus, and another of scavengers employed by the Leamington Corporation, who attempted unsuccessfully to bring out others of the Corporation employees in sympathy. In the former case the men have resumed work pending negotiations.Two eases of alleged victimisation have caused strikes, one at Messrs. Barr and Stroud, Ltd., Glasgow, and the other at Messrs. W. Jessop and Sons, Halifax. The former case is to be brought before a Munitions Tribunal, and in the latter the men only returned to work upon a threat of prosecution. The introduction of a new scheme of working hours at the National Shell Factory, Newport, led to a strike of all the employees who had not been consulted. This stoppage, which involved some 1,500 workers, came to an end on the 11th April.The War Office Contracts Department has no new stoppages of work to report.Most of the workers at Messrs. Albrecht and Albreeht, Ltd., Leeds, where there has for some weeks past been a serious stoppage arising out of a wages dispute, have now-returned to work, and it seems probable that the dispute will shortly be settled.Nineteen new strikes are reported by the Coal Controller, but in sixteen of these cases a settlement has already been effected.A large number of these are in connection with recruiting. Of these cases, however, all but two were short protest strikes, and these have already been referred to hi Part III of this Report.In Wales two stoppages have occurred, one of which i* not yet- ended, but the total number of men involved was only 860.A considerable improvement has been effected in the local machinery for the settlement of disputes by the appointment of a joint committee, which meets regularly once a week.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Forty-five new controversial cases and 114 old are reported by the Shipyard Labour Department.   Settlements have been effected in fifty cases during the week:Several new disputes with regard to the 12-1 Per csnt- bonus are reported as pending by the Ministry of Munitions.A demarcation dispute has arisen between engineers and coppersmiths at Messrs. Blair, Campbell, and McLean, Glasgow, as to which trade is entitled to fit doors on drying machines. Both parties threatened to strike, but a scheme has now been submitted which the unions are advising the men to accept.At the present moment only two cases tin-eaten to result in strikes. One of these is at the Belsize Motor Works, Manchester, where negotiations are proceeding over a demand for the discharge of all fit semi-skilled workers before skilled men are called up, and the other at Cardiff, where the Corporation employees are demanding a 20s. rise over pre-war rates. This case has been referred to the Chief Industrial Commissioner.
The War Office Contracts Department reports only one new controversial case.This is in connection with the Dundee jute trade, where a scheme of unemployment benefit had been drawn up owing to discharges through shortage of material. The benefits were payable from the 14th March to workers discharged since December 1917. The Jute and Flax Workers&apos; Union demanded payment of the benefit for weeks of unemployment within this period, but this was refused, and the matter has now been referred to the Ministry of Labour.One fresh controversial case is reported by the Coal Controller and ten old; two cases have now^ been settled.The new dispute occurred in Fifeshire, and arose in connection with the method of weighing the coal for which the men are paid.The Committee on Production heard thirty-two arbitration cases in London, the most important of which w*as an application for the general extension of the 12t per cent, bonus to the building trade. Four other cases with respect to this bonus were also heard.Two hundred and ten differences have been reported to the Chief Industrial Commissioner, 87 of which are claims for the 12^ per cent,; 87 of the total number fall within the engineering and 36 within the building trades group.It may be observed that the total number of cases reported during the first three months of the year is 2.313, giving the high average of 178 cases per week.D. J. SHACKLETON.
