April 1918.SECEET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 46.Week ended 6th April, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.On 2nd April one of our large America type seaplanes on naval patrol from Yarmouth, North Sea. when 10 miles north of Vlieland, observed a Zeppelin 30 miles ahead at a height of about 12,000 feet.   The Zeppelin was chased for 40 miles in a north-easterly direction, as far as 30 miles north of Ameland, but escaped.Minelaying in the Heligoland Bight has been continued.R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, employed on naval duty, have carried out a number Flanders of patrols, the following being the principal incidents reported, other than those in area, connection with anti-submarine patrols : On 1st April three enemy seaplanes were destroyed. Three enemy destroyers were also attacked with bombs off Ostend, one direct hit being observed ; and although intense anti-aircraft fire was experienced from the destroyers, all our machines returned safely.On 2nd April two of our machines were attacked by 10 enemy aircraft, one enemy machine being driven down out of control, but our machines both returned safely.An enemy trawler was attacked, and it is believed damaged, off Ostend, four 230 lb. bombs being dropped.On 31st March two of our machines carried out a reconnaissance of Constantinople, Mediter-when it was seen that &quot; G-oeben &quot; had not moved.  . - ranean.On 3rd April the cruiser &quot; Edgar &quot; was torpedoed when 40 miles south-south-east of Malta. The cruiser was fitted with a blister which was perforated and the hull also was damaged, but she was able to proceed under her own steam and arrived safely at Malta.On 31st March at 10.30 p.m. the destroyer &quot; Falcon &quot; was damaged in collision with Casualties. .* an armed trawler, in the North Sea, and sank about 1.45 a.m. the following morning. The entire crew was saved.On 4th April the drifter 2762 was sunk in collision with a steamer, but the crew was saved.On 4th April the destroyer &quot; Bittern &quot; was sunk in collision with a steamer 24 miles east by south from Berry Head (Lyme Bay). The whole of the crew, consisting of 4 officers and 71 men, was lost. The steamer searched for survivors for lj hours, but was unable to pick anyone up owing to haze. Subsequently search was also made by patrols, but no survivors could be found.(0 1083)  Wt.     55 4/18  H &amp; S
ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines There has been a marked diminution of submarine activity nojfcke part.of the enemy operating, this week. From 15 to 18 large: submarines have been located, five of them being of the converted &quot; Beutschland &quot; type, and of these latter two were working off the West African coast, two to the west of Portugal and one was homeward bound. The remaining large boats have again been operating chiefly in the Irish Sea and the English Channel, though towards the end of the week there were indications of impending activity in open waters north and south of Ireland.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and submarines. &amp;\so  he number of submarines destroyed:-	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		March 16th.

The World&apos;s tonnage lost in March owing to submarine action is, however, shghtly less than in February, the higher total figure for March being accounted for by a considerable increase in the tonnage sunk by mine. In comparison with the total tonnage *lost the number of vessels sunk during the month is relatively high, the enemy having been less successful than usual in sinking large vessels.(C 1083) A 2The table in Appendix I shows the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of Losses of losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British merchant British, steamships of over 500 tons gross register; and the table in Appendix II is a Summary ^ t^$^&quot; of these percentages for the last four weeks. &apos; .It will be seen that the form of these Appendices has been modified by omitting the detailed analysis by trades of the tonnage employed and losses sustained in Overseas traffic. The present policy of the enemy of operating closer inshore results in a very large percentage of the losses taking place within 10 miles of land,and the subdivision of those losses into the different traffic routes has, therefore, become almost valueless. The area in which losses take place is now of more interest and importance, but should the enemy again pursue a policy of attacking on the Ocean routes the more detailed form of Appendix will be revived.The percentage of losses to sailings this week, as regards British tonnage employed in Overseas trades, is .83 as against .99 last week. In neither week were there any losses in Cross-Channel traffic, nor is there this week any loss amongst vessels engaged in the Coasting trade. As regards all United Kingdom trades the percentage of losses to sailings is this week, .28 as against .53 last week.
Daily aver-age oftonnage attacked.The following table shows the daily average of world tonnage sunk by enemy action and of British merchant tonnage sunk or damaged by enemy action, or escaped from attack, for each month since unrestricted submarine warfare commenced, standardized by taking 100 as the daily average for February in each case: Month.

The increase in the tonnage damaged but not sunk is not this month accompanied, as it was in February, by a reduction in the daily average of tonnage which escaped from attack, and the figures appear to demonstrate that our arrangements for salving damaged vessels are progressively improving. The growing tendency of the enemy to operate closer inshore affords additional opportunities for salving ships, of which our Rescue Tugs are taking full advantage.ENEMY MINES.Minelaying. The week under review has been unusually quiet from the point of view of enemy minelaying, a minefield in the approaches to Lough Swilly being the only new mine area located in Home Waters. There is a probability, however, that mines were also laid some distance out in the North Sea, and, in addition, a minefield was laid on the French side of Dover Straits.Casualties. The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.	Number of Enemy Mines Destroyed.

In that case the vessel having fouled a mine with her gear allowed the mine to come in to her side, where it exploded causing considerable damage. In two other cases an Otter having caught a mine mooring failed to cut it, but in neither instance was any damage caused to the ship, and both these failures have now been traced to a preventable cause. The use of mine protection gear has also on several occasions led to the discovery of an enemy minefield.The use of Rescue Tugs is having results which are highly beneficial in the direction Rescue of salving both damaged vessels and human life, and it may be expected that the number Tugs, of tugs available will progressively increase during the coming months.

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.Eight German vessels laden with coal have, left Delfzyh for Swedish and Danish ports during the week. J&quot; - hmen
FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.On 3rd April the Germans landed at Hango, the Russians retiring after removing rolling stock and blowing up four submarines which were in the harbour, and on the following day German ships bombarded Lapvick, a Russian naval base a few miles east of Hango with what&apos; result is not yet known.Four of the big ships at Helsingfors were to have attempted to retreat through the ice tol Kronstadt on the 4th April, but it was doubtful whether they would be successful, as no powerful ice-breaker was at Helsingfors to assist them. The sailors refuse to destroy their ships at present, as they have a quantity of loot on board them which they cannot remove by rail. The Red Guards have promised to give H.M. Naval Attache every assistance if he will take charge of operations for blocking the port of Helsingfors should it be found impossible to procure the destruction of the men-of-war remaining there.The Finnish &quot; White &quot; Government is seriously contemplating an attempt to amiex the territories of Eastern Karelia, the Murman Coast, and the Kola Peninsula, but it is possible that-the &quot; Whites &quot; will attempt to develop Pechenga, near the Russo-Norwegian frontier, in preference to interfering with Murmansk. Allied naval forces remain in the Kola inlet, and there has up to the present been no report of interference with the working of the Murman Railway.Two store ships have now sailed for Archangel, via Murmansk, and Mr. Lockliart has been requested to inform the Soviet that these stores will be landed at Archangel, on the conditions that the return cargoes desired by us are forthcoming, that no further stores are removed from Archangel without the Allied officers at that port being informed, that the outstanding payment due for herrings is made, and that the icebreakers at Archangel are put at the disposal of the Expedition.Mr. Lockhart continues to report favourably on the situation, although it is not yet known how the Allied landing at Vladivostok has been received by the Central Soviet.feance.With the recent restoration to the Greek Navy of the sloops &quot; Alpheios&quot; and &quot; Achilloos,&quot; all the Greek vessels taken over by the French in 1916 have now been returned.spain.It has been decided to allow Spanish ships trading with America to proceed with our convoys.jnaval staff,11th April, 1918.[Appendices.
