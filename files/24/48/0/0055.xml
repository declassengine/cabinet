(THI^focUMENg 13 THE PROPERTY Off EI3 .BBITMHIC MAJESTY;S GOVERNS.!&apos;).E C H ST.By Minute 16 of War Cabinet 393 I was requested to settle the question of the provision of supplies for the mobilisation of the Greek Army, as specified in Paper G.T.4241 by General Callwell.After hearing the Departments concerned I made the following ruling(l)    It is very essential that three Greek Divisions bemobilised as soon as possible in addition to the four already in the war zone,, especially in view of the importance of reducing the number of British Divisions at Salonika and replacing them by Greek troops,(2)   The supplies specified under items (a)  (b) and (c) of the above paper should be furnished by the War Office, so far as resources are available, for the requirements of seven Divisions of the Greek Army with adequate depots and reserves; if any further mobilisation took place before the Autumn special sanction should be obtained for further supplies.     These supplies should only be provided for the Greek Divisions in the war zone, and as regards Meat, the Greek troops should be fed from our supplies at Salonika; our resources in meat, bacon, etco, being- proportionately increased to enable us to meet the Greek requirements.Owing to shortage of refrigerated tonnage meat 7/ill probably have to be in the form of tinned meat or bacon.(3)   The extra tonnage for the above purpose should be provid-ed by the Shipping Controllers(4)   As regards Sugar and Coffee, these commodities should be obtained by the Greek Government in Egypt or from Asia, through the French.(5)   The War Office should communicate these decisions to the J?renoh and Greek Governments through the usual channelsoI do not anticipate that these arrangements will involve much -extra strain upon shipping because\ as the Greek Army becomes mobilised and draws upon stocks at Salonika, our troops will begin to be withdrawn from that theatre of 7/ar*MOBIL IS mm   01?
