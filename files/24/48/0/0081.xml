Ttlegrams;-Growmore, Sowest, Londos.BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.To avoid delay, address all communications to :-The Director General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT.72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)V17th April, 191&amp;.Sir,I beg to submit the following report on the work of thePood Production Department for the week ended 16th April) 1918:-Tho Weather.Heavy rains (5.9 inches in Lancashire) and a low temperature were experienced throughout the country during thepast week.Although the sowing of wheat and the planting of potatoes proceeded satisfactorily on light land, the recent rains have interrupted the work on heavy land.Generally speaking, all crops look well, but warmer weather is now required for arable aid pasture land alike.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.Berkshire - The Committee have ordered the whole of the Ladies Golf Course at Sonning to be cultivated for the 1918 harvest. Hertfordshire - The First Garden City Ltd. having protested against the ploughing of 14 acres of land at Letchworth used for pasturing dairy cows, the Committee have arranged that another field of thesame size, which can be irrigated from the Company1s sewage farm, shall be ploughed in substitution.     A condition of this arrange-ment is that the Company shall maintain a herd of not less than 40. dairy cows.Agricultural Executive Committees.Huntlngdonshire - An inspection has been made of the derelict lands, known as Houghton and Witton Glebe, and Mains Land,
comprising some 250 acres in all* which were broken up and cleared of bushes last year.     All the crops on this land look extremely well, and, if the present promise is fulfilled, the first year1!? crop will more than pay for the cost of reclamation together with the first year&apos;s operations.Lancashire -   The duties of the staff of Executive Committees are usually arduous and often difficult, but the Executive Officer of this county has recently had an experience which, happily, is quite exceptional.    Visiting ?/oolton Grove, Woolton, for the purpose of Inspecting and reporting on 5^ acres of market garden land, he found he was unable to carry out his object as  he tenant, who is practically a recluse, not content merely with locking his gates, had surrounded both his land and residence with a barricade of barbed wire.Nottinghamshire -   Mr.Hickling of Wing Old Hall near Oakham has offered prizes amounting to  100 for the best crops grown by tenant farmers on newly ploughed grass land in the Bingham district. Oxfordshire -   The Department have entered on land used for allot-ments at Thame, the owner of which had given the cultivators notice to quit because they refused to assent to new rules which were thought unreasonable.     The Urban District Council have now been authorised to manage the allotments.Prosecutions - A farmer at Beaples Barton in Devon has been fined  30 and  20 costs for non-compliance with an order to plough up land;   in Worcestershire a farmer near Kidderminster has been fined  20 and coats;   and in Monmouthshire a farmer has been fined  25 (with the option of three weeks1 imprisonment) for similar offences. Damage by Game - Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Bedfordshire and Berkshire and under the Rookeries Order from Bedfordshire.Determination of Tenancies -   During the week 9 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 166 acres, and 3 Orders have been made
by the Board determining the tenancies of 134 aares.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Horticultural Organisation - The pre&apos;sent position as regards the formation of Horticultural Sub-Committees by Agricultural Executive Committees, in response to the Department^ Circular Letter of the 19th March, is as follows:-(a) Counties where the formation of a HorticulturalSub-Committee is complete ...     ...     ...      23(b) Counties in which a Horticultural Sub-Committeeis in course of formation ...      ...      ...       12(c) Counties from which no report has yet beenreceived     ...     ...    ...  ...     ...     ...      25Provision^of Land for Allotments -   Reports received from 1,144 districts show that 292,721 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2), and that 265,371 plots containing 19,261 acres have been provided.During the week 32 Local Authorities have agreed to take steps to acquire (in addition to the area mentioned above) 536 acres (7,918 allotments), including 152 additional acres in Bristol, 102 in Rhondda, 44 additional in Kingfs Lynn and 33 in St ockt on-on-Te e s.A building site, adjoining Smith Square, Westminster, has been released for cultivation, and this will provide three allotments for the,London Kitchen Garden fB     Association.The Department have entered on the gardeno    of , unoccupied houses at Lower Bebington (Cheshire) and authorised the Urban District Council to arrange for their cultivation as allotments.Good progress has been made,with the cultivation of allotments in connection with Munition Works.     12 acres of second early potatoes have been planted at Avonmouth, while 40 additional acres have.,been ploughed and harrowed..    The work at Park Royal has been, suspended owing to the wet nature of the ground, the land will be heavily stocked and grazed as an alternative measure.
Fruit Section - The Department have   arranged with the Prisoner^ )of War Allotment Committee for the allocation of 50 German prisoners in connection with the manufacture of Baskets, tut the Scheme Is held up temporarily owing to lack of guards for the prisoners.19 Demonstrations in Fruit Bottling end Canning have been given during the week, including Demonstration Lectures at the Portsmouth Vvar Economy Exhibition.The total number of orders for glass 1ars received from retailers by the Glassware Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions now amounts to 5,279,196   of which 1,152,720 had&quot;been delivered up to the 31st March.TECHNICAL DIVISION,Bill Sheep Farming.    An inspection of selected hill farms in Devonshire and South Wales has been made during the week by tvo members of the Department^ staff and an experienced Scotch sheep farmer.   Inspections will continue for a month and will extend to the whole of Wales and to sheep farms in England as for north as Cumberland.     The ploughing up of grassland has added to the difficulty which hill farmers experience in securing pasturage in the lowlands for a part of their stock during the winter months, and special attention is being given to methods which, either altering the system of management of flocks, or by growing suitable crops on hill farms, would be likely to mske sheep farmers less dependent on the lowlands for winter keep. Treatment of Seeds.   A preliminary report has been received on experiments into various methods of treatment of seed before sowing.    The experiments were oommenced at the end of 1917. (a) Dr. Barbieri-s Treatment.   This is an Italian method in which wheat seeds are sown with a special mixture of substances
extracted from the grain.    At present there is little te choose between the treated and the untreated wheat, though the former has tillered rather more strongly,    (b) Dr. Rosses Treatment.   This is another Italian method, by which the seeds are soaked in ammonium nitrate before sowing.     So far as the experiment has gone there is no difference between the treated and untreated seeds, either in manured or unmanured soil.    All plants in manured soil are ahead of those in unmanured soil, (c)   Electrical Treatment.   In this case seeds have been treated by the Wolfryn Electrical Process, and are compared with un-treated seeds supplied by the same firm.     No difference is yet evident between the treated and untreated seeds, either in manured or unmanured soil.Plant Diseases.     interesting reports were received during the first three months of this year from honorary plant disease correspondents of the Technical Committee.     In the case of cereals, extensive injury was done to winter wheat in Cornwall, apparently by slugs.    Slugs also caused damage to wheat in Shropshire and Staffordshire.    Yellow Rust is reported to be present In Cambridgeshire to a considerable extent on the resistant variety of wheat &quot;tittle Joss&quot;.    As regards potatoes, many records of diseased &quot;Seed&quot; have been received *     Pea weevils are attacking spring&apos; beans In West Suffolk, but in Kent the absence of these pests is remarkable, though larvae in large numbers have been observed in the roots of clovers.     It is suggested that the hibernating adults may have been devoured by starlings.     A special report is devoted to a preliminary study of insects In grass fields near Newport, Salop.    Wireworms were found to be mostly 1 - li&quot; deep in the soil, and there did not appear to be any downward movement of larvae as a protection against cold weather.
LABOUR DIVISION,Soldier Labour.   During the week an additional 742 soldiers wei4 attached to depots, making a total number of 42,309 soldiers (31,396 skilled and 10,913 unskilled) supplied by the Military Authorities for the 1918 Programme.   Of these men, 39,387 (30,199 skilled and 9,188 unskilled) are out on farms, including an additional 846 men sent out during the week.63 soldiers were sent out for training as tractor drivers during the week, making a total of 3,799 soldiers supplied to date for this work.Horses. Instructions for the issue of 169 horses were sent out during the week, making a total of 7,370 horses supplied to Agricultural Executive Committees to date.    In addition, the Department have 906 horses on loan from the Military Authorities. Prisoners of War.   The number of additional prisoner camps opened during the week was 6 (3 prisoner ploughmen camps and 3 ordinary agricultural camps).    These further camps make the total number of prisoners now employed on the land as follows:-Prom 56 ordinary agricultural camps ................5,0120   104 prisoner ploughmen camps...................3,795Employed from other camps.......................... 1,0089,815Released aliens employed in agriculture........... 1,647Total........ 11,46293 schemes for the formation of agricultural prisoner camps are now with the War Office, and it is important that these camps shall toe opened as so6n as possible, as the services of the prisoners are urgently required.     It is understood that the 4,338 prisoners required for the working of these schemes are already in this country, and can be employed immediately the War Office are able to move them to the premises which have been submitted by this Department as suitable for their reception.
In Cheshire a temporary check in spring cultivation and general agricultural work haB been caused by a partial strike of the Cheshire farm labourers.    About one half of the county has been affected, some of the men remaining &quot;out&quot; for a fortnight, others for only a few days.The strike has now collapsed, and most of the men had returned to work when, at a meeting of labourers held in the Taporley District on the 12th instant, the Secretary of the Labourer^ Union advised the men to resume work on Monday 15th April, and stated that they could not draw strike pay.It Is believed that the men were incited to withdraw their labour by the officials of the local branches of the National Farm and Dairy Workers1 Union, which it is understood is an unregistered Union receiving no support from Trade Unions in this country. Old Age Pensioners.   The department have approached His Majestyfs Treasury, with a view to a reconsideration of the regulations by which If the earnings of old age pensioners in rural districts exceed 20/- per week they are required to surrender their old age pension. This has had the effect of decreasing to some extent the supply of labour which would otherwise have been available in rural districts for the work of food production.    The Treasury have now . informed the Department that it has been decided to raise the limit of earnings for rural districts to 30/- per week, and the Commissioners of Customs and Excise have been authorised accordingly.Women1s Branch.Recruiting for the Land Army is in full swing.    The Middlesex Committee have interviewed 633 women and accepted 485 during the week.   Several recruiting rallies have been held and 165 women were enrolled at Woolwich, 465 at Hull and 130 at Nottingham.   It must be remembered, however, that a large number of these women^sre rejected when they appear before the Selection Committee, as, in spite of the urgent need for recruits, a high standard in the selection must be maintained.
The lending West Enft drapery firms have been approached?with a view to allowing recruiters to distribute literature and to recruit In their establishments.    Only one has refusedj others have consented to enclose a copy of a recruiting leaflet in every parcel despatched, and others will display posters and distribute literature.A great rally la being held on Saturday next in Hyde Park/   A procession of about 100 women will march from the Departments offices through the West End to Piccadilly, and will proceed to Hyde Park after an interval for luncheon.In order to make the best possible use of village labour, ;and of,the large number of new recnuits who will be needed for unskilled field work, a certain number of forewomen are being appointed by the Department at a salary of 25/- per week.    They will return to the Department three-quarters of their wages received from farmers.    These women will be required to join the Land -Army for a period of six months and must be mobile.    There is an increased demand for milkers, horsewomen and&quot; those experienced with sheep, and for gangs of women to work for six months.The demand for seasonal labour is constant for short periods of work.    The supply Is at present inadequate and recruiting is, therefore, being undertaken by the Women1s National Land Service Corps, who are again acting as the Department1s agents in this matter *Arrangements have now been made through the National Land Service Corps to send 2,000 women to Somerset and Northampton to pull flax grown under the Flax Department of the Board.    Arrangements have been made through Group Leaders for looal women to weed these crops.
Fifteen hundred women can new H trained every six weeks, apart from those who will be placed in gang hostels. These hostels will be used for testing the rdcruits enrolled for six months who will work there for a week or a fortnight before being placed out on field work.   Accommodation is also provided for 350 - 400 women a week.    A larger number of women are now coming forward in response to the appeal for motor tractor work, and it is fefcped that these training centres may shortly be filled.The Executive Committee in Brecon insisted some time age  that women should be appointed for tfcuotor work and that some of the tractors should be staffed entirely with v/omen. $hft best record in the county   last week was made by a Titan tractor worked by a team of women.   This tractor ploughed 16 acres and cultivated 22 acres during the week, which is equivalent to 03 acres ploughed.In addition to the 250,000 to 300,000 village workers regularly employed on food production, 7,604 women are accounted for In the Land Army as follows.-In Instruction Centres.....................   668On farm work ..............................6,199Employed by Forage Committee ...............   259Employed by Timber Department................. 151Waiting for references to be placed inTraining Centres. ......................... 157Welting in Depots   ..........................  38Waiting in taeir own homes.................. 132Total      7,604Women1g Institute!.   Saffron Walden Women1s Institute has recently opened a Club Room for county members on market days. A market stall has also been arranged in connection with this Institute.    Goat, rabbit and bee clubs are being started.Twenty six new Institutes have b*en formed sincelast week.
MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regards the provision of tractors owned by the Department:-Consigned to County Committees and Tractor Schools up to and including 9th April, 1918      ...Consigning instructions given duringweek......     ... 219Less tractors withdrawn 223,040197150-        *        266 3,653The following types of machinery and implements for use with tractors have been issued to the counties *On offer to CountiesConsigned to Scotland &quot; &quot; Ireland152 114Cultivators, 9/11 tine&quot; Disc PatternPressers       3 ring   &quot; Trailer Boxes&quot;        &quot;    Stones Patent1,190660 196 464 58The following is a list of horse drawn implements consigned to Agricultural Executive Committees.Carts and Lorries Cultivators Disc Harrows DrillsHarrows and Drags PloughsRollers and Pressers1,356 1,428 &apos;784 1,247 2,866 4,864 2,370The results of the Competition for tho Country champion ship Shield for tha month ending March 9th are appended.The winning team has done consistently good work.   Prom August 24th to April 5th, they have ploughed a-total of 662 acres in addition tio threshing and other extra work.   Their average, Including idleness for weather, is practically 21j acres per wec^
The winning county (Hereford) did very good work in March, 40 tractors ploughing a&apos;total of 2,584*. acres.County. Name of Tractor. Acree ploughed.Hereford Overtime 154jNorfolk Fordson 132*Lanes.

Titan 86Appleton Common in the North Riding of Yorkshire was visited by the Departments Commissioner on 5th April, and the following-report has been received:-&quot;Two tractors were working and about 20 acres of the Common are already ploughed, the land is turning up well, though in one part rather stony.   The work of stubbing up the whin bushes and clearing the ground of roots and boulders for the tractors is at present being done by the spare tractor drivers and ploughmen from the Pickering Unit, which has had several tractors standing idle, owing to the wet state of the land.   As soon as the land is sufficiently dry for them to resume work, the need for the German prisoners who are due at the Depot at Sinnington will be urgently felt, to carry on this work ahead of the tractors&quot;.SUPPLIES DIVISION. , Fertilisers: Season 1918-19.   Conferences have taken place during the week with Committees of manufacturers and merchants representing the sulphate of ammonia, superphosphate and basic slag industries, in regard to the terms of the Fertilisers Prices Order, which has been drafted by the Ministry of Munitions.   The prices, and arrange-ments for the control of distribution will come into force on June 1st, but it is hoped that it will be possible to issue the Order by the 1st of May in order to allow time for orders to be placed as from the commencement of the fertiliser year.
Sulphate of iugmonla.   The deliveries of sulphate of ammoaia for agricultural use during March amounted to 28,000 tons as compared* with 24,000 tons in February. . The undelivered stocks remaining in the hands of manufacturers at the end of the month were &quot;very small. Superphosphate.   The deliveries of superphosphate during March amounted to 61,000 tons as against 37,000 tons in the same month last year.   The stocks remaining in the hands of &quot;manufacturers were 50,000 tons of which 30,000 tons were sold for immediate delivery.The importance of providing trucks for this traffic is being constantly impressed on the Railway Companies, and the position is not unsatisfactory on the whole considering the transport and labour difficulties which are encountered.The delivery of Compound Manures has also been well maintained;   it am^nted to 86,000 tons in Marches against 52,000 tons in the same month last year.Basic Slag.   The production of basic slag in March amounted to 42,000 tons, practically the whole of which was delivered from the works.   The production and sale of this fertiliser ;is now very regular, the variation from month to month being insignificant. Lime.   The output of lime is fairly well maintained, the supply available for agricultural purposes being approximately about 50 per cent higher than last year.Binder Twine.   In order to supply the twine required by the Agricultural Executive Committees for use with the Government binders, arrangements have been made, through the Ministry of Munitions, to purchase 1,500 tons of twine held in this country for export.   Orders have been placed with makers for the manufacture of an additional 2,000 tons over and above the supply which has been contracted for by the Ministry of Munitions.   Provision is being made for fully 20,000 tons to meet the needs of the United Kingdom, of which about 14,500 tons are allocated to England and Wales..   It is believed that this quantity Is sufficient to meet all
requirements, and any quantity which is net wanted fcr the present harvest will be available for sale nett season. Se^d Oats.   Orders for the Department&apos;s seed oats are coming in slowly.     Good stocks of Irish Black Tartarian and White Scottish are still available.Seed Maize.   The demand continues to be brisk, and as the Liverpool stock is nearly exhausted, application has been made to the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies for a further 1,500 quarters.1,000 quarters are available at Port!shead, and it is proposed to supply buyers in the Western and South Western counties from this source.Seed Potato Supply.     In response to the appeal for an increase if the acreage under potatoes, several additional orders for &quot;seed&quot; have been received from Agricultural Executive Committees.    There has been some unavoidable delay In obtaining tonnage for the last shipment of potatoes from Ireland, but there is every prospect that a cargo of 1,500 tons will be landed at Cardiff this week. Orders, placed with th*s Department for Scottish supplies have all been executed.The combined effect of an early Easter and a long spell of exceptionally favourable weather for planting have produced many urgent appeals for the immediate delivery of seed potatoes.    Every effort has been made to get the potatoes forward as rapidly as ^ possible, but In some oases the impatience of growers has led them to attempt to cancel their orders and to substitute looal &quot;seed&quot;. Potato Spraying.   1,039 leotures have been given this season up to date. ,    . *Linseed for sewing as a food crop.    Arrangements have been made with a Bristol firm to reserve a quantity of Plate Linseed for sala Specifically for seed purposes, which would in the ordinary way have been crushed.
yeclaratien ef a Minimum Figure ef Gtrminatlan.     It has *een brought to the met ice of the Department that leading seedsmen are declaring a minimum figure ef germination for the seeds they offer for sale, and that they claim the percentages ef germination they have agreed upon are indicative ef geed seund seed and amply sufficient to ensure fair crops.   This is net an unreasonable attitude, but it has been pointed out ta the Seeds Advisory Committee that the Testing of Seeds Order contemplated the declaration of actual test results rather than a flat rate, however satisfactory.   It is net Intended to press the matter this season, as the Trade as a whole is working loyally in the spirit of the Order, but when the Order is revised it is proposed te establish a more definite system of oontrol.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hen. Rewland E. Prothere, U.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
