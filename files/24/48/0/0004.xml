s E c R s mG.T, 4204.THE? slycabikis POSITION. (Reference: War Cabinet 367, Minute 5,)note by lord curzon.On April 9th I was requested by the War Cabinet on their behalf to settle the question of the Glycerine Position.On April 11th I called a meeting of the representatives of the &quot;Departments concerned, at which the various points raised in Paper G.T. 4032 by the Ministry of Munitions and Paper 5.1.4114 by the Ministry of Food, were examined.The view of the Ministry of Shipping is that no expense ought to be spared in establishing fat-splitting plants in India, Ceylon, and elsewhere in order to economise tonnage.It was pointed out that the expense is not so much in the plant as in the raw material, because after the glycerine has been extracted there is a waste product of 90$ for which there is no market in the Bast.Arrangements have been made for putting up fat-splitting plants in Calcutta, but the Treasury have, I am informed, refused their sanction to establishing plants in Ceylon.     The question of fat-splitting in Australia is under consideration.     In West Africa - the nearest source of supply - there are difficulties, owing to the elaborate nature of the plant and the absence of sulphuric acid, which appear insuperable.     The Argentine may afford possibilities and I have asked the Ministry of Munitions to ascertain what might be done in the way of obtaining glycerine from the large supplies of linseed and tallow in that country.With regard to the Food Controller^ request for a Cabinet instruction as to the proportions in which available supplies of oil-Seed should be allotted to margarine, glycerine, other edible and industrial purposes, in view of the assurance, given by the Ministry of Shipping, that the tonnage programme for oils, seeds, and fats would not fall substantially behind the estimate, the representative of the Ministry of Pood agreed that the point had not been reached at which a Cabinet decision was necessary.As to continuing the supplies of linseed oil for linoleum manufacture, referred to in the Memorandum by the Ministry of Munitions, the representative of the Board of Trade said that the supplies would be discontinued.   The manufacturers had been in-formed that they would receive no further linseed oil, and they were going on to other processes which required fatty acids instead of the oil.To sum up, the greatest measure of relief in the glycerine situation is to be found in the establishment abroad of fat-splitting plants, even though a few months must elapse before results are obtained,I have therefore requested the Ministry of Munitions to make representations to the Treasury urging that the necessary faoilit-ies may be given for the erection of plants in Ceylon and other suitable places.
