C. SAGKVIWJB WEST,Haj or-General, Acting British Military Representative Supreme war Council.The secretary,British Section,Supreme war CouncilfA copy of the following telegram was shown to me :-&quot;From Secretary, war cabinet.    W.G, 12.&quot;Yesterday afternoon Tar Cabinet considered question re arrangement &quot;of transport of supply of coal to South of Franoe and feeding of &quot;civil population in area of British Army in the event of AHISNS &quot;being made untenable and came to the conclusion that in the firet &quot;instance it was a question of shipping and military organisation &quot;more particularly affecting French and ourselves and consequently
51 whole facts of the case should be sent as scon as possible to &quot;Versailles by C.I.G.S. and that Military Representatives should &quot;enquire into the matter in conjunction with General Nash and &amp; &quot;representative of Shipping Controller, and tender report to War Cabinet at earliest possible datel . IThere are two distinct questions involved in this matter, namely :*(a) -Feeding of the civil population in the North of Prance in oertain eventualities, by import from England, and(b) Coal supply to South of prance, by import from England.In regard to (a), I would refer you to my minute T/S dated 12th April, 1018, in which I asked that certain information should be obtained from Until this information is avails,ble a reply to the War Cabinet on the subject of import on account of the civil population in Northern prance cannot be furnished.In regard to (b), however, the enquiries I have made are Sufficient to justify a reply being sent to the Cabinet.   It is necessary to consider the question of supply of coal to destina-tions South of the Somme under two distinct combinations of cir-cum&apos;St.ance3, namely(i)   As long as the pas de Calais mines are in working order, and the railway connection ABBEVTLLE-EU-AMFCOUHT is available, and(ii) When the Pas de Calais mines cease to work or the railway connection ABBS*ABANCOUYIT becomes impaaaable.Under th&apos;.&quot; combination of circumstances (i), the output per month of the pas de Calais mines available for distribution may be taken as 700,000 tons,  of which 100,000 tens will be consumed an the area Forth of the Scmme, leaving a balance of 600,000 tons per month to be transported for destinations South of the Somme.As long ss the ABB2 VILLS * MJ * AS Ai? C CURT railway ie available, it is estimated that a third of its capacity for train movement can be allocated to carrying coal, and this capacity should be capable of transporting *4 0,00C tons per month, but in my opinion it is not prudent to depend on mere than 400,000 tons, leaving ?00,000 tons of the available output of the pas de Calais mines as not bein^ capable of removal by rail to destinations South of the Somme.Capt. CAPEL, who has discussed this matter with the Prench Minister of Armaments, who is responsible for the distribution of coal in France, confirms this conclusion, namely that 200,000 tons of coal which oannot be transported by rail must to replaced by import from England at suitable ports South of the Somzae.   It ia presumed, therefore, that the French Government will request the British Government to place that amount of tonnage of coa). at their disposal at once.The combination of circumstances described as (i) is that practically existing to-day.   It is understood, moreover that one of the ccllieriea in the pas de Calais group has already been put out of action, but presumably this will not affect the output, which in any case is greater than the quantity which can be railed South of the Somme.   It ia further understood that the French Authorities are organising a canal service to remove
m 3 **/l20,000 tons of the 200,000 tons excess output of the group to the &quot;ports of CAI-AJ3-and DIr2TCIRK where, presumably, in the course oftime a stock of coal will be accumulated, available fcr removal toSouthern ports by ship or sea-going barge.The heavy troop movement on the line connecting the Pas de talaia mines with the CALAIS-BOUTOGKE-ETAPLES-ABBEVILLE railway cauert at the present time have the effect of reducing the amount &quot;&quot;of coal moving by rail and this, if it continues, may result in the French having to ask for a larger tonnage than that given above, namely 200,000 tons per month.In regard to the combination of circumstances described under (ii),  the demand of the French Government for coal and tonnage will amount to that capable of delivering 600,000 tons per month at suitable ports South of the Soran-e.    I am given to understand by Oapt. CAPEL that M. LOUCHEUB, Minister of Armaments, gives this figure of 600,000 tons aa minimum requirements, representing the amount of coal which industries, etc. South of the Somme have to depend upon sfccsiviiig from the Pas de Calais sources.Both the above figures of tonnage,  representing the extent of the demand which the French Government may be expected tc make upon Great Britain, are exclusive of any British tonnage at present engaged in ;*fa)   Import of British coal on French account, fbj    Import of British coal for British Army purposes, (c)    Import of British coal in connection with the arrange-merits for meeting minimum demands of coal in Italy.(Sgd.)
