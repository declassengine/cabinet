f   -134(this document is the.property og his britannic maj Styts govesnmto),,S ECO g.s,t.-4g53A .  .WAR     CABINET.STATUS OF EIS M&amp;OTSSTY1 S RS^HSSEKTATIYBS INbrazil,, the j&amp;QMC?I3S AND chile. Memorandum by Jar, Balfour,I submit a proposal to raise the status of His Majesty^ Representatives in Brazil, the Argentine and Chile from that Of Minister to Ambassador, and to receive Ambassadors from those threo countries.The Brazilian Ambassador at Washington expressed to me last year the hope that this stop would soon be taken as regards Brazil, and the Argentine Government have on more than one occasion expressed a similar wish.,As we are now sending a Special Mission to South America to mark our sense of its rapidly increasing importance, arid our determination not to lose our political and economic position in Latin a fieri ed, but rather to develop it still further, and to protect it against German competition after tho war, the present seems tc be the right time to make the proposal, at least to Brazil.   It would mark our appro elation of her entry into the war on our side, and on the efforts she is making to render us naval assistance and in ships and supplies*.    Sooner or later and very likely as soon as the war is over we may be confronted with the nomination of a German Ambassador to Brazil, as a mark of reconciliation between present enemies, and as a warning of Gorman intentions to renew her commercial activities in those regions.     We should forestall this by taking the lead ourselves.   Brazil, though still behind tho Argentine in wealth and commerce has even greater resources than that country, and has a groat future before it.But in South&apos;America the so-called A*BaO* countries, namely Brazil, the Argentine and Ohile have come to be regarded as equal in rank, and it is diffioult without causing great jealousy to show marked favour to one without extending the same favour to all three.At this moment we depend to an enormous degree on the Argentine for our supplies of foodstuffs, and it would be unwise to let that Government       think that we placed them on a lower footing than Brazil especially as enormous Bums of British capital are invested in enterprise in Argentine, far more than in Brazil.    We also depend on the goodwill of the Argentine Government in overcoming strikes and other obstacles placed by German intrigue in the way of getting our supplies down the railways to the coast.Vie are dependent on Chile for supplies of nitrate, and the Chilean&quot;Government have not been unfriendly during the war.      T?e have with the consent of the Chilean Government laid hands on her ships building in British yards, and have thus destroyed/her/
Foreign Office, April 16th, 1918.her scheme &amp;  nsval development.   Her Minister in London hos made repeated efforts to ^et us to take some stop, which would show our readiness to enter into closer relations -with her and so to save her from coming predominantly under United States influenceThe whole question was disoussed at a smail conference at the Foreign Office over which 1 presided, and it was, ec.reed that it would &apos;oe desirable to authorize the Mission which loaves on April 20th to rriae the ouestion with the three Presidents concerned, and. if the ground end ciroumstances scorned favourable, to lot it be understood that at the next change in the heads of our throe Missions we would replace the Ministers by Ambassadors.&apos;&quot;ithout some such conspicuous act on the pert of the Mission, its visits to those countries would be in danger of falling flat, end of being less able to accom lish its assigned liission or to make a sufficiently favourable impression.To save trouble I ohall sssumc thrt I have Cabinet sanction for these proposals unless I hoar to the contrary.(Intd.)
