This DocumenttsniannscIdPolitical Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.April 8, 1918.Russia/004.MEMORANDUM ON THE RUSSIAN SITUATION,A.   The   Situation in Russia.The most important feature of the situation in Russia, from the point of view of the Allies, is the progress in the formation of a Red Army.Russian army was still, on paper at any rate, a formidable fight-ing force.    In the summer of 1916 it had delivered a vigorous offensive and its leaders were men of tried capacity.     During the winter of 1916, however, i.e. for some months before the Revolution, economic conditions In Russia as a whole had &quot;been growing rapidly worse and had produced extremely bad effects on the moral of the troops both at the front and in the rear. According to information supplied to the writer by Kamenev, when recently in England, there had been, even before the Revolution, a constant stream of deserters from the front to the rear.     Kamenev further added that Brigade and Division Commanders never knew for certain the exact numbers of men they could rely upon owing to the constant stream of deserters which they were themselves powerless to check.   Kamenev naturally has every reason to paint a very sombre picture of conditions before the Revolution, but there is probably a consideirable amount of truth in his statements.When the Revolution came, one of the first objects of the Sovyet was to get the army on its side.    It therefore lost no time In issuing the notorious Order No.I, which, it is universally admitted, had a most disastrous effect on discipline.   The Sovyet(1) The Old Army and the Bolsheviks.At the time of the Revolution in March 1917 the
followed this up by political propaganda among the soldiers. Though the Bolsheviks joined in the political propaganda, it must he remembered that the authors of Order No.I were Mensheviks not Bolsheviks.   Thus the break-up of the army, which is now placed entirely to the account of the Bolsheviks, was in the beginning very largely the action of the Mensheviks.It-is true that the Bolsheviks were equally determined to get the army on their side in spite of the wishes of the General: They remembered that in 1905 the failure of the Revolution was due to the indifference of the peasant soldiers and they knew that unless they could win the peasants to their side, the Generals would use them against the Sovyets.    It was not that the Bolsheviks wished to destroy the army;   they wished to get it away from the influence of Generals and officers who might use it against their ideas of the Revolution.   In so doing they helped to bring about the complete disorganisation of the army, though of course they argue that the &quot;counter-revoluticn-aries&quot; also had their share in this.   The fact remains, however, that from the point of view of the Allies the prolonged struggle during the summer and autumn of 1917 for the control over the army was disastrous.    The only way to have saved the army would have been the rapid success of one party and the submission of the other - a thing which was manifestly impossible.Had the Bolsheviks had an army which they could have relied upon when they went to Brest, they would not have yielded to the Germans, as they have always made it clear that they were not Tolstoyans or pacifists, but militant internationalists. In June 1917 Lenin stated publicly that &quot;if the revolutionary class seized power, It would conduct a revolutionary war, not in words but in reality&quot;.     It was only the rottenness of the
old army that led the Bolsheviks to demobilise it and form a new Red Army.   Thus, the formation of the fied Army indicates no change in Bolshevik policy, and the fact that they are now intending to use it against Germany is fully consistent with their general statements of policy both before and since their accession to power.(2) The Red Army and the Bourgeoisie.The success of the Red Army depends mainly on the weakness of the bourgeoisie.   Reports from various parts of Russia show that the bourgeoisie has for the present collapsed as a counter-revolutionary force, and it is for this reason that the Bolsheviks now feel in a position to use their army against Germany. &apos;(3) Numbers of the Red Army.There is no exact information to hand regarding the numbers of the Red Army or its actual supplies of munitions etc.     From extracts from the Russian press (e.g. Utro Rossii of March 28 - a Moscow bourgeois paper) it appears that the number of demobilised men who have recently offered their services in Moscow include over 50,000 fit men under the age of &quot;40.   Bolshevik papers are very optimistic about the numbers of recruits, but naturally publish no exact figures.   No doubt reliable information could be obtained from Mr Lookhart.(4) Its Prospects.The Red Army cannot, of oourse, be compared with those of any of the great powers.   An army based on an entirely new system of discipline cannot be created in a day, and supplies of artillery and ammunition cannot be very great.     Nevertheless, for the purpose of guerilla fighting it may prove most useful against Germany, who would be operating.at a great distance from
her base, and especially against Austria in the Ukraine.   The Austrians have gone into the Ukraine very half-heartedly and any defeat there might have very serious consequences in Austria, What is sought by the Bolsheviks is the formation of a nucleus, chiefly consisting of working men whom they can rely upon to fight, which would gather round it the peasantry of those - districts which had already suffered at the hands of the Germans.(5) The Red Army and Allied Assistance.If the present Red Army under the Sovyet Government is encouraged by the Allies, it will undoubtedly grow stronger and will draw into its midst many elements who see no salvation for Russia except by joining the existing forces against Germany (cf. the report in the Russian press that General Verkhovski, Minister of War under Kerenski&apos;s Government, has offered his services).   Once this army is in existence and is strong enough to oppose the Germans there are grounds for hoping that the Sovyet Government will welcome Allied assistance - British, Frenoh, American and Japanese.. The Situation in Siberia.(1) The lack of a strong Government in Siberia is from the point of view of the Allies dangerous, and for this reason the question of Japanese intervention has come to the front.    It is advocated on three grounds:(a) The growing disorder.(b) The arming of German prisoners.- (c) *Fhe need of a nucleus, such as a Japanesearmy, round which the orderly Russian elements could unite against the Bolsheviks.(a) The present situation in Siberia may be compared with that in Russia before the collapse of the anti-Bolshevik Cossack movement under Kornilov andAlexeyev.     It is the collapse of
these counter-revolutionary movements which now enables the Sovyet Government to use the new Red Army against the Germans, In Siberia, however, the Bolsheviks have not achieved so rapid a success, partly because of tho enormous size of the territqry they have to control and the scattered character of the population, partly because Semenov, the Cossack leader, has been able to rely upon Japanese and Chinese help.     The collapse of the anti-Bolshevik movement in Siberia would give a Bolshevik or Sovyet Government a better opportunity of asserting its authority and putting down anarchy, just as it is attempting to do with, some success in Russia. .:(b) There are conflicting reports about the arming ofGerman prisoners in Russia.   Reports coming from Japanese sourcesstate that the numbers are large and that the Bolsheviks aresupporting the German prisoners who are under German officers; -e.g. Sir G. Greene&apos;s&apos; telegram ?f March 12:&quot; General Staff informs me Bolsheviks opposing Semenov are organised and led by German prisoners and artillery is being served by latter exclusively. There is still uncertainty about German officers sent to organise prisoners at Irkutsk, but organisation there is proceeding and will soon constitute serious menace11.And Sir C. Greene5s telegram of April 3:&quot;On March 2V rnd 28   1,200 German prisoners fully armed and equipped left Krasnoyarsk each day for Irkutsk where concentration and organisation are pro-ceeding/1.The largest numbers according to the same reports are to be found in Irkutsk.On the other hand the report of the Anglo-American Missionsent to Irkutsk by permission of the Bolsheviks gives an entirelydifferent picture, - e.g. Mr Lockharfs telegram of April 2:&quot;No officers are armed and all are under strict supervision.   There are a few armed prisoners not more than 1000.   Those men are mainly Austrian subjects who have renounced their allegiance to Austria and have
adopted Russian nationality.   They have &quot;been very carefully selected and are all Socialists&quot;.(c) If Japan entered Siberia without the consent of the Sovyet Government it is true that she might restore order there by sheer force.   She would be opposed, by the Sovyets, &quot;but would put them down and would then gain the support of various bourgeois element a. who would have to persuade the Japanese to stay In order to protect them.   At the same time the Sovyet Government in Russia would divert part of its Red Army against Japan in order to help the Sovyets in Siberia. By so doing the Sovyet organisation would be weakened with the result that Germany could advance and establish an orderly Government in Russia controlled by bourgeois elements relying on Germany.   Thus in Russia the Sovyets would be kept under by German help, in Siberia by Japanese.   Though the accusations against Japan of having an understanding with the Germans do not seem sufficiently substantiated, their interests under such conditions would be the same.8.4.18.---------.....--------
