This Document is the Property ot^His Britannic (V1ajesty&apos;s Government.)lo. 4MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION.ifReport for the Month ending March 51st, 1918.PRODUCTION &amp; COMMERCIAL ORGANISATION....   I &quot;have received from Section II of my Advisory Council a valuable report on the allocation of materials, labour, power and transport facilities among industries after the uar.At my request the Minister of Munitions has agreed that a Sub-Committec of the Ministry of Munitions should investigate the probable supplies and demands for steel immediately on tho conclusion of hostilities.The Trade Organisation Committee has prepared a specimen constitution to be put before the representatives of the Trades vfhen called together for the purpose of electing an Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee.Preliminary negotiations in various industries have so far progressed that arrangements are being made fcr calling the conferences to be held in each case for the purpose of setting up these Interim Committees.It is becoming evident that the formation of these Committees vill be in many trades the shortest method of securing the formation of a properly constituted Industrial Council.INTERNAL TRANSPORT.A. special meeting of the Chairmen of the Advisory Council was held at my request (under the presidency of Sir Henry Dirchenough) for the purpose of considering the best means of approaching the important and difficult question of a suitable machinery for consideration of
co-ordination of policy in regard to the development of the different forms of internal transport.I feel that&apos;a preliminary discussion of such large questions by men of the great practical experience of the Chairmen with the aid of the leading officials of the Departments concerned may throw valuable light on the most convenient method of initiating enquiry or action on many of the complex problems which come before me for review.LABOUR AND INDUSTRIAL ORGANISATION.I have appointed a Sub-Committee of the Advisory Councilwith the following reference -!!To consider and advise on the position of welfare work in industry after the war.&quot;The Civil i;/ar Workers Committee has presented a First InterimReport indicating arrangements necessary for the release andresettlement of discharged workers and suggesting certain previsionsfor shortening the transition period, also a Second Interim Reporton Unemployment Insurance on which the Ministry of Labour Is beingconsulted.The Second and Third Reports of the V/hitley Committee have been issued and are being considered by an Inter-departmental Committee in the light of the administrative experience which has been gained as a result of the action taken on the First Whitley Report,Enquiries have been made in certain areas to ascertain what preparations are being made for the transference from   war to peace conditions.In consultation with other Departments consideration has been given to the position caused by the dismissal of workers from Munition Factories.
RURAL DEVELOPMENT.Section 4 of the Advisory Council are continuing their inquiry into the various measures that it may &quot;be necessary to take in order to attract to employment on the land ex-service men who may desire to take up a country life, with the special object of securing the maximum output of food production in this country,     In this connection the particular attention of the section has been recently devoted to the consideration of the problem, of rural housing.In the ordinary course cf the work of this Branch special consideration has beon giventc the following questionsThe present conditions of rural industries in this country with a view to their possible development and extension after the war;    the settlement on the land of ex-service men and othersj    the possibility of augmenting the production to be derived from cottage gardens and allotments;    the desirability or otherwise of continuing, extending, or modifying the duties of War Agricultural Executive Committees after the expiration of the Defence of the Realm Act and Regulations;    and problems arising in connection with proposals for the acquisition of land by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.C.
