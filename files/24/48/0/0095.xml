Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office.19th April, 1918. Austria/002..TISZA   AMD.   BPRIbH.The shelving of Burian on December 22, 1917, was generally considered the first step towards the overthrow of Tisza. Burianfs return marks the end of the futile attempts to rule without or against Tisza.     It is in fact a return to Tisza and his system, one of. the most complete and most consistent political systems ever conceived.     Its one and only aim is to preserve the Magyar power in Hungary, Hungary^s power over the Habsburg Monarchy and, through this medium, the Magyar interest in Europe -a nation of nine millions, one of the smallest nationalities in Europe asserts itself through it as a Great Power in . the world. In Hungary no one is to dispute the rule of the Conservative upper classes for they, and they alone, are reliable exponents of the Magyar national supremacy.     No concessions are to be marie in Austria to the Czechs, Jugo-Slavs or Ukrainians because this might encourage these nationalities in their opposition to the Magyars in Hungary.     The Magyars must control Austria-Hungary&apos;^ foreign policy - this cannot he entrusted to the Habsburgs who might he led astray by dynastic interests   -v to any people who might fall under influences hostile to the Magyars,     The alliance with Germany must be the pivot of Austria-Hungary13 foreign policy because the Germans share the Magyar hostility to the Czechs, Jugo-Slavs and Russians and have in the Balkans interests parallel to those of. the Magyars.     But this is not to be the alliance of a rider and his horse, but a clear-headed game of give and take. Tisza suffers under no delusions and has no preference for deceptions.     He is a grim Calvinist, a born fighter, a Magyar Junker, a man who will not steal when he can rob.
- 2 -It has been alleged in the press that Tisza has refused to assume the post of Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs himself because of difficulties arising out of the Polish Question. This may be so.     But it would seem anyhow more reasonable for Tisza not to accept the post of Foreign Minister.     Prom the Hungarian Parliament he can direct the foreign policy of the Austro-Hungarian State; he would find it much more difficult to direct Hungarian politics from the Ballplatz.The news that the Hungarian Cabinet has resigned is by no means surprising.     Their position has been anomalous all -the time -they were a Coalition Cabinet practically without a programme except the wish to survive, and yet in a permanent minority in the Eouse of which Tisza remained the real leader.     Thev lived bv his suffrance, and he let them live because he understood the futility of Charlesss attempts and willingly gave him rope.     Now that the Emperor-King has once been reduced to such straits that he has to accept Tiszars man for Foreign Minister, Tisza&apos;s opponents have lost their last raison d!etre as a government in Hungary.     If Tisza wanted to return to power now he probably could do so.     Yet it seems likely that he will prefer that Charles and his political opponents should be compelled to eat their own vvords, go bach on their own promises of electoral reform, work under his direction, shoulder together with him the responsibility for a return to his system - in short, add every possible odium to their own political defeat.     Wekerle may, remain Premier; he was not the sharp point of the opposition to Tisza, but the soft button put on the foil when last summer Count Maurice Esterhazy had to acknowledge him-self incapable of breaking Tisza?s power.     Wekerle had carefully abstained from tailing any part in the violent personal campaign against Tisza which Andrassy, Apponyi, Karolyi, IZIichy, etc. had conducted against him during his Premiership.     On the contrary, on some occasions the two men, though in the past opponents, had
exchanged personal compliments.     Wekerle is a time-server, andshould he now drop Vazsonyi and the few of tho members of the Cabinet most obnoxious to Tisza and replace them by his nominees, this new Cabinet would be as much at his service in Hungarian politics as Burian will be at the Ballplr.tz.
