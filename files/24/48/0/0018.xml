Me^oran^m&apos;-Dy^tho&quot;&apos;OKief secretary.A very grave situation is&apos;arising&apos;&quot;in Ireland over the quest ions of&quot; Conscript ion and Self ^-Govo mment.as to Conscription the various nationalist parties and Sinn Fein;  have aractic-ally coalesced... a consultation is arranged for next week in which the followers of lira Dillon, i*Ir* 0x3rien and^Hr.. de Valera and probably these leaders themselves will meet to devise measuros for the defeat of compulsory service throughout Ireland.   2he Homan priest-hood appears also to be taking concerted action and messages I have seen from some of its very moderate leaders show that this action is likely to be very&apos;comprehensive,I think, passive resistance is mere likely than open rebellion to be the policy &quot;decided upon.   This would,- however,- be no doubt organ-ised by the revolutionary-agencies which are wide-spread in the country. hero are: two modes of meeting the imminent crisis.   One is an immediate and rigorous course of coercion with wile-spread preventive arrests.   Tne other is to secure a Home Rule settlement on the terms of Ireland1s co-operation in the ^fcr.   One conclusive reason for the latter course, to. my mind, is that the former soems to mo impossible as a practical policy..The decision-of a course of action in Ireland is so urgent that; I think the&apos; matter ought to be dealt with to-day.   If a policy of &quot;Biorough&quot; is to&apos;he pursued it ought tc be done deliberately and defin-itely and alth such, immediate action as will make the. situation clear to all in Ireland. &quot;In. &quot;particular-, the Chief Secretary or other Minister to be entrusted with the task should be appointed without delay.Decisions-are how pending-In the Irish Office as to, among   -&quot; other.&apos;matters, questions of possible arrests,: and resolutions with regard&apos;to them ought to be taken before Monday.&apos; .
