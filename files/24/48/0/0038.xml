CMConfidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(10th April 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munitions industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-MAN POWER AND MUNITIONS.Recruiting in its relation to the output of munitions presents at the moment a problem full of complexity and difficulty. On the one hand it has been facilitated by the almost magical disappearance of labour opposition. The lesson of recent events in France has gone home, with the consequence that the &quot; comb out&quot; is generally accepted. In Scotland in particular the chaDge of tone is most pronounced. Easter Monday, which this year coincided with the Glasgow spring holiday, would, under other circumstances, have been a football carnival, to which vast multitudes of workers look forward with the keenest anticipation throughout the year. This year not a game was played ; instead of watching holiday football 100,000 men were at work in the factories and shipyards. The temper of the Clydeside area is further illustrated by the action of the electricians employed at Parkhead Forge, who not only decided to forgo their holiday, but resolved to contribute one day&apos;s pay to a charitable fund &quot; in order to repudiate the feeling that they are indifferent to the &quot; suffering of the soldiers in France, and that the only thing thai: concerns them is the &quot; monev earned.&quot;But if recruiting has been helped in one direction, it has been made more difficult in another. The loss of material in France has rendered necessary an immediate increase in the output of certain kinds of munitions. The demand is so pressing that the immediate increase which is needed cannot always be secured by the compara-tively slow method of increasing dilution. It affords an excellent reason for pressing forward the dilution policy, but the need of the moment can in some cases only be met by turning existing supplies of trained labour to the utmost immediate advantage. These conditions obviously make more difficult the release of men for the Army, and, in the circumstances, the number of men whom it is being found possible to release to the colours is satisfactorily high. The following are the figures of releases authorised for the last four weeks from firms where the recruiting is controlled by the Ministry of Munitions: Week ending 15th March 1918        -        -   3,640 22nd ,, - 3,730,,    29th    ,,      ,, - 7,6465th April    ,, -        -  8,102These figures are exclusive of voluntary enlistments in the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and of released soldiers, of whom a considerable number are being returned to the colours.II.-STRIKES.Statistics for the Week ending the 3rd April. During the week ending the 3rd April, 2,733 working days or g^th of 1 per cent, of the possible working time  were lost through strikes on munition work. At the end of the week, two strikes were in progress, involving 155 workers.On the 8th April only one strike was in progress.A  (33)5576   Pk 20   125   4/18   E &amp; S
Statistics for March 1918. The following table shows for the month, of March the number of persons involved in strikes in each, district, and the total number of working days lost: 	Number	Estimated	Number	Percentage ofDistrict.	of Workpeople	Number of Muni-	of Days Lost	Possible Working	Involved..	tion Workers. *	in March.

More recent estimates will become available shortly.This represents a loss through strikes of &quot;17 per cent, (^th of 1 per cent.) of possible working days, as compared with &quot;76 per cent, (f- of 1* per cent.) in November, &quot;38 per cent, in December, &quot;37 per cent, in January (in each of the last two cases, a little over ^rd of .1 per cent.), and &quot; 16 (^th of 1 per cent.) in February. The greatest loss of time was that of the National Ordnance Factories, Leeds, at which the days lost through striking were 34,666.III. RECREATION FOR MUNITION WORKERS.Lack of facilities for wholesome recreation is now recognised to be one of the causes of industrial unrest. Although a few individual firms have made some provision in the necessary direction, these attempts are anything but universal, and, as a rule, they are limited to the factory premises, doing nothing for workers who live at too great a distance from their work to use the advantages of the factory club. To meet these difficulties a new scheme has been devised and is gradually being developed.The proposal is that in every industrial centre there shall be established a Finance Committee- and an Executive Committee, on which shall sit a number of business men and representatives of labour, and of the various organisations dealing with recreation in the district. These committees are to deal with ah forms of recreation for industrial workers of all ages and both sexes, and their schemes are to cover, and do cover in the cases in which they have already been constituted, recreation halls, mixed clubs, cadet corps, and sports. It is further proposed that contributions to schemes approved by the Welfare Section of the Ministry of Munitions made by national factories and firms (as far as they are concerned on munitions of-war) on a capitation basis up to 10s. a head on all their employees, shall be written off as a working expense for purposes of Excess Profits Duty. A ruling that this might be done was obtained last summer from the Board of Inland Revenue. Similar powers are also possessed by the Home Office with respect to employees not employed on munitions of war.The scheme is actually in operation in 11 towns. Committees have been formed and are getting to work in six towns. In five others the matter is under consideration. Inquiries are being received daily, and the scheme promises to be of national extent.IV.-HOUSING PROBLEMS.As the cost of building rises, local authorities shrink more and more from embarking on extensive schemes, and increased responsibility devolves in con-sequence upon the Ministry to provide houses and hostels. Arrangements have also to be made for billeting munition workers in accordance with the recommendations of the Central Billeting Board ; and in special areas the eviction of workers has to be prevented by the use of powers conferred under the Defence of; the Realm Regulations, t ,  .f These powers have now been exercised in eight centres Barrow. Birkenhead, Birmingham, Coveiltrv, Dartford, Erith, Scunthorpe and Selby. Individual cases of hardship are to be met bran amendment of the Rent Act, which is now before Parliament. ...
The Ministry is interested at present in no fewer than 30 housing schemes, and controls hostels, &quot; colonies,&quot; or hutments in 12 munition centres.Among the housing projects in hand at present are schemes for Barrow, Coventry, Birmingham., Erith, Scunthorpe, Lincoln, Giengarnock, Irlam, Mid-Lanark, Mossend Shirehampton, Farnborough, and Glydebank. At Barrow 500 permanent and 500 semi-permanent houses are to be erected. Satisfactory progress has been made with the first batch of over 200 semi-permanent houses, and labour will be available in about three weeks for transfer to work on the permanent houses. Schemes which are nearing completion include 250 permanent houses for the Royal Aircraft Factory, Farnborough; a similar number for employees of the Siddeley-Deasy Motor Company, Ltd., at Coventry; and a hostel for 770 women employed by the Austin Motor Company, Ltd., at Birmingham.The largest schemes at present controlled by the Ministry of Munitions are as follows : Coventry, housing colony, accommodating over 5,000. Coventry, cottage settlement, 465 cottages occupied. Dudley, cottage settlement, 311 cottages occupied. Birtley, hostels and hutments, 6,031 Belgians in occupation. Scotswood, cottages, 410 cottages occupied. Sheffield, cottage settlement, 708 cottages occupied. Sheffield, 42 hostels, 968 men in occupation.Two difficulties of some importance have recently been encountered:  (1) Hitherto the Treasury have required that, when permanent houses are erected, an arrangement must be made as to their ownership after the war. Where an agreement for this purpose has been made with the local authority, serious delays have been caused by the necessity of detailed examination of the scheme (and of any alteration in the scheme) by four Government departments.&apos;^&apos; An effort is being made to secure a relaxation of the Treasury regulation on this point.(2) it is necessary that an economic rent shall be obtained on at least 70 per cent, of the expenditure on permanent houses. In England no difficulty has arisen, but in Mid-Lanark it has been found that the proposed rents will be 61. to 10L above the prevailing rents for pre-war houses of the same type. Local opposition is strong, but efforts are being made to overcome it by means of publicity and conferences.* Local Government Board, Treasury, War Priorities Committee, and Munitions Works Board.
