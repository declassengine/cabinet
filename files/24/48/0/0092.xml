SECRET.LerCiA-U 228(This Docurn^t is fho PrcoeH-&quot; n?His Br^c MaWtrt Co*f^ &apos;    *       I?Sab^      MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, April 17, 1918.PART I. ACTION TAKEN. Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.The Notice in Shops (Ireland) Order, 1918, dated 27th March, 1918, gives the Food Control Committee for Ireland power to direct that a retailer shall, in respect of any article for which a maximum price is fixed, cause to be posted up in his shop the maximum price of such article, and also, if considered advisable, the actual price.The Meat Rationing Order, 1918, dated 6th April, 1918, sets out the regulations and restrictions throughout the country as regards the rationing of meat, and issues directions to butchers and other retailers of meat.The Potato (Restriction) Order, 1918, dated 10th April, 1918, restricts, except under licence, the use of potatoes and potato products entirely to&apos; purposes of human or animal food. The existing provision contained in the Potatoes Order, 1917, restricting to use in human food ware potatoes fit for that purpose is confirmed.The Horses (Rationing) Order, 1918, dated 10th April, 19.18, reduces the maximum daily rations for horses, and prescribes that dried brewers&apos; grain and bran, which have previously been allowed in excess of the maximum rations, shall be regarded as coming within the rationed cereals.The Bacon, Ram, and Lard (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917, Amendment Order, 1918, dated 17th April, authorises an increase in the maximum iirst-hand prices of home-produced bacon, ham, and lard. The change was necessary, owing to the increase in the maximum price of pigs in the United Kingdom.On Monday, 15th April, Mr. Clynes announced in the House of Commons that the Sale of Sweetmeats (Restriction) Order had been made, forbidding the retail sale of confectionery, unless the retailer be either a small trader, the rateable value of whose premises does not exceed 4:01. per annum, or unless he holds a licence, which will only be issued to him if 20 per cent, of the gross receipts of his business in 1916 were receipts from the retail sale of confectionery.Supplies and Prices.Allied Requirements. Lord Rhondda received a cablegram from Lord Reading conveying an urgent request from Mr. Hoover for two million bushels of Canadian wheat in May, in order to keep the Buffalo Mills working during that mouth and to provide the necessary minimum requirements for the industrial population of the  astern States. Lord Reading stated that if these two million bushels could be provided, Mr. Hoover expected to be able to supply 200,000 tons of flour per month for shipment in April, May, and June. The Inter-Allied Wheat Executive, to mark their appreciation of the successful efforts Mr. Hoover is making to furnish increased supplies later in the year, have agreed to this proposal which was strongly recommended by Lord Reading.Mr. Owen Smith cables that Sir S. Hardnian Lever has authorised the payment of 51,000,000 dollars for the purchase of the additional 60,0(J0 tons of bacon and hams and the 16,000 tons lard.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. Large quantities of bacon are now arriving and n-u expeditious handling on arrival is receiving the constant attention of the Ministry oi Food in communication with the Port and Transit Committee of the Ministry of Shipping, the Railway Executive Committee and the importers.. By the establishment of importers&apos; clearing houses, the pooling of cartage and porterage, the setting up of a staff at the principal ports to represent this Ministry, the expediting of shipping advices from the other side and other measures, it is hoped to secure the prompt clearing of the quays and the quick storage of the supplies not required for immediate distribution.a   (33)0:183-3   Fkl   120   4/18   e&amp;s *
The wholesale trade has made numerous representations against the proposal to tie the retailer to one wholesaler under the revised Distribution Scheme. It is not intended to modify the Scheme as desired by the wholesale trade, but, as the result of a deputation received on the 17th April, if is proposed to limit direct applications from retailers to importers to quantities of not less than 5 boxes a week. Orders for smaller quantities would have to be given to primary or secondary wholesalers. The proposed concession largely meets the objections raised.Butter.-There is to be a butter distribution on Monday, April 22nd, amounting to 25 per cent, of the April applications.  ......Cheese.  There has been a further shipment of 1,190 tons of New Zealand cheese, making a total, of 7,590 tons now on the way. A further quantity of 43 tons of old season Canadian cheese, has arrived in this country, and further shipments amounting to 170 tons have been made. A further 18 tons of U.S.A. cheese have also arrived in this country, and the quantity now on the way is 833 tons. Contracts have been placed amounting to 8,860 tons.Cocoa. Reports from the chairmen of the London and Liverpool Grading Com-mittees show that considerable qtiantities of raw cocoa have been sold under the new grading scheme which appears to be working smoothly. The importations of raw cocoa are, however, still very much below normal.A general licence has been issued to allow retailers till June 1st to clear stocks of cocoa powder and cocoa powder mixtures which do not conform to the 5 per cent, cocoa&apos; shell standard set up by the Order. Meetings have been held with representa-tives of the Public Analysts and Trade Analysts, to endeavour to arrive at some formula for ascertaining the percentage of shell in cocoa powder in order to arrive at a universal standard.Dried Fruits. The details of the new scheme of control of dried fruits have now been worked out in consultation with the various sections of the trade, and it is hoped to issue the instructions to importers at the beginning of next week.Various small quantities of dried fruits arriving from America have been requi-sitioned, and arrangements have been made to release all present stocks of dried fruits on the arrival of the S.S. &quot; Adaiuantos Lemos &quot; from Greece.Meat. Reports on the working of the National Meat Rationing Scheme are summarised on another page. The first week&apos;s experience has disclosed that fewer difficulties than were anticipated have arisen in connection with the distribution of meat throughout the country. It is too early to regard the machinery as having been fully tested, as allowance must be made for the provision which was probably made in a great many households before the beginning of the ration period. It is already apparent, however, that very great dependence will have to be placed upon imported meat, and it appears likely that the estimates which have been prepared of the extent to which imported meat will have to furnish the supply, may be exceeded.The slaughterhouse returns show no increase in the number of cattle coining-forward&apos;, although there is a slight increase in the number of sheep. The March slaughterings compared with March last year show a decrease of 37 per cent, in cattle, 42 per cent, in sheep, and 56 per cent, in pigs. The supplies of imported meat which arc likely to be forthcoming will, however, be ample to meet all require-ments during the next two or three months, and the purchases of the Ministry of Food m North America alone this year already exceed 115,000 tons.Oils and Fats. The importation of oleo and premier jus from North and South America continues satisfactorily.Whale oil is urgently required for glycerine-making and edible purposes, and it seems desirable that sufficient tonnage should be granted for its transport. It may be pointed out that it is more economical to bring whale oil than to bring, for example, linseed, for although the journey for whale oil is 10 per cent, longer than that for linseed, 100 per cent, of fat is obtained on the former against only 35 per cent, on the latter.Tea. A meeting has been held with the Distribution Sub-Committee of the Tea Advisory Committee to discuss the abolition of the present system of distribution which is arranged on the basis of suppbes in the year ending the 30th June 1916.A deputation of the Tea Control Committee has submitted a scheme, which is now under consideration, retaining the datum period system of supplies for wholesalers.The general rationing of tea has been further considered in consultatiou with the Local Authorities Division.
Consumers Council. Sir John Beale attended the meeting of the Council on April 16th, and explained Memorandum No. 31 of the Wheat Commission. A further memorandum stated that the high price of carrots was considered to be due to three causes :  (a) The comparatively small demand for carrots, which are not a popular articleof human food, particularly when there is a shortage of meat.(b) The fact that greengrocers&apos; profits have been so much curtailed by theshortage of imported fruit and by the restrictions imposed on the potato trade.(c) The fact that the public prefer to buy washed carrots, a preference whichincreases the cost considerably owing to the amount of labour required. This washing is done before the carrots reach the retailer&apos;s shop.Mr. Wise attended and explained a memorandum which had been circulated on the supply of eggs for next winter.Food Survey Board. Local authorities have received full particulars, on which to establish National Kitchen centres in their areas, and a spirited response has already been received. Steps are being taken to investigate the matter of profiteering in hotels. Close relations have been established with the Food Production Department, with a view to working side by side especially on propaganda. Steps are being taken to eliminate margarine from all canteens, hostels, philanthropic huts, &amp;c, where soldiers receive extra feeding facilities, in order to release more fat for the civil population. Relations have been established with the London Coffee Restaurant and Dining Room Caterers Trade Protection Society, who hope to be the central body for kindred societies throughout the country. The Public Services Branch, in conjunction with the departments concerned, and on the advice of medical advisers, has laid down scales of rations for all hospitals, sanatoria, asylums, prisons, poor-law institutions, prisoners of war and interned aliens.Foreign Information and Propaganda. The Director of Military Intelligence has facilitated the publication of articles in the Press on German and Austrian conditions, and useful confidential information has been forthcoming from the same source.Ships&apos; Stores. As a result.of the scheme whereby shipowners were invited to bring over surplus stores in spare store and. cabin space large reserve stocks of meat, flour, sugar, cheese, bacon, &amp;c, have been set up at the various ports. The scheme was only intended to provide for the requirements of ships, but. 1,000 tons of flour, meat, sugar, butter, and cheese are being released this week for the civil population out of these stocks.As an example of the desirability of utilising as fully as possible all space on board ships, the S.S. &quot; Anchises,&quot; belonging to Messrs. Alfred Holt &amp; Co., arrived in Liverpool this week, bringing in from Australia over 300 tons of foodstuffs in their own spare space for the Shipowners&apos; Provision Pool.National Meat Rationing Scheme.Reports as to the working of the National Meat Rationing Scheme, during the first week, are generally satisfactory. Food Committees were asked to report particularly on three points, namely : (1) Whether meat supplies have been equal to the demand.(2) Whether rationing has improved the distribution of meat.(3) Whether the scheme has, in general, worked smoothly in their district.In reply to the first question the great majority of the Committees replied in the affirmative, though the position in this respect varied from one Division to another. Throughout Scotland there appears to have been a sufficiency of meat, as also in the Eastern Counties and IMorth Midlands. In the Northern Division (Newcastle) 85 per cent, of the Committees reported a sufficiency of meat, while the deficiencies in the &apos; remainder were mainly small. A considerably larger proportion of shortages was reported from the North Western Division (Lancashire), North Wales, and parts of the South Midlands Division (particularly AViltshire and Hampshire).As to the second question, there was a general concensus of opinion thatthe rationing scheme had improved distribution. Apart from the North Western Division where cases of short supplies were relatively more numerous than elsewhere, the Committees reporting no improvement in the distribution are very few. In Scotland the replies on this point are practically all in the affirmative. In the other Divisions (excluding the North Western Division) affirmative replies on this point were received, as aa 2-
whole, from 90 to 95 per cent, of the Committees. It may be noted that a considerable number of Committees, which report that the meat supplies were not fully equal to the demands, state, at the same time, that the scheme has improved the distribution of supplies.As to the third question, here again nearly all the Committees report that the scheme generally is working smoothly. In a few cases there are references to delav through the public and the traders being unfamiliar with the coupons or failure to obtain all the forms in:time. There is also a widespread reference to the difficulty experienced by butchers in disposing of edible offal, owing to the unwillingness of the public to give up coupons for this offal. Apparently this holds even where a sufficiency of other meat was not available.The following extracts from the reports of certain Food Commisioners deal with the more important points raised : West of Scotland.-&quot; Advices received from Executive Officers as to the working of the National&quot; Rationing Scheme and the supply of meat are, on the whole, satisfactory. The only difficulty seems to be in the disposal of &apos; offal&apos; which some districts describe as impracticable.&apos; The question of potted meat and pies has also been referred to as troublesome in so far as consumers object to giving coupons in exchange for the limited amount of meat contained therein.   Othenvise reports from this area are satisfactory.&quot;East of Scotland.-&quot; Throughout my Division you may take it that the scheme on the whole is working quite satisfactorily. Minor difficulties will, I have no doubt, be overcome as experience is gained in the working of the scheme.&quot;North Wales. &quot; The large quantity of bacon released no doubt saved the position in some places, but is causing much trouble in many, retailers selling without coupons to get out of their stocks.&quot;North Midlands. &quot; There would appear to be some inequality of distri-bution in livestock in certain districts in this Division, as some districts are getting too little meat of any kind and others too much. This, of course, can be altered as soon as the exact registration numbers for each district are known, and the attention of the Livestock Commissioner for the Division is being drawn to this matter. Otherwise the distribution scheme for meat would appear to be running smoothly throughout the Division.&quot;North Eastern Division. &quot; Generally, the scheme in my Division has worked well so far. The public are accepting it and are apparently satisfied with it. The districts where it has found a less favourable reception have been those which had in existence local scheme of meat distribution.&quot; &quot; Leeds, &apos; Sheffield, Middlesbrough, Bradford, York, Huddersfield and Wakefield all report scheme started well.&quot;Eastern Division. &apos;2 Of the 63 Committees who have telegraphed returns, 3 report a slight shortage, 44 supplies and distribution satisfactory, 15 a surplus, especially of offals which people refuse to buy with their coupons, and 1 (Dim-stable) that their own scheme had produced better results. From information obtained from various unofficial sources, I gather that in most places there was a surplus.&quot;Food Queues.The following figures show the estimated number of persons attending food queues in the Metropolitan area for the last week, and for the week preceding the introduction of rationing :  Dares.	Monday.	Tuesday.	Wednesday.	Thursday.	Friday.	1 I   Saturday.18th to 23rd February	46,316	143,933	131,809	157,223	317,158	542,95318th to 23rd April    -	580	1,550	2.860	1,340	6,210	7,840Of the queues during the week April 18th to 23rd half were for cheese, and a considerable proportion of the remainder for lard and dripping.The food queues which prevailed in large industrial areas before the introduction of rationing caused anxiety at the Front. The Head Censor at Calais reported in February that the moral of the men had suffered considerably in consequence and would suffer still more.   At the request of General Bonhani Carter and in view of the
fact that the Minister of Information was unable to help arrangements were made by-Mr. Walton to send speakers to France and to prepare and circulate leaflets explaining the situation. Lord Rhondda and Mr. dynes sent personal messages. At the same time suitable articles on the subject were published in home newspapers by writers of distinction. General Bonham Carter, has now written to say that the effort was entirely successful. One of the speakers at the Front, Mr. Grattan Doyle, has accepted the post of Deputy Director of the Educational Branch of the Food Survey Board.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions for the past week is 645 a decrease of 239 on the previous week. Out of this number, 550 were successful. 331 were in England, Scotland, and Wales, and 219 in Ireland. These prosecutions were under 46 different Orders, two of which appear for the first time in the list the Ship Stores Order, 1917, and the Food Control Committees (Local Distribution) Amendment Order, 1918.The towns which have sent in the largest number of prosecutions are Manchester and Glasgow, with 100 per cent, of convictions.The prosecutions in connection with butter are the most numerous, amounting to 125, those for potatoes being next on the list with 75 charges.Under the Milk (Amendment) Order, John Davies, farmer and milk vendor, Milford Haven, was fined 50L and sentenced to three months&apos; imprisonment for adding 51 per cent, of water to milk iutended for sale. The defendant also carried a churn of water in the milk cart.At Southampton Borough Court, Alfred Harbut, 147, St. Mary&apos;s Road, South-ampton, milk vendor, was fined 20Z. for an offence similar to that of Davies.Under the Flour and Bread Order, at Sutton, Bendy Napper was fined 501., and 21L costs. In Glasgow, Wolff Linderman, and Messrs. Malaw and Lien were each fined 501.Appeals to Quarter Sessions have, in some instances, resulted in a considerable reduction of penalties imposed for contravention of the Food Hoarding Order.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.The imports of cereals, which showed some improvement in previous weeks, are not, as the returns for this week show, on a satisfactory level. Despite the reasonable level of consumption, the stock is still being drawn upon.The import of sugar has fallen off this week. As is pointed out below, large supplies of sugar are required in order to form a stock large enough to meet the requirements of next winter, when only small imports will be attainable.Imports.The situation as regards the imports of principal foodstuffs for the week ended April 13th is not as satisfactory as for the previous week. The aggregate weight of imports was 170,200 tons as compared with 241,600 tons for the week ended April 6th, a decrease of more than 71,000 tons.Only 70,000 tons of wheat and flour arrived, as against 95,700 tous the week before. Converted into equivalent grain, the falling off was 29,000 tons. The deficiency on the week was, however, mainly attributable to sugar, imports of which at 15.900 tons were down by 50,400 tons, and are little more than half the average weekly import requirements for the remainder of the cereal year. High imports of sugar are essential, in order that an adequate stock may be assured for the winter.Barley imports declined considerably, and no oats at all were received. Maize and rice, on the other hand, arrived in greater quantity. Meat shows little change on the week before. In the case of bacon and hams, imports have increased steadily since the beginning of the year. The weekly average for January was 3,800 tons; for February, 6,300 tons ; for March, 9,100 tons. For the first and second weeks of April the figures have been 13,500 tons and 24,300 tons respectively.Lard imports increased from 2,000 tons during the first week in April to 5,500 tons during the second week, and butter from 800 to 3,000 tons. Cheese imports were only 112 tons, and for the second week in succession there were no margarine arrivals.   Tea was again considerably over 3,000 tons.Imports of oil-seeds, nuts, and kernels during March amounted to 69,500 tons, a falling off of 10 per ceut. as compared with February. Arrivals of oilseed cake were negligible,a 3
Consumption.Meat. The total supplies of meat, home and foreign, at the four principal markets in the week ended April 6th were 5,672 tons, an increase of 889 tons on the previous week, and a total which has not been exceeded since January 12th. The improvement was almost entirely in imported supplies, the increase on the week in home-fed meat being only 48 tons. Compared with a year ago, the deficit in the total was 22 per cent.   The corresponding percentage for the week ended March 30th was 35.At the London Central Markets imported supplies for the week ended April 13th showed a decrease of 510 tons on the week before. An increase of 94 tons in home-fed meat brought down the net deficit to 416 tons. The total quantity marketed was 4,041 tons.At the 59 markets tabulated in Table C the supplies of fat stock rose 24 per cent, and those of fat sheep 16 per cent, in the week ended April 10th over the supplies of the previous week. A year ago the corresponding percentage increases were 22 and 19 respectively.At the larger number of more typical markets from which returns are now obtained, the number cf cattle stalled in England &quot;and Wales increased 10 per cent, and the number of sheep decreased 3 per cent, in the week ended April 6th over the week ended March 30th.The following table gives a comparison from the commencement of this year with the corresponding weeks of 1917 : Cattle and Sheep Stalled in England and Wales.Percentage Change on 1917.Week ending	Cattle.

The only exception is in calves, the slaughter of which was restricted last year. A more severe measure of restriction came into operation on March 18th, 1918, and the high figure for the month is due to exceptionally heavy slaughtering in the week preceding this date.As compared with the figures for February, 1918, those for March show, in addition to the increased slaughter of calves referred to above, a seasonal increase in the slaughter of sheep and lambs. The slaughter of pigs has shown a continuous decline for several months, but the fall recorded this month is exceptionally great. The total of cattle slaughtered remains about the same, but on the longer month the weekly rate is lower.Wholesale Prices.The price of British oats has fallen from 49s. lOd. per quarter to 47s. 2d., and is now lower than it has been since the first week in Januarv. English cheddar cheese has risen again to 178s. per ewt.Irish bacon fell Qd. per cwt. from 190s. 6d. at which figure it had remained steady since the end of November, 1917.
