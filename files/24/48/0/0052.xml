(This Document is the Property of^ 2kBlNpSH\s Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)    16th April, 1918*131 11* MEE8C1&amp;HT  SHIP  CONSTRUCTION   IN   UNITED   STATESAdmiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.I have now, after some considerable time, received, through the American Section of the Allied Maritime Transport Council in this Country, an official statement of the estimated output of Merchant tonnage (steel ships of all classes) in the United States..I attach a copy of the statement&apos; for the information of the War Cabinet, and would particularly invite attention to the column marked &quot;A&quot; which gives the latost forecast of deliveries of steel ships up to the end of August 1918.    It should be specially noted that the forecast is quoted in      &quot;DEAD-WEIGHT TONS and not in gross tons as we quote the output,.    It shows that they forecast 1,746,841 Dead-weight tons, an equivalent of 1,160,000 gross tons, for the eight months 1st January to 31st August 1918*.   We had an official estimate from the United States Shipping Board dated 22nd October 1917 of 3,213,000 gross tons for the wholw of 1918, but extravagant forecasts have appeared in the Press sincethat date giving 9,000,000 and 6,000,000 Dead-weight tons per annum which are equivalent to 6,000,000 and 4X000,000 gross tons..I have never had any faith in the optimistic estimates of shipping which the United States were going to produce,.    There will be some addition to the present forecast for wooden and concrete ships, but Iimagine there is nothing very considerable to add under these heads.    Indeed, it appears as if American
1 901 0 kShipbuilding, like the Americafc Army, is being laid out for a very long war.   It is noteworthy in this connection that at the end of last June the British orders for American built ships amounted to over 1,000,000 Dead-weight tons equivalent to 660,000 tons gross, the bulk Ming for delivery in 1918, and the documents I have received show that the Americans onlv expect 581.000 Dead-weight tons, or 254,000 gross tons, to mature by the end of August from new contracts which they themselves have placed,.Fro? the   estimate new submitted it seems clear we nay consider ourselves fortunate if the American output exceeds the forecast of United Kingdom output in 1918, viz: 1,800,000 gross tons.     That is the figure which I included for American output in arriving at my estimate of the date when World construction would overtake World lossesBMy object in putting forward this paper is -1B    To acquaint the War Cabinet of the latest reduced forecast of American output,,2,     To suggest that, as in Fan Power, the WarCabinet should wire in no uncertain terms to Lord Reading asking him to bring the matter of the extreme ursreney ftji? shipbuilding before the President personally,3.     To show the need to the Cabinet, if indeed that be necessary, for more men for our shipyards to ,maintain and increase our forecast output for 1918.In this last connection,I am reporting on another paper as to the number of pen in shipyards.   It does not appear that the rate of increase In   Shipyard Labour is being maintained,(sed)    ERIC OEDDSS.16th April 1918.
