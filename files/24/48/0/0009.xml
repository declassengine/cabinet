(1)10th April, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 9th April, 1918:-The Weather.The rains which have fallen all over the country during the past week, have proved most beneficial to corn and grass land alike, without retarding the progress of cultivation to any serious extent.   Potato planting is now in full owing, and special efforts are being made by growers to increase their acreage under this crop.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Cambridgeshire - The Committee have taken pessession of a farm ef 230 acres at Waterbeach Fen, the whole of which used to be let out for grazing.   150 acres of this land which is suitable for corn growing are being broken up for the 1918 harvest, and a camp for prisoner ploughmen will be established near by as soon as possible to facilitate the cultivation of this and neighbouring lands. Gloucestershire - The Committee have arranged for the breaking up of 40 acres of the Cheltenham Polo Club ground. Sussex, East - The question of cultivating land in the catchment area of the Eastbourne Waterworks Company has been the subject of discussion for some time between the Executive Committee, the Company and the Department, the Company taking objection on the
ground of possible pollution of their supply.   It is now reported that they have ploughed up 228 acres of crass on their farms and are dressing the land v/ith sulphate of ammonia. jYorkshire, East Riding - A farm of 160 acres at Skipsea occupied by the owner has been under observation for more than a year.   The owner has failed to comply with the requirements of a notice served upon him by the Executive Committee in July 1917, and the Committee have now been authorised to take possession and to let the farm to a competent tenant.Drainage of Land - The Bedfordshire Committee are serving notices upon occupiers for the cleansing of farm and field drains in Turvey, Lidlington and Heath and Reach.   In Cheshire the Marbury and Plckmere Meres on Lord Barrymore&apos;s estate were recently inspected on behalf of this Department and certain substantial works were recommended in order to improve the flow of water in the channel between the two meres and in the outfall channels   Lord Barrymore, on receipt of the report, has voluntarily undertaken the carrying out of these works.   The North Riding Executive Committee are endeavouring to arrange with the owners of adjoining land a scheme for improving the drainage around Scmerwater L&amp;ka.   They have also taken in hand the cleansing of numerous becks.   The East Riding Committee continue to deal with fresh channels discharging into the Humber, and are now about te undertake the cleansing of the Crabley and Skelfleet Creeks on the foreshore of the Humber which form the outlet of drainage channels on the higher land.   This work is being undertaken with the acquiescence of the Harbours Department of the Board of Trade.   The West Riding Committee are commencing action under Para, (h) of Regulation 2M for the cleansing of a length of the River Don between Thome and Newbridge, which forms the outlet for the channels of various drainage authorities and effects the drainage of a very wide area, although it is itself not within the jurisdiction of any authority.   The %
Kesteven Committee are issuing orders for the cleansing of channels in Thurlby, Horbing and other fens.Prosecutions - A farmer at Great Glenham in East Suffolk was fined  10 and oosts for failure to break up three fields, and in East Sussex a farmer was fined  15 and  5 costs for failure to comply with an order served upon him.   In Pembrokeshire two farmers have each been fined  20 for failure to comply with orders served upon them.Determination of Tenancies - Itorlng the week 9 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 1,233 aores, and 5 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 123 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Provision of Land for Allotments - Reports received from 1,143 districts show that 284,536 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2), and that 257,627 plots containing 18,807 aores have been provided.The Department have entered on the gardens of unoccupied houses at Finchley and Wandsworth in the metropolitan area and at Usk in Monmouthshire.During the week 20 Local Authorities have agreed to acquire 628 acres of land for 13,127 allotments, in addition to those mentioned in a previous paragraph.   This includes 50 additional acres at Newport, Monmouthshire, 33 additional acres at Halifax, 106 additional acres at Hull, and 265 acres under the London County Council.   The latter body had previously decided to provide 20O]  aores in the London Parks for allotments, of which 184 acres had already been sub-divided into allotments.   The total area therefore of such land under allotments in London will now amount to 465^ acres, or approximately one-ninth of the total acreage of the Parks.At Bungay, Suffolk, a private landowner has agreed to
sub-divide 2 acres of land into 32 allotments to meet the local demand *Land round -Munition 7/orks - The Department1 s Inspector has advised the Director of the Park Royal Munition Works as to the best methods of utilising the land during the coming summer.   A start has also been made towards preparing land for crops at the Union Infirmary, Hendon.Y.M.CA. Huts. - A Technioal Adviser is visiting these huts in order to advise as to the best methods of growing crops on the adjacent land, and ag a result cultivation has already commenced at various centres in the south.Preservation of Fruit and Vegetables - During the last two weeks 82 Demonstrations in Bottling and Canning have been given by the Department1s Instructors.A course of training in Bottling and Canning was commenced at these offices on the 3rd inst. and will be continued till the end of the month.   This course is to be attended by all candidates who may be nominated for the post of Instructor by the County Horticultural Sub-Committees, and who on completion of their course of training and subject to their passing a test examination, will be appointed as Instructors in the various counties during the coming season.Glass Jars for Fruit Preservation - The total number of orders for jars received by the Ministry of Food up to March 30th is 2,395, a total of 5,231,160 jars.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Damage to Crops by Fumes.   With the concurrence of the Ministry of munitions, a visit was paid to a metals&apos; extraction works In Glamorganshire to enquire into complaints of damage te crops by fumes.   The output from the works has recently been decreased, thvJ lessening the danger from the fumes, but it appears to be the general
opinion amongst farmers in the neighbourhood that considerable loss is still caused to farm and garden crops.     The works in question are the only workg in the district not fitted with condensing chambers; but it has not yet been established that this is the sole cause of the trouble.    Nothing, however, can be done now to safeguard this year^ crops unless the works are shut.    The Executive Committee have been asked to make known to the complainants that the owners of the works have given an undertaking not to increase the volume of fumes at present emitted, and to endeavour to induce the cultivators of the district to take the risk nnd put as much land as possible under crops.   It is hoped to make a fuller enquiry into the matter, during the summer, with a view to definite action for next season..Wlreworms and Soli Insecticides.. Work on this subject which is in progress at Rothamstead falls under three headings:- (1) The life history and habits of several, species of &quot;wlreworm&quot; are being elucidated in order that responsibility may be duly fixed and, if possible, suitable control measures taken against the injurious species at the weak point in its life history.   (2) Pot and field experiments have been made with substances which have been claimed as effective control agents, in the past, and with by-products and other readily available substances likely to possess toxic properties (3) The effect on wlreworms of substances containing various chemical groups is being ascertained with a view to obtaining reliable data for the building up of specifications for insecticides. Seed Testing Station.   The number of s-jnples received daily at the Station has considerably declined with the advent of the sowing season. &apos; It is interesting to note that samples of barley and oats are still coming to hand from the Western Counties, and seedsmen are continuing to send specimens of- roots and clovers to the Station.     Nearly 7;000 samples have been received up-to-date. Arrangements are being made for equipping the further accommodation of the Station in readiness for next season.
LABOUR DIVISION. jThe Ministry of National Service, after consultation with this Department, has Issued a. circular letter to its Regional Representatives on the question of providing substitutes for Grade 1 men who are still engaged in agriculture, out who could be made available for Military Service upon the provision of substitutes. It has been arranged that the Deputy Director of Labour Supply shall get into touch with the County Agricultural Executive Committees with a view to their indicating the individual men whom they would be prepared to release for Military Service upon the provision of adequate substitutes.     On receipt of such information the employers of such men will be communicated with with a view to ascertaining the names of soldiers of low medical category in the Home Forces formerly in their employment whom they would be prepared to accept in substitution.     It Is understood that men serving in Agricultural Companies will not be offered In substitution The Department have communicated with their County Agricultural Executive Committees asking them to co-operate cordially In this scheme.Soldier Labour.     The number of soldiers attached to Depots to date by the Military Authorities for the 1918 Programme is 41,567 (30,595 skilled and 10,972 unskilled).     Of these men 38,541 (29,417 skilled and 9,124 unskilled) are out on farms including an additional 1,723 men sent out during the week.     The Department have now been supplied by the Military Authorities with the full allotment of soldiers whom the War Cabinet decided on the 27th June last were to be made available for agricultural work in England and Wales.A further 110 soldiers were sent out for training a3 tractor drivers during the week, making a total of 3,736 such     41 men supplied to date.
Horses.    Orders for the issue of 206 horses were given during the week, making a total of 7,201 horses supplied to Agricultural Executive Committees.     In addition 906 horses are on loan from the Military Authorities.Prisoners of War.   The information received during the week thatadditional prisoners are now available for work in this countryenables the Department to proceed with 50 schemes which had beenprepared and for which prisoners were urgently required.     Allthese schemes have now been forwarded to the War Office, makinga total of 89 schemes now with the Military Authorities providingfor the employment in agriculture of 4,006 additional prisoners.Of.these It is understood that 2,600 will be allotted to foodproduction Immediately.&apos;A-&apos;further 10 prisoner camps (8 prisoner ploughmen campsand 2 ordinary agricultural camps) were opened during the week,making the total number of prisoners now employed on the landas followsj-From 53 ordinary agricultural camps 5,092 From 101 prisoner ploughmen camps . 3,667 Employed from other camps    . 1,0089,767Released aliens employed inagriculture 1,647&apos;   &quot; &apos;   &apos;  &apos; Total      11,414-gOJSBgjSL BRANCH. &apos; : Recruiting for-the further 30,000 women needed for the Land Army is now, In full swing.    Appeals have appeared in most of the principal newspapers, and several clergy, -including the Bishop of London, have made appeals.
As a result of press notices relating to the need for further recruits for the Land Army 130 applicants have been interviewed at Headquarters and 650 letters of enquiry have been received.   Recruiting rallies have been arranged for the next few weeks at Dorking Nottingham, Portsmouth, Basingstoke, Leicester, Cardiff,   Shrewsbury  Zork and Scarborough.     The returns show that 803 enrolment forms have been signed in London since March 25th.The Dilution Officers have been instructed by the Ministry of Munitions, to give all available Information to this Department with regard to the discharge of women from munition factories, in order that arrangements may be made in advance of such discharges to appeal to the women to take up work on the land.There are at present several vacancies at training centres:   9 in Hertford, 8 in Criccieth, 10 in Cornwall and several in Derbyshire.   An excellent centre to take 20 has been placed at the disposal of the Department in Kirk-Langley in Derbyshire.   Lady Canning hasv*ffered the use tf a large house with land and farm buildings attached at Abergavenny, which It is hoped may be used as a Training Centre for Herefordshire and South Wales.   A further Centre.for 12 women is being opened at Compton Vallance In Cornwall.A good report has been received of the ploughing centre at Market Drayton in Oxfordshire, where 12 women are being trained with special attention to horse ploughing.     The instruction and work have proved so valuable that another house is to be furnished:te enable a further is women to be trained.
MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.

Although idle for one day on account of bad weather, one Fords on cultivated 150 acres during the week ending March 29th.Norfolk.   Titan tractor No.5112 with 3-furrow Ransome plough ploughed and cross-cut 41 acres of two horse land in 69 hours, consuming 6 pints of petrol, (.14 pints per acre), and 107 gallons paraffin, (2,61 gallons per acre).oxford.   The Bicester unit of five tractors ploughed 100 acres and oultivated 197 acres during the.week ending March 29th, which is equivalent to an average of 33 acres ploughed per tractor.Fords on   Tract ors. in view of the large numbers of Fords on Tractors already in this country and the still larger numbers which will be arriving shortly, it is satisfactory to be able to report that the accounts received so far as to the work of the tractors of this type already in the hands of cotinty committees are most
favourable.     These reports fully justify the high expectations of the experts who reported on the work of these tractors previous^ to the Department placing orders for their manufacture on a large scale..A. demonstration, and. trial..of the Ford tractor was held at Harper Adams College on the 15th February, and all members of the Agricultural Executive Committee who attended were loud in their praises of the work done by the tractor.-   The report received drew attention to the fact that the driver of this type controls both plough and tractor, and that the&quot; demonstrator in this instance was a woman.     The light weight, i.e. 22 cwt. was also favourably commented on.     It was agreed unanimously that the Ford tractor is handy and economical and a great step in advance of all other light mechanical traction.     The Committee expressed the hope that they might have many of these machines at work as soon as possible.Other reports state:-(1) Spring cultivations in the Holland Division of Lincoln are facilitated considerably by the use of the new Ford tractors. Shortly after arrival one was tested on a farm in Deeping Fen. The result was so satisfactory that in a short time nine , tractors of this type were placed on as many large arable farms. All the farmers have asked that these machines may remain on their farms.     The points of this type of tractor which commey-d it to the farmers are its lightness on the land, its draught-power in proportion to its weight, the&apos; ease with which it may be manipulated, and the speed at which it works.(2) The Berkshire farmers agree that the Ford tractor with the Oliver plough is the best machine for ordinary cultivation and one destined to have a great future on arable farms.4(3) The Fordson tractors employed in Wiltshire are extraordinarily well spoken of by everybody who has seen them.
(4) ^he advantages of this outfit (Fordson) have placed it, in my judgment, a long way ahead of all other types of mechanical cultivation for all but the very heaviest soils, where steam tackle will probably retain Its pre-eminence. One Tractor Representative and Tractor Agent informs me that he could sell a hundred at once if they were on the market&apos;. ;*The following are brief details of some of the performances achieved by the new Fordson tractors in the county of Korfolk.

The Oliver Company have been experimenting with new patterns,  end a trial cf several of the best has recently been held on a heavy clay soil in Bssex.     The plough as at present made is adapted for cutting a 12&quot; furrow slice, but in future ploughs will be adjustable end will cut either 10&apos;1 or 12* furrows.     The new plough breasts were tried on both frames, and very satisfactory work was done by two of the new patterns turning a 10,f furrow, and, one of the two also made good v.ork with a 12-&apos; furrow.     The Fordson tractor and uliver self-lifting plough
form an admirable combination.     The way in ?;hich tractor and plough suit each other is shown by the- surprisingly uniform work accomplished, and the adjustable plough, fitted with shares and breasts designed for different conditions, is certain to be popular.SUPPLIES DIVISION. SuperphOsphate -     The Notice recently issued as to prices a*id supplies of superphosphate has elicited considerable response from allotment holders, and it is evident that small growers are anxious to obtain supplies.     This class of trade, however, has not been much cultivated by agricultural merchants in the past, and buyers often have difficulty in obtaining fertilisers other than the brands of compound manures which are widely advertised and pushed by makers. The importance of meeting tho needs of allotment holders will be strongly pressed on merchants during the coming twelve months, and steps will be taken to see that Approved Agents keep stocks ready for disposal in small lots late in the season.The output of superphosphate is well maintained, the quantity of phosphate rock ground last week being over 10,000 tons, the highest figure for some months past.     Owing to railway difficulties, deliveries are in arrears in certain districts, particularly in Lancashire and London.Basic Slag - Owing to action taken by the Department, increased supplies have recently become available at one or two vrorks and have been readily disposed of.Lime -   many complaints have been received as to the withdrawal of labour from Lime Works, owin-5 to the revision of the Protected Occupations List.     If this practice continues a reduction in output is bound to occur, as many of the men are skilled workmen T/hom it is impossible to replace, and cultivation must accordingly suffer. Copper Sulphate -   The quantity of copper sulphate to be reserved   ( for potato spraying has been raised to 18,000 tons end the ivLinistry of Munitions has agreed to provide the necessary copper for its
manufacture.    the actual consumption of sulphate last season was about 10,000 tons, but extra provision is being made for the coming campaign in view of the increased acreage which it is hoped may be devoted to potatoes.seed maize v   the demand for south african seed .Aai2e is brisk,1especially in the eastern counties.     it is hoped that arrangements will be made to release some of this maize from bristol channel ports.arrangements have been made to extend the list of agents to handle these supplies.rseed oats- $he demand for seed oats has fallen off considerably during the last few weeks, but the department have still white oats from scotland on hand, and irish black tartarian at bristol.general licences for the export of cats from scotland have been reealled as from the 16th inst.seed potato supply - deliveries from england, scotland and ireland are being cleared as rapidly as possible.    two esrgaes are expected to arrive this week in cardiff which will clear up the majority of the outstanding orders.wart disease - applications are still being received from dealers, co-operative agents and others for the departments approval of their stocks of seed potatoes for the purpose of supplying eccupiers of land schedules for V/art disease.    the total number of certificate of approval issued is now over 2,000 and it is expected that further additions will be made to the list.enquiries have been received from occupiers ef clean land adjacent to infected land asking whether it is desirable that immune vari*tlea of seed potatoes only should be planted tnis year. in such cases growers1 are encouraged to plant immune varieties, as many of them will wish next year to plant &quot;seed&apos; saved from this year!s cropland it is possible that their land may be included in a new infected area under the forthcoming wart disease of potatoes order.
Potato Spraying -   Army Camps at Aldershot and Warminster have been visited during the past week.Additional arrangements have been made for carrying out potato spraying trials and demonstrations have been held at various centres and measures are in hand by which detailed observations will be made in different parts of the country as to the incidence and distribution of flight&apos; during the coming season.Several consignments of seed potatoes under suspicion of being diseased have been examined during the past week. Wholesale Terms to Allotment Societies.   The attention of the seed trade has been drawn to the desirability of offering special ter^is to Allotment Societies for large quantities of seed.     The Seeds Advisory Committee, in considering this suggestion., strongly deprecated the purchase by Allotment Societies of seed in bulk instead of paoketed.    These societies have not the expert knowledge required for putting up the small quantities of seed required by individual members and the purchase of seed in bulk is likely to lead to serious waste.The retail members of the Committee are meeting to discuss what improved terms they can offer to Allotment and kindred Societies next season for large quantities of packets of seeds, and if the Department considers the proposals equitable, they* will be communicated to the societies.Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt.Hon.Rowland E.Prothero,President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
