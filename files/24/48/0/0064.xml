s-3 m,,3 aBTMB^QSED PROCLAMATION UNDER THE MILITARY SERVICE(Bo.2) ACT, 1918.   &apos;i k%U tellMemorandum by the Minister of National Service.I submit for the approval of the War Cabinet the attached draft of a Proclamation under Section 3 of the new Military Service Bill, which I suggest should be submitted to His Majesty at Satur-day1s Privy Council and be issued on Monday of next week.   The Proclamation withdraws certificates of exemption from men born in the years 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898 and 1899, he, men who have attain-cd, or will attain, the ages of 19, 20, 21, 22 or 23 during the present year, and who are or are found to be Grade 1 or Grade 2 subject to the following exceptions(a) Coal miners are excluded as they are being dealt with under special arrangements; and no useful purpose will be served by varying these arrangements,(b) Exemptions granted on the ground of ill health or infirmity or on the ground of conscientious objection.(c) Exemptions granted to the last surviving son of a widow of whom at least one son has died as a result of wounds recelv-ed or sickness contracted in or by service during the present war *(d) ivien engaged wholetime in agriculture will on y be recruited if in Grade 1; and such a man will not be taken if it is proved to a Tribunal that he is a highly skilled wholetime agricultural worker, who is irreplaceable and essential to the cultivation of a farm.    It is proposed to vest the decision as to indicpensability in the Tribunals and not in the County War Agricultural Committees f y/ho must to some extent be judges in their own cause.    This I regard as of extreme importance because of the popular feeling which has been aroused by the action of these committees in granting large numbers of vouchers tc farmers&apos; sons and others on what are alleged to bo insufficient grounds.It is proposed concurrently with the Proclamation tc issue an Order cancelling all Protection Certificates granted to men of Grade 1 employed in Munitions under the Schedule of Protected Occu-pationc unless they are employed in occupations which are protected at the age of 19, i.e., Shipbuilding and Repairing and Oil Shale Mining; or in the construction of Tanks.    This will not impose a now liability on these men; but It will expedite their recruiting and will remove a sense of inequality which might otherwise exist.Railways are not mentioned In the exceptions,   The protcc-tion of the men employed on railways is dealt with administratively. A quota is being released by the Railway Executive Committee, and it is net proposed to vary this arrangement,The temporary postponement of the recruiting of Pert Labour from, the Ports of* Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Bristol will be continued,I attach a Table showing an estimate of the number of men r.&apos;ho will be recruited under this Proclamation,   This Table docs not include any men who would be recruited apart from the Proclama-tion, but whose reporting for service will merely be expedited.over-
iIf there are any released soldiere of the agec- a/id grades specified in the Proclamation and employed in occupations Vhich a:.*c not excluded from its operation, I suggest that they be recalled to the Colours.
