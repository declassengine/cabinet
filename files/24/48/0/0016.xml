It is evidently only a question of time till the Red Guards are completely defeated. Mr. Wolff&apos;, one of the Finnish delegates to the Western Powers, on his way through London en route for Finland, made it clear in conversation that the Legal Government (Whites) would not entertain any idea of mediation between them and the Red Guards. &quot; Justice must be done.&quot; This was evidently a more vital consideration than any possible results of the German intervention. With regard to the latter point, he referred to the world-wide unpopularity of the German people, and said that their character and temperament would sooner or later produce the inevitable reaction in Finland,- but on the practical question as to how the Finnish people would eventually get rid of them, he was silent.German-Finnish Treaty.]   Defence of the Finnish Position based on Conversationswith Dr. Rolsti.1. The Finnish army was disbanded in 1901, but though there had been no actual fighting between the Finns and Germans, yet technically the two countries had been at war. Germany had signed a peace treaty with Russia, but the Russian Government, having previously recognised the independence of Finland, could not consider itself entitled to sign a peace treaty on behalf of Finland. Accordingly it was necessary from the international point of view that a treaty of peace be signed between Germany and Finland as well.2. Since the beginning of the war Germany has not ceased to inform the Finnish people by means of books and newspaper articles that it was the task of Germany to liberate the various nationalities suffering under Russian misrule, for the reason that although the Allies had proclaimed that they were fighting for the liberties of the small nationalities, yet it remained obvious from the German point of view that the Allies could not expect a victorious Russia to abandon her sovereign rights with regard to Finland, the Baltic Provinces, Poland, and the Ukraine. Therefore, urged the Germans, the Finnish people must rely entirely on the support of Germany.    Now, however, after having Poland, Lithuania, the Ukraine, and the Baltic Provinces at their mercy, and knowing the satisfaction of having these peoples accept direct German aid against the Russians, Germany with great reluctance saw Finland proclaim her independence in m December 1917 at her own initiative and risk.    From the German point of view the situation seemed still more unsatisfactory when France agreed to  recognise  the independence of Finland before Germany did so.   In the end Great Britain, the United States, and Italy were the only countries that had not recognised that independence at the time when the peace treat)T between Russia and Germany was signed.    Germany now urged that in order to be certain of the eventual recognition of the independence of Finland by those Great Powers, it would be better to insert in the peace treaty that &quot; Germany will do what she can to bring about the recognition of the independence of Finland by all the&apos;Powers (Chapter I, article 1)?&apos;    &quot; I regret,&quot; remarked Dr. Holsti, &quot; that the Germans were able to get my people to sign any such insulting paragraph.&quot;3. The clause in which Finland agrees not &quot; to cede any part of her possessions to any foreign Power .... before first having come to an understanding with Germanj-on the matter &quot; is above all due to the German fear that Great Britain and France might guarantee the independence of Finland in return for the Aland Islands. It is, . perhaps worth while to recollect that ever since the beginning of the war the German and pro-German Scandinavian papers have constantly alarmed the Finnish people with statements to the effect that Russia had already pledged these islands to the Western Allies, and this news was spread in Finland with a view to creating sentiment hostile to[367-1]
the Allies. In spreading these rumours the Germans were able to rely on the fact that Great Britain and France consider these islands so important that in the Paris Treaty of 1856 they demanded that Russia should not fortify them. &quot; Whether the Germans really thought that the Western Allies wished to get hold of them, or whether they only put forward this demand with regard to the integrity of Finnish territory in order to keep these fears alive amongst the Finns, I do not know ; but in my opinion it is more a political machination than anything else. Also, I think there is the possibility of a German fear that Finland and Sweden might come together on the basis of an exchange of the Aland Islands for the territory in north-east Sweden inhabited by a Finnish-speaking population. Or it may be directed against Russia in some way that is not at the moment perfectly clear.&quot;4. With reference to the article (Chapter III, article 5) envisaging the guarantee to Germany of &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; rights, this will not exclude other countries from obtaining equal economic facilities. With regard to this and other articles in the treaty, it should be borne in mind that in Finland the sovereign power is vested in the Diet, and not in the Government (Senate). The treaty will require to be ratified in the Diet, and the Socialists, Agrarians, and Radical Young Finns may be trusted to take care of the economic and other interests of their country.5. &quot; Chapter VII, dealing with the exchange of prisoners of war and interned civilians, takes up a very complicated question. We have in Finland a considerable number of Germans who were resident in Russia before the war, but who considered it safer to live in Finland. Some also were sent there by the Russian Government. So also some Germans who were resident in Finland previous to the war were sent into Russia by the Russian Government and are still there. This chapter is concerned with the release of all these categories, but it will be a difficult matter.&quot;6. &quot; Chapter IX also deals with a complicated question, because the German steauirrs captured in Finland in the beginning of the war were added to the Russian mercantile fleet, whereas the Finnish ships lying in German ports at the outbreak of war can of course be sent back quite easily. The Finnish Government enters here into an obligation which it will be extremelv difficult to fulfil, and that onlv with the goodwill of the Russians.&quot;7. In Chapter X, dealing with the adjustment of the Aland question, &quot; the Germans have put forward the same demands as the Allies did in 1856. From that point of view accordingly there cannot be controversy between the interests of the Central Powers, the Allies, and the Finns. The only point which is unjust from the Finnish point of view is the insistence that only &apos; States lying in the Baltic Sea shall be invited to assent&apos; to agreements about the islands, because it is of the oreatest importance for Finland that Great Britain and France shall have the same interest to interfere in the Aland question as sixty years ago.&quot;The precariousness of much of the above is evident on the surface. There is, however, the outstanding fact that the treaty has been negotiated by a Government which is unrepresentative of the country as a whole in that the principal offices are held by members of the Swedish and Old Finnish, (that is, most Conservative and reactionary) parties. It is, therefore, probably but a question of time till Finland finds her way again into the Scandinavian Alliance, although in the process she will have to live down a good deal of hostility, particularly from Sweden.Finnish Claims to Eastern Karelia and Murmansk Coast.   Defence of the Finnish Position based on Conversations with Dr. Holsti.From the ethnological point of view the East Karelians are Finns by race and language. It is in this territory that Dr. Lounrot collected the Kalevala and thousands of other folk-songs. The Finns look upon these parts of Russian. Karelia with the same veneration as the civilised world to-day regards ancient Greece or Troy. It is a mistake to suppose that the Germans excited the aspiration for the union of Russian Karelia with Finland. That aspiration has been strongly in existence almost from the time of the publication of the Kalevala (1836), and is shared by all parties and classes. It is a clear case for the application of the allied principles about the rights of nationalities, for the Karelians themselves wish to be united to Finland. Dr. Holsti referred to conversations that he had with Mr. Lindley on the matter more than two years ago as evidence that this movement is nothing new. He adds thai &quot; the Germans will naturally do what they can to assist us, since if we get these parts of Russia (Karelia and Kola Peninsula) they will say that not merely did Germany recognise the Finnish Republic sooner than Great Britain did, but also the aggrandisement of Finnish
territory will be claimed by them as directly due to German support. If the Allies hinder us from getting food from America, then even the most ardent supporters of neutrality will say that we cannot resist the German demands if they help us.&quot; &quot; The more the Allies interfere in support of Finland&apos;s claims the more it is possible for the neutrally-minded elements in Finland to assert their point of view.&quot; As for claims to Narvik and Norwegian territory, they are not put forward by the Finns.Further, the commercial and cultural relations of the East Karelians with Russia proper have been quite unimportant, partly owing - to lack of good means of com-munication, and partly owing to Karelian ignorance of the Russian language ; the influence of the. Russian church on a naturally superstitious people has been the principal influence in keeping them loyal hitherto.From the strategical point of view the new proposed frontier is better for Finland and Russia alike. If it passes from the east coast of Lake Ladoga to Lake Onega and after that due north to the nearest point on the White Sea coast, this land frontier will be comparatively short. Again, the more the Germans secure control of the Baltic, the more will it be to the interests of the Allies to have free access to that sea, and &quot;this will be easily possible through Finland it&quot; Finnish territory is extended to include the Kola Peninsula and Western White Sea coast (!). There are several good natural harbours on the Murmansk coast, and the present Murman railway can be included with the Finnish railway system with no great difficulty. Further, an elaborate system of canals by which the White Sea could be connected with the Gulf of Bothnia and Finland is also a practical proposition. With regard to the Kola Peninsula we are entitled to compensation for the territory of Kajajoki, which the Russians got in 1863, and for which they promised compensation. That promise has never been fulfilled. Such an exchange would, of course, be greatly to the advantage of Finland, but the Russians could secure all the benefits of access to an ice-free port by- a commercial agreement. Pronounced internationalists like the Russian Bolsheviks and the Finnish Red Government, when signing the peace treaty between Finland and Russia, agreed to unite these parts of Russian Karelia to Finland proper.&quot; (Of. Russian Wireless, 10th March.)
