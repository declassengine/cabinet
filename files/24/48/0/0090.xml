Geo.F.Milne.G.H.Q,., -Salonika, 6th April, 1918.Lieutenant-Gener a1, Commanding-in-Chief, British Salonika Force.
SUMMARY of INFORMATION FOR MONTH OF MARCH,  1918.British front.No operations of importance have boon undertaken this month although frequent patrol actions have taken place. On March 6th one company of the 85th Infantry Brigade attempted a surprise raid on the enemy outpost line S.W, of Hristos.    Heavy fire was opened by the enemy before our party reached his v/ire, which compelled our&quot; troops to ?/ithdraw, since the chances of a surprise had failed.During the early hours of March 8th the whole garrison of a hostile post near Neohori was rushed and bayonetted by a party of the 2nd Gloucestershire Regt-,    Our casualties were two missing.    On the same day considerable casualties were inflicted on a party of the enemy who were ambushed by us near Kakaraska.On the Doiran-Vardar front there have been no patrol actions of any note.   Our artillery, however, has almost daily carried out destructive shoots on hostile batteries and dugouts with good effect.On March 12th, as stated in my last Summary of Information, the 1st Greek Division came under my command, and on the same day proceeded by detachments to the area of the 16th Army Corps by way of the Seres Road.By March 20 th, it was concentrated in the vicinity of Nigrita with Headquarters at Nigoslav, and its infantry has now taken over the portion of the front between Ahinos and Dimitric A portion of our artillery still remains in this sector.Owing to the Russian troops ceasing to exist as a fighting force I was requested by General Guillaumat to extend my left again to the Vardar, in order to relieve French troops who were required to take over the line formerly held by the Russians * This I agreed to and on the night 2oth/21st March the relief was completed without incident.Aviation.During the month there has been a marked increase in aerial activity both by our own and hostile aircraft, raids being carried out almost daily (by the R.A.F.) on enemy dumps, camps and railway stations, whilst on many occasions harassing fire has been brought to bear on enemy troops with machine guns from a low altitude.   Hostile dumps at Cestovo, Platanenwald, Cernlste, and Rupel have been bombed several times during the period under review, also the station at Porna where considerable damage was caused to rolling stock.On March 17th, during a combat in which three enemy machines attacked one of our scouts, the latter was-driven down and fell in Lake Tahinos, the pilot being drowned.In the early morning of March 20th a hostile aeroplane dived through the low lying clouds and attacked our balloonat/
at MARIA!!.which, was at the time preparing to rise.      A considerable number of tracer bullets were fired at the balloon which finally set it on fire.      Later on in the day an. enemy machine was attacked, by one of our scouts and was driven down and fell behind our lines near CERPISTA. The machine was intact and both occupants were captured.March 24-th being very favourable for aerial operations, six of our machines bombed DRAMA aerodrome with considerable success.      57 bombs burst on the aerodrome and sheds, and four hangars were &quot;badly damaged.       Three hostile scouts attacked our formation one of them being driven down and when last seen was falling in cl spinning nose dive.      All our machines returned safely.Other Fronts.Ho operations of any importance beyond small raids have been undertaken by other allied forces.Adniiiii s tr at ive.The SARAlvLI-S TAVROS Decauville was opened on the 1st April, and will be in full running order in about ten days time.The Lignite Mine, which it is hoped will produce large quantities of good quality Lignite, is being opened at DRAHISTA-,-situated in the hills, about 20 miles luWof EI^VrERITII Station. A Decauville is being constructed from this Mine to EKATERIihI Station, and thence to the sea, so that Lignite may be distributed either by the E ATERinI-SALOiiHZA standard gauge line, or by sea route.       A sample of this Lignite is being sent to Egypt, and, if production suffices, it is proposed partially to meet Egyptian needs for fuel.A Light Railway constructed by the French from SPA1TIC0V0 to 0REOVTCA, &quot;near the left bank of the VARDAR, has been taken over by the Railway Directorate.Health of Troops.1.     The comparative rates of admissions to Hospitals and Casualty Clearing Stations, evacuations, recoveries, deaths, and remaining for March 1918 are compared with those for the two preceding years, in the following table :-Total sick (excluding wounded) calculated as a ratio per 1,000of strength.Detail1916! i	1917	191826.0 !	54.2	47.651.5 1	59.4	61.09.9 j 21.0		o   n24.8 J	37.0	47.00,1 I	0.2	0.222.7 j	55.4	59.5Remaining in Hospitals &amp; CC*Sfs on 1st March..
