[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,&quot;     &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; Foreign Office.[April 19, 1918.]Denmark /OOi.MEMORANDUMONTHE -DANISH  ELECTIONS.AS the Danish elections commence on the 22nd of April in the Folketing (Lower House), to be followed by the elections to the Landsting (Upper House) on the 10th May, a short description of the political parlies and situation in Denmark would seem to be called for.In 1901, when the Parliamentary system came de facto into being, through the King&apos;s acceptance of a &quot; Left &quot; Ministry representing the majority in the Folketing, there were three political parties in Denmark. The Right (Conservative), Left (Liberal), and the Social Democratic. In 1905-1906, the &quot; Left &quot; broke up into a moderate section the present &quot;Left&quot; and the Radicals who are now in power.Zahle&apos;s Ministry in 1909-10. which was the first Radical Ministry in Denmark, was succeeded by Klaus Bentseirs &quot;Left &quot; Ministry, 1910-13, and in 1913 the Radicals, with Zahle as Prime Minister, again came in.In 1912, the question of the further democratisation of the Constitution came under consideration, and as a result a Constitutional Law was finally enacted on the 5th June, 1915. By this law the membership of the Folketing was increased to 140 from 114. The age of electors was lowered to 25 from 30, the franchise was made-independent of the payment of taxes, and proportional representation was intro-duced for Copenhagen. In addition, the franchise was extended to women, who, already had had the right to vote at municipal elections.In the Landsting the life members nominated by the King were abolished. There are still, however, conservative guarantees, viz., the fixing of the age of the electors at 35, and the election of 18 out of the 72 members by the outgoing Landstag.With regard to the strength of the respective parties in the Folketing, the figures for the years 1906, the first year of Radical representation, and 1913, the year of the last elections, are as follows: Yeai-. Right. Left. Radicals1906        ...        13        ...        66        ...        111913      ...       7      ...      44      ...      31From these figures it might be thought that the Right have few supporters in the electorate. But a comparison of the voting strength of the various parties shows that the Radical Party had actually in 1913 the smallest numerical following.The figures are: Right, 22.6 per cent.; Left, 29.1 per cent.; Radicals, 18.7 per cent.; Socialists, 29.6 per cent,; and the explanation of the Radicals being in power is that they have to thank the Socialist vote for a large number of seats.With &quot;regard to the elections now at hand, it would seem that from the British point of view7 it is a matter almost of indifference which party or paxties secure the upper hand.The first concern of any Danish Government will be to feed the Danish people, and to keep oat of the war. The German menace lies heavy on the land, and the Government which dared to take up a defiant attitude towards Germany would have short shrift.The writer has conversed with Danes representing different shades of political opinion during the war, and he has found that, although in some cases they strongly criticised the present Government, they were all of opinion that it had proved itself very adroit in the handling of a delicate and dangerous situation, and that there was no reason to suppose that any other Government would have done better-if as well.The present Government have cemented their alliance with the Socialists, as it was essential for them to do, if they wished to remain in the saddle. M. Zahle, the Prime Minister, made a determined and successful bid fcr Socialist support, in the elections by white-washing the Socialist leaders with reference to their notorious[367-5]Social-Democrats24 32
coal transactions with the German Socialists, but it has some significance that, at the Danish Socialist Congress on the 25th and 26th February, which voted the resolu-tion in favour of co-operation with the Radicals to prevent a change of Government, the Opposition counted 156 votes in a total of 378.In this connection, one should note that although the members of the present Government are drawn from the Radical Party, an arrangement was come to, after the crisis arising out of the sale of the West Indian Islands in August 1916, by which one member of each of the other parties was admitted to the Government as a member without portfolio. A political truce was thus established. The arrange-ment, however, never worked really satisfactorily, and, in Jaimary of this year, the Liberal and Conservative Ministers resigned in order to be free to oppose the Govern-ment in the electoral campaign. The Socialist &quot; Control &apos; &apos;* Minister, Stauning, how-ever, remained in, and is still a member of the Government,With regard to the forthcoming elections, the prospects of the Opposition do not seem to be rosy, more especially as it has split up into not less than six parties, but ho forecast is possible in view of the fact that the elections take place on the basis of the revised Constitution (of 5th June, 1915), above described.The one dominant note common to all parties is the necessity for Denmark to remain neutral at all costs.
