General Situation.In attempting to estimate the probable persistence of the present form of govern-ment in Russia, particularly in its relationship to Germany, one or two elements must be taken into account which are ordinarily left out of calculation. Between the Social Revolutionary and the Bolshevik proper there is little theoretical difference, but much from the point of view of method, and, as the methods of Bolshevism are alien to the normal Russian temperament, it may be taken as most probable that eventually the Russian Federated Republic will be predominantly &quot; Right Social Revolutionary &quot; (that is, a union of States of small peasant landholders, more or less socialistically inclined. It would therefore appear important that we should begin to get into touch with the leaders of the Right Social Revolutionaiy party whose general programme is gradually undergoing modification in that direction). With regard to the attitude to Germany, the writer believes that the final decision will be brought about under the influence, and by the attitude of, the one and a half million (let us say) Russian prisoners of war at present in Germany. It should be noted that Trotsky has made, and will naturally make, no arrangements about their return, nor will the Germans either, and for very different reasons. A further element that will ultimately be decisive against the strictly Bolshevik phase of things, instructively recorded by Mr. Wardrop in a recent report, is the gratuitous wounding of the finer sensibilities of the people, in par-ticular of the women, by the attacks on the churches and monasteries. Not that this need necessarily mean any reinstatement of the Church in its old position, for it is certainly reactionary, but the party that has been responsible for the murder of metro-politans, &amp;c, will not, in the long run, commend itself to the Russian mind.Close study of Trotsky&apos;s attitude and actions from the beginning of his period of authority makes it difficult to believe in his absolute sincerity. When u volte-face &quot; the expression is Mr. Lockhart&apos;s-succeeds volte-face with such impunity it becomes difficult to suppose that his Red army, though at the moment being organised with Allied assistance &quot;against the Germans, will not in the end be used as a sort of Praetorian Guard for the defence of the Bolshevik movement, as he conceives it, against all comers. The Bolsheviks will, however, remain in power only so long as it suits Germany that it should be so. The Bolshevik internal policy is not constructive in any degree. They nationalise the banks, and nominally forbid people to draw sums exceeding a very moderate amount. Yet the writer knows individuals who were able in February to get sums of 75,000 and 150,000 roubles by paying commissions of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, respectively to a certain commissary. They &quot; socialise&quot; the land, yet all that is going on under present conditions is a transference, of it to the richer and more forceful peasants. There is apparently a definite attempt to maintain a condition of anarchy, so that in the end the bourgeoisie, in default of all other aid, may be induced to invite the Germans to restore order. One very simple guarantee might be required of Trotsky as evidence of good faith in connection with the organisation of the new army, namely, the expulsion of the German element who have arrived in the country since the initiation of the armistice.Trans-Caucasia.The possibilities in Trans-Caucasia consequent on the German-Austrian advance in the Ukraine have been dealt with in different Memoranda on the Caucasus. A Petrograd telegram of the 1st April refers to active fighting on the part of the[367-2]
Georgians and Armenians in the districts of Batum, Kars, and Ardaghan These hostilities are being conducted largely on the initiative of the National Councils. If the Georgians and Armenians are successful, the Tatars will probably remain neutral, partly owing to Georgian influence with them. If the Georgians and Armenians are defeated, they will find themselves surrounded by Turks and Tatars, and nothing that the Georgians can do will save the Armenians from massacre. The probabilities are that the Georgians and Armenians will be able to more than hold their own, except in the event of the Germans being able to send forward heavy artillery. Any proposals that the Georgians may make at this time should be considered with great sympathy, as Germany is only awaiting the lack of expression of Allied interests in these small nationalities to play the bully and compass the extermination of the Armenians, at any rate.The writer has had an opportunity of discussing the situation with two authorities of standing (Russian and American) who have been over the ground within the last six months. It appears that in Armenian circles (the following information was obtained in conversation with the Armenian Patriarch) fears were entertained, doubtless exaggerated, as early as the month of October of last year of an organised attack upon the Armenian community. The centre of the conspiracy was known to be Baku, where it was being worked up amongst the local Tatars, who are even more fanatically pan-Islam than the Turks. It was stated that rifles were being purchased at 1,000 roubles and cartridges at one rouble apiece, and that the Moslem population was being armed. The signal was to be the breaking of the Russian line. This particular start never eventuated, as the line simply disintegrated. Nevertheless, massacres have commenced in Trebizond and the region of Baku. The Germans sent up arms and ammunition from Aleppo by Mosul into Baku and West Persia. Most of the Armenians are now armed, but it is probable that on the whole the Moslem population is better armed. The Armenians have not come up to expectation in numbers, largely because of the great difficulties in getting them back from European Russia into the Caucasus, and, after all, however numerous they are, thev are still but individuals, and not trained army units. The same authority expressed the opinion that there has probably been a tendency to over-estimate the possibilities and extent of the pan-Turanian movement so far as Trans-Caucasia is concerned. One who was present when the situation after the revolution was being explained to a Caucasian (Moslem) territorial cavalry corps, states that after consideration the reply was given: &quot;We have been loyal to the one Padisha (the Tsan ; we shall be loyal to the ten (that is, members of the Provisional Government).&quot;Practical Suggestions.(A.) Attention may advisedly be directed to the implications in the proposals arising out of the Brest-Litovsk negotiations. According to the Georgian papers, these go far beyond the mere question of frontier rectification between Persia and Turkey, and are intended to secure that Turkey shall have a direct connection with the Baku Tatars and access to Turkistan. More particularly they involve &apos;a claim on the Khanate of Maku in the extreme north-west of Persia and the region of Khoi to the south-east of Maku for Turkey, an extension of territory of which the Turks themselves never dreamed. This means that the cotton districts of the Araxes will gradually pass under German control. It is evidently part of an attempt to secure the waters of Trans-Caucasia and markets which are of the greatest importance for Europe, since, if developed, this region could rival- India in the raising of cotton. At present 1,000,000 acres are cotton-bearing, but the figure could easily be raised to 4,000,000, and further, owing to the prevalence of the mulberry and the great variety of vines, the district will eventually be also a silk-raising and wine-growing centre. One possible way of hindering this control, as suggested by a large holder of property in that region (Count Girard de Soucantou, recently attached to Commander Locker Lampson5s armoured car force), would be to rouse the Kurdish tribes, who in this particular region are not pro-Turkish, and would be against all invaders. Count Girard, who claims to know these tribes intimately, believes that it would be possible with their aid to protect the right flank of the Mesopotamian army. The promise of arms, which they would go to Mesopotamia to get, and a little money, would be sufficient in his opinion to secure their allegiance ; otherwise he fears they will be bought by the Germans. At least it is worth while considering some attempt to get control over them.(B.)-In Urumiah, which is the key position for the north-east of Persia, there is a staff of twenty American missionaries, half of whom are veterans. The leader, Dr. Sliedd, is personally known to the writer as a strong, broad-minded, statesman-like
man, prepared to subordinate everything at the present time for the Allied cause. His staff know the whole region, and are trusted by the people, who would rally round them. It should not be impossible to get into touch with him by native runners, and get his advice upon the situation, which would be invaluable. A series of definite questions might be put to him, as, for example: (a) A considerable Syrian force has been operating in the&apos; field in these regions against the Kurds, which is known to have secured successes over them, particularly in the month of October last. How far are they a military asset? (b) How far can we make use of Kurds who are disaffected in relation to the Turks ? It is stated that in October one Kurdish tribe made overtures to the British authorities. How far can we count on the Yezedis (between Urumia and Mosul) &apos;? How far would it be practical with their aid to attempt to link up with the Mesopotamian expeditionary force at Samarah (75 miles above Bagdad on the Tigris)? (c) What would Dr. Shedd propose in the way of pro-Ally propaganda ? He has a staff with the necessary knowledge of the language and of the people, and is in a position to run propaganda. He could send out great numbers of natives on such work.(0.)-Can something not be done by way of propaganda with regard to the latest Armenian massacres in fixing the responsibility for them on the German Government ? The latter is deliberately undertaking to exterminate the oldest Christian nation. It can be shown to be the result of direct German propaganda in Turkey.(D.) Necessity for installation of wireless at Tabriz and Tiflis is shown by recent exents.Siberia.The following are opinions on the Japanese situation, as expressed by a Russian naval officer (Baron Klodt), who held office in the Russian Admiralty under Kerensky&apos;s Government, and who has lived for a considerable time in the Far East: &quot;As a matter of fact, Japan did not get a very great deal out of our peace treaty in 1905. Their staple articles of diet are fish and rice. Rice they grow themselves, and, as they are keen merchants, they export their own rice and import a cheaper quality from the French colonies Annam and Cochin China  and Siam. They do not, however, obtain all they wish from these quarters, and have tried to raise rice in Formosa, but unsuccessfully, as the Formosans are difficult to handle. With regard to fish: the fisheries on their own shores are insufficient, and under the Treaty of Portsmouth they obtained the light to fish along the East Siberian coast. But the fish ascend the rivers, and the rich fisheries are really at the river mouths ; so, when Russia and Japan again became friendly, the Japanese got the right to fish in the river firths along the East Coast (Primorsky, Kamchatka, Anadir) by definite agreement in 1910 or 1911. A further advance on this was given later (1915) in a right to set up fisheries at any points in the rivers which were deemed most favourable, as also in a right to prospect in a hundred-verst zone along the whole East Siberian Coast, which hitherto had been prohibited without special licence. In the summer of 1916, in particular, Gondatti, as Governor-General of the Amur Province, extended this freely to the Japanese. Accordingly, they enjoy all the privileges of Russians in Eastern Siberia, without any of the expense of government in a region where the cost of administration is considerable, particularly owing to the bad communica-tions. Accordingly, I do not think that the Japanese are particularly anxious to gain full political control over Eastern Siberia. They have large mining fields in Corea still undeveloped, as also great forest areas. If they look afar, in my opinion it is towards the French colonies of which 1 have spoken, and the Marshall Islands. They want bases in the Southern Pacific, and were chagrined at having to surrender the Marshall Islands after locating the German forces there to the British. The danger of a seizure of stores at Vladivostock by the Bolsheviks and Germans does not seem to me very great so long as there are Allied warships present. The fortress is practically, dismantled, all the heavy artillery having long ago been sent to the Western front. Accordingly, even with full control of the forts, they could not achieve very much.&quot; When I travelled back in 1916 I saw very great numbers of Austrian prisoners in Siberia, but few Germans. The latter were intensely disliked. The former proved good friends to the local population. Any married woman had the right to have an Austrian work for her if her husband was at the war. Many of the Austrians were skilled artisans and coald make carts and wheels and articles in leather, which were absolutely unprocurable in the open market.   They are not
keen to go Lack and fight, so I do not think that the Austrians will join the units said to be forming in Siberia in any great numbers. The Germans, ou the other hand, would not mix with the rest of the population. They lived in the small towns rather than in the villages, and were unwilling to work. The local Town Councils were always trying to get rid of them, and said that they onlv ate up food and made themselves disagreeable. The German prisoners were largely in Eastern Siberia. After the Revolution many of them made their way down into China, not being well guarded. The German prisoners in Russia have probably never exceeded 400,000 at any time, and of these the very great majority are in European Russia.&quot;The latest telegrams refer to the formation of a Siberian Government which, if supported by the Allies, may. provide a nucleus round which the patriotic Siberian elements can rally. For reasons given in preceding memoranda on Siberia, this may turn out to be a more serious nationalist and patriotic movement than corresponding movements in European Russia have proved to be, and if successful will ultimately spread there.   But it brings the issue as to our attitude to Bolshevism to a head.(E.)-It may be useful to recollect that some fifteen years ago the German Emperor drew with his own hand a cartoon representative of the Yellow Peril and made a speech against the Japanese at the same time. This has never been forgotten by them. While we are distinguished by a sense of hoi!our, the Japanese have a peculiar sense of pride. They want to be considered a Western Power. In opposition to the treaty-breaking Prussian, the Japanese have never broken a treaty. If there is any distrust of the Japanese it might possibly be met by drawing attention to these circumstances.
