The explanation given by the Ministry cf Shipping is however it will be seen described by the Canadian Government as no explanation, and in view of the strong feeling1 shewn by them I should be glad to have the authority of the War Cabinet to inform the Canadian Government that such measures shall not be taken without prior consultation with Canada.-W..H.L.16.4.18.
March 26th.My advisers have just learnt with much surprise that arrangements have been made without any consultation with them for diverting to New York a large part of tonnage now sailing to and from Canadian ports. They desire to be informed as to arrangements and to learn why the Canadian Government has not been consulted with regard thereto.   The information has reached them in a very casual manner and they beg to record their strong opinion that such methods are net conducive to essential co-operation between tiiis Dominion and the United Kingdom. Any repetition of such an&quot;incident would be viewed by them with the utmost concern.JMCKSEIhl;,Pia&amp;EESASEUTELEGBEUMFrom the Governor-.General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM  From the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of Canada.   (Sent 12.15 p.m. 8th April,1918).8th April   Secret.   Referring to your telegram of 28th March altera-1 tions in shipping arrangements referred to are being made in order to replace specific ships of 12i-16 knots sea speed by equivalent tonnage of slower speeds not with object of diverting to mage from Canadian ports to I&quot;ew York.   Intention is to eliminate delay and deviation inci-dental to making a rendezvous &amp;0C miles from loading port which is inseparable from present system of a convoy alternately running from New York and Halifax by running ships of speed named direct to and from United States ports.    It   is estimated that eight days on each round trip will be se&quot;vied-by this arrangement and grouping ships into fleets of same speed; in other words one extra round voyage in the year will be obtained from each steamer.   Whereas certain vessels now proceed to Halifax: independently and unescorted, the new arrangement will provide for escort of vessels carrying troons for whole of outward and ho mewa rd vo va e:e s .Shipping Controller did not wish to notify scheme officially until question of practicability was definitely settled.   He has been making experiments as to practicability of scheme, and is now satisfied as to this and is anxious to arrange for necessary diversions at earliest possible date.   Fe much reerets that matter should have come to knowledg of Canadian Government otherwise than through official channel and also interference with normal itinerary of certain ships, but in view of paramount necessity at this crisis of securing rapid movement of troops and food eastwards and of saving every possible hour in the turn round of ships he trusts that your Government will readily acquiesce in proposiShipping Controller emphasizes that equivalent slower tonnage will be diverted to Canadian from American ports.    He adds that provision of necessary tonnage for conveyance of Canadian troops is receiving urgent consideration.   Particulars will be telegraphed shortly.LONG.

18488.      PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of Canada.(Sent 4.10 p.m. 16th April,1918).My telegram 11th April.    Following from Admiralty begins:-As matter of utr.nost urgency y/ar Cabinet have directed that con-veyance of troops to France is to be expedited in every possible way.      In this connection Admiralty approved suggestion of Commodore Wells New York, that troops should be conveyed in ves-sels sailing in the medium convoys, that is in vessels of not less than 9i knots speed so far as such ships have accommodation for troops necessary rafts and boats being provided.    This was com-municated in Admiralty telegram 236 of 8th April to Naval Ottawa who replies to effect that it was decided after a conference with Commander-in-Chief and Militia representative that ships of PREIORIAN and LAKE MANITOBA type could not be utilised for troops.    If no vessels in the medium convoys are used for troops the number of American troops conveyed will fall short of what could have been carried, and this is a position that should not be accepted.    In opinion of His mj(rsty&apos;s Government risk in-volved in conveyance of troops in vessels sailing in medium convoys should be accepted and they cannot too strongly emphasise necessity for meeting fully a critical situation but numbers carried in these slower ships will be restricted and vessels will be placed in middle of convoys and given all protection possible in every way.    Percentage, namely, 1.08, of losses of ships in North Atlantic convoys of ail speeds, shews how small is the risk.    In New York convoy only three ships have been lost out of over 700.    In these, circumstances Admiralty consider risk involved by allowing troops to embark in these slower vessels may reasonably be accepted.    Hope therefore Canadian Government will agree to embarkation of Canadian troops in such vessels. Ends.       please telegraph views of your Ministers.LONG.

Your telegram of .8th April respecting diversion of shipping has been carefully considered by Canadian Government. They regret necessity for recording their opinion that failure to consult thorn respecting proposed arrangements is not satisfactorily explained and indeed is not explained at all;    Canadian Government hope in view of this that they may have explicit assurance that in respect of matters so vitally oon-cerning this country his kajesty&apos;s Government will not proofed Upon the principle of deciding first and consulting the Canadian Government afterwards.
