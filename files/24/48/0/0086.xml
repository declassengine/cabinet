6*&quot;* A -    210H Confidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(17th April 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munitions industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES. Statistics of Strikes for the Week ending the 10th April.During the week ending the 10th April, 3,235* working days-or ^ of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on munition work, as compared with 2,763* days-or nearly ^ of 1 per cent, of the possible working time in the preceding week. At the end of the week, 620j workers were on strike, as compared with 155 on the 3rd April.On the 15th April it was reported that no munition Avorkers were on strike out of approximately 2f millions employed under the Ministry.While indications of restlessness are not entirely absent, and watchfulness is always necessary, there is at present no ground for dissatisfaction with the industrial situation, which, as the statistics show, is quite abnormally tranquil.A very satisfactory feature of the situation is the declaration of the national organisation of the rank and file or shop stewards movement, &quot; that the time is not opportune to ask the workers to take any action to obtain peace.&quot;:]:II. MAN POWER.The urgent demands for an increased output of certain classes of munitions has made more difficult the finding of the quota of 108,000 men for the army from ship-building and munition work. Points that are receiving earnest consideration on this question relate to the recruiting from as wide an occupational area as possible con-currently with the pressing forward of the dilution policy, and to the promotion of arrangements by which mobility of labour may be ensured so as to render it trans-ferable at need to those points in the industrial field where it is most urgently required.III.-VOLUNTARY ENLISTMENTS.Voluntary enlistment is one of the difficulties which have presented themselves in connection with recruiting from the munitions industries. Complaints have been received from many firms that their organisations have been affected by the voluntary departure of workers for the colours. It is clear that such enlistments are difficult to control; and it is also clear that in large numbers they might interfere to a substantial extent with the working of the official scheme for releases to the colours. Most of the men who have presented themselves voluntarily have done so with a view to joining the air force or other technical corps in the Army.IV.-SHEET-METAL ORGANISATION.An arrangement has been made with representatives of the employers and trade unions in the sheet-metal work industry in the London area for the recognition of a standard rate of Is. Id. per hour. This rate is considerably higher than the pre-war rate, and has been attained by the men owing to the shortage of the highly skilled class of labour which they represent.   It is a class of labour that has been in urgent* These figures include time lost through refusal to work overtime or through &quot; stay-in &quot; strikes, of which a few cases have occurred since whole-time strikes were practically abandoned as the German offensive developed.f Four hundred and seventy of these were involved in an overtime strike at the light-gun shop of Messrs. Armstrong, Whit worth &amp; Co., Ltd. (Manchester).J Resolution of national conference at Manchester on Saturday the 13th April, x  (33)5612   Pk 20  120  4/18  E &amp; s
demand for aircraft work. In connection with this arrangement the Department has decided to impose a restriction on employers in the London area under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, Avhich will prevent employers from taking on, without the authority of the Ministry, any skilled sheet-metal workers in excess of those in their employment at this date.In the case of individual establishments, the Ministry has previously imposed a restriction of this kind under the Defence of the Realm Regulations,&apos;5&apos; but its use on a wide scale over the whole&apos; of a trade in a given area is new. It has, however, been accepted by the official representatives of the employers and trade unions, and the Department is now awaiting confirmation by the trade union.members, as to which it is anticipated that no difficulty will arise. If the arrangement is accepted by the men, the result will be that the Ministry will be able to exercise considerable control over the use and allocation of skilled sheet-metal workers in the London area, both on private and on munitions work, so that a full complement of men may be kept on the more urgent work.V.-RESTORATION OP TRADE UNION RULES AND CONDITIONS.Letters have been received from several district secretaries of the A.S.E., enclosing copies of an identical resolution passed by their respective district com-mittees pressing for the introduction of a Bill to redeem the pledges given as to the restoration of trade union rules and conditions. The principal point involved is the extension to non-controlled establishments engaged on munitions work of the pledge for post-war restoration contained, so far as controlled establishments are concerned, is the second schedule of the Munitions of War Act of 1915. Restoration in non-controlled establishments depends at present only upon the Treasury Agreement concluded between the Government and certain trade unions in March 1915. The measure which is now asked for, and the introduction of which has been promised, will make the Treasury Agreement statutory in respect of all establishments engaged on war work. A Bill on the necessary lines has been in draft for some time, but negotiations have been proceeding with the Ministry of Reconstruction in order to determine the question whether that Ministry or the Ministry of Munitions shall promote the required legislation. An agreement between the two Ministries on this point is impending.VI.-HOURS OF  LABOUR.The military situation has given a sharp check to the policy of reducing hours of labour. Over a short period, long hours give a better output than short hours ; the economy of shorter hours manifests itself only after some months. A reduction of hours, therefore, cannot safely be made during a crisis.Three weeks ago the Ministry was on the point of asking the Home Office to give effect to the following arrangements : 1. Boys under 16 to do no nighfc-work.2. Women and young persons to be limited to 12 hours daily, instead of 14. 3. Women on the two 12-hour shift system to have a maximum week of 5&apos;5% hours, instead of 60. All these proposals have had to be abandoned for the present. Moreover, arrange-ments have been made with the Home Office, whereby women and young persons in the principal establishments engaged in the manufacture of small arms ammunition, shall be allowed to work every Saturday and Sunday during April.VII.-IMPROVEMENT OF TIME-KEEPING.Pressure is being brought to bear on employers to report all cases of habitual bad tiihe-keeping to the Ministry. Employers are reluctant to do this through fear of losing their men. Workers who, after being warned by the Ministry, persist in losing time are now liable-.........   (a) If over military age, to be prosecuted before a munitions tribunal.(b) If of military age, to be brought before an Enlistment Complaints Com-mittee, on whose report the Ministry may withdraw their exemption from military service.* Regulation 8a.
VIII.-POOD FOR MUNITION WORKERS.Purchase.In order that canteens may get their due supply of controlled but non-rationed foodstuffs, arrangements are being made with the Ministry of Food, under which canteens in munition works, should they desire it, can purchase certain non-rationed articles of food from the wholesale firms who act as distributors for the Ministry of Food. By this arrangement a sure though limited supply of these foodstuffs will reach the canteens. At present arrangements are being made for refined suet, compound lard and cheese.Advisory Committee.The Minister has appointed an Advisory Committee, of which Mr. Kellaway is the chairman, to advise him on the problems arising out of the supply and distribution of food to munition workers. Lord D&apos;Abernon, Sir George Newman, K.C.B., and Mr. Towle, members of the Canteen Committee of the Liquor Control Board, have agreed to serve on the Committee, and also representatives of employers and workmen. It is hoped that the Admiralty will agree to nominate representatives also. The Committee will consist of about twelve members.The warning of an offender by the Ministry usually results in an improvement in time-keeping. The minority who fail to reform will in future be considered to have forfeited of their own will any claim to protection from military service.
