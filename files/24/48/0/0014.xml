We also wish to barter supplies from overseas against Ruseias national produce *   The local exportsr3 at Archangel aro willing to coma to tense., but the Bolnhovik Government may refuse the necessary export licences and. would probably bo supported in their action by the local Soviet.   Our action, when the two cargoes now on their way to Archangel, arrive in port, will de-psno. on e ire urn stances.era of the 7innish Government.   He will undertake on behalf of H*M* Government to consider applications from Finland for foodstuff as soon as the country has freed itself   from foreign intervention, and the Finnish Government are   able effectively to guarantee that the goods imported will be consumed in ?inlancL   He   will intimate that we cannot send supplies to a. country which continues to in-vite military occupation by the enemy.It is reported that the Ukranian Government will accept responsibility for that portion of the Russian state Debt which may justifiably be assigned to the Ukraine on the &quot;basis of popu-lation.     This woulo imply the acceptance of some 27$ of the Rues ian ooligations*BTOSAHK.     The United States War :rade Board have info rmed the Danish Minister at v/ashlngton that thoy feel bound to continue the negotiations for an Agreement If the Danish Government so desire, but that owing to the menacing attitude of Germany, theySir SHoward is negotiating at Stockholm with commission-
&apos;a&apos;ot think it advisable just at present for Denmark to enter into a definite Agreement with the Allies.   The v?ar Trade Board undertake in default of an Agreement, to allow Denmark supplies from time to time in return for suitable coneonsions.SWEDES. Government do not think it advisable, until themilitary position is clearer, to press Sweden for a definite and immediate answer to our proposals for a General Agreement.   Y/e -shall accordingly say nothing at present about requisitioning the Swedish shipping in Allied ports*   We shall however bear this proposal in mine *     She Swedish Government car e nov; pressing   the Cfemena to accent a reduction of their imports of Swedish iron oro to 3,500,000 tons.   There seems little prospect that tho Germane; will agree to this or any of the other restrictions on their imports from Sweden which are contemplated in our dx&amp;ft proposals.gbthhhlain)S. Mr. Van Vollenhoven states that the Putoh Governmentwill shortly reopen negotiations Cbr a general Agreement.   We havo disposed of the Dutch shipping question, but we still hope to se-eure supplies of Dutch home and colonial protuce and   to obtain the services of a Dutch fishing fleets   The JHetherlendo evidently desire to show their independence and to give   effect to the recent-ment which we have aroused by our requisitioning of the Dutch ships.    But they do not seem prepared to rick a complete broach with the Allies.On April 9th orders 7;ore iesueo by the Dutch Minister of Agriculture that no foodstuffs wore to leave Holland for the Belgian Belief Commission and that Relief supplies sent, to the frontier were to be seized.   This order me, however, countermanded in deference to an immediate protest from tho Belgian and French Ministers at the Hague.   All the Relief supplies noF in Holland will be allowed to go forward.     Supplies hereafter arriving in
3 mHolland will be detained poncing an Agreement with the British and American Govemi-iants.Sir      Soranley tm  erst ones that the negotiations of the Dutch Government with Germany have completely brokon down.   At the last meeting of the Dutch and German representatives the Dutch insisted that Germany should continue to supply Holland with coal pending a renewal of the German Dutch Agreement.   ;/hen the Overmans refused to guarantee any further deliveries the Dutch said that, failing this guarantee, they would not allow Germany any further credits. Tm Germans thereupon &quot;broke off the discussion one left the table. Sir i* Townloy thinks that Mr. ilroeller&apos;0 resignation may partly be clue to the feellBg that it is at pr sent impossible to negotiate with the Germans.S?/I!ggBHLAgD*      We noted last week that the German representatives appointed, to negotiate a renewal of the Gorman Swiss Economic Agroe-ment were likely to press for a stricter control over the use of German raw material in Swiss factories.   She Allies are officially info using: the federal Government that, if the Germans persist in their demand * a stricter control will be claimed over Swiss fao-tories which require copper, lubricating oil and other materials from Allied sources and that the Allies will require a total cessation of the exports to Germany at prasimt allowed unf er the 3.S.S. Agreement *The Germans are also pressing the Swiss to limit their exports of Swiss produce to the /lilies.     They threaten to. restrict or to discontinue altogether their exports of  German 00a1 to Swit-serland unless the Swiss cease to supply the Allies with wood. The Germans point out that trader the recent Allied 2wise Cattle Agreement the Federal Government agreed to limit the exports of Swiss produce to Germany ana they claim an agreement on similar lines.      Kr. Sohnltaess accordingly recomnends us not to ask for
any new formal Agreement in place of the expired Cattle Agreement, hut to arrange privately with the Swise that their exports to tho Allies of wood and condensed milk etc. shall &quot;bo maintained up to the quantities available.,   ThQ Federal Government invite us to die-! onus this question at once, preferably at Berne.   II.IU Government are recommencing this proposal to the French and Italian Government!H.M.
