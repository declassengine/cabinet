Report for the week ended 15th April. 1918*Pig,Production Section.Considerable correspondence has been dealt with referring to the formation of pig clubs, associations and municipal pig keeping and the difficulty in obtaining feeding stuffs.     The Ministry of Pood have now arranged for the issue of Priority Certificates for feeding stuffs for piga and it is hoped that this will much improve the position.     The Director has had conferences with officials of other Departments as to matters relevant to pig keeping and has arranged with the Ministry of Munitions for the construction of portable pig sties should there be any demand for them, Arrangements have also been made that will facilitate &apos;slabs&apos; being obtained for the construction of sties.Land DivisioncSmall Holding Colohiea.Ho^each.     Two further settlers have arrived this week and taken possession of cottages, making a total of twelve ex-Service men now working on this Colony, Of which number seven are residing in the cottages.     It has been possible to make satisfactory progress with the planting of the early potatoes, and it is hoped to finish this part of the work very soon.     The different operations of rolling and harrowing the wheat, rolling the spring corn, etc., have been delayed owing to the unfavourable weather.IL^l^-i^E^i.^*     Arrangements have been made with regard to the do5Ivery&quot;of seed to the Estate, and Messrs, Sutton and Sons of Reading have agreed to advise the Society on the question of seed production.     The erection of t^o concrete cottages upon the Estate is being proceeded with as far as possible, delay being caused chiefly by the question of labour and haulage.     Steam cultivation is in progress, and Mr. Colyer reports that this is being done **itJi exceptionally good results.Elax Production Branch.The final plans for the sowing and harvesting of the crop have now been settled:   the War Office have been approached with regard to the provision of army rations and camp equipment for the camps for workers which it will be necessary to provide.    The plans for the building of the factoriea referred to in last week&apos;s report, are being proceeded with, and it is expected that a definite arrangement as to what buildings will be required this year will be made very shortly.     Sufficient seed has now been received from Holland for sowing the whole of the acreage contracted for.
Tithe, Commons. Copyhold and Survey Branch.The applications tsceivod during the past week include seven for Altered Apportionment, four for Redemption, and one for Herser of Tithe Rentcharge, and two for the Enfranchisement of Copyhold Lands, while the cases oonfirmed include eight Altered Apportionments, seven Mergers, nine Redemptions under the Tithe Acts, and one Exchange under the Inclosure Actse     Progress has also been made with a number of uncompleted cases under the various acts administered by the Branch. The Board continue to receive various suggestions for the amendment of the provisions of the Tithe Acts.     In this connection it may be of interest to note that on the 15th inst. the Committee on Tithe Rentcharge appointed by the Lo^er Eouse of Convocation of Canterbury in February last issued their Report.     The Report.states that it is by means of Redemption that the problem of dealing with the difficulties created by the rapid increase in the value of tithe rentcharge can most readily be solved.     The Committee point out that under the present provisions cf the Tithe Acts the terms of Redemption are heavy and that as a result redemptions have hitherto been few and far between and they recommend that so far as practicable opportunity should be given for free bargaining.     The Committee suggest that if the titheowner and tithe payer can agree as to terms, and these terms are approved by this Board and (in the case of a Benefice) by Queen Anne5s Bounty it is desirable that the Law should be so amended as to. allow the bargain to be completed. The Committee think that the proposal that during the next seven or ten years a tithe payer shall be able to obtain an Order of Redemption by offering twenty years&apos; purchase of the par value is one to which     &apos; the Church may agree.     Proposals are alao made in the Report for the payment of Redemption Money by instalments.Ordnance Purvey.During the week 217,105 maps were sent to France and 29,927 to the Admiralty.     26 relief models were sent th Prance.Oommeroial Control Branch.The work of the Branch during the week, in addition enquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war has consisted principally of correspondence as to railway facilities for laroh trees, agricultural and dairying machinery, cattle, seed potatoes and agricultural produce, and railway rates for fertilisers, the approval of names for margarine and correspondence on matters arising in connection witn the Sale of .Food and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 3,618, in response to which 16,900 copies of Leaflets were despatched.

Fisheries Division. Fishermen1 s Registration&apos; aria-Recruiting Section/Fishermen and Naval Service. The Military Service Bill In its relation to Naval Recruiting of fishermen is under consideration.     It is possible at present for a fisherman to enrol in the R.17vR. , Section T. up to the age of 50, and methods are being suggested by which the continuance in fishing either   permanently or temporarily of the men &quot;Between the ages of 41 and 51 years can be secured.     A. further 4raft of 3.00 men from England and Scotland has been requested by tne Admi ral ty *Fishermen. ,Pish Trade&apos;and Military Service^     An inspeOtiOn of North Shields with a.view to examining the needs of the port for the forthcoming herring season has been carried out, and a- small number of requests for release of men from the Army for service as drivers of motor lorriesj and in other occupations, have been reoeived.&quot;  Efforts are being made to secure assistance through the Port Transit and Labour Committee3     It is also hoped to arrange that should men be available at the time assistance can be obtained from the garrison f or &apos; exceptional glut as the occasion arises.     The position of the fish trade under both the Order of the Ministry of National Service-,. No. R* 49, and under the Military Service Bill as far as this oan at present be forecasted, is receiving the attention of the Board.Permit Section.     53 Permits have been issued and 40 cancelled.     The areas allowed for fishing in the Thames Estuary have been considerably extended, and arrangements are being made&quot; to include the additional areas under the B0ard&apos;s system of control.&apos;    Reports of the sinking Of One sailing, steam; and 3 motor&quot; fishing vessels by enemy submarines have been received.Freshwater Pish Committee.     The principal activity has been in connection with the sale of Elvers from the Epney Depot.     A considerable number of orders have been received, the largest being for 200,000 from the Thames Conservancy.    A large proportion of the orders are for comparatively small lots foir stocking Smaller sheets of water and considerable interest seems to be taken by the Public in the matter.     Steps are being taken to form a scheme for1 the erection of a large eel fishery business in marshy lands adjacent to the sea coast. A letter to the Press as to the Close Season was prepared and send out.Motor Loan Committee..       The Committee have had the pleasure of entertaining an eminent French Naval Architect who visited this country at the request of the French Fisheries Department to obtain information of the methods employed by the Committee in converting sailing vessels to power craft.     It is hoped that the information accorded them, and &quot;the particulars obtained.by them from a viBit to actual vessels at various ports will assist the French Department in their endeavours to increase the supplies of fish available in that country.     Amongst other things which were shown the French Delegates on their visit was the engine designed by the Committee1s experts especially for fishing vessels, which, it so happened, was to ran its preliminary bench test on the 12th irist.     This visit proved of great interest and it is possible that the engine may be built, under royal+y, by a well known French firm of internal combustion engine builders.     As regards the performances of the engine, the Committee&apos;s experts were very well Satisfied.     There are however small modifications &quot;&quot;which will need to be adopted before the engine is installed in a fishin-?: bOat,     The outstanding features of the engine are its extreme simplicity and the accessibility Of all moving parts; the   endeavour has been to make the engine   as nearly fool-proof as possible, and it snould prove very popular with the fishing industry.
The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines indicated in previous reports. yy19th Ap.riI, 1918*Secretary.
