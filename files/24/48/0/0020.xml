Re*   of the U.S.A, Minister for Portugal.Versailles,March 26th, 1918.(V).USE OF DEADLY OASES.proposed answer of Allied Governments to Geneva Red Cross. Prepared by the Military RepreTentatives at Versailles.(S.W.C. 143) .The Governments of the Allied Powers, signatories of the Hague Convention, have received in a spirit of sincerest sympathy the appeal which the Committee of the Red Cross has addressed to them with the praiseworthy object of putting an end, if possible, to the use as a means of war of poisonous and asphyxiating gases.More than any, the Allied powers associate themselves with the generous and truly humane ideas which in this as in other cases inspire the Geneva Committee:   they fully share the Committee^ sense of horror and sadness at the realisation that science, instead Of being applied to the relief of human troubles, is daily prosti-tuted to the pitiless work of increasing general destruction.It is only too true, as the Committee says, that those who first did not hesitate to invent such means of war-as deadly gases assumed a fearful responsibility.   Once auch methods are intro-duced by one side, the adversary under pains of self sacrifice cannot refrain from having recourse to them and from seekinr to so perfect his use of them, in order to,gain and not suffer mastery.At the beginning of the present war, the- Allied Powers believed and had the ri/jht to believe with the whole world, that barbarous methods of refined cruelty in war were done with as between civilised nations.   Explicit ana solemn pledges had been taken that no use should ever be made of poison or of arms, pro-jectiles or other meanB of war aiming at the infliction of needless
sufferings  With the Committee of the Sad Gross, the Allied Powers consider that poisonous and asphyxiating gases are clearly included in this prohibition.The pledge figured in the Convention of which various 3-overnments - notably the Imperial German Government - guaranteed loyal execution,-  If any value was to be attaohed to the word of honour of Sovereign States, no conviction seemed better establish than that of the Allied Powers that their troops&apos; would not be subjected to the tortures of deadly gas and need not be furnished with any equipment to protect them against it*This was the situation when in April 1915 the Allied forces were assailec- by a new enemy in the shape of deadly gases, first asphyxiating, then poisonous.   The appalling sufferings caused by this insidious and treacherous attack have boon only too accurately desoribed by the Committee.   The Sermon Empire had recourse to methods it had expressly undertaken not to use, and had again broken its word.For months it beeame the duty of the Allied Powers to seek and to discover means of protecting their troops against these dastardly abominations and to furnish them with the power of resisting their adversaries with e^ual arms,    This task is now accomplishes.In its eloquent appeal the Committee pleads for an agree-ment to be undertaken immediately and loyally upheld by the Armies to stop the use of these gases *!tith any other adversary, had such a question been possible, the Allied iowers would not hesitate to give their agreement without reservation.     Ihey agreed in 1899 and in 1907 and ere , ready to pledge themselves with any one whose word is kept.But in d aling &quot;,itH the Sermon Empire and ita subordinates, what guarantee could the Allied Powers have that this new agree-ment would be better kept than its predecessors?     Gould the new agreement be more explicit and solemn than the previous one, cheerfully betrayed by the German Empire, as soon as it consider betrayal expedient?In spite of all, if the German Government to-c.ay declares that it adheres to the Committee^ proposal and offers detailed and effective guarantees that an agreement to discontinue the use of gas v?ill be observed, the Allied Governments will not refuse to examine its proposals in the most liberal spirit.   But without such guarantees, the Allied Governments would fail in their duty in not having recourse to every means of depriving their opponents of their power to harm.2 Whitehall Sard ns, Aoril 13th, 1918.
