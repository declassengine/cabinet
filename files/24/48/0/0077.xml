ifV(This - documcnir is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government) SECRET.FORTH   CLYDE   CANAL.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.In accordance with the instruction of the War Cabinet (No. 253 -      Minute  18), I have examined, in conjunction with the Departments concerned, the proposal for n Ship Canal connecting tho Firths of Forth jr.id ClydeI have received and considered Reports from the Works Department of the Admiralty and from the Board of Trade, and havo held conferences with the following DepartmentsAdmiralty, War Office, Board of Trade, Scottish Office, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Labour, whose advice and assistance I am glad to acknowledge.1.   THE PROPOSAL -The War Cabinet are probably aware that alternative routes have been suggested for this Canal - one a direct route between the Forth and the Clyde, the other an indiroct route via Loch Lcmond.2. THE COST.The pre-war estimate for the Loch Lomond route was approximately  38,000,000.     Tho pre-war estimate for the direct or southern route was approximately  42,000,000.     It is, however, quite clear that neither estimate is reliable, and I am satisfied that/
until a detailed survey has &quot;been made of the routes, it is not -possible to secure an approximately reliable estimate of the ultimate cost of the work.3* STRATEGICAL VALUE.The view of the Admiralty as to the strategical value may thus be summarised:- that if the Canal had been In existence during the present war, it would have been of great value, and that, as far as it Is possible to forecast future conditions, It will certainly prove of great value in any future operations of war.The Loch Lomond routo, In the opinion of tho Admiralty, possesses great advantages strategically over the direct route, though some of the objections to the latter which held good formerly have been removed by tho present proposal for a sea-level e&amp;nal.4. COMMERCIAL VALUE.As to the commercial value of tho Canal, I find it is generally agreed that by neither route would the canal prove a paying proposition; and no evidence had been forthcoming on vrhieh any trustworthy estimate of the probable return could be formed.     The view is commonly held that the Direct route passing, as it does, through a highly developed industrial district,will provide the greater commercial returns, but due weight does not appear to have been given to the fact that for the greater part of its length tho ground level will be more then 100 fe*t above the level of the canal, nor to the possibility of subsidence from coal workings.
&quot;j&amp;ie Departments which I have consulted attach no importance to the argument advanced by Messrs. Armstrong Whitworth in favour of immediate action that the construction of the Canal would prove of great value as a stabiliser of labour after the war, as expenditure in other ways of the sum needed for Its construction would prove far more effective fcr this purpose.      I concur in this view.&amp;*     RECOMMENDATION.As a result of a full consideration of the proposals, I desire to submit the following recommendations to the war Cabinet :-fA) The considerations advanced by the Admiralty ire of a.    weighty nature, and I therefore recommend that an independenti;detailed survey, with the necessary geological surveys, be\made for a Canal capable of accommodating. War Ships by theLoch Lomond route, with an extension for Merchant Ships .toDumbarton, the cost of this survey being roughly estimated at 25,000.     The Admiralty and Board of Trade should be associatedin arranging for the survey.(3) A Public Enquiry should be held :-(.1)       To ascertain and report upon the commercial possibilities of the Loch Lomond route, with the commercial extension, and cf a low level Canal by the direct route;iil)     To advise whether the commercial possibilities of the direct route thus ascertained are such as to justify a similar survey being undertaken in respect of this route, at an additional cost estimated&apos; at  25,000.-fC) If the Public Enquiry reports in the affirmative on(B)  (ii)  above, the survey suggested in (A) should be extendedto the direct route.The Board of Trade and the Scottish Office should I suggestr be responsible jPor- arranging the Public Enquiry suggested.Christopher Addison. 15th. April 1918.,
