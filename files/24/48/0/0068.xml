Secretary.r vj&amp;lX        The War Cabinet some weeks ago decided that the Military Authorities in Ireland should be allowed t.o deport to England certain persons engaged in seditious practices in Ireland,     It was originally proposed that this . should be done under Defence of the Realm Regulation No.14 which -enables the military authorities to remove suspects from any area and to fix their place of residence.The Irish Government state that it. will soon be necessary to deal in this way with about 150 suspects:   but the War Office point out (and my advisers &quot;entirely agree with them), that though suspects might be removed under Regulation, 14 to places in England,, it would be practically -.-       .  1 impossible to watch and control them while at large;-   that they would be able at any time to leave the place fixed.for their residence, and get into hiding or (in some cases) return in disguise to Ireland.     It is therefore desirable that they should not merely be deported to England butr interned here. ^This, can be done under Regulation 14&apos;B. if (as in the case of the      -Sinn Feiners &quot;in 1916)&apos;&quot;hostile associations&quot; can be proved;   but at the present moment it is doubtful whether connection with the enemy can be &apos; proved in the case of most of the Sinn Fein leaders.It is therefore proposed io amend Regulation. 1433 so as to extend the power of internment given to the Secretary of State .to. the same descrip-tion of persons as can be deported under Regulation 14,-namely, &quot;any person suspected of acting, or having asted, or being about to act in a manner prejudicial1 to the public safety- or the defence of the realm&quot;:   but to confine this to places where the. operation of Section 1 of the Defence of the&quot; Realm (Amendment) Act,. 1915, is suspended,.that is, at presenti-to Ireland. &apos;*i . .*   - .:!
It is proposed at the same time tft provide that the internment orders as regards Ireland may be made by the Chief Secretary for Ireland instead of the Seoretary of State, and that the place of internment may be in any part of the British Islands.A Draft of the proposed Amendment is annexed..0. GAVE.18th April. 1318.Regulation&apos;14B shall be amended as follows:-(l)   In the first paragraph after the words &quot;in such place&quot; there shallbe inserted the words &quot;in the British Islands&quot;.
