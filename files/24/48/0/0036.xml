CIRCULATED TO THE 1AR CAB BUT.Sir M. Hankey.I was unfortunately absent (owing to Doctorfs orders) from Friday&apos;s Cabinet.   I understand that the Cabinet then directed a telegram to be drawn up about Eastern affairs.   Lord R. Cecil who was present at the meeting, and therefore understands the CabinetTs views, has been good enough to prepare the accompanying draft, which should be circulated.   He should be asked to be present when it is discussed,,(initialled)    A.J.B.r
Draft Telegram to Lord Reading (Washington).Our military authorities remain very anxious as to the position in Russia0   They point out that the situation there must be considered as a whole,,   The most imminent danger is lest the Germans should be able to move to the west more of the divisions stillremaining in the east0   At present there are still-if &apos; -some     divisions left there, but they are slowly being withdrawn, and so long as disorganisation and disintegration continue in Russia more and more German troops v/ill be moved from the east to the westo   The only threat effective to prevent the removal of the German forces would be the creation of some important and definitely pro-Ally force in Russia,   It may however now be too late to do this.Besides   this, there is great risk that the Germans will obtain considerable supplies of all sorts from Russia.   The actual amount of grain seized in the south does not appear to have been very important, but if the Germans can remain substantially in occupation of those districts they will no doubt in the course of the next few months draw large supplies from thern0Then there are huge food resources in that district of Western Siberia of which Omsk is the centre Besides these, there are the great stores at yiadivostock, Archangel, Petrograd and Moscow,   It is not too much to say that if our enemies became mastersof
Of all these resources their powers of resistance would be indefinitely prolonged.&apos;Next, it is clearly part of the German design to stir up trouble for us in India.   For that purpose they are making  preparations to penetrate Persia, and probably Turkestan as well.   For each of these lines of approach it is necessary for them to become masters of the Caucasian districtsc   To accomplish this they are relying partly on direct action from the south-east of Russia and across the Black Sea, and partly on Turkish action against Russian-Armenia, and Georgia.   Something may be done to stop these plans by direct military intervention in Persia, but local action in Transcaucasia will also be necessary to cut off our enemies approaching Turkestan across the Caspian Sea.Finally, there is grave danger lest the continued disorder in Russia should drive all those who are suffering from it - and they are a rapidly increasing body - to prefer even German intervention to a continuance of the present state of things.   We have seen this motive operate in the Ukraine and in Finland, and we are warned that it is growing in strength in all parts of Russia,To meet all these dangers requires a bold and comprehensive policy.   Something may be done by the presence of Allied forces at such ports as Murmansk, Archangel and viadivostock to prevent the loss of the stores at those places, but tha-U-is a very small part of the whole problem.   It is the unanimous opinion of allour
oup military advisers that it is hopeless to expect the ^creation of any really effective military force in Russia at the present time, at any rate by unaided Russian effort, and without such a force none of the main objects of our policy can be accomplished.   Even if it were possible for the Soviet Government to create a new army by their own exertions, it is by no means certain that they would use it to fight or hamper the Germans *  Their object is not military victory, but social revolution all over the world, and it might well be that they would think they would secure that object more easily by encouraging peaceful penetration of Germany than by fighting her military forces,,Moreover, we are advised that a very large proportion seme observers say more than half-of the Russian people are passionately anxious for Allied intervention as the only means of saving them from anarchy on the one hand and German domination on the other.   Even Trotsky shows signs of adopting this opinion, but he is apparently reluctant to take the decisive step of asking for it.   From the Allied point of view there certainly appears no other means of   -safety.   Please therefore urge on the United States Government that they should instruct their agents at Moscow to use every possible argument to induce the Soviet Government to assent to Allied intervention.   Such intervention from the geographical necessities of the case must be mainly Japanese a   But we contemplate associating with them representative elements   belonging to other Allied Governments including if possible America.
