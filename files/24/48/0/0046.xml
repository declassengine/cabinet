S EC R E T&apos;;16th April.   1918,The situation at Murmansk and Finnish Intentions with regard tc acquisition cf the Murman Coast.Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.1.-  The situation at Murmansk cannot he adequately considered without a brief summary cf the events now taking -place in South Finland and in the Gulf cf Finland,a2.-   It has been reported (but Admiralty have no con-fir mat ion) that on 8th March Germany concluded at Berlin i &quot;treaty&quot; with certain Finns by which she took the new &quot;Republic of Finland&quot; under her &quot;protection/1This &quot;treaty&quot; declared the Aland Islands to be Finnish territory and was the pretext for the German occupation of the Archipelago.Whether this is true or net is net known, but the Germans with the assistance cf their fleet have safely established themselves on the Aland Islands and in South Finland with about 15,000 troops, and there is absolutely no doubt that thev have done so by request cf the Finnish White Guards and with the approval of Sweden, while the Finnish Red Guards, who may&quot;be said to represent the Bolsheviks, are resisting them.Helsin?fcrs is practically in their possession, as the German Military Division entered the town on 12th April and the German fleet is close off the pert.3a-  As re;gards the situation in the north, it has been reported (but the Admiralty has received no confirmation) that the &quot;Republic of Finland&quot; has signed a &quot;treaty&quot; with the Bolsheviks at Petrcgrad, whereby the Bolsheviks have agreed that the boundaries cf Finland should be extended to the shores cf the White Sea and that Finland should receive a port in the Arctic.As there is ample evidence that the Finnish White Guards are fighting the Finnish Red Guards both in the South of Finland and round Kern and Kandalaksha in the North and as the Bolsheviks are kackine the Red Guards, it would appear very doubtful if there was or ever had been any &quot;treaty&quot; between the Bolsheviks and the Finnish White Guards.4.-  It may well be that the Finnish White Guards as representing the mere stable elements in the country, wish to&quot;break away entirely from Russian Control and extend their boundaries to the While Sea and thereby tc obtain control cf an ice-free pert In the ArcticFor this pert tc be of any real value they must also have control of the Murman Railway.It Is therefore only tc be expected that the White Guards, led or supported by Germans, will endeavour tc occupy the Kola Inlet&quot;.
f&apos;5.-  It is net tc be supposed for a moment that the Germans are assisting the Finnish White Guards without an ulterior mctiv: ;n view which will he tc their own advantage.It is considered that the Hermans will first organise the Finnish White Guards, and thoroughly defeat the Finnish Red Guards.    They will then make the White Guards advance in force against the-Murman Railway, and having gained control of this will finally make their advance against the Kola Inlet and the Marxian Ccasu thereby thoroughly establishing themselves in Northern Russia under the guise of Finnish White &quot;Guards.The Kola Inlet then becomes a German Pert - cur trade with the White Sea becomes impossible and there is every possibility of a German submarine base being established from which tc operate against England.6o- Taking the situation in Finland generally :-On the one hand we have the Finnish White Guards&apos; suppo rted by Germans, fighting the Finnish Red Guards supported by the Bolsheviks, and on &quot;trie other hand we have telegrams passing between H.M. Government and the British Minister at Stockholm as to whether we shall provide foodstuffs for the population of Finland and as tc whether we shall recognise the Finnish Constitution - i.e.   the Finnish White Guards&quot;supported by Germany.This is a somewhat confusing situation - and needs clear- -g up, especially in view of the action being taken by Admiral Kemp at Murmansk.7.- The situation at Murmansk can now be considered.As far back as February IP18 the Rear Admiral at Murmansk pointed cut that he had! learnt from Russian sources that the Germans were attempting tc effect an economic arrange -ment with Murman authorities and were insisting on the expulsion cf-British Men-cf-War from the Kola Inlet,    He asked for an expeditionary force of 6000 men for the defence cf ?*urmansk -these tc include advance parties at Kern and Kandalaksha.On 1st March he reported that the garrison at Murmansk were shewing themselves anti-ally in intention and that he considered It most important thai his naval forces should be reinforced.    He said&quot; that if he was ffiven a Battle Cruiser with a landing party cf 300 extra marines he could guarantee tc occupy the town&quot;of Murmansk and secure the place, temporarily at any rate, from enemy or Finnish invasion.Then on 23rd March the Admiral reported that the general feeling at Murmansk was not anti-ally possibly owing tc the presence cf the Allied Squadron and possible because we had arranged tc send feed there for the local population.P.- As a result of the Admiral&apos;s urgent representations, made a. the time when the Germans appeared tc be advancing cn Petrcgrad, the British battleship &quot; lory&quot;, at that time the only Allied warship in the Kola Inlet, was quickly re-inferced by the British Cruiser &quot;Ccchrane&quot; and the French Cruiser &quot;Amiral Auben.The American Government was invited tc send a warship and has new consented so that the Allied Squadron will be thoroughly representative.The/
fThe Allied Fcrces at present under the orders cf Admiral Kemp are therefore as follows :-The British Battleship &quot;GLORY&quot;&quot;       &quot;      Cruiser   &apos; &quot;COCHRANE&quot;&quot;   French       &quot; &quot;AMIRAL AUBF&quot;.In addition, tc the crews cf these ships the Admiralhas :-oO extra marines.20 Royal Engineers sent tc him specially as a &quot;demolition&quot; party to blew up bridges, etc,   if the necessity arises.200 French Artillery men. An armoured train.An unknown and constantly increasing; number of Allied Military details who have reached&apos;Murmansk in the hope of being repatriated.0c   With reference to the Admiralls request for a military expedition fcr the defence cf Murmansk, this question was considered by the Allied Naval Council and the Military Representatives cf the Supreme Far Council at Versailles on 2ord March 1918,    They decided that under existing; conditions no military resources whatever were available fcr an expedition tc Murmansk, but that the Naval steps actually being; taken should be continued in order tc retain this place in the possession cf the Allies as Icng as possible.10.    The presence cf this Allied Squadron at Murmansk appears tc have been quite favourably received by the Bolshevik Ocvernment.On the 19th March the Rear Admiral at Murmansk reported that 400 Red Guard Finns had arrived at Kandalaksha from Finland via Petrcgrad with a large supply of rifles and ammunition with which  c arm ether Red Guards,  while cn the 22nd March the Naval Attache Petrcgrad reported that a Russia &quot;Division&quot; had been despatched fcr the protection cf the Murman Railway.On 29th March, M0 Trotsky is said tc have telegraphs! tc Murmansk Soviet &quot;organise defence cf district and accept fcr this purpose any assistance Allied trccps   offer&quot;.Subsequently the Russian Press reported that the English and French, having recognised the Murman Council as Supreme local authority, Had agreed tc support Council with necessaries for district and Red Army.On 4th April Sir S. Howard telegraphed from Stockholm that^Murman Soviet had informed Pe-trcgrad&quot;&quot;Authorities that Finnish White Guards were planning; attack cn Murman Railway and that Soviet had appealed tc Allied Forces fcr assistance and that M. Trotsky had approved cf this appeal.11.    It seems therefore that the Bolshevik Government are prepared tc defend the Murman Railway and the Murman Coast against Finnish cr German designs, but in the opinion cf Admiral Kemp no direct resistance can be expected from the Russians, and It is considered that whatever resistance is to be offered must be dene by the Allies.
12.      The Rear Admiral at Murmansk hasbeen instructed to take any stops ho considers necessary and desirable with the forces it has been found possible to send him to protect and further Allied inteEsts generally, to assist the repatria-tion of Allied Subjects and to do what he. can to assist in the steps being taken to recover the Allied stores at Archangel,He has also been told he is not to commit himself to land military operations away from the Port but subject to this restriction he may use the crews of the ships to stiffen local resistance a gainst nG-e rman or Finnish invasion if practicable.13a      The Admiralty have been unable to give the Admiral a definite line of policy to take and consequently have only-been able to give horn the above general instructions,&quot; 14,      Acting on these instructions the Admiral reports that he has made arrangements for the defence of the district with the forces he has at his disposal., has landed 150 marines to keep order in Murmansk and to protect the Russian stores of food from being looted, and has sent a detachment of French soldiers and the armoured train manned by French and British under the French Oclonel Moretiere down the Murman line to Kandalaicsha6150      It will be seen that Admiral Kemp!s position is very unsat::factoryn   He has a landing force of about 600 Allied seamen and marines, 200 French Artillery men with a few small guns,, an armoured train and the guns of the squadron.This force is undoubtedly sufficient to repel u. email hostile raiding force,, but that is all.   He cannot count on any real resistance from the Russians .   At any moment the situation may change, and the necessity arise of either eva-ouating the Kola Inlet in face of the advance of a large hostile force, or of the Allies sending a tiilitary. expedition to hold it,IS,      The Admiralty therefore desire a definite ruling from the War Cabinet on the follov/ing points so that the situation may be cleared up and the Admiral be instructed accordingly.(a) Is the Kola Inlet to be held by the Allied orces against any small raiding force of Finnish White Guards, They proba&apos; ly would bo led by Germans, but that would net theoretically alter their Finnish character).(b) In the event cf the advance of a large forceof Finnish White Guards; (l) is the Kola Inlet to be evacuated or (2) are the Allied forces present to hold on and resist as well as they can,   Or (o) will the Allies send a Military force sufficient to hold It,In this connection, it is considered that a large mil-it.-. y force would not be necessary and that the Admiral&apos;s -estimate of 6,000 men might be accepted until a Military Officer had had tine to report.(sgd).   RCE0 WEMYSS,Forwarded.(sgd) ERIC GEDDES 0,   ^     16. 4. 18.Since the above Memorandum was prepared the following telegram has been received from, the. Rear Admiral at Murmansk, . and the Admiralty desire that this telegram should be taken into/consideration
by the War Cabinet, and a definite decision given as to the answer to he sent to the Bear Admiral.( Copy Telegram)From Rear Admiral -  Murmansk,To Admiralty. 15th April91918,364.        Affairs in Murmansk district will in future he regulated by a&apos; Council embracing representatives from all principal towns and areas in the district, District includes Pechenga up to the Norwegian and Finnish frontier3 Kandalaksha Kern and Soroka,, ? (Headquarters of Council will &quot;be at Murmansk,,   Rep-resentatives are now assembling and expect to hold first meeting in about a week0   Suggest advantage be taken of the first meeting to make an authorative statement as to peliuy of Great Britain with regard to ? (Human) ,   Request I may be authorised to state offioially that Great Britain has no intention of annealing any part cf Hannah district, and will continue to assist in defence of district with such forces as can lae spared from other things against outside aggression., and will maintain friendly relations on basis of mutual advantage to both sidesa   Would also suggest I may be authorised to say that Groat Britain? (would) view with greatest concern any alterations political status of the district lying between present frontiers Norway Finland and Russiaa   The reported action of Great Britain aJapan in the Far East has given rise to much suspicion as to intentions of Allies of which advantage is taken by Anti-Ally influences. This is added reason for giving authc^it&amp;iiveguarantees, on above basis, and would suggest if possible I may be permitted to add that neither Japan nor Great Britain have any annexational intentions in Siberia0 Would suggest that French and American representatives should be authorised to make similar declaration but would beg tfcat answer to this telegram may not be delayed cn this account as in my opinion it is important that a declaration of this nature should be made at the opening meeting of the New Councile
