(This Document is the Proo^vof    ^^--oHis Britannic Majestv&apos;s 3d(770\ MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, April 10, 1918.PART I.-ACTION  TAKEN. Control of Supplies and Prices.Allied Requirements. Mr. Owen Smith cables that he has finally arranged with the United States Food Administration, the United States Army Quartermasters Department and the Chicago packers, despite many difficulties, for the British military requirements of corned beef for the months of April, May and June. This has only been rendered possible by the United States Army and the packers making many alterations and concessions and by the consent of the United States Army to use Argentine beef and to alter the size of the United States Army tins in order to meet urgent British needs. The War Office have cabled through the Ministry of Food expressing their appreciative thanks to Mr. Owen Smith, the United States Food Administration and the United States Army authorities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has left in Lord Heading&apos;s hands the arrange-ment of the finance involved by the acceptance of Mr. Hoover&apos;s special offer of hog products. In regard to this the demand upon shipping consequent upon the acceleration of the transport of American troops to France has introduced unexpected tonnage difficulties. Lord Reading has cabled stating that it is &quot; essential that there shall be no failure to provide the tonnage promised.&quot; Mr. Owen Smith cables that if the Ministry of Shipping can definitely promise tonnage for at least 40,000 tons weekly from now until the end of June it would be safe to place an order for the 200,000 tons of hog products offered by Mr. Hoover and adds that he has made arrangements with the packers for adequate curing and refrigeration during the summer months and for travelling inspectors to visit the various packing houses as well as making storage arrangements for quantities that cannot be shipped.The following cable has been received from Mr. Hoover through Mr. Sheldon : &quot; We are now in the season of increase dairy products production and we are likely to have considerable surpluses in condensed milk, butter, and cheese. In order to enable us to formulate any policy as to conservation and to pro-vision of supplies for the Allies it is critically necessary for us to have some indication of what the English demands for these products are likely to be monthly over the next six months. Also we would like to know what prices are being paid for colonial products of the same type now being delivered in England.   Will you secure early action in this matter from Lord Rhondda ? &quot;Bacon, Rams, and Lard. A satisfactory settlement has at length been reached in the matter of compensation to the Canadian packers for their losses incurred by continuing to ship their goods after the maximum importers&apos; prices had been fixed. As stated in the Report of the 2nd January, 1918, the Treasury was at first unable to accept the view of the Food Controller that compensation should be given, but this decision of the Treasury has now been reconsidered and the grievance of the Canadian packers removed.The Bacon (Prohibition of Export) Order, 1918, forbidding the export of pig products from Great Britain to Ireland is the corollary of the Pig and Pig Products (Prohibition of Export) (Ireland) Order, 1918, under which the export from Ireland was similarly prohibited. The pig products of Ireland will be used to meet con-sumption in that country, the surplus only being exported. Hitherto it has been the practice for Ireland to export a considerable proportion of its production to Great Britain and to import American bacon from Great Britain to satisfy part of the Irish requirements.   The waste and risk involved by this system will in future be avoided.The question of cold storage is urgent as an important part of the present large arrivals must be put into cold storage to cover the requirements of the summer period during which importation is diminished,a   (33)6483-2  pk 1   120  4/18  e &amp; s a
The preparation of a revised schedule of maximum prices for the home-produced commodities has made further progress and a satisfactory agreement was reached at a conference with representatives of the Irish curers.Butter. A further purchase of 6,000 tons of butter has been made in the Argentine Republic at the price of 170s. per cwt. f.o.b. Buenos Aires. This amount represents the exportable output from that country from April to August 1918. There have also been purchased 100 tons of Dutch butter at 312s. per cwt. landed, and 93 tons from the United States of America at prices varying from 40 to 46 cents per pound f.o.s. New York.During the week 3,389 tons of butter have arrived in this country, of which 1,776 tons came from Australia, 380 tons from New Zealand, 932 tons from the United States, 56 tons from Canada, 37 tons from South Africa, and 208 tons from the Argentine Republic.   The quantity on the water on the 6th April was 19,734 tons.4,217 tons of butter were distributed on April 1st, and the stocks on hand on April 6th amounted to 8,754 tons.Cereals. The Growing Grain Crops Order, 1918, dated 5th April, forbids the feeding of cattle with any growing wheat, oats, barley (except winter-sown barley) or dredge corn in such a way as to prevent the crop coming to maturity, or prejudicially to affect the growth of such crop. It also forbids the cutting of the same crops before maturity.   &quot; Cattle &quot; includes horses, sheep, goats, deer, and swine.An Order, dated 5th April, 1918, [amending the Grain (Prices) Order, 1917, revokes Clause 5 of the Principal Order, and enacts that on and after April 11th, the maximum price of barley bought by a miller or by any other person from a recognised dealer may not exceed the standard rate by more than one shilling per quarter of 448 lbs.Cheese. A further quantity of 11,161 tons of New Zealand cheese has arrived and further shipments of 3,789 tons have been made, making a total of 6,400 tons now on the way to this country.A further 765 tons of Australian cheese have also arrived, and the quantity on the way is 1,173 tons. Contracts amounting to 7,090 tons have been placed in the United States of America ; 267 tons have already arrived in this country, and 599 tons are on the way. There has been a further shipment of 61 tons of old season Canadian cheese.An Order dated 28th March, 1918, amending the British Cheese Order, 1917. substitutes a new schedule for that of the Principal Order, and provides that the maker of any cheese (other than cheese of the Caerphilly, Wenshydale, Stilton, and &quot; Small Holder &quot; types) shall cause the same to be marked immediately after it is made with the date of its manufacture, and that no addition shall be made to. the price of such cheese to compensate for shrinkage.Eggs. The Food Controller has issued a general licence authorising any person to acquire eggs for the purpose of preserving them for use in his own household, provided that notice of the number of eggs to be acquired and preserved is sent to the Food Control Committee for the district in which the person usually resides, and that the number of eggs so acquired does not exceed the number of eggs stated in such notice, or if objection is taken by the Committee to the number stated, the number permitted by the Committee.Feeding Stuffs. The application of the Cattle Feeding Stuffs Priority Supply Order has now been extended to agricultural horses, calves under six months, store pigs and breeding sows, whereas originally priority certificates were granted only in the case of dairy cows. :      The rations are as follows : Agricultural horses   -      -      -      -      -   10 lbs. per day. Calves under six months 1 lb.       ,,Breeding sows       . -     -     -     - 4 lbs.     ,,Store pigs -------    H- lbs.    ,,Fish. A strike which lasted two days occurred at Grimsby Docks when the new Fish Prices Order came into force. It appears that among the wholesalers there was a system of bribing the dock labourers who packed the fish, to put in extra weight (amounting sometimes to as much as two or three extra stone of fish). It is estimated that over 20,000Z. per annum was lost to owners by this means. Under the new Order the fish must be weighed.; During the strike the work was carried on by men from His Majesty&apos;s mine-sweepers.
Margarine-Considerable economies, both in railway transport and in the quan-tity distributed, may be shown up to the present as results of the working of the Margarine Distribution Scheme which came into operation in England and Wales on the 25th March. Considering the number of consignments and of the Local Authorities involved, there have been remarkably few causes of complaint, none of which have been of a serious nature, since it has been found possible to adjust inequalities of distribution without delay, complaints in the majority of cases having been found to be due to unavoidable delays on the railway. A special staff has been set up in order to give to the Local Authorities concerned the necessary instruction as to the detailed working of the scheme; this staff consists of men with expert knowledge of the trade who go to places where difficulties have arisen and assist the Local Authorities and others to set matters right.The Ministry have received valuable assistance from the various manufacturers and importers of margaride who have, without exception, co-operated very heartily in the working of the scheme.Meat. The, national scheme of meat rationing came into force throughout Great Britain on the 7th April.Individual cards have been issued and registered with butchers. Caterers and institutions have received &quot; preliminary Demand Notes &quot; which they have sent to the retailers from whom they wished to obtain supplies of butchers meat. Registration of individual cards does not apply to pork, which may be sold &quot;free of the tie,&quot; but may only be sold by a general butcher to his registered customers.From the individual cards and preliminary demand notes registered with him each butcher has prepared and forwarded to his Food Control Committee a return of his weekly requirements for the first four weeks of rationing.From these returns each Food Control Committee prepared a schedule showing-the weekly requirements of each butcher in the Committee&apos;s district. On this schedule the Committee also noted the requirements of each caterer and institution buying meat by wholesale. These schedules where then forwarded to Area Meat Agents.From the schedules Area Meat Agents prepared permits to buy live stock or dead meat to cover the requirements of each butcher. No butcher who receives a permit to buy live stock will be given a dead meat permit, and, vice versa, no butcher who is given a dead meat permit will receive a live stock permit.Dead meat may only be purchased from a wholesale supplier, with whom the butcher has registered by sending to the supplier a notification of registration in the prescribed form. Area Meat Distribution Committees have power to limit the number of butchers to be supplied by any wholesale supplies, and to transfer registrations.Each wholesale supplier of meat sent to the Area Meat Agent on or before the 3rd instant a return showing the number of butchers who have registered with him and permits to buy live stock sufficient to cover the requirements of the retailers registered with him were issued to each wholesale supplier. Supplementary returns of any late registrations will be made by wholesalers.The Area Meat Distribution Committee have power to substitute any classes of meat, imported or otherwise, in place of other meat usually supplied, and to transfer retailers to the suppliers of. such meat for the whole or any portion of their require-ments for any period of time as they think fit, subject to appeal to the National Meat Distribution Committee.It is still too early to indicate with what measure of success the rationing scheme has been established over the whole country, but on the whole&apos; arrangements would appear to be working satisfactorily. Every effort has been made to ensure the provision of sufficient stocks to meet all possible demands in the various provincial centres. It should further be borne in mind that in a large number of districts the prescribed ration represents a material increase in consumption upon the 50 per cent, of the Cabinet sales which has hitherto been permitted.The depletion of Army reserves is likely to cause a certain drain upon supplies, but it is thought that this will not be large enough to cause any serious anxiety.Potatoes. 100 tons of-potatoes have been supplied to the Farina&quot; Mills at Brayford, Lincoln, for the manufacture of farina flour.Sugar. Sir Charles Bathurst has announced  (a) That there is no intention in the early future to reduce the amount of weekly domestic ration of sugar.- a 2
(o) That in making special allotments of sugar through the Local Food Committees under the scheme for providing fruit growers with sugar for domestic preserving, no account will be taken of any sugar saved out of the weekly ration.(c) That the saving of sugar out of the domestic ration for jam making not only does not constitute hoarding, but is a course which is eminently desirable in the public interest under existing circumstances.Tea. A. meeting has been held with the Distribution Sub-Committee of the Tea Advisory Committee to discuss the question of van delivery; and with representative members of the Indian Tea Association to discuss the proposed new contract for the purchase of Indian tea.Food Survey Board. -The Board has recommended (1) That the scale of meat allowed to the Home Army be reduced from 10 ozs.per man per day to 8 ozs. (2) That steps be taken to discover the amount of supplementary food-stuffswhich conscientious objectors receive in parcels from outside andconsume over and above the rations provided. (3) That the sale of food-stuffs in philanthropic huts, hostels, and canteens,should be confined to licensed establishments, and subject to suchconditions as the Food Controller should impose.Organised Distribution.Food Queues. The following figures show the &quot; estimated number of persons attending food queues in the Metropolitan area for the last two weeks and for the week preceding the introduction of rationing :  Dates.	Monday.	Tuesday.	Wednesday.	Thursday.	Friday.	Saturday.18th to 23rd February 25 th to 30th March -1st to 6th April       -	46,316 610	143,933 490 1,740	131,809 &apos; 2,280 2,740	157,223 7,960 1,885	317,158 11,640	542,953 24,340 13,945The demand for unrationed food, particularly cheese, is still responsible for a large percentage of queues. The returns show that the scheme of rationing has almost caused the disappearance of queues for rationed foods.Local Administration. Applications continue to be received for increased labour representation on the Food Control Committees. During the past week 18 cases have come under consideration, and 19 authorities have been issued to committees to increase their members. The suggestion has been made that where the representa-tives of labour and co-operative societies predominate on the committees, the interest of the private trader do not always receive impartial treatment.Rationing. While general satisfaction is expressed with the working of rationing schemes, the strain thrown on the Food Committees and their executive officers has been considerable.The pressure may be expected to relax when the schemes are fairly in working order. Otherwise a considerable increase in staff, both of the Commissioners and the Committees, will be inevitable.Discontent has been aroused in some places by the action of the military authorities in putting soldiers who are now in sedentary occupations on military rations in place of the cash allowances which they formerly received for the purchase of food. Under the new arrangements these ex-soldiers are entitled to an allowance of 4f lbs. of meat per week, while civilians on similar work receive only the much smaller civilian ration. A number of Food Control Committees have protested against the arrangements.The demand for cheese is great, and in some agricultural districts in both England and Scotland an extra ration of cheese would be more welcome than an increased meat allowance. It is hoped that with the increase of the home manufacture of cheese the present position will shortly improve.There are wide-spread complaints with regard to the distribution of tea in many parts of Scotland and England, and temporary rationing schemes have been
. ; aadopted in some areas, pending the decision of the Ministry as to the introduction of a general scheme.Supplementary Rations.-Ori Wednesday, April 10, the Consumers&apos; Council con-sidered the scheme of supplementary meat rations for heavy workers, Colonel Cathcart stating the scientific grounds on which the scheme was based. The Council expressed the opinion that the conclusions of scientific experts were not in themselves a sufficient basis for the exclusion of practically all working women and all adolescent girls from supplementary meat rations, and suggested that the general policy of the Ministry should be to include all women engaged in bodily labour similar in any way to that done by men included in the entitling class. A deputation consisting of the women members of the Council subsequently waited on Mr. Clynes, who promised that their views should have sympathetic consideration.Enforcement of Orders.Eight hundred and eighty-four prosecutions are reported during the week, over half of which were in Ireland. The bulk of the prosecutions were for contraventions of the various orders controlling prices, the butter Order alone accounting for one hundred and twenty-seven cases. The bacon, flour, bread, jam, meat, margarine, and milk (prices) Orders have all contributed freely to the total. The average penalty was, in Ireland fifteen shillings, and elsewhere 51. 5s.Three summonses were issued against Charles Hopkins, Croydon, for obtaining meat, margarine, and sugar contrary to the London and Home Counties (Rationing Scheme) Order, 1918.   A fine of 15Z. or three months&apos; imprisonment avas imposed.The United Creameries, Ltd., Wigtown, manufacturers of margarine, were fined 100Z., and 10Z. lUs. costs for selling wholesale margarine at 124s. per cwt., the maximum price being 93s. 4cZ.At Newcastle, Henry James Cooper Perry, of the Waverley Temperance Hotel, was charged with contravening the Public Meals Order. Fines amoiinting to 55Z. in the aggregate were imposed.At St. Albans, William Edward Allen, of Chipperfield, appealed against a con-viction for food hoarding, and fines amounting to 350Z. and 112Z. costs ordered by the Watford Justices. The Court held that on a charge relating to turtle cup food they could not convict; in each of the 13 other cases there would be a fine of 5Z. and three guineas costs. The Court also ordered two-thirds of the goods in respect of the 13 convictions to be forfeited. The fines, therefore, have been reduced from 350Z. to 65Z., and the costs from 112Z. to 40Z. 19s.Under the Food Hoarding Order, at the Westminster Police Court, A. H. Walker, Ashley Gardens, S.W., was fined 11Z. and 10Z. 10s. costs.Under the Flour and Bread Order, at Alnwick, A. D. Lesbury, was fined 100Z. and 25Z. costs.At Northwich, Messrs. Sandars and Hanley, millers, were fined 103Z. and 3Z. 3s. costs, for selling corn cake exceeding the maximum price.At Glasgow:, Arthur Goodall, baker, was fined 60Z. or two months, for giving short weight and using more than 50 per cent, white imported flour.At Torpoint, Cornwall, five women were fined 5s. each for throwing rice from a window at a wedding party.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.Imports.Imports showed a great improvement in the week ending April 6 th, the aggregate weight of principal foods reaching 241,600 tons, the highest since August 1917 (Table A); the previous week the aggregate was only 110,000 tons.The high total is due to large imports of wheat and sugar. 95,700* tons of wheat and flour arrived, the maximum for this year ; considerable quantities of barley and maize also were received, so that the aggregate weight of cereals imported (including rice) was 140,700 tons.The importation of sugar last week was 66,324 tons ; this is, of course, abnormally high, and it makes the total for the first 14 weeks this year 18 per cent, above that for the corresponding weeks last year.There was a slight falling off in the receipts of beef, compensated by an increase in. those of mutton and of bacon.Consumption.Meat. The supplies of home-fed meat at the four markets included in Table B fell 110 tons in the week ended March 30th, but those of foreign meat rose 1,385 tons. The average for March was equal to that for February, but 4 per cent, below that for January 1918 ; the average for March 1918 was 38 per cent, lower than that for March 1917.At the Central Market the supply of home-fed meat fell 80 tons in tlie week ended April 6th, but the supply of foreign meat increased 880 tons.At the 59 fat stock markets included in Table C the supplies of cattle and of sheep in the week ending April 3rd were in both cases higher than in the previous week, but lower than in the first three weeks of March. As usual we give also statistics arising from a larger number of markets as follows : England and Wales.	Week ended March 23rd.	Week ended March 30th.	Percentage Change.-Number of markets	224	224	Number of cattle stalled	9,068	8,483	- 6*Number of markets             ...	70	70	_Number o  sheep stalled       -      -	9,971	9,099	- 9As compared with last year the number of cattle stalled was 41 per cent, less in the week ended March 30th and 37 per cent, less in the subsequent week, and the number of sheep stalled was 48 per cent, and 44 per cent, less in these weeks.Bread and Flour.   The returns of consumption and sales by bakers and retailers of flour for the four weeks ended March 30th show a very slight fall (0&apos;4 per cent.) as compared with the previous four weeks (Table E). In 1917 the consumption increased 2 per cent, from February to March, and in March was 4f per cent, higher than this year. It will be remembered that March 1917 was unusually cold while March 1918 was mild, and that last year&apos;s dearth of potatoes first became acute in that month ; the greater consumption last year is attributable to these causes.When the difference between the consumption in March this year, and last is analysed, it is found that more than half of the fall is due to a smaller consumption of flour in the Newcastle, Manchester, and Leeds divisions.a If equivalent grain is reckoned instead of flour this number becomes 108,000 tons.

The result of the stock-taking on farms on March 15th is to reveal a consumption somewhat more rapid than was anticipated, and in Table F the estimates formerly given for the whole stock on March 1st have been lowered by 25,000 tons in the case of wheat and 70,000 tons in the case of oats.Stock of Principal Cereals.

This is due to a decrease of imports, not altogether neutralized by decreased consumption.The stock of maize increased during March, but is still 80,000 tons less than last year. On the other hand the stock of rice is 50,000 tons, and of meals 19,000 tons more than last year.The most striking improvement over last year is in the stock of sugar, which was 34,000 tons in 1917 and is now 218,000 tons. &apos;The stocks of beef, mutton, bacon, hams, and poultry, &amp;c, have in each case improved during the month; the aggregate stock of all meats was 112,800 tons on April 1st, 1918,&apos; 91,400 tons on March 1st, 1918, and 94,800 tons on April 1st, 1917.The stock of tea increased 10,000 tons during March, and is now just greater than a year ago. The stocks of coffee and cocoa have diminished and are 18,900 tons and 19,600 tons, respectively, lower than last year.Retail Prices.The retail price of imported beef (Table G) rose about 7 per cent, and of imported legs of mutton rose 11 per cent, during March, while the price of imported breast of mutton fell 5J per cent. Other prices were nearly unchanged except that tea and eggs fell.
