(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRI TAHITI C MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)&quot;&quot; SEC RE T.0*T, 4241. WAR CABINET.MOBILIZATION IN GREECE. Memorandum by Major-Ganeral Sir 0.2. Callwell, g.C.B.;Of the ten divisions contem lated, four have been mobilised and are in the war zone, three are now being mobilised.   There is, however, much difficulty in carrying mobilisation out, owing mainly to lack of clothing and of certain food supplies, as reported by Major-General Reade, our representative in Athens, and by the Frenoh.Under the original arrangements made in Paris last September the material was divided up into three categories:-   (1) YJhat the French would supply, (2) What wo would supply, (3) Material to be found somehow in monthly instalments from other souroes, America if possible.    (1) and (2) have practically all arrived in Greece or are on their way; (3) constitutes the difficulty, and unless this is overcome anything like complete mobilisation will be wholly out of the question.   The United States were recently asked if they could orovide the material but no reply has been received, and it seems doubtful whether this is the right source of supply.   The main items in (3) are:-(a) Oloth, cotton-stuffs, buttons, thread,   The amount is not&apos; large and it could all speedily be su plied by contract from this country were a decision given to that effect.   Total of tonnage well under 2,000 tons, extending over many months.(b) Boot leather for uppers. This we should have to   ask the U.S. to allocate, we undertaking the tonnage; the outside figure is only about 25 tons a month.&apos;(c)   Meat. This is the most serious item.   We must absolutely refuse to find meat except for the troops in the war zone; even so the amount rises from about 500 tons in May to about 1000 tons in August and might reach 1800 tons were all ten divisions fully mobilised and in the field; tinned meat would reduce the totals by 25 per cent.   It is a question of shipping.(d)   Sugar and coffee. The Greeks ou^ht to be able toprocure this Yroin Egypt, ^nd should be allowed to make their own arrangements under oontrol of the Inter-Allied Commission sitting in Athens, shipping themselves.I$ If we undertake (a) and (c), we might make it a conditionthat only seven divisions are to be mobilised before the autumn; by that time we should know if the army will be any good.    This would reduce our commitments in tonnage in respect to flour, meat etc. by roughly 2,000 tons a month.Imperial House,.Kingsway. 13th April, 1918
