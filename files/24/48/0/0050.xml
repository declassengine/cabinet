JJhi$document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Political Intelligence Department, wS^/^^ Foreign Office.CONFIDENTIAL.[April 10, 1918.]lAu! M&amp;M In -Sweden /001.*   0128MEMORANDUM ON SWEDEN AND THE ALAND ISLANDS.FOR humanitarian reasons Swedish troops were landed on the Aland Islands, and, their humanitarian mission having been accomplished, they were removed, a small guard only being left for the security of Russian property. The Swedish Government has consequently succeeded in withdrawing with dignity from a position which had become peculiarly painful through the landing of German troops on these islands.A Blue Book issued by the Swedish Government describes the settlement made through Swedish mediation. From it it would appear that the Swedish expedition conducted the negotiations in a remarkably competent manner, and succeeded fully in attaining their object, namely, the restoration of order and the evacuation of the Poles, Esthonians, and Ukrainians who formed part of the Russian garrison.After the negotiations with the various conflicting elements in the islands had been brought to a successful conclusion, recriminations began. M. Gripenberg, Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires in Stockholm, complained that he had not been kept informed as to the course of events in Aland a complaint which seems to have no real foundation, the Swedish Government being themselves ignorant as to certain points until the full text of the agreement reached them. However this may *be, M. Gripenberg&apos;s protest was contradicted by the Swedish Government. Then M. Vorowski, representative in Stockholm of the Peoples Commissaries&apos; Council in Petrograd, denied the statement of Captain Akermark, one of the leaders of the Swedish expedition, to the effect that he had saved M. Vorowski from arrest by the Russiau troops. Finns and pro-Finnish Swedes complained that the Reds and the Russians had been more favourably treated than the Whites. M. Vorowski declared that the Russian garrison regarded the landing of the Swedes as an attack on them, and the Russian garrison itself maintained that the landing of Swedish troops in the islands was a breach of the agreement. The echos of these recriminations have been reverberating through the Swedish press.With regard to the Finnish question and the German landing on the Aland Islands, Swedish press comments are on the lines one might expect. The Conservative papers blame the Government for refusing to intervene to help Finland. The Liberal point out that intervention would have caused internal dissension in Sweden, and one of them maintains that, in any case, it would have been useless, as clearly a secret understanding existed between Germany and Finland The Socialist papers lay special stress on this latter point, Branting, in &quot; Social-Demokraten,&quot; writing as follows: &quot; Long before the outbreak of civil war, and at the very time when our Government was loyally refusing to take any steps in regard to Aland withoutFinland&apos;s consent, a secret agreement was in existence.....Sweden was to intervene,but only as a creature and ally of Germany.&quot;In this connection a passage from the speech by the Swedish Premier, Eden, at Linkoping, on the 21st March, is of significance, as it gives support to Branting&apos;s statement. Eden stated that Finland had asked help from Germany and Sweden simultaneously, that he could not discuss relations previously existing between Germany and Finland, but that he maintained emphatically that Finland had never regarded Germany as a second string to her bow, but as main helper. Not much reading between the lines is required to understand what was in the Premier&apos;s mind in speaking thus.There is a good deal to be said for the assumption that the simultaneous appeal from Finland to Germany and Sweden resulted from a deep-laid plot, part of which was to force Sweden into line with Germany. Had the Swedish Government inter-vened, the result would certainly have been that Swedish battalions would have been fighting side by side with German in Finland in support of the Whites against the Reds. An awkward situation would thus have arisen, and one that might have been exploited in a reactionary and activist sense, especially as the Swedish corps of officers is Prussian both in its training and mentality.[-367-3]
4f -    *There can be little doubt, too, that had Sweden actively intervened, the extreme Socialists in Sweden would have caused trouble, demanding, from a military point of view, ruthless suppression, and what more natural than that the informal and accidental alliance of the Swedish and German armies in the battlefields of Finland should be cemented by German aid against Swedish Bolshevism V Aland&apos;s occupation has shown the ease with which Germany could bring her forces to bear.Such, at any rate, is the argument of those who still consider the Swedish Activists sufficiently influential to bring about under circumstances favourable to them-a coup d&apos;Etat.Fortunately, the Swedish Government decided not to intervene, and there can be little doubt that the German occupation of the Aland Islands has on the whole alienated Swedish sympathy from Germany. The Swedes are a proud and very sensitive people, and they regard the Aland Islands as their natural heritage. The Germans will probably some day regret that they took action which will be regarded in Sweden as a national humiliation by all, irrespective of party always excepting the very noisy Activist wing of the Conservatives, which is quite disproportionately represented in the Swedish press.It would seem from a speech by Werner Ryden, Socialist Minister of Education, that dangers for the Government are lurking ahead, just from this band of Activists. On the 31st March he addressed a grave warning to labour to watch the course of events. &quot; Certain elements,&quot; he said, &quot;were working quietly to conclude an agreement with the Germans that Sweden should have the Aland Islands and corn from Germany, in return for which Sweden should join the German group of interest. The obstacle to this plan was the present Government, which, these elements said, must be got rid of, but it was urgent that Sweden should not become a vassal State to anyone.&quot; The Minister said, in conclusion, that a storm was brewing, and would soon burst in full fury against the Government.There is a certain significance in these words which cannot be ignored. At the same time, it must be recalled that the elections for the County Councils (which in their turn elect the members to the Upper House of the Riksdag) are soon to take place, and it may well be that M. Ryden has exaggerated the dangers for electioneering purposes.In any case, the near future should show whether the Activists have sufficient support in the country to be a serious menace to the Government. A sure token of their discomfiture would be the conclusion of the general economic agreement between Sweden and the Allied Governments.
