gtM^T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY7 S (XWBRjm&amp;IT),8 ,B. 0 R 35. T, 0.T.-4282,A R     CABINET.TRANSPORT POSITION IN FRANCS*&quot; -       1 &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Memorandum by Major-General sir Rjy^fesh. (Previous Papers:- G.T,4130,&quot; G.T.4176, G.T.4234 &amp; G.T.4248).The maximum amount of Coal which has ever been transported by rail from the Pas de Calais areas South of the Somme appears to have been 900,000 tons per month.   Prior to the commencement of the present offensive, this amount had been1 reduced to some 750,000 tons per month - 700,000 being French Coal from the Pes de Calais mines, 50,000 English Coal im ;orted throagh the ports of Calais and Boulogne.   The maintenance of the Coal supply in areas South of the Somme up to the extent necessary to maintain at full pressure Prance1s war effort, is obviously essential.The result of tke enemy1s endeavour to sever oommunica-tions between the British Army in the Pas de Calais and the French Army has been so far successful as to reduoo the means of communication between North and South to the capacity of one line of double-track railway.     The enemy on the other hand, has many alternative lateral lines of communication open to him and it becomes absolutely necessary, from the purely military point . of view, to immediately free the single North and South lateral in Allied hands from all but military traffic.     This means that the whole of the Coal traffic from the Pas de Calais to the area South of the Somme must irmnodiately be shut down.It is possible that later Goal traffic will be resumed,: But as the mines in the Pas de Calais are already within range of the enemyrs guns&apos;, the only safe assumption to make in con-sidering the future position is that no. Coal will be available from the Pas de Calais either for the area South of tho Somme Or for the area in which the British Army are now operating.The French Minister of Armaments (who is responsible for the control of Coal supply in France^ states that ill order to make good the loss of the Pas. de Calais mines, it will be necessary to import from England 600,000 tons of Coal per month.       He claims that this figure has been arrived at after taking into consideration the further economies in the constimption of Coal it is possible for him to introduce, the greater output which it will be possible to   roduce in the South of France, and the transfer of Coal at present im-ported at the ports of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk to ports South of the Somme.    It will be observed that in arriving at this figure, the difference in the quality of British and of French Coal does not appear to have been taken into account. It would appear possible, therefore, if suitable qualities of English Coal are sent to France to make a considerable cut from a figure of 600,000 tons, seeing that it is generally admitted that ^ood quality British Coals are some 20 per cent higher In calorific value than the best Coals won in the Pas de Calais mines.
In these circumstances, two separate problems here been discussed with the Coal Controller and the Minister of Shipping:-(1)   What can be done immediately to export Coal from the United Kingdom to France in order to ensure that the Coal traffic from the Pas de Calais shall be immediately stopped.(2)   &apos;v:h t can be done as a more permanent arrangement if the Pas de Calais mines are rendered useless to the Allies.As regards the first of these enquiries:   it has been ascertained that the Ccal Controller is in a position to guarantee the supply during the next fortnight of Coal st the rate of 30U,000 tons per mensem,     That&apos;the Shipping Controller ie in a position to transport this quantity to France, &quot;and that the French Ports South of the Somne will be able to receive it.   Further than this, the C-el Controller thinks It possible that he may be able, during the next fortnight, to increase the figure Of 300,000 tons per mensem to 400,000 per mensem, while if the larger amount is forthcoming the Shipping Controller could trans-port it and the French,ports receive it.   In addition, it is considered possible immediately to di/ert the ships at presont carrying Coal from England to the ports of Boulogne. Calais s-d Dunkirk to the ports further South, which will increase the supply in the South at the rate of some hundred thousand tons per mensem at least..The measure of assistance which ;ve are, in thsse cir-eumstaaces, immediately able to give to the French, would appear to justify us in asking that the transport of Coal from the Pas da Calais to areas South of the bowme should immediately be shut down,as regards a more permanent arrangement, it is under-stood that the Coal Controller sees his way to meet, if necessary, the full French demand for 600,000 tons in the areas South of the Somme, and in addition 150,000 tons per mensem for the areas Jlorth of the Somme in v.-hich the British Army are operating. This contribution can only be made, however, subject to the following provisos in regard to the comb out of Coal Miners: -The comb out of the first 50,000 now proceeding may be completed.     As regards the second 50,000 which it was pro-posed to comb out during May;   it must, however, be stipulated *that not more than 25,000 Coal Miners shall be taken unless and * until the Coal Controller can agree to an increase over this i figure.     Further the number of men fixed by the ballot for 25,000 men as the quota of each particular pit, must in no cir-cumstances be exceeded.     To ensure this, volunteers must be refused where their acceptance would mean an increase over the ballot number from any particular pit.It is impossible for the Minister of Shipping to say at present whether he could arrange for the transport of the full quantity of 750,000 tons to France.    He is, however, examining the question and it will be possible shortly to say exactly what quantity of Coal he is in a position to carry.There appears to be some difference of opinion between French and British experts as to the quantity of Coal which it would be possible to discharge in French Ports.   It does net seem possible to ezrive at an agreement en th*, matt ex without personal discussion between representatives of the two Govern-ments.
It is &quot;believed that the English Railways will he able to carry to British ports the full quantity of 750,000 tons per month.   This is a large figure, however, involving a considerable additional strain upon the resources of English Railways, and it would be advisable that a complete examination cf the matter 3hould be made before any definite promise is made to the French.There appears no reason to suppose that the French Railways will not be able to transport the full quantity of 750,000 tons per month from French ports.   This quantity is less than they formerly conveyed from the Pas de Calais, and the lead from the ports to the centres of consumption will probably be somewhat leas on the   average than the lead from the Pas de Calais mines to the same centres.It will be seen from the above resume of the position that the following matters remain to be settled:-(l)    It is necessary at once to press the French to shut down absolutely the Coal traffic from the Pas de Calais mines.(2)    It is necessary to come to an agreement with the French regarding the quantity of Coal to be ex-ported from the United Kingdom to France in the event of the pas de Calais mines being put out of action.    This agreement to take into account the better quality of the Coal to be supplied from the United Kingdom.(3)    It is necessary to ascertain definitely for what quantity of Coal shipping from the United Kingdom to France can be found after the first fortnight.(4)   It is necessary to come to an agreement with the French as to whether the full quantity required can be discharged at French ports,  and if so,  at what ports,  and how much at each.i(Sgd.)

AMM TO 0,To;4B82&apos; Qopy of - letter from Ma^pr-jfeneral Sir B.A,H,Nrxh toHfotf g^cTotary,/WrTalbine&quot;t,&apos;  &quot;ijlmbankment Annexe,S.W./1 19th April,1918Sear Hankey,Since I saw yon this afternoon, I have received them the Goal Controller, the minute of which J  enclose a copy.     This elaborates somewhat what I said in my note regarding the provisos under which the Coal Controller can supply 750,000 tons of   coal per mensem to France.     Perhaps you v.-ould add the substance of the Coal Controller?e minute to the minute which I left with you.Yours sincerely, .(Sgd. )P*AeMpM3HItw-Ool. Sir Maurice Eankey, Z-B-C.B., Secretary to the War Cabinet, 2,Whitehall Gardens, S0Wd1* The demand for next week or two is at the rate of300,000 tons per month.The Coal Mines Department will have no difficulty, and if ships are available, the Department Fill endeavour to get up to the -rate of 400,000 tons per month.2* Possible requirement of 750,000 tons per month.The view of the Coal Mines Department is thatIs The April quota of men need not be interfered witha-   2. Of the second 50,000, 25,000 men may be posted in May provided -(a) That no volunteers in excess of the quota of each mine are accepted.Note * -In this connection, National Service have hitherto said that their Department cannot refuse volunteerss but the Coal Mines Department urge that the Ministry-of National Service is responsible for the best use of Man-power, whether for coal getting or Military purposes and there should be no difficulty in declining to accept Mining recruits unless they pre-.sent either a calling up notice or a chit furnished by the Manager of the Mine that they have been drawn in the ballot.(b) That the demobilisation of the Pre-War Miners of low grade goes on currently vzith the posting of the recruits, and thereafter the Coal Mines Department will release more men in blocks as and when and where the Department can get the economies effected under rationing.(The effect of the rationing scheme cannot be seen -until the middle or the end of June). butWith the Pas de Calais situation at its worst, the Coal Mines Department&quot;can ultimately still let 35,000 of the second of the 50,000 go, and exceed this to the extent to which Demobilisation progresses, taking into consideration the poorer physique of the demobilised men.
3?he Ooal liines Department believe the ratio to be JJIVE demobilised mon to THREE 01a3s &quot;An men.In so far as General Hash can got the 750,000 tone reduced the Goal Mines department will agree torelease at the rate of about 1,000 men for every 30,000 tons reduction.\
