Will you help me to obtain the necessary decision?   It is a most urgent matter.The enclosed memorandum (iii) sets out tho details;   but the gist of it is this:-(1) Makers must be allowed higher prices for suiphato of ammonia and superphosphate from June 1st next, owing to the increased cost of sulphuric acid,(2) The amount of this incroaso has not yet been definitely set-tied by the Ministry of Munitions;   but on the year&apos;s output of the two fertilisers it will mean an increaso of from 2^ to 2t\ million pounds over the prices of the year ending May 31.
todLj3vtr&quot;&quot;pscy ^prices representing increases of on-^hs current year, and the rise would mean fertiliser would not be taken up, with results disastrcue production.   The rige on 1913 prices would be, in the of sulphate of ammonia, from 53$ to 64$, and of superphos-;ea from 182$ to 206$.(4)   Iatthe will rence... suggest that prices for 1918-19 should be kept current season1s level (already very high), and I hope you be able to obtain sanction for the proposal that the diffe should be borne by the Treasury 6(5)   If the prices of fertilisers are raised, the farming com-munity will justly demand corresponding rises in the maximum prices of the product.   Consumers would resent such a rise in price; but, if it were not conceded, there is a danger that the produce would not be grown.(6)   A prompt decision is necessary if we are to set up a system of controlled distribution that will meet railway needs by reducing haulage.Sincerely yours,(Sgd.)   R.E. PBOTHBRO.The Right Hon.The Viscount Milner, G.C.B., G.C.M.G.(iii)Memorandum by Food Production DepartmentThis Department and the Ministry of Munitions are agreed that increased cost of manufacture of these two fertilisers juetTfy heavy advances in the prices to be charged to farmers for the new agricultural year beginning June let,the1918.The following table gives the current prices (year 1917-10) and two alternative prices for 1918-19.   The Department-ana the Ministry of Munitions are satisfied that one of these twc increase prices must be granted to makers according to whether the price of sulphuric acid is fixed on the lower or higher scale.Sulphate of AmmoniaSuperphosphatePrice per ton to farmers in-oluding deliveryPercentage of Increase !in price of 1918-19 eve the price in1918-19   j   1916-19191^18*(a) if extra on aoid is on lower scale21.0.0. 8 .36 .6 .(b) if extra on acid is on higher scale22.10.0 9.11.616.0.0. 6. .10.0 .acidas (a)31$ 36 icid as(*)41$ 47$191acidas (a)ac a53$ 103$64 206
In the course of the agricultural year beginning- June 1st 1918. the cost of sulphuric acid and bags may rise still further. Makers reasonably ask to be guaranteed a corresponding increase in the price of the fertilisers, but it is essential that prices shall be fixed by Order of tho Ministry of Munitions for the whole of the agricultural year, June 1st 1918 - May 31st 1919, so that farmers may ;:nov what their cultivation oosts per acre will be.Tho Food Production Department, after consultation with the Scottish and Irish Departments of -sericulture, is satisfied that the prices given above for 1918-19 on either scale are so excessive from the farmers&apos; point of view that the fixing of either of thorn by-Order would seriously prejudice the success of the food Production programme.     It is almost certain that the available supplies, especially of superphosphata, would not be taken up by the farmerm at these prices *    Farmers aro already much alarmed at the high cost of labour and its increasing shortage, and would claim that fertilisers at prohibitive prices in conjunction with fixed prices for thoir products had mado food production unremunerative.Two alternative policies are suggested;-(1)    The fixing of maximum prices for the fertilisers, aft- C&quot; follows: -Sulphate of ,&apos;lmmonia     *.     *.      19. 10. 0. per ton.Superphosphate   ?. 10. 0.   M     &quot;(2)     The maintenance, of maximum prices,at thoi levelsiof &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Hbhe currenT&quot;yearL&quot;19ly-lQ*The charges on public funds involved would be -Policy (1)If Acid orioos are fixed at lower rsto     1,125,000 &quot;     &quot;   &quot;   w      &quot;      &quot;   . n higher   &quot;       1,905,000Policy (2)If acid prices are fixed at lower rato      2,495,000 &quot;     &quot;        &quot;       &quot;it       n higher   &quot;        3,275,000and in the event of further rises in costs of acid or bags during the year 1918-19, suoh rises would also fall upon public funds.If Policy (1) were adopted, it is just possible the output of superphosphate might be taken up, and probable that the sulphsto of ammonia would bo.     The Department desires to point out, however, that a rise in fertiliser prices for tho oeriod 1918-19 would produce a prompt demand from farmers for rises in the prices fixed by the Food Con-troller for all agricultural produce (grain, potatoes, meat, milk) while the continuance of existing fertiliser prices would enablo tho Government tho better to resist such demands. If tho higher price for Acid is to obtain, tho percentage of increase in the price to the farmer as oonwarod with 1913 would be 64$ on sulphato of ammonia, and20^ on superphosphate. The principal argument for maintaining existing prices must be, however, the need for ensuring for the increasing of crops tho free utilisation of the suoplies available, and the Department presses for a decision in favour of policy (2),   Justification for a grant from public funds for this purpose lies in the fact
that the increased cost of production is dixwtly ftue to the war, and to SoTernraent control of imports and  poikjsete of the. raw materials.     In the case of basic 8la&amp;, which is a home product, the increases in cost are compararti^PeJLy trifling, and no objection is raised by farmers.In practice the allowances necessary to enafcie fertilisers to be manufactured at the prices suggested in Policy ( &apos;) Tjould be l-soc by the kinistry of Munitions issuing materials tc manufacturers at prices below the actual cost 01 importation and not by a direct money grant.Food Production Department April 12th, 1S16.
