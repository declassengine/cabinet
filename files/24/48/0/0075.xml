Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES? IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1918

Week ended 17th April, 1918

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

TILLAGE DEFAULTERS

The work of inspecting holdings is proceeding.

During the past week the Department have effected conacre lettings, i.e. lettings for 1918 corn and potato crops, on a few holdings on which they had entered because of the failure of the occupiers to cultivate the area prescribed by the Tillage Orders. In many cases the Inspectors have reported that when, pursuant to their instructions, they have visited farms for the purpose of taking possession on behalf of the Department, ploughing of grass land was in progress, and that considerable areas had been ploughed during the period which had elapsed since their previous inspection. It is again evident from the general reports furnished by the Department&apos;s Land Inspectors that many occupiers, who early in the season had not taken adequate steps to plough up the prescribed area of their grass lands, have since d? so, either by means of tracters, or by hiring the men and horses of neighbours who have completed the ploughing of their lea lands.

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Thirty applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£26,570.

PROGRESS OF TILLAGE OPERATIONS.

Planting of potatoes and sowing of grain crops have proceeded at a normal rate. Ploughing is still being done on large grass farms in compliance with the Department&apos;s Tillage Orders.

SUPPLIES OF ARTIFICIAL MANURES.

The shortage of sulphate of Ammonia and Superphosphate has become more pronounced with the progress of the sowing season. The Department have issued a poster and leaflet to all traders in

17/4/18.
fertilisers recommending the use of Basic Slag and Nitrate of Soda as substitutes where Superphosphate and sulphate of Ammonia cannot be procured.

FLAX.

A consignment of about 240 tons (equal to about 5,120 bags) of Russian Flaxseed of 1917 growth recently arrived in Belfast. Further consignments of new Dutch seed have also arrived, bringing the total quantities of such seed received to about F?C 20,000 bags.

The Report of the Departmental Committee on Charges for Scutching Flax and Disposal of Tow has been presented to Parliament, and, it is expected, will be available for issue about the beginning of next week.

TRANSIT OF FARMING REQUISITES.

During the past week representations were received in regard to the conveyance of ploughs, plough parts, agricultural seeds and artificial manures. The necessary action was taken in each case.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 9th to 15th inst., inclusive, 463 applications for licences to slaughter or export animals under the Order relating to breeding sows were received and 431 licences were issued. During the same period 14? applications for licences to export milch cows and 115 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers were received. Twenty applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks were also received.
