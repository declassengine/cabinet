(Reference War Cabinet 594, Minute 8)On the 17th April I was requested by the War Cabinet to settle the question of the prices of Sulphate of Ammonia, (G.T. 4243).On the 18th April I called a Meeting of representa-tives of all the departments concerned.   The Board of Agriculture, the Pood Production Department, the Scottish and Irish Offices, the Ministry of Pood, and Explosives Branch of the Ministry of Munitions were represented.   The Treasury informed me that they thought it unnecessary to be represented at the Meeting, and I proceeded to deal with the matter in their absence.All the Departments strongly supported the proposalof the Pood Production Department that the prices for the   1season of 1918-19 should not exceed those of last season -the difference in price between the years 1917-18 and 1918-19 being borne by the Treasury.After hearing the arguments by which this proposal was supported, I decided that it would not be consistent with the policy the Government had already adopted in regard to the increased production of food and the limitation of prices (and more particularly bread prices), to increase the price of fertilisers, and I decided that the maximum prices for fertilisers from the period 1st June to the 31st Hay 1919, should be maintained at the level of the current&apos; year 1917/1918, and that the difference in cost should be borne by the State.I also decided that in the event of further rises in costs of acid or bags during the year 1918-19 the increased cost should fall upon public funds unless the increase were of such a serious character as to require a reconsideration of the question.I desire to record my opinion that a representative, of the Chancellor of the Exchequer ought always to be present.when such questions have to be decided.(signed)     AUSTBN CliAlSBilRLAlN.2, Whitehall Gardens,19th April, 1918.
