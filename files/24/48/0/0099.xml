k ./ MEMORANDUM BY MINISTRY OP SHIPPING. Diversion cf Fast Passenger Ships from Canada to New York.the circumstances in which action was taken by the Ministry of Shipping to remove from the Canada/UJl. run to the New York run certain fast passenger ships, and replace them r/ith -slower ships, are detailed in the telegram dated 8th April attached to the Memorandum of the Secretary of State for the Colonies dated the 18th April, 1918.Following on the War Cabinet meeting of the 29th March, the Ministry of Shipping has treated the question of the increased transportation of American troops as of the most urgent national importance.       In these circumstances prior notification to the Canadian Government, with the inevitable consequent discussion in view of the opposition of        interested parties, was considered to be out of the question.I fully agree that in all normal circumstances the Canadian Government ought to be consulted before changes are made (Effecting Dominion interests.     It will however be for the Tfrar Cabinet to decide whether the unqualified assurance desired by the Canadian Government (asked for as it is in relation to this exceptional case of sudden emergency) is one which can safely be given.Subject to the views of the War Cabinet on this latter&apos; point I would suggest that the terms of the reply to be sent to the Canadian Government should be settled by Mr. Walter Long and myself in consultation.(sgd) J.P.Maclay.20th April, 1918.
