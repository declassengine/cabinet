CANADA.Ontario Provincial Elections-Oa. 23rd October the High Commissioner was informed by the Director of Information at Ottawa that the Ontario Provincial Elections had resulted in the defeat of the Government of Sir William Hearst; the Premier and four other Ministers having failed to obtain re-election. The strength of the parties now elected is as follows : Conservatives 27, Liberals 28, United Farmers 43, Independents 2.. The Prohibition Referendum for the retention of the&quot; existing restrictions on the sale of intoxicating liquor was carried by a large majority, the rural constituencies being overwhelmingly in its favour.The Dominion House of Commons. The High Commissioner was also informed on 23rd October that the Hon. Sir Henry Drayton, the new Dominion Minister of Finance, and the Hon. Mackenzie King, Leader of the Opposition, had been elected to the House of Commons without opposition.The International Labour Conference at Washington. On 18th October the Duke of Devonshire, Governor-General of Canada, informed Lord Milner that the Hon. Newton W. Rowell, K.C., M.P., Acting Secretary of State for External Affairs and President of the Privy Council, and the Hon. Gideon D. Robertson, Minister of Labour and Senator, would be the Delegates of the Government of Canada to the International Labour Conference which would meet at Washington on 29th October.Trade Returns. On 23rd October the High Commissioner was informed by the Director of Information that the excess of exports from Canada over imports into the Dominion during the first six months of the current fiscal year amounted to $127,000,000.Canadian Banlts. On 16th October the High Commissioner was informed by the Director of Information that the Canadian Chartered Banks had opened 65 new branches during September, and that the Royal Bank- of Canada intended to open several branches in Brazil.Revenue and War Expenditure. The High Commissioner was also informed on 16th October that the ordinary revenue for the six months ending 30th September was $159,000,000 as compared with $140,000,000 for the corresponding period last year. The war expenditure for the six months ending 30th September amounted to &quot;$183,000,000.Shipbuilding. The High Commissioner was further informed on 16th October that the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company was arranging to enlarge its shipyards in order to provide for the construction of vessels of 10,000 tons, and that important Seattle shipbuilding interests had been instituting inquiries at Montreal with a view to the establishment there of large shipbuilding yards, representing both Canadian and American capital.AUSTRALIA.Shipping Requirements.--The Governor-General of the ,Commonwealth, tele-graphed on 23rd October that his Prime Minister has received complaints from the rabbit shippers that the promises of freight, made to them as a consideration for their agreement to the cancellation of the unfulfilled portion of the 1918 contract, have not been observed. Consequently there is a large accumulation of frozen rabbits, estimated at 12,000 tons, awaiting shipment, with the prospect of a total of 1,000 tons to be shipped weekly from Sydney and Melbourne in the first half, of next year. The position is serious because storage space is exhausted, and certain works have been closed, causing unemployment. The Government ask for early provision of shipping to meet their requirements.Meat Contracts. The Governor-Gieneral of the Commonwealth on 10th October -transmitted to Lord Milner a message in regard to the meat contracts, from his Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes, who said that producers, finding themselves in an unfair
position, were daily pressing for some sign of relief. Those interested in the export of meat had acted on the Government notification to stock owners that contracts would expire on 28th September, the date&apos;on which the Argentine contracts were determined. A new contract had, however, been made with the Argentine, and on better terms than those contained in the existing Australian contract. The Commonwealth Government once again pointed out that during the war Australia had supplied all her staple products below the market price, but now that peace had been ratified she was entitled to be treated at least as favourably as any foreign country. Seeing that Britain could purchase from Australia at the same price per head as from the Argentine, it was surely not too much to ask that she should give the preference to the former.NEW ZEALAND.New Cabinet. The Cabinet has been reconstructed Prime Minister - - -Defence and Finance Native Affairs and Customs Public Works ....Attorney-General and Education -Lands -        -Internal Affairs - -Agriculture -        -        -Justice and Postmaster-General   -Member of the Executive Council represent-ina; the native races      - - -as follows :-Mr. W.

On 21st October Lord Liverpool, Governor-General of New Zealand, reported that his Government proposed to levy a special surtax on goods of nearly all classes coming from late enemy countries, as it wished to discourage trade between New Zealand and Germany. An amendment was being proposed to section 28 of the New Zealand Finance Act, 1915. The tax would be a heavy one, but the amendment provided that it should be less than 50 per cent.SOUTH AFRICA.The Indian Commission--On 23rd October the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in regard to the Indian Commission. - Lord Buxton said that his Ministers had informed him that the contemplated Commission would deal with the question of trading and trading licences as affecting Asiatics, with a view to securing uniform treatment in the four provinces. It was not intended that the terms of reference should cover any other matter or grievance, and in view of this limitation of the scope of the Commission it did, not appear (? necessary) to add an Indian to the gentlemen who would represent the Indian Government in an advisory capacity.He added, that his Ministers liad. stated that it was their intention that the Commission (which would have a Judge of the Supreme Court as Chairman) should begin its labours soon after the commencement of the new year.Post-War Problems. Telegraphing from Pretoria on 14th October, ReuteFs agent reported that the following official announcement had been issued there that day :-The Government, being desirous of ascertaining the effect on the cost of living and on industrial trade conditions of the exchange rate arising out of the war, have decided, to call a conference to advise them regarding firstly the feasibility and desirability of establishing natural exchange rates between the Union and the rest of the world and the probable effect thereof, and secondly the possi-bility of establishing a free market for gold in the Union and the measures necessary thereto and to prevent the drainage of gold coin from the Union. The Minister of Finance; Mr. Qrr, will preside over the conference, at which representatives of the various interests concerned will be invited to attend.
Development of Agricultural Resources. Telegraphing from BJoemfontein on 22nd October, Reuters agent reports that the Unionist Congress has passed a resolution in favour of the vigorous development of the agricultural resources of the country by means of closer settlement and a systematic and continued introduction of British settlers. The Congress also favoured the taxation of- land values. Sir Thomas Smartt was re-elected President.General Smuts&apos; Principles accepted by the Unionist Congress.- In another telegram dated 23rd October Reuters agent reports as follows: The Unionist Congress unanimously adopted a motion wholeheartedly welcoming and accepting the principles which General Smuts laid clown on 17th September, and particularly adopting the fundamental principles of frank, honest and wholehearted co-operation between the white races, of mutual respect for others&apos; traditions and ideals, and of national unity and patriotism based on the strong spirit of a South African nation. The motion further condemned any propaganda aiming at a subversion of the Onion&apos;s-Constitution, and recorded the conviction that the continuance of such propaganda must eventuallylead to bloodshed.The Free State Nationalist Conference.  On 16th October ReuteFs Bloemfontein agent reported that the Free State Nationalist Conference had that day passed a resolution reasserting the Free State&apos;s right to independence, and urging the discontinuance of the Union&apos;s contribution to the Imperial Navy.The Gold Question. ReuteFs ,agent sends the following information from Pretoria, dated 24th October : The Economic Conference, called by the Government and presided over by Mr. Orr, Minister of Finance, has passed two resolutions. The first is to the effect that the establishment of natural exchanges and a free market for gold in the Union is desirable; that to this end, the establishment of a mint aud refinery should be proceeded with with the utmost despatch ; that gold producers be requested to take steps to secure a modification of their selling agreement with the Bank of England so as to permit its termination at short notice ; that the embargo on the export of specie from the Union should not be continued after the establishment of a mint. The second resolution favours a uniform Bank Act for the whole of the Union with stringent provisions against any inflation of the currency.The Drouglit. From Capetown on 25th October, Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphs the following: The present drought, which is described as the worst for 50 years, prevails over large areas of the Cape Province, the Free State and the Transvaal. FarmeVs are suffering heavy losses in livestock. The crops, which already are very poor, will, it is estimated, show a shortage of production for the whole Union of 33 per cent.Sword of Honour for GVneral Smuts. Telegraphing from Pretoria on 16th October, ReuteFs agent reported that there had been a distinguished and crowded assembly that day in the Town Hall, when the Mayor, amid scenes of great enthusiasm, presented to General Smuts the sword of honour which had been subscribed for by the citizens.In the course of his reply General Smuts dwelt with pride on South Africa&apos;s part in the war and the provision that had been made for returned soldiers, who, he added, would be absorbed without difficulty. In conclusion, he expressed the opinion that the Union had received an absolutely adequate asset in exchange for the .15,000,000 . spent in conquering Germ an South-West Africa.INDIA.Turkish Peace Terms. On 15th October the Alceroy reported that, stimulated by the pro-Turkish party in Europe, there had been a considerable revival of feeling in regard to the Turkish Peace Terms. The Bombay Caliphate Committee appeared to be preparing agitation, and on 18th September a meeting of some 10,000 Moslems was held in Bombay under its auspices. This meeting would have been of a formal nature but for the remarkable speech of one Gandhi, a Hindu. He told the audience that they had failed in their duty in not making their voices heard. The future of the Caliphate and the Holy Places were questions of life and death to them, and they
had-not realized that they had the support of 21 crores1 of Hindus, who would enable them to dictate what terms they pleased with every hope of success. His final advice to the meeting was to put heart and soul into the agitation. In the next issue of his newspaper he followed up what he had said and urged the Moslems to draw up their minimum demands and present them as a clear-cut issue.This action has produced a change of tone in the Bombay Moslem papers. In other provinces there are also indications of a.revival of agitation. Moslem papers are exercised over the secrecy of the peace terms and the dismemberment of Thrace. The main resolution at the Lucknow meeting of the All-India Moslem League declared that the spiritual position of the Sultan as Caliph was indissolubly bound up with his temporal power, and that it was &apos; an intolerable interference with the Caliph to create small States with non-Moslem Powers as mandatories. At a meeting held at Madras on 5th September the Turkish flag was hoisted and prayer was offered for the preservation of the Holy Places and the victory of the Sultan. Reports of increased unrest over this question had also been received from Delhi, Assam and Burma,. The prolonged tension was having an undesirable effect, though it was doubtful whether the masses were as yet genuinely stirred.Economic Conditions [B.E.R. ii. 6J. Telegraphing on 17th October, the Viceroy reported that gratuitous relief in all the affected districts of Central Provinces except Raipur and Drug, relief works in the Angul District of Bihar and Orissa, relief operations in the Sholapur District of the Bombay Presidency, and the Government fodder depots in the Maharatwara Districts of Hyderabad, had been closed. The situation had further improved in Hyderabad where good spring crops were expected. Crops were generally satisfactory, but rain was needed in the Punjab. Also that the numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal: works, 3,265 ; gratuitous, 7,734. Bihar and Orissa: works, 6,585 ; gratuitous, 48,175. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 6,022 ; gratuitous, 22,716. Central India : works, 3,100 ; gratuitous, 7,700. Central Provinces (incomplete figures): works, 12,985; gratuitous, 5,305. Bombay: works, 2,900 ; gratuitous, 19,671. Hyderabad : works, 17,000 ; gratuitous, 25,000.&quot; Madras : works, 59,706; gratuitous (incomplete figures) 91,875.Telegraphing again on 24th October he reported that test works in Bihar and Orissa, relief works in the Manila District of the Central Provinces and the Ahmednagar District of Bombay Presidency, and some camps in Hyderabad, had been closed. Also that the numbers relieved, were as follows : Bengal: works, 4,319; gratuitous, 4,914. &quot;Bihar and Orissa: works, 2,632; gratuitous, 45,844. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 5,819;&apos; gratuitous, 20,027. Central India: works, 3,000; gratuitous, 7,100, Central Provinces: works, 7,827; gratuitous, 5,754. Bombay: works, 2,685; gratuitous, .15,113. Hyderabad: works, 15,000; gratuitous, 20,000. Madras (incomplete figures): works, 56,688; gratuitous, 85,794,Prospects were everywhere favourable except that the Rabi Area in. the Punjab might be below normal owing to the early cessation of the rains. Prices still remained high, but showed a downward tendency. The difficulties as to supplies appeared to be at an end everywhere, except in Bengal and a few isolated areas, such as Coorg and Hyderabad.CROWN COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Lord MilneSs Commission. On 23rd October Sir Milne Cheetham reportec. [No. 14-93] that some members of the] Extremist party had recently approached the Prime Minister to ascertain his attitude in regard to. Lord Milner&apos;s Commission. According to the local Press he had informed them that he had protested against the sending of the Commission as not only, undesirable but useless at a time when the affairs of the Near East were unsettled, and that in this he had the1 One ovore ^ 10,000,000. B
support, of the Sultan. In reply to a further question as to his attitude in the event of a Commission being sent despite his protest, lie is reported to have said that this would render his position impossible, a*s it would signify lack of confidence in himself on the: part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In. regard to this, Sir Milne Cheetham said that Mohammed Said had never-concealed the fact that he was opposed to the proposed. Commission. His recent declaration, however, had. excited unusual interest.Strike of Railway Men. On -24th October Sir Milne Cheetham reported [No. 1498] that there was a likelihood of at least a partial strike on the Egyptian State Railways,, and that at short notice. There was considerable reason for thinking that political agitation and a state of unrest due to, rumours of the arrival of Lord Milner s Commission were responsible for the attitude of the railwaymeu.Officials had met the men representing particular sections who had put forward-fresh demands, such for instance as the telegraphists and the signalmen. On a number of points satisfaction had been given, but in regard to others it had proved impossible to meet the when&apos;s demands without a general rise of wages in the public services following.Two days later he reported [No. 1506] that there had been a partial strike which had caused a stoppage, of trains in lower Egypt, but work had been resumed by practically all the men. .German Property. On 23rd October Lord Curzon instructed Sir Milne Cheetham as follows [No. 1174] :--1. Section 4 of Part X. of German Treaty will apply to Egypt, and therefore the-liquklation. of German property in Egypt may be authorized by appropriate legislation in accordance with Article 297 (6). Presumably this will be done by Proclamation of the General Officer Commanding.2. The proceeds of the liquidation when completed will not be confiscated, but will be charged with liability for the payment of certain claims on Germany in accordance with Article 297 (h) (2) and paragraph 4 of the Annex and dealt with accordingly.3. The proposal is being urged that the Treasury should agree to grant immunity of personal property of ex-enemy diplomatists. The same policy should therefore be followed by you, and you will be informed when a decision is arrived at.4. The German delegate on the Caisse de la Dette being present in Egypt as the representative of his Government forthe&apos; purpose of the Caisse, which owed its existence to an international agreement, should be treated on the same footing as an enemy diplomatist.5. German property deposited with the Swedish agencies should be treated upon the same footing as other property of the same kind. If its nature was such that it-would be entitled to immunity as diplomatic, or for any other reason, the fact of its depository with the Swedish agencies should not prejudice it: whilst the fact that it was deposited with these agencies should, not give any additional security.6. Individuals who have automatically acquired the nationality of a new State-under the Austrian Peace Treaty will not be affected by the provisions of Article 249, which corresponds with Article 297 of the German Treaty.   The nationality provisions in the Austrian Treaty are more complicated than in the German, and it will be found that Article 249 (6), third paragraph, makes special provision for these cases.CYPRUS. - -Cyprus and GVeece.-On 13th October the Acting High Commissioner for Cyprus reported that a meeting of Greek Christian delegates representing the Cyprus villages had been held in Nicosia at the Archbishop&apos;s palace on 12th October and a resolution passed, for the union of Cyprus with Greece, telegrams on the subject being subsequently despatched to the Prime Minister and others. He had ascertained, from various letters which had been submitted to him in the course of censorship that the meeting was not the result of any local spontaneous feeling, but had been organized by a local committee instructed by the deputation of the Greek. Christian members of the Legislative Council which is at present in England. These delegates had stated that they wished to have their position strengthened by
resolutions from. Cyprus, but that the committee must not divulge the fact that the deputation had inspired this, as it was important that the responsible advisers of His Majesty should have the impression that any such resolution was passed by a united people without dictation. Great care should, they said, be taken to avoid giving the impression that it was the work of agitators. He had received com-munications from Moslems emphatically protesting against the Greek Christian agitation for union with Greece and earnestly asking that the British rule in Cyprus should be continued.ADEN.Colonel Jacob&apos;3 Mission. On 24th October the Resident at Aden reported [telegram unnumbered] an improvement in the attitude of the Arabs in the Hodeidah Hinterland. Except among the Quhra tribe, who persisted in their demand for the return of the Turks, the evacuation of Hodeidah and the supply of arms, the feeling is now much more friendly. He added that Major Meek had been offered a safe conduct to Bajil.In a later telegram [unnumbered] of the same date the Resident stated that Major Meek reported having received an unsatisfactory communication from the Quhras which, although not shutting the door on further negotiations, led. to his opinion that military preparations should be begun.
