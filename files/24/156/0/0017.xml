The Labour Situation. The following paragraphs ate taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 5th May 1920 : (1) General Survey of the Week. Tire most important feature of the situation continues to be negotiation with regard to wages.. The claims of the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen for wage advances were considered by the Central Wages Board on the 4th May, and as-it proved impossible to reach an agreement, it was decided to refer the application, to the National Wages Board. Conferences of the employers and the trade unions in the cotton industry have taken place and some progress has been made towards a settlement.Unrest caused by the continued increase in food prices is again on the increase, and it .nray be expected that when the cost of living index number for May is published it may be used as a ground for demanding further wage increases&apos;in certain industries. An important feature of the situation is the holding of a full conference of the executives of the constituent bodies of the Triple Alliance on the 6th May. The subjects to be discussed at this meeting are the proposals put forward by the N.U.R. with reference to the extension of the Alliance and the question of high prices. The sub-committee of the Alliance met on the 5th instant, in preparation for the full meeting on the 6th.(2) Labour Women and Race Prejudice. A meeting was held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 27th April, to protest against the use of black troops in Europe. The meeting was held under the auspices of the Women&apos;s International League, the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild, the National Federation of Women Workers, the Federation of Women Teachers, the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries, and the Fabian Women&apos;s group. A resolution was passed calling upon the League of. Nations to prohibit the importation into Europe for warlike purposes of troops belonging to primitive peoples, and their use anywhere except for the purpose of police and defence in the country of their origin. A letter was read from M. Longuet supporting the protest.(3) May-day Celebrations. A very large number of May-day celebrations took place throughout England, and in all cases resolutions were passed. The resolution at Hyde Park demanded immediate effective attention to the following means of dealing with some of the most pressing social problems : adequate housing and transport, amnesty to political and military prisoners, employment of all able-bodied adults on work useful to the community, the endowment.of motherhood, equal pay for men. and women, full maintenance for workers disabled in the war and their dependents,&quot; full compensation for all workers injured in industry, and support for widows and orphans and the infirm, the abolition of the Aliens&apos; Restriction Act, and the abolition of the present charitable system and the adoption of State support and control for the blind. Various political resolutions were also passed, and a demand was made for a drastic handling of high prices and full recognition of the industrial co-operative movement. Mi&apos;. J. H. Thomas, Mr. C. T. Cramp, Mr. F. Hodges, Mr. -1. Sexton and other important Labour leaders addressed meetings in the provinces. There was in no case any suggestion that the day should he celebrated by a strike, and there does not appear to havebeen any general stoppage of work except among miners. In a large number of cases workpeople abstained from work individually. In some cases it was arranged between employers and workpeople that the clay should be regarded as a holiday, and. co-operative societies in London appear to have given their employees a holiday.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.BRITISH EAST AFRICA.The Indian Community. ReuteFs Bombay agent telegraphed as follows on 3rd May:-Commenting upon a private telegram received in India from England stating that the situation of the Indians in East Africa is critical, and that the Colonial Office
is anxious to arrive at a decision before the matter is brought into full publicitj&apos;, the Bombay Chronicle urges an immediate and resolute expression of public opinion in India, including public meetings, and a deputation to proceed to London to plead India&apos;s cause, and so strengthen the hands of the India U Government,, and hearten their countrymen in East Africa.Quite recently a deputation of Indians representing the Indian community in British East Africa was received at the Colonial Office, and laid before the heads of the department a number of grievances, of which they demanded. redress. The last annual meeting of the Indian National Congress for British East Africa held in that protectorate passed some 30 resolutions asking for the removal of disabilities affecting Indians. Of these, the principal are the reservation of the high lands of the protectorate for non-Indian settlers ; the segregation of Indians for sanitary reasons in the towns ; and the recent admission of representatives of the European com-munity on an elective basis to the Administrative Council, a privilege which has not been extended to the Indian community. The whole matter of the statas of Indian settlers in British East Africa is now under the consideration of the Colonial Office.INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xvi., p. 2].- On 30th April the A&apos;iceroy telegraphed [522 S.] that Mr. Dobbs had reported that after Sir Abdul Qaiyum had announced the suspension of discussions, Mahmud Tarsi called upon - his colleague, Ghulam Muhammed, to give a plain-spoken statement of the objects which had brought the Afghan delegates to India. This he proceeded to do to the effect that the discussions were valueless. The true facts were that the Afghans could still come to terms with the Bolsheviks, but preferred to deal with Great Britain, partly&apos;because she was an old friend and partly because she was a well-established Power and. was wealthy. If it were made worth their while, the Afghans could easily shake off the Bolsheviks and keep the Indian seditionists in check. The question was how much Great Britain was prepared to give them. They desired to have Waziristan handed over to them because they could control the tribesmen, who otherwise would not cease to be a trouble on the frontier. In addition, the Afghans were being accused of deserting the tribesmen who had helped them in the war. That in a few words was their object, .and further conversations were unnecessary.In reply to his telegram to the Amir, Tarsi had received a telegram from him -denying all knowledge of the Chaman episode, and declaring that no advance of Afghan troops beyond their boundary had either been ordered or taken place. Nadir Khan had also telegraphed denying that any advance had taken place since the conclusion of peace in the Peiwar or in Ghitral, but asserting that the incidents complained of had taken place in localities which were in Afghan possession during the war. Accordingly, Tarsi had written to Mr. Dobbs that no advance had taken place, ,that the incidents complained of were only tribal outbreaks, and that nothing would be - done by Afghanistan to forfeit Great Britain&apos;s friendship. Mr. Dobbs pointed out in his report that by contending that they were entitled to re-occupy positions held by them during the war, the Afghans were ignoring the clause in the Rawalpindi Treaty which recognized the former frontiers. In the meantime, the Afghans had been making a further advance in Chitral. Mr. Dobbs had returned to Mussoorie to insist on the withdrawal of Afghan troops, and to inform Tarsi that -discussions could not be resumed until this was done, at the same time showing him the fallacy of the arguments by which the Afghans sought to justify their action.Should the Afghans comply, Mr. Dobbs was to counsel the discussion of all matters which were the subject of difference before breaking up the conference. If,, -on the other hand, Tarsi were to insist on compliance with the Afghan demands regarding Waziristan prior to the resumption of conversations, there would be an end to the proceedings, and the Afghan delegates would have to return to their-own -country. On the supposition that this difficulty might be overcome and discussions resumed, the Indian Government felt strongly that, in view of the fact that their hands had been more or less forced by the blunt statement of Afghan demands, they should have it in their power to make on their side some preliminary statement as to what they might be ready to offer as a basis of further negotiations for a treaty of
friendship. Without such a declaration the Indian Government anticipated the return of the Afghan delegates to Cabul in an unfriendly state of mind, which even if it were not productive of a declaration of war, would certainly result in a continual state of tension on the frontier which would.be extremely troublesome and almost as expensive as war, which in the long run it would be difficult to avoid. The Indian Government ashed, therefore, that the question of the title of &quot;His Majesty &quot; might be reconsidered as a possible concession; and, secondly, that they might/be authorized to announce to the Afghan delegates that, should the present conference result in negotiations for a treaty of friendship, they would be prepared to resume the subsidy formerly granted to Habibulla in return for neighbourly conduct and regard for British interests.Gh 4th May the Secretary of State for India replied [P. 3462] to the above,, regretting his inability to accept the view of the Indian Government. He deprecated the idea of letting the Afghans force our hands towards, a premature offer of concessions. As far as Afghan requirements went, any misunderstanding had been cleared away by their statement, and they had proved to be entirely unacceptable.. The actions of the Afghans on our frontier afforded no indication of any friendly feelings, a display of which was essential before entering into negotiations for a treaty of friendship. In these circumstances the Secretary of State was unable to grant the contingent authority on either of the heads proposed by the Indian Government. While not underrating the possible consequences of the return of the Afghan delegates in an unfriendly frame of mind, the Secretary of State did not believe either that the offer of concessions, which might be considered inadeqtrate, would necessarily avert those consequences, or that the offer of fresh concessions would lead to a satisfactory result, so long as Jthe Afghans maintained their present attitude. The Secretary of State was not prepared to go further than to authorize a hint that a subsidy would result onpy from the establishment of a genuine friendship and satisfactory conduct on the part of the Amir, and might be followed by the title of &quot; Plis Majesty.&quot;The Viceroy transmitted [534 S.J a telegram from Mr. Dobbs, dated 1st May, which was received here on 4th May. Mr. Dobbs relates a discussion which he had held with Tarsi and his colleague in which the same arguments were put forward on either side as were described in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 30th April. Mr. Dobbs declined to accede to the proposal that he should give a strong hint that we would go some way to meet Afghan wishes regarding the frontier tribes, with a view to a withdrawal being ordered by the Amir. He undertook, however; to give careful attention to the delegates&apos; arguments, if the conference were resumed.. Tarsi engaged to write to the Amir on the return of Abdtd Hadi, so Mr. Dobbs concludes that several days may elapse before it will be known whether conversations will, be resumed or not.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Report [B.E.R.. xvi., p. 4]. 1. The report,of Madras on the National week received since last week&apos;s telegram shows that but little enthusiasm was exhibited in Madras and practically none elsewhere in the presidency. The meetings, where held, were sparsely attended and only at one place was there Hartal and that was abortive. In Madras there were meetings on the 6th, 9th, and 13th, poorly attended and the speeches moderate in tone. Probably the lack of active interest during this period was due to Shaukat Ali and other Mohamedan leaders being expected in Madras on the 17th. The speech delivered by Shaukat Ali on the Caliphate question and non-co-operation, on the 17th, was misleading ancl disloyal but it is impossible at present to estimate its effect exactly as moderates were present at the meeting and the speech was delivered in the Urdu language, not understood probably by the majority of the audience. At present there is no reason to anticipate serious trouble in Madras on the announcement of the Turkish peace terms: The Mohamedans form a small minority and few are willing to commit themselves to violent action, and the Hindus Wpuld not support extreme action. There are but few Indian troops in the presidency ancl nothing has been heard of attempts to disseminate seditious literature among them. Agitators continue their attempts to undermine the loyalty of the police, using economic rather than political arguments.2. The report from the North-West Frontier shows that before 19th March the Caliphate agitation might have been dangerous, but the Hartal of the 19th passed off quietly and, after it, the popular excitement cooled. The rural population, practi-cally untouched by political propaganda, was anxious about the fate of Turkey, but was prepared to accept a reasonable measure of punishment.   But even the rural
population is liable to sudden gusts of excitement, and any ebullition in the Punjab or the chief towns of the North-West Frontier might react suddenly and seriously on it. Among the urban population there had been general excitement, but definite demonstrations at Peshawar only. Three meetings were held, but the audiences were small and also the, enthusiam. Along with the Caliphate, reforms such as the repeal of the Frontier Tribes Regulation were taken up. The organizers were men of little importance. At a meeting on the 13th .an undesirable Afghan, Haji Gholam Naqshband, suggested the emancipation of Mohamedans in our power by means of employing the help of the Amir of Afghanistan, and the meeting voted in support of this. He has been arrested and interned in the gaol at Abbotabad. His arrest was accepted quietly. The boycott has made no headway, and serious trouble is only expected on the announcement of the Turkish peace terms if there is trouble in the Punjab. No action beyond that already indicated, is required, as the real leaders are reasonable. There is no evidence of the dissemination of seditious literature among the troops. Attempts to tamper with the police are being made, but unostentatiously. We have addressed the Local Governments in the sense of our last weekly telegram, namely, asking them if they think action is necessary, to give us and the other provinces affected previous intimation. We have also informed them that we strongly support any action that can possibly be taken to prosecute persons proved to be attempting to disseminate seditious literature among the troops and the police, or to otherwise shake their loyalty.4. The situation in Delhi is deteriorating and causing anxiety to the authorities. We have authorized the Chief Commissioner to proclaim the area under the Seditious Meetings Act, and have suggested to him the desirability of prosecuting the violent speakers at the meetings of the 18th and 19th, as also the assailant of the Imands brother. The Chief Commissioner has also taken Rs. 2,000 security from the new paper Hurriyat, which outstepped the bounds of decency and published&apos;the Amir&apos;s speech on the anniversary of his fatheFs death.5. There is a growing cleavage of opinion among the promoters of the Caliphate agitation. Hindus are definitely not prepared to go to extreme lengths-even the Mohamedans are beginning to suspect Gandhi&apos;s motives in, identifying himself with the agitation and to feel that the protest is being overdone. Prominent Mohamedans of Dacca, at a meeting of the new Mohamedan Association, pointed out that the Hindus would at once replace Mohamedans who gave up the service and that the progressive boycott device had been invented by vakils whose pockets would not be affected. The extremists are, however, as active as ever outstanding recent speeches being those at Delhi, that of Shaukat Ali at Madras already quoted, and of Lajpat Raj at Allahabad, and the danger from such speeches is considerable. The latter urged a change in the psychology of Indians and the abandonment of the belief in the necessity of foreign rule to bring about their amelioration.Interest in the Caliphate was incumbent on Indians, not only out of respect for the feelings of Mohamedans, but because the independence of Asia is threatened if Turkey is dismembered. The situation is complicated by the presence of the Afghan delegation at Mussoorie -which professes much interest in Turkey and sympathizes with the Caliphate movement. This has induced a number of extremists to address communications to and visit the delegates. The speech of Tarsi in the mosque at Dehra has been upheld in many papers and a copy of the amir&apos;s speech on the anniversary of his father&apos;s death has been sent to the delegation and reproduced in the papers ; the effect of the presence of the delegates is seriously to encourage unrest amongst the extremists.6. Sporadic cases of labour unrest continue, but prices show a tendency to fall. Small strikes are reported from Madras.THE DOMINIONS.Imperial Conference. The following is a summary of a telegraphic corre-spondence which has taken place between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Dominions, on the subject of holding an Imperial Conference in the year 1920. The question was raised on 4th March by General Smuts, who considered that the subject of the new status of the Dominions and a definite settlement of the constitutional relations in the Empire were matters for consideration at an early date. 16-2 B
On 27th March the Secretary of State replied that he had consulted the Prime Minister, and both felt considerable doubt whether the special Constitutional Conference contemplated in Resolution IX. of the Imperial Conference of 1917, could be. held with any advantage before the next year, i.e,, 1921. At the same time, it was felt that there were many matters of Imperial -consequence which made it very desirable that the Prime Ministers of the Empire should meet in the course of the present year, in accordance with the conclusions arrived at in 1917, as to the desirability of an annual meeting of the Imperial Conference and Cabinet. -The Secretary of State then informed the Government of South Africa of a suggestion received from the Canadian Government that it might be convenient to hold a meeting of the Imperial Conference at Ottawa in October next. The Prime Minister had. signified his -willing assent to the suggestion, if circumstances made it practical and. convenient for the Prime Ministers of the Dominions&apos; as well as for himself to be present. The Prime Minister desired to know the views of the Governments of the s   Empire, and had cabled a similar communication to New Zealand and Australia.The following gives the substance of the replies received : New Zealand.On 31st March a message from the Prime Minister of New Zealand stated that while he saw no objection to the next Imperial Cabinet or Conference being held in Ottawa, there were reasons for Ins own inability to attend, and lie was of opinion that the proposed Conference should be postponed until the following year if possible.South Africa.The Prime Minister of South Africa in his answer dated 3rd April said that he did not see what purpose would be served by holding the annual meeting of the Prime Ministers away from London, and foresaw difficulties if it were held at Ottawa. He pointed out that a meeting in London afforded opportunity to the Dominions representatives to transact much business. He named the end of September as a suitable time for himself to come to London.Australia.In his message dated 14th April the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth expressed his surprise at the suggestion that the meeting of Prime Ministers should be held at Ottawa this year, in the face of the clear understanding that it was to be held in London next year. Existing arrangements would preclude his absence from Australia, and Mr. Hughes hoped it would be possible to arrange for the Imperial Cabinet to meet next year in London.In view of these replies the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to Canada on 2Sth April that the replies received showed that other Prime Ministers saw insuperable difficulties in holding any meeting this year, and that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia was most anxious that the meeting of the Imperial Cabinet should take place in London next year.On the other hand, there appeared to be general agreement as&apos; to the desirability of holding the special Constitutional Conference, under Resolution IX. of the Imperial War Conference, 1917, next year.In the circumstances it seemed clear (1) that no meeting of the Imperial Cabinet could be held this year ; (2) that the meeting of the Imperial Cabinet, and also the special Constitutional Conference, should take place next year if possible.While the places of both meetings must remain undecided for the present, His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped that the Government of Canada would keep open the invitation to Ottawa.On the same date, 28th April, the Secretary of State sent the following telegram to the Governors-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa:  The following for your Prime Minister, with reference to my telegram of 27th March. From replies received it is clear that the difficulties in the way of holding a plenary session of the Imperial Cabinet this year are insuperable, and I have informed the Canadian Government accordingly.As regards arrangements for next year, and in particular as to the date and place of meeting of the special Constitutional Conference contemplated under Resolution IX. of the Imperial War Conference, 1917,1 will communicate with you later on.
Proposed British Empire Exhibition.--- On 5th May the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Officer Administering the Government of Canada, the Governors General of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and the Governor of NewfoundlandHis Majesty&apos;s Government propose to ask Parliament for authority to guarantee the promoters of the British Empire Exhibition proposed to be held in London, against loss to the extent of 100,0001., on condition that guarantees from other sources are obtained of not less than 500,000L The general committee, of which His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has accepted the presidency, at the invitation of If is Majesty&apos;s Government, desire to obtain guarantees of at least 1,000,OOOZ. His Majesty the King has graciously given his patronage to the exhibition, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have appointed an official representative to the executive committee-wlrich is being formed. An appeal will be circulated for subscriptions to the guarantee fund, and, at the request of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the Lord Mayor of London will hold a public meeting in support of the project towards the end of this month. The High Commissioners for the Dominions and the Agents-General for the Australian States have been invited to attend. It is unlikely that it will be possible to organize the exhibition on the scale contemplated before 1923. It is hoped that steps will be taken to ensure an adequate partici-pation in the exhibition of all parts of the Empire. Information as to the scope of the exhibition, buildings available, and the general regulations will be furnished as soon as the arrangements are further advanced..    CANADA.Greenland. On 3rd May the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Officer Administering the Government that it was thought by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it would be desirable to inform beforehand the French, Italian aud Lhiitecl States Governments of the condition we intended to attach to the British recognition of Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The Italian Ambassador had, in fact, enquired as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the Danish request. Having thus warned these Governments, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposed to inform tire Danish Minister that the geographical position of Greenland made the question of its territoriai ownership a matter of great importance to the British Empire as a whole, and to Canada in particular; but that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have no objection to recognizing Danish sovereignty over the whole of Greenland provided that in the event of Denmark wishing to dispose of the territory she was prepared to grant the right of pre-emption to the British Empire. Lord Milner added that he should be glad to have as soon as possible the views of the Canadian Ministers on this proposal.In reply to this, the Officer Administering the Government telegraphed to the Secretary of State on 6th May, saying that the course of action proposed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs met with the concurrence of the Canadian Government.Representation at Washington [B.E.R., xiii., pi 6]. On 5th May the Officer Administering the Government reported that his Government had been informed by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington that he had been verbally notified by the United States Secretary of State that the United States Government could see nothing but approval of the proposal for the representation of Canadian interests at AVashington.International Financial Conference [B.E.R., xvi.; p. 7]. On 26th April the Officer Administering the Government telegraphed to *the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : My Ministers are glad to have information concerning the International Financial Conference, but they point out that so far the Government of Canada has received no direct invitation from the Secretary-General of the League -of Nations. In respect of other matters the Secretary-General has adopted the practice of addressing communications direct to the Prime Minister of Canada, and my Ministers consider it desirable that this method should be followed. Incases where telegraphic communication is necessary they think it more appropriate and convenient to use the machinery of the High Commissioner^ -office and they are instructing the High Commissioner to this effect. 16-2 O
To this Lord Milner replied on 30th April saying that the formal invitation from the League Secretariat was addressed direct to the Canadian Government and had been sent by bag on 21st April as usual, under cover addressed to. the Canadian Prime Minister. The information was sent by telegram for the convenience of the Canadian Government at the request of the League Secretariat. He added that the wishes of the Dominion Government had been noted as regards future procedure.Peace Treaty Reservations. On 30th April the Officer Administering the Govern-ment of Canada telegraphed as follows :-The Canadian Government note with satisfaction that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to make clear to the United States Government that they cannot accept, the reservations and the resolving clause if and when adopted by the Senate. The Canadian Government did not contemplate any public declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but rather that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington should, make the position of the Canadian Government clear in the proper quarter there. In view of the course of events neither a public declaration nor any further representation at Washington is at present necessary. However, if at a later date the matter should again come before the United States Senate, my Ministers feel that it would lie desirable that their position should be formally made known to the United States Government in advance of final action by the Senate, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding. Should the Canadian representative at Washington be appointed before further action becomes necessary, the matter could be taken up by him.AUSTRALIA.Enemy Debts ami Mandated Territories [B.E.R., xv., p. 6]. On 6th. May the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governor-General that further representations&apos; had been received from the Government of Germany, of which what follows was the substance : -The demand that the clearing office system should apply as between Germany and mandated territories finds no support in the terms of the Treaty of Peace. The territories to which the system refers are enumerated individually in Article 296e, under which it extends not only to the motherlands of the Allied and Associated Powers, but also to their colonies and protectorates as well as to the British Dominions ancl India. Mandated territories are not mentioned ; therefore the Article does not apply to them. This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that in Article 121 the terms of sections 1 and 4 of part 10 are stated to apply to German Colonies, but not the regulations in section 3; - whereas in other cases, e.g., Morocco (Article .144) and Egypt (Article 153), section 3 is explicitly stated to apply. Accordingly the Government of Germany cannot recognize the applicability of the system to mandated territories.Lord Milner added that in view of these representations it did not seem possible to proceed with, the scheme without obtaining a ruling from the Mixed Arbitral Tribunal, and in the circumstances he hoped that the Commonwealth Ministers would withdraw their objections to this course, in which the Government of New Zealand had already concurred.Question of Trading with certain Territories formerly Austro-Hungarian [B.E.R., xvi., p. 10].-The Governor-General informed the Secretary of-State on 28th April that the Italian Ambassador might be informed that the Government of the Commonwealth would permit resumption of trade with those parts of the late monarchy of Austria-Hungary which had been ceded to Italy by Article 36 of the-. Treaty of Peace of .10th September last.NEW ZEALAND.Meat. On 5th May the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, saying that he should be glad to receive an early reply to his telegram of 10th March in regard to the frozen meat trade [B.E.R;, xiii., p. 8]. Producers were seriously concerned with regard to the outlook for frozen meat and wool, ancl in order that his Ministers might be in a proper position to place the whole facts before them, it was essential that the information desired with regard to the Imperial Government requisition of insulated shipping should be available at the earliest possible date.
SOUTH AFRICA,Political Situation. The Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State -on 27th April, reporting that an acute political crisis had suddenly arisen. The Profiteering Bill was before the House, and the Labour Party had moved that the order for its second reading should be discharged and the subject matter he referred to a select Committee with an instruction to make provision practically for nationalizing -and municipalizing the production and distribution of the necessaries of life. The Nationalists had moved an amendment to this which accepted the words down to &quot; select Committee &quot; but proposed to omit the remainder of the amendment. A division would be taken on the first part.The day before General Smuts had stated in a speech that he would stand or fall by die motion for the second reading. Mr. Creswell, who followed, declared that the Labour Party must persist in their amendment. Unless they thought better of the position and abstained, Labour must vote with the Nationalists on the first part of the amendment.   The result of the division was very uncertain.Telegraphing again on 30th April, Lord Buxton said that at the last moment the Labour Party had asked leave to withdraw their amendment. This was objected to by the Nationalists and on the division for the second reading the Labour members as -a body abstained from voting. The majority for the second reading was 83 against 40, the latter being all Nationalists. The Government would, therefore, have had a majority anyhow.   The position of the Government had been greatly strengthened.Proposed re-establishment of German Consulates. On 30th April the Governor-General reported that his Ministers had no objection to the re-establishment of German consulates in South Africa provided they were consulted before any individual was accepted for appointment.The &quot;Budget-On 3rd May Lord Buxton informed the Secretary of State as follows in regard to the new budget which was introduced on 30th April: The revised estimates for 1919-20 anticipate a surplus of 2,271,000Z., which will be applied to the redemption of debt. The estimates for 1920-21, after allowing for the expenditure this year of 3,500,OOOZ. odd, leave a surplus of 88,O00Z. Taxation is remitted to the amount of 525,0001. The additional revenue from the increase in postal tariffs, &amp;c, is estimated at 4.00,000L This leaves a final estimated deficit of 37,000Z. The following are the chief alterations : (u) On inland and Empire letters -and letter cards the postage is increased from one penny a half ounce to three-halfpence an ounce; on postcards a minimum charge of one penny; whilst telegrams are increased from Is. to Is. 3d. -for twelve words, (b) The income tax allowance for children to be increased from SOI. to 50Z., and applied to incomes up to 1,000Z. instead of OOOZ. ,(c) Suspension of the duty on grain and flour with a loss of 100,()0OZ.(d) Remission of the 5 per cent, war duty in Customs duties on wearing apparel, cotton and woollen goods&apos; in piece, cotton and woollen  blankets, and hosiery.(e) Termination of the excess profits duty. (/) The war levy on gold mines expires -during the year.International Financial Conference. The Governor-General telegraphed to the -Secretary of State on the 8th May saying that his Ministers regretted that they were unable to accept the invitation of the Council of the League of Nations to send delegates to the International Financial Conference. A reply to the questionnaire would be furnished to the Secretary-General as soon as possible.Votes for Women. ReuteFs Capetown agent reported on 3rd May that the Union House of Assembly had that day adopted by 64 votes to 39 a motion in favour -of the extension of the parliamentary franchise to women.Problem of Low-Grade Mines. The following message was sent from Johannesburg on 4th May by ReuteFs agent: An important meeting has been held here of representatives from the Mine Workers&apos; Union and the Chamber of Mines, for the purpose of discussing a rearrangement of underground work, as mentioned in the report of the Low-Grade Mines Commission. The position of the low-grade mines, was put before the men&apos;s leaders, and it is believed their co-operation was invited towards the solution of the problem for the cutting down of staffs in mines that have
to be closed down, so that any change may affect the fewest possible men. It is announced that the Princess Estate and Gold Mining Company is closing clown as the&quot; ore is worked out. One hundred and eighty employees will be gradually dispensed, with, but efforts are being made to absorb them elsewhere.Wheat Shortage. Reuter&apos;s. Capetown agent reported on 4th May that in the Union House of Assembly Sir Thomas Smartt had raised the question of the serious wheat shortage which had been accompanied by a recent jump in prices: In reply, Mr. Burton, Minister of Finance, deprecated panic. The Government, he said, was. endeavouring to induce the Australian Government to remove the embargo on the export of wheat. Notwithstanding the fastidiousnessof South Africans in demanding the finest wheaten bread, it might be necessary to revert to the war time measure of enforcing the use of wdiolemeal flour or an admixture of wheat and other grains, especially maize, of which the supply was ample.
