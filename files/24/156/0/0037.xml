GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the reports of the Ministry of Labour for the weeks ending 5th and 12th February : General Survey of the Week ending bth February. The most important labour event of the week was the special trades union and labour conference on the 27th January, to consider the report of the joint committee on unemployment, appointed by the parliamentary committee of the trades union congress and the Labour party executive, on the 11th January. The conference may be said to. have proceeded &quot;according to plan.&quot; The resolutions were passed unanimously, after comparatively little discussion ; and the conference then adjourned until the 23rd February, to enable the executives of the trade unions to ascertain, in the meantime, the views of the rank and file on the steps to be taken to secure the adoption of the cdmmittee&apos;s recommendations. The speeches made at the conference were, generally speaking, moderate and restrained ; but the opinion is widely held that some kind of action may be taken when the adjourned conference meets again. Certain unions are aiready reported to be arranging for a ballot of their members on the question of the adoption of a &quot; down tools &quot; policy, in the event of the Government refusing to accede to the demands of the conference.....The representatives of the international shipping federation and the1 international seamen&apos;s federation concluded, on the 26th January, their conference at Brussels on the question of hours of labour on board ship. It was decided to entrust the examination of the technical details to two commissions, one of which wall deal with the deck and engine-room staffs, and the other with the general service staffs. These commissions will meet within 30 days and prepare a report, which will be submitted to a new conference, to be convened by the director of the international labour office. The conference just concluded is of special interest in view of the fact that it is the first example of two international organizations, representing employers ancl employed in a particular industry, meeting with a view to arriving at am agreement on conditions of work.General Survey of the Week ending 12th February. The unemployment position does not improve, ancl continues to dominate the general industrial situation, which remains quiet. The position of those unemployed persons who will shortly have exhausted their right to benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, and of those ex-service men ancl women who are in a similar position as regards out-of-work donation, is causing anxiety. In preparation for the adjourned joint Labour conference on unemployment, which is to meet on the 23rd February, trade unions and local Labour parties are taking steps to consider their policy with regard to the report of the special joint sub-committee which. was adopted by the conference. A joint conference of the London trades council ancl the London Labour party will be held on the 19th February to consider the proposed Labour policy.Unemployment. The position with regard, to unemployment remains about the same. The terms of reference of the unemployment grants committee under the chairmanship of Lord St. Davids have now been extended in three directions. The committee are enabled to make grants in respect of the maintenance and construction of roads other than roads coming within the scheme of the Ministry of Transport, notwithstanding that the expenditure on labour may be less than 50 per cent, of the total; they may make grants not exceeding 60 per cent, of the wages bill for additional men engaged ; ancl grants are now permitted to be made through local authorities to a distress committee or voluntary agency, provided that the scheme, in respect of which a grant is given, has been definitely recommended by the local authority, anil that the authority make themselves responsible for the observance of the conditions laid down by the committee. It is reported that about 250,000?.. has been expended out of the fund of 3,000,000Z. allocated to the committee, and employment provided for- about 7,700 men. The number of schemes in respect of which grants have been made is about 150, and include schemes for road making and repairing, for the laying of -water and gas pipes, the extension ancl repair of cemeteries, and other undertakings.   A certain number of applications for grants
have had to be refused, either because the Ministry of Labour have been unable to certify, that serious unemployment exists in the district concerned, or because the works were begun or concluded before the date on which the committee was constituted. Every effort is being made to expedite the bestowal of grants, -applications being dealt with as soon as they are received.   [1.2th February.!  &quot;COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c., EGYPT.&quot;Nationalist Split. Mr. Scott reported [No. 86] from Cairo on 9th February that the live returned emissaries were stated, on good authority, to be spreading the idea that the usefulness of Zagloul Pasha had come to an end, the value of his services to Egypt being at the same time fully recognized. They also professed that their reason for wishing to disguise the split was the fear that in view of the disunion less liberal terms might be offered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.PALESTINE.Trans-Jordania. Telegraphing [No. 45] from Jerusalem on 1st February, Sir Herbert Samuel said that he was then in a position to review the existing situation in Trans-Jordania. There had been no interruption either in the preparations for an attack on the French or in the sherinaii propaganda : and our inactivity was causing doubt as to our intentions in regard to the future of the country. The enthusiasm displayed by the local population six months ago had been considerably modified. Meanwhile the collection of taxes and the maintenance of authority had become an increasingly difficult problem for the local Governments.Telegraphing [No. 57] again on 10th February, he said that the British representatives at Adjlun, Salt, and Amman found that the influence of the sherifians was on the increase and their own steadily decreasing, which had an adverse effect on the local authorities. On 29th January a small party set out from Amman iii a northerly direction, their object being to destroy the railway north of Deraa: the party was accompanied by two sherifian officers.INDIA., . Mission to Kabul [B.E.U., xxxvi, p. 5]. On 31st January the Viceroy transmitted [136 S] the contents of a telegram received from Sir Henry Dobbs, dated 30th January, in which he reported an interview between Nawab and Tarsi at the end of which Nadir Khan intervened. As regarded clause 8, Tarsi appeared to be upset at the prospect of a collapse of the negotiations, but Nadir Khan maintained the position of non-retraction, even if Tarsi agreed to a treaty on the lines of the Mussoorie conference. All depended, therefore, on which side the Amir should throw his weight, and Sir Henry expressed little, hope of the negotiations being continued. Both Nadir Khan and the Minister of Commerce stated that in the event of negotiations breaking down, there need be no alteration in existing relations, as since the treaty of Rawal Pindi, both sides had got on very well without a treaty of friendship. Sir Henry proposed to refute this statement, and to call attention to the forbearance which had been exhibited in regard to numerous incidents, only in the hope that Afghanistan would realize the value of our friendship. In future, however, we should unhesitatingly take any measures deemed necessary for the maintenance of our security and honour.In a further telegram of 3rd February the Viceroy transmitted Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; account of a private party to which he had been invited by Tarsi to meet Jamah at which the latter enlarged on the Turkish policy and attitude during the war, and did not conceal his bitterness against the Allies.   Sir Henry declined to accede to Tarsfs
Tequest for a private interview on the question of the tribes, saying he would await the Afghan decision and statement to be made at an official meeting.The results of the fourth meeting of the Mission with the Afghans on 2nd February were reported to the Viceroy and transmitted [170 S.] by him: on 5th February. Sir Henry Dobbs had presented a complete review of the Afghan demands regarding our tribes, ancl had demonstrated the breach of faith which they involved. In reply to Nadir Khan?s-requirement that our policy of road making and of stationing troops in Waziristan and in independent tribal territories should be reversed, and amnesty given to the Waziris, Mahsuds and Afridis for past offences, Sir Henry said that this was impossible. In view of the improbability of the Afghans receding from their position, Sir Beriry anticipated that proceedings would be broken off in four or live days&apos; time, and requested that arrangements should, be made for the necessary transport for return.Telegraphing [182 S.J on 9th February, the Viceroy repeated a message from Sir Henry Dobbs, dated 7th February, in which he reported the receipt of a somewhat acrimonious note from Tarsi. The latter denied any breach of faith, insisted again on the right of the tribes to self-determination, ancl dwelt on the justice of clause 8, declaring at the same time that the Afghans had no desire to set aside the British offer of friendship. He further invited Sir Henry to put forward a draft of his own. Sir Henry took this to indicate an inclination to recede from the position provided Afghanistan could save her face. Having accepted. Tarsi&apos;s invitation to have a private meeting with him, Sir Henry submitted the draft of the clause which he proposed to put forward in substitution for clause S, ancl asked for the approval, or otherwise, of the Indian Government, In the meantime he intended to inform Tarsi that the suggested clause had not yet been approved by his Government.The Viceroy telegraphed [18G S.] on 10th February the views of the Indian Govern-ment on the situation. It seemed clear to them that unless the Afghan Government were assisted to climb down from the impossible position they had assumed towards the frontier tribes, a collapse of the negotiations could not be avoided. It was thought that the formula drafted by Sir Henry Dobbs was the best that could be devised to meet the case with any prospect of success. In view of the grave consequences which might follow on a breakdown of the negotiations, it was urged that, subject to certain modifications, Sir Henry Dobbs should be authorized to adopt his draft as a basis for further proceedings.   The approval of the Secretary of State was sought,On 11 tli February the Secretary of State telegraphed [923] to the Viceroy in acknowledgment of the foregoing.&apos;; Pie agreed that negotiations should not be allowed to break down if a minor concession to save the face of Afghanistan in the matter of the tribes would prevent it. He pointed out, however, that Sir Henry Dobbs&apos;draft left other highly contentious clauses still to be considered, ancl wished to be more assured of the prospect of a general settlement, before we were committed to offers which, in the event of failure to come to an agreement, would be inevitably quoted against us. The Secretary of State then gave an expression of his views, of which he was anxious that the Viceroy and Sir Henry Dobbs should be fully apprised. With the hope that means might be found to give effect to them, although he did not wish his objections pressed to the breaking point, he left matters to the Viceroy&apos;s discretion.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Rqwrl. The following report was sent by the Viceroy on 8th February : -I. (8th February). Bengal. The functions in connexion with the Duke&apos;s visit passed off successfully. The influence of the visit on the public mind was undoubtedly reduced by the presence of the non-co-operative leaders. The absence of spectators was marked on all occasions, except the public arrival, when there was a1 fair turn-out. The visit provided a dignified and seemly send-off for the Council and served as a rallying point for the more stable, element.Section 2. Taxicab drivers resumed work on 24th January on the grant of certain concessions pending the report of the committee. On 26th January, the tramway employees struck &quot;work ancl are still out. The strike amongst the student class has spread widely throughMofiissil. Gandhi addressed a letter to the Duke of Connaught in which he emphasizes that non-co-operation is not at war with individual Englishmen, ancl seeks to destroy not English life, but the system which has emasculated the country in body ancl mind and soul.   After referring to 0&apos;Dwyerism
0aud Dyerism in die Punjab, and the wanton affront to Islamic (sic), lie claims that non-co-pperation is a religious purifying movement. Das has issued an appeal to the students, urging them to come out of the colleges and to wake up in the&apos;cause of freedom. The Madras congress delegates, on their return from Nagpur, made great-efforts to arrange to boycBtt the Duke&apos;s visit. A. meeting was held on the 9th, the day before his Royal Higbness&apos;s arrival, and a procession went through the streets carrying banners and inciting the people to boycott; the language was extreme and the behaviour of the crowds somewhat truculent; there was no serious breach of the peace. A similar meeting was arranged for the next day, in the hope thai it would draw people away from the line of route ; this was a complete failure, the attendance was not more than 200. In the. evening, after his Royal Highness bad passed, a considerable number of people went to the boycott meeting, and in all some 8,000 or 10,000 may have been present. They wore to a large extent merely casual spectators, who completed a day&apos;s amusement by a visit to rival entertainments. As a serious demonstration, it was &quot;wholly ineffective. An attempt was also made to organize a general strike among the public utility services in the city; to persuade postmen, scavengers, water and electric light workers to strike. A strike actually occurred only among the tramway men. The mass of the people paid no attention whatever to the various suggestions to boycott, and gave his Royal Highness a hearty welcome whenever he appeared in public, and after the ,failure of the attempt on this day the non-co-operationists made no further efforts. 1.he situation at the Buckingham mills is not free from anxiety: the strike continues&apos;, and the men will not abate their demands. The management is equally determined not to recognize the union, as at present constituted, and elaborate picketing prevents the men from coming in. A press message states that 14 pleaders have suspended practice in Gantur.Section 3. Central Provinces. Active agitation in support of non-co-operation is gaining strength ; principally directed to the boycott of colleges and schools, to-which the action of the Calcutta students gave further strength. The movement has spread at Jnbbulpore, and a disquieting feature is the attempt to undermine the&apos; teachers. National schools are being established iu several places, and in Nagpur a number of students in the national schools is said to have risen to 450. One member of the Legislative Council has resigned, and one title holder has surrendered his title. Pressure is beiug exercised on members of tbe Council, aud title holders, and social boycott is, in some cases, being practised. There is considerable feeling regarding cow-killing, particularly in northern districts, and some municipal committees are endeavouring to suppress all cow-slaughter in the municipal slaughter-houses. The first meeting of the Legislative Council was a distinct success ; a slightly jarring note was struck in connexion with the l)uke&apos;s visit, but otherwise the proceedings passed off harmoniously, and the standard of speaking was higher than in the last Council. The election of a few unsuitable members is not likely to impair the usefulness of the Council, which contains a number of men of character working for the success of the reforms in government.Punjab. The extremists are improving their organizations and disseminating&apos; political ideas among the rural classes ; a committee, with Lajpat Rai as president, . having been formed to carry on propagandist aud other work. Propaganda agents are active in the Jullundur district delivering seditions speeches, particularly in the-recruiting area. In view of the excitement caused, the local Government, considered it advisable to declare the Jullundur district a proclaimed area under the Seditious Meetings Act. The movement to take forcible possession of the Sikh shrines is gaining strength, and we have called for a full report from the local Government as to its extent and the measures proposed to deal with it. Lajpat Hai has started a second campaign for an educational boycott. He held, a meeting on 25th January at Gujranwala attended by many hundreds of students from Lahore, who returned in a limb, state of excitement. The movement has. had considerable success. A large anti-cow-killing conference held in Ivarnal was attended by about 15,000 persons. Delhi Mohamedan and Hindu leaders have enjoined that Mohamedans should reduce the number of cattle killed. The grounds for dissatisfaction among the peasantry are stated by an officer of experience to be (1) corruption of officials; i2) promises, real or alleged, made-by officials and non-officials to men who had helped during the war, which cannot now be redeemed; (3) the compulsory return to the villages of disbanded soldiers anxious to continue serving. We regard the position in the Punjab as having dangerous potentialities, particularly among the Sikhs in which community there is great unrest,
Delhi.-Political activity is at a discount. , There is no enthusiasm&apos; among the merchants and tradespeople for the hartals projected by the local congress com-mittee for 9th and 14th February, but some demonstrations of this nature are expected. Gandhi arrives on 13th February to open Ajmal Jvliahs Yunani and Ayurvedic Tibbia college. A fracas took place on. 28th January at the tomb in front of the Junta masjid between a number of frontier and trans-border Talib-ul-Ilms and some local Ghairmukallid Moslems. In the heat of religious argument one of the latter ran amok with a large knife. Four men were killed or died almost immediately from wounds, and live others are lying wounded in hospital. The murderer and his three companions have been arrested. The incident was purely an outburst of fanaticism with no political significance.        -Burma. The school boycott situation is unchanged. Mating Mating Sin, Burma representative in the Council of State, returned to Burma when on his way to Delhi. Pie was exposed, both in Mandalay and on the journey to Rangoon, to every kind of persecution and annoyance, and returned from Calcutta on account of fear of the social boycott of his family. The social boycott is likely to be used with more frequency and. with success in Burma. Boycott of foreign goods is oh the increase in Rangoon. Mandalay reports that a marked growth of anti-British feeling and anti-Government feeling is on the increase in the large towns, but the province as a whole is not yet noticeably affected.Section 4.   Assam. A student strike has occurred in the Gauhati and Sylhet colleges and in a few schools.Section 5. United Provinces. The local Government has decided that district magistrates shall prohibit meetings under section .1.44 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the Ondh districts of Fyzabad, Sultanpur, Rai Bareli, Barabanki, and Partabgarh, also on a prosecution of three prominent local agitators for seditious speaking at Sultanpur and Barabanki, and of a fourth person, a Sadhu, for attempting to seduce the police at Sultanpur. &apos;Reports show that the Deoband students have formed a society whose members will work as religions missionaries, the objects being (1) the propagation of true Islamic doctrines by preaching and practice; (2) the establishment of branches all over India; (3) the, furtherance of the caliphate (? cause), the missionaries undertaking to establish caliphate committees where they do not exist.Bihar and Orissa. Political excitement caused by the non-co-operation agitation continues. The situation at Mazaffarpur is easier, and hat [sic] looting has not been resumed. Vigorous efforts are being made to bring out the students, but with little success up to the present.   The industrial areas are quieter.Bombay. An intensive propaganda among students coupled with the results received in Bengal has had appreciable results in Bombay, Poona, and. the Koukan. A few hundred students in the Konkan and about 700. from most of the principal colleges in Bombay have registered their willingness to non-co-operation, and it is difficult to, say whether this is a mere ebullition of feeling which will not materialize. The labour situation is unstable.. General.-There are signs that non-co-operators are endeavouring to force the &apos; pace, which will be greatly accelerated if a large number of students can be secured for propaganda work amongst the masses, ft is probable that there wdll be a renewed attack on the colleges and schools, since the JSlagpur congress was largely inspired by a desire to obtain in this way an adequate supply of agents. It remains to be seen how far they wall be successful in this object, but there is a probability that the movement will culminate in sporadic, if not widespread, disturbances. Our aim is, by giving the fullest effect to the views of the legislature, and thus establishing the reality of the reforms, to enlist the support of moderate and sensible opinion. This will be valuable in dealing with disturbances should such occur, but the masses cannot be directly reached in this way, nor is there any reason to believe that the adoption of this policy -will influence the extremist campaign.
THE DOMINIONS.Conference on Electrical Communications [B.E.I!., xxxvi, p. 11]. On 10th February the following answer was sent by the Governor-General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in reply to the latter&apos;s telegram of 21st January : My Ministers-request that the matter of reservation of wave lengths greater than 5,000 metres for the use of Canadian stations maybe placed in the hands of the British commissioners. The Government of Canada will not send a representative to the meeting of the commission as the requirements of Canada were fully discussed with the British representatives at the preliminary electrical communication con-terence at Washington last November. These requirements are as follows: The Canadian Marconi Company requests the reservation of the Glacebay Trans-Atlantic service commission 7,500 metres, reception 6,000 metres; the Newcastle New Brunswick Trans-Atlantic service tranmission 8,000 metres, reception to be allocated by the commission; Montreal to Vancouver Trans-Canada service projected block between 10,000 and 12,000 metres; Vancouver to Australia and Japan Trans-Pacific service projected block between 13,001) and 16,000 metres. The Government of Canada requirements for the Government-operated stations in the imperial chain are one Trans-Atlantic projected on east coast, and one Trans-Pacific projected on the Pacific-coast, wave lengths for these stations to be as allocated by the commission.Eortlicom.in.fi Meeting of the Imperial Cabinet [13.E.lb, xxxiv, p. 7], On 25th January the following telegram from Mr. Lloyd George was sent to the Prime Minister of New Zealand : 1 trust earnestly that it will be possible for you to come to England for the conference next June. I consider that questions of vital importance to the future of the Empire will have to be discussed and decided tat the conference, especially its policy in regard to defence, the Pacific, the United States and the Anglo-Japanese alliance. I feel it would be a great calamity if we were deprived of your advice and experience.To this the Prime Minister of New Zealand replied as follows: My colleagues and I feel, in view of the nature of your telegram, that I ought to attend the conference of Prime Ministers in London next June. Unfortunately the industrial situation presents great difficulties, but 1 hope to be present at the conference unless a serious upheaval intervenes.CANADA.Miscellaneous. The following items of information have been communicated by the Department of External Affairs :  (1) Mr. Oborne Cott, general passenger agent at Vancouver of the Canadian National Railways, says : &quot; There is a big time coming in the west this spring. The rush to the oil fields on the Mackenzie River will be one of the landmarks in Canadian mining history. The Mackenzie will probably do for Edmonton what J &apos;awson and the Yukon did for Seattle.&quot; Those desiring to enter the Mackenzie River region this year must get clearance papers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. No flying-machine of any type will be permitted to leave for the north without being passed by the police, and without each passenger being certified by a medical officer as physically and mentally fit for the trip.(2) Canada&apos;s total trade with the West Indies during 1920 was 35 per cent, greater than that for 1919, its value being reckoned at approximately 129,750,000. The trade with Cuba increased by 225 per cent, during the year, amounting to $40,750,000, as compared with $18,200,000, the increase being due to heavy imports and the high price of sugar.(3) Business conditions in Canada are making a steady.but slow recovery, the sentiment of the business community being strikingly confident.(4) During 1920 some 75,800 immigrants entered Canada from the United Kingdom, 48,860 from the United States, and 22,700 from other countries. The increase in the number of arrivals from Great Britain was 50 per cent. In. 1919 the total immigration was 1.17,500.AUSTRALIA.    &apos;Air Pilots for Japan. On 11th February the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies saying that he understood that negotiations25-3 C
were proceeding between the Japanese Embassy in London and. the British Air Ministry with a view to the transfer to Japan of a number of experienced pilots as army and navy instructors, also that 16 pilots had been asked for and that some of them would be transferred during March. If the above were true the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be glad if arrangements could be made for the inclusion, of two or more Australian aviators in the party with a view to their gaining additional aeronautical experience. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would send only good men, and their experience should be of utmost value to Australia and the Empire in the. future.south Africa.The Elections. Telegraphing when the only result awaited was that of Waterburg, Reuter&apos;s agent at Cape Town sent the following :-General Smuts has secured a majority of 22 over all other parties,, no matter what the result of the ties may be, and not including Independents.How badly the Republicans have been smashed is seen by the following comparisons: South African Party.   Nationalists.Cape - 36 13Transvaal   - &apos;      -        -        -        -  28 13.&apos; Natal -.&apos;   &apos;  -,        ...        .   14 \The Orange Free State is the only province which shows a majority in favour of secession. In this&quot; province the Nationalists have secured 16 seats and the Labour party 1.According to the votes of the whole Union over 62 per cent, of the electors have voted against secession. The result of the election confirms the fact that the greatest feature of it has been the vast number of working men who have supported General Smuts&apos; policy of a non-racial South Africa under the Union Constitution. It is beyond doubt that the railwaymen&apos;s votes have greatly helped to give General Smuts his overwhelming majority.The state of parties now is : Seats. Gains.South African party - - - 78 19Labour                - - . - - 9 3Nationalists           - - - - 4-3 7Independents        - - - - 1American Press Comment on the Election Results. -ReutePs agent telegraphed as follows from New York on 11th February : due result of the South African elections has aroused much interest amongst the thinking classes in America. In some circles General Smuts&apos; victory came as a surprise, to such an extent has the American public since the war been served by interested sources with news, stories, interviews and reports tending to prove that the British Empire is in immediate danger of breaking up as the result of the alleged -desire of the Dominions to become independent of the mother country.The Wall Street Journal this morning urges its readers to &quot; study the lesson to be drawn from the result of these elections, especially at the present time when Great Britain is being rapidly baited in this country,&quot; and emphasizes that it is &quot;important to remember that the ties binding the British Empire are far stronger than the critics pretend.&quot; The journal declares, for instance, that there is no solidarity of feeling in India nor the faintest possibility of popular government there, ancl that this is also the case in Egypt where an overwhelming majority of the population would be slow indeed to exchange the inveterate honesty of the British rule for a &quot; sort of Coptic tammany.&quot;&quot; There are convincing reasons,&quot; continues the journal, &quot; why the British self-goveruing colonies do not cut the painter; notably, because in all relations with foreign Powers, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa are all in an incomparably stronger position than if they were independent. Every Canadian knows this, and Canada is the most favourably suited to set up business on her own
account; similarly, Australia, with a small population spread over an enormous -country much of which owing to its climate is unsuitable for&apos; European but not for Asiatic settlement, would soon find herself arguing at a disadvantage with Japan. &apos; British solidarity &apos; is an important matter for us all to consider. The exhilarating sport of twisting the lion&apos;s tail has been lamentably overdone. It is well to remember that the lion is still a complete and healthy animal with all the attributes -of lions, plus an astonishingly good temper.&quot;Administration of South-West Africa. Telegraphing from AVi,ndhuk on 2nd February, ReuteFs agent reported that Mr. Gysbert Reitz Hofmeyr, C.M.G., Administrator of South-West Africa, had that day presided at the first meeting of the -advisory council, formed to assist in the administration of the country and composed of six members representing the various interests and sections of the population, appointed by the Governor-General.In the course of an opening address, Mr. Hofmeyr declared he thought it would be impossible to find a council more representative of all interests in South-West Africa.One of the members of the council is Major Manning, specially appointed to look -after the interests of the natives.The Hand Strike. ReuteFs agent sent the following telegram from Johannesburg -on 12th February : The position on the Rand is extremely confused. The original strike at the Langlaagte mines was, from a trade union point of view, unauthorized and irregular, and has been emphatically disapproved by the general executive of the miners&apos; union and also by the governing body of the federation of trades as a breach -of agreement with tbe chamber of mines. Unfortunately, the extremists have succeeded in extending the strike, and a ballot is now being held at. the instance of the general executive of the miners&apos; union to decide for or against a general strike in support of the Langlaagte men. An, important meeting of the executives of the unions affiliated to the federation was held yesterday evening to consider a reply to the chamber of mines&apos; demands that the men should return to work, and a resolution was passed advising the acceptance of the -chambePs offer in view of the serious economic position of the mining industry.
