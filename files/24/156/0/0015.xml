GREAT BRITAIN.The Labour Situation. The following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the fortnight ending 7th April 1920 : The general situation is much more quiet than it was a fortnight ago, when it was disturbed by a large number of wage demands in important industries, and the prospect of reaching a settlement on all of these without a strike seemed somewhat remote. During the past fortnight, however, a settlement has been reached on all the matters&apos; on which the Transport Workers&apos; Federation was negotiating, and the agreements have been received with satisfaction on the whole, although local strikes have taken place owing to opposition to the tramway settlement.The Easter week-end saw a large number of annual conferences of trade unions and Socialist parties. The main subject of interest at the conferences of the latter has been the question of their international affiliation.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Succession to the Sultanate-Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 339] on 8th April that the Sultan had told him of the importance that he attached to the recognition of his son. He was especially desirous that His Majesty&apos;s Government should confirm his son in the succession before Adly Pasha reached Paris, in order that any idea existing in Egypt that the Sultanate could be used as a pawn in negotiations between Egyptian party representatives and His Majesty&apos;s Government might be entirely dissipated. Lord Allenby expressed the opinion that the immediate recognition of Prince Farouq would have a telling effect in Egypt at the present juncture, and would in fact strengthen the influences favourable to compromise with His Majesty&apos;s Government, which it was said were inducing Adly Pasha to go to Paris. In response to this message Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 325]: on 10th April approval of the proposal to recognized Prince Farouq as rightful heir to the throne and similarly his male successors in order of primogeniture.The terms of the communication on this decision,.which it is proposed to make to the Sultan, have been submitted by Lord Allenby, and are under cou-sideration.RHODESIA., Labour Troubles. ReuteFs Bulawayo Agent reported on 28th March that the railway strike had ended. By the terms of the settlement the men were to receive an increase of 25 percent, in wages,. an additional allowance to meet the increased cost of living, and a number of other concessions. With a view of minimising the possibility of further disputes, the Whitley Council system was to be introduced.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [fXE.lt., xiv., p. 5]. On 25th March the Viceroy telegraphed [332 S.] a reasoned report of the policy it was proposed to adopt as regards Waziristan. It appears to be agreed among all officers, civil and military, that the permanent occupation of a commanding position in central Waziristan is the solution of the problem to ensure peace and security in that area, and to eliminate the temptation to the Afghans which the present weakness of our position in that quarter constantly offers. The Indian Government considers that it would be a mistake to forgo the advantage which has been gained by our forces of occupying a commanding central position, in view of the fact that our terms to the Mansuds and Wazirs have not yet been complied with, and that sufficient reliance could not be placed on their professions. of compliance and submission to justify our withdrawal.After detailing the military measures of occupation and investigating the require-ments and cost, the Viceroy points out &quot;the undesirability of moving troops now, in view of the approach of the hot weather, the incomplete compliance with our terms by
the Mahsuds, and the possibility of the Wana Wazirs enquiring our terms and offering submission.The Indian Government have been urged by Indian politicians and by-the vernacular Press to adopt a policy of more stringent control over the predatory tribes on the Waziristan borders, ancl are confident that they will be widely supported in India in the effective scheme which they now propose. The two alternative courses which present themselves are, first, to push permanent military posts further into the tribal country, and to base them on sound lines of communication, or, second, to abandon the control of the tribal country altogether, and to attempt to restrain raiders by a line of posts along the unhealthy district of the foot hills. The latter course would fail to provide protection for the settled districts of Derajat, ancl would expose Gumal and Zhob. The Indian Government, therefore, have been forced to the -conclusion that they must take the first alternative, and that the line of occupation they advocate,.in addition to being already won, is-also strategically the soundest.The Caliphate Question [B.E.R., xiv., p. 2]. -Telegraphing on 25th March, the Viceroy reported that in spite of fiery speeches and resolutions the Hartal on the 19th passed off more quietly than might have been expected, and that the Hindus participated to a large extent. The local Mohamedans in Bombay, are opposed to the proposed boycott of British goods on commercial grounds, ancl the Hindus have held aloof. The extremistTIindus, however, are very active, and many of them were present at a secret meeting which was recently held at Delhi to consider how the Calcutta Caliphate resolutions should be followed up, in the event of the --minimum of the Moslems in regard to the Turkish peace terms not being accepted. While, on the one hand, an immediate jehad was proposed, general acceptance was given to the progressive measures advocated by Gandhi, based on a plan of non-co-operation, which includes the resignation of government titles and honorary offices, to be followed by the resignation of service by government and domestic servants, and later by boycott of the army and refusal to pay taxes.In his weekly telegram dated 31st March, the Viceroy reported that the Mohamedans who took part in the secret meeting referred to above, proceeded to Meerut to the third sitting of the provincial Caliphate Conference, where Gandhi announced the plan of action approved at Delhi. At the time of telegraphing, the Viceroy thought the movement was apparently not gaining strength.In a further report dated 7th April the Viceroy stated that Gandhi&apos;s scheme received its first application by Hakim Ajmal Khan resigning the titles conferred on him by the Government of India by way of protest against the want of attention of English statesmen to the Caliphate question. The Prime mini steps speech to the Caliphate deputation, which was not favourably received at first, except by the&apos; English Press, was now reported from Bombay to have had a sobering effect generally, -and to have given rise to the hopcrthat the settlement would be such that Mohamedans as a whole could accept it without damage to their amour propre. The principal objection was against the Greeks getting any hold. In Bengal, while there was at present no agitation, the feeling was reported to be restless. Prom the Punjab also the report was disquieting, as fanatics ancl extremists were exploiting the bitter feeling which had been aroused among Mohamedans by the recent events in Constantinople. It was thought that efforts might be made to corrupt the Indian -Army, and fanatical preachers were already reviling Pathans, Punjabis and Mohameclaus who fought against the Turks. The general impression appeared to be that the Caliphate deputation to England had not done much good, ancl that Indian sentiment in regard to Turkey was not receiving sufficient attention. On the other hand, public opinion was inclining to the view that the Calcutta Caliphate Conference had gone much too far.Shiak Action. In his telegram of 25th March the Viceroy reported the issue by the Shiah Mujtahids of Lucknow of a manifesto denouncing the Caliphate agitation for introducing considerations of temporal power into a purely religious question. On 7th April the Viceroy announced that an all-India Sliia.tr conference had begun at Nagpur on 4th April. The President had cautioned the Shiah community against traversing dangerous ground, ancl laid it down that while the existence,ol Islamic powers and the preservation of holy places must be matters of great concern to all Moslems, it was their duty to announce unequivocally that the Sultan of Turkey was not, and could not be, their religious head. On that account they could not sever their loyal connexion with the British Government. This action of the Shiahs was reported by the United Provinces Government to be having a good effect.
THE DOMINIONS.Belief for Austria and Poland.-On 9th April the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa as follows: As your Ministers are aware, the economic situation in Central Europe is most serious, and the cpiestion of arrangements for its relief has been under the considera-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government. The United States Grain Corporation, on account of the United States Government, has now agreed to supply about 400,000 tons of cereals to Austria and Poland on credit, and His Majesty&apos;s Government has undertaken to open a credit not exceeding one half of the contribution of the United States Government, within the- limit of 10,000,OOOL, out of which in the first place shipping for the transportation of the cereals is being provided. The terms of credit are not yet decided, but it is understood that the conditions of repayment to other contributing Governments will be not less favourable than those as regards repayment to the United States Government.A conference of representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Govern-ments of France, United States, Italy, Scandinavia, Holland and Switzerland is being summoned to meet at Paris, on or shortly after 15th April, to settle detailed arrange-meuts-in connexion with the credits; and should your Government agiee in principle to participate in the scheme of relief a representative nominated by them would be cordially welcomed at the Conference.Similar invitations to participate in this scheme of relief had already been sent to the Governments of Canada, Australia, and Hew Zealand. To the Government of Canada the suggestion was made that a provision of fats, cattle-hides, cod-liver oil, nickel, aluminium, asbestos, and agricultural machinery would be most useful; a similar suggestion was made to the Government of Australia for a supply of copper, lead, zinc ore, mother-o&apos;-pearl, tin, tungsten ore, hides, and, when available, wool; and to the Government of New Zealand for tungsten ore, hides, and, when available, wool.Proposed Imperial Holiday. On 8th April the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Officer Administering the Government of Canada, the Governor of Newfoundland, and the Governors-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of South Africa :  A suggestion has been made by the New Zealand Government that an imperial holiday should be set aside annually in celebration of the victory and conclusion of peace. The matter has been under consideration, and in-the opinion-of His Majesty&apos;s Government the anniversary, of the armistice, 11th November, would be the most suitable date for the commemoration of the victory and peace. I should be glad to be furnished with the views of your Ministers, who will understand that the above expression of opinion docs not bind His Majesty&apos;s Government to the institution of an annual statutory holiday on armistice day.The telegram, referred to was as follows : The Government of New Zealand have had under consideration on several occasions a proposal that the 25th April should be called &quot; Anzac Day,&quot; and declared an. annual statutory holiday in commemoration of the landing on Gallipoli. It is now suggested that the Imperial Government might set apart one imperial holiday annually by way of celebrating the victory and peace throughout the Empire. My Ministers would be glad to learn the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.To this a reply was sent on 8th April in practically the same terms as those contained in the telegram to the Governors-General of the other Dominions.Officers and Men of the Royal Navy serving in the Dominions. On 1st April the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Officer administering the Government of Canada and the Governors-General of the Common-wealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and Newfoundland : -Doubts having arisen as to the legal position of officers and men of the Royal Navy who may be transferred, or fent to, or find themselves serving in Dominion vessels, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to seek the sanction of Parliament for a Bill to the following effect: &quot; That any officer or man in or belonging to His
Majesty&apos;s Navy, and who by order of! the Admiralty is serving in the Navy of any self-governing Dominion or under the orders of an officer of a self-governing Dominion, shall be subject to the laws and customs for the time being in force of such self-governing Dominion.&quot; I should be glad to know whether your Ministers concur.CANADA.Admiralty Nasal Staff-On 8th April the Officer administering the Government of Canada informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the proposal of the Admiralty in regard to the representation of the naval forces of the Dominions on its Naval Staff [B.E.R., xiii.,. p. 6] met with the concurrence of the Government of Canada, but at the present time there were no officers of the Royal Canadian Navy considered to be sufficiently senior for the appointment, either for training in staff work or for attachment to the Naval Staff at the Admiralty.Enemy Debts Clearing House, On 10th April the Officer administering the Government of Canada telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in reply to his telegram of 24th March [B.E.R., xiv., p. 6] saying that the Government of Canada proposed to adopt&apos; the second alternative referred to therein, and that the share of the administrative cost of the central clearing office and representative in Germany to be paid by Canada could be readily arranged.Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria. On 10th April the Officer administering the Government of Canada reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that a Minute of Council of the 9th April asked that His Majesty the King should be humbly moved to approve, accept, confirm and ratify the treaty with Bulgaria for and in respect of the Dominion of Canada.Representation at Washington. On 1st April the Officer administering the Government of Canada telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : With reference to your telegram of 24th March [B.E.R., xiv., p. 7], in regard to the Canadian representation at Washington, the Canadian Government^ under-standing is that the Canadian Minister who is to be appointed Minister Plenipotentiary should, in accordance with his rank as Minister Plenipotentiary, have precedence in the diplomatic corps. Analogous cases are those of Saxony and Bavaria before the war, since these States maintained Ministers at European Courts concurrently with the Ambassador of the German. Empire.If the State Department should not wish to make a formal ruling giving precedence to the Canadian Minister with the Ministers of other countries, they could in the last resort, perhaps, reach the same result by intimating that they would, as a matter of practice, accord such precedence without calling special attention to it. In view, however, of the question being possibly raised in future by the Ministers of other countries, it would be preferable to have a formal agreement.Air Force. The Director of Information announced, on 7th April, that Canada was about to organize a volunteer air force of 5,000 men, who would be recruited from men who had formerly served in the Royal Air Porce.Business Conditions. From all parts of the Dominion business conditions are reported to be satisfactory, the bank clearings in. the first week of April being 40 per cent, in excess of those for the corresponding period last year.Immigration [B.E.R., xii., p. 7].- -The High Commissioner has received infor-mation that 2,000 immigrants entered Canada from the British Isles, and 1,950 from the United States, during February.AUSTRALIA.United States Senate Reservations [B.E.R., xiii., p. 5]. On 30th March the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies received a telegram from the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia saying that his Prime Minister desired him to point out that his telegram of 14th November made it clear that the Commonwealth Government was not prepared to agree to abandon its right to sit on the League of Nations on an equal footing with other small Powers, and consequently that it was unable to agree 15-2 B
to the Lenroot reservation. This applied to the amendment whether in the modified or the original form. His Prime Minister added: &quot;I assume that the definite &quot; rejection of the Treaty by the United States Senate has now completely changed the &quot; position and that the question of reservations upon the-Treaty does not and cannot arise unless and until this rejection is rescinded.&quot;International Labour Conference. On 31st March the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in reply to the latter&apos;s telegram of 5th February [B.E.R., xi., p, 9] in regard to a special meeting of the International Labour Conference to consider the seamen questions at Genoa on 15th June, saying that the Government of the Commonwealth would, arrange for the attendance of two delegates representing respectively shipowners and seamen.Certificates of Origin. On 1st April the.Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia saying :-Referring to your telegrams of the 3rd February and 2nd March, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has carefully examined the proposals as regards certificates of origin, but fears that the results likely to be achieved would not be commensurate, with the difficulties involved. For reasons already explained [B.E.R., v., p. 6], goods forwarded to Australia from enemy or ex-enemy countries via the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire would under present conditions escape the requirement of a certificate of origin. As regards Czecho-Slovakia and other States removed from the jurisdiction of Austria, the above argument also applies, and besides it is thought that it would be of little use to require certificates in the case of direct exports unless the system were extended to goods of all the neighbouring States. Otherwise goods from Czecho-Slovakia, &amp;c.,need be only taken over the frontiers and re-exported in order to avoid compliance with the requirements of the Commonwealth Govern-ment. Further, it is most undesirable to place any avoidable hindrance on the resumption of trade, with Czecho-Slovakia and other new friendly States, whose economic difficulties are already great. In these circumstances it is hoped that your Ministers will be ready to withdraw both their proposals. In any case, having regard to the recent reduction of the consular staff, considered essential in the interests of economy after the cessation of hostilities and the general abandonment of the certi-ficate of origin system, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs apprehends that, even if other difficulties could be surmounted, it is unlikely that Consuls could carry out the wishes of the Commonwealth Government with any prospect of efficiency.Ulnemy Debts and Mandated Territories. On 20th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Governors-General of the Common-wealth of Australia and New Zealand: To my,telegram of 8th February in regard to the enemy debts notice given to Germany for territories in respect of which Dominion Governments may receive mandates, the Government of Germany replied on 12th February that the period of one month provided for by Article 296 (E) having elapsed, they reserved their attitude in respect of this notice; their attitude being apparently that as mandates did not exist before the 10th February, when the mouth expired, mandated territories cannot be considered as having notified their adherence to the Article. In order to avoid the delay which must result if all action be deferred until the mandates come into force, it is proposed to suggest to the Government of Germany the reference of the question to a mixed arbitral tribunal, to -which the matter would appear to fall for decision in default of an agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Germany under the Annex to Article 296. I should be glad to learn as soon as possible whether your Ministers concur.In reply ihereto the following was received from the Governor-General of Australia on 29th March : As the principle of these mandates is embodied in the Treaty of Versailles, to which Germany and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia have subscribed, and the Council of Four duly appointed the Commonwealth as mandatory for the islands in the South Pacific, other than Samoa and Nauru, the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia cannot agree to any course that raises the question of its rights under the Treaty and the decision of Council.And on 26th March this from the Governor-General of New Zealand : My Government concur in the suggestion to refer the question, to a mixed arbitral tribunal for decision, in default of an agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the
Government of Germany, and is desirous that His Majesty&apos;s Government should act in the matter as it thinks best.Labour Position in Nauru. On 17th March the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand : The Pacific Phosphate Company, in view of the exigencies of the labour -position in Nauru, owing to reduced recruiting and its probable cessation in islands under Japanese control, wish to engage immediately 200 Chinese coolies and 125 Chinese boatmen, all unindentured. Immediately before the war, 532 Chinese were employed ; at present 220, of whom 31 are mechanics and 81 coolies, are due for repatriation this year. The Company suggest alternatively the engagement of Javanese, but it is doubtful whether they could be obtained. I presume your Government will not object to the use of Chinese in Nauru,N having regard to the importance of maintaining the output after the transfer.&apos; ?In reply to this, the Governor-General of Australia telegraphed on 26th March saying that, as the formal acquisition of the right of the Pacific Phosphate Company had not taken place, the Commonwealth Government expressed no opinion on the question.Three days later the Governor-General of New Zealand reported that his Govern-ment had no objection to the use of Chinese in view of the importance of maintaining the output of phosphates.- NEW ZEALAND.Enemy Debts and Mandated Territories. See above under &quot; Australia.&quot; Nauru. See above under &quot; Australia.&quot;Enemy Nationals in the Samoan Islands. On the 12th April the Governor-General of New Zealand informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Government of New Zealand had decided, on the recommendation of the Administrator of the Samoan Islands, to compulsorily repatriate from the Samoan Islands all enemy nationals who were without Samoan family ties. There were 19-1 men, women, and children, 2nd class, and 11 men, women and children, 3rd class, to be transported. It was desired that the steamer should call at Apia en route to England to embark these Germans, as there was grave objection to bringing them to New Zealand for embarkation. The New Zealand Overseas Shipping Committee were unable to provide accommodation in the regular traders, and had cabled the Shipping Controller recommending that an armistice boat should be made available for this transport. The Government of New Zealand regarded the matter as one of great, urgency, and was anxious the Shipping Controller should be urged to make every effort to provide the transport required by the earliest possible date.Control of insulated Shipping by the Imperial Government. On 8th April the following telegram was sent by the Governor-General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : The welfare of New Zealand is largely dependent upon the maintenance of regular services of insulated steamers carrying exportable produce at such freight rates as are reasonable in view of current conditions, and a feeling is growing among producers that they should take steps to secure a service of insulated ships owned by themselves. In order to ensure this my Ministers realize that prior to the war the shipping companies trading to New Zealand provided a good service in every way, aud it is hoped that these companies will again do all that is necessary to meet the producers&apos; requirements when the present control ceases. My Prime Minister has been in communication with the New Zealand representatives of the shipping-companies, but they quite reasonably state that they cannot give any indication regarding the rates of freight which will be fixed for privately owned produce until their respective companies are in a position to know when the Imperial Government control will cease. The Prime Minister asks whether His Majesty&apos;s Government is yet in a position to state when the control of insulated shipping will be relinquished, and he would be glad to be informed as soon as possible. The information is desired for the guidance of Ministers in dealing with the question of the suggested farmers&apos; shipping line, should it again arise.Samoa and Javanese Labour. On 1st April the Secretary- of State for the Colonies received a telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand asking if it 15-2 C
S would be possible now for the Government of New Zealand to engage Javanese labourers, under indenture for three years, to work on Samoan plantations. The Javanese were strongly recommended for this class of work ; and the New Zealand Government would be glad to know whether, this source of labour could be made available in addition to or possibly as an alternative to the Chinese.   .   -SOUTH AFRICA.Transvaal-Mozambique Convention. On 7th April Lord Milner telegraphed as follows to the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa:  The following note, dated 30th - March, has been received from the Portuguese Minister:  -The Portuguese Government, together with the Government of Mozambique, have decided not to formally denounce the Transvaal-Mozambique Convention of 1st April 1909 providing the Government of the Union of South Africa accepts to start, without delay, negotiations for the drawing up between the two Govern-ments of a new convention which should come into operation as soon as it has been discussed and approved.This resolution has already been transmitted to the Government of the Union of South Africa, and it was further stated that the Government of Mozambique would continues to grant facilities for the recruiting of natives for the mines, south of parallel 2s, who are not indispensable for the industrial and agricultural development of the province.The new clauses would be as follows : (1) Confirmation of prohibition to recruit north of parallel 22.(2) Revision of share in tariffs for exportations from the Transvaal to Lourenco Marques, railway rates and others.(3) Facilities for the Government of Mozambique to modify the wharf duties r; - and others in Lourenco Marques relative to imports and exports.The Portuguese Government would be very grateful to His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment if they would be good enough to use their good offices with the Government of the Union of South Africa in order that negotiations may be entered into with the least possible delay on the terms indicated above.In commtmicating this.note the Portuguese Minister expressed the hope of his Government that your Government would place itself in direct touch with the Government of Mozambique for the purpose of discussing the terms of the proposed new convention.Mandate for German Sovth-West Africa. In reply to a message received from . the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa on 2nd April, the Secretary.of State for the Colonies telegraphed as follows on 6th april the Supreme Council at its meeting of 24th December adopted the draft Conventions relating to the mandate for German East Africa subject to examination by the drafting Committee, but, owing to the attitude taken up by the Japanese representative, did not adopt the draft Conventions relating to mandates for the Pacific and South-West Africa. It has not been possible to make any progress with the draft Conventions relating to the mandates fpr the Pacific and South-West Africa, as the Japanese reservation has not yet been withdrawn.&quot; . &apos;Application for Surplus War. Skips.-The Governor-General for the Union of South Africa informed the Secretary of State for the . Colonies that Captain Davis, a Durban shipping agent, proposed to present two ships to the Union for training South African boys as officers and seamen for the Mercantile Marine, and was leaving for England to purchase the ships. His Ministers suggested that the Admiralty might be prepared to dispose of surplus naval craft for this purpose, and asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government should facilitate Captain Davis&apos;s mission.Extension of Lord Buxton&apos;s Term of Office. ReuteFs agent, reported from Capetown on 27th March that general satisfaction was expressed at the,announcement that Lord Buxton had consented to a further extension of his Governor-Generalship at. the request of the Union and Imperial Governments. This was voiced by the Cape Times, which said that for the second time his Excellency had yielded his personal interests to the needs of a difficult situation. In deference, continued the paper, to the general sentiment throughout the Union, which was unanimous in.
recognizing him as the right man in the right place, his Excellency once more, with a high sense of duty, had put aside all interests save those of the country he had served so faithfully and with such distinction. It need hardly be said that his sacrifice would tide over a delicate situation until the end of the present session of Parliament. After referring to the difficulties which would have confronted a new Governor-General without a shrewd and intimate knowledge of all the personal factors involved in the political situation, the Cape Times said : -&quot; At the same time &quot; it must be recognized that it is a severe additional task that Lord Buxton loyally &quot;shoulders at the close of a long and signally successful Governor-Generalship, &quot; which,in his case has not been the grave of a reputation, but the crowning phase of &quot; a most unselfish and honourable career.&quot;The Political Crisis. Telegraphing from Capetown on Oth April, ReutePs agent reported that it was asserted in Nationalist circles that General Smuts had approached the Nationalists, Unionists and Labour representatives, with a proposal to form &quot; a best man Government &quot; and that the Nationalists had officially replied that they were not prepared to take part in such a Government, but that they were prepared to co-operate with the South African Party on the understanding that the Nationalists did not push Republican propaganda in Parliament, while the South African Party on their side guaranteed not. to oppose the movement. General Smuts was said to have refused. The Labour representatives were reported to have also refused General Smuts&apos; proposal.Telegraphing again two days later he said that the general consensus of opinion regarding the political crisis was that General Smuts would carry on the Government, that the Unionists would not withhold their support, and that the Labour members would refrain from taking the responsibility of defeating the Government ancl thereby frustrating the economic and social reforms to which they were committed. Despite the Labour members&apos; rejection of General Smuts&apos; original overtures, it is understood that this is not regarded in any way as a final decision in the matter of the co-operation of parties standing by the Constitution. General Smuts&apos; patience, statesmanship and unwavering courage to face what almost seemed a deadlock had drawn many tributes from the Unionists aud. South African Party Press.South African Rents and Profiteering Bills. ReutePs Agent telegraphed from Capetown on 27th March as follows :  The Governments Rents and Profiteering Bills, introduced into the Union House of Assembly, have now been published. The former provides for the establishment of local Rent Boards with powers to investigate and reduce unreasonable rents ; &quot; unreasonable &quot; being defined as a gross return exceeding 12 per cent, on the rateable valuation.The Profiteering Bill closely follows the British measure, and establishes a Board of Control, replacing the present Cost of Living Commission. It also establishes local committees on whicli specific powers may be conferred by proclamation. Magistrates are authorised to, inflict a fine of 5001. or 12 months&apos; imprisonment, or both.
